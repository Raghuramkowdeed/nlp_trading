ITEM 10. DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT
 
DIRECTORS
 
    The name of, principal occupation of, and certain additional information
about each of the three nominees and the three current directors with unexpired
terms are set forth below. On August 5, 1997, all of the members of the Board
other than Messrs. Woolard and Chang resigned and were replaced by Steven P.
Jobs, Lawrence J. Ellison, William V. Campbell and Jerome B. York. One Class II
director seat remained unfilled on Apple's Board after August 5, 1997 and,
pursuant to an amendment to the Company's by-laws, has been eliminated, thereby
reducing the number of directors on the Board from seven to six.
 
    Listed below are the Class II directors to be nominated for re-election at
the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting"). In
connection with the Annual Meeting, it is expected that shareholders will be
asked to approve an amendment to the Company's Restated Articles of
Incorporation which would, if approved, eliminate the classification of the
Board and ensure that each director will stand for election annually. If
shareholders approve the proposal to declassify the Board, all of the directors
elected at the Annual Meeting will serve a one-year term expiring at the next
annual meeting of shareholders.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
 
    Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires
the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent
of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of
securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Officers, directors and greater than ten
percent shareholders also are required by rules promulgated by the SEC to
furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
 
    Based solely upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the
Company, the absence of a Form 3 or Form 5 or written representations that no
Forms 5 were required, the Company believes that, during fiscal year 1997, its
officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners complied with
all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements.

(1) Based on an aggregate of 19,629,231 options granted to all employees during
    fiscal year 1997, including 7,866,155 options granted in exchange for the
    cancellation of the same number of outstanding options as of July 11, 1997
    on a one-for-one basis pursuant to the Exchange Program. This amount does
    not include (i) NeXT options which were converted into Apple options during
    fiscal year 1997 in connection with Apple's acquisition of NeXT or (ii)
    Apple options granted to Dr. Amelio during fiscal year 1996 which were
    subject to shareholder approval obtained during fiscal year 1997. Options
    vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary
    of the date of grant.
 
(2) All options were granted at an exercise price equal to fair market value
    based on the closing market value of Common Stock on the Nasdaq National
    Market on the trading day immediately preceding the date of grant. For
    administrative purposes, the Board on November 5, 1997 amended the Company's
    stock option plans to provide that the exercise price of options granted
    under such plans will be the fair market value based on the closing market
    value on the date of grant.
 
(3) Potential gains are net of exercise price, but before taxes associated with
    exercise. These amounts represent certain assumed rates of appreciation
    only, based on SEC rules, and do not represent the Company's estimate or
    projection of the price of the Company's stock in the future. Actual gains,
    if any, on stock option exercises depend upon the actual future price of
    Common Stock and the continued employment of the option holders throughout
    the vesting period. Accordingly, the potential realizable values set forth
    in this table may not be achieved.
 
(4) Mr. Jobs was granted 30,000 stock options in his capacity as a director of
    the Company pursuant to the Director Plan, subject to the approval of the
    Director Plan by shareholders at the Annual Meeting.
 
(5) Grants of stock options pursuant to the Exchange Program in exchange for the
    cancellation of outstanding stock options. The first grant of stock options
    listed in the table above for each of Messrs. Anderson, De Luca and
    Rubinstein was canceled in connection with the Exchange Program and is no
    longer outstanding.
 
(6) All stock options held by Messrs. De Luca and Calderoni were forfeited upon
    their termination of employment.

target bonus will thereafter be reviewed annually by the Company. In fiscal year
1997, however, no cash bonuses were paid under the Bonus Plan. During fiscal
year 1997, the Company paid Mr. Anderson the second half of an $800,000 hiring
bonus. If Mr. Anderson's employment is terminated by the Company without "Cause"
at any time during the five-year period following April 1, 1996, he will be
entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment equal to the sum of his annual
base salary and target bonus. Mr. Anderson's agreement generally defines "Cause"
to include a felony conviction, willful disclosure of confidential information
or willful and continued failure to perform his employment duties.
 
    The Company entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Hancock, effective
July 8, 1996, pursuant to which she served as Executive Vice President and Chief
Technology Officer until her termination of employment on July 25, 1997.
Pursuant to her agreement, Ms. Hancock was entitled to receive a base salary of
$480,000 and a bonus of $360,000 during fiscal year 1997. Upon Ms. Hancock's
termination of employment with the Company, she received $480,000 in a lump sum
severance payment.
 
    The Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Calderoni,
effective July 8, 1996, pursuant to which he served as Senior Vice President,
Corporate Controller until his termination of employment on November 7, 1997.
Pursuant to his agreement, Mr. Calderoni was entitled to receive a base salary
of $275,000 and was guaranteed a minimum bonus of $75,000 for fiscal year 1997.
 
    CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS--STOCK OPTIONS
 
    In the event of a "change in control" of the Company, all outstanding
options under the Company's stock option plans will, unless otherwise determined
by the plan administrator, become exercisable in full,
 
                                       9
<PAGE>
and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the
applicable "change in control price" and the exercise price. A "change in
control" under these plans is generally defined as (i) the acquisition by any
person of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding
securities or (ii) the occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder
approval and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.
 
    CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS--RETENTION AGREEMENTS
 
    The Company is currently party to retention agreements (the "RETENTION
AGREEMENTS") with two Named Executive Officers (Messrs. Anderson and Rubinstein)
providing for certain cash payments in the event of a termination of an
executive's employment following a change in control of the Company. For
purposes of the Retention Agreements, a "change in control" is defined as (i) a
reorganization, merger, consolidation or other corporate transaction in which
the holders of voting stock of the Company immediately before the corporate
transaction will not own more than 50% of the voting shares of the continuing or
surviving corporation immediately after such corporate transaction, (ii) the
acquisition of 30% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's
then-outstanding securities, (iii) a change of 50% in the membership of the
Board within a two-year period, unless the election or nomination for election
by shareholders of an adequate number of directors within such period was
approved by the vote of at least three-fourths of the directors then still in
office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose
election or nomination for election was previously so approved, (iv) all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company are sold, liquidated or
distributed, or (v) a "change in control" or a "change in the effective control"
of the Company within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
 
    In the event of an Involuntary Termination (as defined in the Retention
Agreements) of any executive officer who is a party to a Retention Agreement
within two years following a change in control, such executive officer will
receive a cash payment equal to the sum of (i) three times his annual base
salary immediately prior to the date of his termination or, if greater, the
highest annualized base salary in effect during the three-year period ending on
the change in control, and (ii) three times his target bonus for the year in
which the termination occurs or, if greater, the highest target annual bonus
applicable to the executive officer in any of the three years ending prior to
the change in control. In addition, the executive officer would be eligible to
participate in the medical, dental, health, life and other fringe benefit plans
and arrangements applicable to him until the second anniversary of his date of
termination.
 
    The Retention Agreements further provide that, in the event of an
Involuntary Termination of an executive officer on or following a change in
control, such executive officer's equity awards granted to him under the
Company's equity-based incentive plans (the "EQUITY PLANS") will vest and become
exercisable. All equity awards also will vest and become exercisable as of the
date of a change in control as defined in the Equity Plans, regardless of
whether the executive officer's employment has then terminated. Subject to
certain limits on payments, the Retention Agreements also require tax gross-up
payments to the executive officers to mitigate any excise tax imposed on the
executive officers under Section 4999 of the Code in connection with a change in
control.
 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 
    In connection with the Company's use of an aircraft owned by Aero Ventures,
an entity wholly owned by Dr. Amelio, the Company made monthly payments of
approximately $14,000 to Aero Ventures during fiscal year 1997 through the date
of Dr. Amelio's termination of employment. The Company also paid for certain
other expenses, including pilot and copilot fees, parking and landing fees and
simulator training and fuel expenses. During fiscal year 1997, the Company paid
approximately $471,461 to Aero Ventures in the aggregate. Pursuant to the terms
of Dr. Amelio's separation agreement, the Company's obligation to make payments
in connection with the use of his aircraft ended upon his termination of
employment.
 
                                       10
<PAGE>
    Pursuant to the terms of Dr. Amelio's employment agreement with the Company,
the Company extended a $5 million loan to Dr. Amelio in February 1996, which was
to be repaid over a period of 5 years. The largest aggregate amount of
indebtedness outstanding on this loan during fiscal year 1997 was $5 million.
Upon the termination of Dr. Amelio's employment with the Company, $1.5 million
of his severance was immediately applied in partial repayment of the outstanding
loan balance. Pursuant to Dr. Amelio's employment agreement, the loan was to
become due and payable on the 90th day after his termination of employment.
However, in consideration for Dr. Amelio's executing a release of the Company
from certain legal claims, the Company agreed to extend the maturity date of the
loan to September 15, 1998. The loan bears interest at the rate of 7% and is
secured by real estate owned by Dr. Amelio.
 
    In connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company loaned James
McCluney (Senior Vice President, Operations) $100,000 bearing interest at the
rate of 7.31%. The largest amount of the indebtedness outstanding on this loan
during fiscal year 1997 was $100,000.
