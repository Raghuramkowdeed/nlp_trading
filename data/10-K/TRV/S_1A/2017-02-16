ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO AND "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES."

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO

RAISE

CAPITAL AND THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE.

OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY

VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HURRICANES, TORNADOES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS, VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND OTHER

NATURALLY-OCCURRING EVENTS, SUCH AS SOLAR FLARES. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO BE MAN-MADE, SUCH AS TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER INTENTIONALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTS INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL,

CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, CYBER-ATTACKS, EXPLOSIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR BUSINESS SUBJECTS US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES AND

CANADA, WHICH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: HURRICANES FROM MAINE THROUGH TEXAS; TORNADOES AND HAIL STORMS THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL, MID-ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEASTERN REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES;

EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA, THE NEW MADRID REGION AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGION OF NORTH AMERICA; WILDFIRES, PARTICULARLY IN WESTERN STATES AND CANADA; AND TERRORISM IN MAJOR CITIES IN THE UNITED

STATES. IN ADDITION TO OUR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND BRAZIL AS

WELL AS TO A VARIETY OF WORLD-WIDE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES THROUGH OUR LLOYD'S OPERATIONS.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL AND MAN-MADE

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD INCREASE. SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES HAVE UNDERSCORED THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE CLIMATE TRENDS, AND POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD

ADD TO THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND CREATE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO FUTURE TRENDS AND EXPOSURES. FOR EXAMPLE, OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, HURRICANE ACTIVITY HAS IMPACTED

AREAS FURTHER INLAND THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED BY US, AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES HAVE RESULTED IN LARGER POPULATIONS IN COASTAL AREAS WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO SEVERE STORMS AND RELATED

STORM SURGE, THUS EXPANDING OUR POTENTIAL FOR LOSSES FROM HURRICANES. ADDITIONALLY, BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TORNADO AND HAIL STORMS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN MORE VOLATILE DURING THE

LAST DECADE. MOREOVER, WE COULD EXPERIENCE MORE THAN ONE SEVERE CATASTROPHIC EVENT IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.

ALL

OF THE CATASTROPHE MODELING TOOLS THAT WE USE, OR THAT WE RELY ON FROM OUTSIDE PARTIES, TO EVALUATE CERTAIN OF OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT

ARE SUBJECT TO ERROR AND MIS-ESTIMATION AND MAY PRODUCE ESTIMATES THAT ARE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN ACTUAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, COMPARED TO MODELS FOR HURRICANES, MODELS FOR EARTHQUAKES ARE LESS

RELIABLE DUE TO THERE BEING A MORE LIMITED NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL EVENTS TO ANALYZE, WHILE MODELS FOR TORNADOES AND HAIL STORMS ARE NEWER AND MAY BE EVEN LESS RELIABLE DUE TO THE HIGHLY

RANDOM GEOGRAPHIC NATURE AND SIZE OF THESE EVENTS. AS A RESULT, MODELS FOR EARTHQUAKES AND TORNADO AND HAIL STORMS MAY HAVE EVEN

GREATER DIFFICULTY PREDICTING RISKS AND ESTIMATING LOSSES. FURTHER, CHANGES IN CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD CAUSE OUR UNDERLYING MODELING DATA TO BE LESS PREDICTIVE, THUS LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO

EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE AND MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK. AS COMPARED TO NATURAL CATASTROPHES, MODELING FOR MAN-MADE CATASTROPHES, SUCH AS TERRORISM, IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AND LESS RELIABLE, AND FOR SOME

EVENTS, CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO RELIABLE MODELING TECHNIQUES. SEE "WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS PROVIDE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS" BELOW AS

WELL AS "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING" AND "CHANGING CLIMATE

CONDITIONS."

THE

EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT, THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT AND THE COVERAGE PROVIDED,

WHICH CAN BE BOTH PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COVERAGES. INCREASES IN THE VALUE AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF INSURED PROPERTY, THE NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS EXPOSED TO CERTAIN EVENTS AND THE EFFECTS OF

INFLATION COULD INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF CLAIMS FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION IMPACTED BY TORNADOES IS INHERENTLY RANDOM AND UNPREDICTABLE AND

THE SPECIFIC LOCATION IMPACTED BY A TORNADO MAY OR MAY NOT BE HIGHLY POPULATED AND MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF OUR INSURED EXPOSURES.

STATES

HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME PASSED LEGISLATION, AND REGULATORS HAVE TAKEN ACTION, THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK, SUCH AS

LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS FROM REDUCING EXPOSURES OR WITHDRAWING FROM CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS OR MANDATING THAT INSURERS PARTICIPATE IN RESIDUAL MARKETS. PARTICIPATION IN RESIDUAL MARKET

MECHANISMS HAS RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS TO INSURERS, INCLUDING US, AND, IN CERTAIN STATES, THOSE LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH

OUR DIRECT CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE IN THOSE STATES. IF OUR COMPETITORS LEAVE THOSE STATES HAVING RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS, REMAINING INSURERS, INCLUDING US, MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN

LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE. IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE INITIATIVES AND COURT DECISIONS THAT SEEK TO EXPAND INSURANCE

COVERAGE FOR CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE POLICIES OR SEEK TO PREVENT THE APPLICATION OF DEDUCTIBLES. ALSO, OUR ABILITY TO ADJUST TERMS, INCLUDING DEDUCTIBLE LEVELS, OR TO

INCREASE PRICING TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO OFFSET RISING COSTS OF CATASTROPHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, REQUIRES APPROVAL OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN STATES. OUR

ABILITY OR OUR WILLINGNESS TO MANAGE OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE BY RAISING PRICES, MODIFYING UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCING EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DUE

TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND/OR CHANGES IN THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE. WE ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IN CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS THAT WE MIGHT

NOT OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING OUR ACCESS TO OTHER UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES.

THERE

ARE ALSO FACTORS THAT IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES

CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND;

EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE; BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION COSTS; LATE REPORTED CLAIMS; LITIGATION; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTABILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS AS ACTUAL

CLAIMS EMERGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

EXPOSURE

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES RESULTING FROM A CATASTROPHE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS AND COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE

CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE, RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS. A RATINGS DOWNGRADE COULD HURT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD CAUSE

US TO EXHAUST OUR AVAILABLE REINSURANCE LIMITS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE. SUCH EVENTS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE CREDIT OF OUR REINSURERS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE, SEE "ITEM 1BUSINESSREINSURANCECATASTROPHE REINSURANCE." CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE CREDIT OF

THE ISSUERS OF SECURITIES, SUCH AS STATES OR MUNICIPALITIES, IN WHICH WE HAVE INVESTED.

IN

ADDITION, COVERAGE IN OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR TERRORISM IS LIMITED. ALTHOUGH THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM PROVIDES BENEFITS IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM,

THOSE BENEFITS ARE SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS AND THE PROGRAM IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 31, 2020. UNDER CURRENT PROVISIONS OF THIS PROGRAM, ONCE OUR LOSSES EXCEED

20% OF OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PREMIUM FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE US FOR 83% OF OUR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM

WHICH EXCEED THIS DEDUCTIBLE UP TO A TOTAL INDUSTRY PROGRAM CAP OF $100 BILLION. OUR ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS $2.45 BILLION FOR 2017. OVER THE REMAINING FOUR-YEAR LIFE

OF THE REAUTHORIZED PROGRAM, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT PERCENTAGE WILL FALL FROM 83% TO 80%. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS LAW IS UNTESTED, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL

UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW IT WILL BE APPLIED TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR EXAMPLE, APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO A SPECIFIC EVENT WILL DEPEND UPON WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT HAS DESIGNATED SUCH EVENT AS A

COVERED EVENT. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE LEGISLATION COULD CHANGE OR ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY INCREASING OUR EXPOSURE TO TERRORISM LOSSES, OR BY

LOWERING OUR BUSINESS VOLUME THROUGH EFFORTS TO AVOID THAT EXPOSURE. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM, SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL OR MAN-MADE EVENTS, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK OR OTHER INTENTIONALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTS,

INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS OR CYBER-ATTACKS, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY.

FURTHER, WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING FROM A HIGH FREQUENCY OF HIGH SEVERITY NATURAL CATASTROPHES AND/OR OF MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL

MEANS. IN ADDITION, WHILE

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE

SEEK TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL MEANS, WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ONE OR MORE MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC

EVENTS INVOLVING "UNCONVENTIONAL" MEANS, SUCH AS NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS.

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED OUR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE NECESSARY, INCLUDING

AS

A RESULT OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE

ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS: CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES; ADVERSE CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS, INCLUDING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES AND TECHNOLOGY CHANGES WHICH MAY IMPACT MEDICAL,

AUTO AND HOME REPAIR COSTS; ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING GENERAL AND WAGE INFLATION; LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES; AND VARYING JUDGMENTS AND VIEWPOINTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE

ESTIMATION PROCESS, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE

ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF

OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER).

IT

IS POSSIBLE THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PAST OR FUTURE STEPS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STIMULATE THE U.S. ECONOMY, INCLUDING TAX REFORM AND CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

REGULATION, SUCH AS THE POTENTIAL FOR A DESTINATION-BASED, BORDER-ADJUSTABLE CONSUMPTION TAX SYSTEM AND/OR TARIFFS, COULD LEAD TO HIGHER INFLATION THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, WHICH COULD IN TURN LEAD TO

AN INCREASE IN OUR LOSS COSTS. THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON LOSS COSTS COULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED FOR THOSE LINES OF BUSINESS THAT ARE CONSIDERED "LONG TAIL," SUCH AS GENERAL LIABILITY, AS THEY REQUIRE A

RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. IN ADDITION, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF CLAIMS COSTS, INCLUDING THOSE IN "LONG TAIL" LINES OF BUSINESS, CONSISTS

OF MEDICAL COSTS. CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE AVAILABILITY, COST AND ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS FOR MEDICAL SERVICES, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, AS A RESULT,

INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN MEDICAL COSTS MAY INCREASE OR CLAIM FREQUENCY AND/OR SEVERITY MAY OTHERWISE BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. THE ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES MAY ALSO BE

MORE DIFFICULT DURING TIMES OF ADVERSE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS DUE TO UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR OF CLAIMANTS AND POLICYHOLDERS, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT REPORTING OF EXPOSURES AND/OR LOSSES, REDUCED MAINTENANCE OF INSURED PROPERTIES,

INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SMALL CLAIMS OR DELAYS IN THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES MAY BE INFLUENCED BY OTHER EXTERNAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING CONTINUED INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY PLAINTIFF ATTORNEYS.

WE

CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR, ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS, ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND

SETTLED, AND THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT EVOLVES. BUSINESS JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO

MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. DIFFERENT EXPERTS MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND AREAS

OF FOCUS. HENCE, SUCH EXPERTS MAY AT TIMES PRODUCE ESTIMATES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. THIS RISK MAY BE EXACERBATED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACQUISITION. EXPERTS PROVIDING INPUT TO THE VARIOUS

ESTIMATES AND UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE ACTUARIES, UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS OTHER

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MEMBERS

OF MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

WE

ATTEMPT TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED OR REVIEWED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY

UNDERLYING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ESTIMATES, THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WILL LIKELY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE

RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN IS CURRENTLY RESERVED.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM ONE INSURED EVENT, OR AN ACCUMULATION OF INSURED EVENTS, MAY EXCEED THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN

ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD,

CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

FOR

A DISCUSSION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES BY PRODUCT LINE, INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF COMMON FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT REQUIRED RESERVES, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES."

DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR DETERIORATION AND LIKELY WILL

EXPERIENCE PERIODS OF DISRUPTION OR DETERIORATION IN THE FUTURE. IF FINANCIAL MARKETS EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY LIKELY WOULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. FOR EXAMPLE, FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS HAVE RESULTED IN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCED BUSINESS VOLUME, AS WELL AS

HEIGHTENED CREDIT RISK AND REDUCED VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENTS. AN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT, AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY AFTER A DISRUPTION OR OTHERWISE,

MAY ALSO, AS WE DISCUSS IN RISK FACTORS ABOVE, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LOSS COSTS AND THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

FINANCIAL

MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COULD BE EXACERBATED BY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY IN MANY REGIONS OF THE WORLD. THIS CAN IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS EVEN IF WE DO NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THE REGION SUBJECT TO THE INSTABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, DUE TO GLOBALIZATION, INSTABILITY IN ONE REGION CAN SPREAD TO OTHER REGIONS WHERE WE DO BUSINESS. IN

EUROPE, UNCERTAINTY IN RECENT YEARS HAS INCLUDED THE INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT ISSUERS, THE POTENTIAL PARTIAL OR COMPLETE DISSOLUTION OF THE EUROZONE AND

ITS COMMON CURRENCY AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SUCH POTENTIAL EVENTS ON GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY. ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING THE UNITED

KINGDOM'S EXPECTED WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, MAY IMPACT THESE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RISKS. IN THE UNITED STATES, FUTURE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT MAY ALSO IMPACT

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NEW U.S. ADMINISTRATION MAY ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE U.S. FEDERAL BUDGET AND TAXES, THE NATIONAL DEBT, INTERNATIONAL TRADE, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND

REGULATION GENERALLY DIFFERENTLY THAN THE PRIOR U.S. ADMINISTRATION, ALL OF WHICH MAY CONTRIBUTE, POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY, TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY AND CREATE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY.

SEVERAL

OF THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND BELOW IDENTIFY RISKS THAT COULD RESULT FROM, OR BE EXACERBATED BY, FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION, AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN OR ECONOMIC

UNCERTAINTY. THESE INCLUDE RISKS DISCUSSED ABOVE RELATED TO OUR ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, AND THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES, REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS, OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND

THE IMPACT OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS," PARTICULARLY THE

"OUTLOOK" SECTION, FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE RISKS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR MATERIAL REALIZED OR UNREALIZED

LOSSES.

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY. FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 93% OF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES CAUSED BY INFLATION OR OTHER FACTORS (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS) AFFECT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS ON OUR FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND NEW FIXED MATURITY

INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING THOSE PURCHASED TO RE-INVEST MATURITIES FROM THE EXISTING PORTFOLIO), THEREBY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME, WHILE RISING INTEREST RATES REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE

OF EXISTING FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, THEREBY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR BOOK VALUE. DURING 2016, THE NET PRE-TAX UNREALIZED GAIN IN OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO DECREASED FROM $1.78 BILLION TO

$865 MILLION AS INTEREST RATES INCREASED. ANY FUTURE INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS) WOULD RESULT IN A FURTHER DECLINE IN THAT UNREALIZED GAIN POSITION OR IN AN

UNREALIZED LOSS, THEREBY ADVERSELY IMPACTING OUR BOOK VALUE. INTEREST RATES IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN AT VERY LOW LEVELS RELATIVE TO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT RATES MAY

REMAIN AT LOW LEVELS FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD. THE VALUE OF OUR FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MAY DEFAULT OR BECOME IMPAIRED DUE TO A

DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR PORTFOLIO, OR DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN INSURER THAT GUARANTEES AN ISSUER'S

PAYMENTS OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. SUCH DEFAULTS AND IMPAIRMENTS COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS COULD BE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT. RAPID CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OIL PRICES, COULD ALSO SUBJECT CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENTS TO A HIGHER RISK

OF DEFAULT.

OUR

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED, IN SUBSTANTIAL PART, IN OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL

BOND PORTFOLIO). NOTWITHSTANDING THE RELATIVELY LOW HISTORICAL RATES OF DEFAULT ON MANY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT WE TYPICALLY SEEK TO INVEST IN HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY SECURITIES

(INCLUDING THOSE WITH STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS SUCH AS BEING SECURED BY DEDICATED OR PLEDGED SOURCES OF REVENUE), OUR MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO COULD BE SUBJECT TO DEFAULT OR IMPAIRMENT. IN

PARTICULAR.



IN RECENT YEARS, MANY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER DEFICITS OR PROJECTED DEFICITS. THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THESE

DEFICITS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION OF OUR MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO. THESE DEFICITS MAY BE EXACERBATED BY THE IMPACT OF UNFUNDED PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS OR BY DECLINING MUNICIPAL TAX BASES AND REVENUES IN TIMES OF FINANCIAL STRESS.



SOME ISSUERS MAY BE UNWILLING TO INCREASE TAX RATES, OR TO REDUCE SPENDING, TO FUND INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THEIR MUNICIPAL BONDS, OR

MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET TO FUND SUCH PAYMENTS. THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD DEFAULTS MAY INCREASE IF SOME ISSUERS VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO DEFAULT, INSTEAD OF IMPLEMENTING DIFFICULT

FISCAL MEASURES, AND THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CONSEQUENCES (SUCH AS REDUCED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS) ARE LESS SEVERE THAN EXPECTED.



THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD DEFAULTS MAY ALSO INCREASE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN LEGISLATION THAT PERMIT STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL

SUBDIVISIONS TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION WHERE THEY WERE NOT PERMITTED BEFORE. IN ADDITION, THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION OF MUNICIPAL BONDS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THERE ARE JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS IN A BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER PROCEEDING THAT LESSEN THE VALUE OF STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, DEBTORS MAY CHALLENGE THE EFFECTIVENESS

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF

STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS THOUGHT TO BE PROVIDED BY MUNICIPAL SECURITIES BACKED BY A DEDICATED SOURCE OF REVENUE. THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION MAY ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THERE ARE JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS IN A BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER PROCEEDING THAT QUESTION THE PAYMENT PRIORITY OF MUNICIPAL BONDS.

APPROXIMATELY

30% OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO IS EXPECTED TO MATURE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS (THIS INCLUDES THE EARLY REDEMPTION OF BONDS, ASSUMING INTEREST RATES (INCLUDING CREDIT

SPREADS) DO NOT RISE SIGNIFICANTLY BY APPLICABLE CALL DATES). FOR A SCHEDULE OF THE CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF OUR FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO BY YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO." OF THAT MATURING PORTFOLIO, A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT

INCLUDES MUNICIPAL BONDS THAT HAVE BEEN PRE-REFUNDED WITH U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. AS A RESULT, EVEN IF OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, THE OVERALL

YIELD ON AND COMPOSITION OF OUR PORTFOLIO COULD BE MEANINGFULLY IMPACTED BY THE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR REINVESTMENT WITH THE PROCEEDS OF MATURED BONDS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YIELDS REMAIN LOW

WHEN WE REINVEST SUCH PROCEEDS, OUR FUTURE NET INVESTMENT INCOME WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC BONDS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE AT THE TIME OF RE-INVESTMENT, THE MIX

OF SPECIFIC ISSUERS IN OUR FIXED-INCOME AND MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO WILL CHANGE.

OUR

PORTFOLIO HAS BENEFITED FROM TAX EXEMPTIONS (SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO INTEREST FROM MUNICIPAL BONDS) AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE GOVERNING

DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH AS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). CHANGES IN THESE LAWS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. SEE "CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS OR IN THE

TAX LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US" BELOW.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES: RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS; PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY

SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES; COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; AND WHOLLY-OWNED REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUATIONS

AND/OR FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION.

WE

ALSO INVEST A PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN OTHER

TYPES OF NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS WITH EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE RISK, SUCH AS OIL. ALL OF THESE ASSET CLASSES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY IN THEIR INVESTMENT

RETURNS THAN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR NON-FIXED MATURITY

INVESTMENTS AND THE REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME, AND/OR RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY REALIZE REDUCED RETURNS ON THESE INVESTMENTS, INCUR LOSSES

ON SALES OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. FROM TIME TO TIME,

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS TO MANAGE THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, WHICH CAN RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASED VALUATION UNCERTAINTIES WHEN INVESTMENT MARKETS ARE ILLIQUID. THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE

ILLIQUID, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (I.E., THE CARRYING AMOUNT) OF THE PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AS REFLECTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF PRICES AT WHICH ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS COULD OCCUR.

GIVEN

THAT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN AND COULD BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, WE MAY, DEPENDING ON CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE FUTURE, MAKE CHANGES TO THE MIX OF INVESTMENTS IN OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THESE CHANGES MAY IMPACT THE DURATION, VOLATILITY AND RISK OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE REALIZED AND/OR

UNREALIZED

INVESTMENT LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY.

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BECAUSE OF OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

WITH REGARD

TO ASBESTOS

CLAIMS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS (INCLUDING OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY). FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS

INCLUDE CONTINUED INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS AND THE CONTINUED FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION. THE

FOCUS ON THESE DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. THE BANKRUPTCY OF MANY TRADITIONAL

DEFENDANTS HAS ALSO CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY

SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION

ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET. THIS TREND OF PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT

TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION, HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS WE EXPERIENCED.

WE

ALSO CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A

PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED

AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDER'S FAVOR

AND OUR OTHER DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF

ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN A MODERATION IN THE OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF

THESE CLAIMS.

FURTHER,

IN ADDITION TO CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO

THE HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS,

INCLUDING US, COULD BE MADE IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON

NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY.

WITH

REGARD TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR ALLEGED

DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARISE UNDER VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND

THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE

PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS MAY BE IMPOSED ON CERTAIN PARTIES EVEN IF THEY DID NOT CAUSE THE RELEASE OR

THREATENED RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SOME

COURT

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECISIONS

HAVE INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO

JURISDICTION.

UNCERTAINTIES

SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS AND RELATED

LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT

LIMITATION.



THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION;



A FURTHER INCREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE, AND/OR THE NUMBER OF, ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED;



THE EMERGENCE OF A GREATER NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS THAN ANTICIPATED AS A RESULT OF EXTENDED LIFE EXPECTANCIES RESULTING FROM MEDICAL ADVANCES

AND LIFESTYLE IMPROVEMENTS;



THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES WE HAVE ISSUED;



THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES CONCERNING COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS

ASSESSMENT OF THESE DISPUTES;



THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST US;



FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS;



ANY IMPACT ON ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WE INSURE DUE TO THE BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS;



THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH

THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS; AND



UNCERTAINTIES ARISING FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS.

IT

IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS

ENVIRONMENT COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION AND FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR

JUDICIAL REFORMS

ESTABLISHING MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A

LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE.

WHILE

THE ONGOING EVALUATION OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN

LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND

"ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS." ALSO SEE

"ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS."

THE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE, AND THE IMPACT OF INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE

OPERATE,

COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY.

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND

WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL REMAIN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INSURERS WHICH MAY

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OFFER

PRODUCTS AT PRICES AND ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ECONOMIC STANDARDS IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE THEIR BUSINESS. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD

ALSO BE IMPACTED BY CURRENT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS AVAILABLE TO US AS WELL AS TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN RECENT YEARS, PENSION AND HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHER

ENTITIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL AVAILABLE CAPITAL AND POTENTIALLY LOWER RETURN OBJECTIVES HAVE INCREASINGLY SOUGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES.

WELL-CAPITALIZED NEW ENTRANTS TO THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRIES, EXISTING COMPETITORS THAT RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL INFUSIONS OF CAPITAL, AS WELL AS COMPETITORS THAT CAN

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MORE FAVORABLE TAX DOMICILES THAN THE UNITED STATES, MAY CONDUCT BUSINESS IN WAYS THAT ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND PROFITABILITY. FURTHER, AN EXPANDED SUPPLY OF

REINSURANCE CAPITAL MAY LOWER COSTS FOR INSURERS THAT RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON REINSURANCE AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, THOSE INSURERS MAY BE ABLE TO PRICE THEIR PRODUCTS MORE COMPETITIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, INCLUDING CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, NOT ONLY IN PERSONAL LINES (WHERE WE CURRENTLY AND MAY

INCREASINGLY COMPETE AGAINST DIRECT WRITERS), BUT ALSO IN COMMERCIAL LINES (WHERE DIRECT WRITERS MAY BECOME A MORE SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF COMPETITION IN THE FUTURE, PARTICULARLY IN THE SMALL COMMERCIAL

MARKET). CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY ALSO COULD ALTER THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND/OR THE RATES OR TERMS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IN

PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE USE OF COMPARATIVE RATING TECHNOLOGIES HAS IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT, OUR BUSINESS AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE

COMPANY'S PERSONAL INSURANCE NEW BUSINESS IS WRITTEN AFTER AN AGENT COMPARES QUOTES USING COMPARATIVE RATING TECHNOLOGIES, A COST-EFFICIENT MEANS OF OBTAINING QUOTES FROM MULTIPLE COMPANIES. BECAUSE

THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, WHETHER BY AGENTS OR DIRECTLY BY CUSTOMERS, FACILITATES THE PROCESS OF GENERATING MULTIPLE QUOTES, THE TECHNOLOGY HAS INCREASED PRICE COMPARISON ON NEW BUSINESS AND,

INCREASINGLY, ON RENEWAL BUSINESS. IT ALSO HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF QUOTE ACTIVITY AND A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF QUOTES THAT RESULT IN NEW BUSINESS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND THESE TRENDS MAY

CONTINUE OR ACCELERATE. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OPERATE WITH A COMPETITIVE COST STRUCTURE OR ACCURATELY ESTIMATE AND PRICE FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, OUR BUSINESS VOLUME AND UNDERWRITING

MARGINS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OVER TIME. ADDITIONALLY, SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY IS STARTING TO BE USED TO ACCESS COMPARATIVE RATES FOR SMALL COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND THAT TREND MAY CONTINUE OR

ACCELERATE.

TECHNOLOGY

COMPANIES OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES HAVE CREATED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE CREATE, DIGITALLY-ENABLED ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THESE ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS MAY COMPETE WITH US DIRECTLY BY PROVIDING, OR ARRANGING TO PROVIDE, INSURANCE COVERAGE THEMSELVES. SEE ALSO

"DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US" BELOW.

OTHER

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY PRESENT COMPETITIVE RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, INNOVATIONS, SUCH AS TELEMATICS AND OTHER USAGE-BASED METHODS OF DETERMINING PREMIUMS, CAN IMPACT PRODUCT DESIGN

AND PRICING AND MAY BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTOR. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION COULD BE IMPACTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEPLOY, IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER, TECHNOLOGY THAT

COLLECTS AND ANALYZES A WIDE VARIETY OF DATA POINTS (SO-CALLED "BIG DATA" ANALYSIS) TO MAKE UNDERWRITING OR OTHER DECISIONS, OR IF OUR COMPETITORS COLLECT AND USE DATA WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY

TO ACCESS OR USE. SEE ALSO "OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY"

BELOW.

COMPETITIVE

DYNAMICS MAY IMPACT THE SUCCESS OF EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERWRITING MARGINS ON OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THESE EFFORTS COULD INCLUDE SEEKING IMPROVED RATES, AS WELL AS

IMPROVED TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND COULD ALSO INCLUDE OTHER INITIATIVES, SUCH AS REDUCING OPERATING EXPENSES AND ACQUISITION COSTS. THESE EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND/OR MAY RESULT IN LOWER

RETENTION AND NEW BUSINESS LEVELS AND THEREFORE LOWER BUSINESS VOLUMES. IN ADDITION, IF OUR UNDERWRITING IS NOT EFFECTIVE, FURTHER EFFORTS TO INCREASE RATES COULD ALSO LEAD TO "ADVERSE SELECTION",

WHEREBY ACCOUNTS RETAINED HAVE HIGHER LOSSES, AND ARE LESS PROFITABLE, THAN ACCOUNTS LOST. FOR MORE DETAIL, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOUTLOOK."

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SIMILAR TO OTHER INDUSTRIES, THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS UNDERGOING RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL AND OTHER CHANGE. TRADITIONAL INSURANCE INDUSTRY

PARTICIPANTS, TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, "INSURTECH" START-UP COMPANIES, THE NUMBER OF WHICH HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS, AND OTHERS ARE FOCUSED ON USING TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION TO

SIMPLIFY AND IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, INCREASE EFFICIENCIES, REDESIGN PRODUCTS, ALTER BUSINESS MODELS AND EFFECT OTHER POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE CHANGES IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. IF WE DO NOT

ANTICIPATE, KEEP PACE WITH AND ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL AND OTHER CHANGES IMPACTING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, IT COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE, DECREASE THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS, AND

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ALSO POSE RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS. FOR

EXAMPLE, TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS DRIVERLESS VEHICLES, ASSISTED-DRIVING TECHNOLOGIES, TECHNOLOGIES THAT FACILITATE RIDE OR HOME SHARING, SMART HOMES OR AUTOMATION COULD REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF

OUR PRODUCTS, CREATE COVERAGE ISSUES OR IMPACT THE FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY OF LOSSES, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY.

OVERALL,

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IN OUR VARIOUS BUSINESSES IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO OUR.



ABILITY TO PROFITABLY PRICE OUR BUSINESS, RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND OBTAIN NEW BUSINESS;



PREMIUMS CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED (INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED PROGRAMS);



AGENT, BROKER AND POLICYHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS;



ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS;



SPEED OF CLAIMS PAYMENT;



ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER;



ABILITY TO ADAPT TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS MODELS, TECHNOLOGY, CUSTOMER PREFERENCES OR REGULATION IMPACTING THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE;



PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CORRESPONDING RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES;



REPUTATION, EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES;



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS; AND



LOCAL PRESENCE.

WE

MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN CONTINUING TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON ANY OF THESE BASES IN THE FUTURE. IF COMPETITION OR TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER CHANGES TO THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE

LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING BUSINESS OR WRITE NEW BUSINESS AT ADEQUATE RATES OR ON APPROPRIATE TERMS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE "COMPETITION"

SECTIONS OF THE DISCUSSION ON BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN "ITEM 1BUSINESS."

DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US

.    WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS

PRIMARILY

THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN THROUGH LESS THAN A DOZEN SUCH INTERMEDIARIES. FURTHER, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND OF INCREASED CONSOLIDATION BY AGENTS

AND BROKERS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH, AND FEES PAID TO, SOME AGENTS AND BROKERS, AND/OR OTHERWISE NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PRICING OR DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. AGENTS AND BROKERS

MAY INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH US TO THE EXTENT THAT MARKETS INCREASINGLY PROVIDE THEM WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO PROVIDERS OF CAPITAL SEEKING EXPOSURE TO INSURANCE RISK. SEE ALSO "THE INTENSE COMPETITION

THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY." IN ALL OF THE FOREGOING SITUATIONS, LOSS

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF

ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDED THROUGH SUCH AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE

MAY ALSO SEEK TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, WHICH COULD DISRUPT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR AGENTS AND BROKERS. IN ADDITION, AGENTS AND BROKERS MAY CREATE ALTERNATE

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND PRICING. ACCESS TO GREATER LEVELS OF DATA AND INCREASED UTILIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY BY AGENTS AND

BROKERS MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, BROKERS INCREASINGLY HAVE BEEN PACKAGING PORTFOLIOS OF RISKS TOGETHER AND OFFERING THEM TO A

NARROWER RANGE OF CARRIERS AS WELL AS, IN SOME CASES, REQUESTING A COMMITMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PORTFOLIOS IN ADVANCE. OUR EFFORTS OR THEIR EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO NEW PRODUCTS OR ALTERNATE

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE WAY AGENTS AND BROKERS UTILIZE DATA AND TECHNOLOGY, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS WHO CURRENTLY

MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, RESULTING IN A LOWER VOLUME AND/OR PROFITABILITY OF BUSINESS GENERATED FROM THESE SOURCES.

WE

RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKETING AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY INCREASINGLY RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS AND TOLL-FREE NUMBERS FOR DISTRIBUTION. IN

SOME INSTANCES, OUR AGENTS AND BROKERS ARE REQUIRED TO ACCESS SEPARATE BUSINESS PLATFORMS TO EXECUTE THE SALE OF OUR PERSONAL INSURANCE OR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. SHOULD INTERNET DISRUPTIONS

OCCUR, OR FRUSTRATION WITH OUR BUSINESS PLATFORMS OR DISTRIBUTION INITIATIVES DEVELOP AMONG OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, ANY RESULTING LOSS OF BUSINESS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE "IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA SECURITY AND/OR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED" BELOW.

CUSTOMERS

IN THE PAST HAVE BROUGHT CLAIMS AGAINST US FOR THE ACTIONS OF OUR AGENTS. EVEN WITH PROPER CONTROLS IN PLACE, ACTUAL OR ALLEGED ERRORS OR INACCURACIES BY OUR AGENTS COULD

RESULT IN OUR INVOLVEMENT IN DISPUTES, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTIONS RELATED TO ACTIONS TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN BY OUR AGENTS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO, AND MAY FACE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING, MASS TORT CLAIMS SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR

SUBSTANCES.

IN ADDITION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO OTHER TYPES OF MASS TORT CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES, SUCH AS LEAD PAINT, SILICA AND WELDING ROD FUMES. ESTABLISHING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MASS TORT CLAIMS IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTIES

BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, DISPUTES CONCERNING MEDICAL CAUSATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DISEASES, GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION OF THE LAWSUITS ASSERTING THE

CLAIMS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE RISE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS WITHOUT UNDERLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN DISEASE RATES. MOREOVER, EVOLVING JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS TORT THEORIES AND DEFENSES, INCLUDING APPLICATION OF VARIOUS THEORIES OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF INSURANCE

COVERAGE TO THESE CLAIMS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE, AND SUCH CHANGE COULD BE MATERIAL. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

AS INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL, JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND

OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIM AND COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING BY EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OUR

UNDERWRITING INTENT, BY INCREASING THE NUMBER,

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SIZE

OR TYPES OF CLAIMS OR BY MANDATING CHANGES TO OUR UNDERWRITING PRACTICES. EXAMPLES OF EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED

TO.



JUDICIAL EXPANSION OF POLICY COVERAGE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW OR EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY;



PLAINTIFFS TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATING TO CLAIMS-HANDLING AND OTHER

PRACTICES;



CLAIMS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS, WHICH OFTEN PRESENT COMPLEX COVERAGE AND DAMAGE VALUATION QUESTIONS;



CLAIMS UNDER DIRECTORS' & OFFICERS' INSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO LOSSES FROM INVOLVEMENT IN FINANCIAL MARKET ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS

MORTGAGE OR FINANCIAL PRODUCT ORIGINATION, DISTRIBUTION, STRUCTURING OR SERVICING AND FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES; FAILED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; FRAUD; IMPROPER SALES PRACTICES; POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING

IRREGULARITIES; AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ISSUES;



CLAIMS RELATED TO DATA AND NETWORK SECURITY BREACHES, INFORMATION SYSTEM FAILURES OR CYBER-ATTACKS, INCLUDING CASES WHERE COVERAGE WAS NOT

INTENDED TO BE PROVIDED;



THE ASSERTION OF "PUBLIC NUISANCE" OR SIMILAR THEORIES OF LIABILITY, PURSUANT TO WHICH PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO RECOVER MONIES SPENT TO ADMINISTER

PUBLIC HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, ABATE HAZARDS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND/OR RECOVER DAMAGES PURPORTEDLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A "PUBLIC NUISANCE";



CLAIMS RELATED TO LIABILITY OR WORKERS' COMPENSATION ARISING OUT OF THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR PANDEMIC;



CLAIMS RELATING TO ABUSE BY AN EMPLOYEE OR A VOLUNTEER OF AN INSURED;



CLAIMS THAT LINK HEALTH ISSUES TO PARTICULAR CAUSES (FOR EXAMPLE, CUMULATIVE TRAUMATIC HEAD INJURY FROM SPORTS OR OTHER CAUSES), RESULTING IN

LIABILITY OR WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS;



CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT ONE OR MORE OF OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT ON PERSONS BELONGING TO A PROTECTED CLASS IN VIOLATION OF

THE LAW, INCLUDING THE FAIR HOUSING ACT;



CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF MODERN TECHNIQUES AND PRACTICES USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXTRACTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES, SUCH AS HYDRAULIC FRACTURING

OR WASTEWATER INJECTION;



CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF PERSONAL CARS, HOMES OR OTHER PROPERTY IN COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS RIDE OR HOME SHARING;



CLAIMS RELATING TO UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES OF CURRENT OR NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS MODELS OR PROCESSES, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF RELATED

BEHAVIORAL CHANGES; AND



CLAIMS RELATING TO POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, INCLUDING HIGHER FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS.

IN

SOME INSTANCES, THESE EMERGING ISSUES MAY NOT BECOME APPARENT FOR SOME TIME AFTER WE HAVE ISSUED THE AFFECTED INSURANCE POLICIES. AS A RESULT, THE FULL EXTENT OF LIABILITY UNDER OUR

INSURANCE POLICIES MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THE POLICIES ARE ISSUED.

IN

ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL PASSAGE OF NEW LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO EXPAND THE RIGHT TO SUE, TO REMOVE LIMITATIONS ON RECOVERY, TO DEEM BY STATUTE THE EXISTENCE OF A COVERED OCCURRENCE, TO

EXTEND THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OR OTHERWISE TO REPEAL OR WEAKEN TORT REFORMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

THE

EFFECTS OF THESE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL AND WE

ARE

EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO OUR STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS.

ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO US TO THE EXTENT OF THE CEDED REINSURANCE, WE REMAIN LIABLE AS

THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. AS A RESULT, CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT ELIMINATE OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR

ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS.

IN

THE PAST, CERTAIN REINSURERS HAVE CEASED WRITING BUSINESS AND ENTERED INTO RUNOFF. SOME OF OUR REINSURANCE CLAIMS MAY BE DISPUTED BY THE REINSURERS, AND WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE

PARTIAL OR NO PAYMENT. THIS IS A PARTICULAR RISK IN THE CASE OF CLAIMS THAT RELATE TO INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN

ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS

CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS ARE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SETTLE

CERTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE WE DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT

IS INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED CLAIM COST IS INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, AS WE RETAIN THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT.

SOME OF THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM WHICH WE HAVE PURCHASED STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS SUBSEQUENT TO THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE. IF IT IS

EXPECTED THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PAY, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF THE RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE IF, AND TO THE EXTENT, THE PURCHASED ANNUITIES ARE NOT COVERED BY

STATE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR TOP

REINSURANCE GROUPS BY REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE AND THE TOP FIVE GROUPS BY AMOUNT OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS PROVIDED, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES."

THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRICE AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY. THE AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE CAPACITY CAN BE

IMPACTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONS IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET, SUCH AS THE OCCURRENCE OF SIGNIFICANT REINSURED EVENTS. THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE COULD AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, RECENTLY HAVE BEEN PRESSURING THE U.S. TO REDUCE ITS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR U.S. CEDING COMPANIES TO

OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM REINSURERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHICH, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR U.S. COMPANIES, INCLUDING US, TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IN

SUCH REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL, AND/OR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY FAIL TO MAKE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, AND THUS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN OF OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN GUARANTEE OR INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH THIRD

PARTIES.

IN ADDITION TO EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES (DISCUSSED ABOVE), WE ARE

EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN SEVERAL OTHER AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK RELATING TO POLICYHOLDERS, INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

WE

ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN OUR SURETY INSURANCE OPERATIONS, WHERE WE GUARANTEE TO A THIRD PARTY THAT OUR CUSTOMER WILL SATISFY CERTAIN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (E.G., A

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT) OR

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN

FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING EXPOSURE TO LARGE CUSTOMERS WHO MAY HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO MULTIPLE THIRD PARTIES. IF OUR CUSTOMER DEFAULTS, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES AND NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THAT

CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, IT IS CUSTOMARY PRACTICE IN THE SURETY BUSINESS FOR MULTIPLE INSURERS TO PARTICIPATE AS CO-SURETIES ON LARGE SURETY BONDS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE CO-SURETY OBLIGATIONS

ARE TYPICALLY JOINT AND SEVERAL, IN WHICH CASE WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR CO-SURETIES.

IN

ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER CASUALTY INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE

CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE SETTLED CLAIM. WE ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, AND, AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK TO THE POLICYHOLDER.

MOREOVER, CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND/OR GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES (I.E., POLICIES IN WHICH PREMIUMS ARE ADJUSTED AFTER THE POLICY PERIOD

BASED ON THE ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER DURING THE POLICY PERIOD). RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADJUSTED PREMIUM IS GREATER

THAN THE ORIGINAL PREMIUM.

OUR

EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK THAT WE HAVE TO OUR INSUREDS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. TO REDUCE SUCH CREDIT RISK, WE REQUIRE CERTAIN INSUREDS TO POST COLLATERAL FOR SOME OR ALL OF

THESE OBLIGATIONS, OFTEN IN THE FORM OF PLEDGED SECURITIES SUCH AS MONEY MARKET FUNDS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY BANKS, SURETY BONDS OR CASH. IN CASES WHERE WE RECEIVE PLEDGED SECURITIES AND THE

INSUREDS ARE UNABLE TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON THE SECURITIES PLEDGED AND/OR THE RISK THAT OUR ACCESS TO THAT COLLATERAL MAY BE STAYED DURING AN INSURED'S

BANKRUPTCY. IN CASES WHERE WE RECEIVE LETTERS OF CREDIT FROM BANKS AND THE INSUREDS ARE UNABLE TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE BANKS THAT ISSUED THE LETTERS OF

CREDIT.

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHEN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE INSURANCE POLICIES FROM US THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE PREMIUMS RELATING TO THOSE POLICIES ARE OFTEN

PAID TO THE AGENTS AND BROKERS FOR PAYMENT TO US. IN MOST JURISDICTIONS, THE PREMIUMS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PAID TO US WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY US. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ASSUME A

DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS DUE FROM INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

TO

A LARGE DEGREE, THE CREDIT RISK WE FACE IS A FUNCTION OF THE ECONOMY; ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE A GREATER RISK IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE RISKS DISCUSSED ABOVE

THROUGH UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS, OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE, COLLATERAL OBTAINED MAY SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE LITTLE OR NO VALUE.

FURTHER, THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL PROTECTION WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN ON THE BUSINESS WE WRITE IN CERTAIN MARKETS HAS DECREASED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DECREASE, AS A RESULT OF COMPETITION. WE ARE

ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CERTAIN GUARANTEE OR INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH THIRD PARTIES. SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS A

RESULT, OUR EXPOSURE TO THE ABOVE CREDIT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED BY THE STATES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING LICENSING AND SUPERVISION, AND CHANGES IN REGULATION MAY REDUCE

OUR

PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

THESE REGULATORY SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS, AND NOT NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF

INSURERS, THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INVESTORS. FOR EXAMPLE, TO PROTECT POLICYHOLDERS WHOSE INSURANCE COMPANY BECOMES FINANCIALLY INSOLVENT, GUARANTY FUNDS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ALL 50 STATES TO

PAY THE COVERED CLAIMS OF POLICYHOLDERS IN THE EVENT OF AN INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURER, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE STATE LIMITS. THE FUNDING OF GUARANTY FUNDS IS PROVIDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST

REMAINING INSURERS IN THE MARKETPLACE. AS A RESULT, THE INSOLVENCY OF ONE OR MORE INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST US. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL STATES RESTRICT THE

TIMING AND/OR THE ABILITY OF AN INSURER TO DISCONTINUE WRITING A LINE OF BUSINESS OR TO CANCEL OR NON-RENEW CERTAIN POLICIES.

THESE

REGULATORY SYSTEMS ALSO ADDRESS AUTHORIZATION FOR LINES OF BUSINESS, STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS, LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS,

UNDERWRITING

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIMITATIONS,

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS, CHANGES IN CONTROL, PREMIUM RATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF AN INSURER'S BUSINESS INCLUDING,

MOST RECENTLY, CYBER-SECURITY.

THE

STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN UNDER CONTINUING SCRUTINY, AND SOME STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR INCREASE STATE AUTHORITY TO

REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES. FURTHER, THE NAIC AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY RE-EXAMINE EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON

MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

AS

PART OF THESE CHANGES, INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS WERE AMENDED TO REQUIRE INSURERS WHO ARE PART OF A HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM TO FILE AN ENTERPRISE RISK REPORT TO PROVIDE THE

LEAD INSURANCE REGULATOR WITH A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM) FRAMEWORK INCLUDING THE MATERIAL RISKS WITHIN THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM THAT COULD POSE RISK TO THE

INSURANCE ENTITIES WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. INSURERS HAVING PREMIUM VOLUME ABOVE CERTAIN THRESHOLDS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PERFORM AT LEAST ANNUALLY A SELF-ASSESSMENT

OF THEIR CURRENT AND FUTURE RISKS, INCLUDING THEIR LIKELY FUTURE SOLVENCY POSITION (KNOWN AS AN OWN RISK AND SOLVENCY ASSESSMENT OR ORSA) AND FILE A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT WITH THE INSURER'S LEAD

INSURANCE REGULATOR. THE REQUIREMENT FOR AN INSURER TO CONDUCT AN ORSA IS INTENDED TO FOSTER AN EFFECTIVE LEVEL OF ERM AT ALL INSURERS WITHIN A HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM, AND TO PROVIDE A GROUP-WIDE

PERSPECTIVE ON RISK AND CAPITAL AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE LEGAL ENTITY VIEW. ORSA IS NOW INCLUDED IN THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS (IAIS) STANDARDS AND IS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF

IMPLEMENTATION IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, CANADA, AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, AS A RESULT OF ORSA AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT MAY BE USED BY INSURANCE REGULATORS, OUR STATES OF

DOMICILE OR OTHER REGULATORY BODIES MAY REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR ERM PROCESS (E.G., PRESCRIBE THE USE OF SPECIFIC MODELS OR THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS IN THE COMPANY'S MODELS) THAT

HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO WRITE CERTAIN RISKS, LIMIT OUR RISK APPETITE TO WRITE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS OR REDUCE OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FLEXIBILITY. SEE "ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT" FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S ERM.

THE

NAIC AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS, AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE, ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE IAIS TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL COMMON FRAMEWORK (COMFRAME)

FOR THE SUPERVISION OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS (IAIGS). IF ADOPTED, COMFRAME WOULD REQUIRE THE DESIGNATION OF A GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISOR (REGULATOR) FOR EACH IAIG AND WOULD IMPOSE A GROUP

CAPITAL REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD BE APPLIED TO AN IAIG IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT LEGAL ENTITY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS. IN RESPONSE TO COMFRAME, THE NAIC DEVELOPED A

MODEL LAW THAT ALLOWS STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS IN THE U.S. TO BE DESIGNATED AS GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISORS FOR U.S. BASED IAIGS. ADDITIONALLY, THE NAIC IS DEVELOPING A GROUP CAPITAL ANALYTICAL TOOL THAT

WOULD BE APPLIED TO U.S. BASED INSURANCE GROUPS IN ADDITION TO THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC) REQUIREMENT THAT IS APPLIED ON A LEGAL ENTITY BASIS. THESE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS COULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT

OF CAPITAL THAT THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO HAVE AND COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY BEING SUBJECT TO INCREASED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

REGULATORS

MAY CHOOSE TO ADOPT MORE RESTRICTIVE INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDS TO THEIR

PARENT COMPANIES OR THEY COULD REJECT RATE INCREASES DUE TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS MAY ALSO INCREASE THE STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, STATE TAX LAWS THAT SPECIFICALLY IMPACT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES OR OTHER TAXES, COULD BE ENACTED OR CHANGED BY STATES TO RAISE REVENUES.

LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR HIGHER COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND THUS

A DOWNGRADE IN OUR CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INCREASE

OUR

BORROWING COSTS.

CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO AN INSURER'S COMPETITIVE POSITION. RATING AGENCIES PERIODICALLY REVIEW INSURERS'

RATINGS AND CHANGE THEIR RATINGS CRITERIA; THEREFORE, OUR CURRENT RATINGS MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES

BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE REDUCED, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE MANY CUSTOMERS MAY REQUIRE THAT WE MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATINGS TO ENTER INTO, MAINTAIN OR RENEW BUSINESS WITH US.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND WE MAY INCUR HIGHER BORROWING COSTS. IF SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RESULTING FROM ONE OR

MORE MAJOR CATASTROPHES, OR SIGNIFICANT RESERVE ADDITIONS OR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT LOSSES WERE TO CAUSE OUR CAPITAL POSITION TO DETERIORATE SIGNIFICANTLY, OR IF ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES

SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE (WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO AT A REASONABLE COST OR AT ALL, ESPECIALLY AT A TIME OF FINANCIAL

MARKET DISRUPTION) IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR LIMIT THE EXTENT OF A DOWNGRADE. A CONTINUED TREND OF MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHES OR A PROLONGED FINANCIAL MARKET

DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN MAY LEAD RATING AGENCIES TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. SEE ALSO "DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED." FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR RATINGS, SEE "ITEM 1BUSINESSRATINGS."

THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS, PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER

DIVIDENDS

OR MAKE FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES.

OUR HOLDING COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND

PRINCIPAL ON OUTSTANDING DEBT, TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN, TO PAY OTHER CORPORATE EXPENSES AND TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES. THE

ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THEIR STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS, EARNINGS AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE REGULATION AS AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. OUR U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. IN A TIME OF PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR OTHERWISE, INSURANCE REGULATORS MAY

CHOOSE TO FURTHER RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IS ALSO

RESTRICTED BY REGULATIONS THAT SET STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED.

THE

INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS COULD HARM

OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS, TO PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES.

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN TARGETED MARKETS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND MAY CREATE ENHANCED RISKS.

A NUMBER OF OUR

RECENT AND

PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES INVOLVE DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPANDING EXISTING PRODUCTS IN TARGETED MARKETS. THIS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING EFFORTS, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO PROTECT OR GROW MARKET

SHARE.



WE MAY DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT INSURE RISKS WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY INSURED, CONTAIN NEW COVERAGE OR COVERAGE TERMS OR CONTAIN DIFFERENT

COMMISSION TERMS.



WE MAY REFINE OUR UNDERWRITING PROCESSES.



WE MAY SEEK TO EXPAND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.



WE MAY FOCUS ON GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE HAVE HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE OR NO MARKET SHARE.

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE

MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPANDING IN TARGETED MARKETS AND, EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL, THESE EFFORTS MAY CREATE ENHANCED RISKS. AMONG OTHER

RISKS.



DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR IN NEW MARKETS MAY NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS.



TO THE EXTENT WE ARE ABLE TO MARKET NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN NEW MARKETS, OUR RISK EXPOSURES MAY CHANGE, AND THE DATA AND MODELS WE USE TO

MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES MAY NOT BE AS SOPHISTICATED OR EFFECTIVE AS THOSE WE USE IN EXISTING MARKETS OR WITH EXISTING PRODUCTS. THIS, IN TURN, COULD LEAD TO LOSSES IN EXCESS OF OUR EXPECTATIONS.



MODELS UNDERLYING AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DECISIONS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.



EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE OR INCREASE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CONFLICT, SUCH AS DESCRIBED ABOVE

UNDER "DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US."



IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS TO A NEW PRODUCT, SOME POLICYHOLDERS' PRICING MAY INCREASE, WHILE THE PRICING FOR

OTHER POLICYHOLDERS MAY DECREASE, THE NET IMPACT OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT RETENTION AND PROFIT MARGINS.



TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, WE MAY NEED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES, WHICH MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT

RESULTS IN THE NEAR TERM.

IF

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN TARGETED MARKETS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS PROVIDE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS.

THE

PROFITABILITY OF OUR

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS WE USE IN PRICING OUR POLICIES. WE UTILIZE PROPRIETARY AND

THIRD PARTY MODELS TO HELP US PRICE BUSINESS IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO BE CONSISTENT, OVER TIME, WITH ACTUAL RESULTS AND RETURN OBJECTIVES. WE INCORPORATE THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE, EXTERNAL INDUSTRY DATA AND ECONOMIC INDICES INTO OUR MODELING PROCESSES, AND WE USE VARIOUS METHODS, INCLUDING PREDICTIVE MODELING, FORECASTING AND SOPHISTICATED SIMULATION MODELING

TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE LOSS TRENDS AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE ALSO USE THESE MODELING PROCESSES, ANALYSES AND METHODS IN MAKING UNDERWRITING, PRICING AND REINSURANCE

DECISIONS AS PART OF MANAGING OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES AND OTHER EXTREME ADVERSE EVENTS. THESE MODELING PROCESSES INCORPORATE NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND FORECASTS ABOUT THE FUTURE LEVEL AND

VARIABILITY OF: FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES, INFLATION, INTEREST RATES AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AMONG OTHERS, THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO MAKE AND MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.

WHETHER

WE USE A PROPRIETARY OR THIRD PARTY MODEL, FUTURE EXPERIENCE MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM PAST AND CURRENT EXPERIENCE INCORPORATED IN A MODEL'S FORECASTS OR SIMULATIONS. THIS

INCLUDES THE LIKELIHOOD OF EVENTS OCCURRING OR CONTINUING OR THE CORRELATION AMONG EVENTS. THIRD PARTY MODELS MAY PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN WHAT OUR PROPRIETARY MODELING

PROCESSES PROVIDE. AS A RESULT, THIRD PARTY MODEL ESTIMATES OF LOSSES CAN BE, AND OFTEN HAVE BEEN, MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FOR SIMILAR EVENTS IN COMPARISON TO OUR PROPRIETARY ESTIMATES. THE DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THIRD PARTY MODEL ESTIMATES AND OUR PROPRIETARY ESTIMATES ARE DRIVEN BY THE USE OF DIFFERENT DATA SETS AS WELL AS DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND FORECASTS REGARDING THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF

EVENTS AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE EVENTS.

IF

WE FAIL TO APPROPRIATELY PRICE THE RISKS WE INSURE, OR FAIL TO CHANGE OUR PRICING MODELS TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT OUR CURRENT EXPERIENCE, OR IF OUR CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS MORE FREQUENT

OR SEVERE THAN OUR UNDERLYING RISK ASSUMPTIONS, OUR PROFIT MARGINS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE FREQUENCY AND/OR SEVERITY OF EXTREME ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRING, OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE RISKS WE ARE EXPOSED TO, WE MAY OVERPRICE OUR PRODUCTS, AND NEW

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS

GROWTH AND RETENTION OF OUR EXISTING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. AS WE EXPAND INTO DIFFERENT MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES, WE WILL WRITE MORE POLICIES IN MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS

WHERE WE HAVE LESS DATA SPECIFIC TO THESE NEW MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES, AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ERROR IN OUR MODELS AND STRATEGY. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING."

OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY.

WE DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS FOR CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND PROCESSING CLAIMS, AS WELL AS FOR PROVIDING THE DATA AND ANALYTICS WE

UTILIZE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS, AND THUS OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON MAINTAINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ENHANCE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS

THAT SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN A COST AND RESOURCE EFFICIENT MANNER. SOME SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR EXPENSE

RATIOS AS WE INVEST IN THE PROJECTS AND MAY COST MORE THAN WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE. IN ADDITION, SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY NOT DELIVER THE BENEFITS OR PERFORM AS EXPECTED, OR MAY BE REPLACED OR

BECOME OBSOLETE MORE QUICKLY THAN EXPECTED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, ADDITIONAL COSTS OR ACCELERATED RECOGNITION OF EXPENSES. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGE AND

UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, OR IF THE COSTS OF DOING SO ARE HIGHER THAN WE EXPECT, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE SERVICES TO, AND CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH, NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN A COST

EFFECTIVE MANNER AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA AND NETWORK SECURITY (INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF CYBER ATTACKS), OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OR CLOUD-BASED TECHNOLOGY, OUR ABILITY

TO

CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

WHILE TECHNOLOGY CAN STREAMLINE MANY BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE COST OF OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY

INITIATIVES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISKS. OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR EMPLOYEES' ABILITY TO PERFORM, IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. A SHUT-DOWN OF,

OR INABILITY TO ACCESS, ONE OR MORE OF OUR FACILITIES (INCLUDING OUR PRIMARY DATA PROCESSING FACILITY); A POWER OUTAGE; OR A FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR

OTHER SYSTEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SUCH FUNCTIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS, PARTICULARLY IF SUCH AN INTERRUPTION LASTS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE EVENT OF A COMPUTER

VIRUS OR DISASTER SUCH AS A NATURAL CATASTROPHE, TERRORIST ATTACK OR INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT, OUR SYSTEMS COULD BE INACCESSIBLE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OUR INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS INCREASINGLY INTERFACE WITH AND DEPEND ON THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING CLOUD-BASED, WE COULD EXPERIENCE SERVICE DENIALS OR FAILURES OF CONTROLS IF DEMAND

FOR OUR SERVICE EXCEEDS CAPACITY OR A THIRD-PARTY SYSTEM FAILS OR EXPERIENCES AN INTERRUPTION. BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS AND FAILURES OF CONTROLS COULD ALSO RESULT IF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS DO NOT

INTERFACE WITH EACH OTHER AS INTENDED. BUSINESS CONTINUITY CAN ALSO BE DISRUPTED BY AN EVENT, SUCH AS A PANDEMIC, THAT RENDERS LARGE NUMBERS OF A WORKFORCE UNABLE TO WORK AS NEEDED, PARTICULARLY AT

CRITICAL LOCATIONS; FOR EXAMPLE, OUR LARGEST LOCATION EMPLOYS ABOUT 20% OF OUR EMPLOYEES. IF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, SYSTEM FAILURE OR

SERVICE DENIAL, THIS COULD RESULT IN A DETERIORATION OF OUR ABILITY TO WRITE AND PROCESS NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS, PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE, PAY CLAIMS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR PERFORM OTHER NECESSARY

BUSINESS FUNCTIONS.

OUR

OPERATIONS RELY ON THE RELIABLE AND SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. COMPUTER VIRUSES, HACKERS

(INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS, ORGANIZATIONS OR ROGUE STATES) AND EMPLOYEE OR VENDOR MISCONDUCT, AND OTHER EXTERNAL HAZARDS, COULD EXPOSE OUR DATA SYSTEMS TO SECURITY BREACHES, CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER

DISRUPTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY E-MAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION

CAPABILITIES WITH THIRD-PARTY VENDORS AND OTHERS WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE SECURE

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAPABILITIES

WITH ALL OF SUCH VENDORS AND THIRD PARTIES AND, IN ADDITION, THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION.

LIKE

OTHER GLOBAL COMPANIES, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE REGULARLY SUBJECT TO AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE TARGET OF COMPUTER VIRUSES, MALWARE OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODES, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS,

CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER COMPUTER-RELATED PENETRATIONS. WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THREATS TO OUR DATA AND SYSTEMS, TO DATE, WE ARE NOT AWARE THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL CYBER-SECURITY BREACH.

HOWEVER, OVER TIME, THE SOPHISTICATION OF THESE THREATS CONTINUES TO INCREASE. OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL CONTROLS AS WELL AS OTHER PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CYBER

INCIDENTS AND PROTECT OUR INFORMATION MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO DETECT OR PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, OTHER PHYSICAL AND ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER SECURITY BREACHES TO OUR COMPUTER

SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD RESULT IN GREATER OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY MAY FURTHER EXPOSE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO THE RISK OF

CYBER-ATTACKS.

WE

HAVE OUTSOURCED CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES AND MAY INCREASINGLY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MONITOR

OUR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, IF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS DO NOT PERFORM AS ANTICIPATED, IF WE EXPERIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH A TRANSITION, OR IF OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS RELEVANT TO

OUR BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS ARE TERMINATED, WE MAY NOT REALIZE EXPECTED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS OR COST EFFICIENCIES AND MAY EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, INCREASED COSTS AND A LOSS OF

BUSINESS. OUR OUTSOURCING OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISK RELATED TO DATA SECURITY, SERVICE DISRUPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

OUR CONTROL SYSTEM, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES OR HARM TO OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. SEE ALSO "WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR CONTROLS DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE

WITH GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE." IN ADDITION TO RISKS CAUSED BY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE IMPACTED BY CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, UNANTICIPATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR PUBLIC POLICY INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

THE

INCREASED RISKS IDENTIFIED ABOVE COULD EXPOSE US TO DATA LOSS, DISRUPTION OF SERVICE, MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES, COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN

COMPLIANCE COSTS AND COSTS TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY AND RESILIENCY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. THE COMPROMISE OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD ALSO SUBJECT US TO LEGAL LIABILITY

OR REGULATORY ACTION UNDER EVOLVING CYBER-SECURITY, DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY LAWS AND REGULATIONS ENACTED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, CANADA, THE EUROPEAN UNION OR OTHER

JURISDICTIONS OR BY VARIOUS REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS OR EXCHANGES. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MIGHT BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS OR IN THE TAX LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US.

TAX LAWS MAY CHANGE

IN WAYS THAT

ADVERSELY IMPACT US. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED TO REDUCE THE EXISTING STATUTORY U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35%, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDINGLY, REDUCE ANY U.S.

DEFERRED TAX ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF ANY NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS VOLATILE AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES. THE EFFECT OF A REDUCTION IN A TAX RATE ON NET

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED, IN FULL, AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN ENACTED AND, ALONG WITH OTHER CHANGES IN THE TAX RULES THAT MAY

INCREASE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL TAX EXPENSE, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, A REDUCTION IN THE EXISTING STATUTORY U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE

COULD INCREASE THE AFTER-TAX EFFECT OF FUTURE SIGNIFICANT LOSS EVENTS AND OUR AFTER-TAX BORROWING COSTS.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS BENEFITED FROM CERTAIN TAX EXEMPTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE GOVERNING DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED

DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH AS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). FEDERAL AND/OR STATE TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED IN CONNECTION WITH

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFICIT

REDUCTION OR VARIOUS TYPES OF FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM THAT WOULD LESSEN OR ELIMINATE SOME OR ALL OF THE TAX ADVANTAGES CURRENTLY BENEFITING US AND THEREFORE COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, SUCH LEGISLATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PARTICULARLY CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF INTEREST FROM MUNICIPAL BONDS

(WHICH COMPRISE 45% OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016), WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF THOSE BONDS.

OTHER

TAX LAW CHANGES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, BUDGET CONSTRAINTS FACED BY MANY STATES AND LOCALITIES INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL RAISE REVENUE BY ENACTING LEGISLATION INCREASING THE TAXES PAID BY INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY FEDERAL TAX REFORM THAT IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE

U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE IN A "REVENUE NEUTRAL" MANNER COULD INCLUDE OTHER PROVISIONS THAT MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR TAXABLE INCOME OR OTHERWISE INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. FOR

EXAMPLE, POTENTIAL TAX REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES COULD INCLUDE A DESTINATION-BASED, BORDER-ADJUSTABLE CONSUMPTION TAX SYSTEM AND/OR TARIFFS THAT COULD IMPACT THE COST OF REINSURANCE AND/OR IMPORTED

MATERIALS WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR LOSS COSTS.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OUTSIDE

THE UNITED

STATES PRIMARILY IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. IN ADDITION, WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN BRAZIL, PRIMARILY THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE,

AND WE HAVE AN INDIRECT INTEREST IN A JOINT VENTURE IN COLOMBIA. WE MAY ALSO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND OTHER EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS

INDIA.

IN

CONDUCTING BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL RISKS, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS

PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE LIMITS, OWNERSHIP LIMITS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE OR ANTI-COMPETITIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS OR REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION. A PORTION OF OUR PREMIUMS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES IS GENERATED IN CANADA, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF WHICH CONSISTS OF AUTOMOBILE PREMIUMS FROM THE PROVINCE OF

ONTARIO, WHICH IS A HIGHLY REGULATED MARKET. OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY ALSO SUBJECT US TO CURRENCY RISK AND, IN SOME MARKETS, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE THAT

RISK, OR WE MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE THAT RISK. IN ADDITION, IN SOME MARKETS, WE MAY INVEST AS PART OF A JOINT VENTURE WITH A LOCAL COUNTERPARTY. BECAUSE OUR GOVERNANCE RIGHTS MAY BE LIMITED, WE MAY

NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE ABILITY OF THE JOINT VENTURE TO MAKE CERTAIN DECISIONS AND/OR MITIGATE RISKS IT FACES, AND SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS WITH A JOINT VENTURE COUNTERPARTY MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT

OUR INVESTMENT AND/OR REPUTATION. OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS RESULTING FROM THE NEED TO RECOGNIZE AND SUBSEQUENTLY REVISE A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE ASSOCIATED WITH INCOME TAXES IF WE BECAME UNABLE TO FULLY UTILIZE ANY DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS FROM THOSE FOREIGN OPERATIONS. ALSO, POLITICAL INSTABILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES, AND CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS AROUND THE GLOBE, COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN SUCH REGIONS.

OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND SIMILAR LAWS IN

OTHER COUNTRIES THAT PROHIBIT THE MAKING OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN OFFICIALS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POLICIES AND CONTROLS IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, IF THOSE

CONTROLS ARE INEFFECTIVE AND AN EMPLOYEE OR INTERMEDIARY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD SUFFER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND OUR BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SOME COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY EMERGING ECONOMIES, HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LACK CLARITY AND, EVEN WITH LOCAL EXPERTISE AND EFFECTIVE CONTROLS, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE

THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF, AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER, THE LOCAL LAWS. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING BRAZIL, PARTIES TO A JOINT VENTURE MAY, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, HAVE LIABILITY FOR SOME

OBLIGATIONS OF THE VENTURE,

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND

THAT LIABILITY MAY EXTEND BEYOND THE CAPITAL INVESTED. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT

NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESS IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY.

IN

ADDITION, COMPETITION FOR SKILLED EMPLOYEES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS AND OTHER NON-U.S. LOCATIONS MAY BE INTENSE. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HIRE, INTEGRATE, MOTIVATE AND RETAIN A SUFFICIENT

NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND NECESSARY FOR OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES, THOSE BUSINESSES AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

REGULATORY CHANGES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN CANADA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR

GROWTH.

INSURANCE LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND

MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR HIGHER COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND THUS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

IN

PARTICULAR, THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EXECUTIVE BODY, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, IMPLEMENTED NEW CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND RISK MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS CALLED SOLVENCY II ON JANUARY 1, 2016

THAT APPLY TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION. UNDER SOLVENCY II, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE U.S. PARENT OF A EUROPEAN UNION SUBSIDIARY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SOLVENCY II

REQUIREMENTS IF THE REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT THE SUBSIDIARY'S CAPITAL POSITION IS DEPENDENT ON THE PARENT COMPANY AND THE U.S. PARENT IS NOT ALREADY SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS DEEMED "EQUIVALENT" TO

SOLVENCY II. IN ADDITION, REGULATORS IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY HAS OPERATIONS ARE WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS (IAIS) (AND WITH THE NAIC, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE AND FIO IN THE U.S.) TO CONSIDER CHANGES TO INSURANCE COMPANY SUPERVISION, INCLUDING GROUP SUPERVISION AND GROUP CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE

IAIS HAS DEVELOPED A METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING "GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSURERS" (G-SIIS) AND HIGH LEVEL POLICY MEASURES THAT WILL APPLY TO THE G-SIIS. THE METHODOLOGY AND

MEASURES WERE ENDORSED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (FSB) CREATED BY THE G-20. USING THE IAIS METHODOLOGY, THE FSB, WORKING WITH NATIONAL AUTHORITIES AND THE IAIS, IDENTIFIED NINE INSURERS IN

NOVEMBER 2016 THAT THEY DESIGNATED AS G-SIIS. THE IAIS IS WORKING ON THE POLICY MEASURES WHICH INCLUDE HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ENHANCED SUPERVISION. THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS A

G-SII BY THE FSB; HOWEVER, THE FSB UPDATES THE LIST ANNUALLY, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE METHODOLOGIES COULD BE AMENDED OR INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE AND THE COMPANY COULD BE NAMED AS A

G-SII.

THE

IAIS IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR THE SUPERVISION OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS (COMFRAME). AS THE CURRENT DRAFT OF COMFRAME IS

COMPLETED, IT LIKELY WILL LEAD TO SIMILAR POLICY MEASURES AS THOSE BEING DEVELOPED FOR G-SIIS BEING MADE APPLICABLE TO INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS (OR "IAIGS"), INCLUDING GROUP

SUPERVISION, GROUP CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND RESOLUTION PLANNING, I.E., A WRITTEN PLAN DEVELOPED BY A FINANCIAL GROUP DETAILING HOW IT WOULD BE WOUND DOWN IN THE EVENT OF AN INSOLVENCY. THE

IAIS IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FIELD TESTING THE GROUP CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUP UNDER THE CURRENT CONSULTATION DRAFT. IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT COMFRAME, IF ADOPTED, COULD LEAD TO ENHANCED SUPERVISION AND HIGHER CAPITAL STANDARDS ON A GLOBAL BASIS IF THE IAIS, THE NAIC AND THE INDIVIDUAL STATES ADOPT THE PROPOSED OR SIMILAR

PROVISIONS.

WHILE

IT IS NOT YET KNOWN HOW OR IF THESE ACTIONS WILL IMPACT US, SUCH REGULATION COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS OF COMPLIANCE, INCREASED DISCLOSURE AND LESS FLEXIBILITY IN OUR CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOSS OF OR SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, SUCH AS CREDIT SCORING, OR OTHER DATA OR METHODOLOGIES, IN THE PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

OF

OUR PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

OUR UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO COMPETITIVELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AT A

LEVEL THAT WILL ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISKS ASSUMED. AS A RESULT, RISK SELECTION AND PRICING THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF ACTUARIALLY SOUND AND SEGMENTED UNDERWRITING CRITERIA IS CRITICAL.

HOWEVER, LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE FINDINGS, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL THE USE OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF UNDERWRITING CRITERIA. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY USE CREDIT SCORING AS A

FACTOR IN PRICING DECISIONS WHERE ALLOWED BY STATE LAW. SOME CONSUMER GROUPS AND/OR REGULATORS HAVE ALLEGED THAT THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING VIOLATES THE LAW BY DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PERSONS BELONGING

TO A PROTECTED CLASS AND ARE CALLING FOR THE PROHIBITION OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING. A VARIETY OF OTHER UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND OTHER DATA OR

METHODOLOGIES USED IN PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE CRITICIZED BY REGULATORS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CONSUMER GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS ON SIMILAR OR OTHER GROUNDS.

RESULTING REGULATORY ACTIONS OR LITIGATION COULD RESULT IN NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND/OR GENERATE ADVERSE RULES OR FINDINGS, SUCH AS CURTAILING THE USE OF IMPORTANT UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, OR OTHER DATA OR

METHODOLOGIES, EACH OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY RESULT IN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

FROM TIME

TO TIME WE MAY

INVESTIGATE AND PURSUE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES IF WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES AND THAT THE POTENTIAL REWARDS OF AN ACQUISITION JUSTIFY THE RISKS.

THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING AN ACQUIRED COMPANY OR BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, HOWEVER, AND MAY CREATE UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENDITURES. FOR EXAMPLE, ACQUISITIONS MAY PRESENT

SIGNIFICANT RISKS, INCLUDING.



THE POTENTIAL DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESS;



THE INEFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF, OR OTHER DIFFICULTIES WITH, UNDERWRITING, RISK MANAGEMENT, CLAIMS HANDLING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND

ACTUARIAL PRACTICES;



UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO AN ACQUIREE'S RESERVE ESTIMATES AND ITS DESIGN AND OPERATION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING;



THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO ACQUISITION INTEGRATION CHALLENGES;



THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES;



UNFORESEEN LIABILITIES;



DIFFICULTIES IN ACHIEVING THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN ACQUISITION, INCLUDING THE BUSINESS, FINANCIAL, TECHNOLOGICAL OR DISTRIBUTION

OBJECTIVES;



THE CULTURAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING EMPLOYEES; AND



THE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR CREDIT RATINGS.

ACQUIRED

BUSINESSES MAY NOT PERFORM AS PROJECTED, ANY COST SAVINGS AND OTHER SYNERGIES ANTICIPATED FROM THE ACQUISITION MAY NOT MATERIALIZE AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTEGRATION MAY

BE GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED. ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR DELAYS AND ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS MIGHT BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR CONTROLS DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS ARE NOT

EFFECTIVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE ON A DAILY BASIS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING, CLAIM PROCESSING AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX. THESE ACTIVITIES OFTEN ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNAL GUIDELINES AND POLICIES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM'S OBJECTIVES WILL

66

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BE

MET. IF OUR CONTROLS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, IT COULD LEAD TO FINANCIAL LOSS, UNANTICIPATED RISK EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK), ERRORS IN FINANCIAL REPORTING OR DAMAGE TO

OUR REPUTATION. SEE ALSO "IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA AND NETWORK SECURITY, OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OR CLOUD-BASED TECHNOLOGY, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED."

IN

ADDITION, INEFFECTIVE CONTROLS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY JOINT VENTURES OR RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, COULD LEAD TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION. THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND

AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR

SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT. SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES

.    THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM

WITHIN THE

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN KEY POSITIONS AND THOSE POSSESSING HIGHLY SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE IN AREAS

SUCH AS UNDERWRITING, DATA AND ANALYTICS, TECHNOLOGY AND E-COMMERCE. OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS, EFFORTS AND PROPER CONDUCT OF HIGHLY-SKILLED INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING OUR SENIOR

EXECUTIVES (MANY OF WHOM HAVE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY), AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGULARLY ENGAGES IN SUCCESSION DISCUSSIONS. SEE "ITEM 10DIRECTORS,

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE" FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, INCLUDING OUR SENIOR LEADERS. FOR MANY OF OUR SENIOR POSITIONS, WE

COMPETE FOR TALENT NOT JUST WITH INSURANCE OR FINANCIAL SERVICE COMPANIES, BUT WITH OTHER LARGE COMPANIES AND OTHER BUSINESSES. OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES AND TO

EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR

EMPLOYEES, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND REPUTATION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE OUR OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS FOR INFRINGING THE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF OTHERS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TRADEMARKS, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

SEE "ITEM 1OTHER INFORMATIONINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY." WE MAY NOT, HOWEVER, BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE AND DISCLOSURE BY OTHERS.

FURTHER, THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS MAY NOT PREVENT OUR COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING TRADEMARKS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS. MOREOVER, THE AGREEMENTS WE EXECUTE TO

PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE BREACHED, AND WE MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE REMEDIES IN RESPONSE. OUR ATTEMPTS TO PATENT OR REGISTER OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE U.S. AND

WORLDWIDE MAY NOT SUCCEED INITIALLY OR MAY LATER BE CHALLENGED BY THIRD PARTIES. FURTHER, THE LAWS OF CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS. WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE INITIATION OF EXPENSIVE AND PROTRACTED LITIGATION, AND WE MAY NOT PREVAIL. ANY

INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.

WE

MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES FROM TIME TO TIME THAT OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN RECENT YEARS, CERTAIN

ENTITIES HAVE ACQUIRED PATENTS IN ORDER TO ALLEGE CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT AGAINST COMPANIES, INCLUDING IN SOME CASES, US. ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US COULD CAUSE US

TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME AND MONEY TO DEFEND OURSELVES, REGARDLESS OF THE MERITS OF THE CLAIMS. IF WE ARE FOUND TO INFRINGE ANY THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, IT COULD RESULT IN

REPUTATIONAL HARM, PAYMENT OF SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES, PAYMENT OF LICENSE FEES (IF LICENSES ARE EVEN AVAILABLE TO US, ON REASONABLE TERMS OR OTHERWISE) AND/OR SUBSTANTIAL TIME AND EXPENSE TO

REDESIGN OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGIES TO AVOID THE INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WE USE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE IN SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND

TECHNOLOGIES.

IF ANY OF OUR SOFTWARE VENDORS OR LICENSORS ARE FACED WITH INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WE MAY LOSE OUR ABILITY TO USE SUCH SOFTWARE UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS RESOLVED. IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY

REDESIGN AN INFRINGING PRODUCT, SERVICE OR TECHNOLOGY (OR PROCURE A SUBSTITUTE VERSION), THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.

CHANGES IN FEDERAL REGULATION COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON US AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

THE DODD-FRANK WALL

STREET REFORM

AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2010 (THE DODD-FRANK ACT) ESTABLISHED A FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE (FIO) WITHIN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. THE FIO HAS LIMITED REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND IS

EMPOWERED TO GATHER DATA AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND INSURERS, BUT IT HAS IN THE PAST RECOMMENDED AN EXPANDED FEDERAL ROLE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. THE DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO GIVES

THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER A NUMBER OF NONBANK FINANCIAL SERVICES HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING INSURANCE COMPANIES, IF THEY ARE DESIGNATED BY A TWO-THIRDS VOTE OF A FINANCIAL

STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE FSOC) AS "SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS" (SIFI) OR OWN A BANK OR THRIFT. THE COMPANY, BASED UPON THE FSOC'S RULES AND INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE, HAS NOT

BEEN DESIGNATED AS A SIFI AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. NONETHELESS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FSOC MAY CHANGE ITS RULES OR INTERPRETATIONS IN THE FUTURE AND CONCLUDE THAT WE ARE

A SIFI. IF WE WERE DESIGNATED AS A SIFI, THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY COULD INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE HEIGHTENED FINANCIAL REGULATION AND COULD IMPACT REQUIREMENTS REGARDING OUR

CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE AS WELL AS OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT CONDUCT. THE DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO AUTHORIZES ASSESSMENTS TO PAY FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SIFI'S THAT HAVE BECOME INSOLVENT. WE (AS A

FINANCIAL COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN ASSETS) COULD BE ASSESSED, AND, ALTHOUGH ANY SUCH ASSESSMENT IS REQUIRED TO BE RISK WEIGHTED (I.E., RISKIER FIRMS PAY MORE), SUCH COSTS

COULD BE MATERIAL TO US AND ARE NOT CURRENTLY ESTIMABLE. AS A RESULT OF THE FOREGOING, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, INCLUDING ANY CHANGES THERETO AS A RESULT OF ITS CURRENT RE-EVALUATION OR OTHERWISE, OR OTHER

ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REGULATION THAT IS ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE, COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON US, INCLUDING IMPACTING THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, INCREASING COMPLIANCE COSTS AND

DUPLICATING STATE REGULATION, AND COULD RESULT IN A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE, PARTICULARLY RELATIVE TO OTHER COMPETITORS THAT MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LEVEL OF REGULATION.

EVEN

IF WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SECTOR REGULATORY REFORM, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON US. FOR EXAMPLE,

REGULATORY REFORM COULD HAVE AN UNEXPECTED IMPACT ON OUR RIGHTS AS A CREDITOR OR ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

OTHER

POTENTIAL CHANGES IN U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL REPEAL OF THE MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT (WHICH EXEMPTS INSURANCE FROM

MOST FEDERAL REGULATION) AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN FEDERAL TAXATION, COULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING US.

CHANGES TO EXISTING U.S. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPORTED RESULTS.

AS A U.S.-BASED SEC REGISTRANT, WE ARE

CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO

PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (U.S. GAAP), AS PROMULGATED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB), SUBJECT TO THE

ACCOUNTING RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). DURING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE SEC HAS BEEN EVALUATING WHETHER, WHEN AND HOW INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING

STANDARDS (IFRS) SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE U.S. FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEM, INCLUDING FOR COMPANIES SUCH AS US. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER WE WILL CHOOSE, OR BE REQUIRED, TO ADOPT IFRS

OR HOW THE ADOPTION OF IFRS (OR ANY FUTURE EFFORTS BY THE SEC TO CONVERGE U.S. GAAP AND IFRS) MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FUTURE. CHANGES IN U.S. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS,

PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT SPECIFICALLY APPLY TO PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY OPERATIONS, MAY IMPACT THE CONTENT AND PRESENTATION OF OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND COULD CAUSE INCREASED VOLATILITY IN REPORTED EARNINGS, RESULTING IN OTHER ADVERSE

IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY'S RATINGS AND COST OF CAPITAL, AND DECREASE THE UNDERSTANDABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AS WELL AS THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR REPORTED RESULTS WITH OTHER INSURERS.
