ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY

CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS

REPORT, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES

THERETO.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY

REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE

CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE.

OUR

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF

CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, INCLUDING

HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER AND FIRES.

CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO BE MAN-MADE, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE

INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS) OR A CONSEQUENCE

OF WAR OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR BUSINESS

SUBJECTS US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE FROM HURRICANES IN THE NORTHEAST, FLORIDA,

GULF COAST AND MID-ATLANTIC REGIONS, AS WELL AS CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE FROM

EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE NEW MADRID AND PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGIONS AND

OTHER WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.  THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES

ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, CHANGING CLIMACTIC

CONDITIONS HAVE ADDED TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND FREQUENCY OF NATURAL

DISASTERS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD AND CREATED ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS

TO FUTURE TRENDS AND EXPOSURES.  IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL AND MAN-MADE

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS WILL INCREASE.  IN

PARTICULAR, WE EXPECT THAT THE TREND OF INCREASED

SEVERITY

AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS EXPERIENCED

IN 2005 AND 2004 WILL CONTINUE INTO 2006.

THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL

AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY

OF THE EVENT. STATES HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME PASSED LEGISLATION THAT HAS THE

EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK, SUCH AS

LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS FROM WITHDRAWING FROM CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS.

IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE

INITIATIVES AND COURT DECISIONS WHICH SEEK TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR

CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE POLICIES.  ALSO, OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICING TO THE

EXTENT NECESSARY TO OFFSET RISING COSTS OF CATASTROPHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE

PERSONAL SEGMENT, REQUIRES APPROVAL OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN

STATES.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS FOR ANY FISCAL QUARTER OR YEAR AND MAY MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY OR HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS AND COULD IMPAIR OUR

ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.  ALSO, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE FREQUENCY

AND SEVERITY OF STORMS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, RATING AGENCIES MAY INCREASE

THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN

OUR RATINGS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RATINGS. IN ADDITION,

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS

COULD

CAUSE US TO EXHAUST OUR AVAILABLE REINSURANCE LIMITS

AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF

REINSURANCE

.  WE

HAVE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM, AND ALTHOUGH THE

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005 PROVIDES BENEFITS IN THE EVENT

OF CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM, IT MAY NOT BE EXTENDED BEYOND 2007 OR ITS

BENEFITS MAY BE REDUCED.

37

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BECAUSE OF

OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS

AND RELATED LITIGATION.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS

. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS

THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND

THE INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS.

AS A RESULT, WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS

CLAIMS BEING TENDERED TO US BY OUR POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING

COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY) INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST OUR POLICYHOLDERS BY

INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT APPEAR TO BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE.  FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS

INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS, THE FOCUS

BY PLAINTIFFS ON NEW AND PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS AND ENTITIES SEEKING

BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS A RESULT OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES.  IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL

NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE

ASBESTOS-RELATED

LOSSES BY INITIALLY DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY

ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING US.  BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS ARE ALSO CAUSING

INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN

BANKRUPTCY BUT THAT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM.

IN ADDITION, OUR ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE EXPERIENCE IS

IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER

INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE

INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS.

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS WHO HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, ACANDS, INC.,

WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR

ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE AS

DESCRIBED GENERALLY IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH. ALSO SEE PART I  ITEM 3  LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS. THESE TRENDS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN THE NEAR TERM.  AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE,

THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE FROM

ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

IN SOME

INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS CONTINUE TO ASSERT THAT THEIR CLAIMS FOR

ASBESTOS-RELATED INSURANCE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE AND

THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED AS A SEPARATE

OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY.  IT IS

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH

ISSUES OR WHETHER WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ASSERTING ADDITIONAL DEFENSES.  TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN

POLICYHOLDERS FAVOR AND OTHER ADDITIONAL COMPANY DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL,

OUR COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY

INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE

NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS.  ACCORDINGLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE

ULTIMATE COST OF THE CLAIMS FOR COVERAGE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS.

MANY COVERAGE

DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS.  BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS

MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF SETTLEMENT

NEGOTIATIONS.  SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING

BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO US

BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN ORIGINALLY

ANTICIPATED. ALSO, COURTS MAY NOT APPROVE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS

,

WHICH WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES

FOR US.  AS IN THE PAST, WE WILL CONTINUE

TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN ADDITION,

PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US,

CHALLENGING INSURERS CONDUCT IN RESPECT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS BY

INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY

INJURIES.

THERE

MAY BE ADDITIONAL FILINGS

OF OTHER

DIRECT ACTIONS

AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN THE FUTURE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN

THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

. WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM

POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF

THEIR ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO

VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE,

COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED,

ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION

WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS

FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES

AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION.

LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

WE HAVE BEEN,

AND CONTINUE TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES

PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. WE BELIEVE THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS HAVE

INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF

THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE

POLICIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY US PRIOR TO THE MID-1970S. THESE DECISIONS

CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING

SOUGHT BY THE CLAIMANT FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND WE DO NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE

MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY

AMOUNT.

38

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

. IT IS

DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS

AND

RELATED LITIGATION.

AS

A RESULT,

THESE

RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP.

THE CONTINUING

UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY

INHERENT IN

COMPLEX

LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM

THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER

ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS

, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHICH CANNOT NOW BE ANTICIPATED, THE

ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES

WE HAVE

ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES

PERTAINING TO THE

AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT

WITH

OUR PREVIOUS

ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS

, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST

US

AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO

OUR ABILITY TO

RECOVER REINSURANCE

FOR

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN ADDITION,

OUR ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE

EXPERIENCE

HAS BEEN

IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION

OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY

AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER

DEFENDANTS.

IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL

AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

THIS

DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS

WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION, INCLUDING PROPOSED LEGISLATION RELATED

TO ASBESTOS REFORM.

IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME OF LARGE COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR

COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT,

UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED.

THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE

CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE

NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE

EFFECTIVE.

SEE THE 

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

AND LITIGATION SECTIONS OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ALSO SEE PART I  ITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE,

ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT

RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

.  IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE.  THESE

ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT

NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

REINSURANCE MAY NOT PROTECT US AGAINST LOSSES.

WE

USE REINSURANCE TO HELP MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO PROPERTY AND CASUALTY RISKS. THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET

CONDITIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRICE AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY, WHICH CAN AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO US TO

THE EXTENT OF THE CEDED REINSURANCE, WE REMAIN LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON

ALL RISKS REINSURED. AS A RESULT, CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT

ELIMINATE OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT

RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS. IN

ADDITION, SOME OF OUR REINSURANCE CLAIMS MAY BE DISPUTED BY THE REINSURERS, AND

WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE PARTIAL OR NO PAYMENT. THIS IS A PARTICULAR RISK IN

THE CASE OF CLAIMS THAT RELATE TO INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO,

INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. REINSURANCE MAY

NOT PROTECT US AGAINST LOSSES AND MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO, AND MAY FACE ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING, MASS TORT CLAIMS SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES.

IN

ADDITION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO OTHER

TYPES OF MASS TORT CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY

HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING LEAD PAINT, SILICA AND WELDING ROD

FUMES.  ESTABLISHING CLAIM AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MASS TORT CLAIMS IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTIES

BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, DISPUTES

CONCERNING MEDICAL CAUSATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DISEASES,

GEOGRAPHICAL

CONCENTRATION OF THE LAWSUITS ASSERTING THE CLAIMS AND THE LARGE RISE IN THE

TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS WITHOUT UNDERLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS

SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN DISEASE RATES. MOREOVER, EVOLVING JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS TORT THEORIES AND

DEFENSES, INCLUDING APPLICATION OF VARIOUS THEORIES OF JOINT AND SEVERAL

LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THESE CLAIMS,

IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

BECAUSE OF

THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS

IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES.  IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE.  THESE ADDITIONAL

LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE

MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

39

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED

OUR LOSS RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF LOSS RESERVES ARE

NECESSARY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED

BUT NOT YET REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF

LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING

ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE.

THESE LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT

AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE,

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF

HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND

FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER

FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED

RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.

THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH

DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN

BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS

HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES,

AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS

AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE.

LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE

DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL

SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM

AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT

AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED

THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. WE CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A

REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL

CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. WE RIGOROUSLY ATTEMPT TO CONSIDER ALL

SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME LOSS RESERVES ARE

ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT ENVIRONMENT, FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT ANTICIPATED

AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN CURRENTLY RESERVEDFAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE.

THERE ARE ALSO RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE

ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE

AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY BY US AND OUR INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE

IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL

AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO

ESTABLISH THE RESERVES.  COMPLEX FACTORS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY

FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES;

ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE

IMPACT

OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE

EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY.  THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHES OCCURRENCE,

SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING

PERIOD.  THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO

CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH

ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT

RELATED RESERVES.  IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE.  THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES

IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND

COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR

OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

A PORTION OF OUR LOSS RESERVES ARE FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION WHICH AGGREGATED $4.79 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005. WHILE THE ONGOING STUDY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS

TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT

IN

COMPLEX

LITIGATION AND OTHER

UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN

LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT

THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN

FUTURE PERIODS. SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND MANAGEMENTS

40

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING

CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

AS INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL,

JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND

UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIM AND COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY EITHER EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OUR

UNDERWRITING INTENT OR BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF CLAIMS. EXAMPLES OF

EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE.



INCREASES IN THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF CLAIMS

RELATED TO EXPENSES FOR TESTING AND REMEDIATION OF MOLD CONDITIONS;



INCREASES IN THE

NUMBER AND SIZE OF CLAIMS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS, WHICH OFTEN PRESENT

COMPLEX COVERAGE AND DAMAGE VALUATION QUESTIONS;



ADVERSE CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS,

INCLUDING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN MEDICAL COSTS AND AUTO AND HOME REPAIR

COSTS;



JUDICIAL

EXPANSION OF POLICY COVERAGE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY; AND



A GROWING TREND

OF PLAINTIFFS TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATING TO CLAIM-HANDLING AND OTHER

PRACTICES.

THE EFFECTS

OF THESE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY

HARD TO PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS THE SUBJECT OF A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS BY

STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS OR THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

AS PART OF ONGOING, INDUSTRY-WIDE

INVESTIGATIONS, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING

FROM THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF NUMEROUS STATES, VARIOUS STATES INSURANCE AND

BUSINESS REGULATORS AND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE AREAS OF INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO US INCLUDE

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS, OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH NON-TRADITIONAL

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS, BRANDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SALVAGE

AUTOMOBILES AND THE REPORTING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION PREMIUMS.  WE AND OUR AFFILIATES MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL

SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE OR OTHER AREAS

FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR AUTHORITIES.

WE ARE COOPERATING WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION,

SEE PART I  ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

IT WOULD BE

PREMATURE TO REACH ANY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS OR

THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

POTENTIAL

OUTCOMES COULD INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS OR SETTLEMENTS RESULTING IN

FINES, PENALTIES AND/OR CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION

, THESE INVESTIGATIONS MAY RESULT IN

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL WHICH COULD,

IN TURN, ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED AND CHANGES IN REGULATION MAY REDUCE

OUR PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

WE ARE EXTENSIVELY REGULATED AND SUPERVISED IN THE

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING

LICENSING AND SUPERVISION BY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY AGENCIES IN SUCH

JURISDICTIONS.  THIS REGULATION IS

GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS, AND NOT

NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF INSURERS, THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER

INVESTORS.  THIS REGULATION ALSO RELATES

TO AUTHORIZATION FOR LINES OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS,

INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS, UNDERWRITING LIMITATIONS, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES,

DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS, CHANGES IN CONTROL, PREMIUM RATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER

FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF AN INSURERS BUSINESS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE STATE INSURANCE

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS COME UNDER INCREASED FEDERAL SCRUTINY, AND SOME STATE

LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR INCREASE STATE

AUTHORITY TO REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES.

FURTHER, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) AND STATE

INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY REEXAMINE EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY

FOCUSING ON MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OF

EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION,

CONGRESS AND SOME FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM TIME TO TIME INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT

CONDITION OF INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO

IMPOSE FEDERAL REGULATION OR TO ALLOW AN OPTIONAL FEDERAL INCORPORATION,

SIMILAR TO BANKS. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE EFFECT ANY PROPOSED OR

FUTURE LEGISLATION OR NAIC INITIATIVES MAY HAVE ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS.

INSURANCE LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE

RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT REQUIREMENTS OR MAY RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS.

41

ALTHOUGH THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DIRECTLY REGULATE THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, CHANGES IN

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES IN SEVERAL AREAS, INCLUDING

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION AND FEDERAL TAXATION, CAN

SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING US.

ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER SURCHARGES FOR GUARANTY FUNDS, SECOND-INJURY FUNDS,

CATASTROPHE FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY POOLING ARRANGEMENTS MAY REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY.

VIRTUALLY ALL STATES REQUIRE INSURERS LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS IN THEIR STATE TO

BEAR A PORTION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED BY SOME INSUREDS AS THE RESULT OF IMPAIRED

OR INSOLVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES. THESE ASSESSMENTS HAVE LEVELED OFF IN THE

RECENT YEAR AND IN CERTAIN STATES, HAVE BEGUN TO DECREASE.  THESE ASSESSMENTS MAY, HOWEVER, INCREASE IN

THE FUTURE IF ADDITIONAL INSOLVENCIES OCCUR.

MANY STATES ALSO HAVE LAWS THAT ESTABLISHED SECOND-INJURY FUNDS TO

PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO INJURED EMPLOYEES FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRIOR CONDITION

OR INJURY WHICH ARE FUNDED BY EITHER ASSESSMENTS BASED ON PAID LOSSES OR

PREMIUM SURCHARGE MECHANISMS. IN ADDITION, AS A CONDITION TO THE ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS STATES, OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES MUST PARTICIPATE

IN MANDATORY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY SHARED MARKET MECHANISMS OR POOLING ARRANGEMENTS,

WHICH PROVIDE VARIOUS TYPES OF INSURANCE COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER

ENTITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE THAT COVERAGE FROM PRIVATE

INSURERS. THE EFFECT OF THESE ASSESSMENTS AND MANDATORY SHARED-MARKET

MECHANISMS OR CHANGES IN THEM COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD OR LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.

A DOWNGRADE IN OUR CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS.

CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH

RATINGS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO AN INSURERS COMPETITIVE

POSITION.  RATING AGENCIES REVIEW THEIR

RATINGS PERIODICALLY, AND OUR CURRENT RATINGS MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED IN THE

FUTURE.  A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF

OUR RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, BECAUSE DEMAND FOR

CERTAIN

OF OUR

PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS MAY BE

REDUCED OR OUR RATINGS COULD FALL BELOW MINIMUM LEVELS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN

EXISTING BUSINESS.  ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY

FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HIGHER BORROWING COSTS

MAY BE INCURRED.  IF OUR CAPITAL POSITION

WERE TO DETERIORATE OR ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES WERE TO SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE

FUTURE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR LIMIT THE EXTENT OF A DOWNGRADE. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY OF WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHES IN THE LAST

TWO YEARS MAY LEAD RATING AGENCIES TO

SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASE THEIR

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

. THE RATINGS ARE NOT IN ANY WAY A

MEASURE OF PROTECTION OFFERED TO INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES AND SHOULD NOT BE

RELIED UPON WITH RESPECT TO MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES.  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR RATINGS,

SEE, ITEM 1 BUSINESS  RATINGS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR LOSSES WHICH COULD

REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OVERALL

PROFITABILITY.

ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FIXED

INCOME OR EQUITY MARKETS COULD IMPAIR OUR PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

CASH FLOWS.

FLUCTUATIONS

IN INTEREST RATES AFFECT OUR RETURNS ON, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF, FIXED INCOME

AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WHICH COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 93% OF THE MARKET

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.  IN ADDITION, DEFAULTS BY THIRD PARTIES,

PRIMARILY FROM INVESTMENTS IN LIQUID CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHO FAIL TO

PAY OR PERFORM ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OR RESULT IN INVESTMENT LOSSES.

WE INVEST A

PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IN EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER

VOLATILITY THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, STOCK

MARKET CONDITIONS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE

TIMING OF THE REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME. AS A RESULT OF THESE

FACTORS, WE MAY NOT REALIZE AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS, MAY INCUR

LOSSES ON SALES OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE

OF OUR INVESTMENTS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

THE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN

OR INCREASE OUR PROFITABILITY AND PREMIUM VOLUME.

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL REMAIN HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND

FOREIGN INSURERS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN WE DO. IN

ADDITION, SEVERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL LINES OF

BUSINESS NOW OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION, INCLUDING

LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE THAT UTILIZE

CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS. CONTINUED GROWTH IN

ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION COULD REDUCE OUR PREMIUM VOLUME. FOLLOWING

THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 AND AGAIN FOLLOWING THE HURRICANE

ACTIVITY IN 2004 AND 2005, A NUMBER OF NEW INSURERS AND REINSURERS WERE FORMED

TO COMPETE IN THE INDUSTRY, AND A NUMBER OF EXISTING MARKET PARTICIPANTS HAVE

RAISED NEW CAPITAL WHICH MAY ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO COMPETE.  FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NOW ABLE TO OFFER

SERVICES SIMILAR TO US AS A RESULT OF THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT, WHICH

REPEALED U.S. LAWS THAT SEPARATED COMMERCIAL BANKING, INVESTMENT BANKING

AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES.

42

OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING.



OUR

PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH,



RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING

AGENCIES,



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS,



AGENT, BROKER AND

CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS,



PREMIUMS

CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED

(INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED PROGRAMS),



SPEED OF CLAIMS PAYMENT,



REPUTATION, EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS

OF EMPLOYEES,



LOCAL PRESENCE AND



OUR ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO

COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

WE MAY HAVE

DIFFICULTY IN CONTINUING TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON ANY OF THESE BASES IN THE

FUTURE. IF COMPETITION LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS AT ADEQUATE

RATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  SEE ITEM 1  BUSINESS  COMPETITION.

THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN

SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY

FUTURE DIVIDENDS.

WE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY AND RELY IN PART ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON

OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND CORPORATE

EXPENSES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN

THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THEIR STATUTORY SURPLUS, EARNINGS AND REGULATORY

RESTRICTIONS.

WE AND OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY SOME STATES AS AN INSURANCE

HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. THIS REGULATION GENERALLY PROVIDES THAT TRANSACTIONS

BETWEEN COMPANIES WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM MUST BE FAIR AND EQUITABLE.

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS AMONG AFFILIATED COMPANIES, CERTAIN DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FROM

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN COMPANIES

WITHIN THE SYSTEM MAY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE TO, OR PRIOR APPROVAL BY, STATE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO

BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES.  THE ABILITY OF OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US ALSO IS RESTRICTED BY REGULATIONS

THAT SET STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED, THE NATURE OF

AND LIMITATION ON INVESTMENTS, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS TO

POLICYHOLDERS AND SHAREHOLDERS, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF REQUIRED PARTICIPATION

IN INSURANCE GUARANTY FUNDS AND THE INVOLUNTARY ASSUMPTION OF HARD-TO-PLACE OR

HIGH-RISK INSURANCE BUSINESS, PRIMARILY IN WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE

LINES.  THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DEBT

SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET

OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY FUTURE DIVIDENDS.

LOSS OR SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTION OF THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN THE

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING OF PERSONAL LINES PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE

PROFITABILITY

. IN

PERSONAL LINES, WE USE CREDIT SCORING AS A FACTOR IN PRICING DECISIONS WHERE

ALLOWED BY STATE LAW. SOME CONSUMER GROUPS AND REGULATORS HAVE QUESTIONED

WHETHER THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH

LOW INCOMES, MINORITY GROUPS AND THE ELDERLY AND ARE CALLING FOR THE

PROHIBITION OR RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN UNDERWRITING AND

PRICING. LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL THE USE OF CREDIT

SCORING, IF ENACTED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF STATES, COULD

REDUCE

OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR DISTRIBUTORS,

INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US

.  WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY

THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN THROUGH FEWER THAN A DOZEN

SUCH INTERMEDIARIES.  LOSS OF ALL OR A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDED THROUGH SUCH AGENTS AND BROKERS

COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY.
