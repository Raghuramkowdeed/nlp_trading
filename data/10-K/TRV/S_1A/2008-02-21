ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

THE NOTES THERETO.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE.

OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT

OF CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, INCLUDING HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER AND FIRES. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO BE

MAN-MADE, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS) OR A CONSEQUENCE OF WAR OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE GEOGRAPHIC

DISTRIBUTION OF OUR BUSINESS SUBJECTS US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES, WHICH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: HURRICANES IN THE NORTHEAST, FLORIDA, GULF COAST AND MID-ATLANTIC REGIONS;

TORNADOES IN THE MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST; EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA, THE NEW MADRID REGION AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA; AND WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. THE INCIDENCE

AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. IN RECENT YEARS, CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS HAVE ADDED TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND FREQUENCY OF NATURAL DISASTERS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, HURRICANES, TORNADOES, OTHER STORMS AND FIRES) IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD AND CREATED ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO FUTURE TRENDS AND EXPOSURES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE FREQUENCY

AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL AND MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS WILL INCREASE. ALTHOUGH THE TREND OF INCREASED SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS WAS NOT EVIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2007 AND

2006, WE BELIEVE THAT THE OVERALL TREND OF INCREASED SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS EXPERIENCED IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2005 AND 2004, AND EXPERIENCED IN THE CARIBBEAN DURING 2007, MAY CONTINUE IN

THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE

EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. STATES HAVE FROM TIME

TO TIME PASSED LEGISLATION, AND REGULATORS HAVE TAKEN ACTION, THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK, SUCH AS LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS FROM REDUCING

EXPOSURES OR WITHDRAWING FROM CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS OR MANDATING THAT INSURERS PARTICIPATE IN RESIDUAL MARKETS. IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES AND

COURT DECISIONS WHICH SEEK TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE POLICIES. ALSO, OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICING TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO OFFSET

RISING COSTS OF CATASTROPHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, REQUIRES APPROVAL OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN STATES. OUR ABILITY OR OUR WILLINGNESS TO MANAGE OUR CATASTROPHE

EXPOSURE BY RAISING PRICES, MODIFYING

UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCING EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND/OR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WE ALSO MAY

CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IN CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS THAT WE MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING OUR ACCESS TO OTHER UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES.

THERE

ARE ALSO RISKS THAT IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY TO

ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE

RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL

LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE; BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S

OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES

ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

47

CATASTROPHE

LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY FISCAL QUARTER OR YEAR AND MAY MATERIALLY HARM OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, WHICH IN TURN COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS AND COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES

OR FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE, RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RATINGS. IF OUR

RATINGS WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, THIS IN TURN, COULD HURT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD CAUSE US TO EXHAUST OUR AVAILABLE

REINSURANCE LIMITS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE. SUCH EVENTS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE CREDIT OF OUR REINSURERS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

COVERAGE, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCAPITAL RESOURCESCATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

COVERAGE." CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE CREDIT OF THE ISSUERS OF SECURITIES, SUCH AS STATES OR MUNICIPALITIES, IN WHOM WE HAVE INVESTED, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN

ADDITION TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, THE ACCUMULATION OF LOSSES FROM SMALLER WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER OR YEAR COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THOSE PERIODS.

GIVEN

THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN OUR OWN REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM,

PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY. ALTHOUGH THE

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 PROVIDES BENEFITS IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM, THOSE

BENEFITS ARE SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS. UNDER THIS LAW, ONCE OUR LOSSES EXCEED 20% OF OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PREMIUM FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR, THE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE US FOR 85% OF OUR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM WHICH EXCEED THIS DEDUCTIBLE UP TO A TOTAL INDUSTRY PROGRAM CAP OF $100 BILLION.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, OR MAN-MADE EVENTS SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING

NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS), COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY.

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED OUR LOSS RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF LOSS RESERVES ARE NECESSARY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND

ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEWS OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN

CLAIMS SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE,

SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS,

SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AND VARYING JUDGMENTS AND VIEWPOINTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS,

AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY

PRODUCT LINE DUE TO

48

DIFFERENCES

IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE

OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER).

WE

CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR, ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. INFORMED JUDGMENT IS

APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. DIFFERENT EXPERTS MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN

FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF FOCUS. HENCE, SUCH EXPERTS MAY AT TIMES PRODUCE ESTIMATES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH

OTHER. EXPERTS PROVIDING INPUT TO THE VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE ACTUARIES, UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE,

MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES.

WE

ATTEMPT TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME LOSS RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES, THE

FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WILL LIKELY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RELATED LOSS RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES

IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN IS CURRENTLY RESERVED.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM ONE INSURED EVENT, OR AN ACCUMULATION OF INSURED EVENTS, MAY EXCEED THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN

ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR

A DISCUSSION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES BY PRODUCT LINE, INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF COMMON FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT REQUIRED RESERVES, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES."

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BECAUSE OF OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT

DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN ASBESTOS

CLAIMS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM OUR POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY), INCLUDING CLAIMS

AGAINST OUR POLICYHOLDERS BY INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT APPEAR TO BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE. FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS

CLAIMANTS AND THE FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. THE FOCUS ON THESE DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT

BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES BY INITIALLY

DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING US. BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS HAVE ALSO CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS

AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT WHO REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL

EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN

INACTIVE DOCKET. THIS TREND OF PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON DEFENDANTS PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED PERIPHERAL, CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED. IN ADDITION, OUR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS

49

AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE EXPERIENCE IS IMPACTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR INSOLVENCY.

WE

CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A PORTION

OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED AS A

SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDER'S FAVOR AND OUR

OTHER DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE

NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDER. ACCORDINGLY, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

MANY

COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO US BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN ORIGINALLY

ANTICIPATED. THERE ALSO MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE A COURT MAY NOT APPROVE A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FOR US. AS IN THE PAST,

WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN

ADDITION TO CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO THE

HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. WE

ANTICIPATE THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE

TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE

LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE

GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY

REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

WE

HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. WE BELIEVE THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS HAVE INTERPRETED THE

INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY US PRIOR TO THE

MID-1980S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT BY

THE CLAIMANT FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND WE DO NOT TRACK THE MONETARY AMOUNTS BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR THESE CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION

BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY

PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY

UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES

50

WE

HAVE ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS

ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST US AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IT IS

ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY

FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION, INCLUDING LEGISLATION RELATED TO ASBESTOS REFORM. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF

LARGE COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE

CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE.

WHILE

THE ONGOING STUDY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED THEORIES OF

LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS

COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS." ALSO SEE

"ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS."

WE ARE EXPOSED TO, AND MAY FACE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING, MASS TORT CLAIMS SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR

SUBSTANCES.

IN ADDITION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO OTHER TYPES OF MASS TORT CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING LEAD PAINT, SILICA AND WELDING ROD FUMES. ESTABLISHING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MASS TORT CLAIMS IS SUBJECT TO

UNCERTAINTIES BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, DISPUTES CONCERNING MEDICAL CAUSATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DISEASES, GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION OF THE LAWSUITS

ASSERTING THE CLAIMS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE RISE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS WITHOUT UNDERLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN DISEASE RATES. MOREOVER, EVOLVING

JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS TORT THEORIES AND DEFENSES, INCLUDING APPLICATION OF VARIOUS THEORIES OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF

INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THESE CLAIMS, IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

AS INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL, JUDICIAL,

SOCIAL AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIM AND COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY EITHER EXTENDING COVERAGE

BEYOND OUR UNDERWRITING INTENT OR BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF CLAIMS. EXAMPLES OF EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.



ADVERSE

CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS, INCLUDING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN MEDICAL COSTS AND AUTO AND HOME REPAIR COSTS;



JUDICIAL

EXPANSION OF POLICY COVERAGE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY;



PLAINTIFFS

TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATING TO CLAIMS-HANDLING AND OTHER PRACTICES;

51



INCREASES

IN THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF CLAIMS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS, WHICH OFTEN PRESENT COMPLEX COVERAGE AND DAMAGE VALUATION QUESTIONS;



CLAIMS

FROM DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE RELATING TO POLICYHOLDERS' LOSSES FROM INVOLVEMENT IN FINANCIAL MARKET ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MORTGAGE OR FINANCIAL PRODUCT

ORIGINATION, DISTRIBUTION OR STRUCTURING, POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES, AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ISSUES;



THE

ASSERTION OF "PUBLIC NUISANCE" THEORIES OF LIABILITY, PURSUANT TO WHICH PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO RECOVER MONIES SPENT TO ADMINISTER PUBLIC HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS AND/OR TO ABATE

HAZARDS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY; AND



MEDICAL

DEVELOPMENTS THAT LINK HEALTH ISSUES TO PARTICULAR CAUSES, RESULTING IN LIABILITY CLAIMS.

IN

SOME INSTANCES, THESE EMERGING ISSUES MAY NOT BECOME APPARENT FOR SOME TIME AFTER WE HAVE ISSUED THE AFFECTED INSURANCE POLICIES. AS A RESULT, THE FULL EXTENT OF LIABILITY UNDER OUR

INSURANCE POLICIES MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THE POLICIES ARE ISSUED.

THE

EFFECTS OF THESE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

RATES OR AT ALL.

WE USE REINSURANCE TO HELP MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO PROPERTY AND CASUALTY RISKS. THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING

MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRICE AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY, WHICH CAN AFFECT OUR BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO US TO THE EXTENT OF THE CEDED

REINSURANCE, WE REMAIN LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. AS A RESULT, CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT ELIMINATE OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS. IN THE PAST, CERTAIN REINSURERS HAVE CEASED WRITING BUSINESS AND ENTERED INTO RUNOFF. SOME OF OUR REINSURANCE CLAIMS MAY

BE DISPUTED BY THE REINSURERS, AND WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE PARTIAL OR NO PAYMENT. THIS IS A PARTICULAR RISK IN THE CASE OF CLAIMS THAT RELATE TO INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO, INCLUDING

THOSE RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A

REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT

AUTHORITY. THE ABILITY OF REINSURERS TO TRANSFER THEIR RISKS TO OTHER, LESS CREDITWORTHY REINSURERS IMPACTS OUR RISK OF COLLECTING AMOUNTS DUE TO US. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL

AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL, AND THUS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR PROFITABILITY AND PREMIUM VOLUME.

THE

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL REMAIN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INSURERS,

SOME OF WHICH HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN WE DO. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS NOW OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK

PROTECTION, INCLUDING LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE THAT UTILIZE CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS. CONTINUED GROWTH IN ALTERNATIVE

FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION COULD REDUCE OUR PREMIUM VOLUME. FOLLOWING THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 AND AGAIN FOLLOWING THE HURRICANE ACTIVITY IN 2005 AND 2004, A NUMBER OF NEW

INSURERS AND REINSURERS WERE FORMED TO COMPETE IN THE INDUSTRY, AND A NUMBER OF EXISTING MARKET PARTICIPANTS RAISED NEW CAPITAL TO ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO COMPETE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PROPERTY

CASUALTY MARKET CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE IN 2008, PARTICULARLY FOR NEW BUSINESS. SEE "ITEM 7- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATION-OUTLOOK".

52

OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO.



OUR

ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS, TO OBTAIN NEW BUSINESS AND TO PROFITABLY PRICE OUR BUSINESS;



AGENT,

BROKER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS;



SPEED

OF CLAIMS PAYMENT;



PREMIUMS

CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED (INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED PROGRAMS);



OUR

PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CORRESPONDING RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES;



REPUTATION,

EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES;



GEOGRAPHIC

SCOPE OF BUSINESS;



LOCAL

PRESENCE; AND



OUR

ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

WE

MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN CONTINUING TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON ANY OF THESE BASES IN THE FUTURE. IF COMPETITION LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING BUSINESS OR WRITE NEW BUSINESS AT

ADEQUATE RATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE "ITEM 1BUSINESSCOMPETITION."

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT

RISK IN SEVERAL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK RELATING TO REINSURANCE, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, AS WELL AS CREDIT RISK RELATED TO POLICYHOLDERS IN CERTAIN LINES OF INSURANCE AND

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

A

PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE

CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. WE ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT AND, AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK TO THE POLICYHOLDER. MOREOVER,

CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICIES, I.E., POLICIES IN WHICH PREMIUMS ARE ADJUSTED AFTER THE POLICY PERIOD BASED ON THE ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE OF

THE POLICYHOLDER DURING THE POLICY PERIOD. RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADJUSTED PREMIUM IS GREATER THAN THE ORIGINAL PREMIUM. IN ADDITION

TO WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE, OTHER LINES OF INSURANCE ALSO EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK, SUCH AS SURETY INSURANCE WHERE WE GUARANTEE TO A THIRD PARTY THAT OUR POLICYHOLDER WILL SATISFY CERTAIN

PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (E.G., A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT).

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHEN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE INSURANCE POLICIES FROM US THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE PREMIUMS RELATING TO THOSE POLICIES ARE OFTEN

PAID TO THE AGENTS AND BROKERS FOR PAYMENT TO US. IN MOST JURISDICTIONS, THE PREMIUMS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PAID TO US WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY US. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ASSUME A

DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS DUE FROM INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

THE

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MAY BECOME IMPAIRED DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF ONE OR MORE ISSUERS OF

THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR PORTFOLIO, OR DUE TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE CREDIT RATINGS OF AN INSURER THAT GUARANTEES AN ISSUER'S PAYMENTS OF SUCH INVESTMENTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, DEFAULTS BY THE

ISSUER AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, ITS GUARANTOR, OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS THAT RESULT IN THE FAILURE OF SUCH PARTIES TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS WITH REGARD TO ANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS COULD REDUCE OUR NET

INVESTMENT INCOME AND NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OR RESULT IN INVESTMENT LOSSES.

WHILE

WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THESE RISKS THROUGH UNDERWRITING AND INVESTMENT GUIDELINES, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS, OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. TO A

LARGE DEGREE, THE CREDIT RISK WE FACE IS A FUNCTION OF THE ECONOMY; ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE A GREATER RISK IN AN ECONOMIC

53

DOWNTURN

OR RECESSION. AS A RESULT, OUR EXPOSURE TO ANY OF THE ABOVE CREDIT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND WE ARE THE SUBJECT OF A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS BY STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME

OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS OR THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

AS PART OF ONGOING, INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS, WE HAVE

RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING FROM THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF NUMEROUS STATES, VARIOUS STATES' INSURANCE AND BUSINESS

REGULATORS AND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE AREAS OF PENDING INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO US INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS AND OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH

"NON-TRADITIONAL" INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS. WE MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE OR OTHER AREAS FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

OR AUTHORITIES. WE ARE COOPERATING WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE "ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS".

IT

WOULD BE PREMATURE TO REACH ANY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS OR THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. POTENTIAL OUTCOMES COULD INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT

PROCEEDINGS OR SETTLEMENTS RESULTING IN FINES, PENALTIES AND/OR CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THESE INVESTIGATIONS

MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL WHICH COULD, IN TURN, ALSO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED AND CHANGES IN REGULATION MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

WE ARE

EXTENSIVELY REGULATED AND SUPERVISED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING LICENSING AND SUPERVISION BY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY AGENCIES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS. THIS REGULATORY

SYSTEM IS GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS, AND NOT NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF INSURERS, THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INVESTORS. THIS REGULATORY SYSTEM ALSO ADDRESSES

AUTHORIZATION FOR LINES OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS, LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, UNDERWRITING LIMITATIONS, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, DIVIDEND

LIMITATIONS, CHANGES IN CONTROL, PREMIUM RATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF AN INSURER'S BUSINESS.

IN

RECENT YEARS, THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS COME UNDER INCREASED FEDERAL SCRUTINY, AND SOME STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR

INCREASE STATE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES. FURTHER, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY

REEXAMINE EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN

ADDITION, CONGRESS AND SOME FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM TIME TO TIME INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT CONDITION OF INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO IMPOSE FEDERAL OR NATIONAL

REGULATION OR TO ALLOW AN OPTIONAL FEDERAL CHARTER, SIMILAR TO THE OPTION AVAILABLE TO MOST BANKS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE EFFECT ANY PROPOSED OR FUTURE LEGISLATION OR NAIC INITIATIVES MAY HAVE ON THE

CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS.

ALTHOUGH

THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DIRECTLY REGULATE THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, CHANGES IN FEDERAL LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES IN SEVERAL

AREAS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION (E.G., THE REPEAL OF THE MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT) AND FEDERAL TAXATION, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING US.

INSURANCE

LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR HIGHER COSTS AND THUS COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

A DOWNGRADE IN OUR CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL

MARKETS AND INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS.

CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO AN INSURER'S COMPETITIVE POSITION.

RATING AGENCIES REVIEW THEIR RATINGS PERIODICALLY, AND OUR CURRENT

54

RATINGS

MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS MAY

BE REDUCED OR OUR RATINGS COULD FALL BELOW MINIMUM LEVELS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN EXISTING BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND WE MAY INCUR HIGHER

BORROWING COSTS. IF SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, SUCH AS THOSE RESULTING FROM ONE OR MORE MAJOR CATASTROPHES, OR SIGNIFICANT RESERVE ADDITIONS WERE TO CAUSE OUR CAPITAL POSITION TO DETERIORATE SIGNIFICANTLY,

OR IF ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR LIMIT THE EXTENT OF A

DOWNGRADE. FOR EXAMPLE, A CONTINUED TREND OF MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHES MAY LEAD RATING AGENCIES TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE RATINGS ARE NOT IN

ANY WAY A MEASURE OF PROTECTION OFFERED TO INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON WITH RESPECT TO MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR RATINGS,

SEE, "ITEM 1BUSINESSRATINGS".

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR LOSSES.

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OVERALL

PROFITABILITY. ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES OR IN THE FIXED INCOME, REAL ESTATE, EQUITY OR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT MARKETS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

CHANGES

IN THE GENERAL INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AFFECT OUR RETURNS ON, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF, OUR FIXED INCOME AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WHICH COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY

94% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW INVESTMENTS, THEREBY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR NET

INVESTMENT INCOME. CONVERSELY, RISING INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, DEFAULTS UNDER, OR IMPAIRMENTS OF, ANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS AS A RESULT

OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE ISSUER AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, ITS GUARANTOR OF THE INVESTMENT COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OR RESULT IN INVESTMENT LOSSES.

WE

INVEST A PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, AND TRADING

SECURITIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE VALUE OF OUR NON-FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS AND THE REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY NOT REALIZE AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS, WE MAY

INCUR LOSSES ON SALES OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OR RESULT IN

INVESTMENT LOSSES.

THE

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CAN BE SUBJECT TO VALUATION UNCERTAINTIES WHEN THE INVESTMENT MARKETS ARE DISLOCATED. THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN THE

MARKETS ARE ILLIQUID AND MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (I.E., THE CARRYING AMOUNT) OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF PRICES AT WHICH ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS

WOULD OCCUR.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, IN TAX-EXEMPT OBLIGATIONS. OUR PORTFOLIO HAS ALSO BENEFITED FROM CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED

TO, THOSE GOVERNING DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH AS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). FEDERAL AND/OR STATE TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED THAT WOULD LESSEN OR ELIMINATE SOME OR ALL OF THE

TAX ADVANTAGES CURRENTLY BENEFITING US AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THIS RESULT COULD OCCUR IN THE CONTEXT OF DEFICIT REDUCTION OR VARIOUS TYPES OF FUNDAMENTAL TAX

REFORM.

THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO

PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS.

OUR HOLDING COMPANY RELIES IN PART ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST

AND PRINCIPAL ON OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND CORPORATE EXPENSES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON

THEIR STATUTORY SURPLUS, EARNINGS AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

55

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY SOME STATES AS AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY

IS ALSO RESTRICTED BY REGULATIONS THAT SET STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATION ON INVESTMENTS, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS TO

POLICYHOLDERS AND SHAREHOLDERS, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF REQUIRED PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE GUARANTY FUNDS AND THE INVOLUNTARY ASSUMPTION OF HARD-TO-PLACE OR

HIGH-RISK INSURANCE BUSINESS, PRIMARILY IN WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE LINES. THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN AN AMOUNT

SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS.

DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE

PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN THROUGH LESS THAN A DOZEN SUCH INTERMEDIARIES. LOSS OF ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE

BUSINESS PROVIDED THROUGH SUCH AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE

RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKETING AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY INCREASINGLY RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS AND TOLL-FREE NUMBERS FOR

DISTRIBUTION. IN SOME INSTANCES, OUR AGENTS AND BROKERS ARE REQUIRED TO ACCESS SEPARATE BUSINESS PLATFORMS TO EXECUTE THE SALE OF OUR PERSONAL INSURANCE OR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. SHOULD

INTERNET DISRUPTIONS OCCUR, OR FRUSTRATION WITH OUR BUSINESS PLATFORMS OR DISTRIBUTION INITIATIVES DEVELOP AMONG OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE RESULTING LOSS OF BUSINESS COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND IRELAND. WE HAVE ALSO STARTED TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING IN EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS INDIA AND CHINA. WHILE OUR

BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES CURRENTLY CONSTITUTES A RELATIVELY SMALL PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, IN CONDUCTING SUCH BUSINESS WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS, PARTICULARLY IN

EMERGING ECONOMIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, SOME COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY EMERGING ECONOMIES, HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LACK CLARITY AND, EVEN WITH LOCAL EXPERTISE AND EFFECTIVE CONTROLS, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO

DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF THE LOCAL LAWS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET COULD

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESS IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY.

WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR CONTROLS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS ARE NOT

EFFECTIVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE ON A DAILY BASIS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING, CLAIM PROCESSING AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX. THESE ACTIVITIES OFTEN ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNAL GUIDELINES AND POLICIES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. IF OUR CONTROLS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, IT COULD LEAD TO FINANCIAL LOSS, UNANTICIPATED RISK

EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK) OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY; CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT MULTIYEAR STRATEGIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS ARE CURRENTLY IN PROCESS BUT MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

WE DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON

OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS FOR CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND PROCESSING CLAIMS, AND THUS OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON MAINTAINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND

56

ON

CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ENHANCE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN A COST AND RESOURCE EFFICIENT MANNER. SOME SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE

LONG-TERM IN NATURE AND MAY COST MORE THAN WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE AND MAY NOT DELIVER THE BENEFITS WE EXPECT ONCE THEY ARE COMPLETE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGE AND

UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, OR IF THE COSTS OF DOING SO ARE HIGHER THAN WE EXPECT, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE SERVICES TO NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER AND OUR

ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA SECURITY AND/OR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

WHILE TECHNOLOGY CAN STREAMLINE MANY BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE COST OF OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES PRESENT CERTAIN RISKS. OUR

BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR EMPLOYEES' ABILITY TO PERFORM, IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS INTERNET SUPPORT AND 24-HOUR CALL

CENTERS PROCESSING NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS, AND PROCESSING AND PAYING CLAIMS. A SHUT-DOWN OF, OR INABILITY TO, ACCESS ONE OR MORE OF OUR FACILITIES, A POWER OUTAGE OR A FAILURE OF ONE OR

MORE OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SUCH FUNCTIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OUR INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS INTERFACE WITH AND DEPEND ON THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE SERVICE DENIALS IF DEMAND FOR SUCH SERVICE EXCEEDS CAPACITY OR A THIRD-PARTY SYSTEM

FAILS OR EXPERIENCES AN INTERRUPTION. IF SUSTAINED OR REPEATED, SUCH A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, SYSTEM FAILURE OR SERVICE DENIAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERIORATION OF OUR ABILITY TO WRITE AND PROCESS NEW

AND RENEWAL BUSINESS, PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE, PAY CLAIMS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR PERFORM OTHER NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. COMPUTER VIRUSES, HACKERS AND OTHER EXTERNAL HAZARDS COULD EXPOSE OUR DATA

SYSTEMS TO SECURITY BREACHES. THESE INCREASED RISKS, AND EXPANDING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING DATA SECURITY, COULD EXPOSE US TO DATA LOSS, MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES AND SIGNIFICANT

INCREASES IN COMPLIANCE COSTS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE

OUTSOURCE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES AND MAY DO SO INCREASINGLY IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT OUR OUTSOURCING

STRATEGY, THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS DO NOT PERFORM AS ANTICIPATED OR WE EXPERIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH A TRANSITION, WE MAY NOT REALIZE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS OR COST EFFICIENCIES AND

MAY EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, INCREASED COSTS AND A LOSS OF BUSINESS. OUR OUTSOURCING OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES MAY EXPOSE US TO ENHANCED RISK

RELATED TO DATA SECURITY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE

IMPACTED BY CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, UNANTICIPATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR POLICIES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS

MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.
