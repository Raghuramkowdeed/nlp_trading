ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO

RAISE

CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE.

OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES

CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HURRICANES, TORNADOES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS AND VOLCANIC

ERUPTIONS. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO BE MAN-MADE, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS), EXPLOSIONS, INFRASTRUCTURE

FAILURES OR A CONSEQUENCE OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR BUSINESS SUBJECTS US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.

HURRICANES FROM MAINE THROUGH TEXAS; TORNADOES THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL, MID-ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEASTERN REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES; EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA, THE NEW MADRID REGION AND THE

PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGION OF NORTH AMERICA; WILDFIRES, PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHWEST; AND TERRORISM IN MAJOR CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO

CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, AS WELL AS TO A VARIETY OF WORLD-WIDE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES THROUGH OUR LLOYD'S OPERATIONS, AND IN BRAZIL

THROUGH OUR JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENT.

THE

INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL AND MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS

COULD INCREASE. MOREOVER, WE COULD EXPERIENCE MORE THAN ONE HIGHLY SEVERE CATASTROPHIC EVENT IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.

SOME

SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT IN RECENT YEARS CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS HAVE ADDED TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND FREQUENCY OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND CREATED ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO

FUTURE TRENDS AND EXPOSURES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN RECENT YEARS HURRICANE ACTIVITY HAS IMPACTED AREAS FURTHER INLAND THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED, THUS EXPANDING OUR OVERALL HURRICANE EXPOSURE. ADDITIONALLY,

BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TORNADOES AND HAIL STORMS HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS.

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALL OF THE CATASTROPHE MODELING TOOLS THAT WE USE, OR THAT WE RELY ON FROM OUTSIDE PARTIES, TO HELP MANAGE CERTAIN OF OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES ARE BASED ON

ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ERROR AND MIS-ESTIMATION AND MAY PRODUCE ESTIMATES THAT ARE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN ACTUAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, COMPARED TO MODELS FOR

HURRICANES, MODELS FOR EARTHQUAKES ARE LESS RELIABLE DUE TO THERE BEING A MORE LIMITED NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL EVENTS TO ANALYZE, WHILE MODELS FOR TORNADOES AND HAIL STORMS ARE NEWER AND MAY

BE EVEN LESS RELIABLE DUE TO THE HIGHLY RANDOM GEOGRAPHIC NATURE AND SIZE OF THESE EVENTS. AS A RESULT, MODELS FOR EARTHQUAKES AND ESPECIALLY FOR TORNADO AND HAIL STORMS MAY HAVE EVEN GREATER

DIFFICULTY PREDICTING RISKS AND ESTIMATING LOSSES. FURTHER, CHANGES IN CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD CAUSE OUR UNDERLYING MODELING DATA TO BE LESS PREDICTIVE, THUS LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY

EVALUATE AND MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK. SEE "WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS PROVIDE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS" BELOW AS WELL AS

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING" AND "CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS."

THE

EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. INCREASES IN THE VALUE

AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF INSURED PROPERTY AND THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION COULD INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF CLAIMS FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC

LOCATION IMPACTED BY TORNADOES IS INHERENTLY RANDOM AND UNPREDICTABLE AND THE SPECIFIC LOCATION IMPACTED BY A TORNADO MAY OR MAY NOT BE HIGHLY POPULATED AND MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF

OUR INSURED EXPOSURES.

STATES

HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME PASSED LEGISLATION, AND REGULATORS HAVE TAKEN ACTION, THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK, SUCH AS

LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS FROM REDUCING EXPOSURES OR WITHDRAWING FROM CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS OR MANDATING THAT INSURERS PARTICIPATE IN RESIDUAL MARKETS. PARTICIPATION IN RESIDUAL MARKET

MECHANISMS HAS RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS TO INSURERS, INCLUDING US, AND, IN CERTAIN STATES, THOSE LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH

OUR DIRECT CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE IN THOSE STATES. IF OUR COMPETITORS LEAVE THOSE STATES HAVING RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS, REMAINING INSURERS, INCLUDING US, MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN

LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE. IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE INITIATIVES AND COURT DECISIONS THAT SEEK TO EXPAND INSURANCE

COVERAGE FOR CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE POLICIES OR SEEK TO PREVENT THE APPLICATION OF DEDUCTIBLES. ALSO, OUR ABILITY TO ADJUST TERMS, INCLUDING DEDUCTIBLE LEVELS, OR TO

INCREASE PRICING TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO OFFSET RISING COSTS OF CATASTROPHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, REQUIRES APPROVAL OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN STATES. OUR

ABILITY OR OUR WILLINGNESS TO MANAGE OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE BY RAISING PRICES, MODIFYING UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCING EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC

POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CHANGES IN THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND/OR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WE ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IN CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS THAT WE MIGHT NOT

OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING OUR ACCESS TO OTHER UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES.

THERE

ARE ALSO FACTORS THAT IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES

CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND;

EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE; BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTABILITY. IN RECENT YEARS, INCREASED LATE REPORTING OF WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES BY CLAIMANTS, PARTICULARLY LOSSES FROM HAIL DAMAGE, HAS LED TO HIGHER COSTS THAN

WE PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ESTIMATES

RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

EXPOSURE

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES RESULTING FROM A CATASTROPHE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS AND COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE

CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE, RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RATINGS. A RATINGS DOWNGRADE COULD HURT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS. IN ADDITION,

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD CAUSE US TO

EXHAUST OUR AVAILABLE REINSURANCE LIMITS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE. SUCH EVENTS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE CREDIT OF OUR REINSURERS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE, SEE "ITEM 1BUSINESSREINSURANCECATASTROPHE REINSURANCE." CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE CREDIT OF

THE ISSUERS OF SECURITIES, SUCH AS STATES OR MUNICIPALITIES, IN WHOM WE HAVE INVESTED.

IN

ADDITION, COVERAGE IN OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR TERRORISM IS LIMITED. ALTHOUGH THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM) PROVIDES BENEFITS IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN ACTS OF

TERRORISM, THOSE BENEFITS ARE SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, ONCE OUR LOSSES EXCEED 20% OF OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PREMIUM FOR THE PRECEDING

CALENDAR YEAR, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE US FOR 85% OF OUR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM WHICH EXCEED THIS DEDUCTIBLE UP TO A TOTAL INDUSTRY PROGRAM CAP OF $100 BILLION.

OUR ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS $2.26 BILLION FOR 2013. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS LAW IS UNTESTED, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW IT WILL BE APPLIED TO

SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ACTION COULD CHANGE THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM IS DUE TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF 2014, UNLESS EXTENDED.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS OR MAN-MADE EVENTS SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK, INCLUDING "UNCONVENTIONAL" ACTS OF

TERRORISM INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY. FURTHER, WHILE WE SEEK

TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL MEANS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF

ONE OR MORE MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL MEANS.

DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OVER THE

PAST SIX YEARS, WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS AND, DURING A PORTION OF THIS PERIOD, THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER ECONOMIES EXPERIENCED A PROLONGED ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN, RESULTING IN HEIGHTENED CREDIT RISK, REDUCED VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS AND DECREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. WHILE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE GENERALLY STABILIZED, THERE IS CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF ANY ECONOMIC RECOVERY. EVEN IF GROWTH CONTINUES, IT MAY BE AT A SLOW RATE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS THE RESIDENTIAL

AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ENVIRONMENT AND EMPLOYMENT RATES, MAY CONTINUE TO BE WEAK.

IN

ADDITION, WHILE INFLATION HAS RECENTLY BEEN LIMITED AND THAT TREND MAY CONTINUE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT STEPS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STABILIZE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND IMPROVE

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO AN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT. FURTHERMORE, FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY AGAIN EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT AND PROLONGED DISRUPTION.

ECONOMIC

UNCERTAINTY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED IN RECENT YEARS BY THE INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT ISSUERS, THE POTENTIAL PARTIAL OR COMPLETE

DISSOLUTION OF THE EUROZONE AND ITS COMMON CURRENCY AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SUCH EVENTS ON GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY. ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS

MAY IMPACT THESE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RISKS. IN THE U.S. DURING 2011, ONE RATING AGENCY DOWNGRADED THE U.S.'S

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LONG-TERM

DEBT CREDIT RATING FROM AAA. FUTURE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING A FAILURE TO INCREASE THE GOVERNMENT DEBT LIMIT OR A SHUTDOWN OF THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT, COULD INCREASE THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RISK THAT THE U.S. MAY NOT ULTIMATELY PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE AND MAY DISRUPT FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING CAPITAL MARKETS. FURTHER, GENERAL

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL BUDGET AND TAXES HAS ADDED TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

IF

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REMAIN WEAK OR DETERIORATE, OR IF FINANCIAL MARKETS EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION, IT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY. SEVERAL OF THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW IDENTIFY RISKS THAT RESULT FROM, OR ARE EXACERBATED BY, AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN OR FINANCIAL DISRUPTION. THESE INCLUDE RISKS

DISCUSSED BELOW RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS, OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES, OUR ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE

ISSUES, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION", PARTICULARLY THE "OUTLOOK" SECTION.

MANY

OF THESE RISKS COULD MATERIALIZE, AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED, EVEN AFTER THE END OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR FINANCIAL DISRUPTION. DURING OR FOLLOWING AN

ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, LOWER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD REDUCE (AND HISTORICALLY HAVE REDUCED) EXPOSURE CHANGES AT RENEWAL. THEY ALSO COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT (AND HISTORICALLY HAVE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED) AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, POLICY ENDORSEMENTS AND MID-TERM CANCELLATIONS AFTER POLICIES ARE WRITTEN, PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESS UNITS WITHIN BUSINESS INSURANCE, WHICH COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR WRITTEN PREMIUMS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE EARNED PREMIUMS LAG WRITTEN PREMIUMS, OUR RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AFTER GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED. AN INFLATIONARY

ENVIRONMENT (WHICH MAY FOLLOW GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY) MAY ALSO, AS WE DISCUSS BELOW, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LOSS COSTS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO. FINALLY, AS A RESULT OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION, WE MAY, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, FACE INCREASED REGULATION.

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED OUR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE NECESSARY, OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES DO NOT

REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE

AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS: CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES; ADVERSE CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS, INCLUDING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ON MEDICAL COSTS AND AUTO AND HOME REPAIR COSTS;

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING GENERAL INFLATION; LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES; AND VARYING JUDGMENTS AND VIEWPOINTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS, AMONG OTHERS. THE

IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER

SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING

LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER).

AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT STEPS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY COULD LEAD TO AN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT, WHICH COULD IN TURN LEAD TO AN INCREASE

IN OUR LOSS COSTS. THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON LOSS COSTS COULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED FOR THOSE LINES OF BUSINESS THAT ARE CONSIDERED "LONG TAIL", SUCH AS GENERAL LIABILITY, AS THEY REQUIRE A RELATIVELY

LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. IN ADDITION, INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN MEDICAL COSTS

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAY

BE INCREASED BY THE HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION. THE ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES MAY ALSO BE MORE DIFFICULT DURING TIMES OF ADVERSE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS DUE TO UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR OF CLAIMANTS AND POLICYHOLDERS, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT REPORTING OF EXPOSURES AND/OR LOSSES, REDUCED MAINTENANCE OF INSURED PROPERTIES OR

INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SMALL CLAIMS OR DELAYS IN THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS.

WE

CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR, ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS, ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND

SETTLED AND THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT EVOLVES. BUSINESS JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO

MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. DIFFERENT EXPERTS MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND AREAS

OF FOCUS. HENCE, SUCH EXPERTS MAY AT TIMES PRODUCE ESTIMATES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. THIS RISK MAY BE EXACERBATED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACQUISITION. EXPERTS PROVIDING INPUT TO THE VARIOUS

ESTIMATES AND UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE ACTUARIES, UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL

VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

WE

ATTEMPT TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED OR REVIEWED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY

UNDERLYING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ESTIMATES, THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WILL LIKELY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE

RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN IS CURRENTLY RESERVED.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM ONE INSURED EVENT, OR AN ACCUMULATION OF INSURED EVENTS, MAY EXCEED THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN

ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

FOR

A DISCUSSION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES BY PRODUCT LINE, INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF COMMON FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT REQUIRED RESERVES, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES."

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR MATERIAL REALIZED OR UNREALIZED LOSSES.

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART

OF OUR

OVERALL PROFITABILITY. FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 93% OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES

CAUSED BY INFLATION OR OTHER FACTORS (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS) AFFECT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS ON OUR FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. A DECLINE

IN INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND NEW FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING THOSE PURCHASED TO RE-INVEST MATURITIES FROM THE EXISTING PORTFOLIO), THEREBY

NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME, WHILE RISING INTEREST RATES REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. INTEREST RATES IN RECENT PERIODS HAVE BEEN AT OR NEAR

HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT RATES MAY REMAIN AT LOW LEVELS FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD. THE VALUE OF OUR FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK

THAT CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MAY DEFAULT OR BECOME IMPAIRED DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR PORTFOLIO, OR DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN INSURER THAT GUARANTEES AN ISSUER'S PAYMENTS OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. SUCH DEFAULTS AND IMPAIRMENTS COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT

LOSSES. DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COULD BE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT.

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED, IN SUBSTANTIAL PART, IN OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL

BOND PORTFOLIO). NOTWITHSTANDING THE RELATIVELY LOW HISTORICAL RATES OF DEFAULT ON MANY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT WE TYPICALLY SEEK TO INVEST IN HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY SECURITIES

(INCLUDING THOSE WITH STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS SUCH AS BEING SECURED BY DEDICATED OR PLEDGED SOURCES OF REVENUE), OUR MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO COULD BE SUBJECT TO DEFAULT OR IMPAIRMENT. IN

PARTICULAR.



THE PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT BEGAN IN 2008, AND THE LIMITED ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT HAS FOLLOWED, HAS RESULTED IN

MANY STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OPERATING UNDER DEFICITS OR PROJECTED DEFICITS. THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THESE DEFICITS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION OF OUR

MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO. THESE DEFICITS MAY BE EXACERBATED BY THE IMPACT OF UNFUNDED PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS OR BY DECLINING MUNICIPAL TAX BASES AND REVENUES IN TIMES OF FINANCIAL STRESS.



SOME ISSUERS MAY BE UNWILLING TO INCREASE TAX RATES, OR TO REDUCE SPENDING, TO FUND INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON

THEIR MUNICIPAL BONDS, OR MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET TO FUND SUCH PAYMENTS. THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD DEFAULTS MAY INCREASE IF SOME ISSUERS VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO DEFAULT, INSTEAD

OF IMPLEMENTING DIFFICULT FISCAL MEASURES, AND THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CONSEQUENCES (SUCH AS REDUCED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS) ARE LESS SEVERE THAN EXPECTED.



THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD DEFAULTS MAY ALSO INCREASE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN LEGISLATION THAT PERMIT STATES, MUNICIPALITIES

AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION WHERE THEY WERE NOT PERMITTED BEFORE. IN ADDITION, THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION OF MUNICIPAL BONDS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THERE

ARE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS IN A BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER PROCEEDING THAT LESSEN THE VALUE OF STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, DEBTORS MAY CHALLENGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS THOUGHT

TO BE PROVIDED BY MUNICIPAL SECURITIES BACKED BY A DEDICATED SOURCE OF REVENUE. THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION MAY ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THERE ARE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS IN A BANKRUPTCY OR

OTHER PROCEEDING THAT QUESTION THE PAYMENT PRIORITY OF MUNICIPAL BONDS.

OUR

PORTFOLIO HAS ALSO BENEFITED FROM TAX EXEMPTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE GOVERNING DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH AS

FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). CHANGES IN THESE LAWS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. SEE "CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS OR IN THE TAX LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE

COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US" BELOW.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES: RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS; PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY

SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES; COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; AND WHOLLY-OWNED REAL

ESTATE, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS AND MORTGAGE LOANS, ALL OF WHICH COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY FURTHER DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUATIONS AND/OR FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION. IN ADDITION, THE

POTENTIAL FOR PROTRACTED DISRUPTION AND/OR SUSPENSION OF FORECLOSURE PRACTICES COULD ALSO IMPACT THE RETURNS ON CERTAIN OF THESE PORTFOLIOS.

WE

ALSO INVEST A PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN

OTHER TYPES OF NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING COMMODITIES. ALL OF THESE ASSET CLASSES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY IN THEIR INVESTMENT RETURNS THAN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. GENERAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND THE REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT

INCOME, AND/OR RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY REALIZE REDUCED RETURNS ON THESE INVESTMENTS, INCUR LOSSES ON SALES OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND BE REQUIRED TO

WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES.

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASED VALUATION UNCERTAINTIES WHEN INVESTMENT MARKETS ARE ILLIQUID. THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE

ILLIQUID, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (I.E., THE CARRYING AMOUNT) OF THE PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AS REFLECTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF PRICES AT WHICH ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS COULD OCCUR.

GIVEN

THAT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, WE MAY, DEPENDING ON CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE FUTURE, MAKE CHANGES TO THE MIX OF INVESTMENTS IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

THESE CHANGES MAY IMPACT THE DURATION, VOLATILITY AND RISK OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE REALIZED AND/OR

UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY.

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BECAUSE OF OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

WITH

REGARD TO ASBESTOS CLAIMS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS (INCLUDING OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY).

FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS AND THE CONTINUED FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. THE FOCUS ON THESE

DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. THE BANKRUPTCY OF MANY TRADITIONAL DEFENDANTS HAS PROMPTED

PLAINTIFFS TO AGGRESSIVELY SEEK OUT POTENTIAL NEW DEFENDANTS AND HAS CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT WHO REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM.

CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE

WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET. THIS TREND OF PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES,

ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS EXPERIENCED BY US.

WE

ALSO CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A

PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED

AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDER'S FAVOR

AND OUR OTHER DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF

ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN A MODERATION IN THE OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE

ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

FURTHER,

IN ADDITION TO ASBESTOS CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH

RESPECT TO THE HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST

INSURERS, INCLUDING US, COULD BE MADE IN THE FUTURE. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST

INSURERS BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY.

WITH

REGARD TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR ALLEGED

DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EFFORTS

AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES

AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES

OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER

CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS

HAVE INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO

JURISDICTION.

UNCERTAINTIES

SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS AND RELATED

LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT

LIMITATION.



THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION;



ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS;



A FURTHER INCREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE, AND/OR THE NUMBER OF, ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS

ANTICIPATED;



THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES WE HAVE ISSUED;



THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS;



THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST US;



FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS;



THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY

LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS; AND



UNCERTAINTIES ARISING FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS.

IT

IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS

ENVIRONMENT COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION AND FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR

JUDICIAL REFORMS ESTABLISHING MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR

COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS

OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE.

WHILE

THE ONGOING EVALUATION OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN

LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND

"ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS." ALSO SEE

"ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS."

WE ARE EXPOSED TO, AND MAY FACE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING, MASS TORT CLAIMS SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR

SUBSTANCES.

IN ADDITION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO OTHER TYPES OF MASS TORT CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING LEAD PAINT, SILICA AND WELDING ROD FUMES. ESTABLISHING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MASS TORT CLAIMS IS SUBJECT TO

UNCERTAINTIES BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, DISPUTES CONCERNING MEDICAL CAUSATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DISEASES, GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION OF THE LAWSUITS

ASSERTING THE CLAIMS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE RISE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS WITHOUT UNDERLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN DISEASE RATES. MOREOVER, EVOLVING

JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS TORT THEORIES AND DEFENSES, INCLUDING APPLICATION OF VARIOUS THEORIES OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF

INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THESE CLAIMS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE, AND SUCH CHANGE COULD BE MATERIAL. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

AS INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL, JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND

OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIM AND COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY EITHER EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OUR

UNDERWRITING INTENT OR BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF CLAIMS. EXAMPLES OF EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.



JUDICIAL EXPANSION OF POLICY COVERAGE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY;



PLAINTIFFS TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATING TO

CLAIMS-HANDLING AND OTHER PRACTICES;



CLAIMS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS, WHICH OFTEN PRESENT COMPLEX COVERAGE AND DAMAGE VALUATION QUESTIONS;



CLAIMS UNDER DIRECTORS' & OFFICERS' INSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO LOSSES FROM INVOLVEMENT IN FINANCIAL MARKET

ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MORTGAGE OR FINANCIAL PRODUCT ORIGINATION, DISTRIBUTION, STRUCTURING OR SERVICING AND FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES; FAILED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; FRAUD, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES; POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES; AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ISSUES;



THE ASSERTION OF "PUBLIC NUISANCE" OR SIMILAR THEORIES OF LIABILITY, PURSUANT TO WHICH PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO RECOVER MONIES

SPENT TO ADMINISTER PUBLIC HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, ABATE HAZARDS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND/OR RECOVER DAMAGES PURPORTEDLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A "PUBLIC NUISANCE";



CLAIMS RELATING TO MOLESTATION BY AN EMPLOYEE OF AN INSURED;



MEDICAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT LINK HEALTH ISSUES TO PARTICULAR CAUSES (FOR EXAMPLE, CUMULATIVE TRAUMA), RESULTING IN LIABILITY

OR WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS;



CLAIMS RELATING TO UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES OF CURRENT OR NEW TECHNOLOGIES; AND



CLAIMS RELATING TO POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, INCLUDING HIGHER FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF WEATHER-RELATED

EVENTS.

IN

SOME INSTANCES, THESE EMERGING ISSUES MAY NOT BECOME APPARENT FOR SOME TIME AFTER WE HAVE ISSUED THE AFFECTED INSURANCE POLICIES. AS A RESULT, THE FULL EXTENT OF LIABILITY UNDER OUR

INSURANCE POLICIES MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THE POLICIES ARE ISSUED.

IN

ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL PASSAGE OF NEW LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO EXPAND THE RIGHT TO SUE, TO REMOVE LIMITATIONS ON RECOVERY, TO DEEM BY STATUTE THE EXISTENCE OF A COVERED OCCURRENCE, TO

EXTEND THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OR OTHERWISE TO REPEAL OR WEAKEN TORT REFORMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

THE

EFFECTS OF THESE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY.

THE

PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL REMAIN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INSURERS WHICH MAY OFFER

PRODUCTS AT PRICES AND ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ECONOMIC STANDARDS IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE THEIR BUSINESS. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ALSO BE

IMPACTED BY CURRENT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS AVAILABLE TO US AS WELL AS TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT COULD BE IMPACTED BY

CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, INCLUDING CUSTOMER

DEMAND FOR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONOUTLOOK."

IN

PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE USE OF COMPARATIVE RATING TECHNOLOGIES HAS IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT, OUR BUSINESS AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE

COMPANY'S PERSONAL INSURANCE NEW BUSINESS IS WRITTEN AFTER AN AGENT COMPARES QUOTES USING COMPARATIVE RATING TECHNOLOGIES, A COST-EFFICIENT MEANS OF OBTAINING QUOTES FROM MULTIPLE

COMPANIES. BECAUSE THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, WHETHER BY AGENTS OR DIRECTLY BY CUSTOMERS, FACILITATES THE PROCESS OF GENERATING MULTIPLE QUOTES, THE TECHNOLOGY HAS INCREASED PRICE COMPARISON ON NEW

BUSINESS AND, INCREASINGLY, ON RENEWAL BUSINESS. IT ALSO HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF QUOTE ACTIVITY AND A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF QUOTES THAT RESULT IN NEW BUSINESS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND

THESE TRENDS MAY CONTINUE OR ACCELERATE. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OPERATE WITH A COMPETITIVE COST STRUCTURE OR ACCURATELY ESTIMATE AND PRICE FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, OUR UNDERWRITING

MARGINS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OVER TIME. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED TO ACCESS COMPARATIVE RATES FOR SMALL COMMERCIAL BUSINESS. AGENTS, BROKERS OR OTHER

THIRD PARTIES MAY ALSO CREATE ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS, SUCH AS INSURANCE EXCHANGES, THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND PRICING.

OTHER

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY PRESENT COMPETITIVE RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, INNOVATIONS, SUCH AS TELEMATICS AND OTHER USAGE-BASED METHODS OF DETERMINING PREMIUMS, CAN IMPACT PRODUCT DESIGN

AND PRICING AND MAY BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTOR. OTHER POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, SUCH AS DRIVERLESS CARS, COULD DISRUPT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM CURRENT

CUSTOMERS, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION COULD BE IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO DEPLOY, IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER, TECHNOLOGY THAT COLLECTS AND

ANALYZES A WIDE VARIETY OF DATA POINTS (SO-CALLED "BIG DATA" ANALYSIS) TO MAKE UNDERWRITING OR OTHER DECISIONS. SEE ALSO "OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON

EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY" BELOW.

IN

RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERWRITING MARGINS ON MANY OF OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS, AND COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS MAY IMPACT THE SUCCESS OF THESE

EFFORTS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE SEEKING IMPROVED RATES, AS WELL AS IMPROVED TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND ALSO INCLUDE OTHER INITIATIVES, SUCH AS REDUCING OPERATING EXPENSES AND ACQUISITION COSTS. THESE

EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND/OR MAY RESULT IN LOWER RETENTION AND NEW BUSINESS LEVELS AND THEREFORE LOWER BUSINESS VOLUMES. IN ADDITION, IF OUR UNDERWRITING IS NOT EFFECTIVE, EFFORTS TO INCREASE

RATES COULD ALSO LEAD TO "ADVERSE SELECTION", WHEREBY ACCOUNTS RETAINED HAVE HIGHER LOSSES, AND ARE LESS PROFITABLE, THAN ACCOUNTS LOST. FOR MORE DETAIL, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONOUTLOOK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

PARTICULAR, IN OUR AGENCY AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS, WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERWRITING MARGINS, WHICH HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS.

THESE FACTORS INCLUDE (I) CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND FOR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, (II) UTILIZATION OF COMPARATIVE RATING TECHNOLOGIES BY AGENTS, (III) OTHER

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND (IV) LOSS COST INCREASES THAT HAVE EXCEEDED EARNED RATE INCREASES. IF OUR STRATEGIES TO INCREASE PROFITABILITY THROUGH THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE

ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, WE MAY NEED TO EXPLORE OTHER ACTIONS OR INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND PROFITABILITY IN THIS LINE OF BUSINESS.

OVERALL,

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IN OUR VARIOUS BUSINESSES IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO OUR.



ABILITY TO PROFITABLY PRICE OUR BUSINESS, RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND OBTAIN NEW BUSINESS;



PREMIUMS CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED (INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED

PROGRAMS);



AGENT, BROKER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS;



ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS;



SPEED OF CLAIMS PAYMENT;



ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER;



PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CORRESPONDING RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES;



REPUTATION, EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES;



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS; AND



LOCAL PRESENCE.

WE

MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN CONTINUING TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON ANY OF THESE BASES IN THE FUTURE. IF COMPETITION LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING BUSINESS OR WRITE NEW BUSINESS AT

ADEQUATE RATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE "COMPETITION" SECTIONS OF THE DISCUSSION ON BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN "ITEM 1BUSINESS."

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT

ALL.

ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO US TO THE EXTENT OF THE CEDED REINSURANCE, WE REMAIN LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. AS A RESULT,

CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT ELIMINATE OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS.

IN

THE PAST, CERTAIN REINSURERS HAVE CEASED WRITING BUSINESS AND ENTERED INTO RUNOFF. SOME OF OUR REINSURANCE CLAIMS MAY BE DISPUTED BY THE REINSURERS, AND WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE

PARTIAL OR NO PAYMENT. THIS IS A PARTICULAR RISK IN THE CASE OF CLAIMS THAT RELATE TO INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN

ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS

CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE CERTAIN AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS COMPRISE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

SETTLE CERTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PORTION.

IN CASES WHERE WE DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT IS INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AS WE RETAIN THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IN THE

EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS IF AND TO THE EXTENT NOT PAID BY STATE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS.

MANY

REINSURANCE COMPANIES AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE FINANCIAL MARKETS DISRUPTION AND THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. A NUMBER OF

THESE COMPANIES, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF THOSE WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OR TO WHICH WE OTHERWISE HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE, WERE DOWNGRADED BY VARIOUS RATING AGENCIES DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF OUR TOP REINSURANCE GROUPS BY REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE AND THE TOP FIVE GROUPS BY AMOUNT OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS PROVIDED, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES."

THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRICE AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY. THE AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE CAPACITY CAN BE

IMPACTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONS IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET, SUCH AS THE OCCURRENCE OF SIGNIFICANT REINSURED EVENTS. THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE COULD AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL, AND/OR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY FAIL TO MAKE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, AND THUS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION TO EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES (DISCUSSED ABOVE), WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN SEVERAL OTHER AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK RELATING TO POLICYHOLDERS, INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND

BROKERS.

WE

ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN OUR SURETY INSURANCE OPERATIONS, WHERE WE GUARANTEE TO A THIRD PARTY THAT OUR CUSTOMER WILL SATISFY CERTAIN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (E.G., A

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT) OR CERTAIN FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. IF A CUSTOMER OF OURS DEFAULTS, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES AND NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THAT CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, IT IS CUSTOMARY PRACTICE IN THE

SURETY BUSINESS FOR MULTIPLE INSURERS TO PARTICIPATE AS CO-SURETIES ON LARGE SURETY BONDS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE

CO-SURETY OBLIGATIONS ARE TYPICALLY JOINT AND SEVERAL, IN WHICH CASE WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR CO-SURETIES.

IN

ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO

PAY THE CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. WE ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, AND, AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK TO THE POLICYHOLDER.

MOREOVER, CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICIES (I.E., POLICIES IN WHICH PREMIUMS ARE ADJUSTED AFTER THE POLICY PERIOD BASED ON THE ACTUAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER DURING THE POLICY PERIOD). RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADJUSTED PREMIUM IS GREATER THAN THE ORIGINAL

PREMIUM.

OUR

EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK THAT WE HAVE TO OUR INSUREDS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. TO REDUCE SUCH CREDIT RISK, WE REQUIRE CERTAIN INSUREDS TO POST COLLATERAL FOR SOME OR ALL OF

THESE OBLIGATIONS, OFTEN IN THE FORM OF PLEDGED SECURITIES SUCH AS MONEY MARKET FUNDS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY BANKS. IN CASES WHERE WE RECEIVE PLEDGED SECURITIES AND THE INSUREDS ARE UNABLE

TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON THE SECURITIES PLEDGED AND/OR THE RISK THAT OUR ACCESS TO THAT COLLATERAL MAY BE STAYED DURING AN INSURED'S BANKRUPTCY. IN CASES WHERE

WE RECEIVE LETTERS OF CREDIT FROM BANKS AND THE INSUREDS ARE UNABLE TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE BANKS THAT ISSUED THE LETTERS OF CREDIT.

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHEN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE INSURANCE POLICIES FROM US THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE PREMIUMS RELATING TO THOSE POLICIES ARE OFTEN

PAID TO THE AGENTS AND BROKERS FOR PAYMENT TO US. IN MOST JURISDICTIONS, THE PREMIUMS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PAID TO US WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY US. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ASSUME A

DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS DUE FROM INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

TO

A LARGE DEGREE, THE CREDIT RISK WE FACE IS A FUNCTION OF THE ECONOMY; ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE A GREATER RISK IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE RISKS DISCUSSED ABOVE

THROUGH UNDERWRITING AND INVESTMENT GUIDELINES, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS, OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE, COLLATERAL OBTAINED MAY SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE LITTLE

OR NO VALUE. AS A RESULT, OUR EXPOSURE TO THE ABOVE CREDIT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED BY THE STATES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT

BUSINESS, INCLUDING LICENSING AND SUPERVISION, AND CHANGES IN REGULATION MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

THESE REGULATORY SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY

DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS, AND NOT NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF INSURERS, THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INVESTORS. FOR EXAMPLE, TO PROTECT POLICYHOLDERS WHOSE INSURANCE COMPANY

BECOMES FINANCIALLY INSOLVENT, GUARANTY FUNDS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ALL 50 STATES TO PAY THE COVERED CLAIMS OF POLICYHOLDERS IN THE EVENT OF AN INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURER, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE STATE

LIMITS. THE FUNDING OF GUARANTY FUNDS IS PROVIDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST REMAINING INSURERS IN THE MARKETPLACE. AS A RESULT, THE INSOLVENCY OF ONE OR MORE INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD RESULT

IN ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST US.

THESE

REGULATORY SYSTEMS ALSO ADDRESS AUTHORIZATION FOR LINES OF BUSINESS, POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS, LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, UNDERWRITING

LIMITATIONS, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS, CHANGES IN CONTROL, PREMIUM RATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF AN INSURER'S BUSINESS.

IN

RECENT YEARS, THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, AND SOME STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR INCREASE STATE

AUTHORITY TO REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES. FURTHER, THE NAIC AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY REEXAMINE EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING

ON MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN A TIME OF FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY OR A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN

OR OTHERWISE, REGULATORS MAY CHOOSE TO ADOPT MORE RESTRICTIVE INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, INSURANCE REGULATORS MAY CHOOSE TO RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE

PAYMENTS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES OR REJECT RATE INCREASES DUE TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS MAY ALSO INCREASE THE STATUTORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES.

IN

ADDITION, STATE TAX LAWS THAT SPECIFICALLY IMPACT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES OR OTHER TAXES, MAY BE ENACTED OR CHANGED BY STATES TO RAISE REVENUES.

STATE

LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR HIGHER COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND THUS

COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

CHANGES IN FEDERAL REGULATION COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON US AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

WHILE THE U.S. FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT

HAS NOT HISTORICALLY REGULATED THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, IN 2010 THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE DODD-FRANK ACT) ESTABLISHED A FEDERAL

INSURANCE OFFICE WITHIN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. THE FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE HAS LIMITED REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND IS EMPOWERED TO GATHER DATA AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE INSURANCE

INDUSTRY AND INSURERS, INCLUDING CONDUCTING A STUDY FOR SUBMISSION TO THE U.S. CONGRESS ON HOW TO MODERNIZE AND IMPROVE INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE U.S. FURTHER, THE DODD-FRANK ACT GIVES

THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER A NUMBER OF NONBANK FINANCIAL SERVICES

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HOLDING

COMPANIES, INCLUDING INSURANCE COMPANIES, IF THEY ARE DESIGNATED BY A TWO-THIRDS VOTE OF A FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE COUNCIL) AS "SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS" (SIFI). BASED ON RULES AND INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL, WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE DESIGNATED AS A SIFI. NONETHELESS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COUNCIL MAY CHANGE

ITS RULES OR INTERPRETATIONS IN THE FUTURE AND CONCLUDE THAT WE ARE A SIFI. IF WE WERE DESIGNATED AS "SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT," THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY COULD INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO

IMPOSE HEIGHTENED FINANCIAL REGULATION AND COULD IMPACT REQUIREMENTS REGARDING OUR CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE AS WELL AS OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT CONDUCT. AS A RESULT OF THE FOREGOING, THE

DODD-FRANK ACT, OR OTHER ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REGULATION THAT IS ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE, COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON US, INCLUDING IMPACTING THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS,

INCREASING COMPLIANCE COSTS AND DUPLICATING STATE REGULATION, AND COULD RESULT IN A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE, PARTICULARLY RELATIVE TO OTHER INSURERS THAT MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LEVEL OF

REGULATION.

EVEN

IF WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SECTOR REGULATORY REFORM, INCLUDING THE DODD-FRANK ACT, COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON US. FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATORY REFORM COULD HAVE AN UNEXPECTED IMPACT ON OUR RIGHTS AS A CREDITOR OR ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN PARTICULAR, THE DODD-FRANK ACT

AUTHORIZES ASSESSMENTS TO PAY FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BECOME INSOLVENT. WE (AS A FINANCIAL COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN ASSETS)

COULD BE ASSESSED, AND, ALTHOUGH ANY SUCH ASSESSMENT IS REQUIRED TO BE RISK WEIGHTED (I.E., RISKIER FIRMS PAY MORE), SUCH COSTS COULD BE MATERIAL TO US AND ARE NOT CURRENTLY ESTIMABLE.

OTHER

POTENTIAL CHANGES IN U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL REPEAL OF THE MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT (WHICH EXEMPTS INSURANCE FROM

MOST FEDERAL REGULATION) AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN FEDERAL TAXATION, COULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING US.

A DOWNGRADE IN OUR CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INCREASE

OUR

BORROWING COSTS.

CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO AN INSURER'S COMPETITIVE POSITION. RATING AGENCIES PERIODICALLY REVIEW INSURERS'

RATINGS AND CHANGE THEIR RATINGS CRITERIA; THEREFORE, OUR CURRENT RATINGS MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES

BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE REDUCED, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE MANY CUSTOMERS MAY REQUIRE THAT WE MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATINGS TO ENTER INTO OR RENEW BUSINESS WITH US. ADDITIONALLY, WE

MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND WE MAY INCUR HIGHER BORROWING COSTS. IF SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RESULTING FROM ONE OR MORE MAJOR

CATASTROPHES, OR SIGNIFICANT RESERVE ADDITIONS OR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT LOSSES WERE TO CAUSE OUR CAPITAL POSITION TO DETERIORATE SIGNIFICANTLY, OR IF ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE

(WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO AT A REASONABLE COST OR AT ALL, ESPECIALLY AT A TIME OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION) IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR LIMIT THE EXTENT OF A DOWNGRADE. A CONTINUED

TREND OF MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHES OR A PROLONGED FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN MAY LEAD RATING AGENCIES TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. SEE ALSO "DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED." FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR

RATINGS, SEE, "ITEM 1BUSINESSRATINGS."

THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS, PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER

DIVIDENDS

OR MAKE FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES.

OUR HOLDING COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND

PRINCIPAL ON OUTSTANDING DEBT, TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN, TO PAY OTHER CORPORATE EXPENSES AND TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES. THE

ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

HOLDING COMPANY IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THEIR STATUTORY SURPLUS, EARNINGS AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY SOME STATES AS AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. IN A TIME OF PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR OTHERWISE, REGULATORS MAY CHOOSE TO

FURTHER RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IS ALSO RESTRICTED

BY REGULATIONS THAT SET STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED.

THE

INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS COULD HARM

OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS, TO PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES.

DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS

PRIMARILY

THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN THROUGH LESS THAN A DOZEN SUCH INTERMEDIARIES. FURTHER, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND OF INCREASED CONSOLIDATION BY AGENTS

AND BROKERS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH AND FEES

PAID TO SOME AGENTS AND BROKERS. LOSS OF ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDED THROUGH SUCH AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE

MAY ALSO SEEK TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INCLUDING OUR CURRENT EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PLATFORM IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE

SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, AGENTS AND BROKERS MAY CREATE ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS, SUCH AS INSURANCE EXCHANGES, THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND PRICING.

OUR EFFORTS OR THEIR EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS WHO CURRENTLY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS,

RESULTING IN A LOWER VOLUME OF BUSINESS GENERATED FROM THESE SOURCES.

WE

RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKETING AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY INCREASINGLY RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS AND TOLL-FREE NUMBERS FOR

DISTRIBUTION. IN SOME INSTANCES, OUR AGENTS AND BROKERS ARE REQUIRED TO ACCESS SEPARATE BUSINESS PLATFORMS TO EXECUTE THE SALE OF OUR PERSONAL INSURANCE OR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. SHOULD

INTERNET DISRUPTIONS OCCUR, OR FRUSTRATION WITH OUR BUSINESS PLATFORMS OR DISTRIBUTION INITIATIVES DEVELOP AMONG OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, ANY RESULTING LOSS OF BUSINESS COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE "IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA SECURITY AND/OR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR

BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED" BELOW.

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN TARGETED MARKETS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND MAY CREATE ENHANCED RISKS.

A NUMBER OF OUR

RECENT AND

PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES INVOLVE DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPANDING EXISTING PRODUCTS IN TARGETED MARKETS. THIS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING EFFORTS, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO PROTECT OR GROW MARKET

SHARE.



WE MAY DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT INSURE RISKS WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY INSURED OR CONTAIN NEW COVERAGE OR COVERAGE TERMS.



WE MAY REFINE OUR UNDERWRITING PROCESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASED THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS THAT FLOWS THROUGH OUR AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING SYSTEMS.



WE MAY SEEK TO EXPAND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, SUCH AS OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PLATFORM IN PERSONAL

INSURANCE.

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS



WE MAY FOCUS ON GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE HAVE HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE OR NO MARKET

SHARE.

WE

MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPANDING IN TARGETED MARKETS AND, EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL, THESE EFFORTS MAY CREATE ENHANCED RISKS. AMONG OTHER

RISKS.



DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR IN NEW MARKETS MAY NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS.



TO THE EXTENT WE ARE ABLE TO MARKET NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN NEW MARKETS, OUR RISK EXPOSURES MAY CHANGE, AND THE DATA AND

MODELS WE USE TO MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES MAY NOT BE AS SOPHISTICATED AS THOSE WE USE IN EXISTING MARKETS OR WITH EXISTING PRODUCTS. THIS, IN TURN, COULD LEAD TO LOSSES IN EXCESS OF OUR EXPECTATIONS.



MODELS UNDERLYING AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DECISIONS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.



EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE OR INCREASE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CONFLICT, SUCH AS

DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER "DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US."



IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS TO A NEW PRODUCT, SOME POLICYHOLDERS' PRICING MAY INCREASE,

WHILE THE PRICING FOR OTHER POLICYHOLDERS MAY DECREASE, THE NET IMPACT OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT RETENTION AND MARGINS.



TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, WE MAY NEED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES, WHICH MAY ALSO

NEGATIVELY IMPACT RESULTS IN THE NEAR TERM.

IF

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN TARGETED MARKETS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS OR IN THE TAX LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US.

TAX LAWS MAY CHANGE

IN WAYS THAT

ADVERSELY IMPACT US. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED TO REDUCE THE EXISTING STATUTORY U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35%, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDINGLY, REDUCE ANY U.S.

DEFERRED TAX ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF ANY NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS VOLATILE AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES. THE EFFECT OF A REDUCTION IN A TAX RATE ON NET

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED, IN FULL, AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN ENACTED AND, ALONG WITH OTHER CHANGES IN THE TAX RULES THAT MAY

INCREASE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL TAX EXPENSE, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS BENEFITED FROM TAX EXEMPTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE GOVERNING DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH

AS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). FEDERAL AND/OR STATE TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED IN CONNECTION WITH DEFICIT REDUCTION OR VARIOUS TYPES OF FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM THAT WOULD LESSEN OR ELIMINATE SOME OR

ALL OF THE TAX ADVANTAGES CURRENTLY BENEFITING US AND THEREFORE COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, SUCH LEGISLATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PARTICULARLY CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF INTEREST FROM MUNICIPAL BONDS (WHICH COMPRISE 52% OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012) COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF THOSE BONDS.

OTHER

TAX LAW CHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US. THE SIZE OF THE FEDERAL DEFICIT, AS WELL AS THE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS FACED BY MANY STATES AND LOCALITIES, INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

CONGRESS AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL RAISE REVENUE BY ENACTING LEGISLATION INCREASING THE TAXES PAID BY INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS PROVIDE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS.

THE

PROFITABILITY OF OUR

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS WE USE

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

PRICING OUR POLICIES. WE UTILIZE THIRD-PARTY AND PROPRIETARY MODELS TO HELP US PRICE BUSINESS IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO BE CONSISTENT, OVER TIME, WITH ACTUAL RESULTS AND RETURN OBJECTIVES. WE

INCORPORATE THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, EXTERNAL INDUSTRY DATA AND ECONOMIC INDICES INTO OUR MODELING PROCESSES, AND WE USE VARIOUS METHODS, INCLUDING PREDICTIVE MODELING, FORECASTING

AND SOPHISTICATED SIMULATION MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE LOSS TRENDS AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE ALSO USE THESE MODELING PROCESSES, ANALYSES AND METHODS IN MAKING

UNDERWRITING, PRICING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS AS PART OF MANAGING OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES AND OTHER EXTREME ADVERSE EVENTS. THESE MODELING PROCESSES INCORPORATE NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND

FORECASTS ABOUT THE FUTURE LEVEL AND VARIABILITY OF: INTEREST RATES, INFLATION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES, AMONG OTHERS, THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO MAKE AND MAY DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.

WHETHER

WE USE A PROPRIETARY OR THIRD-PARTY MODEL, FUTURE EXPERIENCE MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM PAST AND CURRENT EXPERIENCE INCORPORATED IN A MODEL'S FORECASTS OR SIMULATIONS. THIS

INCLUDES THE LIKELIHOOD OF EVENTS OCCURRING OR CONTINUING OR THE CORRELATION AMONG EVENTS. THIRD PARTY MODELS MAY PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN WHAT OUR PROPRIETARY MODELING

PROCESSES PROVIDE. AS A RESULT, THIRD-PARTY MODEL ESTIMATES OF LOSSES CAN BE, AND OFTEN HAVE BEEN, MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FOR SIMILAR EVENTS IN COMPARISON TO OUR PROPRIETARY ESTIMATES. THE DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THIRD-PARTY MODEL ESTIMATES AND OUR PROPRIETARY ESTIMATES ARE DRIVEN BY THE USE OF DIFFERENT DATA SETS AS WELL AS DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND FORECASTS REGARDING THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF

EVENTS AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE EVENTS.

IF

WE FAIL TO APPROPRIATELY PRICE THE RISKS WE INSURE, OR FAIL TO CHANGE OUR PRICING MODEL TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT OUR CURRENT EXPERIENCE, OR IF OUR CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS MORE FREQUENT

OR SEVERE THAN OUR UNDERLYING RISK ASSUMPTIONS, OUR PROFIT MARGINS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE FREQUENCY AND/OR SEVERITY OF EXTREME ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRING, OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE RISKS WE ARE EXPOSED TO, WE MAY OVERPRICE OUR PRODUCTS, AND NEW BUSINESS GROWTH AND RETENTION OF OUR EXISTING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. AS WE EXPAND INTO DIFFERENT MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES, WE WILL WRITE MORE POLICIES IN MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS WHERE WE HAVE LESS DATA SPECIFIC TO THESE NEW MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES, AND,

ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ERROR IN OUR MODELS AND STRATEGY. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING."

OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY.

WE DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS FOR CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND PROCESSING CLAIMS, AS WELL AS FOR PROVIDING THE DATA AND ANALYTICS WE

UTILIZE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS, AND THUS OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON MAINTAINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ENHANCE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS

THAT SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN A COST AND RESOURCE EFFICIENT MANNER. SOME SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR

EXPENSE RATIOS AS WE INVEST IN THE PROJECTS AND MAY COST MORE THAN WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE. IN ADDITION, SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY NOT DELIVER THE BENEFITS WE EXPECT ONCE THEY ARE COMPLETE, OR MAY

BE REPLACED OR BECOME OBSOLETE MORE QUICKLY THAN EXPECTED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ACCELERATED RECOGNITION OF EXPENSES. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGE AND UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY

PORTFOLIO, OR IF THE COSTS OF DOING SO ARE HIGHER THAN WE EXPECT, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE SERVICES TO NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA SECURITY AND/OR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

WHILE TECHNOLOGY CAN STREAMLINE MANY BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE COST OF OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISKS.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR EMPLOYEES' ABILITY TO PERFORM, IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. A SHUT-DOWN OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS,

ONE OR MORE

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF

OUR FACILITIES (INCLUDING OUR PRIMARY DATA PROCESSING FACILITY); A POWER OUTAGE; OR A FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SUCH FUNCTIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS, PARTICULARLY IF SUCH AN INTERRUPTION LASTS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER SUCH AS A NATURAL CATASTROPHE,

TERRORIST ATTACK OR INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT, OR DUE TO A COMPUTER VIRUS, OUR SYSTEMS COULD BE INACCESSIBLE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS INCREASINGLY INTERFACE WITH AND DEPEND ON THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE SERVICE DENIALS OR FAILURES OF CONTROLS IF DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICE EXCEEDS CAPACITY OR A

THIRD-PARTY SYSTEM FAILS OR EXPERIENCES AN INTERRUPTION. IF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS SUCH A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, SYSTEM FAILURE OR SERVICE DENIAL, THIS COULD RESULT

IN A DETERIORATION OF OUR ABILITY TO WRITE AND PROCESS NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS, PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE, PAY CLAIMS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR PERFORM OTHER NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS.

OUR

OPERATIONS RELY ON THE RELIABLE AND SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. COMPUTER VIRUSES, HACKERS,

EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND OTHER EXTERNAL HAZARDS COULD EXPOSE OUR DATA SYSTEMS TO SECURITY BREACHES,

CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY E-MAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WHILE WE ATTEMPT

TO DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES WITH THIRD-PARTY VENDORS AND OTHERS WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL OF SUCH VENDORS AND THIRD

PARTIES AND, IN ADDITION, THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION.

OUR

COMPUTER SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE, SUBJECT TO COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODES, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER COMPUTER-RELATED

PENETRATIONS. WHILE, TO DATE, WE ARE NOT AWARE THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL BREACH OF CYBER SECURITY, ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL CONTROLS AS WELL AS OTHER PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO

REDUCE THE RISK OF CYBER INCIDENTS AND PROTECT OUR INFORMATION MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO PREVENT PHYSICAL AND ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER SECURITY BREACHES TO OUR COMPUTER

SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD RESULT IN GREATER OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY MAY FURTHER EXPOSE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO THE RISKS OF

CYBER-ATTACKS. WE MAY FOREGO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH NEW TECHNOLOGY TO LIMIT THIS ADDITIONAL RISK.

THESE

INCREASED RISKS, AND EXPANDING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING DATA SECURITY, COULD EXPOSE US TO DATA LOSS, DISRUPTION OF SERVICE, MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES AND

SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN COMPLIANCE COSTS AND COSTS TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY AND RESILIENCY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE

HAVE INCREASINGLY OUTSOURCED CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT

AND MONITOR OUR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS DO NOT PERFORM AS ANTICIPATED OR WE EXPERIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH A TRANSITION, WE MAY NOT REALIZE EXPECTED

PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS OR COST EFFICIENCIES AND MAY EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, INCREASED COSTS AND A LOSS OF BUSINESS. OUR OUTSOURCING OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS

TO THIRD PARTIES MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISK RELATED TO DATA SECURITY OR SERVICE DISRUPTIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SERVICES

FROM THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE IMPACTED BY CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, UNANTICIPATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR POLICIES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES PRIMARILY

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A JOINT VENTURE IN BRAZIL AND MAY ALSO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND

OTHER EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS INDIA AND CHINA.

WHILE

OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES CURRENTLY CONSTITUTES A RELATIVELY SMALL PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, IN CONDUCTING SUCH BUSINESS WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

RISKS, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE LIMITS, OWNERSHIP LIMITS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE OR

ANTI-COMPETITIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION. OUR INVESTMENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY ALSO SUBJECT US TO CURRENCY RISK

AND, IN SOME MARKETS, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE THAT RISK. IN ADDITION, IN SOME MARKETS, WE MAY INVEST AS PART OF A JOINT VENTURE WITH A LOCAL COUNTERPARTY. BECAUSE OUR GOVERNANCE

RIGHTS MAY BE LIMITED, WE MAY NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE ABILITY OF THE JOINT VENTURE TO MAKE CERTAIN DECISIONS AND/OR MITIGATE RISKS IT FACES, AND SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS WITH A JOINT VENTURE

COUNTERPARTY MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT. INVESTMENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES

ACT AND SIMILAR LAWS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT PROHIBIT THE MAKING OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN OFFICIALS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POLICIES AND CONTROLS IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH

THESE LAWS, IF THOSE CONTROLS ARE INEFFECTIVE AND AN EMPLOYEE OR INTERMEDIARY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD SUFFER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND OUR BUSINESS AND

OUR REPUTATION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SOME COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY

EMERGING ECONOMIES, HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LACK CLARITY AND, EVEN WITH LOCAL EXPERTISE AND EFFECTIVE CONTROLS, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF, AND POTENTIAL

LIABILITY UNDER, THE LOCAL LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING BRAZIL, PARTIES TO A JOINT VENTURE MAY, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, HAVE LIABILITY FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS OF THE VENTURE AND

THAT LIABILITY MAY EXTEND BEYOND THE CAPITAL INVESTED. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT

ONLY ON OUR BUSINESS IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY.

NEW REGULATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., INCLUDING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR

GROWTH.

INSURANCE LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND

MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR HIGHER COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND THUS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

IN

PARTICULAR, THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EXECUTIVE BODY, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, IS IMPLEMENTING NEW CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND RISK MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS CALLED SOLVENCY II THAT WOULD APPLY TO

OUR BUSINESSES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BEGINNING AS SOON AS JANUARY 1, 2014; HOWEVER, THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION DATE MAY BE DELAYED. UNDER SOLVENCY II, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DIRECT OR

INDIRECT PARENT OF A EUROPEAN UNION SUBSIDIARY (INCLUDING A U.S. PARENT COMPANY) COULD BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SOLVENCY II REQUIREMENTS IF THE REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT THE SUBSIDIARY'S CAPITAL POSITION

IS DEPENDENT ON AN AFFILIATED OR PARENT COMPANY AND THE AFFILIATED OR PARENT COMPANY IS NOT ALREADY SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS DEEMED "EQUIVALENT" TO SOLVENCY II. IN ADDITION, REGULATORS IN COUNTRIES

WHERE WE HAVE OPERATIONS ARE WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS (IAIS) (AND IN THE U.S., WITH THE NAIC) TO CONSIDER CHANGES TO INSURANCE COMPANY SUPERVISION, INCLUDING

GROUP SUPERVISION.

THE

IAIS IS WORKING WITH THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (FSB) CREATED BY THE G-20 AND IS DEVELOPING A METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AND WHICH, IF ANY, INSURANCE

COMPANIES POSE A SYSTEMIC RISK TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. SUCH INSURERS WOULD BE DESIGNATED "GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSURERS" (G-SIIS) AND WOULD LIKELY BE SUBJECT TO HIGHER CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, ENHANCED SUPERVISION OR BOTH. THE IAIS HAS RELEASED FOR COMMENT PROPOSED METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL G-SIIS BUT HAS NOT YET DECIDED UPON THE CRITERIA FOR, OR THE

CONSEQUENCES OF, SUCH DESIGNATION. UPON FINALIZING THE

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSESSMENT

METHODOLOGY AND DETERMINING THE CONSEQUENCES OF A G-SII DESIGNATION, THE FSB ALONG WITH NATIONAL AUTHORITIES EXPECT TO PUBLISH THE LIST OF G-SIIS IN APRIL 2013.

WHILE

IT IS NOT YET KNOWN HOW THESE ACTIONS WILL IMPACT US, SUCH REGULATION COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS OF COMPLIANCE, INCREASED DISCLOSURE AND LESS FLEXIBILITY IN OUR CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT.

ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY RESULT IN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

FROM TIME TO

TIME WE MAY

INVESTIGATE AND PURSUE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES IF WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES AND THAT THE POTENTIAL REWARDS OF AN ACQUISITION JUSTIFY

THE RISKS. THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING AN ACQUIRED COMPANY OR BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, HOWEVER, AND MAY CREATE UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENDITURES. FOR EXAMPLE, ACQUISITIONS

MAY PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISKS, INCLUDING.



THE POTENTIAL DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESS;



THE INEFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS HANDLING AND ACTUARIAL PRACTICES;



THE UNCERTAINTY OF AN ACQUIREE'S RESERVE ESTIMATES;



THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO ACQUISITION INTEGRATION CHALLENGES;



THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES;



THE CULTURAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING EMPLOYEES; AND



THE IMPACT OF AN ACQUISITION ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR CREDIT RATINGS.

THE

ACQUIRED BUSINESS MAY NOT PERFORM AS PROJECTED, AND ANY COST SAVINGS AND OTHER SYNERGIES ANTICIPATED FROM THE ACQUISITION MAY NOT MATERIALIZE. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY

BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE FUTURE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED, AND THE INEFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF OUR BUSINESSES AND PROCESSES MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR DELAYS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE.

CHANGES TO EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPORTED RESULTS.

AS A U.S.-BASED SEC REPORTING COMPANY, WE ARE

CURRENTLY REQUIRED

TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP), AS PROMULGATED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB). DURING THE LAST SEVERAL

YEARS, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) HAS BEEN EVALUATING WHETHER, WHEN AND HOW INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE U.S. FINANCIAL

REPORTING SYSTEM, INCLUDING FOR COMPANIES SUCH AS US. THE FASB AND THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (IASB) HAVE ALSO EMBARKED ON A LONG-TERM PROJECT TO CONVERGE GAAP AND IFRS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE IASB AND THE FASB ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A GLOBAL INSURANCE STANDARD THAT MAY INVOLVE METHODOLOGIES FOR VALUING INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY

DIFFERENT FROM THE METHODOLOGIES REQUIRED BY CURRENT GAAP. IN JUNE 2012, THE FASB ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT INDICATED THAT BASED ON THE NATURE AND TOTALITY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FASB'S AND IASB'S

VIEWS, IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE TWO BOARDS WILL ACHIEVE CONVERGENCE ON THIS PROJECT. THE FASB FURTHER NOTED THAT THE FASB AND IASB HAVE VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE PROJECT, GIVEN THAT THE U.S.

HAS EXISTING GUIDANCE ON INSURANCE CONTRACTS WHEREAS THERE IS CURRENTLY NO COMPREHENSIVE IFRS INSURANCE STANDARD FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS, IT IS CURRENTLY UNCLEAR WHAT CHANGES, IF

ANY, MAY BE MADE TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS UNDER GAAP AS A RESULT OF THIS PROJECT, AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER WE WILL CHOOSE TO, OR BE REQUIRED TO, ADOPT IFRS OR HOW THE

ADOPTION OF IFRS (OR THE CONVERGENCE OF GAAP AND IFRS, INCLUDING THE PROJECT FOR VALUING INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES) MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FUTURE. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT SPECIFICALLY APPLY TO INSURANCE COMPANY OPERATIONS, MAY IMPACT THE CONTENT AND PRESENTATION OF OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO

OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING LOWER REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND INCREASED VOLATILITY AND DECREASED COMPARABILITY OF OUR REPORTED RESULTS WITH OTHER

INSURERS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR CONTROLS DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS ARE NOT

EFFECTIVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE ON A DAILY BASIS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING, CLAIM PROCESSING AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX. THESE ACTIVITIES OFTEN ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNAL GUIDELINES AND POLICIES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. IF OUR CONTROLS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, IT COULD LEAD TO FINANCIAL LOSS, UNANTICIPATED RISK

EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK) OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

IN

ADDITION, INEFFECTIVE CONTROLS COULD LEAD TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION. THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

AGAINST VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS FOLLOWING THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND MARKET DISRUPTION. SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY

ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT. SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE

INVOLVED.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM

WITHIN THE

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN KEY POSITIONS AND THOSE POSSESSING HIGHLY SPECIALIZED UNDERWRITING

KNOWLEDGE. OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS, EFFORTS AND PROPER CONDUCT OF HIGHLY-SKILLED INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES, MANY OF WHOM HAVE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. SEE "ITEM 10DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE" FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EMPLOYEES, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND REPUTATION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

LOSS OF OR SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN THE PRICING AND UNDERWRITING OF PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE

PROFITABILITY.

IN PERSONAL INSURANCE, WE USE CREDIT SCORING AS A FACTOR IN PRICING DECISIONS WHERE ALLOWED BY STATE LAW. SOME CONSUMER GROUPS AND REGULATORS HAVE

QUESTIONED WHETHER THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH LOW INCOMES, MINORITY GROUPS AND THE ELDERLY AND ARE CALLING FOR THE PROHIBITION OR RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF

CREDIT SCORING IN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING. LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING, IF ENACTED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF STATES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE

PROFITABILITY.
