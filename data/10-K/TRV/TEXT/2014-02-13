TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY) IS A HOLDING COMPANY PRINCIPALLY

ENGAGED, THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, IN PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT UNITS, ASSOCIATIONS AND

INDIVIDUALS. THE COMPANY IS INCORPORATED AS A GENERAL BUSINESS CORPORATION UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA AND IS ONE OF THE OLDEST INSURANCE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, DATING BACK

TO 1853. THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF THE COMPANY ARE LOCATED AT 485 LEXINGTON AVENUE, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10017, AND ITS TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (917) 778-6000. THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS

EXECUTIVE OFFICES IN HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT, AND ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA. THE TERM

"TRV" IN THIS DOCUMENT REFERS TO THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY EXCLUDING SUBSIDIARIES.

FOR

A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND TOTAL ASSETS BY REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE AREAS OF PRICE, SERVICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AGENT

RELATIONSHIPS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION. DISTRIBUTION METHODS INCLUDE THE USE OF INDEPENDENT AGENTS, EXCLUSIVE AGENTS, DIRECT MARKETING (INCLUDING THE USE OF TOLL-FREE NUMBERS AND THE INTERNET)

AND/OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES. ACCORDING TO A.M. BEST, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 1,300 PROPERTY AND CASUALTY GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES, COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 2,750 PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

COMPANIES. OF THOSE GROUPS, THE TOP 150 ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 92% OF THE CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRY'S TOTAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2012. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INSURERS.

IN ADDITION, SEVERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL

INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE, SOME OF WHICH UTILIZE CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS. THE COMPANY'S

COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



PREMIUMS CHARGED;



CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS;



PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED;



CLAIM SERVICE;



AGENT, BROKER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS;



LOCAL PRESENCE;



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS;



OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH;



RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES;



EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES; AND



TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

IN

ADDITION, THE MARKETPLACE IS AFFECTED BY AVAILABLE CAPACITY OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, AS MEASURED BY POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE. INDUSTRY CAPACITY AS

MEASURED BY POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS PRIMARILY IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROFIT LEVELS GENERATED BY THE INDUSTRY, LESS AMOUNTS RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE

REPURCHASES. CAPITAL RAISED BY DEBT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS MAY ALSO INCREASE POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN ESTIMATION OF EXPECTED LOSSES,

THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCING, ISSUING AND SERVICING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY RELATED TO THE EXPECTED LOSS AND EXPENSE CASH FLOWS, AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR

PROFIT THAT CONSIDERS THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. THE COMPANY HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT OVER THE LONG-TERM EMPHASIZES PRODUCT

RETURNS AND PROFITABLE GROWTH RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING RATE AND POLICY FORM APPROVALS. THE

APPLICABLE STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISH STANDARDS IN CERTAIN LINES OF BUSINESS TO ENSURE THAT RATES ARE NOT EXCESSIVE, INADEQUATE, UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY, OR USED TO ENGAGE IN UNFAIR PRICE

COMPETITION. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO INCREASE RATES AND THE RELATIVE TIMING OF THE PROCESS ARE DEPENDENT UPON EACH RESPECTIVE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE COMPETITIVE MARKET ENVIRONMENT.

CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE

THE WIDE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSES IT TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF

CATASTROPHES. THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY AND THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER MODELING PROCESSES, TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR AND ANALYZE UNDERWRITING RISKS OF BUSINESS IN

NATURAL CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS AND TARGET RISK AREAS FOR CONVENTIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS (DEFINED AS ATTACKS OTHER THAN NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS). THE COMPANY RELIES, IN

PART, UPON THIS ANALYSIS TO MAKE UNDERWRITING DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE ON CATASTROPHE-EXPOSED BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY

HAS LIMITED THE WRITING OF NEW PROPERTY AND HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS IN SOME MARKETS AND HAS SELECTIVELY TAKEN UNDERWRITING ACTIONS ON NEW AND EXISTING BUSINESS. THESE UNDERWRITING ACTIONS ON NEW AND

EXISTING BUSINESS INCLUDE TIGHTENED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, SELECTIVE PRICE INCREASES AND CHANGES TO DEDUCTIBLES SPECIFIC TO HURRICANE-, TORNADO-, WIND- AND HAIL-PRONE AREAS. SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING" AND "CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS."

EVALUATED VIA AN AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING PLATFORM WHICH IN TURN ENABLES AGENTS TO QUOTE, BIND AND ISSUE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF NEW SMALL BUSINESS RISKS AT THEIR DESKTOP IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER THAT

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN QUOTING A PRICE ON A NEW POLICY AND ISSUING THAT POLICY. RISKS WITH MORE COMPLEX CHARACTERISTICS ARE UNDERWRITTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF COMPANY

PERSONNEL. THE AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING PLATFORM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY STREAMLINED

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS INSURANCE UTILIZES UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINES FOR PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES,

IN CONJUNCTION WITH EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS OF PROPRIETARY DATA GATHERED AND ANALYZED OVER MANY YEARS, TO FACILITATE ITS RISK SELECTION PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING PARAMETERS. THE COMPANY UTILIZES BOTH

STANDARD INDUSTRY FORMS AND PROPRIETARY FORMS FOR THE INSURANCE POLICIES IT ISSUES.

A

PORTION OF BUSINESS IN THIS SEGMENT, PARTICULARLY IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSTRUCTION, IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE

CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT

AND IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK UNTIL SUCH REIMBURSEMENT IS MADE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES ON UNPAID

LOSSES WITHIN THE DEDUCTIBLE LAYER OF LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES AND THE ASSOCIATED RECEIVABLES WERE EACH APPROXIMATELY $4.31 BILLION. BUSINESS INSURANCE ALSO UTILIZES RETROSPECTIVELY RATED

POLICIES FOR ANOTHER PORTION OF THE BUSINESS, PRIMARILY FOR WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGE. ALTHOUGH THE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED FEATURE OF THE POLICY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES INSURANCE RISK FOR THE

COMPANY, IT INTRODUCES ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY. PREMIUM RECEIVABLES FROM HOLDERS OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $99 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013.

SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CASH COLLATERAL OR TRUSTS, IS GENERALLY OBTAINED FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PLANS AND/OR RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES THAT

PROVIDE FOR DEFERRED COLLECTION OF DEDUCTIBLE RECOVERIES AND/OR ULTIMATE PREMIUMS. THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL REQUESTED IS PREDICATED UPON THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER AND THE NATURE OF THE

INSURED RISKS. BUSINESS INSURANCE CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE CREDIT EXPOSURE ON INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS AND THE ADEQUACY OF COLLATERAL.

PRODUCT LINES

THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT WRITES THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF COVERAGES.



WORKERS'

COMPENSATION.

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYERS FOR SPECIFIED BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW FOR WORKPLACE INJURIES TO

COMPETITION

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS REPRESENTED IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE BY MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZE AS WELL AS OTHER

ENTITIES OFFERING RISK ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS OR CAPTIVE PROGRAMS. MARKET COMPETITION WORKS WITHIN THE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO SET THE PRICE CHARGED FOR INSURANCE

PRODUCTS AND THE LEVELS OF COVERAGE AND SERVICE PROVIDED. A COMPANY'S SUCCESS IN THE COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE LANDSCAPE IS LARGELY MEASURED BY ITS ABILITY TO PROFITABLY PROVIDE INSURANCE AND

SERVICES, INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING AND RISK CONTROL, AT PRICES AND TERMS THAT RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITORS

TYPICALLY WRITE SELECT ACCOUNTS BUSINESS THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS AND DIRECT WRITERS. BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE IN THE SELECT ACCOUNTS MARKET WHICH GENERALLY COMPRISES LOWER-HAZARD, "MAIN STREET" BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. RISKS ARE UNDERWRITTEN AND PRICED USING STANDARD INDUSTRY

PRACTICES AND A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRODUCT OFFERINGS. COMPETITION IN THIS MARKET IS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRODUCT OFFERINGS, SERVICE LEVELS, EASE OF DOING BUSINESS AND

PRICE.

COMPETITORS

TYPICALLY WRITE COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

COMPANIES THAT WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND PRICING, AND REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES.

COMPANIES COMPETE BASED ON PRODUCT OFFERINGS, SERVICE LEVELS, PRICE AND CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES. EFFICIENCY THROUGH AUTOMATION AND RAPID RESPONSE TIME TO CUSTOMER NEEDS IS ONE KEY TO

SUCCESS IN THIS MARKET.

IN

THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS MARKET, COMPETITION IS BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES, MANAGED CARE COST CONTAINMENT, RISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY COMPETES WITH NATIONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS WITH OTHER UNDERWRITERS OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE IN THE

ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER MARKET, SUCH AS SELF-INSURANCE PLANS, CAPTIVES MANAGED BY OTHERS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER RISK-FINANCING VEHICLES AND MECHANISMS. THE RESIDUAL MARKET DIVISION COMPETES FOR

STATE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THERE

ARE SEVERAL OTHER BUSINESS GROUPS IN BUSINESS INSURANCE THAT COMPETE IN FOCUSED TARGET MARKETS. EACH OF THESE MARKETS IS DIFFERENT AND REQUIRES UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF INDUSTRY

KNOWLEDGE, CUSTOMIZED COVERAGE, SPECIALIZED RISK CONTROL AND LOSS HANDLING SERVICES, ALONG WITH PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENTS AND BROKERS THAT ALSO FOCUS ON THESE MARKETS. SOME OF THESE BUSINESS GROUPS

COMPETE WITH NATIONAL CARRIERS WITH SIMILARLY DEDICATED UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING GROUPS, WHEREAS OTHERS COMPETE WITH SMALLER REGIONAL COMPANIES. EACH OF THESE BUSINESS GROUPS HAS REGIONAL STRUCTURES

THAT ALLOW THEM TO DELIVER PERSONALIZED SERVICE AND LOCAL KNOWLEDGE TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. SPECIALIZED AGENTS AND BROKERS, INCLUDING WHOLESALE AGENTS AND PROGRAM MANAGERS, SUPPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY.

IN ALL OF THESE BUSINESS GROUPS, THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY TYPICALLY IS THE APPLICATION OF FOCUSED INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE TO INSURANCE AND RISK NEEDS.

COMPETITION

THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE IN WHICH BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS OPERATES IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS DESCRIBED

PREVIOUSLY FOR THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL

PRODUCTS AND PRICING AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMPANIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED NICHE PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

BOND &

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS UNDERWRITES AND MARKETS ITS PRODUCTS TO ALL SIZES OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS REPUTATION

FOR TIMELY AND CONSISTENT DECISION MAKING, A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCAL UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS AND INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND STRONG PRODUCER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AS WELL AS ITS ABILITY TO OFFER ITS

CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE OF PRODUCTS, PROVIDES BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AN ADVANTAGE OVER MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS AND ENABLES IT TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN A COMPLEX, DYNAMIC MARKETPLACE. THE

PRINCIPAL MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION

PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 11,500 ACTIVE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE

UNITED STATES, SUPPORTED BY PERSONNEL IN TEN SALES REGIONS AND SEVEN SERVICE CENTERS. WHILE THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO BE IN STATES ALONG THE EAST COAST,

CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS, THE BUSINESS CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. SEE "COMPETITION" BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S NEW PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE

PRODUCT, QUANTUM AUTO 2.0.

IN

SELECTING NEW INDEPENDENT AGENCIES TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, PERSONAL INSURANCE CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER ATTRIBUTES, EACH AGENCY'S PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL STABILITY, STAFF EXPERIENCE

AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH THE SEGMENT'S OPERATING AND MARKETING PLANS. ONCE AN AGENCY IS APPOINTED, PERSONAL INSURANCE CAREFULLY MONITORS ITS PERFORMANCE.

AGENTS

CAN ACCESS THE COMPANY'S AGENCY SERVICE PORTAL FOR A NUMBER OF RESOURCES INCLUDING CUSTOMER SERVICE, MARKETING AND CLAIMS MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, AGENCIES CAN CHOOSE TO SHIFT THE

ONGOING SERVICE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE'S CUSTOMERS TO ONE OF THE COMPANY'S FIVE CUSTOMER CARE CENTERS, WHERE THE COMPANY PROVIDES, ON BEHALF OF AN AGENCY, A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF

CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS, INCLUDING RESPONSE TO BILLING AND COVERAGE INQUIRIES, AND POLICY CHANGES. APPROXIMATELY 1,700 AGENTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SERVICE ALTERNATIVE.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE ALSO DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH ADDITIONAL CHANNELS, INCLUDING CORPORATIONS THAT MAKE THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS AVAILABLE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES PRIMARILY

THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTION, CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS AND AFFINITY GROUPS. PERSONAL INSURANCE HANDLES THE SALES AND SERVICE FOR THESE PROGRAMS EITHER THROUGH A SPONSORING INDEPENDENT AGENT OR THROUGH TWO

OF THE COMPANY'S CALL CENTER LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION, SINCE 1995, THE COMPANY HAS HAD A MARKETING AGREEMENT WITH GEICO TO UNDERWRITE HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS FOR CERTAIN OF THEIR AUTO CUSTOMERS.

IN

2009, THE COMPANY BEGAN MARKETING ITS INSURANCE PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS, LARGELY THROUGH ONLINE CHANNELS. THE INVESTMENT IN THE DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER INITIATIVE GENERATED MODEST

PREMIUM VOLUME FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE IN RECENT YEARS, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS. HOWEVER, THE DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER INITIATIVE, WHILE INTENDED TO ENHANCE THE COMPANY'S

LONG-TERM ABILITY TO

COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN A CONSUMER-DRIVEN MARKETPLACE, IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNPROFITABLE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AS THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP, TEST AND EVALUATE THIS DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PERSONAL INSURANCE HAS DEVELOPED A PRODUCT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT INTEGRATES THE DISCIPLINES OF UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, ACTUARIAL AND

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAINTAIN

HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING DISCIPLINE AND PRICING SEGMENTATION. PROPRIETARY DATA ACCUMULATED OVER MANY YEARS IS ANALYZED AND PERSONAL INSURANCE USES A VARIETY OF RISK DIFFERENTIATION MODELS TO

FACILITATE ITS PRICING SEGMENTATION. THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT MANAGEMENT AREA ESTABLISHES UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES INTEGRATED WITH ITS FILED PRICING AND RATING PLANS, WHICH ENABLE PERSONAL INSURANCE TO

EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE ITS RISK SELECTION AND PRICING PROCESSES.

PRICING

FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE IS DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF AUTOMOBILE REPAIRS, MEDICAL CARE AND LITIGATION OF

LIABILITY CLAIMS. PRICING IN THE HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS IS DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF BUILDING SUPPLIES, LABOR AND HOUSEHOLD POSSESSIONS.

IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY MULTIPLE PERIL COVERAGE, THE PROFITABILITY AND PRICING OF BOTH HOMEOWNERS AND AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE ARE AFFECTED BY THE INCIDENCE OF NATURAL

DISASTERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO WEATHER AND, FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE, EARTHQUAKES. INSURERS WRITING PERSONAL LINES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES MAY BE UNABLE TO INCREASE PRICES UNTIL SOME

TIME AFTER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COVERAGE HAVE INCREASED, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF STATE INSURANCE RATE REGULATION. THE PACE AT WHICH AN INSURER CAN CHANGE RATES IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED COSTS

DEPENDS, IN PART, ON WHETHER THE APPLICABLE STATE LAW REQUIRES PRIOR APPROVAL OF RATE INCREASES OR NOTIFICATION TO THE REGULATOR EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER A RATE CHANGE IS IMPOSED. IN STATES WITH PRIOR

APPROVAL LAWS, RATES MUST BE APPROVED BY THE REGULATOR BEFORE BEING USED BY THE INSURER. IN STATES HAVING "FILE-AND-USE" LAWS, THE INSURER MUST FILE RATE CHANGES WITH THE REGULATOR, BUT DOES NOT NEED

TO WAIT FOR APPROVAL BEFORE USING THE NEW RATES. A "USE-AND-FILE" LAW REQUIRES AN INSURER TO FILE RATES WITHIN A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE INSURER BEGINS USING THE NEW RATE. APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF

THE STATES REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL OF MOST RATE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES TO METHODS OF MARKETING AND UNDERWRITING IN SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO STATE-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, WHICH CAN MAKE IT

MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN INSURER TO SIGNIFICANTLY MANAGE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES.

THE

COMPANY'S ABILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO RAISE PRICES, MODIFY UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCE EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND/OR CHANGES IN THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE. THE COMPANY ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE WRITE IN SOME STATES

FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING ACCESS TO OTHER COMMERCIAL OR PERSONAL UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES. IN CHOOSING TO WRITE BUSINESS IN SOME STATES, THE COMPANY ALSO CONSIDERS THE COSTS AND

BENEFITS OF THOSE STATES' RESIDUAL MARKETS AND GUARANTY FUNDS, AS WELL AS OTHER PROPERTY AND CASUALTY BUSINESS THE COMPANY WRITES IN THOSE STATES.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE UTILIZES TECHNOLOGY INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE INDEPENDENT AGENTS' EASE OF DOING BUSINESS WITH THE COMPANY. AUTOMATED QUOTE TRANSACTIONS CAN BE SUBMITTED ONLINE BY

INDEPENDENT AGENTS EITHER THROUGH PERSONAL INSURANCE'S PROPRIETARY PLATFORM, THEIR OWN AGENCY MANAGEMENT PLATFORM OR COMPARATIVE RATERS (DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "COMPETITION" SECTION THAT

FOLLOWS). NEARLY ALL NEW BUSINESS POLICIES CAN BE ISSUED ONLINE EITHER BY USING THE AGENTS' OWN PLATFORM OR PERSONAL INSURANCE'S PLATFORM, BOTH OF WHICH INTERFACE WITH PERSONAL INSURANCE'S

UNDERWRITING AND RATING SYSTEMS TO MONITOR TRANSACTIONS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANY'S UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PROGRAMS. ALL ON-LINE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO CONSULTATIVE REVIEW BY PERSONAL

INSURANCE'S IN-HOUSE UNDERWRITERS. AUDITS OF ON-LINE BUSINESS ARE CONDUCTED BY AN INTERNAL REVIEW TEAM USING SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING ACROSS ALL OF THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

PRODUCT LINES

THE PRIMARY COVERAGES IN PERSONAL INSURANCE ARE PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER INSURANCE SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS. PERSONAL

INSURANCE HAD APPROXIMATELY 6.4 MILLION ACTIVE POLICIES (E.G., POLICIES-IN-FORCE) AT DECEMBER 31, 2013.

17

COMPETITION

ALTHOUGH NATIONAL COMPANIES WRITE THE MAJORITY OF THIS BUSINESS, PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM MANY REGIONAL AND

HUNDREDS OF LOCAL COMPANIES. PERSONAL INSURANCE PRIMARILY COMPETES BASED ON BREADTH OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PRICE, SERVICE (INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING), EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, STABILITY OF THE INSURER

AND NAME RECOGNITION. PERSONAL INSURANCE COMPETES FOR BUSINESS WITHIN EACH INDEPENDENT AGENCY SINCE THESE AGENCIES ALSO OFFER POLICIES OF COMPETING COMPANIES. AT THE AGENCY LEVEL, COMPETITION IS

PRIMARILY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE (INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING), THE LEVEL OF AUTOMATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIVIDUAL AGENTS. IN RECENT YEARS, MOST INDEPENDENT PERSONAL

INSURANCE AGENTS HAVE BEGUN UTILIZING PRICE COMPARISON RATING TECHNOLOGY, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS "COMPARATIVE RATERS," AS A COST-EFFICIENT MEANS OF OBTAINING QUOTES FROM MULTIPLE COMPANIES. BECAUSE

THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY FACILITATES THE PROCESS OF GENERATING MULTIPLE QUOTES, THE TECHNOLOGY HAS INCREASED PRICE COMPARISON ON NEW BUSINESS AND, INCREASINGLY, ON RENEWAL BUSINESS. PERSONAL

INSURANCE ALSO COMPETES WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT USE EXCLUSIVE AGENTS OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THOSE THAT EMPLOY DIRECT MARKETING STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THE USE OF

TOLL-FREE NUMBERS AND THE INTERNET. SEE "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSTHE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES

AND OUR PROFITABILITY."

THE

AGENCY AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE USE OF PRICE COMPARISON TECHNOLOGY BY AGENTS AND BROKERS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE

COMPANY HAS UNDERTAKEN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO REDUCE COSTS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE UNDERWRITING MARGINS AND ENABLE IT TO HAVE A MORE COMPETITIVELY-PRICED PRODUCT. THE COMPANY'S ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THESE

FACTORS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REDUCTION OF CERTAIN CLAIM ADJUSTMENT AND OTHER INSURANCE EXPENSES, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE IMPACT IN THE AGENCY AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS. THE REDUCTION IS

INTENDED TO RESULT IN SAVINGS OF $140 MILLION PRE-TAX PER YEAR BY 2015 WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED. IT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION,

$12 MILLION OF WHICH WAS INCURRED IN 2013. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED A NEW PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT, QUANTUM AUTO 2.0. THIS PRODUCT, IN

ADDITION TO INCORPORATING THE COST SAVINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE, HAS A LOWER BASE COMMISSION RATE THAN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING QUANTUM AUTO 1.0 PRODUCT. THESE CHANGES IN COST STRUCTURE ARE INTENDED TO

ENABLE THE COMPANY TO PRICE QUANTUM AUTO 2.0 MORE COMPETITIVELY WHILE GENERATING AN APPROPRIATE RETURN. THE NEW PRODUCT WAS LAUNCHED IN 18 STATES BY THE END OF 2013 AND IS EXPECTED TO BE OFFERED IN

ALL BUT THREE STATES BEFORE THE END OF 2014. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY INTENDS THAT, IN APPROVED STATES, ALL NEW ACCOUNTS WILL BE ON QUANTUM AUTO 2.0. IN ADDITION, QUANTUM AUTO 2.0 WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE

TO AGENTS AT THEIR DISCRETION FOR EXISTING ACCOUNTS.

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY'S CLAIM FUNCTIONS ARE MANAGED THROUGH ITS CLAIMS SERVICES OPERATION, WITH LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE

COUNTRIES WHERE IT DOES BUSINESS. WITH MORE THAN 12,000 EMPLOYEES, CLAIMS SERVICES EMPLOYS A DIVERSE GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS, INCLUDING CLAIM ADJUSTERS, APPRAISERS, ATTORNEYS, INVESTIGATORS, ENGINEERS,

ACCOUNTANTS, SYSTEM SPECIALISTS AND TRAINING,

MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL. APPROVED EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS INVESTIGATORS, ATTORNEYS AND, IN THE RARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN NECESSARY, INDEPENDENT ADJUSTERS AND APPRAISERS, ARE

AVAILABLE FOR USE AS APPROPRIATE.

U.S.

FIELD CLAIM MANAGEMENT TEAMS LOCATED IN 21 CLAIM CENTERS AND 57 SATELLITE AND SPECIALTY-ONLY OFFICES IN 45 STATES ARE ORGANIZED TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC CLAIM

CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE TO THE BUSINESSES WITHIN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS SEGMENTS. CLAIM TEAMS WITH SPECIALIZED SKILLS, REQUIRED LICENSES, RESOURCES AND WORKFLOWS ARE MATCHED TO THE UNIQUE EXPOSURES OF

THOSE BUSINESSES, WITH LOCAL CLAIMS MANAGEMENT DEDICATED TO ACHIEVING OPTIMAL RESULTS WITHIN EACH SEGMENT. THE COMPANY'S HOME OFFICE OPERATIONS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF WORKFLOW

DESIGN, QUALITY MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCED MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS, TRAINING, FINANCIAL

REPORTING

AND CONTROL, AND HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY. THIS STRUCTURE PERMITS THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF A LARGE, ESTABLISHED COMPANY WHILE RETAINING THE AGILITY TO RESPOND

PROMPTLY TO THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS, BROKERS, AGENTS AND UNDERWRITERS. CLAIMS MANAGEMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL, WHILE GENERALLY PROVIDED LOCALLY BY STAFF IN THE RESPECTIVE INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS DUE TO

LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IS ALSO MANAGED BY THE COMPANY'S U.S. CLAIMS SERVICES ORGANIZATION TO LEVERAGE THAT KNOWLEDGE BASE AND TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES.

AN

INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY TO BENEFIT CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS IS ITS CONTINUING INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INSURANCE FRAUD THROUGH ITS INVESTIGATIVE

SERVICES UNIT. THE COMPANY HAS A NATIONWIDE STAFF OF EXPERTS WHO INVESTIGATE A WIDE ARRAY OF INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEMES USING IN-HOUSE FORENSIC RESOURCES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS. THIS STAFF ALSO

HAS SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE IN FIRE SCENE EXAMINATIONS, MEDICAL PROVIDER FRAUD SCHEMES AND DATA MINING. THE COMPANY ALSO DEDICATES INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT VIOLATIONS OF LAW ARE REPORTED

TO AND PROSECUTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

CLAIMS

SERVICES USES TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS TO ASSIST THE COMPANY IN REVIEWING ITS CLAIM PRACTICES AND RESULTS IN ORDER TO EVALUATE AND IMPROVE ITS CLAIMS

MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON SEGMENTATION OF CLAIMS AND APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL SPECIALIZATION TO DRIVE EFFECTIVE CLAIM RESOLUTION. THE COMPANY

CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS INVESTMENT IN CLAIM RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE FOCUS ON CLAIM OUTCOMES AND A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT. THE COMPANY OPERATES A STATE-OF-THE-ART

CLAIMS TRAINING FACILITY, OFFERING HANDS-ON EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING TO HELP ENSURE THAT ITS CLAIM PROFESSIONALS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED. IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL

RESOURCES IN MANY OF ITS CLAIM HANDLING OPERATIONS AND ROUTINELY MONITORS THE EFFECT OF THOSE INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE A CONSISTENT OPTIMIZATION AMONG OUTCOMES, COST AND SERVICE.

CLAIMS

SERVICES' CATASTROPHE RESPONSE STRATEGY IS TO RESPOND TO A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHIC EVENT USING ITS OWN PERSONNEL, ENABLING IT TO MINIMIZE RELIANCE ON INDEPENDENT ADJUSTERS AND

APPRAISERS. THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED A LARGE DEDICATED CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM AND TRAINED A LARGE ENTERPRISE RESPONSE TEAM OF EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHO CAN BE DEPLOYED ON SHORT NOTICE IN THE EVENT OF

A CATASTROPHE THAT GENERATES CLAIM VOLUME EXCEEDING THE CAPACITY OF THE DEDICATED CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM. IN RECENT YEARS, THESE INTERNAL RESOURCES WERE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED TO RESPOND TO A RECORD

NUMBER OF CATASTROPHE CLAIMS.

REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY REINSURES A PORTION OF THE RISKS IT UNDERWRITES IN ORDER TO CONTROL ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES. THE COMPANY CEDES TO REINSURERS

A PORTION OF THESE RISKS AND PAYS PREMIUMS BASED UPON THE RISK AND EXPOSURE OF THE POLICIES SUBJECT TO SUCH REINSURANCE. CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES CREDIT RISK, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO MANDATORY POOLS

AND ASSOCIATIONS, AND IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF THE REINSURANCE CEDED, THE COMPANY REMAINS LIABLE AS THE DIRECT

INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED AFTER REDUCTIONS FOR KNOWN INSOLVENCIES AND AFTER ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS COLLATERAL,

INCLUDING TRUST AGREEMENTS, ESCROW FUNDS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, UNDER CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF REINSURERS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND REVIEWS ITS

REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS PERIODICALLY. REINSURERS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES, THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL PROVIDED. AFTER

REINSURANCE IS PURCHASED, THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED ABILITY TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK TO A REINSURER. IN ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A

REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE

APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONCERNING

REINSURANCE, SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS."

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LARGE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY LOSSES, INCLUDING.



FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE INSURANCE PROVIDED BY A SINGLE

POLICY AND EACH POLICY REINSURED IS SEPARATELY NEGOTIATED;



QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR AN AGREED-UPON FIXED PERCENTAGE OF LIABILITIES, PREMIUMS AND

LOSSES FOR EACH POLICY COVERED ON A PRO RATA BASIS;



TREATY REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR A SPECIFIED TYPE OR CATEGORY OF RISKS; AND



CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE, IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INDEMNIFIED FOR AN AMOUNT OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED RETENTION WITH

RESPECT TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM A CATASTROPHIC EVENT.

FOR

A DESCRIPTION OF REINSURANCE-RELATED LITIGATION, SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS, WHICH ARE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SETTLE CERTAIN PERSONAL

PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE THE COMPANY DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE AMOUNT DUE FROM THE LIFE

INSURANCE COMPANY RELATED TO THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS A REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE AND THE RELATED CLAIM COST IS INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY FOR

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, AS THE COMPANY RETAINS THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IF IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PAY, THE COMPANY WOULD

RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF THE RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE IF, AND TO THE EXTENT, THE PURCHASED ANNUITIES ARE NOT COVERED BY STATE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE

COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS.

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY A VARIETY OF EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HURRICANES, TORNADOES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES,

HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER,

FLOODS, TSUNAMIS AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO RESULT FROM A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS), EXPLOSIONS,

INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES OR AS A CONSEQUENCE OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF

BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS; HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND

EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL

RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY WITH UNAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM

CATASTROPHES. IN ADDITION TO THE COVERAGE PROVIDED UNDER THIS TREATY, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES CATASTROPHE BONDS, AS WELL AS A NORTHEAST CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY, TO PROTECT AGAINST CERTAIN

LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ALSO HAS A GENERAL CATASTROPHE AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATY, TWO EARTHQUAKE EXCESS-OF-LOSS

REINSURANCE TREATIES AND SEVERAL REINSURANCE TREATIES SPECIFIC TO ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY WITH UNAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO

HELP MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES. THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY COVERS THE ACCUMULATION OF NET PROPERTY LOSSES ARISING OUT OF ONE OCCURRENCE. THE TREATY COVERS ALL OF THE

COMPANY'S EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA AND THEIR POSSESSIONS, AND WATERS CONTIGUOUS THERETO, THE CARIBBEAN AND MEXICO. THE TREATY ONLY PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR TERRORISM EVENTS IN LIMITED

CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXCLUDES ENTIRELY LOSSES ARISING FROM NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL ATTACKS.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPANY'S COVERAGE UNDER ITS GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY, EFFECTIVE FOR THE PERIOD JULY 1, 2013 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2014, AS WELL

AS CERTAIN OTHER CATASTROPHE-RELATED COVERAGES, OTHER THAN COVERAGE RELATED TO THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS TREATY WHICH IS DESCRIBED LATER IN THIS SECTION.

CATASTROPHE BONDS.

THE COMPANY HAS CATASTROPHE PROTECTION THROUGH TWO INDEMNITY REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH LONG POINT RE III LTD.

(LONG POINT

RE III), AN INDEPENDENT CAYMAN ISLANDS COMPANY LICENSED AS A CLASS B INSURER IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS. THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS EXPIRE IN JUNE 2015 AND MAY 2016, RESPECTIVELY. BOTH REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS MEET THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS REINSURANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE FOR REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. IN CONNECTION WITH EACH REINSURANCE AGREEMENT, LONG POINT RE III ISSUED

NOTES (GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS "CATASTROPHE BONDS") TO INVESTORS IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FULL COVERAGE PROVIDED UNDER THE RESPECTIVE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

ON

JUNE 6, 2012, LONG POINT RE III COMPLETED AN OFFERING TO UNRELATED INVESTORS OF $250 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF CATASTROPHE BONDS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

OFFERING, THE COMPANY AND LONG POINT RE III ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR REINSURANCE AGREEMENT PROVIDING COVERAGE TO THE COMPANY FOR CERTAIN LOSSES FROM A HURRICANE IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THE

BUSINESS COVERED BY THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT COMPRISES SPECIFIED PROPERTY AND RELATED COVERAGES IN THE COMPANY'S PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, AND WITHIN THE "SELECT ACCOUNTS" AND THE "COMMERCIAL

ACCOUNTS" BUSINESS GROUPS WITHIN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT. COVERED LOSSES UNDER THE AGREEMENT ARE LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS: CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE, DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA, MAINE, MARYLAND, MASSACHUSETTS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, PENNSYLVANIA, RHODE ISLAND, VIRGINIA AND VERMONT. THE PROCEEDS OF THE OFFERING WERE DEPOSITED IN A REINSURANCE TRUST

ACCOUNT. THE ATTACHMENT POINT, MAXIMUM LIMIT AND INSURANCE PERCENTAGE ARE RESET ANNUALLY TO MAINTAIN MODELED PROBABILITIES OF ATTACHMENT AND EXPECTED LOSS ON THE RESPECTIVE CATASTROPHE BONDS EQUAL TO

THE INITIAL MODELED

PROBABILITIES OF ATTACHMENT AND EXPECTED LOSS. THE ATTACHMENT POINT, MAXIMUM LIMIT AND INSURANCE PERCENTAGE WERE RESET IN APRIL 2013. ACCORDINGLY, FOR THE PERIOD MAY 1, 2013 THROUGH

APRIL 30, 2014,

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY WILL BE ENTITLED TO BEGIN RECOVERING AMOUNTS UNDER THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT IF THE LOSSES IN THE COVERED AREA FOR A SINGLE OCCURRENCE REACH AN INITIAL ATTACHMENT AMOUNT OF

$1.817 BILLION. THE FULL $250 MILLION COVERAGE AMOUNT IS AVAILABLE ON A PROPORTIONAL BASIS UNTIL COVERED LOSSES REACH A MAXIMUM $2.427 BILLION.

ON

MAY 16, 2013, LONG POINT RE III COMPLETED A SECOND OFFERING TO UNRELATED INVESTORS OF $300 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF CATASTROPHE BONDS. IN CONNECTION WITH

THE OFFERING, THE COMPANY AND LONG POINT RE III ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR REINSURANCE AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR COVERAGE UP TO $300 MILLION FOR LOSSES FROM A NORTHEAST HURRICANE. THE BUSINESS

COVERED BY THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT IS A SUBSET OF THE COMPANY'S OVERALL INSURANCE PORTFOLIO, COMPRISING PROPERTY INSURANCE AND RELATED COVERAGES SPREAD ACROSS THE FOLLOWING GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS.

CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, MAINE, MARYLAND, MASSACHUSETTS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, PENNSYLVANIA, RHODE ISLAND, VIRGINIA AND VERMONT. THE COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO SPECIFIED

PROPERTY COVERAGE WRITTEN IN THE COMPANY'S PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, AND WITHIN THE "SELECT ACCOUNTS" AND THE "COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS" MARKET GROUPS WITHIN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT.

COVERAGE UNDER THE AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO LOSSES FROM HURRICANES AND IS INITIALLY SUBJECT TO A $1.25 BILLION RETENTION PER OCCURRENCE, AFTER WHICH THE COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO RECOVER UP TO

$300 MILLION ON A PROPORTIONAL BASIS UNTIL COVERED LOSSES REACH A MAXIMUM $1.80 BILLION LIMIT. THE ATTACHMENT POINT AND MAXIMUM LIMIT WILL BE RESET ANNUALLY, WITH THE ABILITY OF THE

COMPANY TO ADJUST THE EXPECTED LOSS OF THE COVERAGE LAYER (THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ATTACHMENT POINT AND THE MAXIMUM LIMIT) WITHIN A PREDETERMINED RANGE. SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ARRANGEMENT WITH LONG

POINT RE III, THE PROCEEDS OF THE OFFERING WERE DEPOSITED IN A SEPARATE REINSURANCE TRUST ACCOUNT.

UNDER

THE TERMS OF BOTH REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY ANNUAL REINSURANCE PREMIUMS TO LONG POINT RE III FOR THE REINSURANCE COVERAGE. AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THE

COMPANY UNDER BOTH REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY COVERED EVENT CANNOT EXCEED THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL LOSSES FROM SUCH EVENT. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE RESPECTIVE CATASTROPHE BOND WILL BE

REDUCED BY ANY AMOUNTS PAID TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE RESPECTIVE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT.

AS

WITH ANY REINSURANCE AGREEMENT, THERE IS CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTING AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS. WITH REGARD TO LONG POINT RE III, THE CREDIT RISK IS MITIGATED BY

REINSURANCE TRUST ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY LONG POINT RE III WITH MONEY MARKET FUNDS THAT INVEST SOLELY IN DIRECT GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS BACKED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH

MATURITIES OF NO MORE THAN 13 MONTHS. THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS MUST HAVE A PRINCIPAL STABILITY RATING OF AT LEAST AAAM BY STANDARD & POOR'S ON THE ISSUANCE DATE OF THE BONDS AND THEREAFTER

MUST BE RATED BY STANDARD & POOR'S. OTHER PERMISSIBLE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MONEY MARKET FUNDS WHICH INVEST IN REPURCHASE AND REVERSE

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY DIRECT GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS OF ANY AGENCY BACKED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH TERMS OF NO MORE THAN 397 CALENDAR DAYS, AND CASH.

AT

THE TIME THE AGREEMENTS WERE ENTERED INTO WITH LONG POINT RE III, THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT ADDRESSES VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES OR VIES.

UNDER THIS GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY THAT IS FORMED FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES IS CONSIDERED A VIE IF: (A) THE EQUITY INVESTORS LACK THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT ABILITY THROUGH VOTING RIGHTS OR SIMILAR RIGHTS

TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT AN ENTITY'S ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENTITY'S OPERATIONS, OR (B) THE EQUITY INVESTORS DO NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR THE

ENTITY TO SUPPORT ITS ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONALLY, A COMPANY THAT ABSORBS A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES FROM A VIE'S ACTIVITIES OR IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE ENTITY'S EXPECTED RESIDUAL

RETURNS, OR BOTH, IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE VIE AND IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS

A RESULT OF THE EVALUATION OF THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH LONG POINT RE III, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS A VIE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN ITEMS (A) AND

(B) ABOVE WERE PRESENT. HOWEVER, WHILE LONG POINT RE III WAS DETERMINED TO BE A VIE, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT IT DID NOT HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST IN THE ENTITY, AS THE VARIABILITY IN ITS

RESULTS, CAUSED BY THE REINSURANCE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AGREEMENTS,

IS EXPECTED TO BE ABSORBED ENTIRELY BY THE INVESTORS IN THE CATASTROPHE BONDS ISSUED BY LONG POINT RE III AND RESIDUAL AMOUNTS EARNED BY IT, IF ANY, ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABSORBED BY THE

EQUITY INVESTORS (THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER AN EQUITY NOR A RESIDUAL INTEREST IN LONG POINT RE III).

ACCORDINGLY,

THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF LONG POINT RE III AND DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THAT ENTITY IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY,

BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NO INTENTION TO PURSUE ANY TRANSACTION THAT WOULD RESULT IN IT ACQUIRING INTEREST IN AND BECOMING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF LONG POINT RE III, THE CONSOLIDATION OF THAT ENTITY

IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS IS UNLIKELY.

THE

COMPANY HAS NOT INCURRED ANY LOSSES THAT HAVE RESULTED OR ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A RECOVERY UNDER THE LONG POINT RE III AGREEMENTS SINCE THEIR INCEPTION.

NORTHEAST GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY.

IN ADDITION TO ITS GENERAL CATASTROPHE TREATY AND ITS MULTI-YEAR CATASTROPHE BONDS,

THE COMPANY

ALSO IS PARTY TO A NORTHEAST GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY WHICH PROVIDES UP TO $600 MILLION OF COVERAGE, SUBJECT TO A $2.25 BILLION RETENTION, FOR CERTAIN

LOSSES ARISING FROM HURRICANES, TORNADOS, HAIL STORMS, EARTHQUAKES AND WINTER STORM OR FREEZE LOSSES FROM VIRGINIA TO MAINE FOR THE PERIOD JULY 1, 2013 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2014. LOSSES FROM

A COVERED EVENT (OCCURRING OVER SEVERAL DAYS) ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, THE CARIBBEAN AND MEXICO AND WATERS CONTIGUOUS THERETO MAY BE USED TO SATISFY THE RETENTION. RECOVERIES UNDER THE

CATASTROPHE BONDS (IF ANY) WOULD BE FIRST APPLIED TO REDUCE LOSSES SUBJECT TO THIS TREATY.

GENERAL CATASTROPHE AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATY.

FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2014 TO DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE

COMPANY HAS

ENTERED INTO A REINSURANCE AGREEMENT THAT COVERS THE ACCUMULATION OF CERTAIN PROPERTY LOSSES ARISING FROM MULTIPLE OCCURRENCES. FOR EACH OCCURRENCE, QUALIFYING LOSSES ARE 90% OF $1.4 BILLION IN

EXCESS OF $100 MILLION. THE TREATY COVERS AGGREGATE QUALIFYING LOSSES DURING 2014 FOR 40% OF $1.0 BILLION IN EXCESS OF $1.5 BILLION. THE TREATY COVERS ALL OF THE COMPANY'S

EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA AND THEIR POSSESSIONS, AND WATERS CONTIGUOUS THERETO, THE CARIBBEAN AND MEXICO.

BUSINESS INSURANCE EARTHQUAKE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATY.

FOR THE PERIOD JULY 1, 2013 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2014, THE

COMPANY HAS

ENTERED INTO AN EARTHQUAKE EXCESS-OF-LOSS TREATY THAT PROVIDES FOR UP TO $200 MILLION OF COVERAGE, SUBJECT TO A $160 MILLION RETENTION, FOR LOSSES ARISING FROM AN EARTHQUAKE, INCLUDING

FIRE FOLLOWING AND SPRINKLER LEAKAGE INCURRED UNDER POLICIES WRITTEN BY THE NATIONAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC SECTOR BUSINESS UNITS AND THE COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS MARKET GROUP.

PERSONAL INSURANCE EARTHQUAKE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATY.

FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2014 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2014,

INCLUDING FIRE FOLLOWING AND SPRINKLER LEAKAGE INCURRED UNDER POLICIES WRITTEN BY THE COMPANY'S PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT.

DOMINION PROPERTY AND AUTOMOBILE PHYSICAL DAMAGE CATASTROPHE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE CONTRACT.

THIS CONTRACT, EFFECTIVE FOR THE

PERIOD

JANUARY 1, 2014 THROUGH AND INCLUDING JUNE 30, 2014, COVERS THE ACCUMULATION OF NET PROPERTY LOSSES ARISING OUT OF ONE OCCURRENCE WHICH MAY ACCRUE TO DOMINION. THE TREATY COVERS ALL OF

DOMINION'S HABITATIONAL PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND AUTO PHYSICAL DAMAGES EXPOSURES WITH RESPECT TO RISKS LOCATED IN CANADA, WRITTEN FOR CANADIAN INSUREDS, INCLUDING SUCH INSUREDS' INTERESTS

ABROAD. THE TREATY PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR 100% OF LOSS RETAINED BY DOMINION IN EXCESS OF $15 MILLION, UP TO $700 MILLION.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM.

THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE

TREASURY THAT

PROVIDES FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE CURRENT PROGRAM HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED THROUGH 2014. FOR A

FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IN 2014, SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE."

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS THAT INCLUDES REVIEW OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS, UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. THE

COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, THE COMPANY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES

FOR REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION. THE RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING RESERVES AND

A DISCUSSION OF UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND RISK FACTORS, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES."

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES (DISCUSSED BY PRODUCT LINE IN THE "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES" SECTION OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS") ARE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS

CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, INFLATION, JUDICIAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS

DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE UNDERLYING INSURANCE CONTRACT (E.G., CLAIMS-MADE VERSUS OCCURRENCE),

CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF THE OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM, AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE

INSURED EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

THE

COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES FOR UNREPORTED CLAIMS AND DEVELOPMENT ON REPORTED CLAIMS PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT BY ACCIDENT YEAR FOR

EACH TYPE OF EXPOSURE AND BUSINESS UNIT. SIMILARLY, THE COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES OF UNPAID LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS OF THE

RELATIONSHIP OF LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO LOSSES FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AND TYPE OF EXPOSURE. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY'S RESERVING METHODS FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION," AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION."

DISCOUNTING

THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MOST LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND ANNUITY CLAIM PAYMENTS, PRIMARILY ARISING FROM

WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE POLICIES, WERE DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS USING A RATE OF

AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012. THESE DISCOUNTED RESERVES TOTALED $2.21 BILLION AND $2.01 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE DEVELOPMENT TABLE

THE TABLE THAT FOLLOWS SETS FORTH THE YEAR-END RESERVES FROM 2003 THROUGH 2013 AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THOSE RESERVES, PRESENTED

ON A HISTORICAL BASIS. THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND RE-ESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR 2003 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE ACQUISITION BY TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY

CORP. (TPC) OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. (SPC) IN 2004 (REFERRED TO HEREAFTER AS THE MERGER). THE TABLE INCLUDES SPC RESERVES BEGINNING AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN ADDITION, THE

ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND RE-ESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR 2003 THROUGH 2012 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE ACQUISITION OF DOMINION IN NOVEMBER 2013. THE TABLE

INCLUDES DOMINION'S RESERVES BEGINNING AT DECEMBER 31, 2013.

THE

DATA IN THE TABLE IS PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO AVOID MISINTERPRETATION BY THOSE

UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS INFORMATION OR FAMILIAR WITH OTHER DATA COMMONLY REPORTED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE DATA IN THE TABLE IS NOT ACCIDENT YEAR DATA, BUT RATHER A DISPLAY OF 2003 TO

2013 YEAR-END RESERVES AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THOSE RESERVES.

FOR

INSTANCE, THE "CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY (REDUNDANCY)" SHOWN IN THE TABLE FOR EACH YEAR REPRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT BY WHICH ORIGINAL ESTIMATES OF RESERVES AS OF THAT YEAR-END HAVE

CHANGED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. ACCORDINGLY, THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY FOR A YEAR RELATES ONLY TO RESERVES AT THAT YEAR-END AND THOSE AMOUNTS ARE NOT ADDITIVE. EXPRESSED ANOTHER WAY, IF THE ORIGINAL

RESERVES AT THE END OF 2003 INCLUDED $4 MILLION FOR A LOSS THAT IS FINALLY PAID IN 2007 FOR $5 MILLION, THE $1 MILLION DEFICIENCY (THE EXCESS OF THE ACTUAL PAYMENT OF

$5 MILLION OVER THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF $4 MILLION) WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES IN EACH OF THE YEARS 2003 TO 2006 SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

VARIOUS

FACTORS MAY DISTORT THE RE-ESTIMATED RESERVES AND CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY OR REDUNDANCY SHOWN IN THE TABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES SHOWN

IN THE TABLE ARISE FROM CLAIMS ON POLICIES WRITTEN PRIOR TO THE MID-1980S INVOLVING LIABILITY EXPOSURES SUCH AS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN THE POST-1984 PERIOD, THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED

MORE STRINGENT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND POLICY EXCLUSIONS AND HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRACTED OR TERMINATED THE WRITING OF THESE RISKS. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION," AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION." GENERAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS THAT HAVE

AFFECTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE LIABILITIES IN THE PAST WILL NOT NECESSARILY RECUR IN THE FUTURE.

OTHER

FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE DATA IN THE TABLE INCLUDE THE DISCOUNTING OF CERTAIN RESERVES (AS DISCUSSED ABOVE) AND THE USE OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED INSURANCE POLICIES. FOR EXAMPLE,

RESERVES FOR LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND ANNUITY CLAIM PAYMENTS (TABULAR RESERVES), PRIMARILY ARISING FROM WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE POLICIES, ARE

DISCOUNTED TO REFLECT THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. APPARENT DEFICIENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AS THE DISCOUNT ON THESE WORKERS' COMPENSATION

RESERVES IS ACCRETED AT THE APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATES. ALSO, A PORTION OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN WITH RETROSPECTIVELY RATED INSURANCE POLICIES IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE LOSS

EXPERIENCE IS PRIMARILY BORNE BY THE INSURED. FOR THIS BUSINESS, INCREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING INCREASE IN AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM INSUREDS.

LIKEWISE, DECREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN A DECREASE IN RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING DECREASE IN AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM THESE INSUREDS. THE AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON THESE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED

POLICIES MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES OR REDUNDANCIES ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS BUT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE TABLE.

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BECAUSE

OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL EXTRAPOLATION OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REDUNDANCIES OR DEFICIENCIES IN LOSS RESERVES FROM THE DATA IN THE TABLE.

FOR

THE YEAR 2003, THE TABLE EXCLUDES RESERVES OF SPC, WHICH WERE ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER ON APRIL 1, 2004. ACCORDINGLY, THE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT (NET RESERVES FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RE-ESTIMATED AS OF SUBSEQUENT YEARS LESS NET RESERVES RECORDED AT THE END OF THE YEAR, AS ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED) FOR 2003 RELATES ONLY TO LOSSES RECORDED BY TPC AND DOES NOT INCLUDE

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED BY SPC. FOR 2004 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS, THE TABLE INCLUDES SPC RESERVES ACQUIRED AND SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT RECORDED ON THOSE RESERVES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, SPC

GROSS RESERVES WERE $23,274 MILLION, AND NET RESERVES WERE $15,959 MILLION. FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2013, THE TABLE EXCLUDES RESERVES OF DOMINION, WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY ON

NOVEMBER 1, 2013. ACCORDINGLY, THE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2013 DOES NOT INCLUDE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED BY DOMINION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, DOMINION'S GROSS RESERVES

WERE $2,110 MILLION, AND NET RESERVES WERE $1,779 MILLION.

IN

DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA HOLDINGS LIMITED (UNIONAMERICA), WHICH COMPRISED ITS UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.)-BASED RUNOFF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE

BUSINESSES. (UNIONAMERICA WAS ACQUIRED IN 2004 AS PART OF THE MERGER.) IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE SALE, THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES OF UNIONAMERICA TOTALED $790 MILLION. AS A

RESULT OF THE SALE, THOSE OBLIGATIONS CEASED BEING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE SALE IS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE AS A REDUCTION IN DECEMBER 31, 2008 NET RESERVES OF

$790 MILLION AND AS A $790 MILLION INCREASE IN PAID LOSSES FOR EACH OF THE YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2007 TO REFLECT THE TRANSFER (PAYMENT) OF THE RESERVES TO THE BUYER, RESULTING IN NO IMPACT

TO INCURRED LOSSES.

RESERVES ON STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011, CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (NET OF REINSURANCE) SHOWN IN THE PRECEDING

TABLE, WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP RESERVES), WERE $17 MILLION HIGHER, $22 MILLION LOWER AND $20 MILLION HIGHER,

RESPECTIVELY, THAN THOSE REPORTED IN THE COMPANY'S RESPECTIVE ANNUAL

REPORTS FILED WITH INSURANCE REGULATORS, WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES (STATUTORY RESERVES).

THE

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GAAP AND STATUTORY RESERVES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN GAAP AND STATUTORY ACCOUNTING FOR TWO ITEMS, (1) FEES ASSOCIATED WITH BILLING OF

REQUIRED REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER LARGE DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS, AND (2) THE ACCOUNTING FOR RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE. FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY PAYS THE DEDUCTIBLE PORTION OF A CASUALTY

INSURANCE CLAIM AND THEN SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE INSURED, PLUS A FEE. THIS FEE IS REPORTED AS FEE INCOME FOR GAAP REPORTING, BUT AS AN OFFSET TO CLAIM EXPENSES PAID FOR STATUTORY REPORTING.

RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES RESULT FROM REINSURANCE PLACED TO COVER LOSSES ON INSURED EVENTS OCCURRING PRIOR TO THE INCEPTION OF A REINSURANCE CONTRACT. FOR GAAP REPORTING, RETROACTIVE

REINSURANCE BALANCES ARE INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND RESULT IN LOWER NET RESERVE AMOUNTS. STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES REQUIRE RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES TO BE RECORDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES AS CONTRA-LIABILITIES RATHER THAN IN LOSS RESERVES.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS ARE SEGREGATED FROM OTHER CLAIMS AND ARE HANDLED SEPARATELY BY THE COMPANY'S SPECIAL LIABILITY GROUP,

A SEPARATE UNIT STAFFED BY DEDICATED LEGAL, CLAIM, FINANCE AND ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION."

INTERCOMPANY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

MOST OF THE COMPANY'S DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE MEMBERS OF AN INTERCOMPANY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE POOLING

ARRANGEMENT. POOLING ARRANGEMENTS PERMIT THE PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO RELY ON THE CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE POOL'S POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS RATHER THAN JUST ON ITS OWN POLICYHOLDER SURPLUS. UNDER SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS, THE MEMBERS SHARE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INSURANCE BUSINESS THAT IS WRITTEN AND ALLOCATE THE COMBINED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES.

RATINGS

RATINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ASSESSING THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES RATINGS

FROM THE FOLLOWING MAJOR RATING AGENCIES: A.M. BEST COMPANY (A.M. BEST), FITCH RATINGS (FITCH), MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODY'S) AND STANDARD & POOR'S CORP.

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(S&P).

RATING AGENCIES TYPICALLY ISSUE TWO TYPES OF RATINGS FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES: CLAIMS-PAYING (OR FINANCIAL STRENGTH) RATINGS WHICH REFLECT THE RATING AGENCY'S ASSESSMENT OF AN INSURER'S ABILITY

TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND DEBT RATINGS WHICH REFLECT THE RATING AGENCY'S ASSESSMENT OF A COMPANY'S PROSPECTS FOR REPAYING ITS DEBTS AND ARE CONSIDERED BY LENDERS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE SETTING OF INTEREST RATES AND TERMS FOR A COMPANY'S SHORT- AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. AGENCY RATINGS ARE NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY, SELL OR HOLD ANY SECURITY, AND THEY MAY BE

REVISED OR WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME BY THE RATING AGENCY. EACH AGENCY'S RATING SHOULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER AGENCY'S RATING. THE SYSTEM AND THE NUMBER OF RATING CATEGORIES CAN VARY

WIDELY FROM RATING AGENCY TO RATING AGENCY. CUSTOMERS USUALLY FOCUS ON CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS, WHILE CREDITORS FOCUS ON DEBT RATINGS. INVESTORS USE BOTH TO EVALUATE A COMPANY'S OVERALL FINANCIAL

STRENGTH. THE RATINGS ISSUED ON THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES BY ANY OF THESE AGENCIES ARE ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY AND ARE AVAILABLE ON THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE AND FROM THE AGENCIES.

A

DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS VOLUMES AND COMPETITIVE POSITION BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS

PRODUCTS MAY BE REDUCED, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE SOME CUSTOMERS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATINGS TO ENTER INTO OR RENEW BUSINESS WITH IT.

ADDITIONALLY,

A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS, INCLUDING IN

THE SYNDICATED BANK LOAN MARKET, AND/OR RESULT IN HIGHER FINANCING COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, DOWNGRADES IN THE COMPANY'S DEBT RATINGS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER THE COMPANY'S REVOLVING

CREDIT AGREEMENT (UNDER WHICH THE COST OF BORROWING COULD RANGE FROM LIBOR PLUS 87.5 BASIS POINTS TO LIBOR PLUS 150 BASIS POINTS, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S DEBT RATINGS), THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL

PAPER PROGRAM, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY WERE TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS BY ISSUING DEBT OR SIMILAR TYPES OF SECURITIES. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS THE LEVEL OF INCREASED CASH FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE AS PART OF THE EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT A

ONE- TO TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN ITS DEBT RATINGS WOULD NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE

UNDER ITS EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE AS PART OF THE EVALUATION OF ITS COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES.

GOVERNMENT, TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL AND TAXABLE CORPORATE AND U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND THE COMPANY'S

INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES ARE EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY ITS INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. GENERALLY, THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS

PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO ADEQUATELY FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE RESERVES. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT OF THE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING ITS USE OF TREASURY FUTURES AT TIMES, HAS PRODUCED A DURATION THAT IS LESS THAN THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES. IN 2013, THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE

EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO OF FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM SECURITY INVESTMENTS INCREASED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE YEAR. BY THE

END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013, BASED UPON THE OUTLOOK FOR INTEREST RATES AS COMPARED TO THE CARRYING COST OF ITS SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES, THE COMPANY CLOSED ALL OF THESE

POSITIONS, WHICH IT HAD USED TO MANAGE THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO TO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO A DECREASE IN ITS BOOK VALUE RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES.

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2013, THE COMPANY DID NOT ENTER INTO ANY U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO RECENTLY EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE DURATION OF ITS NET

INSURANCE LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF DECLINING MARKET INTEREST RATES AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, AN INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE RESERVES AS A

COMPONENT OF TOTAL INSURANCE RESERVES. THE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT BY WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE CASH

FLOW FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUND CLAIM PAYMENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS CREDIT

FACILITIES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO INVESTS MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES. THESE

INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT ALSO INVOLVE VARYING DEGREES OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND LESS LIQUIDITY.

REGULATION

U.S. STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION

TRV'S DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE COLLECTIVELY LICENSED TO TRANSACT INSURANCE BUSINESS IN ALL U.S. STATES, THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA, GUAM, PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE VARIOUS STATES AND JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY TRANSACT BUSINESS. THE EXTENT OF REGULATION VARIES, BUT

GENERALLY DERIVES FROM STATUTES THAT DELEGATE REGULATORY, SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO A DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN EACH STATE. THE REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION RELATE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED, THE LICENSING OF INSURERS AND THEIR AGENTS, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS, PREMIUM RATES, RESTRICTIONS ON

THE SIZE OF RISKS THAT MAY BE INSURED UNDER A SINGLE POLICY, RESERVES AND PROVISIONS FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS, DEPOSITS OF SECURITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF POLICYHOLDERS,

APPROVAL OF POLICY FORMS AND THE REGULATION OF MARKET CONDUCT, INCLUDING THE USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION IN UNDERWRITING AS WELL AS OTHER UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, MANY STATES HAVE

ENACTED VARIATIONS OF COMPETITIVE RATEMAKING LAWS, WHICH ALLOW INSURERS TO SET CERTAIN PREMIUM RATES FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF INSURANCE WITHOUT HAVING TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE STATE INSURANCE

DEPARTMENT. STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS ALSO CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND MARKET CONDUCT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND REQUIRE THE FILING OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER REPORTS ON

A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS.

STATE

INSURANCE REGULATION CONTINUES TO EVOLVE IN RESPONSE TO THE CHANGING ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS EFFORTS BY REGULATORS INTERNATIONALLY TO DEVELOP A CONSISTENT

APPROACH TO REGULATIONS. THESE CHANGES ARE EVIDENCED BY THE RECENT INCORPORATION OF SUPERVISORY COLLEGES INTO THE U.S. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. A SUPERVISORY COLLEGE IS A FORUM OF THE REGULATORS HAVING

JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY OVER A HOLDING COMPANY'S VARIOUS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING FOREIGN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, CONVENED TO MEET WITH THE INSURER'S EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, TO EVALUATE THE

INSURER FROM BOTH A GROUP-WIDE AND LEGAL-ENTITY BASIS. SOME OF THE ITEMS EVALUATED DURING THE COLLEGES INCLUDE THE INSURER'S BUSINESS STRATEGIES, ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

INSURANCE REGULATION CONCERNING DIVIDENDS FROM INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.

TRV'S PRINCIPAL DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN

THE STATE OF

CONNECTICUT. THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS REQUIRE NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND FROM AN INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARY THAT, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY'S POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING

DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY'S NET INCOME FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES AND BY STATE REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.

THE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH TRV'S DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE

RESTRICTIVE, LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

RATE AND RULE APPROVALS.

TRV'S DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO EACH STATE'S LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING RATE AND RULE

APPROVALS.

THE APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE USED BY STATES TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT RATES ARE NOT EXCESSIVE, INADEQUATE, UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY OR USED TO ENGAGE IN UNFAIR PRICE COMPETITION.

AN INSURER'S ABILITY TO INCREASE RATES AND THE RELATIVE TIMING OF THE PROCESS ARE DEPENDENT UPON EACH RESPECTIVE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS.

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXITING GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS AND/OR CANCELING OR NONRENEWING POLICIES.

SEVERAL STATES HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH

MAY IMPACT THE

TIMING AND/OR THE ABILITY OF AN INSURER TO EITHER DISCONTINUE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE ITS WRITINGS IN THAT STATE. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TYPICALLY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE, AND IN SOME INSTANCES

INSURANCE DEPARTMENT APPROVAL, PRIOR TO DISCONTINUING A LINE OF

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS

OR WITHDRAWING FROM THAT STATE, AND THEY ALLOW INSURERS TO CANCEL OR NON-RENEW CERTAIN POLICIES ONLY FOR CERTAIN SPECIFIED REASONS.

ASSESSMENTS FOR GUARANTY FUNDS AND SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY POOLING AND REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS.

VIRTUALLY ALL STATES

REQUIRE

INSURERS LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS IN THEIR STATE, INCLUDING TRV'S

DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, TO BEAR A PORTION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED BY SOME CLAIMANTS BECAUSE OF THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURERS. MANY STATES ALSO HAVE LAWS THAT ESTABLISH SECOND-INJURY FUNDS TO

PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO INJURED EMPLOYEES FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRIOR CONDITION OR INJURY.

TRV'S

DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNED RISK POOLS, PRINCIPALLY INVOLVING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE,

PROPERTY WINDPOOLS IN STATES PRONE TO PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM HURRICANES, AND FAIR PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE VARIOUS INSURANCE COVERAGES TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE

THAT COVERAGE IN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET.

ASSESSMENTS

MAY INCLUDE ANY CHARGE MANDATED BY STATUTE OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY THAT IS RELATED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES. EXAMPLES OF SUCH MECHANISMS INCLUDE, BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND, FLORIDA CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION, NATIONAL WORKERS' COMPENSATION REINSURANCE POOL, NORTH CAROLINA BEACH PLAN, LOUISIANA

CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION, AND THE TEXAS WINDSTORM INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. AMOUNTS PAYABLE OR PAID AS A RESULT OF ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE IN SUBSTANCE REINSURANCE, INCLUDING CERTAIN

INVOLUNTARY POOLS WHERE INSURERS ARE REQUIRED TO ASSUME PREMIUMS AND LOSSES FROM THOSE POOLS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS REINSURANCE (E.G., NATIONAL WORKERS' COMPENSATION REINSURANCE POOL, NORTH

CAROLINA BEACH PLAN). AMOUNTS RELATED TO ASSESSMENTS FROM ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE NOT REINSURANCE ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF "GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES." FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

CONCERNING ASSESSMENTS FOR GUARANTY FUNDS AND SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY POOLING AND REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS INCLUDING STATE-FUNDING MECHANISMS, SEE "ITEM 1ARISK

FACTORS."

INSURANCE REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM.

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) DEVELOPED THE INSURANCE REGULATORY

INFORMATION

SYSTEM (IRIS) TO HELP STATE REGULATORS IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION. FINANCIAL EXAMINERS REVIEW ANNUAL STATEMENTS AND KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS BASED ON YEAR-END DATA. THESE RATIOS

ASSIST STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS IN EXECUTING THEIR STATUTORY MANDATE TO OVERSEE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. EACH RATIO HAS AN ESTABLISHED "USUAL RANGE" OF RESULTS. A RATIO

RESULT FALLING OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE OF IRIS RATIOS, HOWEVER, IS NOT CONSIDERED A FAILING RESULT; RATHER, UNUSUAL VALUES ARE VIEWED AS PART OF THE REGULATORY EARLY MONITORING SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, IN

SOME YEARS, IT MAY NOT BE UNUSUAL FOR FINANCIALLY SOUND COMPANIES TO HAVE SEVERAL RATIOS WITH RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES. GENERALLY, AN INSURANCE COMPANY WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO REGULATORY

SCRUTINY IF IT FALLS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES OF FOUR OR MORE OF THE RATIOS.

BASED

ON PRELIMINARY 2013 IRIS RATIOS CALCULATED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS LEAD DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY AND ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE

INSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE IRIS RATIO DUE TO THE SIZE OF THEIR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY HAD

RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE IRIS RATIO DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

IN

2012, THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY AND ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE IRIS RATIO DUE TO THE SIZE OF THEIR

INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES.

MANAGEMENT

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE REGULATORY ACTION AS A RESULT OF THE 2013 IRIS RATIO RESULTS FOR THE LEAD INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. IN ALL INSTANCES IN PRIOR

YEARS, REGULATORS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED UPON FOLLOW-UP THAT NO REGULATORY ACTION WAS REQUIRED.

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC) REQUIREMENTS.

THE NAIC HAS AN RBC REQUIREMENT FOR MOST PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE RBC

REQUIREMENT

DETERMINES MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND IS INTENDED TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS. UNDER LAWS ADOPTED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES, INSURERS HAVING TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL

LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED BY THE RBC CALCULATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL INADEQUACY.

THE

FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE AMONG ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH LEVELS OF CAPITAL ABOVE THE RBC REQUIREMENT. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE

AND INEFFECTIVE TO USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, ALL OF TRV'S DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THE RBC

REQUIREMENT.

INVESTMENT REGULATION.

INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTMENTS MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH PRESCRIBE THE KIND, QUALITY

AND

CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS. IN GENERAL, THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERMIT INVESTMENTS IN FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS, CORPORATE BONDS, PREFERRED AND COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES, MORTGAGE

LOANS, REAL ESTATE AND CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENTS, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED LIMITS AND CERTAIN OTHER QUALIFICATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES BASED IN CANADA AND THE CANADIAN BRANCH OF ONE OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED

BY THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT. THESE CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES AND THE CANADIAN BRANCH ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO PROVINCIAL

INSURANCE LEGISLATION WHICH REGULATES PRICING, UNDERWRITING, COVERAGE AND CLAIM CONDUCT, IN VARYING DEGREES BY PROVINCE AND BY PRODUCT LINE.

TRV'S

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES BASED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE REGULATED BY TWO REGULATORY BODIES, THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY (PRA) AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (FCA). THE

PRA'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO PROMOTE THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF INSURERS FOR THE PROTECTION OF POLICYHOLDERS, WHILE THE FCA HAS THREE OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES: (I) TO SECURE AN APPROPRIATE

DEGREE OF PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS, (II) TO PROTECT AND ENHANCE THE INTEGRITY OF THE UK FINANCIAL SYSTEM, AND (III) TO PROMOTE EFFECTIVE COMPETITION IN THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS. TRV'S

INSURANCE OPERATIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE IRISH BRANCH OF TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED WHICH IS REGULATED BY THE INSURANCE SUPERVISION DEPARTMENTS OF THE CENTRAL

BANK OF IRELAND (AS TO CONDUCT) AND ALSO BY THE PRA.

TRV'S

MANAGING AGENCY (TRAVELERS SYNDICATE MANAGEMENT LTD.) OF ITS LLOYD'S SYNDICATE (TRAVELERS SYNDICATE 5000) IS ALSO REGULATED BY THE PRA AND THE FCA, WHICH HAVE DELEGATED

CERTAIN REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE COUNCIL OF LLOYD'S. TRAVELERS SYNDICATE 5000 IS ABLE TO WRITE BUSINESS IN OVER 75 JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BY VIRTUE OF LLOYD'S INTERNATIONAL

LICENSES. IN EACH SUCH JURISDICTION, THE POLICIES WRITTEN BY TRAVELERS SYNDICATE MANAGEMENT LTD., AS PART OF LLOYD'S, ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND INSURANCE REGULATION OF THAT JURISDICTION.

TRAVELERS UNDERWRITING AGENCY LIMITED, WHICH AS AN INSURANCE INTERMEDIARY IS REGULATED BY THE FCA, PRODUCES INSURANCE BUSINESS FOR TRAVELERS SYNDICATE 5000.

A

TRV SUBSIDIARY, TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY, HAS A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN CHINA. THE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IS REGULATED BY THE CHINA INSURANCE REGULATORY COMMISSION. A TRV

SUBSIDIARY, TCI GLOBAL SERVICES, INC., HAS A LIAISON OFFICE IN INDIA. INSURANCE BUSINESS IN INDIA IS REGULATED BY THE INSURANCE REGULATORY AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. TRV HAS A 49.5% INVESTMENT

IN JMALUCELLI, A JOINT VENTURE HOLDING COMPANY IN BRAZIL. JMALUCELLI'S SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE IN THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESS IN BRAZIL AND ARE REGULATED BY THE SUPERINTENDENCIA DE SEGUROS

PRIVADOS.

REGULATORS

IN THESE JURISDICTIONS REQUIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVELS OF CAPITAL DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSURANCE POLICIES IN FORCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, TRV IS NOT REGULATED AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. HOWEVER, SINCE TRV OWNS CAPITAL STOCK IN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, IT

IS SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER LAWS, OF EACH OF ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES' STATES OF DOMICILE. ALL HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS OTHER LAWS,

REQUIRE DISCLOSURE AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, PRIOR APPROVAL OF MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND AN AFFILIATE. THE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES AND OTHER LAWS ALSO REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PRIOR APPROVAL OF AN ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF A DOMESTIC INSURER, SOME TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AFFILIATES AND THE PAYMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS.

INSURANCE REGULATIONS CONCERNING CHANGE OF CONTROL.

MANY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY LAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE ADVANCE

APPROVAL BY STATE

AGENCIES OF ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT IS DOMICILED, OR, IN SOME CASES, HAVING SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS THAT IT IS DEEMED TO BE COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED, IN THAT STATE.

THE

LAWS OF MANY STATES ALSO CONTAIN PROVISIONS REQUIRING PRE-NOTIFICATION TO STATE AGENCIES PRIOR TO ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF A NON-DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY ADMITTED TO TRANSACT

BUSINESS IN THAT STATE. WHILE THESE PRE-NOTIFICATION STATUTES DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE STATE AGENCY TO DISAPPROVE THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, THEY DO AUTHORIZE ISSUANCE OF CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS WITH RESPECT

TO THE NON-DOMESTIC INSURER IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT SOME CONDITIONS, SUCH AS UNDUE MARKET CONCENTRATION, WOULD RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION.

ANY

TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF ANY OF TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD GENERALLY REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATES IN

WHICH THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED OR COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED. THEY MAY ALSO REQUIRE PRE-ACQUISITION NOTIFICATION IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED PRE-ACQUISITION NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS

AND IN WHICH SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ADMITTED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS.

TWO

OF TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND ITS OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S ARE DOMICILED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. INSURERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES ACT OF 2012, INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE PRA AND FCA. SOME OF TRV'S OTHER INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN, OR AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT INSURANCE BUSINESS IN, CANADA. AUTHORIZED INSURERS IN CANADA ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 407 OF THE

INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT, INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. JMALUCELLI AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL AND OTHER SHARE TRANSFER

RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS IN INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN BRAZIL, MAINLY IN DECREE 73/1966 AND CNSP RESOLUTION NO. 166/2007, WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE NEED FOR PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE

INSURANCE REGULATOR, SUPERINTENDENCIA DE SEGUROS PRIVADOS.

THESE

REQUIREMENTS MAY DETER, DELAY OR PREVENT TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING THE CONTROL OF OR THE OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO TRV'S

SHAREHOLDERS.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

FOR A DISCUSSION OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, SEE PART IITEM 1ARISK

FACTORS INCLUDING "CHANGES IN FEDERAL REGULATION COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON US AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS" AND "NEW REGULATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., INCLUDING IN THE EUROPEAN

UNION, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH."

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

AS A LARGE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE ENTERPRISE, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO MANY RISKS. THESE RISKS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE

ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. SINCE CERTAIN RISKS CAN BE CORRELATED WITH OTHER RISKS, AN EVENT OR A SERIES OF EVENTS CAN IMPACT MULTIPLE AREAS OF THE COMPANY SIMULTANEOUSLY AND HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POSITION

AND/OR LIQUIDITY. THESE EXPOSURES REQUIRE AN ENTITY-WIDE VIEW OF RISK AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO

MANAGE ITS RISK-TAKING TO BE WITHIN ITS RISK APPETITE IN A PRUDENT AND BALANCED EFFORT TO CREATE AND PRESERVE VALUE FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S STAKEHOLDERS. THIS APPROACH TO COMPANY-WIDE RISK EVALUATION

AND MANAGEMENT IS COMMONLY CALLED ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM). ERM ACTIVITIES INVOLVE

BOTH THE IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF A BROAD RANGE OF RISKS AND THE EXECUTION OF SYNCHRONIZED STRATEGIES TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE SUCH RISKS. EFFECTIVE ERM ALSO INCLUDES THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANY'S RISK CAPITAL NEEDS, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND CREDIT RATING CONSIDERATIONS, IN ADDITION TO ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.

ERM

AT THE COMPANY IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. ALL RISK OWNERS ACROSS ALL FUNCTIONS, ALL CORPORATE LEADERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE ENGAGED IN ERM. ERM INVOLVES

RISK-BASED ANALYTICS, AS WELL AS REPORTING AND FEEDBACK THROUGHOUT THE ENTERPRISE IN SUPPORT OF THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES.

THE

COMPANY USES VARIOUS METHODS, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY AND THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER MODELING PROCESSES, TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR AND ANALYZE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

THEM. THESE ANALYSES AND METHODS ARE USED IN MAKING UNDERWRITING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS AS PART OF MANAGING THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION TO CATASTROPHE MODELING AND

ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY ALSO MODELS AND ANALYZES ITS EXPOSURE TO OTHER EXTREME EVENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES PROPRIETARY AND THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER MODELING PROCESSES TO EVALUATE CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

THESE ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES ARE AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THE COMPANY'S ERM PROCESS AND FURTHER SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES.

IN

ADDITION TO THE DAY-TO-DAY ERM ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS UNITS, OTHER KEY INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE THE MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING COMMITTEES (COMPRISED

OF THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE OTHER MOST SENIOR MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT), THE ENTERPRISE AND UNDERWRITING RISK COMMITTEES OF MANAGEMENT, THE CREDIT COMMITTEE, THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE

OFFICER, THE CORPORATE ACTUARIAL GROUP, THE CORPORATE AUDIT GROUP, THE ACCOUNTING POLICY GROUP, THE ENTERPRISE UNDERWRITING GROUP AND MANY OTHERS. A SENIOR EXECUTIVE OVERSEES THE ERM PROCESS. THE

MISSION OF THIS EXECUTIVE IS TO FACILITATE RISK ASSESSMENT AND TO COLLABORATE IN IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY. ANOTHER STRATEGIC ERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS

EXECUTIVE INCLUDES WORKING ACROSS THE COMPANY TO ENHANCE EFFECTIVE AND REALISTIC RISK MODELING CAPABILITIES AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S OVERALL EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE ITS PORTFOLIO OF RISKS TO

BE WITHIN ITS RISK APPETITE. BOARD OVERSIGHT OF ERM IS PROVIDED BY THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH REVIEWS THE STRATEGIES, PROCESSES AND CONTROLS PERTAINING TO THE COMPANY'S

INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND OVERSEES THE IMPLEMENTATION, EXECUTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY'S ERM PROGRAM.

THE

COMPANY'S ERM EFFORTS BUILD UPON THE FOUNDATION OF AN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT. ERM EXPANDS THE INTERNAL CONTROL OBJECTIVES OF EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT OPERATIONS,

RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, TO FOSTERING, LEADING AND SUPPORTING AN INTEGRATED, RISK-BASED CULTURE WITHIN THE COMPANY THAT FOCUSES ON VALUE

CREATION AND PRESERVATION. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF ANY RISK MANAGEMENT OR CONTROL SYSTEM

MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. AS A RESULT, THE POSSIBILITY OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS REMAINS IN SPITE OF THE

COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ERM EFFORTS. AN INVESTOR SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING THE DISCUSSIONS INCLUDED IN

"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS," "ITEM 7AQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK," AND "ITEM 8FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA."

GLOSSARY OF SELECTED INSURANCE TERMS

ACCIDENT YEAR

THE ANNUAL CALENDAR ACCOUNTING PERIOD IN WHICH LOSS EVENTS OCCURRED, REGARDLESS OF WHEN THE LOSSES ARE ACTUALLY REPORTED, BOOKED OR PAID.

ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS

UNASSIGNED SURPLUS AS OF THE MOST RECENT STATUTORY ANNUAL REPORT REDUCED BY TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THAT YEAR'S

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION IN VALUE OR REVALUATION OF ASSETS OR UNREALIZED PROFITS ON INVESTMENTS, AS DEFINED IN THAT REPORT.

ADMITTED INSURER

A COMPANY LICENSED TO TRANSACT INSURANCE BUSINESS WITHIN A STATE.

AGENT

A LICENSED INDIVIDUAL WHO SELLS AND SERVICES INSURANCE POLICIES, RECEIVING A COMMISSION FROM THE INSURER FOR

SELLING THE BUSINESS AND A FEE FOR SERVICING IT. AN INDEPENDENT AGENT REPRESENTS MULTIPLE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SEARCHES THE MARKET FOR THE BEST PRODUCT FOR ITS CLIENT.

ANNUITY

A CONTRACT THAT PAYS A PERIODIC BENEFIT OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF A PERSON (THE ANNUITANT), THE LIVES OF TWO OR

MORE PERSONS OR FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME.

ASSIGNED RISK POOLS

REINSURANCE POOLS WHICH COVER RISKS FOR THOSE UNABLE TO PURCHASE INSURANCE IN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. POSSIBLE

REASONS FOR THIS INABILITY INCLUDE THE RISK BEING TOO GREAT OR THE PROFIT BEING TOO SMALL UNDER THE REQUIRED INSURANCE RATE STRUCTURE. THE COSTS OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE POOLS ARE CHARGED BACK TO INSURANCE CARRIERS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR

DIRECT WRITINGS.

ASSUMED REINSURANCE

INSURANCE RISKS ACQUIRED FROM A CEDING COMPANY.

AVERAGE VALUE ANALYSIS

A CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHOD USED TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN

ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID LOSSES.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT AVERAGE CLAIM VALUES ARE STABLE AND PREDICTABLE OVER TIME FOR A PARTICULAR COHORT OF

CLAIMS. THE METHOD IS UTILIZED MOST OFTEN WHERE ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS ARE KNOWN OR RELIABLY ESTIMABLE FAIRLY EARLY AFTER THE START OF AN ACCIDENT YEAR AND AVERAGE VALUES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT.

THE METHOD COMES UP WITH AN ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS COUNTS BY ACCIDENT YEAR COHORT, AND MULTIPLIES IT BY AN

ESTIMATE OF AVERAGE CLAIM VALUE BY ACCIDENT YEAR COHORT, WITH MULTIPLE METHODS USED TO ESTIMATE THESE AVERAGE CLAIM VALUES.

BOOK VALUE PER SHARE

TOTAL COMMON SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING.

BORNHUETTER-FERGUSON METHOD

A CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT

YEAR/PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE OUTSTANDING LOSSES.

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT THE HISTORICAL RATIO OF ADDITIONAL CLAIM ACTIVITY TO EARNED PREMIUM FOR

A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT/AGE-TO-AGE PERIOD IS STABLE AND PREDICTABLE. IT IMPLICITLY ASSUMES THAT THE ACTUAL ACTIVITY TO DATE FOR PAST PERIODS FOR THAT COHORT IS NOT A CREDIBLE PREDICTOR OF FUTURE ACTIVITY FOR THAT COHORT, OR AT LEAST IS NOT

CREDIBLE ENOUGH TO OVERRIDE THE "A PRIORI" ASSUMPTION AS TO FUTURE ACTIVITY. IT MAY BE APPLIED TO EITHER PAID OR CASE INCURRED CLAIM DATA. IT IS USED MOST OFTEN WHERE THE CLAIM DATA IS SPARSE AND/OR VOLATILE AND FOR RELATIVELY YOUNG COHORTS WITH LOW

VOLUMES AND/OR DATA CREDIBILITY.

TO ILLUSTRATE, THE METHOD MAY ASSUME THAT THE RATIO OF ADDITIONAL PAID LOSSES FROM THE 12 TO 24 MONTH

PERIOD FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR IS 10% OF THE ORIGINAL "A PRIORI" EXPECTED LOSSES FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR. THE ORIGINAL "A PRIORI" EXPECTED LOSSES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON THE ORIGINAL LOSS RATIO ASSUMPTION FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR, WITH SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENT

AS FACTS DEVELOP.

THE ULTIMATE LOSSES EQUAL ACTUAL ACTIVITY TO DATE PLUS THE EXPECTED VALUES FOR FUTURE PERIODS.

BROKER

ONE WHO NEGOTIATES CONTRACTS OF INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE ON BEHALF OF AN INSURED PARTY, RECEIVING A COMMISSION

FROM THE INSURER OR REINSURER FOR PLACEMENT AND OTHER SERVICES RENDERED.

CAPACITY

THE PERCENTAGE OF SURPLUS, OR THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE, THAT AN INSURER OR REINSURER IS WILLING OR ABLE TO

PLACE AT RISK. CAPACITY MAY APPLY TO A SINGLE RISK, A PROGRAM, A LINE OF BUSINESS OR AN ENTIRE BOOK OF BUSINESS. CAPACITY MAY BE CONSTRAINED BY LEGAL RESTRICTIONS, CORPORATE RESTRICTIONS OR INDIRECT RESTRICTIONS.

CAPTIVE

A CLOSELY-HELD INSURANCE COMPANY WHOSE PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THE COMPANY'S OWNERS

OR THEIR AFFILIATES.

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASE-INCURRED DEVELOPMENT METHOD

A CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT LINE

COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID LOSSES.

THE APPROACH IS THE SAME AS THAT DESCRIBED IN THIS GLOSSARY UNDER THE "PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD," BUT BASED

ON THE GROWTH IN CUMULATIVE CASE-INCURRED LOSSES (I.E., THE SUM OF CLAIM-ADJUSTOR INCURRED ESTIMATES FOR CLAIMS IN THE COHORT) RATHER THAN PAID LOSSES. THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT CUMULATIVE CASE INCURRED LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF

CLAIMS WILL GROW IN A STABLE, PREDICTABLE PATTERN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR, BASED ON THE AGE OF THE COHORT.

COMPONENT. IT INVOLVES ANALYZING THE EXPOSURE AND CLAIM ACTIVITY AT AN INDIVIDUAL INSURED LEVEL AND THEN THROUGH THE USE OF DETERMINISTIC OR STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS AND/OR SIMULATIONS, ESTIMATING THE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR THOSE INSUREDS. THE TOTAL LOSSES

FOR THE COHORT ARE THEN THE SUM OF THE LOSSES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL INSURED.

IN PRACTICE, THE METHOD IS SOMETIMES SIMPLIFIED BY PERFORMING THE INDIVIDUAL INSURED ANALYSIS ONLY FOR THE

LARGER INSUREDS, WITH THE COSTS FOR THE SMALLER INSUREDS ESTIMATED VIA SAMPLING APPROACHES (EXTRAPOLATED TO THE REST OF THE SMALLER INSURED POPULATION) OR AGGREGATE APPROACHES (USING ASSUMPTIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE GROUND-UP LARGER INSURED

PAID DEVELOPMENT METHOD

A CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT

YEAR/PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID LOSSES.

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT CUMULATIVE PAID LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS WILL GROW IN A

STABLE, PREDICTABLE PATTERN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR, BASED ON THE AGE OF THE COHORT. THESE AGE-TO-AGE GROWTH FACTORS ARE SOMETIMES CALLED "LINK RATIOS."

FOR EXAMPLE, IF CUMULATIVE PAID LOSSES FOR A PRODUCT LINE XYZ FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2004 WERE $100 AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004 (12 MONTHS AFTER THE START OF THAT ACCIDENT YEAR), THEN GREW TO $120 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 (24 MONTHS AFTER THE START), THE LINK RATIO FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR FROM 12 TO 24 MONTHS WOULD BE 1.20. IF THE LINK

RATIO FOR OTHER RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS FROM 12 TO 24 MONTHS FOR THAT PRODUCT LINE WERE ALSO AT OR AROUND 1.20, THEN THE METHOD WOULD ASSUME A SIMILAR RESULT FOR THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR, I.E., THAT IT TOO WOULD HAVE ITS CUMULATIVE PAID

LOSSES GROW 120% FROM THE 12 MONTH TO 24 MONTH VALUATION.

THIS IS REPEATED FOR EACH AGE-TO-AGE PERIOD INTO THE FUTURE UNTIL THE AGE-TO-AGE LINK RATIOS FOR FUTURE PERIODS

ARE ASSUMED TO BE 1.0 (I.E., THE AGE AT WHICH CUMULATIVE LOSSES ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE STOPPED GROWING).

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR'S CUMULATIVE LOSSES ARE THEN PROJECTED TO ULTIMATE BY MULTIPLYING CURRENT CUMULATIVE LOSSES BY SUCCESSIVE

AGE-TO-AGE LINK RATIOS UP TO THAT FUTURE AGE WHERE GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO END. FOR EXAMPLE, IF GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO END AT 60 MONTHS, THEN THE ULTIMATE INDICATION FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR WITH CUMULATIVE LOSSES AT 12 MONTHS EQUALS THOSE LOSSES

TIMES A 12 TO 24 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A 24 TO 36 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A 36 TO 48 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A 48 TO 60 MONTH LINK RATIO.

ADVANCED APPLICATIONS OF THE METHOD INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGING CONDITIONS DURING THE HISTORICAL PERIOD AND

ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE FUTURE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO

RAISE

CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE.

OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES

CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HURRICANES, TORNADOES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS AND VOLCANIC

ERUPTIONS. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO BE MAN-MADE, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS), EXPLOSIONS, INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES OR A

CONSEQUENCE OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR BUSINESS SUBJECTS US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: HURRICANES FROM

MAINE THROUGH TEXAS; TORNADOES THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL, MID-ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEASTERN REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES; EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA, THE NEW MADRID REGION AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGION OF

NORTH AMERICA; WILDFIRES, PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHWEST; AND TERRORISM IN MAJOR CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES IN CANADA,

THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, AS WELL AS TO A VARIETY OF WORLD-WIDE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES THROUGH OUR LLOYD'S OPERATIONS, AND IN BRAZIL THROUGH OUR JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENT.

THE

INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL AND MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD

INCREASE. SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE UNDERSCORED THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE CLIMATE TRENDS, AND POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD ADD TO THE FREQUENCY AND

SEVERITY OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND CREATE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO FUTURE TRENDS AND EXPOSURES. FOR EXAMPLE, OVER THE LAST DECADE, HURRICANE ACTIVITY HAS IMPACTED AREAS FURTHER INLAND THAN

PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED, THUS EXPANDING THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL FOR LOSSES FROM HURRICANES. ADDITIONALLY, BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TORNADO AND HAIL STORMS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN

GREATER IN RECENT YEARS. MOREOVER, WE COULD EXPERIENCE MORE THAN ONE HIGHLY SEVERE CATASTROPHIC EVENT IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.

ALL

OF THE CATASTROPHE MODELING TOOLS THAT WE USE, OR THAT WE RELY ON FROM OUTSIDE PARTIES, TO HELP MANAGE CERTAIN OF OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS

THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ERROR AND MIS-ESTIMATION AND MAY PRODUCE ESTIMATES THAT ARE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN ACTUAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, COMPARED TO MODELS FOR HURRICANES, MODELS FOR EARTHQUAKES ARE

LESS RELIABLE DUE TO THERE BEING A MORE LIMITED NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL EVENTS TO ANALYZE, WHILE MODELS FOR TORNADOES AND HAIL STORMS ARE NEWER AND MAY BE EVEN LESS RELIABLE DUE TO THE HIGHLY

RANDOM GEOGRAPHIC NATURE AND SIZE OF THESE EVENTS. AS A RESULT, MODELS FOR EARTHQUAKES AND ESPECIALLY FOR TORNADO AND HAIL STORMS MAY HAVE EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTY PREDICTING RISKS AND ESTIMATING

LOSSES. FURTHER, CHANGES IN CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD CAUSE OUR UNDERLYING MODELING DATA TO BE LESS PREDICTIVE, THUS LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE AND MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK. SEE "WE

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS PROVIDE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS" BELOW AS WELL AS "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING" AND "CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS."

THE

EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. INCREASES IN THE VALUE

AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF INSURED PROPERTY AND THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION COULD INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF CLAIMS FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC

LOCATION IMPACTED BY TORNADOES IS INHERENTLY RANDOM AND UNPREDICTABLE AND THE SPECIFIC LOCATION IMPACTED BY A TORNADO MAY OR MAY NOT BE HIGHLY POPULATED AND MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF

OUR INSURED EXPOSURES.

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STATES

HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME PASSED LEGISLATION, AND REGULATORS HAVE TAKEN ACTION, THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK, SUCH AS

LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS FROM REDUCING EXPOSURES OR WITHDRAWING FROM CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS OR MANDATING THAT INSURERS PARTICIPATE IN RESIDUAL MARKETS. PARTICIPATION IN RESIDUAL MARKET

MECHANISMS HAS RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS TO INSURERS, INCLUDING US, AND, IN CERTAIN STATES, THOSE LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH

OUR DIRECT CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE IN THOSE STATES. IF OUR COMPETITORS LEAVE THOSE STATES HAVING RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS, REMAINING INSURERS, INCLUDING US, MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN

LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE. IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE INITIATIVES AND COURT DECISIONS THAT SEEK TO EXPAND INSURANCE

COVERAGE FOR CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE POLICIES OR SEEK TO PREVENT THE APPLICATION OF DEDUCTIBLES. ALSO, OUR ABILITY TO ADJUST TERMS, INCLUDING DEDUCTIBLE LEVELS, OR TO

INCREASE PRICING TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO OFFSET RISING COSTS OF CATASTROPHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, REQUIRES APPROVAL OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN STATES. OUR

ABILITY OR OUR WILLINGNESS TO MANAGE OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE BY RAISING PRICES, MODIFYING UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCING EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC

POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND/OR CHANGES IN THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE. WE ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IN CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS THAT WE MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE WRITE FOR

STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING OUR ACCESS TO OTHER UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES.

THERE

ARE ALSO FACTORS THAT IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES

CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND;

EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE; BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTABILITY. IN RECENT YEARS, INCREASED LATE REPORTING OF WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES BY CLAIMANTS, PARTICULARLY LOSSES FROM HAIL DAMAGE, HAS LED TO HIGHER COSTS THAN

WE PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

EXPOSURE

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES RESULTING FROM A CATASTROPHE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS AND COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE

CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE, RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RATINGS. A RATINGS DOWNGRADE COULD HURT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS. IN ADDITION,

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD CAUSE US TO EXHAUST OUR AVAILABLE REINSURANCE LIMITS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE. SUCH EVENTS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE CREDIT OF OUR

REINSURERS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE, SEE "ITEM 1BUSINESSREINSURANCECATASTROPHE REINSURANCE." CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD

ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE CREDIT OF THE ISSUERS OF SECURITIES, SUCH AS STATES OR MUNICIPALITIES, IN WHOM WE HAVE INVESTED.

IN

ADDITION, COVERAGE IN OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR TERRORISM IS LIMITED. ALTHOUGH THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM PROVIDES BENEFITS IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM,

THOSE BENEFITS ARE SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, ONCE OUR LOSSES EXCEED 20% OF OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PREMIUM FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR

YEAR, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE US FOR 85% OF OUR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM WHICH

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXCEED

THIS DEDUCTIBLE UP TO A TOTAL INDUSTRY PROGRAM CAP OF $100 BILLION. OUR ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS $2.35 BILLION FOR 2014. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE INTERPRETATION

OF THIS LAW IS UNTESTED, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW IT WILL BE APPLIED TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PROGRAM IS DUE TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF 2014; HOWEVER, LEGISLATION TO EXTEND THE

PROGRAM HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CONGRESS COULD DECIDE NOT TO RENEW THE PROGRAM OR COULD OTHERWISE MODIFY OR ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS BY INCREASING OUR EXPOSURE TO TERRORISM LOSSES, OR BY LOWERING OUR BUSINESS VOLUME THROUGH EFFORTS TO AVOID THAT EXPOSURE.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS OR MAN-MADE EVENTS SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK, INCLUDING "UNCONVENTIONAL" ACTS OF

TERRORISM INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY. FURTHER, WE MAY NOT HAVE

SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING FROM A HIGH FREQUENCY OF HIGH SEVERITY NATURAL CATASTROPHES AND/OR OF MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL MEANS. IN ADDITION, WHILE WE

SEEK TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL MEANS, WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ONE OR MORE MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC

EVENTS INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL MEANS.

DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OVER THE

PAST SEVEN YEARS AND PARTICULARLY DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION. DURING A PORTION OF THIS PERIOD, THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER

ECONOMIES EXPERIENCED A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, RESULTING IN HEIGHTENED CREDIT RISK, REDUCED VALUATION OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND DECREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. WHILE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE

GENERALLY STABILIZED AND IMPROVED, THERE IS CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. EVEN IF GROWTH CONTINUES, IT MAY BE AT A SLOW RATE FOR AN EXTENDED

PERIOD OF TIME, AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT RATES, MAY CONTINUE TO BE WEAK.

FURTHERMORE,

FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY AGAIN EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT AND PROLONGED DISRUPTION. IN RECENT YEARS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, HAS TAKEN

EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TO STABILIZE FINANCIAL MARKETS, ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND KEEP INTEREST RATES LOW. WHILE INFLATION HAS RECENTLY BEEN LIMITED AND THAT TREND MAY CONTINUE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

THE STEPS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT TO STABILIZE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND IMPROVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO AN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT. FURTHER, SUCH STEPS MAY BE INEFFECTIVE AND, IN THE CASE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE,

ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED EFFORTS TO CONTINUE TO UNWIND SOME OF SUCH STEPS (INCLUDING THE SO-CALLED "TAPERING" OF QUANTITATIVE EASING) COULD DISRUPT FINANCIAL MARKETS AND/OR COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OR GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

ECONOMIC

UNCERTAINTY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED IN RECENT YEARS BY THE INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT ISSUERS, THE POTENTIAL PARTIAL OR COMPLETE

DISSOLUTION OF THE EUROZONE AND ITS COMMON CURRENCY AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SUCH EVENTS ON GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY. ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS

MAY IMPACT THESE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RISKS. IN THE U.S. DURING 2011, ONE RATING AGENCY DOWNGRADED THE U.S.'S LONG-TERM DEBT CREDIT RATING FROM AAA. FUTURE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES

GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING A FAILURE TO INCREASE THE GOVERNMENT DEBT LIMIT OR A SHUTDOWN OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, COULD INCREASE THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RISK THAT THE U.S. MAY NOT ULTIMATELY PAY ITS

OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE AND MAY DISRUPT FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING CAPITAL MARKETS. FURTHER, ISSUES RELATED TO THE U.S. FEDERAL BUDGET AND TAXES, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HAVE ADDED TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

IF

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, OR IF FINANCIAL MARKETS EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION, IT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR

LIQUIDITY. SEVERAL OF THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW IDENTIFY RISKS THAT RESULT FROM, OR ARE EXACERBATED BY, AN ECONOMIC

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SLOWDOWN

OR FINANCIAL DISRUPTION. THESE INCLUDE RISKS DISCUSSED BELOW RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS, OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES, OUR ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS", PARTICULARLY THE "OUTLOOK" SECTION.

MANY

OF THESE RISKS COULD MATERIALIZE, AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED, EVEN AFTER THE END OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR FINANCIAL DISRUPTION. DURING OR FOLLOWING AN

ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, LOWER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD REDUCE (AND HISTORICALLY HAVE REDUCED) EXPOSURE CHANGES AT RENEWAL. THEY ALSO COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT (AND HISTORICALLY HAVE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED) AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, POLICY ENDORSEMENTS AND MID-TERM CANCELLATIONS AFTER POLICIES ARE WRITTEN, PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESS UNITS WITHIN BUSINESS INSURANCE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY

IMPACT OUR WRITTEN PREMIUMS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE EARNED PREMIUMS LAG WRITTEN PREMIUMS, OUR RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AFTER GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED. AN INFLATIONARY

ENVIRONMENT (WHICH MAY FOLLOW GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY) MAY ALSO, AS WE DISCUSS BELOW, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LOSS COSTS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO. FINALLY, AS A RESULT OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION, WE MAY, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, FACE INCREASED REGULATION.

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED OUR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE NECESSARY, OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT

INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING

DATE.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS: CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES; ADVERSE CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS, INCLUDING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ON MEDICAL COSTS AND AUTO AND HOME REPAIR COSTS;

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING GENERAL INFLATION; LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES; AND VARYING JUDGMENTS AND VIEWPOINTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS, AMONG OTHERS. THE

IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER

SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING

LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER).

AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT STEPS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY COULD LEAD TO HIGHER INFLATION THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, WHICH COULD IN TURN LEAD TO

AN INCREASE IN OUR LOSS COSTS. THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON LOSS COSTS COULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED FOR THOSE LINES OF BUSINESS THAT ARE CONSIDERED "LONG TAIL", SUCH AS GENERAL LIABILITY, AS THEY REQUIRE A

RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. IN ADDITION, INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN MEDICAL COSTS MAY BE INCREASED BY THE HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION AND

ITS IMPLEMENTATION. THE ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES MAY ALSO BE MORE DIFFICULT DURING TIMES OF ADVERSE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DUE TO UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN

BEHAVIOR OF CLAIMANTS AND POLICYHOLDERS, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT REPORTING OF EXPOSURES AND/OR LOSSES, REDUCED MAINTENANCE OF INSURED PROPERTIES OR INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SMALL CLAIMS OR

DELAYS IN THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS.

WE

CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR, ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS, ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND

SETTLED AND THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT EVOLVES. BUSINESS JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROCESS,

INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. DIFFERENT EXPERTS MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL

UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF FOCUS. HENCE, SUCH EXPERTS MAY AT TIMES PRODUCE ESTIMATES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. THIS RISK MAY

BE EXACERBATED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACQUISITION. EXPERTS PROVIDING INPUT TO THE VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE ACTUARIES, UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS

OTHER MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

WE

ATTEMPT TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED OR REVIEWED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY

UNDERLYING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ESTIMATES, THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WILL LIKELY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE

RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN IS CURRENTLY RESERVED.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM ONE INSURED EVENT, OR AN ACCUMULATION OF INSURED EVENTS, MAY EXCEED THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN

ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

FOR

A DISCUSSION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES BY PRODUCT LINE, INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF COMMON FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT REQUIRED RESERVES, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES."

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR MATERIAL REALIZED OR UNREALIZED LOSSES.

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART

OF OUR

OVERALL PROFITABILITY. FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 93% OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES

CAUSED BY INFLATION OR OTHER FACTORS (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS) AFFECT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS ON OUR FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. A DECLINE

IN INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND NEW FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING THOSE PURCHASED TO RE-INVEST MATURITIES FROM THE EXISTING PORTFOLIO), THEREBY

NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME, WHILE RISING INTEREST RATES REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, THEREBY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR BOOK VALUE. DURING 2013,

THE NET UNREALIZED GAIN IN OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO DECLINED FROM $4.56 BILLION TO $1.76 BILLION AS INTEREST RATES INCREASED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FURTHER INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES

(INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS) COULD RESULT IN FURTHER DECLINES IN THAT UNREALIZED GAIN POSITION OR EVEN RESULT IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS, THEREBY ADVERSELY IMPACTING OUR BOOK VALUE. NOTWITHSTANDING

INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES IN 2013, INTEREST RATES IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN AT VERY LOW LEVELS RELATIVE TO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT RATES MAY REMAIN AT LOW LEVELS

FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD. THE VALUE OF OUR FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MAY DEFAULT OR BECOME IMPAIRED DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR PORTFOLIO, OR DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN INSURER THAT GUARANTEES AN ISSUER'S PAYMENTS OF SUCH

INVESTMENTS. SUCH DEFAULTS AND

IMPAIRMENTS COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COULD BE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER RISK OF

DEFAULT.

OUR

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED, IN SUBSTANTIAL PART, IN OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL

BOND PORTFOLIO). NOTWITHSTANDING THE RELATIVELY LOW HISTORICAL RATES OF DEFAULT ON MANY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS AND

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTWITHSTANDING

THAT WE TYPICALLY SEEK TO INVEST IN HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY SECURITIES (INCLUDING THOSE WITH STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS SUCH AS BEING SECURED BY DEDICATED OR PLEDGED SOURCES OF REVENUE), OUR

MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO COULD BE SUBJECT TO DEFAULT OR IMPAIRMENT. IN PARTICULAR.



THE PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT BEGAN IN 2008, AND THE LIMITED ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT HAS FOLLOWED, HAS RESULTED IN

MANY STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OPERATING UNDER DEFICITS OR PROJECTED DEFICITS. THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THESE DEFICITS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION OF OUR

MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO. THESE DEFICITS MAY BE EXACERBATED BY THE IMPACT OF UNFUNDED PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS OR BY DECLINING MUNICIPAL TAX BASES AND REVENUES IN

TIMES OF FINANCIAL STRESS.



SOME ISSUERS MAY BE UNWILLING TO INCREASE TAX RATES, OR TO REDUCE SPENDING, TO FUND INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON

THEIR MUNICIPAL BONDS, OR MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET TO FUND SUCH PAYMENTS. THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD DEFAULTS MAY INCREASE IF SOME ISSUERS VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO DEFAULT, INSTEAD

OF IMPLEMENTING DIFFICULT FISCAL MEASURES, AND THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CONSEQUENCES (SUCH AS REDUCED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS) ARE LESS SEVERE THAN EXPECTED.



THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD DEFAULTS MAY ALSO INCREASE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN LEGISLATION THAT PERMIT STATES, MUNICIPALITIES

AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION WHERE THEY WERE NOT PERMITTED BEFORE. IN ADDITION, THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION OF MUNICIPAL BONDS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THERE

ARE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS IN A BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER PROCEEDING THAT LESSEN THE VALUE OF STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, DEBTORS MAY CHALLENGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS THOUGHT

TO BE PROVIDED BY MUNICIPAL SECURITIES BACKED BY A DEDICATED SOURCE OF REVENUE. THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION MAY ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THERE ARE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS IN A BANKRUPTCY OR

OTHER PROCEEDING THAT QUESTION THE PAYMENT PRIORITY OF MUNICIPAL BONDS.

A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO WILL MATURE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO IS EXPECTED TO MATURE OVER THE NEXT THREE

YEARS (THIS INCLUDES THE EARLY REDEMPTION OF BONDS, ASSUMING INTEREST RATES (INCLUDING CREDIT SPREADS) DO NOT RISE SIGNIFICANTLY BY APPLICABLE CALL DATES). FOR A SCHEDULE OF THE CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES

OF OUR FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO BY YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONSINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO." OF THAT MATURING PORTFOLIO, A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT INCLUDES MUNICIPAL BONDS THAT HAVE BEEN PRE-REFUNDED WITH U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. AS A RESULT, EVEN IF

OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, THE OVERALL YIELD ON AND COMPOSITION OF OUR PORTFOLIO COULD BE MEANINGFULLY IMPACTED BY THE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS

AVAILABLE FOR REINVESTMENT WITH THE PROCEEDS OF MATURED BONDS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YIELDS REMAIN LOW WHEN WE REINVEST SUCH PROCEEDS, OUR FUTURE NET INVESTMENT INCOME WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN

ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC BONDS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE AT THE TIME OF RE-INVESTMENT, THE MIX OF SPECIFIC ISSUERS IN OUR FIXED-INCOME AND MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO WILL CHANGE. AS A RESULT,

THE OVERALL CREDIT PROFILE AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR PORTFOLIO COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. ALSO, A DECREASE IN MUNICIPAL BONDS THAT HAVE BEEN PRE-REFUNDED WITH U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES COULD REDUCE

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

OUR

PORTFOLIO HAS BENEFITED FROM TAX EXEMPTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE GOVERNING DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH AS FOREIGN

TAX CREDITS). CHANGES IN THESE LAWS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. SEE "CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS OR IN THE TAX LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT US" BELOW.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES: RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS; PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY

SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES; COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; AND WHOLLY-OWNED REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, ALL

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF

WHICH COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY FURTHER DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUATIONS AND/OR FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION.

WE

ALSO INVEST A PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN OTHER

TYPES OF NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING COMMODITIES. ALL OF THESE ASSET CLASSES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY IN THEIR INVESTMENT RETURNS THAN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. GENERAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND THE REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT

INCOME, AND/OR RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY REALIZE REDUCED RETURNS ON THESE INVESTMENTS, INCUR LOSSES ON SALES OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND BE REQUIRED TO

WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S.

TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS TO MANAGE THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO. ALTHOUGH THE USE OF U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS IN 2013 RESULTED IN REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS,

U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS CAN ALSO RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASED VALUATION UNCERTAINTIES WHEN INVESTMENT MARKETS ARE ILLIQUID. THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE

ILLIQUID, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (I.E., THE CARRYING AMOUNT) OF THE PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AS REFLECTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF PRICES AT WHICH ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS COULD OCCUR.

GIVEN

THAT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, WE MAY, DEPENDING ON CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE FUTURE, MAKE CHANGES TO THE MIX OF INVESTMENTS IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

THESE CHANGES MAY IMPACT THE DURATION, VOLATILITY AND RISK OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE REALIZED AND/OR

UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY.

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BECAUSE OF OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

WITH

REGARD TO ASBESTOS CLAIMS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS (INCLUDING OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY).

FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS AND THE CONTINUED FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. THE FOCUS ON THESE

DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. THE BANKRUPTCY OF MANY TRADITIONAL DEFENDANTS HAS PROMPTED

PLAINTIFFS TO AGGRESSIVELY SEEK OUT POTENTIAL NEW DEFENDANTS AND HAS CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT WHO REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM.

CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF

THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE

DOCKET. THIS TREND OF PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

PAYMENTS WE EXPERIENCED.

WE

ALSO CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A

PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED

AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNDER

THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDER'S FAVOR AND OUR OTHER DEFENSES ARE

NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY

CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN A MODERATION IN THE OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

FURTHER,

IN ADDITION TO ASBESTOS CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH

RESPECT TO THE HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST

INSURERS, INCLUDING US, COULD BE MADE IN THE FUTURE. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST

INSURERS BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY.

WITH

REGARD TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR ALLEGED

DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND

THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION.

LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS

HAVE INTERPRETED

THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

UNCERTAINTIES

SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS AND RELATED

LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT

LIMITATION.



THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION;



ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS;



A FURTHER INCREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE, AND/OR THE NUMBER OF, ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS

ANTICIPATED;



THE EMERGENCE OF A GREATER NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS THAN ANTICIPATED AS A RESULT OF EXTENDED LIFE EXPECTANCIES RESULTING

FROM MEDICAL ADVANCES AND LIFESTYLE IMPROVEMENTS;



THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES WE HAVE ISSUED;



THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS;



THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST US;



FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS;

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS



THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY

LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS; AND



UNCERTAINTIES ARISING FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS.

IT

IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS

ENVIRONMENT COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION AND FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR

JUDICIAL REFORMS ESTABLISHING MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR

COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS

OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE.

WHILE

THE ONGOING EVALUATION OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN

LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND

"ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS." ALSO SEE

"ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS."

WE ARE EXPOSED TO, AND MAY FACE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING, MASS TORT CLAIMS SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR

SUBSTANCES.

IN ADDITION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO OTHER TYPES OF MASS TORT CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING LEAD PAINT, SILICA AND WELDING ROD FUMES. ESTABLISHING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MASS TORT CLAIMS IS SUBJECT TO

UNCERTAINTIES BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, DISPUTES CONCERNING MEDICAL CAUSATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DISEASES, GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION OF THE LAWSUITS

ASSERTING THE CLAIMS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE RISE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS WITHOUT UNDERLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN DISEASE RATES. MOREOVER, EVOLVING

JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS TORT THEORIES AND DEFENSES, INCLUDING APPLICATION OF VARIOUS THEORIES OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF

INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THESE CLAIMS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE, AND SUCH CHANGE COULD BE MATERIAL. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

AS INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL, JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND

OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIM AND COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING BY EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OUR

UNDERWRITING INTENT, BY INCREASING THE NUMBER, SIZE OR TYPES OF CLAIMS OR BY MANDATING CHANGES TO OUR UNDERWRITING PRACTICES. EXAMPLES OF EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO.



JUDICIAL EXPANSION OF POLICY COVERAGE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW OR EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY;



PLAINTIFFS TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATING TO

CLAIMS-HANDLING AND OTHER PRACTICES;

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS



CLAIMS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS, WHICH OFTEN PRESENT COMPLEX COVERAGE AND DAMAGE VALUATION QUESTIONS;



CLAIMS UNDER DIRECTORS' & OFFICERS' INSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO LOSSES FROM INVOLVEMENT IN FINANCIAL MARKET

ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MORTGAGE OR FINANCIAL PRODUCT ORIGINATION, DISTRIBUTION, STRUCTURING OR SERVICING AND FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES; FAILED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; FRAUD; POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING

IRREGULARITIES; AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ISSUES;



CLAIMS RELATED TO DATA SECURITY BREACHES, INFORMATION SYSTEM FAILURES OR CYBER-ATTACKS;



THE ASSERTION OF "PUBLIC NUISANCE" OR SIMILAR THEORIES OF LIABILITY, PURSUANT TO WHICH PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO RECOVER MONIES

SPENT TO ADMINISTER PUBLIC HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, ABATE HAZARDS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND/OR RECOVER DAMAGES PURPORTEDLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A "PUBLIC NUISANCE";



CLAIMS RELATING TO MOLESTATION BY AN EMPLOYEE OR A VOLUNTEER OF AN INSURED;



MEDICAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT LINK HEALTH ISSUES TO PARTICULAR CAUSES (FOR EXAMPLE, CUMULATIVE TRAUMA), RESULTING IN LIABILITY

OR WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS;



CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT ONE OR MORE OF OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT ON PERSONS BELONGING TO A PROTECTED

CLASS IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW, INCLUDING THE FAIR HOUSING ACT;



CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF TECHNIQUES TO EXPAND ACCESS TO OIL AND GAS RESOURCES, SUCH AS HYDRAULIC FRACTURING;



CLAIMS RELATING TO UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES OF CURRENT OR NEW TECHNOLOGIES; AND



CLAIMS RELATING TO POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, INCLUDING HIGHER FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF WEATHER-RELATED

EVENTS.

IN

SOME INSTANCES, THESE EMERGING ISSUES MAY NOT BECOME APPARENT FOR SOME TIME AFTER WE HAVE ISSUED THE AFFECTED INSURANCE POLICIES. AS A RESULT, THE FULL EXTENT OF LIABILITY UNDER OUR

INSURANCE POLICIES MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THE POLICIES ARE ISSUED.

IN

ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL PASSAGE OF NEW LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO EXPAND THE RIGHT TO SUE, TO REMOVE LIMITATIONS ON RECOVERY, TO DEEM BY STATUTE THE EXISTENCE OF A COVERED OCCURRENCE, TO

EXTEND THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OR OTHERWISE TO REPEAL OR WEAKEN TORT REFORMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

THE

EFFECTS OF THESE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY.

THE

PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL REMAIN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INSURERS WHICH MAY OFFER

PRODUCTS AT PRICES AND ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ECONOMIC STANDARDS IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE THEIR BUSINESS. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ALSO BE

IMPACTED BY CURRENT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS AVAILABLE TO US AS WELL AS TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN RECENT YEARS, PENSION AND HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHER ENTITIES

WITH SUBSTANTIAL AVAILABLE CAPITAL HAVE INCREASINGLY SOUGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRIES. WELL-CAPITALIZED NEW ENTRANTS TO THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRIES, OR EXISTING COMPETITORS THAT RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL INFUSIONS OF CAPITAL MAY CONDUCT BUSINESS IN WAYS THAT ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND PROFITABILITY.

FURTHER, AN EXPANDED SUPPLY OF REINSURANCE CAPITAL MAY LOWER COSTS FOR INSURERS THAT RELY ON REINSURANCE AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, THOSE INSURERS MAY BE ABLE TO PRICE THEIR PRODUCTS MORE COMPETITIVELY.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, INCLUDING CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE USE OF COMPARATIVE RATING TECHNOLOGIES HAS IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT, OUR BUSINESS AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE

COMPANY'S PERSONAL INSURANCE NEW BUSINESS IS WRITTEN AFTER AN AGENT COMPARES QUOTES USING COMPARATIVE RATING TECHNOLOGIES, A COST-EFFICIENT MEANS OF OBTAINING QUOTES FROM MULTIPLE COMPANIES. BECAUSE

THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, WHETHER BY AGENTS OR DIRECTLY BY CUSTOMERS, FACILITATES THE PROCESS OF GENERATING MULTIPLE QUOTES, THE TECHNOLOGY HAS INCREASED PRICE COMPARISON ON NEW BUSINESS AND,

INCREASINGLY, ON RENEWAL BUSINESS. IT ALSO HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF QUOTE ACTIVITY AND A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF QUOTES THAT RESULT IN NEW BUSINESS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND THESE TRENDS MAY

CONTINUE OR ACCELERATE. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OPERATE WITH A COMPETITIVE COST STRUCTURE OR ACCURATELY ESTIMATE AND PRICE FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, OUR UNDERWRITING MARGINS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED OVER TIME. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED TO ACCESS COMPARATIVE RATES FOR SMALL COMMERCIAL BUSINESS. AGENTS, BROKERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY

ALSO CREATE ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS, SUCH AS INSURANCE EXCHANGES, THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND PRICING.

OTHER

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY PRESENT COMPETITIVE RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, INNOVATIONS, SUCH AS TELEMATICS AND OTHER USAGE-BASED METHODS OF DETERMINING PREMIUMS, CAN IMPACT PRODUCT DESIGN

AND PRICING AND MAY BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTOR. OTHER POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, SUCH AS DRIVERLESS CARS, COULD DISRUPT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM CURRENT

CUSTOMERS, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION COULD BE IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO DEPLOY, IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER, TECHNOLOGY THAT COLLECTS AND

ANALYZES A WIDE VARIETY OF DATA POINTS (SO-CALLED "BIG DATA" ANALYSIS) TO MAKE UNDERWRITING OR OTHER DECISIONS. SEE ALSO "OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON EFFECTIVE

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY" BELOW.

IN

RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERWRITING MARGINS ON MANY OF OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS, AND COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS MAY IMPACT THE SUCCESS OF THESE

EFFORTS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE SEEKING IMPROVED RATES, AS WELL AS IMPROVED TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND ALSO INCLUDE OTHER INITIATIVES, SUCH AS REDUCING OPERATING EXPENSES AND ACQUISITION COSTS. THESE

EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND/OR MAY RESULT IN LOWER RETENTION AND NEW BUSINESS LEVELS AND THEREFORE LOWER BUSINESS VOLUMES. IN ADDITION, IF OUR UNDERWRITING IS NOT EFFECTIVE, EFFORTS TO INCREASE

RATES COULD ALSO LEAD TO "ADVERSE SELECTION", WHEREBY ACCOUNTS RETAINED HAVE HIGHER LOSSES, AND ARE LESS PROFITABLE, THAN ACCOUNTS LOST. FOR MORE DETAIL, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOUTLOOK."

IN

PARTICULAR, IN OUR AGENCY AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS, WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERWRITING MARGINS, WHICH HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS.

SEE "ITEM 1BUSINESSPERSONAL INSURANCECOMPETITION" ABOVE FOR A DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THESE ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE OFFER OF A NEW, MORE

COMPETITIVELY-PRICED PRODUCT. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE (I) CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND FOR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS, (II) UTILIZATION OF COMPARATIVE RATING TECHNOLOGIES BY AGENTS AND (III) OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF OUR STRATEGIES TO INCREASE PROFITABILITY IN THE

AGENCY AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, WE MAY NEED TO EXPLORE OTHER ACTIONS OR INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND PROFITABILITY IN THIS LINE OF BUSINESS.

OVERALL,

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IN OUR VARIOUS BUSINESSES IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO OUR.



ABILITY TO PROFITABLY PRICE OUR BUSINESS, RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND OBTAIN NEW BUSINESS;



PREMIUMS CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED (INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED

PROGRAMS);



AGENT, BROKER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS;



ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS;



SPEED OF CLAIMS PAYMENT;



ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER;



PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CORRESPONDING RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES;



REPUTATION, EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES;



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS; AND



LOCAL PRESENCE.

WE

MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN CONTINUING TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON ANY OF THESE BASES IN THE FUTURE. IF COMPETITION LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING BUSINESS OR WRITE NEW BUSINESS AT

ADEQUATE RATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE "COMPETITION" SECTIONS OF THE DISCUSSION ON BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN "ITEM 1BUSINESS."

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT

ALL.

ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO US TO THE EXTENT OF THE CEDED REINSURANCE, WE REMAIN LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. AS A RESULT,

CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT ELIMINATE OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS.

IN

THE PAST, CERTAIN REINSURERS HAVE CEASED WRITING BUSINESS AND ENTERED INTO RUNOFF. SOME OF OUR REINSURANCE CLAIMS MAY BE DISPUTED BY THE REINSURERS, AND WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE

PARTIAL OR NO PAYMENT. THIS IS A PARTICULAR RISK IN THE CASE OF CLAIMS THAT RELATE TO INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN

ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS

CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE CERTAIN AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS ARE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SETTLE

CERTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE WE DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT

IS INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED CLAIM COST IS INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, AS WE RETAIN THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT.

IF IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PAY, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF THE RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE IF, AND TO THE EXTENT, THE PURCHASED ANNUITIES ARE NOT

COVERED BY STATE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS.

MANY

LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE FINANCIAL MARKETS DISRUPTION AND THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. A NUMBER OF THESE COMPANIES, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF THOSE WITH WHICH

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OR TO WHICH WE OTHERWISE HAVE CREDIT EXPOSURE, WERE DOWNGRADED BY VARIOUS RATING AGENCIES DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR TOP REINSURANCE GROUPS BY REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLE AND THE TOP FIVE GROUPS BY AMOUNT OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS PROVIDED, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONSREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES."

THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRICE AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY. THE AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE CAPACITY CAN BE

IMPACTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONS IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET, SUCH AS THE OCCURRENCE OF SIGNIFICANT

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REINSURED

EVENTS. THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL, AND/OR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY FAIL TO MAKE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, AND THUS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION TO EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES (DISCUSSED ABOVE), WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN SEVERAL OTHER AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK RELATING TO POLICYHOLDERS, INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND

BROKERS.

WE

ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN OUR SURETY INSURANCE OPERATIONS, WHERE WE GUARANTEE TO A THIRD PARTY THAT OUR CUSTOMER WILL SATISFY CERTAIN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (E.G., A

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT) OR CERTAIN FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. IF A CUSTOMER OF OURS DEFAULTS, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES AND NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THAT CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, IT IS CUSTOMARY PRACTICE IN THE

SURETY BUSINESS FOR MULTIPLE INSURERS TO PARTICIPATE AS CO-SURETIES ON LARGE SURETY BONDS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE CO-SURETY OBLIGATIONS ARE TYPICALLY JOINT AND SEVERAL, IN WHICH CASE WE ARE

ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR CO-SURETIES.

IN

ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO

PAY THE

CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. WE ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, AND, AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK TO THE POLICYHOLDER. MOREOVER,

CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICIES (I.E., POLICIES IN WHICH PREMIUMS ARE ADJUSTED AFTER THE POLICY PERIOD BASED ON THE ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE OF

THE POLICYHOLDER DURING THE POLICY PERIOD). RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADJUSTED PREMIUM IS GREATER THAN THE ORIGINAL PREMIUM.

OUR

EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK THAT WE HAVE TO OUR INSUREDS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. TO REDUCE SUCH CREDIT RISK, WE REQUIRE CERTAIN INSUREDS TO POST COLLATERAL FOR SOME OR ALL OF

THESE OBLIGATIONS, OFTEN IN THE FORM OF PLEDGED SECURITIES SUCH AS MONEY MARKET FUNDS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY BANKS. IN CASES WHERE WE RECEIVE PLEDGED SECURITIES AND THE INSUREDS ARE UNABLE

TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON THE SECURITIES PLEDGED AND/OR THE RISK THAT OUR ACCESS TO THAT COLLATERAL MAY BE STAYED DURING AN INSURED'S BANKRUPTCY. IN CASES WHERE

WE RECEIVE LETTERS OF CREDIT FROM BANKS AND THE INSUREDS ARE UNABLE TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE BANKS THAT ISSUED THE LETTERS OF CREDIT.

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHEN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE INSURANCE POLICIES FROM US THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE PREMIUMS RELATING TO THOSE POLICIES ARE OFTEN

PAID TO THE AGENTS AND BROKERS FOR PAYMENT TO US. IN MOST JURISDICTIONS, THE PREMIUMS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PAID TO US WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY US. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ASSUME A

DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS DUE FROM INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

TO

A LARGE DEGREE, THE CREDIT RISK WE FACE IS A FUNCTION OF THE ECONOMY; ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE A GREATER RISK IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE RISKS DISCUSSED ABOVE

THROUGH UNDERWRITING AND INVESTMENT GUIDELINES, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS, OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE, COLLATERAL OBTAINED MAY SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE LITTLE

OR NO VALUE. AS A RESULT, OUR EXPOSURE TO THE ABOVE CREDIT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED BY THE STATES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING LICENSING AND SUPERVISION, AND CHANGES IN REGULATION MAY REDUCE

OUR

PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

THESE REGULATORY SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POLICYHOLDERS,

AND NOT NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF INSURERS, THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INVESTORS. FOR EXAMPLE, TO PROTECT POLICYHOLDERS WHOSE INSURANCE COMPANY BECOMES FINANCIALLY INSOLVENT,

GUARANTY FUNDS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ALL 50 STATES TO PAY THE COVERED CLAIMS OF POLICYHOLDERS IN THE EVENT OF

AN INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURER, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE STATE LIMITS. THE FUNDING OF GUARANTY FUNDS IS PROVIDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST REMAINING INSURERS IN THE MARKETPLACE. AS A RESULT, THE

INSOLVENCY OF ONE OR MORE INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST US.

THESE

REGULATORY SYSTEMS ALSO ADDRESS AUTHORIZATION FOR LINES OF BUSINESS, POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS, LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, UNDERWRITING

LIMITATIONS, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS, CHANGES IN CONTROL, PREMIUM RATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF AN INSURER'S BUSINESS.

IN

RECENT YEARS, THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, AND SOME STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR INCREASE STATE

AUTHORITY TO REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES. FURTHER, THE NAIC AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY RE-EXAMINE EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING

ON MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE NAIC RECENTLY AMENDED THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY MODEL

REGULATION REQUIRING INSURERS WHO ARE PART OF A HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM TO COMPLETE AN ENTERPRISE RISK REPORT TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF THE HOLDING COMPANY'S ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM) FRAMEWORK.

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR STATES OF DOMICILE WILL REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR ERM PROCESS OR TAKE OTHER REGULATORY ACTIONS THAT COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO WRITE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS OR REQUIRE THAT WE HOLD

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. SEE "ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT" HEREIN FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S ERM.

IN

A TIME OF FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY OR A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR OTHERWISE, REGULATORS MAY CHOOSE TO ADOPT MORE RESTRICTIVE INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, INSURANCE

REGULATORS MAY CHOOSE TO RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES OR REJECT RATE INCREASES DUE TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE STATE INSURANCE

REGULATORS MAY ALSO INCREASE THE STATUTORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, STATE TAX LAWS THAT SPECIFICALLY IMPACT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES OR

OTHER TAXES, MAY BE ENACTED OR CHANGED BY STATES TO RAISE REVENUES.

STATE

LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR HIGHER COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND THUS

COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

CHANGES IN FEDERAL REGULATION COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON US AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

WHILE THE U.S. FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT

HAS NOT HISTORICALLY REGULATED THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, IN 2010 THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE DODD-FRANK ACT) ESTABLISHED A FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE (THE FIO)

WITHIN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. THE FIO HAS LIMITED REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND IS EMPOWERED TO GATHER DATA AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND INSURERS. IN DECEMBER 2013,

THE FIO RELEASED A REPORT RECOMMENDING WAYS TO MODERNIZE AND IMPROVE THE SYSTEM OF INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. WHILE THE REPORT DID NOT RECOMMEND FULL FEDERAL REGULATION OF INSURANCE,

IT DID SUGGEST AN EXPANDED FEDERAL ROLE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, THE REPORT SUGGESTED THAT CONGRESS SHOULD CONSIDER DIRECT FEDERAL

INVOLVEMENT TO FILL REGULATORY GAPS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT, SHOULD THOSE GAPS PERSIST, FOR EXAMPLE, BY CONSIDERING EITHER ESTABLISHING A FEDERAL COORDINATING BODY OR A DIRECT REGULATOR OF SELECT

ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRY, SUCH AS LARGE COMPLEX INSTITUTIONS OR INSTITUTIONS THAT SEEK A FEDERAL CHARTER, IF A LAW IS PASSED TO ALLOW A FEDERAL CHARTER. IT IS NOT CLEAR AS TO THE EXTENT, IF ANY, THE

REPORT WILL LEAD TO REGULATORY CHANGES OR HOW ANY SUCH CHANGES WOULD IMPACT THE COMPANY.

THE

DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO GIVES THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER A NUMBER OF NONBANK FINANCIAL SERVICES HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING INSURANCE COMPANIES, IF THEY ARE

DESIGNATED BY A TWO-THIRDS VOTE OF A FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE FSOC) AS "SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS" (SIFI). THE FSOC, CHAIRED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, IS A GROUP OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL REGULATORS, A STATE INSURANCE REGULATOR AND AN INDEPENDENT INSURANCE EXPERT. THE

FSOC FINALIZED ITS FIRST SET OF SIFI DESIGNATIONS IN JULY AND SEPTEMBER 2013 AND, BASED UPON THE FSOC'S RULES AND INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE DESIGNATED COMPANIES.

NONETHELESS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COUNCIL MAY CHANGE ITS RULES OR INTERPRETATIONS IN THE FUTURE AND CONCLUDE THAT WE ARE A SIFI. IF WE WERE DESIGNATED AS A SIFI, THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S SUPERVISORY

AUTHORITY COULD INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE HEIGHTENED FINANCIAL REGULATION AND COULD IMPACT REQUIREMENTS REGARDING OUR CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE AS WELL AS OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT

CONDUCT. AS A RESULT OF THE FOREGOING, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, OR OTHER ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REGULATION THAT IS ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE, COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON US, INCLUDING IMPACTING THE WAYS IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, INCREASING COMPLIANCE COSTS AND DUPLICATING STATE REGULATION, AND COULD RESULT IN A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE, PARTICULARLY RELATIVE TO OTHER INSURERS THAT MAY NOT BE

SUBJECT TO THE SAME LEVEL OF REGULATION. CHANGES IN THE U.S. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK COULD IMPACT THE OVERALL COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT BY IMPOSING ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON US AND ALLOWING OTHER COMPETITORS

NOT SUBJECT TO THESE SAME BURDENS TO ENTER OR EXPAND THEIR INSURANCE BUSINESSES.

EVEN

IF WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SECTOR REGULATORY REFORM, INCLUDING THE DODD-FRANK ACT, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON US. FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATORY REFORM COULD HAVE AN UNEXPECTED IMPACT ON OUR RIGHTS AS A CREDITOR OR ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN PARTICULAR, THE DODD-FRANK ACT AUTHORIZES ASSESSMENTS TO PAY

FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BECOME INSOLVENT. WE (AS A FINANCIAL COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN ASSETS) COULD BE ASSESSED, AND, ALTHOUGH

ANY SUCH ASSESSMENT IS REQUIRED TO BE RISK WEIGHTED (I.E., RISKIER FIRMS PAY MORE), SUCH COSTS COULD BE MATERIAL TO US AND ARE NOT CURRENTLY ESTIMABLE.

OTHER

POTENTIAL CHANGES IN U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL REPEAL OF THE MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT (WHICH EXEMPTS INSURANCE FROM

MOST FEDERAL REGULATION) AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN FEDERAL TAXATION, COULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING US.

A DOWNGRADE IN OUR CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INCREASE

OUR

BORROWING COSTS.

CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO AN INSURER'S COMPETITIVE POSITION. RATING AGENCIES PERIODICALLY REVIEW INSURERS'

RATINGS AND CHANGE THEIR RATINGS CRITERIA; THEREFORE, OUR CURRENT RATINGS MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES

BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE REDUCED, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE MANY CUSTOMERS MAY REQUIRE THAT WE MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATINGS TO ENTER INTO OR RENEW BUSINESS WITH US. ADDITIONALLY, WE

MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND WE MAY INCUR HIGHER BORROWING COSTS. IF SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RESULTING FROM ONE OR MORE MAJOR

CATASTROPHES, OR SIGNIFICANT RESERVE ADDITIONS OR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT LOSSES WERE TO CAUSE OUR CAPITAL POSITION TO DETERIORATE SIGNIFICANTLY, OR IF ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE (WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO AT A REASONABLE COST OR AT ALL, ESPECIALLY AT A TIME OF FINANCIAL MARKET

DISRUPTION) IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR LIMIT THE EXTENT OF A DOWNGRADE. A CONTINUED TREND OF MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHES OR A PROLONGED FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION

OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN MAY LEAD RATING AGENCIES TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. SEE ALSO "DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR

BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED." FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR RATINGS, SEE, "ITEM 1BUSINESSRATINGS."

THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS, PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER

DIVIDENDS

OR MAKE FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES.

OUR HOLDING COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR U.S. INSURANCE

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBSIDIARIES

TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON OUTSTANDING DEBT, TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN, TO PAY

OTHER CORPORATE EXPENSES AND TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THEIR STATUTORY SURPLUS, EARNINGS

AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE REGULATION AS AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. OUR U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. IN A TIME OF PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR OTHERWISE, INSURANCE REGULATORS MAY

CHOOSE TO FURTHER RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IS ALSO

RESTRICTED BY REGULATIONS THAT SET STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED.

THE

INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS COULD HARM

OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS, TO PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES.

DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS

PRIMARILY

THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN THROUGH LESS THAN A DOZEN SUCH INTERMEDIARIES. FURTHER, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND OF INCREASED CONSOLIDATION BY AGENTS

AND BROKERS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH, AND FEES PAID TO, SOME AGENTS AND BROKERS, AND/OR OTHERWISE NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PRICING OR DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. LOSS OF ALL OR A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDED THROUGH SUCH AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE

MAY ALSO SEEK TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INCLUDING OUR CURRENT EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PLATFORM IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT AND OUR NEW

QUANTUM 2.0 AUTO PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, AGENTS AND BROKERS MAY CREATE ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS, SUCH AS INSURANCE EXCHANGES, THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT PRODUCT

DIFFERENTIATION AND PRICING. ACCESS TO GREATER LEVELS OF DATA AND INCREASED UTILIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY BY AGENTS AND BROKERS MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. OUR

EFFORTS OR THEIR EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO NEW PRODUCTS OR ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE WAY AGENTS AND BROKERS UTILIZE DATA AND TECHNOLOGY, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS WHO CURRENTLY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, RESULTING IN A LOWER VOLUME OF BUSINESS GENERATED FROM THESE SOURCES.

WE

RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKETING AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY INCREASINGLY RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS AND TOLL-FREE NUMBERS FOR DISTRIBUTION. IN

SOME INSTANCES, OUR AGENTS AND BROKERS ARE REQUIRED TO ACCESS SEPARATE BUSINESS PLATFORMS TO EXECUTE THE SALE OF OUR PERSONAL INSURANCE OR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. SHOULD INTERNET DISRUPTIONS

OCCUR, OR FRUSTRATION WITH OUR BUSINESS PLATFORMS OR DISTRIBUTION INITIATIVES DEVELOP AMONG OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, ANY RESULTING LOSS OF BUSINESS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE "IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA SECURITY AND/OR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED" BELOW.

CUSTOMERS

IN THE PAST HAVE BROUGHT CLAIMS AGAINST US FOR THE ACTIONS OF OUR AGENTS. EVEN WITH PROPER CONTROLS IN PLACE, ACTUAL OR ALLEGED ERRORS OR INACCURACIES BY OUR AGENTS COULD

RESULT IN OUR INVOLVEMENT IN DISPUTES, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTIONS RELATED TO ACTIONS TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN BY OUR AGENTS.

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN TARGETED MARKETS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND MAY CREATE ENHANCED RISKS.

WE MAY DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT INSURE RISKS WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY INSURED, CONTAIN NEW COVERAGE OR COVERAGE TERMS OR

CONTAIN DIFFERENT COMMISSION TERMS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN RESPONSE TO THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN PERSONAL AUTO INSURANCE, WE HAVE STARTED TO ROLL-OUT A NEW PRODUCT CALLED QUANTUM AUTO 2.0 THAT IS

INTENDED TO BE MORE COMPETITIVELY-PRICED. SEE "ITEM 1BUSINESSPERSONAL INSURANCECOMPETITION."



WE MAY REFINE OUR UNDERWRITING PROCESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASED THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS THAT FLOWS THROUGH OUR AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING SYSTEMS.



WE MAY SEEK TO EXPAND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, SUCH AS OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PLATFORM IN PERSONAL

INSURANCE.



WE MAY FOCUS ON GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE HAVE HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE OR NO MARKET

SHARE.

WE

MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPANDING IN TARGETED MARKETS AND, EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL, THESE EFFORTS MAY CREATE ENHANCED RISKS. AMONG OTHER

RISKS.



DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR IN NEW MARKETS MAY NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS.



TO THE EXTENT WE ARE ABLE TO MARKET NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN NEW MARKETS, OUR RISK EXPOSURES MAY CHANGE, AND THE DATA AND

MODELS WE USE TO MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES MAY NOT BE AS SOPHISTICATED OR EFFECTIVE AS THOSE WE USE IN EXISTING MARKETS OR WITH EXISTING PRODUCTS. THIS, IN TURN, COULD LEAD TO LOSSES IN EXCESS OF OUR

EXPECTATIONS.



MODELS UNDERLYING AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DECISIONS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.



EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE OR INCREASE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CONFLICT, SUCH AS

DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER "DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US."



IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS TO A NEW PRODUCT, SOME POLICYHOLDERS' PRICING MAY INCREASE,

WHILE THE PRICING FOR OTHER POLICYHOLDERS MAY DECREASE, THE NET IMPACT OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT RETENTION AND MARGINS.



TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, WE MAY NEED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES, WHICH MAY ALSO

NEGATIVELY IMPACT RESULTS IN THE NEAR TERM.

IF

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN TARGETED MARKETS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS PROVIDE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS.

THE

PROFITABILITY OF OUR

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS WE USE IN PRICING OUR POLICIES. WE UTILIZE THIRD-PARTY AND

PROPRIETARY MODELS TO HELP US PRICE BUSINESS IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO BE CONSISTENT, OVER TIME, WITH ACTUAL RESULTS AND RETURN OBJECTIVES. WE INCORPORATE THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE, EXTERNAL INDUSTRY DATA AND ECONOMIC INDICES INTO OUR MODELING PROCESSES, AND WE USE VARIOUS METHODS, INCLUDING PREDICTIVE MODELING, FORECASTING AND SOPHISTICATED

SIMULATION MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE LOSS TRENDS AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE ALSO USE THESE MODELING PROCESSES, ANALYSES AND METHODS IN MAKING UNDERWRITING,

PRICING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS AS PART OF MANAGING OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES AND OTHER EXTREME ADVERSE EVENTS. THESE MODELING PROCESSES INCORPORATE NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND FORECASTS ABOUT THE

FUTURE LEVEL AND VARIABILITY OF: INTEREST RATES, INFLATION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FREQUENCY

AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES, AMONG OTHERS, THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO MAKE AND MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.

WHETHER

WE USE A PROPRIETARY OR THIRD-PARTY MODEL, FUTURE EXPERIENCE MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM PAST AND CURRENT EXPERIENCE INCORPORATED IN A MODEL'S FORECASTS OR SIMULATIONS. THIS

INCLUDES THE LIKELIHOOD OF EVENTS OCCURRING OR CONTINUING OR THE CORRELATION AMONG EVENTS. THIRD PARTY MODELS MAY PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN WHAT OUR PROPRIETARY MODELING

PROCESSES PROVIDE. AS A RESULT, THIRD-PARTY MODEL ESTIMATES OF LOSSES CAN BE, AND OFTEN HAVE BEEN, MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FOR SIMILAR EVENTS IN COMPARISON TO OUR PROPRIETARY ESTIMATES. THE DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THIRD-PARTY MODEL ESTIMATES AND OUR PROPRIETARY ESTIMATES ARE DRIVEN BY THE USE OF DIFFERENT DATA SETS AS WELL AS DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND FORECASTS REGARDING THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF

EVENTS AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE EVENTS.

IF

WE FAIL TO APPROPRIATELY PRICE THE RISKS WE INSURE, OR FAIL TO CHANGE OUR PRICING MODEL TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT OUR CURRENT EXPERIENCE, OR IF OUR CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS MORE FREQUENT

OR SEVERE THAN OUR UNDERLYING RISK ASSUMPTIONS, OUR PROFIT MARGINS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE FREQUENCY AND/OR SEVERITY OF EXTREME ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRING, OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE RISKS WE ARE EXPOSED TO, WE MAY OVERPRICE OUR PRODUCTS, AND NEW BUSINESS GROWTH AND RETENTION OF OUR EXISTING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. AS WE EXPAND INTO DIFFERENT MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES, WE WILL WRITE MORE POLICIES IN MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS WHERE WE HAVE LESS DATA SPECIFIC TO THESE NEW MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES, AND,

ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ERROR IN OUR MODELS AND STRATEGY. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING."

OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY.

WE DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS FOR CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND PROCESSING CLAIMS, AS WELL AS FOR PROVIDING THE DATA AND ANALYTICS WE

UTILIZE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS, AND THUS OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON MAINTAINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ENHANCE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS

THAT SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN A COST AND RESOURCE EFFICIENT MANNER. SOME SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR EXPENSE

RATIOS AS WE INVEST IN THE PROJECTS AND MAY COST MORE THAN WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE. IN ADDITION, SYSTEM

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY NOT DELIVER THE BENEFITS WE EXPECT ONCE THEY ARE COMPLETE, OR MAY BE REPLACED OR BECOME OBSOLETE MORE QUICKLY THAN EXPECTED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ACCELERATED RECOGNITION OF

EXPENSES. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGE AND UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO OF OUR RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, OR IF THE COSTS

OF DOING SO ARE HIGHER THAN WE EXPECT, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE SERVICES TO NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES COULD

BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA SECURITY AND/OR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

WHILE TECHNOLOGY CAN STREAMLINE MANY BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE COST OF OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISKS.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR EMPLOYEES' ABILITY TO PERFORM, IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. A SHUT-DOWN OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS, ONE OR MORE OF

OUR FACILITIES (INCLUDING OUR PRIMARY DATA PROCESSING FACILITY); A POWER OUTAGE; OR A FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SUCH FUNCTIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS, PARTICULARLY IF SUCH AN INTERRUPTION LASTS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER SUCH AS A NATURAL CATASTROPHE,

TERRORIST ATTACK OR INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT, OR DUE TO A COMPUTER VIRUS, OUR SYSTEMS COULD BE INACCESSIBLE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS INCREASINGLY INTERFACE WITH AND DEPEND ON THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE SERVICE DENIALS OR FAILURES OF CONTROLS IF DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICE EXCEEDS CAPACITY OR A

THIRD-PARTY SYSTEM FAILS OR

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPERIENCES

AN INTERRUPTION. BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS AND FAILURES OF CONTROLS COULD ALSO RESULT IF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS DO NOT INTERFACE WITH EACH OTHER AS INTENDED, INCLUDING AS IT RELATES TO RECENTLY

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. IF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS SUCH A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, SYSTEM FAILURE OR SERVICE DENIAL, THIS COULD RESULT IN A DETERIORATION OF OUR ABILITY

TO WRITE AND PROCESS NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS, PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE, PAY CLAIMS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR PERFORM OTHER NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS.

OUR

OPERATIONS RELY ON THE RELIABLE AND SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. COMPUTER VIRUSES, HACKERS,

EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND OTHER EXTERNAL HAZARDS COULD EXPOSE OUR DATA SYSTEMS TO SECURITY BREACHES, CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL,

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY E-MAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES WITH THIRD-PARTY VENDORS AND OTHERS WITH WHOM WE DO

BUSINESS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE SECURE CAPABILITIES WITH ALL OF SUCH VENDORS AND THIRD PARTIES AND, IN ADDITION, THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT

THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION.

LIKE

OTHER GLOBAL COMPANIES, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE REGULARLY SUBJECT TO AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE TARGET OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODES, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS,

CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER COMPUTER-RELATED PENETRATIONS. WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THREATS TO OUR DATA AND SYSTEMS, TO DATE, WE ARE NOT AWARE THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL BREACH OF CYBER SECURITY.

OVER TIME, THE SOPHISTICATION OF THESE THREATS CONTINUES TO INCREASE, HOWEVER, AND OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL CONTROLS AS WELL AS OTHER PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CYBER

INCIDENTS AND PROTECT OUR INFORMATION MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO DETECT OR PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, OTHER PHYSICAL AND ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER SECURITY BREACHES TO OUR COMPUTER

SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD RESULT IN GREATER OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY MAY FURTHER EXPOSE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO THE RISK OF

CYBER-ATTACKS.

WE

HAVE INCREASINGLY OUTSOURCED CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT

AND MONITOR OUR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS DO NOT PERFORM AS ANTICIPATED OR WE EXPERIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH A TRANSITION, WE MAY NOT REALIZE EXPECTED

PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS OR COST EFFICIENCIES AND MAY EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, INCREASED COSTS AND A LOSS OF BUSINESS. OUR OUTSOURCING OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS

TO THIRD PARTIES MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISK RELATED TO DATA SECURITY OR SERVICE DISRUPTIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WILL

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS, WE TERMINATED A CONTRACT WITH ONE OF OUR OUTSOURCING VENDORS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013 BECAUSE THEY BREACHED THAT CONTRACT BY PROVIDING

PROPRIETARY COMPANY INFORMATION TO ONE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION TO RISKS CAUSED BY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES

MIGHT BE IMPACTED BY CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, UNANTICIPATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR PUBLIC POLICY INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

THE

INCREASED RISKS IDENTIFIED ABOVE COULD EXPOSE US TO DATA LOSS, DISRUPTION OF SERVICE, MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN COMPLIANCE COSTS AND COSTS TO

IMPROVE THE SECURITY AND RESILIENCY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. THE COMPROMISE OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD ALSO SUBJECT US TO LEGAL LIABILITY OR REGULATORY ACTION UNDER

DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY LAWS AND REGULATIONS ENACTED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, THE EUROPEAN UNION OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS OR BY VARIOUS REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS OR EXCHANGES. AS A

RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MIGHT BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES PRIMARILY

IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REPUBLIC

69

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF

IRELAND. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A JOINT VENTURE IN BRAZIL AND MAY ALSO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND OTHER EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS INDIA AND CHINA.

IN

CONDUCTING BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS PRICE

CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE LIMITS, OWNERSHIP LIMITS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE OR ANTI-COMPETITIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR

REPUTATION. FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF OUR ACQUISITION OF DOMINION, A LARGER PORTION OF OUR PREMIUMS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE COMPRISED OF PREMIUMS GENERATED IN CANADA, A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF WHICH WILL CONSIST OF AUTOMOBILE PREMIUMS FROM THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO, WHICH IS A HIGHLY-REGULATED MARKET. OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY ALSO SUBJECT US TO CURRENCY

RISK AND, IN SOME MARKETS, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE THAT RISK. IN ADDITION, IN SOME MARKETS, WE MAY INVEST AS PART OF A JOINT VENTURE WITH A LOCAL COUNTERPARTY. BECAUSE OUR GOVERNANCE

RIGHTS MAY BE LIMITED, WE MAY NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE ABILITY OF THE JOINT VENTURE TO MAKE CERTAIN DECISIONS AND/OR MITIGATE RISKS IT FACES, AND SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS WITH A JOINT VENTURE

COUNTERPARTY MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT. OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN

CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND SIMILAR LAWS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT PROHIBIT THE MAKING OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN OFFICIALS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POLICIES AND CONTROLS IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO

ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, IF THOSE CONTROLS ARE INEFFECTIVE AND AN EMPLOYEE OR INTERMEDIARY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD SUFFER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES

AND OUR BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SOME COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY EMERGING ECONOMIES, HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LACK CLARITY AND, EVEN WITH LOCAL EXPERTISE AND

EFFECTIVE CONTROLS, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF, AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER, THE LOCAL LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING BRAZIL, PARTIES TO A JOINT

VENTURE MAY, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, HAVE LIABILITY FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS OF THE VENTURE, AND THAT LIABILITY MAY EXTEND BEYOND THE CAPITAL INVESTED. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR

MARKET MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESS IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY.

IN

ADDITION, COMPETITION FOR SKILLED EMPLOYEES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS AND OTHER NON-U.S. LOCATIONS MAY BE INTENSE. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HIRE, INTEGRATE, MOTIVATE AND RETAIN A SUFFICIENT

NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND NECESSARY FOR OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES, THOSE BUSINESSES AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

NEW REGULATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., INCLUDING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR

GROWTH.

INSURANCE LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND

MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR HIGHER COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND THUS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

IN

PARTICULAR, THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EXECUTIVE BODY, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, IS IMPLEMENTING NEW CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND RISK MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS CALLED SOLVENCY II THAT WOULD APPLY TO

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF SOLVENCY II HAS BEEN DELAYED UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2016, ALTHOUGH SOME ASPECTS, INCLUDING GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES,

OWN-RISK ASSESSMENTS AND REGULATORY REPORTING, WILL BE PHASED IN BEFORE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION DATE. UNDER SOLVENCY II, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE U.S. PARENT OF A EUROPEAN UNION SUBSIDIARY COULD BE

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SOLVENCY II REQUIREMENTS IF THE REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT THE SUBSIDIARY'S CAPITAL POSITION IS DEPENDENT ON THE PARENT COMPANY AND THE U.S. COMPANY IS NOT ALREADY SUBJECT TO

REGULATIONS DEEMED "EQUIVALENT" TO SOLVENCY II. IN ADDITION, REGULATORS IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY HAS OPERATIONS ARE WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS (IAIS)

(AND WITH THE NAIC IN THE U.S.) TO CONSIDER CHANGES TO INSURANCE COMPANY SUPERVISION, INCLUDING GROUP SUPERVISION.

70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

JULY 2013, THE IAIS PUBLISHED A METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING "GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSURERS" (G-SIIS) AND HIGH LEVEL POLICY MEASURES THAT WILL APPLY TO THE G-SIIS. THE

METHODOLOGY AND MEASURES WERE ENDORSED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (FSB) CREATED BY THE G-20. USING THE IAIS METHODOLOGY, THE FSB, WORKING WITH NATIONAL AUTHORITIES AND THE IAIS, IDENTIFIED NINE

INSURERS THAT THEY DESIGNATED AS G-SIIS. THE IAIS IS WORKING ON THE POLICY MEASURES WHICH INCLUDE HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ENHANCED SUPERVISION. THE COMPANY WAS NOT NAMED A G-SII BY THE FSB IN

THE INITIAL DESIGNATION. THE FSB WILL UPDATE THE LIST ANNUALLY, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE METHODOLOGIES COULD BE AMENDED OR INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE AND THE COMPANY COULD BE NAMED AS A

G-SII.

THE

IAIS ALSO IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR THE SUPERVISION OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS (COMFRAME). THE IAIS RELEASED A CONSULTATION DRAFT IN

OCTOBER 2013, WHICH MAY LEAD TO SIMILAR POLICY MEASURES AS THOSE BEING DEVELOPED FOR G-SIIS, INCLUDING GROUP SUPERVISION AND AN INSURANCE CAPITAL STANDARD (I.E., GLOBAL GROUP CAPITAL

REQUIREMENT). THE COMPANY WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUP UNDER THE CURRENT CONSULTATION DRAFT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT COMFRAME COULD LEAD TO ENHANCED SUPERVISION AND HIGHER

CAPITAL STANDARDS ON A GLOBAL BASIS IF THE IAIS, THE NAIC AND THE INDIVIDUAL STATES ADOPT THE PROPOSED OR SIMILAR PROVISIONS.

WHILE

IT IS NOT YET KNOWN HOW OR IF THESE ACTIONS WILL IMPACT US, SUCH REGULATION COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS OF COMPLIANCE, INCREASED DISCLOSURE AND LESS FLEXIBILITY IN OUR CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

LOSS OF OR SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, SUCH AS CREDIT SCORING, IN THE PRICING AND UNDERWRITING OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR

FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

OUR

UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO COMPETITIVELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AT A LEVEL THAT WILL ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISKS ASSUMED. AS A RESULT, RISK SELECTION AND

PRICING THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF ACTUARIALLY SOUND AND SEGMENTED UNDERWRITING CRITERIA IS CRITICAL. HOWEVER, LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE FINDINGS, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL

THE USE OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF UNDERWRITING CRITERIA. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY USE CREDIT SCORING AS A FACTOR IN PRICING DECISIONS WHERE ALLOWED BY STATE LAW. SOME CONSUMER GROUPS AND/OR REGULATORS HAVE

ALLEGED THAT THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING VIOLATES THE LAW BY DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PERSONS BELONGING TO A PROTECTED CLASS AND ARE CALLING FOR THE PROHIBITION OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF CREDIT

SCORING IN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING. A VARIETY OF OTHER UNDERWRITING CRITERIA USED IN PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE CRITICIZED BY REGULATORS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,

CONSUMER GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS ON SIMILAR OR OTHER GROUNDS. RESULTING REGULATORY ACTIONS OR LITIGATION COULD RESULT IN NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND/OR GENERATE ADVERSE RULES OR FINDINGS, SUCH AS CURTAILING

THE USE OF IMPORTANT UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, EACH OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY RESULT IN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

FROM TIME

TO TIME WE MAY

INVESTIGATE AND PURSUE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES IF WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES AND THAT THE POTENTIAL REWARDS OF AN ACQUISITION JUSTIFY THE RISKS.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN NOVEMBER 2013, WE ACQUIRED DOMINION AND SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED OUR CANADIAN OPERATIONS. THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING AN ACQUIRED COMPANY OR BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, HOWEVER,

AND MAY CREATE UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENDITURES. FOR EXAMPLE, ACQUISITIONS MAY PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISKS, INCLUDING.



THE POTENTIAL DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESS;



THE INEFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF, OR OTHER DIFFICULTIES WITH, UNDERWRITING, RISK MANAGEMENT, CLAIMS HANDLING, INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY AND ACTUARIAL PRACTICES;



UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO AN ACQUIREE'S RESERVE ESTIMATES AND ITS DESIGN AND OPERATION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING;



THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO ACQUISITION INTEGRATION CHALLENGES;

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS



THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES;



UNFORESEEN LIABILITIES;



THE CULTURAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING EMPLOYEES; AND



THE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR CREDIT RATINGS.

ACQUIRED

BUSINESSES MAY NOT PERFORM AS PROJECTED, ANY COST SAVINGS AND OTHER SYNERGIES ANTICIPATED FROM THE ACQUISITION MAY NOT MATERIALIZE AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTEGRATION MAY

BE GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED. ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR DELAYS AND ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS MIGHT BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR CONTROLS DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS ARE NOT

EFFECTIVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE ON A DAILY BASIS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING, CLAIM PROCESSING AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX. THESE ACTIVITIES OFTEN ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNAL GUIDELINES AND POLICIES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. IF OUR CONTROLS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, IT COULD LEAD TO FINANCIAL LOSS, UNANTICIPATED RISK

EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK) OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

IN

ADDITION, INEFFECTIVE CONTROLS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO OUR RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, COULD LEAD TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION. THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND AMOUNT OF DAMAGES

AND PENALTIES CLAIMED

IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT. SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM

WITHIN THE

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN KEY POSITIONS AND THOSE POSSESSING HIGHLY SPECIALIZED UNDERWRITING

KNOWLEDGE. OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS, EFFORTS AND PROPER CONDUCT OF HIGHLY-SKILLED INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES, MANY OF WHOM HAVE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. SEE "ITEM 10DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE" FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. FOR MANY OF OUR SENIOR

POSITIONS, WE COMPETE FOR TALENT NOT JUST WITH INSURANCE OR FINANCIAL SERVICE COMPANIES, BUT WITH OTHER LARGE COMPANIES AND OTHER BUSINESSES. OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR

BUSINESSES AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT, RETAIN

AND MOTIVATE OUR EMPLOYEES, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND REPUTATION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE OUR OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS FOR INFRINGING ON THE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF OTHERS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TRADEMARKS, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

SEE "ITEM 1OTHER INFORMATIONINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY." WE MAY NOT, HOWEVER, BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE AND DISCLOSURE BY OTHERS. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE LAWS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY NOT PREVENT OUR COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING TRADEMARKS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS. MOREOVER, THE AGREEMENTS WE EXECUTE

TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE BREACHED, AND WE MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE REMEDIES IN RESPONSE. OUR ATTEMPTS TO PATENT OR REGISTER OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE U.S. AND

WORLDWIDE MAY NOT SUCCEED INITIALLY OR MAY LATER BE CHALLENGED BY THIRD PARTIES.

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FURTHER,

THE LAWS OF CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE INITIATION OF EXPENSIVE AND PROTRACTED LITIGATION, AND WE MAY NOT PREVAIL. ANY INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.

WE

MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES FROM TIME TO TIME THAT OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN RECENT YEARS, CERTAIN

ENTITIES HAVE ACQUIRED PATENTS IN ORDER TO ALLEGE CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT AGAINST COMPANIES, INCLUDING IN SOME CASES US. ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US COULD CAUSE US

TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME AND MONEY TO DEFEND OURSELVES, REGARDLESS OF THE MERITS OF THE CLAIMS. IF WE ARE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON ANY THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, IT COULD RESULT IN

REPUTATIONAL HARM, PAYMENT OF SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES, PAYMENT OF LICENSE FEES (IF LICENSES ARE EVEN AVAILABLE TO US, ON REASONABLE TERMS OR OTHERWISE) AND/OR SUBSTANTIAL TIME AND EXPENSE TO

REDESIGN OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGIES TO AVOID THE INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WE USE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE IN SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. IF ANY OF OUR SOFTWARE VENDORS

OR LICENSORS ARE FACED WITH INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WE MAY LOSE OUR ABILITY TO USE SUCH SOFTWARE UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS RESOLVED. IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY REDESIGN AN INFRINGING PRODUCT, SERVICE OR

TECHNOLOGY (OR PROCURE A SUBSTITUTE VERSION), THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.

CHANGES TO EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPORTED RESULTS.

AS A U.S.-BASED SEC REGISTRANT, WE ARE CURRENTLY

REQUIRED TO

PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (US GAAP), AS PROMULGATED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB), SUBJECT TO THE

ACCOUNTING-RELATED RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). DURING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE SEC HAS BEEN EVALUATING WHETHER, WHEN AND HOW INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL

REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE U.S. FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEM, INCLUDING FOR COMPANIES SUCH AS US. THE FASB AND THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (IASB) HAVE

ALSO EMBARKED ON A LONG-TERM PROJECT TO CONVERGE US GAAP AND IFRS. IN JUNE 2012, THE FASB ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT INDICATED THAT BASED ON THE NATURE AND TOTALITY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

FASB'S AND IASB'S VIEWS, IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE TWO BOARDS WILL ACHIEVE CONVERGENCE ON THEIR JOINT PROJECT ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS. THE FASB FURTHER NOTED THAT THE FASB AND IASB

HAVE VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE PROJECT. IN JUNE 2013, EACH BOARD ISSUED FOR COMMENT EXPOSURE DRAFTS ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FROM THE OTHER

BOARD'S DRAFT AS WELL AS FROM CURRENT US GAAP. BOTH EXPOSURE DRAFTS PROPOSE CHANGES THAT, IF ULTIMATELY ADOPTED, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ACCOUNTING BY INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY,

FOR PREMIUMS AND UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES, THE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, REINSURANCE, AND DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS. THE BOARDS ARE REVIEWING THE COMMENTS RECEIVED ON THE

EXPOSURE DRAFTS AND ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN RE-DELIBERATIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014. IT IS CURRENTLY UNCLEAR WHAT CHANGES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS UNDER

US GAAP AS A RESULT OF THIS PROJECT, AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER WE WILL CHOOSE TO, OR BE REQUIRED TO, ADOPT IFRS OR HOW THE ADOPTION OF IFRS (OR THE CONVERGENCE OF US GAAP

AND IFRS, INCLUDING THE PROJECT ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS) MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FUTURE. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT SPECIFICALLY

APPLY TO INSURANCE COMPANY OPERATIONS, MAY IMPACT THE CONTENT AND PRESENTATION OF OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND COULD CAUSE INCREASED VOLATILITY IN REPORTED EARNINGS, RESULTING IN OTHER ADVERSE

IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY'S RATINGS AND COST OF CAPITAL, AND DECREASE THE UNDERSTANDABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AS WELL AS THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR REPORTED RESULTS WITH OTHER INSURERS.

CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS OR IN THE TAX LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US.

TAX LAWS MAY CHANGE

IN WAYS THAT

ADVERSELY IMPACT US. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL TAX LEGISLATION

COULD BE ENACTED TO REDUCE THE EXISTING STATUTORY U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35%, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDINGLY, REDUCE ANY U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF ANY NET

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFERRED

TAX ASSET IS VOLATILE AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES. THE EFFECT OF A REDUCTION IN A TAX RATE ON NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS REQUIRED TO BE

RECOGNIZED, IN FULL, AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN ENACTED AND, ALONG WITH OTHER CHANGES IN THE TAX RULES THAT MAY INCREASE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL TAX EXPENSE,

COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS BENEFITED FROM TAX EXEMPTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE GOVERNING DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH

AS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). FEDERAL AND/OR STATE TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED IN CONNECTION WITH DEFICIT REDUCTION OR VARIOUS TYPES OF FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM THAT WOULD LESSEN OR ELIMINATE SOME OR

ALL OF THE TAX ADVANTAGES CURRENTLY BENEFITING US AND THEREFORE COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, SUCH LEGISLATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PARTICULARLY CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF INTEREST FROM MUNICIPAL BONDS (WHICH COMPRISE 49% OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013) COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF THOSE BONDS.

OTHER

TAX LAW CHANGES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US. THE SIZE OF THE FEDERAL DEFICIT, AS WELL AS THE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS FACED BY MANY STATES AND LOCALITIES, INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

CONGRESS AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL RAISE REVENUE BY ENACTING LEGISLATION INCREASING THE TAXES PAID BY INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

NONE.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

THE COMPANY LEASES ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK, AS WELL AS 201 FIELD AND CLAIM OFFICES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY

4.7 MILLION SQUARE FEET THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES UNDER LEASES OR SUBLEASES WITH THIRD PARTIES. THE COMPANY ALSO LEASES OFFICES IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, INDIA, CHINA AND THE REPUBLIC

OF IRELAND THAT HOUSE OPERATIONS (PRIMARILY FOR THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT) IN THOSE LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY OWNS SIX BUILDINGS IN HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT,

CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS TWO OFFICE BUILDINGS IN ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA, WHICH ARE ADJACENT TO ONE ANOTHER AND CONSIST OF

APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS A BUILDING LOCATED IN NORCROSS, GEORGIA, AND LAND OUTSIDE OF OMAHA, NEBRASKA WHERE AN ADDITIONAL BUILDING IS UNDER

CONSTRUCTION. THE COMPANY OWNS A BUILDING IN LONDON, ENGLAND, WHICH HOUSES A PORTION OF ITS FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT'S OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

COMPANY'S QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, OTHER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING MERGERS AND

ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED FINANCINGS), MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. IN OCTOBER 2013, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION THAT ADDED AN ADDITIONAL

$5.0 BILLION OF REPURCHASE CAPACITY.

THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED 8,372 SHARES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. THESE SHARES

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS OF THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME AND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) ARE PRESENTED ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS. DISCUSSIONS OF THE COMPONENTS OF NET INCOME AND SEGMENT

OPERATING INCOME ARE PRESENTED ON A PRETAX BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. DISCUSSIONS OF EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE ARE PRESENTED ON A DILUTED BASIS.

OVERVIEW

DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE OF $9.74 IN 2013 INCREASED BY 55% OVER DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE OF $6.30 IN 2012. NET INCOME OF

$3.67 BILLION IN 2013 INCREASED BY 49% OVER NET INCOME OF $2.47 BILLION IN 2012. THE HIGHER RATE OF INCREASE IN DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF SHARE REPURCHASES IN

RECENT PERIODS. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE PRETAX IMPACTS OF (I) LOWER CATASTROPHE LOSSES, (II) HIGHER UNDERWRITING MARGINS EXCLUDING

CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ("UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS"), (III) AN INCREASE IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND (IV) A GAIN FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF A

LEGAL PROCEEDING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (V) LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND (VI) LOWER NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS

PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE IMPACT OF EARNED PRICING THAT EXCEEDED LOSS COST TRENDS IN EACH OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS SEGMENTS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS NET PRETAX INCREASE

IN

INCOME WAS THE RELATED TAX EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, NET INCOME IN 2013 BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

IN 2013 WAS HIGHER THAN IN 2012. THIS RESULTED FROM INTEREST ON MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY TAXED AT A RATE THAT IS LOWER THAN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE OF 35%, COMPRISING A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF

PRETAX INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2013 WERE $591 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.86 BILLION IN 2012. NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2013 WAS $840 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $940 MILLION IN 2012.

DILUTED

NET INCOME PER SHARE OF $6.30 IN 2012 INCREASED BY 88% OVER DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE OF $3.36 IN 2011. NET INCOME OF $2.47 BILLION IN 2012 INCREASED BY 73% OVER NET

INCOME OF $1.43 BILLION IN 2011. THE HIGHER RATE OF INCREASE IN DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF SHARE REPURCHASES IN RECENT PERIODS. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME PRIMARILY

REFLECTED THE PRETAX IMPACT OF (I) HIGHER UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS, (II) A DECLINE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND (III) HIGHER NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE

IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE AND PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF EARNED

PRICING THAT EXCEEDED LOSS COST TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENTS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS PRETAX INCREASE WAS THE RELATED TAX

EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, NET INCOME IN 2011 BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2012 WAS HIGHER

THAN IN 2011. THIS RESULTED FROM INTEREST ON MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY TAXED AT A RATE THAT IS LOWER THAN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE OF 35%, COMPRISING A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF PRETAX INCOME, AND

THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS IN 2011 DISCUSSED ABOVE. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2012 WERE $1.86 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.56 BILLION IN 2011. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN 2012 WAS $940 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $715 MILLION IN 2011.

REVENUES

SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE LOSSES

THE COMPANY DEFINES A "CATASTROPHE" AS AN EVENT THAT.



IS DESIGNATED A CATASTROPHE BY INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ORGANIZATIONS THAT TRACK AND REPORT ON INSURED LOSSES FROM

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, SUCH AS PROPERTY CLAIM SERVICES (PCS) FOR EVENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA; AND



THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES OF ITS ULTIMATE LOSSES BEFORE REINSURANCE AND TAXES EXCEED A PRE-ESTABLISHED DOLLAR THRESHOLD.

THE

COMPANY'S THRESHOLD FOR DISCLOSING CATASTROPHES IS DETERMINED AT ITS REPORTABLE SEGMENT LEVEL, OR AT A COMBINATION THEREOF, AND RANGED FROM APPROXIMATELY $17 MILLION TO

$30 MILLION OF LOSSES BEFORE REINSURANCE AND TAXES.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS FOR SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHES THE AMOUNT OF LOSSES RECORDED IN EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012, AND 2011, AND THE AMOUNT OF RELATED NET

UNFAVORABLE (FAVORABLE) PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECOGNIZED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE TABLE, A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE IS AN EVENT FOR WHICH THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS ULTIMATE

LOSSES WILL BE $100 MILLION OR MORE AFTER REINSURANCE AND BEFORE TAXES.

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME IN 2013 WAS $2.33 BILLION, $486 MILLION OR 26% HIGHER THAN OPERATING INCOME OF $1.84 BILLION IN

2012. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE PRETAX IMPACT OF (I) LOWER CATASTROPHE LOSSES, (II) HIGHER UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS AND (III) THE SETTLEMENT

OF A LEGAL MATTER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (IV) LOWER NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND (V) LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME. THE IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS

PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE IMPACT OF EARNED PRICING THAT EXCEEDED LOSS COST TRENDS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS NET PRETAX INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS THE RELATED TAX EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY,

OPERATING INCOME IN 2013 BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2013 WAS HIGHER THAN IN 2012. THIS RESULTED

FROM THE IMPACT OF INTEREST ON MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY TAXED AT A RATE THAT IS LOWER THAN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE OF 35%, COMPRISING A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF PRETAX INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2013 WERE $285 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $794 MILLION IN 2012. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN 2013 WAS $325 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $467 MILLION IN 2012. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2013 WAS REDUCED BY A $42 MILLION CHARGE THAT WAS

PRECIPITATED BY LEGISLATION IN NEW YORK AS DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED "CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES" SECTION ABOVE.

OPERATING

INCOME IN 2012 WAS $1.84 BILLION, $489 MILLION OR 36% HIGHER THAN OPERATING INCOME OF $1.35 BILLION IN 2011. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME PRIMARILY

REFLECTED THE PRETAX IMPACT OF (I) HIGHER

UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS, (II) A DECLINE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES, (III) AN INCREASE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND (IV) AN INCREASE IN NET INVESTMENT

INCOME. THE IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE IMPACT OF EARNED PRICING THAT EXCEEDED LOSS COST TRENDS, LOWER NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES AND HIGHER

BUSINESS VOLUME. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS PRETAX INCREASE WAS THE RELATED TAX EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, NET INCOME IN 2011 BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION

OF VARIOUS PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2012 WAS HIGHER THAN IN 2011. THIS RESULTED FROM INTEREST ON MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY TAXED AT A RATE THAT IS LOWER THAN THE

CORPORATE TAX RATE OF 35%, COMPRISING A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF PRETAX INCOME, AND THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS DISCUSSED

88

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ABOVE.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2012 WERE $794 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.02 BILLION IN 2011. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2012 WAS $467 MILLION, COMPARED WITH

$245 MILLION IN 2011.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2013 WAS $1.98 BILLION, $115 MILLION OR 6% LOWER THAN IN 2012. NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2012 WAS

$2.09 BILLION, $49 MILLION OR 2% HIGHER THAN IN 2011. REFER TO THE "NET INVESTMENT INCOME" SECTION OF THE "CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" DISCUSSION

HEREIN FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2013 AND 2012 COMPARED WITH THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEARS. IN ADDITION, REFER TO

NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HEREIN FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY.

FEE INCOME

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FEE INCOME DUE TO ITS SERVICE BUSINESSES, WHICH INCLUDE CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES

TO LARGE COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE TO SELF-INSURE A PORTION OF THEIR INSURANCE RISKS, AS WELL AS CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS. FEE INCOME IN 2013

INCREASED BY $71 MILLION OR 22% OVER 2012. FEE INCOME IN 2012 INCREASED BY $27 MILLION OR 9% OVER 2011. THE INCREASES IN BOTH YEARS PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER SERVICED PREMIUM VOLUME IN

WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS AND HIGHER CLAIM VOLUME IN THE LARGE DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS.

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME IN 2013 WAS $648 MILLION, $6 MILLION OR 1% HIGHER THAN OPERATING INCOME OF $642 MILLION IN 2012.

THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE PRETAX IMPACT OF (I) HIGHER UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS AND (II) HIGHER NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, LARGELY

OFFSET BY (III) LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND (IV) HIGHER CATASTROPHE LOSSES. THE INCREASE IN UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS WAS DRIVEN BY (I) EARNED PRICING THAT EXCEEDED LOSS

COST TRENDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (II) THE IMPACT OF LOWER VOLUMES OF INSURED EXPOSURES, (III) A HIGHER LEVEL OF WHAT THE COMPANY DEFINES AS LARGE LOSSES, (IV) HIGHER GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND (V) HIGHER NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS NET PRETAX INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS THE RELATED TAX EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY,

OPERATING INCOME IN 2013 BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS IN 2013. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2013 DECREASED FROM 2012, PRIMARILY

DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2013 WERE $56 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $50 MILLION IN 2012. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2013 WAS $306 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $298 MILLION IN 2012.

OPERATING

INCOME IN 2012 WAS $642 MILLION, $5 MILLION OR 1% LOWER THAN OPERATING INCOME IN 2011. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME IN 2012 COMPARED WITH 2011 PRIMARILY

REFLECTED THE PRETAX

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECLINES

IN (I) NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND (II) NET INVESTMENT INCOME, LARGELY OFFSET BY (III) HIGHER UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS. THE INCREASE IN

UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS RESULTED FROM THE PRETAX IMPACT OF (I) LOWER LEVELS OF WHAT THE COMPANY DEFINES AS LARGE LOSSES AND (II) EARNED PRICING THAT EXCEEDED LOSS COST TRENDS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (III) THE IMPACT OF LOWER VOLUMES OF INSURED EXPOSURES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS NET PRETAX DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS THE RELATED REDUCTION IN TAX EXPENSE.

ADDITIONALLY, TAX EXPENSE IN 2011 WAS REDUCED BY THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2012 INCREASED OVER 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR

YEAR TAX MATTERS IN 2011 DESCRIBED ABOVE. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2012 WAS $298 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $360 MILLION IN 2011. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2012 WERE

$50 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $55 MILLION IN 2011.

RELATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME ARE REPORTED EXCLUSIVELY IN THIS SEGMENT AND NOT ALLOCATED AMONG ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. AS A RESULT, REPORTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN THE FINANCIAL,

PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER PROPORTION OF ALLOCATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME, INCLUDING THAT FROM THE COMPANY'S NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS

THAT EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2013 AND AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2012. NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2013 ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE ACQUISITION OF DOMINION. REFER TO THE "NET

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2013 WERE $705 MILLION, $38 MILLION OR 6% HIGHER THAN IN 2012. THE INCREASE IN

2013 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF DOMINION, INCLUDING RELATED LEGAL EXPENSES, AND HIGHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2012 WERE

$667 MILLION, $19 MILLION OR 3% HIGHER THAN IN 2011. THE INCREASE IN 2012 PRIMARILY REFLECTED INCREASES IN EMPLOYEE- AND TECHNOLOGY-RELATED COSTS TO ENHANCE OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT FUTURE

PREMIUM CHANGES IN 2013 WERE POSITIVE AND INCREASED OVER 2012, AS GROWTH IN INSURED EXPOSURES IN 2013, COMPARED WITH A DECLINE IN 2012, WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER POSITIVE RENEWAL RATE CHANGES IN

2013 COMPARED WITH 2012. NEW BUSINESS PREMIUMS IN 2013 INCREASED OVER 2012.

NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN INTERNATIONAL IN 2012 WERE $1.06 BILLION, $92 MILLION OR 8% LOWER THAN IN 2011. THE DECREASE IN 2012 PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOWER BUSINESS VOLUME IN

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S, LOWER SURETY VOLUMES IN CANADA, THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S WITHDRAWAL FROM PERSONAL INSURANCE BUSINESS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES OF EXCHANGE. EXCLUDING THE SURETY LINE OF BUSINESS, FOR WHICH THE FOLLOWING ARE NOT RELEVANT MEASURES, BUSINESS RETENTION RATES IN 2012 WERE STRONG AND HIGHER THAN IN

2011. RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES IN 2012 WERE NEGATIVE AND LOWER THAN IN 2011, AS POSITIVE RENEWAL RATE CHANGES WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN INSURED EXPOSURES. NEW BUSINESS PREMIUMS IN 2012 WERE

LOWER THAN IN 2011.

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME IN 2013 WAS $838 MILLION, $621 MILLION HIGHER THAN OPERATING INCOME OF $217 MILLION IN 2012. THE

INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE PRETAX IMPACT OF

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(I) LOWER

CATASTROPHE LOSSES, (II) HIGHER UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS, (III) AN INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES AND (IV) HIGHER NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (V) LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME. THE HIGHER UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS RESULTED FROM THE IMPACT OF EARNED PRICING THAT EXCEEDED LOSS COST TRENDS AND LOWER

NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS NET PRETAX INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS THE RELATED TAX EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, OPERATING INCOME IN 2013 BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION

IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2013 INCREASED OVER 2012. THIS RESULTED FROM INTEREST ON MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY

TAXED AT A RATE THAT IS LOWER THAN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE OF 35%, COMPRISING A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF PRETAX INCOME. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2013 WERE

$250 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.02 BILLION IN 2012. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2013 WAS $209 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $175 MILLION IN 2012.

OPERATING

INCOME IN 2012 WAS $217 MILLION, $549 MILLION HIGHER THAN THE OPERATING LOSS OF ($332) MILLION IN 2011. THE IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING INCOME IN 2012 COMPARED WITH

2011 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE PRETAX IMPACT OF (I) A DECLINE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES, (II) HIGHER UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS AND (III) AN INCREASE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE HIGHER UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS RESULTED FROM LOWER NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES AND LOWER FIRE-RELATED LOSSES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS NET PRETAX INCREASE

IN OPERATING INCOME WAS THE RELATED TAX EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, OPERATING INCOME IN 2011 BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS. THE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2012 INCREASED OVER 2011. THIS RESULTED FROM INTEREST ON MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY TAXED AT A RATE THAT IS LOWER THAN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE OF 35%, COMPRISING A

LOWER PERCENTAGE OF PRETAX INCOME, AS WELL AS THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2012 WERE $1.02 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.49 BILLION IN

2011. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2012 WAS $175 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $110 MILLION IN 2011.

REVENUES

EARNED PREMIUMS

EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2013 WERE $7.32 BILLION, $297 MILLION OR 4% LOWER THAN IN 2012. EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2012 WERE

$7.62 BILLION, $32 MILLION OR LESS THAN 1% HIGHER THAN IN 2011. THE CHANGES IN BOTH YEARS REFLECTED CHANGES IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OVER THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2013 WAS $369 MILLION, $35 MILLION OR 9% LOWER THAN IN 2012. NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2012 WAS

$404 MILLION, $20 MILLION OR 5% LOWER THAN IN 2011. REFER TO THE "NET INVESTMENT INCOME" SECTION OF "CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" HEREIN FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGE IN THE

COMPANY'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2013 AND 2012 AS COMPARED WITH THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR. IN ADDITION, REFER TO NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HEREIN FOR

A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY.

OTHER REVENUES

OTHER REVENUES IN 2013 INCLUDED A $20 MILLION GAIN FROM THE SALE OF RENEWAL RIGHTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013 RELATED TO THE

COMPANY'S NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP) BUSINESS. THE COMPANY WAS A PARTICIPANT IN THE NFIP WRITE YOUR OWN (WYO) PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA) AND

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2013 WERE $4.33 BILLION, $1.18 BILLION OR 21% LOWER THAN IN 2012. THE DECREASE

PRIMARILY REFLECTED (I) LOWER CATASTROPHE LOSSES, (II) LOWER NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES, (III) THE IMPACT OF LOWER VOLUMES OF INSURED EXPOSURES AND (IV) HIGHER

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (V) THE IMPACT OF LOSS COST TRENDS. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2013 AND 2012 WERE $250 MILLION AND $1.02 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2013 AND 2012 WAS $209 MILLION AND $175 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 7 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2012 WERE $5.50 BILLION, $837 MILLION OR 13% LOWER THAN IN 2011. THE DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED (I) LOWER CATASTROPHE

LOSSES, (II) LOWER NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES, (III) LOWER FIRE-RELATED LOSSES AND (IV) HIGHER NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

(V) THE IMPACT OF LOSS COST TRENDS, INCLUDING A HIGHER NUMBER OF SEVERE BODILY INJURY CLAIMS IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2012 WERE $1.02 BILLION,

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS IN 2013 WAS $1.29 BILLION, $152 MILLION OR 11% LOWER THAN IN 2012. THE

DECREASE IN 2013 REFLECTED (I) THE DECLINE IN EARNED PREMIUMS COMPARED WITH 2012, (II) A RECLASSIFICATION OF FEE INCOME RELATED TO THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM FROM GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO A COMPONENT OF ACQUISITION COSTS TO CONFORM TO THE PRESENTATION PRESCRIBED BY INSURANCE REGULATORS, AND (III) LOWER FIXED-VALUE COMMISSION EXPENSE. AMORTIZATION OF

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS IN 2012 WAS $1.44 BILLION, $21 MILLION OR 1% LOWER THAN IN 2011, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER FIXED-VALUE COMMISSION EXPENSE. THE LOWER FIXED-VALUE COMMISSION

EXPENSE IN 2013 RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF AGENTS REVERTING TO A CONTINGENT COMMISSION COMPENSATION PROGRAM (THE COSTS OF WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED IN "GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES")

FROM A FIXED-VALUE COMPENSATION PROGRAM (THE COSTS OF WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED IN "AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS").

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2013 WERE $980 MILLION, $80 MILLION OR 9% HIGHER THAN IN 2012. THE INCREASE IN

2013 INCLUDED AN INCREASE IN CONTINGENT COMMISSION EXPENSE DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF AGENTS REVERTING TO A CONTINGENT COMMISSION COMPENSATION PROGRAM AND THE IMPACT OF THE RECLASSIFICATION

OF FEE INCOME DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE INCREASE IN 2013 ALSO INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF $12 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF SEVERANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S ANNOUNCED

PLAN TO REDUCE CERTAIN CLAIM AND OTHER INSURANCE EXPENSES IN THIS SEGMENT. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN ADVERTISING EXPENSE. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2012 WERE

$900 MILLION, $8 MILLION OR 1% LOWER THAN IN 2011.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN 2013 WAS $366 MILLION, $334 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2012, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACTS OF THE

$953 MILLION INCREASE IN UNDERWRITING MARGINS (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF A DECREASE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND THE INCREASE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND A REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF

$5 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS IN 2013. INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN 2012 WAS $32 MILLION, COMPARED TO

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AN

INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $293 MILLION IN 2011. THE CHANGE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $325 MILLION IN 2012 FROM 2011 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE $898 MILLION DECREASE IN UNDERWRITING

LOSS (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF A DECREASE IN CATASTROPHES AND AN INCREASE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT) FROM 2011, AS WELL AS THE REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF

$10 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS IN 2011.

THE

LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 59.1% IN 2013 WAS 13.2 POINTS LOWER THAN THE 2012 RATIO OF 72.3%. CATASTROPHE LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR 3.4 AND 13.4 POINTS OF THE LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT PROVIDED 2.8 POINTS AND 2.3 POINTS OF BENEFIT TO THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN

2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2013 UNDERLYING LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO WAS 2.7 POINTS LOWER THAN THE 2012 RATIO ON THE SAME BASIS, REFLECTING THE IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERLYING

UNDERWRITING MARGINS DISCUSSED IN THE "OVERVIEW" SECTION ABOVE.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 29.8% IN 2013 WAS 0.2 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 29.6% IN 2012. THE INCREASE IN 2013 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE DECREASE IN

EARNED PREMIUMS AND THE EXPENSE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS THAT HAVE

EXPANDED INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AND CONTINUES TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS

FROM THE COMPANY'S POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY). FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS INCLUDE CONTINUED INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS

CLAIMANTS AND THE CONTINUED FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION. THE FOCUS ON THESE DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF

TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY

OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES BY INITIALLY DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. THE BANKRUPTCY OF MANY

TRADITIONAL DEFENDANTS HAS ALSO CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO

ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE

MANIFESTATION ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET. PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT

TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION, CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENT PATTERNS EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE EXPERIENCE ALSO HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE

UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR

A PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED

AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDER'S FAVOR

AND OTHER COMPANY DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, THE COMPANY'S COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND

THE NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS SEEN A MODERATION IN THE OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT

THE ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

MANY

COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN

ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. THERE ALSO MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE A COURT MAY NOT APPROVE A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FOR THE

COMPANY. AS IN THE PAST, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN

ADDITION TO CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO

THE HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY, COULD BE MADE IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS

BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THESE CLAIMS AND HAS RECEIVED FAVORABLE RULINGS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.

TPC

HAD ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES, IN CONNECTION WITH A NUMBER OF THESE DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS (DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENTS). FOR A

FULL DISCUSSION OF THESE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, SEE THE "ASBESTOS DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION" SECTION OF NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AT LEAST ANNUALLY. AMONG THE FACTORS

WHICH THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER IN THE COURSE OF THIS REVIEW ARE: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS

AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT

VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS;

AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE LIMIT AND

THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM.

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IN-DEPTH ASBESTOS CLAIM REVIEW, INCLUDING A REVIEW OF ACTIVE POLICYHOLDERS AND LITIGATION CASES FOR POTENTIAL PRODUCT AND

"NON-PRODUCT" LIABILITY, AND NOTED THE CONTINUATION OF THE FOLLOWING TRENDS.



CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS INVOLVING INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS

ASBESTOS-RELATED ILLNESS;



WHILE OVERALL PAYMENT PATTERNS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY STABLE, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN SEVERITY FOR CERTAIN

POLICYHOLDERS DUE TO THE CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY;



CONTINUED MODERATE LEVEL OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCY ACTIVITY; AND



THE ABSENCE OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR NEW CLASSES OF DEFENDANTS.

WHILE

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REDUCTION IN THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S OVERALL ASBESTOS EXPOSURE, THERE NONETHELESS

REMAINS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE FROM ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

THE

HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE CATEGORIES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICYHOLDERS WITH ACTIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS, EXPERIENCED A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS WITH OPEN

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2012, WHILE NET ASBESTOS-RELATED PAYMENTS IN THESE CATEGORIES DECREASED SLIGHTLY IN 2013 COMPARED WITH 2012. PAYMENTS ON

BEHALF OF POLICYHOLDERS IN THESE CATEGORIES CONTINUE TO BE INFLUENCED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WHERE INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS ASBESTOS-RELATED

INJURY CONTINUE TO TARGET DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION.

THE

COMPANY'S QUARTERLY ASBESTOS RESERVE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANALYZES DEVELOPING PAYMENT PATTERNS AMONG POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE, FIELD OFFICE AND ASSUMED REINSURANCE AND OTHER

EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES NOR HAVE THE COMPANY'S

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ESTIMATE

OF PROJECTED SETTLEMENT AND DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO A BROAD NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE CATEGORY AND BY HIGHER PROJECTED PAYMENTS ON ASSUMED REINSURANCE ACCOUNTS. THE INCREASE

IN THE ESTIMATE OF PROJECTED SETTLEMENT AND DEFENSE COSTS RESULTED FROM PAYMENT TRENDS THAT CONTINUE TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT LITIGATION

ENVIRONMENT DISCUSSED ABOVE. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE TRENDS, THE COMPANY'S OVERALL VIEW OF THE UNDERLYING ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM RECENT PERIODS, AND THERE REMAINS A HIGH

DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

NET

ASBESTOS LOSSES PAID IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011 WERE $218 MILLION, $236 MILLION AND $284 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. APPROXIMATELY 1%, 6% AND 19% OF TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES

IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANY'S LIABILITY.

THE

"POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS" CATEGORY INCLUDES STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS, COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS AND, WITH RESPECT TO TPC, WELLINGTON ACCOUNTS. RESERVES ARE BASED

ON THE EXPECTED PAYOUT FOR EACH POLICYHOLDER UNDER THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENT. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS ARE ARRANGEMENTS UNDER WHICH POLICYHOLDERS AND/OR PLAINTIFFS AGREE TO FIXED FINANCIAL AMOUNTS TO BE

PAID AT SCHEDULED TIMES. COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS REPRESENT AGREEMENTS WITH POLICYHOLDERS ON SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE TO BE PROVIDED. PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL MAXIMUMS

AND ARE ONLY MADE WHEN VALID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED. WELLINGTON ACCOUNTS REFER TO THE 35 DEFENDANTS THAT ARE PARTIES TO A 1985 AGREEMENT SETTLING CERTAIN DISPUTES CONCERNING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEIR

ASBESTOS CLAIMS. MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF THE WELLINGTON AGREEMENT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED ON SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE AND THE TERMS

UNDER WHICH THE COVERAGE CAN BE ACCESSED.

THE

"HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE" CATEGORY RELATES TO ALL OTHER POLICYHOLDERS AND ALSO INCLUDES UNALLOCATED IBNR RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR THE COSTS OF DEFENDING ASBESTOS-RELATED

COVERAGE LITIGATION. POLICYHOLDERS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR THE ANNUAL HOME OFFICE REVIEW BASED UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: A COMBINATION OF PAST PAYMENTS AND CURRENT CASE RESERVES IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED

THRESHOLD (CURRENTLY $100,000), PERCEIVED LEVEL OF EXPOSURE, NUMBER OF REPORTED CLAIMS, PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATIONS AND POTENTIAL "NON-PRODUCT" EXPOSURES, SIZE OF POLICYHOLDER AND GEOGRAPHIC

DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD BY THE POLICYHOLDER. IN ADDITION TO IBNR AMOUNTS CONTAINED IN THE RESERVES FOR "HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE" POLICYHOLDERS AND THE COSTS OF LITIGATING

ASBESTOS COVERAGE MATTERS, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A RESERVE FOR FURTHER ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS, NEW CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS REPORTING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME

AND POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH THERE IS, OR MAY BE, LITIGATION AND DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY. DURING 2012, $502 MILLION OF RESERVES INCLUDED IN "POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS"

WERE RECLASSIFIED TO THE UNALLOCATED IBNR COMPONENT IN THE "HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE" CATEGORY AS A RESULT OF THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT RULING ON MARCH 1, 2012 THAT THE CONDITIONS OF THE

DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENTS HAD NOT BEEN SATISFIED. FOR A FULL DISCUSSION OF THESE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS SEE THE "ASBESTOS DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION" SECTION OF NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE "ASSUMED REINSURANCE AND OTHER" CATEGORY PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF REINSURANCE OF EXCESS COVERAGE, INCLUDING VARIOUS POOL PARTICIPATIONS.

ON

JANUARY 29, 2009, THE COMPANY AND PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. ("PPG"), ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY 30 OTHER INSURERS OF PPG, AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE

ASBESTOS-RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO PPG. THE TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE MODIFIED THIRD AMENDED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION ("AMENDED

PLAN") PROPOSED AS PART OF THE PITTSBURGH CORNING CORP. ("PCC," WHICH IS 50% OWNED BY PPG) BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. PURSUANT TO THE PROPOSED AMENDED PLAN, WHICH WAS FILED ON JANUARY 30, 2009,

PCC, ALONG WITH ENUMERATED OTHER COMPANIES (INCLUDING PPG AS WELL AS THE COMPANY AS A PARTICIPATING INSURER), ARE TO RECEIVE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE FROM

CERTAIN ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO MAKE A SERIES OF PAYMENTS OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY

$620 MILLION TO THE TRUST TO BE CREATED UNDER THE AMENDED PLAN, OR IT MAY ELECT TO MAKE A ONE-TIME DISCOUNTED PAYMENT, WHICH, AS OF MARCH 31, 2014, WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY

$493 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $464 MILLION AFTER REINSURANCE). THE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH PPG IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE AMENDED PLAN,

AND THE COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT UNTIL ALL CONTINGENCIES ARE SATISFIED. THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE ARE INCLUDED IN THE "HOME OFFICE AND

FIELD OFFICE" CATEGORY IN THE PRECEDING TABLE.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AND CONTINUES TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE

ARISING OUT OF THEIR ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE

COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH

RESPECT TO RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE

THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

105

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS HAVE INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT

WERE ISSUED BY THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE MID-1980S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE

MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT BY THE CLAIMANT FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

THE

RESOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES BY THE COMPANY GENERALLY OCCURS THROUGH SETTLEMENTS WITH POLICYHOLDERS AS OPPOSED TO CLAIMANTS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY STRIVES TO EXTINGUISH ANY

OBLIGATIONS IT MAY HAVE UNDER ANY POLICY ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER FOR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXTINGUISH ANY PENDING COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTE WITH THE POLICYHOLDER.

THIS FORM OF SETTLEMENT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A "BUY-BACK" OF POLICIES FOR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE AGREEMENTS HAVE ALSO EXTINGUISHED ANY INSURANCE OBLIGATION

WHICH THE COMPANY MAY HAVE FOR OTHER CLAIMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ASBESTOS AND OTHER CUMULATIVE INJURY CLAIMS. THE COMPANY AND ITS POLICYHOLDERS MAY ALSO AGREE TO SETTLEMENTS WHICH EXTINGUISH

ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM KNOWN SPECIFIED SITES OR CLAIMS. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THESE AGREEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE INDEMNITIES AND HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S GENERAL

PURPOSE IN EXECUTING THESE AGREEMENTS IS TO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE AND ELIMINATE THE RISKS PRESENTED BY COVERAGE LITIGATION WITH THE POLICYHOLDER AND RELATED COSTS.

IN

ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS,

THE COMPANY GENERALLY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF SIMILAR EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY

VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS: THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE

OF THE ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL

NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF

OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN ANY

RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION. THE EVALUATION OF THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY A POLICYHOLDER CAN CHANGE AS INFORMATION CONCERNING THAT POLICYHOLDER AND THE MANY

VARIABLES PRESENTED IS DEVELOPED. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES.

IN

ITS REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS: PAST SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS; CHANGING JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE TRENDS; ITS RESERVES FOR THE COSTS OF LITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL

COVERAGE MATTERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR POLICYHOLDERS WITH SMALLER EXPOSURES TO BE NAMED IN NEW CLEAN-UP ACTIONS FOR BOTH ON-AND OFF-SITE WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES; THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT;

THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL NEW CLAIMS BEYOND PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS; AND THE POTENTIAL HIGHER COSTS FOR NEW SETTLEMENTS.

THE

DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE EXTENT OF TIME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE ESTIMATE, IF ANY, OF THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM TO THE

COMPANY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND ARE DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE COOPERATION OF THE POLICYHOLDER IN PROVIDING CLAIM INFORMATION, THE PACE OF

UNDERLYING LITIGATION OR CLAIM PROCESSES, THE PACE OF COVERAGE LITIGATION BETWEEN THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY TO NEGOTIATE, IF APPROPRIATE,

A RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE PERTAINING TO THESE CLAIMS. BECAUSE THESE FACTORS VARY FROM CLAIM-TO-CLAIM AND POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY CANNOT PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE OF THE DURATION

OF AN

106

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIM. HOWEVER, BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THESE CLAIMS, THE DURATION MAY VARY FROM MONTHS TO SEVERAL YEARS.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE NOTICES FROM POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME, FREQUENTLY UNDER POLICIES ISSUED PRIOR TO THE MID-1980'S. THESE POLICYHOLDERS CONTINUE TO

PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE LOWER TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, IN MANY INSTANCES, CLEAN-UP COSTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT RISK-BASED

SITE ANALYSES AND MORE EFFICIENT CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED

GENERALLY FAVORABLE TRENDS IN THE NUMBER OF NEW POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IN THE NUMBER OF PENDING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS. HOWEVER, THE DEGREE TO WHICH THOSE FAVORABLE TRENDS HAVE CONTINUED HAS BEEN LESS THAN ANTICIPATED. IN ADDITION, RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS HAS BEEN GREATER THAN

ANTICIPATED. AS A RESULT, IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $65 MILLION, $90 MILLION AND $76 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

NET

ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES PAID IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011 WERE $84 MILLION, $84 MILLION AND $86 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, APPROXIMATELY 91% OF

THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $314 MILLION) WAS CARRIED IN A BULK RESERVE AND INCLUDED UNRESOLVED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE

ANTICIPATED COST OF COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTES RELATING TO THESE CLAIMS. THE BULK RESERVE THE COMPANY CARRIES IS ESTABLISHED AND ADJUSTED BASED UPON THE AGGREGATE VOLUME OF IN-PROCESS ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS AND THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THOSE CLAIMS. THE BALANCE, APPROXIMATELY 9% OF THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION), CONSISTS OF CASE RESERVES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DISCUSSED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY

IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE, AND/OR THE NUMBER OF, ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED, THE EMERGENCE OF A GREATER NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS THAN ANTICIPATED AS A RESULT OF EXTENDED LIFE EXPECTANCIES RESULTING FROM MEDICAL ADVANCES

AND LIFESTYLE IMPROVEMENTS, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS

AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING

TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH

EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS. IN ADDITION, UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS

ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS ENVIRONMENT COULD BE

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION AND FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR JUDICIAL REFORMS

ESTABLISHING MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A

LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE

IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS. (ALSO SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WERE $73.16 BILLION, OF WHICH 93% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, 1% IN EQUITY SECURITIES, 1% IN REAL ESTATE AND 5% IN OTHER INVESTMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF DOMINION, TOTAL INVESTMENTS INCREASED BY $2.62 BILLION AT

NOVEMBER 1, 2013, OF WHICH $1.83 BILLION WERE FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. BECAUSE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS TO FUND FUTURE CLAIMS PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A

CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, TAX-EXEMPT

U.S. MUNICIPAL AND TAXABLE CORPORATE AND U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS.

THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WAS $63.96 BILLION. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY

INVESTMENTS, AND INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES ARE EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO

108

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SATISFY

THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, BOTH INCLUDING AND EXCLUDING U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, WAS "AA2" AT

BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012. BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES REPRESENTED 3.0% AND 3.1% OF THE TOTAL FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF FIXED MATURITIES AND SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WAS 3.7 (3.9 EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM SECURITIES) AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 3.2 (3.4 EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM SECURITIES) AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012. THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITIES AND SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WHEN COMPARED TO YEAR-END 2012

PRIMARILY REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES DURING 2013. SEE THE "OUTLOOK" SECTION IN "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS."

ISSUER OR THE INSURER IN THE CASE OF SECURITIES ENHANCED BY THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF ISSUER DEFAULT.

THE

COMPANY BASES ITS INVESTMENT DECISION ON THE UNDERLYING CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MUNICIPAL SECURITY. WHILE ITS MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF SECURITIES THAT WERE

ENHANCED BY THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF AN ISSUER DEFAULT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RELY ON ENHANCED CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS PROVIDED BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY

INSURANCE AS PART OF ITS INVESTING DECISIONS. OF THE INSURED MUNICIPAL SECURITIES IN THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, APPROXIMATELY 99% WERE RATED AT "A3" OR ABOVE, AND

APPROXIMATELY 91% WERE RATED AT "AA3" OR ABOVE, WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A LOSS OF THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE WOULD NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE UNDERLYING CREDIT STRENGTH OF THE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE

SECURITIES. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE UNDERLYING ISSUERS OF THESE SECURITIES WAS "AA2" AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE ENTIRE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO WAS "AA1" AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013 WITH AND WITHOUT THE ENHANCEMENT PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE.

RATED

USING EXTERNAL RATING AGENCIES OR BY THE COMPANY WHEN A PUBLIC RATING DOES NOT EXIST. THE TABLE INCLUDES $116 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM SECURITIES

WHICH HAVE THE HIGHEST RATINGS ISSUED BY EXTERNAL RATING AGENCIES FOR SHORT-TERM ISSUANCES. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS TABLE, THE SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, WHICH ARE RATED "A-1+" AND/OR "P-1," ARE INCLUDED AS

"AAA" RATED SECURITIES.

IN

ADDITION TO FIXED MATURITIES NOTED IN THE FOREGOING TABLE, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE TOTALING $267 MILLION TO PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS

(BOTH OF WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET) WHOSE PRIMARY INVESTING FOCUS IS ACROSS EUROPE. THE COMPANY HAS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TOTALING

$178 MILLION TO THESE PARTNERSHIPS. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS $5 MILLION OF NONREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK (INCLUDED IN EQUITY SECURITIES ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET) ISSUED BY

COMPANIES IN THE EUROZONE.

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS AND PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES

THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 INCLUDED $2.42 BILLION AND

$3.00 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, INCLUDING PASS-THROUGH-SECURITIES AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMO), ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT

RISK (EITHER SHORTENING OR LENGTHENING OF DURATION). WHILE PREPAYMENT RISK FOR SECURITIES AND ITS EFFECT ON INCOME CANNOT BE FULLY CONTROLLED, PARTICULARLY WHEN INTEREST RATES MOVE DRAMATICALLY, THE

COMPANY'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY GENERALLY FAVORS SECURITIES THAT REDUCE THIS RISK WITHIN EXPECTED INTEREST RATE RANGES. INCLUDED IN THE TOTALS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 WERE

$1.06 BILLION AND $1.44 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF GNMA, FNMA AND FHLMC (EXCLUDING FHA PROJECT LOANS) GUARANTEED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE FOR SALE. ALSO INCLUDED IN THOSE TOTALS WERE RESIDENTIAL CMOS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $1.36 BILLION AND

114

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$1.56 BILLION,

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. APPROXIMATELY 42% AND 43% OF THE COMPANY'S CMO HOLDINGS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, WERE GUARANTEED BY

OR FULLY COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES ISSUED BY GNMA, FNMA OR FHLMC. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE $790 MILLION AND $893 MILLION OF NON-GUARANTEED CMO HOLDINGS AT DECEMBER 31,

2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, WAS "BA3" AND "B2," RESPECTIVELY. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF ALL OF THE ABOVE SECURITIES WAS "A1" AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012.

THE

COMPANY MAKES INVESTMENTS IN RESIDENTIAL CMOS THAT ARE EITHER GUARANTEED BY GNMA, FNMA OR FHLMC, OR IF NOT GUARANTEED, ARE SENIOR OR SUPER-SENIOR POSITIONS WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE

SECURITIZATIONS. BOTH GUARANTEED AND NON-GUARANTEED RESIDENTIAL CMOS ALLOCATE THE DISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS FROM THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES AMONG DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BONDHOLDERS. IN ADDITION,

NON-GUARANTEED RESIDENTIAL CMOS PROVIDE STRUCTURES THAT ALLOCATE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT LOSSES TO DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BONDHOLDERS. SENIOR AND SUPER-SENIOR CMOS ARE PROTECTED, TO VARYING DEGREES, FROM

CREDIT LOSSES AS THOSE LOSSES ARE INITIALLY ALLOCATED TO SUBORDINATED BONDHOLDERS. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO PURCHASE CMO TRANCHES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OFFER THE MOST FAVORABLE RETURN

GIVEN THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ASSOCIATED RISKS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PURCHASE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN CMOS.

ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION MORTGAGES AND SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDED COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS

BACKED BY ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION MORTGAGES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES WITH A COLLECTIVE FAIR VALUE OF $293 MILLION AND $347 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY (COMPRISING LESS THAN 1% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AT BOTH DATES). THE COMPANY DEFINES SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AS INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING

LOANS PRIMARILY EXHIBIT ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: LOW FICO SCORES, ABOVE-PRIME INTEREST RATES, HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS OR HIGH DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIOS. ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION

SECURITIZATIONS ARE THOSE IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES' REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT SCORE BUT DO NOT MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES' GUIDELINES

FOR DOCUMENTATION, PROPERTY TYPE, DEBT AND LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING ON THESE SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS HELD BY THE COMPANY WAS "BA2" AND "BA1" AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND

2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS PORTFOLIO EXPOSES IT TO A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE PORTFOLIO'S RELATIVELY

SMALL SIZE.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND PROJECT LOANS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, THE COMPANY HELD COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (INCLUDING FHA PROJECT LOANS) OF

$475 MILLION AND $453 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS PORTFOLIO EXPOSES IT TO A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE PORTFOLIO'S RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE AND THE UNDERLYING CREDIT STRENGTH OF THESE SECURITIES.

EQUITY SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, REAL ESTATE AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THESE INVESTED ASSET

CLASSES.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY ALSO INVESTS MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, AND

REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO MORE VOLATILITY THAN THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. THESE ASSET CLASSES HAVE HISTORICALLY PROVIDED A HIGHER RETURN THAN

FIXED MATURITIES BUT ARE SUBJECT TO MORE VOLATILITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER INVESTMENTS WAS $3.44 BILLION AND $3.43 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SECURITIES LENDING

THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES NET INVESTMENT INCOME BY LENDING CERTAIN OF ITS

INVESTMENTS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, THE COMPANY HAD $131 MILLION AND $403 MILLION OF SECURITIES ON LOAN, RESPECTIVELY, AS

PART OF A TRI-PARTY LENDING AGREEMENT. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY BALANCE OF SECURITIES ON LOAN DURING 2013 AND 2012 WAS $168 MILLION AND $197 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. BORROWERS OF THESE

SECURITIES PROVIDE COLLATERAL EQUAL TO AT LEAST 102% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCURRED ANY INVESTMENT LOSSES IN ITS SECURITIES LENDING

PROGRAM FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011.

LLOYD'S TRUST DEPOSIT

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A LLOYD'S TRUST DEPOSIT, WHEREBY OWNED SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $181 MILLION HELD BY A

ACHIEVE

ITS PRIMARY INVESTMENT GOALS OF ASSURING THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS TO OPTIMIZE INVESTMENT RETURNS, GIVEN THESE OBLIGATIONS.

CATASTROPHE MODELING

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY AND THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER MODELING PROCESSES, TO ANALYZE

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. THE COMPANY USES THESE ANALYSES AND METHODS TO MAKE UNDERWRITING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHIC

EVENTS. THERE ARE NO INDUSTRY-STANDARD METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS FOR PROJECTING CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE. ACCORDINGLY, CATASTROPHE ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY DIFFERENT INSURERS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE.

THE

COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS AND EVALUATES CHANGES IN THIRD-PARTY MODELS AND, WHEN NECESSARY, CALIBRATES THE CATASTROPHE RISK MODEL ESTIMATES DELIVERED VIA ITS OWN PROPRIETARY MODELING

PROCESSES.

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, RECENT EVENTS, UNDERWRITING PRACTICES, MARKET SHARE ANALYSES, EXTERNAL SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS TO ACCOUNT FOR NON-MODELED LOSSES

TO REFINE ITS PROPRIETARY VIEW OF CATASTROPHE RISK. THESE PROPRIETARY MODELS ARE CONTINUALLY UPDATED AS NEW INFORMATION EMERGES.

THE

TABLES BELOW SET FORTH THE PROBABILITIES THAT ESTIMATED LOSSES, COMPRISING CLAIMS AND ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES (BUT EXCLUDING UNALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES), FROM

A SINGLE EVENT OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME WILL EQUAL OR EXCEED THE INDICATED LOSS AMOUNTS (EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY), BASED ON THE CURRENT VERSION

OF THE PROPRIETARY AND THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER MODELS UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE BASIS DESCRIBED BELOW THE TABLES, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THERE IS A ONE

PERCENT CHANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S LOSS FROM A SINGLE U.S. HURRICANE IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME WOULD EQUAL OR EXCEED $1.3 BILLION, OR 6% OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2013.

EVENT THAT HAS, FOR EXAMPLE, A 2% LIKELIHOOD OF EXCEEDANCE IS SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS A "1-IN-50 YEAR EVENT." AS NOTED ABOVE, HOWEVER, THE

PROBABILITIES IN THE TABLE REPRESENT THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSSES FROM A SINGLE EVENT EQUALING OR EXCEEDING THE INDICATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME, NOT OVER A MULTI-YEAR TIMEFRAME.

ALSO, BECAUSE THE PROBABILITIES RELATE TO A SINGLE EVENT, THE PROBABILITIES DO NOT ADDRESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN ONE EVENT OCCURRING IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, AND, THEREFORE, THE AMOUNTS DO NOT

ADDRESS POTENTIAL AGGREGATE CATASTROPHE LOSSES OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

PERCENTAGE OF COMMON EQUITY IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING (A) INDICATED LOSS AMOUNTS IN DOLLARS BY (B) TOTAL COMMON EQUITY EXCLUDING NET

UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES. NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY BOTH DISCRETIONARY AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY

INDICATIVE OF OPERATING TRENDS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT USES THE PERCENTAGE OF COMMON EQUITY CALCULATED ON THIS BASIS AS A METRIC TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A SINGLE HURRICANE

OR SINGLE EARTHQUAKE ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION FOR PURPOSES OF MAKING UNDERWRITING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS.

THE

THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS IN THE TABLES ABOVE, WHICH ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY'S IN-FORCE PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE PROGRAM AT JANUARY 1,

2014, ARE NET OF REINSURANCE, AFTER-TAX AND EXCLUDE UNALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN LESS THAN 10% OF LOSS ESTIMATES. THE AMOUNTS FOR HURRICANES REFLECT U.S.

EXPOSURES AND INCLUDE PROPERTY EXPOSURES, PROPERTY RESIDUAL MARKET EXPOSURES AND AN ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN NON-PROPERTY EXPOSURES. THE HURRICANE LOSS AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY'S CATASTROPHE

RISK MODEL ESTIMATES AND INCLUDE LOSSES FROM THE HURRICANE HAZARDS OF WIND AND STORM SURGE. THE AMOUNTS FOR EARTHQUAKES REFLECT U.S. AND CANADIAN PROPERTY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXPOSURES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE INCLUSION OF HURRICANE OR EARTHQUAKE LOSSES ARISING FROM OTHER GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS OR OTHER EXPOSURES WOULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS.

CATASTROPHE

MODELING RELIES UPON INPUTS BASED ON EXPERIENCE, SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND HISTORY. THESE INPUTS REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGES WHICH MAY

RESULT IN VOLATILITY IN THE MODELED OUTPUT. CATASTROPHE MODELING OUTPUT MAY ALSO FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR RISKS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF NORMAL PROBABILITY OR ARE OTHERWISE UNFORESEEABLE. CATASTROPHE

MODELING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE PORTION OF PURCHASED REINSURANCE THAT IS COLLECTIBLE AFTER A CATASTROPHIC EVENT, WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE MATERIALLY INCORRECT. CONSEQUENTLY, CATASTROPHE

MODELING ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. IN THE TABLES ABOVE, THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE LIKELIHOOD OF

EXCEEDANCE DECREASES. IN OTHER WORDS, IN THE CASE OF A RELATIVELY MORE REMOTE EVENT (E.G., 1-IN-1,000), THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT IS RELATIVELY LESS RELIABLE. ACTUAL LOSSES FROM AN

EVENT COULD MATERIALLY EXCEED THE INDICATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT. IN ADDITION, MORE THAN ONE SUCH EVENT COULD OCCUR IN ANY PERIOD.

MOREOVER,

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF MATERIAL LOSSES FROM OTHER THAN PROPERTY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGES ARISING OUT OF HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, AND IT IS EXPOSED

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES FROM PERILS OTHER THAN HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, SUCH AS TORNADOES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS, VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS, TSUNAMIS AND ACTS

OF TERRORISM.

OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS PROVIDE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS."

CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS

SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE UNDERSCORED THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE CLIMATE TRENDS AND CREATED

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING INSURERS' EXPOSURES TO FINANCIAL LOSS AS A RESULT OF CATASTROPHES AND OTHER WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, OVER THE LAST DECADE HURRICANE ACTIVITY HAS IMPACTED AREAS

FURTHER INLAND THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED, THUS EXPANDING THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL FOR LOSSES FROM HURRICANES. ADDITIONALLY, BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TORNADO AND HAIL STORMS IN THE UNITED

STATES HAVE BEEN GREATER IN RECENT YEARS. FURTHER, ANY REDUCTION IN ARCTIC SEA ICE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO RISING SEA LEVELS THAT COULD IMPACT FLOODING IN COASTAL AREAS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY MAY BE

119

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBJECT

TO INCREASED LOSSES FROM CATASTROPHES AND OTHER WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S CATASTROPHE MODELS MAY BE LESS RELIABLE DUE TO THE INCREASED UNPREDICTABILITY, FREQUENCY AND

SEVERITY OF SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS.

THE

COMPANY DISCUSSES HOW POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS MAY PRESENT OTHER ISSUES FOR ITS BUSINESS UNDER "RISK FACTORS" IN ITEM 1A OF THIS REPORT AND UNDER

"OUTLOOK" HEREIN. FOR EXAMPLE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.



INCREASINGLY UNPREDICTABLE AND SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CLAIMS UNDER

POLICIES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY. SEE "RISK FACTORSCATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE" AND "OUTLOOKUNDERWRITING GAIN/LOSS."



CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD ALSO IMPACT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF ISSUERS OF SECURITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY INVESTS.

FOR EXAMPLE, WATER SUPPLY ADEQUACY COULD IMPACT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF BOND ISSUERS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES, AND MORE FREQUENT AND/OR SEVERE HURRICANES COULD IMPACT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF

ISSUERS IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES, AMONG OTHER AREAS. SEE "RISK FACTORSOUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR MATERIAL REALIZED OR UNREALIZED LOSSES."



INCREASED REGULATION ADOPTED IN RESPONSE TO POTENTIAL CHANGES IN CLIMATE CONDITIONS MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY AND ITS

CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, STATE INSURANCE REGULATION COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE PROPERTY EXPOSURES IN AREAS VULNERABLE TO SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE DRIVEN LOSSES. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO

IMPLEMENT RISK BASED PRICING, MODIFY POLICY TERMS OR REDUCE EXPOSURES TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO ADDRESS RISING LOSSES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES AND SMALLER SCALE WEATHER EVENTS (SHOULD THOSE INCREASED

LOSSES OCCUR), ITS BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE "RISK FACTORSCATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR

LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE."



THE FULL RANGE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. THROUGH THE COMPANY'S

EMERGING ISSUES COMMITTEE AND ITS COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY WORKS WITH ITS BUSINESS UNITS AND CORPORATE GROUPS, AS APPROPRIATE, TO IDENTIFY AND TRY TO ASSESS

CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED LIABILITY ISSUES, WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AND OFTEN HARD TO FULLY EVALUATE. SEE "RISK FACTORSTHE EFFECTS OF EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR

BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN."

CLIMATE

CHANGE REGULATION ALSO COULD INCREASE THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS' COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, INSUREDS FACED WITH CARBON MANAGEMENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE LESS

AVAILABLE CAPITAL FOR INVESTMENT IN LOSS PREVENTION AND SAFETY FEATURES WHICH MAY, OVER TIME, INCREASE LOSS EXPOSURES. ALSO, INCREASED REGULATION MAY RESULT IN REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, WHICH WOULD

DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF INSURABLE ASSETS AND BUSINESSES.

THE

COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS EMERGING ISSUES, SUCH AS CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, TO CONSIDER POTENTIAL CHANGES TO ITS MODELING AND THE USE OF SUCH MODELING, AS WELL AS TO HELP

DETERMINE THE NEED FOR NEW UNDERWRITING STRATEGIES, COVERAGE MODIFICATIONS OR NEW PRODUCTS.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS, WHICH ARE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SETTLE CERTAIN PERSONAL

PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE THE COMPANY DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE AMOUNT DUE FROM THE LIFE

INSURANCE COMPANY RELATED TO THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS A REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE AND THE RELATED CLAIM COST IS INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY FOR

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, AS THE COMPANY RETAINS THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IF IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PAY, THE COMPANY WOULD

RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF THE RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE IF, AND TO THE EXTENT, THE PURCHASED ANNUITIES ARE NOT COVERED BY STATE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE

COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPANY'S TOP FIVE GROUPS BY STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS AT

COMPANIES AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY TURBULENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE EVENTS AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CHALLENGES IN

RECENT YEARS. A NUMBER OF SUCH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO DOWNGRADES AND/OR NEGATIVE OUTLOOK CHANGES BY VARIOUS RATINGS AGENCIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS. THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS THESE FACTORS IN ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF ITS ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS.

OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES OUTLOOK INFORMATION FOR CERTAIN KEY DRIVERS OF THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL

POSITION.

PREMIUMS.

THE COMPANY'S EARNED PREMIUMS ARE A FUNCTION OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS COMPRISE BOTH RENEWAL

BUSINESS AND NEW

BUSINESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED PREMIUM OVER THE LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING POLICIES. WHEN BUSINESS RENEWS, THE AMOUNT OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUSINESS MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE

(RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE) AS A RESULT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN RATE AND/OR INSURED EXPOSURES, WHICH THE COMPANY CONSIDERS AS A MEASURE OF UNITS OF EXPOSURE (SUCH AS THE NUMBER AND VALUE OF VEHICLES

OR PROPERTIES INSURED). NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FROM BOTH RENEWAL AND NEW BUSINESS, AND THEREFORE EARNED PREMIUMS, ARE IMPACTED BY COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

WHICH, PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, AFFECT AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, POLICY ENDORSEMENTS AND MID-TERM CANCELLATIONS. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS ARE ALSO IMPACTED BY THE

STRUCTURE OF REINSURANCE PROGRAMS AND RELATED COSTS.

GIVEN

THE POSSIBILITY THAT MORE ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERNS SUCH AS THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED IN A NUMBER OF RECENT PERIODS MAY CONTINUE, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT INTEREST RATES MAY

REMAIN LOW FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME, ALONG WITH THE CURRENT LEVEL OF PROFITABILITY IN CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCT LINES, THE COMPANY HAS UNDERTAKEN VARIOUS EFFORTS, AND EXPECTS TO UNDERTAKE ADDITIONAL

EFFORTS, TO IMPROVE ITS UNDERWRITING MARGINS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE SEEKING IMPROVED RATES WHERE THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS IMPROVED TERMS AND CONDITIONS, ON MANY OF ITS

INSURANCE PRODUCTS, AND ALSO INCLUDE OTHER INITIATIVES, SUCH AS REDUCING OPERATING EXPENSES AND ACQUISITION COSTS. IN THE AGENCY AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS, GIVEN NEW BUSINESS LEVELS, THE COMPANY HAS

UNDERTAKEN VARIOUS ACTIONS (WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "UNDERWRITING GAIN/LOSS" SECTION BELOW) TO REDUCE EXPENSES AND COSTS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE UNDERWRITING MARGINS AND ENABLE IT TO

HAVE A MORE COMPETITIVELY PRICED PRODUCT. THESE AND OTHER ACTIONS TO IMPROVE PROFITABILITY WITH RESPECT TO AGENCY AUTOMOBILE OR THE COMPANY'S OTHER BUSINESS UNITS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND/OR MAY

RESULT IN LOWER RETENTION AND NEW BUSINESS LEVELS AND THEREFORE LOWER BUSINESS VOLUMES. IF THESE ACTIONS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, THE COMPANY MAY NEED TO EXPLORE OTHER ACTIONS OR INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE ITS

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND PROFITABILITY. REFER TO "PART IITEM 1ARISK FACTORSTHE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN

OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY" AND "DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US."

122

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OVERALL,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS RETENTION LEVELS (THE AMOUNT OF EXPIRING PREMIUM THAT RENEWS, BEFORE THE IMPACT OF RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES) WILL REMAIN STRONG RELATIVE TO HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE, IN THE AGGREGATE, PRICE INCREASES ON RENEWAL BUSINESS DURING 2014 THAT EXCEED LOSS COST TRENDS. IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS THAT RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES DURING 2014 WILL BE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LEVELS ATTAINED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013 AND WILL BE DRIVEN BY BOTH POSITIVE RENEWAL RATE CHANGES AND,

SUBJECT TO THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES DISCUSSED BELOW, GROWTH IN INSURED EXPOSURES. IN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT RENEWAL PREMIUM

CHANGES DURING 2014 WILL BE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH 2013. WITH RESPECT TO SURETY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUMES DURING 2014 THAT ARE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH 2013. IN THE PERSONAL

INSURANCE SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS BOTH AGENCY AUTOMOBILE AND AGENCY HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES DURING 2014 WILL DECLINE AS COMPARED TO 2013, BUT THE COMPANY EXPECTS SUCH RENEWAL

PREMIUM CHANGES WILL REMAIN POSITIVE AND EXCEED UNDERLYING LOSS COST TRENDS, ASSUMING WEATHER PATTERNS AND OTHER LOSS TRENDS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS. RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES FOR

BOTH AGENCY AUTOMOBILE AND AGENCY HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER IN 2014 ARE EXPECTED TO BE DRIVEN BY BOTH POSITIVE RENEWAL RATE CHANGES (BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ACTIONS TO FILE FOR RATE INCREASES) AND, SUBJECT

TO THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES DISCUSSED BELOW, GROWTH IN INSURED EXPOSURES. THE NEED FOR STATE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR CHANGES TO PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRICES, AS WELL AS

COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS, MAY IMPACT THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES.

THE

PRICING ENVIRONMENT FOR NEW BUSINESS GENERALLY HAS LESS OF AN IMPACT ON UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY THAN RENEWAL RATE CHANGES, GIVEN THE VOLUME OF NEW BUSINESS RELATIVE TO RENEWAL

BUSINESS. PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE DURING 2014 FOR NEW BUSINESS, NOT ONLY IN BUSINESS INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL &

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE, BUT ESPECIALLY IN PERSONAL INSURANCE, WHERE PRICE COMPARISON TECHNOLOGY USED BY AGENTS AND BROKERS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS "COMPARATIVE RATERS," HAS FACILITATED THE PROCESS

OF GENERATING MULTIPLE QUOTES, THEREBY INCREASING PRICE COMPARISON ON NEW BUSINESS AND, INCREASINGLY, ON RENEWAL BUSINESS.

MODEST

ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE UNITED STATES EXPERIENCED IN RECENT PERIODS MAY OR MAY NOT CONTINUE, OR MAY CONTINUE AT A SLOWER RATE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN ADDITION, SOME

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT RATES, MAY CONTINUE TO BE WEAK. FUTURE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, SUCH AS A FAILURE TO INCREASE THE GOVERNMENT DEBT LIMIT OR A

SHUTDOWN OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, COULD INCREASE THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RISK THAT THE U.S. MAY NOT ULTIMATELY PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE AND MAY DISRUPT FINANCIAL MARKETS. FURTHER, GENERAL

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL BUDGET AND TAXES, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HAS ADDED TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY.

IF WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS PERSIST OR DETERIORATE, THE RESULTING LOW LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD IMPACT EXPOSURE CHANGES AT RENEWAL AND THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO WRITE BUSINESS AT ACCEPTABLE

RATES. ADDITIONALLY, LOW LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, POLICY ENDORSEMENTS AND MID-TERM CANCELLATIONS AFTER POLICIES ARE WRITTEN. ALL OF THE FOREGOING,

IN TURN, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS DURING 2014, AND BECAUSE EARNED PREMIUMS ARE A FUNCTION OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS, EARNED PREMIUMS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN 2014.

UNDERWRITING GAIN/LOSS.

THE COMPANY'S UNDERWRITING GAIN/LOSS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY

CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND NET FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS.

CATASTROPHE

AND OTHER WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE AND OTHER WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES IN A

NUMBER OF RECENT PERIODS WHICH ADVERSELY IMPACTED ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE AND OTHER

WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES WERE TO OCCUR DURING 2014.

123

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR

THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS HAVE INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, ALTHOUGH AT LOWER LEVELS IN SOME RECENT YEARS, DRIVEN

BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ALL OF THE COMPANY'S SEGMENTS. THE LOWER LEVEL OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN A NUMBER OF RECENT PERIODS MAY HAVE BEEN IN PART DUE TO THE

COMPANY'S RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS INCORPORATING THOSE FACTORS THAT LED TO THE HIGHER LEVELS OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IF THAT TREND CONTINUES, THE BETTER

THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE MAY CONTINUE AT THESE RECENT LOWER LEVELS, OR EVEN LOWER LEVELS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY IN ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, LOSS

EXPERIENCE COULD DEVELOP SUCH THAT THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES HIGHER OR LOWER LEVELS OF FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, NO FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OR UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, THE ONGOING REVIEW OF PRIOR YEAR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, OR OTHER CHANGES IN CURRENT PERIOD CIRCUMSTANCES, MAY RESULT IN THE

COMPANY REVISING CURRENT YEAR LOSS ESTIMATES UPWARD OR DOWNWARD IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE CURRENT YEAR.

IN

BUSINESS INSURANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF INCREASES IN RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONSISTENT MODEST LOSS COST TRENDS, AND ASSUMING

WEATHER PATTERNS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS, WILL LIKELY RESULT IN UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS DURING 2014 THAT ARE HIGHER THAN IN 2013.

IN

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS IN 2014 WILL BE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH 2013 AS THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF

RECENT UNDERWRITING ACTIONS AND POSITIVE RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES WILL BE OFFSET BY CONSISTENT MODEST LOSS COST TRENDS AND THE INCLUSION OF DOMINION. THIS ALSO ASSUMES THAT WEATHER PATTERNS AND WHAT

THE COMPANY DEFINES AS LARGE LOSSES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS. WHILE THE COMPANY IS TAKING ACTIONS TO IMPROVE PROFITABILITY AT DOMINION, IT WILL BE A NUMBER OF YEARS BEFORE THESE

ACTIONS, TO THE EXTENT SUCCESSFUL, WILL BE FULLY REALIZED.

IN

PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS DURING 2014 THAT ARE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH 2013. IN AGENCY AUTOMOBILE, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES AN

IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS DURING 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 DUE TO THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF CONTINUED POSITIVE RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES, COMBINED WITH THE COMPANY'S ANNOUNCED PLAN TO

REDUCE CERTAIN CLAIM ADJUSTMENT AND OTHER INSURANCE EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSS COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED LAUNCH OF QUANTUM AUTO 2.0, AS DISCUSSED BELOW,

WILL INCREASE NEW BUSINESS PREMIUMS BUT WILL NOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS DURING 2014. IN AGENCY HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES A MODEST DECLINE IN

UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS DURING 2014 COMPARED TO 2013, REFLECTING A RETURN TO NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSS LEVELS AND LOSS COST TRENDS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF CONTINUED POSITIVE RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES. ALSO IN PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE COMPANY'S DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE, THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL THAT THE

COMPANY LAUNCHED IN 2009, WHILE INTENDED TO ENHANCE THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN A CONSUMER-DRIVEN MARKETPLACE, IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNPROFITABLE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

AS THIS BOOK OF BUSINESS GROWS AND MATURES.

THE

AGENCY AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE USE OF PRICE COMPARISON TECHNOLOGY BY AGENTS AND BROKERS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE

COMPANY'S ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ANNOUNCED PLAN TO REDUCE CERTAIN CLAIM ADJUSTMENT AND OTHER INSURANCE EXPENSES, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE IMPACT IN THE

AGENCY AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS. THAT PLAN IS INTENDED TO RESULT IN SAVINGS OF $140 MILLION PRE-TAX PER YEAR BY 2015 WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED. IT WILL ALSO RESULT IN A RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF

APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION, $12 MILLION OF WHICH WAS INCURRED IN 2013. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED A NEW PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT,

QUANTUM AUTO 2.0. THIS PRODUCT, IN ADDITION TO INCORPORATING THE COST SAVINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE, HAS A LOWER BASE COMMISSION RATE THAN THE COMPANY'S EXISTING QUANTUM AUTO 1.0 PRODUCT. THESE CHANGES IN

COST STRUCTURE ARE INTENDED TO ENABLE

124

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY TO PRICE QUANTUM AUTO 2.0 MORE COMPETITIVELY WHILE GENERATING AN EXPECTED APPROPRIATE RETURN. THE NEW PRODUCT WAS LAUNCHED IN 18 STATES BY DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND IS EXPECTED TO BE

EVENTUALLY OFFERED IN ALL BUT THREE STATES BEFORE THE END OF 2014. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY INTENDS THAT, IN APPROVED STATES, ALL NEW ACCOUNTS WILL BE ON THE NEW PRODUCT; IN ADDITION, THE PRODUCT WILL

ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO AGENTS AT THEIR DISCRETION FOR EXISTING ACCOUNTS.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ITS INVESTMENT STRATEGY ON MAINTAINING A HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND A

RELATIVELY SHORT AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION. THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF FIXED MATURITIES AND SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WAS 3.7 (3.9 EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM SECURITIES) AT DECEMBER 31, 2013.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS TO MANAGE THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES ITS INVESTMENT

ALTERNATIVES AND MIX. CURRENTLY, THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS ARE

COMPRISED OF A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY, LIQUID TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL AND TAXABLE CORPORATE AND U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS.

THE

COMPANY ALSO INVESTS MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES. THESE

INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER DEGREES OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND LESS LIQUIDITY.

NET

INVESTMENT INCOME IS A MATERIAL CONTRIBUTOR TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. INTEREST RATES REMAIN AT VERY LOW LEVELS BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS. BASED ON THE CURRENT INTEREST

RATE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE IMPACT OF LOWER REINVESTMENT YIELDS ON THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO COULD, IN 2014, RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION OF LOWER

AFTER-TAX NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THAT PORTFOLIO ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. GIVEN RECENT GENERAL ECONOMIC AND INVESTMENT MARKET CONDITIONS, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE NON-FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO IN 2014 WILL BE LOWER THAN IN 2013. IF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND/OR INVESTMENT MARKET CONDITIONS DETERIORATE DURING 2014,

THE COMPANY COULD ALSO EXPERIENCE A FURTHER REDUCTION IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND/OR SIGNIFICANT REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES, INCLUDING IMPAIRMENTS. FUTURE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES

GOVERNMENT, SUCH AS A FAILURE TO INCREASE THE GOVERNMENT DEBT LIMIT OR A SHUTDOWN OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, COULD INCREASE THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RISK THAT THE U.S. MAY NOT ULTIMATELY PAY ITS

OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE AND MAY DISRUPT FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

AUTHORITIES WAS $2.32 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. ADDITIONALLY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS

INCLUDED PRE-REFUNDED BONDS OF $9.52 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. PRE-REFUNDED BONDS ARE BONDS FOR WHICH STATES OR MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ESTABLISHED IRREVOCABLE TRUSTS, ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY

COMPRISED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, WHICH WERE CREATED TO SATISFY THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, SEE

"INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO." FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS DURING OR FOLLOWING A FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION AND RISKS TO THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, SEE THE RISK FACTORS

ENTITLED "DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED" AND "OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED

RETURNS OR MATERIAL REALIZED OR UNREALIZED LOSSES" INCLUDED IN "PART IITEM 1ARISK FACTORS."

CAPITAL POSITION.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS A STRONG CAPITAL POSITION AND, AS PART OF ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE,

EXPECTS TO

CONTINUE TO RETURN CAPITAL NOT NEEDED TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT, GENERALLY OVER TIME, THE COMBINATION OF DIVIDENDS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND

COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES WILL LIKELY NOT EXCEED OPERATING INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE TIMING AND ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, EARNINGS, SHARE PRICE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES, MAINTAINING CAPITAL LEVELS COMMENSURATE WITH THE COMPANY'S

THE

COMPANY HAD A NET AFTER-TAX UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN OF $1.15 BILLION IN ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. WHILE THE COMPANY DOES NOT

ATTEMPT TO PREDICT FUTURE INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS, A RISING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WOULD REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, AND A

DECLINING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WOULD HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECTS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS DURING OR FOLLOWING A FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION AND RISKS TO THE

COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, SEE THE RISK FACTORS ENTITLED "DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO MEET THE CASH REQUIREMENTS OF ITS BUSINESS

OPERATIONS AND TO SATISFY GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES WHEN NEEDED.

OPERATING COMPANY LIQUIDITY.

THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED

FROM PREMIUMS,

FEES, INCOME RECEIVED ON INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT

MATURITIES. CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES' LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS CAN BE

IMPACTED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CATASTROPHE CLAIMS, WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AS WELL AS THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE RECOVERIES, WHICH MAY BE AFFECTED BY

REINSURER SOLVENCY AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE DISPUTES. ADDITIONALLY, THE VARIABILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIM PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS THE VOLATILITY OF POTENTIAL JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS ARISING OUT OF

LITIGATION, MAY ALSO RESULT IN INCREASED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT THAT THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES' FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS WILL BE ADEQUATELY MET FROM ALL

OF SOURCES DESCRIBED ABOVE. SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED, THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR

RESPECTIVE PARENT COMPANIES, WHICH IN TURN PAY DIVIDENDS TO THE CORPORATE HOLDING (PARENT) COMPANY (TRV). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS PAID BY THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES, SEE PART IITEM 1REGULATION."

HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY.

TRV'S LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS, DEBT SERVICING, COMMON SHARE

REPURCHASES AND, FROM

TIME TO TIME, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, TRV HELD TOTAL CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTED ASSETS IN THE UNITED STATES AGGREGATING

$1.59 BILLION AND HAVING A WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF 84 DAYS. THESE ASSETS ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET TRV'S CURRENT LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND ARE IN EXCESS OF TRV'S MINIMUM TARGET LEVEL,

WHICH COMPRISES TRV'S ESTIMATED ANNUAL PRETAX INTEREST EXPENSE AND COMMON SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS, AND CURRENTLY TOTALS APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION.

126

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRV IS NOT DEPENDENT ON DIVIDENDS OR OTHER FORMS OF REPATRIATION FROM ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS. U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN

RECOGNIZED ON $714 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS' UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, AS SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE

OPERATIONS. FURTHERMORE, TAXES PAID TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ON THESE EARNINGS MAY BE USED AS CREDITS AGAINST THE U.S. TAX ON DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE

HOLDING COMPANY. THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED TAXES ON THOSE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013.

TRV

HAS A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WHICH PERMITS IT TO ISSUE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME. TRV ALSO HAS A $1.0 BILLION LINE OF

CREDIT FACILITY WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT EXPIRES IN JUNE 2018. THIS LINE OF CREDIT ALSO SUPPORTS TRV'S $800 MILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, OF WHICH $100 MILLION

WAS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. TRV IS NOT RELIANT ON ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM TO MEET ITS OPERATING CASH FLOW NEEDS.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZED UNCOLLATERALIZED LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED BY MAJOR BANKS WITH AN AGGREGATE LIMIT OF APPROXIMATELY $206 MILLION, TO PROVIDE A PORTION OF THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO

SUPPORT ITS OBLIGATIONS AT LLOYD'S AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. IF UNCOLLATERALIZED LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE PRICE OR AT ALL IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY CAN COLLATERALIZE

THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT OR MAY HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF SUPPORTING ITS OBLIGATIONS AT LLOYD'S, WHICH COULD INCLUDE UTILIZING HOLDING COMPANY FUNDS ON HAND.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE $3.82 BILLION, $3.23 BILLION AND $2.17 BILLION IN 2013, 2012

AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. CASH FLOWS IN 2013 PRIMARILY REFLECTED A DECREASE IN LOSSES PAID RELATED TO CATASTROPHES AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF COLLECTED PREMIUMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAX

PAYMENTS. CASH FLOWS IN 2012 PRIMARILY REFLECTED A DECREASE IN LOSSES PAID RELATED TO CATASTROPHES, A LOWER LEVEL OF PAID LOSSES RELATED TO ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF AND A HIGHER LEVEL

OF COLLECTED PREMIUMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PAID LOSSES RELATED TO NON-CATASTROPHE ONGOING BUSINESS (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF INCREASED LOSS COSTS). IN 2013, THE COMPANY MADE NO

CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN, WHICH WAS 106% FUNDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. IN 2012 AND 2011, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $217 MILLION AND

$185 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO ITS QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2013 AND 2012 WERE $910 MILLION AND $972 MILLION, COMPARED WITH NET CASH

FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $1.15 BILLION IN 2011. THE 2013 TOTAL INCLUDED $997 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF DOMINION (NET OF CASH ACQUIRED). THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 DECREASED BY $678 MILLION, OR 1% FROM YEAR-END 2012, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN NET

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES, COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES AND THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF DOMINION.

ON

DECEMBER 5, 2012, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS OWNERSHIP IN J. MALUCELLI PARTICIPAÇÕES EM SEGUROS E RESSEGUROS S.A, ITS BRAZILIAN JOINT VENTURE

(JMALUCELLI), THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF A PRE-EXISTING OPTION. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS OWNERSHIP TO 49.5% OF THE VENTURE. JMALUCELLI IS CURRENTLY THE MARKET LEADER IN SURETY IN BRAZIL

BASED ON MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT WAS FUNDED WITH CASH PROVIDED INTERNALLY FROM AN OPERATING SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY.

THE

COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO SUPPORT ITS INSURANCE OPERATIONS; ACCORDINGLY, THE PORTFOLIO IS POSITIONED TO MEET OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS. AS SUCH, THE PRIMARY

GOALS OF THE

127

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANY'S

ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS ARE TO SATISFY THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER FLUCTUATIONS IN PROJECTED LIABILITY CASH FLOWS. GENERALLY, THE EXPECTED

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO ADEQUATELY FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EXACT CASH FLOW

MATCH IN EACH PERIOD, THE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT BY WHICH THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM NEWLY

SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUND CLAIM PAYMENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE $2.94 BILLION, $2.15 BILLION AND $3.31 BILLION IN 2013, 2012 AND

2011, RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTALS IN EACH YEAR REFLECTED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES, DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PROCEEDS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION

EXERCISES AND, IN 2013, PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT.

DEBT TRANSACTIONS.

2013.

ON JULY 25, 2013, THE COMPANY ISSUED $500 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.60% SENIOR NOTES THAT WILL MATURE ON

AUGUST 1, 2043. THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE ISSUANCE, AFTER ORIGINAL ISSUANCE DISCOUNT AND THE DEDUCTION OF UNDERWRITING EXPENSES AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY

$494 MILLION. INTEREST ON THE SENIOR NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 1 AND AUGUST 1, COMMENCING ON FEBRUARY 1, 2014. THE SENIOR NOTES ARE REDEEMABLE

IN WHOLE AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF (A) 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR

(B) THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED (EXCLUSIVE OF INTEREST ACCRUED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION)

DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS (ASSUMING A 360-DAY YEAR CONSISTING OF TWELVE 30-DAY MONTHS) AT THE THEN CURRENT TREASURY RATE (AS DEFINED) PLUS 15 BASIS POINTS.

IN

2014, NO DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OTHER THAN COMMERCIAL PAPER, BECOME DUE. IN 2015, THE AMOUNT OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OTHER THAN COMMERCIAL PAPER, THAT COMES DUE IS $400 MILLION. THE

COMPANY MAY REFINANCE MATURING DEBT THROUGH FUNDS GENERATED INTERNALLY OR, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, THROUGH FUNDS GENERATED EXTERNALLY, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT OR OTHER

SECURITIES.

DIVIDENDS.

DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS WERE $729 MILLION, $694 MILLION AND $665 MILLION IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS TO HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, EARNINGS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEEMS

RELEVANT. DIVIDENDS WILL BE PAID BY THE COMPANY ONLY IF DECLARED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OUT OF FUNDS LEGALLY AVAILABLE, SUBJECT TO ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY. ON

JANUARY 21, 2014, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT DECLARED A REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.50 PER SHARE, PAYABLE MARCH 31, 2014, TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON MARCH 10, 2014.

THE

AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS, NET OF TAXES. NET UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY BOTH INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, IN THE

OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, THE DEBT-TO-TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO CALCULATED ON THIS BASIS PROVIDES ANOTHER USEFUL METRIC FOR INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL LEVERAGE POSITION. THE

COMPANY'S RATIO OF DEBT-TO-TOTAL CAPITAL (EXCLUDING AFTER-TAX NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS) WAS 21.3% AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, WITHIN THE COMPANY'S TARGET RANGE OF 15% TO 25%.

CREDIT AGREEMENT.

ON JUNE 7, 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FIVE-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A

SYNDICATE OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, REPLACING ITS THREE-YEAR $1.0 BILLION CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT WAS DUE TO EXPIRE ON JUNE 10, 2013. TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN

NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SHELF REGISTRATION.

THE COMPANY HAS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE

POTENTIAL

OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES. THE COMPANY MAY OFFER THESE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF OFFERING.

SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE COMPANY HAD $4.76 BILLION OF CAPACITY REMAINING UNDER ITS SHARE

AUTHORIZATION APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND

ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM-RELATED PAYMENTS. THE

TABLE EXCLUDES SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS AND INCLUDES ONLY LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED IN CASH.

THE

TABLE BELOW INCLUDES THE AMOUNT AND ESTIMATED FUTURE TIMING OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM-RELATED PAYMENTS. THE AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE EXACT LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT ESTIMATES,

GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST BASED ON

THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY, FREQUENCY, LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS.

VARIABLES IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION OR DEFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND

LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. MANY OF THESE ITEMS ARE NOT DIRECTLY QUANTIFIABLE, PARTICULARLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE

POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND THE TIME IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER. THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE TABLE BELOW

COMPANY'S $107 MILLION REMAINING AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.25% FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE DEBENTURES BEAR INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 6.25%

FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE TO, BUT EXCLUDING, MARCH 15, 2017 AND AT A RATE OF THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 2.215% THEREAFTER. THE TABLE ABOVE INCLUDES INTEREST PAYMENTS THROUGH THE SCHEDULED MATURITY

DATE OF MARCH 15, 2037. INTEREST PAYMENTS BEGINNING MARCH 15, 2017 THROUGH MARCH 15, 2037 WERE CALCULATED USING THE THREE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.

SEE

NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS. BECAUSE THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FOREGOING TABLE INCLUDE

THE

COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS TO PROTECT ITSELF FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT IT IS PREPARED TO ACCEPT AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN

ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING, A REINSURANCE AGREEMENT MUST INDEMNIFY THE INSURER FROM INSURANCE RISK, I.E., THE AGREEMENT MUST TRANSFER AMOUNT AND TIMING RISK. SINCE THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH INFLOWS FROM SUCH REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES BY THE INSURER, REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE LIABILITIES (THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES) RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING REINSURED CONTRACTS. THE PRESENCE OF ANY FEATURE

THAT CAN DELAY TIMELY REIMBURSEMENT OF CLAIMS BY A REINSURER RESULTS IN THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DEPOSIT RATHER THAN REINSURANCE. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT

AND TIMING OF THE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE USED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE RELATED LIABILITIES.

WORKERS'

COMPENSATION LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES PROVIDE THIRD PARTY COVERAGE IN WHICH THE COMPANY TYPICALLY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE ENTIRE LOSS UNDER

SUCH POLICIES AND THEN SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE INSURED FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. "CLAIMS FROM LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES" REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENT FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED

EXPENSES BELOW THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, NET OF THE ESTIMATED RECOVERY OF THE DEDUCTIBLE. THE LIABILITY AND THE RELATED DEDUCTIBLE RECEIVABLE FOR UNPAID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AS "CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES" AND "CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES," RESPECTIVELY. MOST DEDUCTIBLES FOR SUCH POLICIES ARE PAID DIRECTLY FROM THE POLICYHOLDER'S ESCROW WHICH IS PERIODICALLY REPLENISHED

POLICYHOLDER.

THE PAYMENT OF THE LOSS AMOUNTS ABOVE THE DEDUCTIBLE ARE REPORTED WITHIN "CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES" IN THE ABOVE TABLE. BECAUSE THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF THE DEDUCTIBLE

THE

AMOUNTS IN "LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS" RELATE TO ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS OF SECOND-INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM PAYMENT OF CURRENT

CLAIM LIABILITIES. SECOND INJURY FUNDS COVER THE COST OF ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. FOR LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS, THE COST IS SHARED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

AND SELF-INSUREDS, FUNDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SELF-INSUREDS BASED ON LOSSES. AMOUNTS RELATING TO SECOND-INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN "OTHER LIABILITIES" IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

(9)

THE

AMOUNTS IN "PAYOUT FROM CEDED FUNDS WITHHELD" REPRESENT ESTIMATED PAYMENTS FOR LOSSES AND RETURN OF FUNDS HELD RELATED TO CERTAIN REINSURANCE

ARRANGEMENTS WHEREBY THE COMPANY HOLDS A PORTION OF THE PREMIUM DUE TO THE REINSURER AND IS ALLOWED TO PAY CLAIMS FROM THE AMOUNTS HELD.

(10)

THE

COMPANY'S CURRENT LIABILITIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ARE $381 MILLION. OFFSETTING THESE LIABILITIES

ARE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $362 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES THAT WOULD EXIST IF THESE POSITIONS BECOME REALIZED.

THE

ABOVE TABLE DOES NOT INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF LIABILITIES REPORTED FOR STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT

OF DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY ISSUING THE ANNUITY. THE COMPANY IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO INCUR MATERIAL FUTURE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY

SUBJECT TO ANY MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR ITS QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. ACCORDINGLY, FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FOREGOING TABLE.

DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT. THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF

CONNECTICUT APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRES NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND THAT, TOGETHER WITH OTHER

DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURER'S CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURER'S NET INCOME FOR THE

TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND BY STATE REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER

LIMITED BY ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE

DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE RESTRICTIVE, LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. A MAXIMUM OF $3.33 BILLION IS AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2014

FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS TO THE HOLDING COMPANY, TRV, WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE TO ACCELERATE THE TIMING WITHIN 2014 AND/OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT

OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2014, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CERTAIN DIVIDENDS BEING SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.

133

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRV IS NOT DEPENDENT ON DIVIDENDS OR OTHER FORMS OF REPATRIATION FROM ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF THE

COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE NOT MATERIAL AND ARE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE OPERATIONS.

TRV

AND ITS TWO NON-INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES RECEIVED $2.90 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS IN 2013, ALL OF WHICH WAS RECEIVED FROM THEIR U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY SPONSORS A QUALIFIED NON-CONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN (THE QUALIFIED PLAN), WHICH COVERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

U.S. DOMESTIC EMPLOYEES AND PROVIDES BENEFITS PRIMARILY UNDER A CASH BALANCE FORMULA. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SPONSORS: A NONQUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WHICH COVERS CERTAIN

HIGHLY-COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES, PENSION PLANS FOR EMPLOYEES OF ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AND A POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES SATISFYING CERTAIN AGE AND SERVICE

REQUIREMENTS AND FOR CERTAIN RETIREES.

THE

QUALIFIED PLAN IS SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME ACT OF 1974 AS AMENDED (ERISA), WHICH REQUIRES PLANS TO MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS OF FUNDING AND REQUIRES

SUCH PLANS TO SUBSCRIBE TO PLAN TERMINATION INSURANCE THROUGH THE PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION (PBGC). THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENT FOR THE QUALIFIED PLAN FOR 2014

AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE HAVING A MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENT IN 2015. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION IN MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THOSE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

IN 2013, THERE WAS NO MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENT FOR THE QUALIFIED PLAN, AND THE COMPANY MADE NO VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUALIFIED PLAN. IN 2012 AND 2011, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY MADE

CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $217 MILLION AND $185 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE QUALIFIED PLAN. IN DETERMINING FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS, THE COMPANY WILL CONSIDER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PLAN'S

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATES ON THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE PLAN AND THE COMPANY'S OTHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT

ADDITIONAL VOLUNTARY FUNDING WILL BE MADE IN THE 2014. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES, SUBJECT TO ACTUAL PLAN PERFORMANCE AND FUNDED STATUS AT THE TIME, THAT IT MAY MAKE VOLUNTARY PENSION

CONTRIBUTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION TO $100 MILLION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN 2015 AS WELL AS OVER THE FOLLOWING SEVERAL YEARS.

THE

QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS ARE MANAGED TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM TOTAL RETURN. THE COMPANY'S OVERALL STRATEGY IS TO ACHIEVE A MIX OF APPROXIMATELY 85% TO 90% OF INVESTMENTS FOR LONG-TERM

GROWTH AND 10% TO 15% FOR NEAR-TERM BENEFIT PAYMENTS WITH A WIDE DIVERSIFICATION OF ASSET TYPES, FUND STRATEGIES AND FUND MANAGERS. THE CURRENT TARGET ALLOCATIONS FOR PLAN ASSETS ARE 55% TO 65% EQUITY

SECURITIES AND 20% TO 40% FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER ALLOCATED TO SHORT-TERM SECURITIES. FOR 2014, THE COMPANY PLANS TO APPLY AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OF

7.50%, THE SAME RATE AS IN 2013. THE RATES OF RETURN REFLECT THE COMPANY'S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OF LONG-TERM RETURNS ON THE PLAN'S INVESTED ASSETS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CURRENT LOW LEVEL OF

LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S COMMENTARY IN NOVEMBER 2013 REGARDING ITS EXPECTATION TO MAINTAIN INTEREST RATES AT THEIR CURRENT LOW LEVELS UNTIL THE NATIONAL LABOR MARKET

IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG. THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ALSO CONTEMPLATES A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS OF LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES IN THE FUTURE.

FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, SEE NOTE 14 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

THE NAIC HAS RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC) REQUIREMENTS FOR PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES TO BE USED AS MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THE

NAIC AND STATES TO IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MERIT FURTHER REGULATORY ACTION. THE FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE AMONG ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH LEVELS OF

CAPITAL ABOVE THE RBC REQUIREMENTS. THEREFORE, IT IS

134

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INAPPROPRIATE

AND INEFFECTIVE TO USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, ALL OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS

REQUIRING ANY COMPANY OR REGULATORY ACTION.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO CERTAIN CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS FOR GUARANTEES RELATED TO THE SALE OF BUSINESS ENTITIES, CERTAIN

INVESTMENTS, THIRD-PARTY LOANS RELATED TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN INSURANCE POLICY OBLIGATIONS OF FORMER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND VARIOUS OTHER INDEMNIFICATIONS. SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO

THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE ARRANGEMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL POSITION, REVENUES

AND EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES TO BE THOSE APPLIED TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND

RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, INVESTMENT VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENTS, AND GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IMPAIRMENTS.

GROSS

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 DECREASED BY $27 MILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2012, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, PAYMENTS RELATED TO CATASTROPHES AND PAYMENTS RELATED TO OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF, INCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF

THE ACQUISITION OF DOMINION. DOMINION'S RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WERE INCLUDED IN THE "INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER" CATEGORY IN THE FOREGOING TABLE.

ASBESTOS

AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER LINES IN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY TABLE. ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE DISCUSSED SEPARATELY; SEE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION", "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES."

135

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS

THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED (IBNR). CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES,

GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST

UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND

FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING GROSS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, THE COMPANY ALSO CONSIDERS SALVAGE AND

SUBROGATION. ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE ARE INCLUDED IN "REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES" AS AN ASSET ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, CHANGES IN INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE

CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY

PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME

BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL

EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS

ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. THE COMPANY RIGOROUSLY ATTEMPTS TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE

INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT ENVIRONMENT, FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES, AS CLAIMS ARE SETTLED IN THE FUTURE, MAY BE MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNT CURRENTLY RECORDEDFAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE.

BECAUSE

ESTABLISHMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES, CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES MAY

CHANGE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED.

THERE

ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES, TORNADOES AND OTHER

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND

REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE INTERPRETATION OF POLICY TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF DEMAND

SURGE, INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION, FRAUD, THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A

REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

136

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A

PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S GROSS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (TOTALING $2.96 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013) ARE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

RELATED LITIGATION. WHILE THE ONGOING REVIEW OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES

REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. SEE THE PRECEDING

DISCUSSION OF "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION."

GENERAL DISCUSSION

THE PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING THE LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES BEGINS WITH THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CLAIM

DATA. DATA ON INDIVIDUAL REPORTED CLAIMS, BOTH CURRENT AND HISTORICAL, INCLUDING PAID AMOUNTS AND INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES, ARE GROUPED BY COMMON CHARACTERISTICS (COMPONENTS) AND EVALUATED

BY ACTUARIES IN THEIR ANALYSES OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES BY PRODUCT LINE. SUCH DATA IS OCCASIONALLY SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA AS AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING

RESERVES FOR A COMPONENT IS UNDERTAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS, GENERALLY QUARTERLY, IN LIGHT OF CONTINUALLY UPDATED INFORMATION.

MULTIPLE

ESTIMATION METHODS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES. EACH ESTIMATION METHOD HAS ITS OWN SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES AND ITS OWN ADVANTAGES AND

DISADVANTAGES, WITH NO SINGLE ESTIMATION METHOD BEING BETTER THAN THE OTHERS IN ALL SITUATIONS AND NO ONE SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES BEING MEANINGFUL FOR ALL PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS. THE RELATIVE

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE PARTICULAR ESTIMATION METHODS WHEN APPLIED TO A PARTICULAR GROUP OF CLAIMS CAN ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME. THEREFORE, THE ACTUAL CHOICE OF ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CAN CHANGE

WITH EACH EVALUATION. THE ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CHOSEN ARE THOSE THAT ARE BELIEVED TO PRODUCE THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATION AT THAT PARTICULAR EVALUATION DATE FOR THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED.

IN

MOST CASES, MULTIPLE ESTIMATION METHODS WILL BE VALID FOR THE PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED. THIS WILL RESULT IN A RANGE OF REASONABLE

ESTIMATES FOR ANY PARTICULAR CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY USES SUCH RANGE ANALYSES TO BACK TEST WHETHER PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES FOR RESERVES AT THE REPORTING SEGMENTS ARE REASONABLE, GIVEN

SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION. REPORTED VALUES FOUND TO BE CLOSER TO THE ENDPOINTS OF A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER DETAILED REVIEWS. THESE REVIEWS MAY SUBSTANTIATE THE VALIDITY OF

MANAGEMENT'S RECORDED ESTIMATE OR LEAD TO A CHANGE IN THE REPORTED ESTIMATE.

THE

EXACT BOUNDARY POINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN QUANTITATIVE IN NATURE, AS NO CLEAR LINE OF DEMARCATION EXISTS TO DETERMINE WHEN THE SET OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR

AN ESTIMATION METHOD SWITCHES FROM BEING REASONABLE TO UNREASONABLE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ENDPOINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE OR WOULD BE COMPARABLE ACROSS COMPANIES. IN

ADDITION, POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT ESTIMATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES MAKE THE AGGREGATION OF INDIVIDUAL RANGES A HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL AND INEXACT PROCESS.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

INSURANCE POLICIES ARE EITHER WRITTEN ON A CLAIMS-MADE OR ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. CLAIMS-MADE POLICIES GENERALLY COVER, SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL POLICIES,

CLAIMS REPORTED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD. POLICIES THAT ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS REQUIRE THAT THE INSURED DEMONSTRATE THAT A LOSS OCCURRED IN THE POLICY PERIOD, EVEN IF THE INSURED REPORTS

THE LOSS MANY YEARS LATER.

MOST

GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. THESE POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT OVER TIME AS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE IN THE YEARS

FOLLOWING THE POLICY ISSUANCE. THE OCCURRENCE FORM, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, IS ALSO USED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION

GENERAL LIABILITY,

137

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCLUDING

CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. OCCURRENCE-BASED FORMS OF INSURANCE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PROJECTION OF VARIOUS TRENDS, INCLUDING FUTURE INFLATION, JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS AND

SOCIETAL LITIGATION TRENDS (E.G., SIZE OF JURY AWARDS AND PROPENSITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO PURSUE LITIGATION), AMONG OTHERS.

A

BASIC PREMISE IN MOST ACTUARIAL ANALYSES IS THAT PAST PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED IN THE DATA WILL REPEAT THEMSELVES IN THE FUTURE, ABSENT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS

DISCUSSED BELOW. TO THE EXTENT A MATERIAL CHANGE AFFECTING THE ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY IS KNOWN, SUCH CHANGE IS QUANTIFIED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL COMPANY DATA AND, IF

AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXTERNAL DATA. SUCH A MEASUREMENT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR CLAIM PORTFOLIO AND THE KNOWN CHANGE BEING EVALUATED. SIGNIFICANT

STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS.

INFORMED

JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE RESERVING PROCESS. THIS INCLUDES THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. IN

ADDITION TO ACTUARIES, EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE RESERVING PROCESS ALSO INCLUDE UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO

CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES. IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE, SUCH AS A MERGER,

CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF INFORMED JUDGMENT BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT.

THE

VARIABLES DISCUSSED ABOVE IN THIS GENERAL DISCUSSION HAVE DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON RESERVE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE CLAIM TAIL, THE

REPORTING LAG, THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CLAIM PROCESS FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE.

PRODUCT

LINES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIABLE AS EITHER LONG TAIL OR SHORT TAIL, BASED ON THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING CLAIMS UNDER A POLICY AND THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THOSE CLAIMS. SHORT TAIL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED QUICKLY, RESULTING IN LESS ESTIMATION VARIABILITY. THE LONGER THE TIME BEFORE FINAL CLAIM RESOLUTION, THE GREATER THE EXPOSURE TO

ESTIMATION RISKS AND HENCE THE GREATER THE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

A

MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE CLAIM TAIL IS THE REPORTING LAG. THE REPORTING LAG, WHICH IS THE TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING A CLAIM AND THE REPORTING OF THE CLAIM TO THE INSURER, MAKES

ESTIMATING IBNR INHERENTLY MORE UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, THE GREATER THE REPORTING LAG, THE GREATER THE PROPORTION OF IBNR TO THE TOTAL CLAIM LIABILITY FOR THE PRODUCT LINE. WRITING NEW PRODUCTS WITH

MATERIAL REPORTING LAGS CAN RESULT IN ADDING SEVERAL YEARS' WORTH OF IBNR CLAIM EXPOSURE BEFORE THE REPORTING LAG EXPOSURE BECOMES CLEARLY OBSERVABLE, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

PRICING AND RESERVING SUCH PRODUCTS. THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF CLAIM LIABILITIES WITH LONG REPORTING LAGS ARE ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

FOR

SOME LINES, THE IMPACT OF LARGE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS CAN BE MATERIAL TO THE ANALYSIS. THESE LINES ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS BEING "LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY," WHILE LINES WITHOUT

THIS "LARGE CLAIM" SENSITIVITY ARE REFERRED TO AS "HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY." ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY LINES CAN BE SENSITIVE TO THE IMPACT OF A SMALL NUMBER

OF POTENTIALLY LARGE CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE ROLE OF JUDGMENT IS MUCH GREATER FOR THESE RESERVE ESTIMATES. IN CONTRAST, FOR

HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY LINES THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS IS RELATIVELY MINOR AND THE RANGE OF REASONABLE RESERVE ESTIMATES IS NARROWER AND MORE STABLE.

CLAIM

COMPLEXITY CAN ALSO GREATLY AFFECT THE ESTIMATION PROCESS BY IMPACTING THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ESTIMATE, THE POTENTIAL STABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING DATA AND

CLAIM PROCESS, AND THE ABILITY TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA. PRODUCT LINES WITH GREATER CLAIM COMPLEXITY, SUCH AS FOR CERTAIN SURETY AND CONSTRUCTION EXPOSURES, HAVE INHERENTLY GREATER

ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

ACTUARIES

HAVE TO EXERCISE A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT IN THE EVALUATION OF ALL THESE FACTORS IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF RESERVES. THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN THE APPLICATION OF ACTUARIAL

JUDGMENT IS UNAVOIDABLE

138

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHEN

FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY. DIFFERENT ACTUARIES MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH SUCH UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND AREAS

OF FOCUS. HENCE, THE ESTIMATES SELECTED BY THE VARIOUS ACTUARIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EACH OTHER.

LASTLY,

SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN ALSO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS. EVENTS SUCH AS MERGERS INCREASE THE

INHERENT UNCERTAINTY OF RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, UNTIL STABLE TRENDS RE-ESTABLISH THEMSELVES WITHIN THE NEW ORGANIZATION.

RISK FACTORS

THE MAJOR CAUSES OF MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY ("RISK FACTORS") GENERALLY WILL VARY FOR EACH PRODUCT LINE, AS WELL AS FOR EACH SEPARATELY

ANALYZED COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT LINE. IN A FEW CASES, SUCH RISK FACTORS ARE EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ESTIMATION METHOD, BUT IN MOST CASES, THEY ARE IMPLICIT. FOR EXAMPLE, A METHOD MAY EXPLICITLY

ASSUME THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS WILL CLOSE EACH YEAR, BUT WILL IMPLICITLY ASSUME THAT THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING CONTRACT LANGUAGE WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED. ACTUAL RESULTS WILL

LIKELY VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS, CAUSING ACTUAL PAID LOSSES, AS CLAIMS ARE SETTLED IN THE FUTURE, TO BE DIFFERENT IN AMOUNT THAN THE RESERVES BEING ESTIMATED CURRENTLY.

SOME

RISK FACTORS WILL AFFECT MORE THAN ONE PRODUCT LINE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CHANGES IN CLAIM DEPARTMENT PRACTICES, CHANGES IN SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS,

COURT ACTIONS, TIMELINESS OF CLAIM REPORTING, STATE MIX OF CLAIMANTS AND DEGREE OF CLAIMANT FRAUD. THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF A RISK FACTOR WILL ALSO VARY BY COMPONENTS WITHIN A PRODUCT LINE.

INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER RISK FACTORS WITHIN PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS.

THE

EFFECT OF A PARTICULAR RISK FACTOR ON ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES CANNOT BE ISOLATED IN MOST CASES. FOR EXAMPLE, ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL CLAIM SETTLEMENTS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL COURT RULINGS, BUT THE FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TYPICALLY DOES NOT DELINEATE HOW MUCH OF THE SETTLED AMOUNT IS DUE TO THIS AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE

EVALUATION OF DATA IS ALSO SUBJECT TO DISTORTION FROM EXTREME EVENTS OR STRUCTURAL SHIFTS, SOMETIMES IN UNANTICIPATED WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TIMING OF CLAIMS PAYMENTS IN ONE

GEOGRAPHIC REGION WILL BE IMPACTED IF CLAIM ADJUSTERS ARE TEMPORARILY REASSIGNED FROM THAT REGION TO HELP SETTLE CATASTROPHE CLAIMS IN ANOTHER REGION.

WHILE

SOME CHANGES IN THE CLAIM ENVIRONMENT ARE SUDDEN IN NATURE (SUCH AS A NEW COURT RULING AFFECTING THE INTERPRETATION OF ALL CONTRACTS IN THAT JURISDICTION), OTHERS ARE MORE

EVOLUTIONARY. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES CAN OCCUR WHEN MULTIPLE FACTORS AFFECT FINAL CLAIM VALUES, WITH THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING EACH FACTOR BEING RESOLVED SEPARATELY, IN STEPWISE FASHION. THE FINAL

IMPACT IS NOT KNOWN UNTIL ALL STEPS HAVE OCCURRED.

SUDDEN

CHANGES GENERALLY CAUSE A ONE-TIME SHIFT IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME LAG IN RELIABLE QUANTIFICATION OF THEIR IMPACT. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES GENERALLY

CAUSE A SERIES OF SHIFTS IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, AS EACH COMPONENT OF THE EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE BECOMES EVIDENT AND ESTIMABLE.

ACTUARIAL METHODS FOR ANALYZING AND ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

THE PRINCIPAL ESTIMATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT'S EXISTING ESTIMATES FOR PRIOR

ACCIDENT PERIODS ARE THE PAID DEVELOPMENT METHOD, THE CASE INCURRED DEVELOPMENT METHOD, THE BORNHUETTER-FERGUSON (BF) METHOD, AND AVERAGE VALUE ANALYSIS COMBINED WITH THE REPORTED CLAIM DEVELOPMENT

METHOD. THE BF METHOD IS USUALLY UTILIZED FOR MORE RECENT ACCIDENT PERIODS, WITH A TRANSITION TO OTHER METHODS AS THE UNDERLYING CLAIM DATA BECOMES MORE VOLUMINOUS AND THEREFORE MORE CREDIBLE. THESE

ARE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS. (SEE GLOSSARY FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THESE METHODS).

139

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE THESE ARE THE PRINCIPAL METHODS UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY, ACTUARIES EVALUATING A PARTICULAR COMPONENT FOR A PRODUCT LINE HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM THE

FULL RANGE OF METHODS DEVELOPED WITHIN THE CASUALTY ACTUARIAL PROFESSION. THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES ARE ALSO CONTINUALLY MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE PROFESSION FOR ADVANCES IN EXISTING TECHNIQUES

OR THE CREATION OF NEW TECHNIQUES THAT MIGHT IMPROVE CURRENT AND FUTURE ESTIMATES.

SOME

COMPONENTS OF PRODUCT LINE RESERVES ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RELATIVELY INFREQUENT LARGE CLAIMS THAT CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TOTAL ESTIMATE FOR THAT COMPONENT. IN SUCH CASES, THE

COMPANY'S ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS GENERALLY ISOLATES AND ANALYZES SEPARATELY SUCH LARGE CLAIMS. THE RESERVES EXCLUDING SUCH LARGE CLAIMS ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED USING THE CONVENTIONAL METHODS DESCRIBED

ABOVE. THE RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE CLAIMS ARE THEN ANALYZED UTILIZING VARIOUS METHODS, SUCH AS.



ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF LARGE CLAIMS AND THEIR AVERAGE VALUES BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS FROM PRIOR ACCIDENT PERIODS,

ADJUSTED FOR THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH ACTUAL DATA FOR THE ACCIDENT YEAR ANALYZED TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE.



UTILIZING INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES OF THE LARGE CLAIMS, COMBINED WITH CONTINUAL MONITORING OF THE AGGREGATE

ACCURACY OF SUCH CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES. (THIS MONITORING MAY LEAD TO SUPPLEMENTAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AGGREGATE OF SUCH CLAIM ESTIMATES.)



UTILIZING HISTORIC LONGER-TERM AVERAGE RATIOS OF LARGE CLAIMS TO SMALL CLAIMS, AND APPLYING SUCH RATIOS TO THE ESTIMATED

ULTIMATE SMALL CLAIMS FROM CONVENTIONAL ANALYSIS.



GROUND-UP ANALYSIS OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE (TYPICALLY USED FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL).

THE

RESULTS OF SUCH METHODOLOGIES ARE SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS REASONABILITY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, INCLUDING PAID-TO-INCURRED LOSS RATIOS, IMPLIED INCURRED-LOSS-TO-EARNED-PREMIUM RATIOS AND

NON-ZERO CLAIM SEVERITY TRENDS. AN ACTUAL VERSUS EXPECTED ANALYSIS IS ALSO PERFORMED COMPARING ACTUAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT TO EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT EMBEDDED WITHIN MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATE. ADDITIONAL

ANALYSES MAY BE PERFORMED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE DIAGNOSTICS, INCLUDING THE INVESTIGATION OF OTHER ACTUARIAL METHODS.

THE

METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT'S EXISTING ESTIMATE FOR PRIOR ACCIDENT PERIODS. FOR THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR, THE

AVAILABLE CLAIM DATA IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE A RELIABLE INDICATION. HENCE, THE INITIAL ESTIMATE FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR IS GENERALLY BASED ON A LOSS RATIO PROJECTION METHOD, WHICH USES THE

EARNED PREMIUM FOR THE CURRENT YEAR MULTIPLIED BY A PROJECTED LOSS RATIO. THE PROJECTED LOSS RATIO IS DETERMINED THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF PRIOR PERIODS' EXPERIENCE, USING LOSS TREND, RATE LEVEL

DIFFERENCES, MIX OF BUSINESS CHANGES AND OTHER KNOWN OR OBSERVED FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR RELATIVE TO PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS. THE EXACT NUMBER OF PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS UTILIZED

VARIES BY PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT, BASED ON THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS FOR THAT COMPONENT AND THE RELIABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT YEAR ESTIMATE.

MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES

AT LEAST ONCE PER QUARTER, CERTAIN MEMBERS OF COMPANY MANAGEMENT MEET WITH THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES TO REVIEW THE LATEST CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ANALYSES. BASED ON THESE ANALYSES, MANAGEMENT DETERMINES WHETHER ITS ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CHANGED. IN DOING SO, IT MUST EVALUATE WHETHER THE

NEW DATA PROVIDED REPRESENTS CREDIBLE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION OR AN ANOMALY THAT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, PAYMENTS MAY HAVE DECREASED

IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC REGION DUE TO FEWER

CLAIM ADJUSTERS BEING AVAILABLE TO PROCESS CLAIMS. THE RESULTING CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS WOULD BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CHANGE IN PAYMENT PATTERN REPRESENTS A CHANGE IN ULTIMATE

CLAIM LIABILITY.

SUCH

AN ASSESSMENT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT. IT IS FREQUENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CHANGE IN THE DATA IS AN ANOMALY UNTIL SOMETIME AFTER THE EVENT. EVEN IF A CHANGE

IS

140

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DETERMINED

TO BE PERMANENT, IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE UNTIL SOMETIME LATER. THE OVERALL DETAILED ANALYSES SUPPORTING SUCH AN EFFORT CAN TAKE SEVERAL

MONTHS TO PERFORM. THIS IS BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE TRENDS OBSERVED NEED TO BE EVALUATED, WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE GATHERING OR ASSEMBLING OF DATA NOT PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. IT MAY ALSO

INCLUDE INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES. AS A RESULT, THERE CAN BE A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE EMERGENCE OF A CHANGE AND A DETERMINATION THAT THE CHANGE SHOULD BE REFLECTED

IN THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED CLAIM LIABILITIES. THE FINAL ESTIMATE SELECTED BY MANAGEMENT IN A REPORTING PERIOD IS BASED ON THESE VARIOUS DETAILED ANALYSES OF PAST DATA, ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ANY NEW

ACTIONABLE INFORMATION.

THE

AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF RESERVING PROPRIETY, AND ANNUALLY REVIEWS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES RESERVES.

DISCUSSION OF PRODUCT LINES

THE FOLLOWING SECTION DETAILS RESERVING CONSIDERATIONS AND COMMON RISK FACTORS BY PRODUCT LINE. THERE ARE MANY ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS

THAT MAY IMPACT ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS. EACH RISK FACTOR PRESENTED WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT ON REQUIRED RESERVES. ALSO, RISK FACTORS CAN HAVE OFFSETTING OR COMPOUNDING EFFECTS ON REQUIRED RESERVES.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN WORKERS' COMPENSATION, THE USE OF EXPENSIVE MEDICAL PROCEDURES THAT RESULT IN MEDICAL COST INFLATION MAY ENABLE WORKERS TO RETURN TO WORK FASTER, THEREBY LOWERING INDEMNITY COSTS.

THUS, IN ALMOST ALL CASES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCRETELY MEASURE THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE RISK FACTOR AND CONSTRUCT A MEANINGFUL SENSITIVITY EXPECTATION.

IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON REASONABLY POSSIBLE RESERVING CHANGES BY PRODUCT LINE, THE HISTORICAL CHANGES IN YEAR-END CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES OVER A ONE-YEAR

PERIOD ARE PROVIDED FOR THE U.S. PRODUCT LINES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR BOTH THE COMPANY AND THE INDUSTRY FOR THE NINE MOST RECENT YEARS, AND IS BASED ON THE MOST RECENT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

DATA FOR THE REPORTED LINE(S) THAT MOST CLOSELY MATCH THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT LINE BEING DISCUSSED. THESE CHANGES WERE CALCULATED, NET

OF REINSURANCE, FROM STATUTORY ANNUAL STATEMENT DATA FOUND IN SCHEDULE P OF THOSE STATEMENTS, AND REPRESENT THE REPORTED RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON THE BEGINNING-OF-THE-YEAR CLAIM LIABILITIES

DIVIDED BY THE BEGINNING CLAIM LIABILITIES, ALL ACCIDENT YEARS COMBINED, EXCLUDING NON-DEFENSE RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE. DATA PRESENTED FOR THE COMPANY INCLUDES HISTORY FOR THE ENTIRE

TRAVELERS GROUP (U.S. COMPANIES ONLY), WHETHER OR NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIARIES WERE ORIGINALLY PART OF SPC OR TPC. THIS TREATMENT IS REQUIRED BY THE STATUTORY REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS PROMULGATED BY

STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES FOR SCHEDULE P. COMPARABLE DATA FOR NON-U.S. COMPANIES IS NOT AVAILABLE.

GENERAL LIABILITY

GENERAL LIABILITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL LINE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS

FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION AND SPECIFIC POLICY PROVISIONS SUCH AS SELF-INSURED

RETENTIONS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPONENTS UNDERLYING THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. SOME OF THESE HAVE RELATIVELY MODERATE PAYMENT PATTERNS (WITH MOST OF THE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR

CLOSED WITHIN FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS), WHILE OTHERS CAN HAVE EXTREME LAGS IN BOTH REPORTING AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS (E.G., A REPORTING LAG OF A DECADE OR MORE FOR "CONSTRUCTION DEFECT" CLAIMS).

WHILE

THE MAJORITY OF GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES ARE WRITTEN ON AN "OCCURRENCE" BASIS, CERTAIN GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES (SUCH AS THOSE COVERING DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OR PROFESSIONAL

LIABILITY) ARE TYPICALLY INSURED ON A "CLAIMS-MADE" BASIS.

GENERAL

LIABILITY RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED AS TWO COMPONENTS: PRIMARY AND EXCESS/UMBRELLA, WITH THE PRIMARY COMPONENT GENERALLY ANALYZED SEPARATELY FOR BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY

DAMAGE. BODILY INJURY LIABILITY PAYMENTS REIMBURSE THE CLAIMANT FOR DAMAGES PERTAINING TO PHYSICAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S LEGAL OBLIGATION ARISING FROM NON-INTENTIONAL ACTS SUCH AS

NEGLIGENCE, SUBJECT TO THE INSURANCE POLICY PROVISIONS. IN SOME CASES THE DAMAGES CAN INCLUDE FUTURE WAGE LOSS (WHICH IS A

141

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FUNCTION

OF FUTURE EARNINGS POWER AND WAGE INFLATION) AND FUTURE MEDICAL TREATMENT COSTS. PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY PAYMENTS RESULT FROM DAMAGES TO THE CLAIMANT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY ARISING FROM THE

POLICYHOLDER'S LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR NON-INTENTIONAL ACTS. IN MOST CASES, PROPERTY DAMAGE LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF COSTS AS OF THE LOSS DATE, OR SOON THEREAFTER.

IN

ADDITION, SIZABLE OR UNIQUE EXPOSURES ARE REVIEWED SEPARATELY. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE ASBESTOS, ENVIRONMENTAL, OTHER MASS TORTS, CONSTRUCTION DEFECT AND LARGE UNIQUE ACCOUNTS THAT

WOULD OTHERWISE DISTORT THE ANALYSIS. THESE UNIQUE CATEGORIES OFTEN REQUIRE A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND REQUIRE RESERVE ANALYSES THAT DO NOT RELY ON CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS.

DEFENSE

COSTS ARE ALSO A PART OF THE INSURED COSTS COVERED BY LIABILITY POLICIES AND CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, SOMETIMES GREATER THAN THE COST OF THE ACTUAL PAID CLAIMS. FOR SOME PRODUCTS THIS

RISK IS MITIGATED BY POLICY LANGUAGE SUCH THAT THE INSURED PORTION OF DEFENSE COSTS ERODES THE AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT AVAILABLE TO PAY THE CLAIM. SUCH "DEFENSE WITHIN THE LIMITS" POLICIES ARE MOST

COMMON FOR "CLAIMS-MADE" PRODUCTS. WHEN DEFENSE COSTS ARE OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITS, AMOUNTS PAID FOR DEFENSE COSTS DO NOT ERODE THE POLICY LIMITS.

THIS

LINE IS TYPICALLY THE LARGEST SOURCE OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY IN THE UNITED STATES (EXCLUDING ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS COVERING THE SAME RISK). MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO

THIS RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY INCLUDE THE REPORTING LAG (I.E., THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING COVERAGE AND THE ACTUAL REPORTING OF THE CLAIM), THE NUMBER OF PARTIES

INVOLVED IN THE UNDERLYING TORT ACTION, WHETHER THE "EVENT" TRIGGERING COVERAGE IS CONFINED TO ONLY ONE TIME PERIOD OR IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE TIME PERIODS, THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED (IN THE

INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ACTIONS), WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND INTENDED TO BE COVERED AT THE TIME THE CONTRACTS WERE WRITTEN (I.E., COVERAGE DISPUTE POTENTIAL), AND THE

POTENTIAL FOR MASS CLAIM ACTIONS. CLAIMS WITH LONGER REPORTING LAGS RESULT IN GREATER INHERENT RISK. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR ALLEGED CLAIMS WITH A LATENCY FEATURE, PARTICULARLY WHERE COURTS HAVE

RULED THAT COVERAGE IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE POLICY YEARS, HENCE INVOLVING MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS (AND THEIR INSURERS AND REINSURERS) AND MULTIPLE POLICIES (THEREBY INCREASING THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS

INVOLVED AND THE UNDERLYING SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY). CLAIMS WITH LONG LATENCIES ALSO INCREASE THE POTENTIAL RECOGNITION LAG (I.E., THE LAG BETWEEN WRITING A TYPE OF POLICY IN A CERTAIN MARKET

AND THE RECOGNITION THAT SUCH POLICIES HAVE POTENTIAL MASS TORT AND/OR LATENT CLAIM EXPOSURE).

THE

AMOUNT OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY ALSO VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY BY COMPONENT FOR THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. THE COMPONENTS IN THIS PRODUCT LINE WITH THE LONGEST LATENCY,

LONGEST REPORTING LAGS, LARGEST POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED AND GREATEST CLAIM SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY ARE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL. COMPONENTS THAT INCLUDE LATENCY, REPORTING LAG AND/OR COMPLEXITY

ISSUES, BUT TO A MATERIALLY LESSER EXTENT THAN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT AND OTHER MASS TORT ACTIONS. MANY COMPONENTS OF GENERAL LIABILITY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO MATERIAL

LATENCY OR CLAIM COMPLEXITY RISKS AND HENCE HAVE MATERIALLY LESS UNCERTAINTY THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED COMPONENTS. IN GENERAL, POLICIES PROVIDING COVERAGE WITH SHORTER REPORTING LAGS, FEWER

PARTIES INVOLVED IN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS, ONLY ONE POLICY POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED PER CLAIM, FEWER POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOLLARS, REASONABLY FORESEEABLE (AND STABLE) POTENTIAL HAZARDS/CLAIMS AND NO

MASS TORT POTENTIAL RESULT IN MUCH LESS RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY THAN POLICIES WITHOUT THOSE CHARACTERISTICS.

IN

ADDITION TO THE CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS MENTIONED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION, THE COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS REPORT YEAR DEVELOPMENT AND S-CURVE METHODS FOR THE

CONSTRUCTION DEFECT COMPONENTS OF THIS PRODUCT LINE. THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT REPORT YEAR DEVELOPMENT ANALYSIS IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH PROJECTED CLAIM COUNTS AND AVERAGE VALUES FOR IBNR CLAIM COUNTS. FOR

COMPONENTS WITH GREATER LAGS IN CLAIM REPORTING, SUCH AS EXCESS AND UMBRELLA COMPONENTS OF THIS PRODUCT LINE, THE COMPANY RELIES MORE HEAVILY ON THE BF METHOD THAN ON THE PAID AND CASE INCURRED

DEVELOPMENT METHODS.

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR GENERAL LIABILITY

(EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL), A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.5% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AMOUNTS, OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM

-8% TO 4% (AVERAGING -3%) FOR THE COMPANY AND FROM -5% TO 5% (AVERAGING -2%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY,

AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS

PRODUCT LINE. GENERAL LIABILITY RESERVES (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL) REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 22% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AMOUNTS, WAS -4% FOR 2013, -3% FOR 2012 AND

-8% FOR 2011. THE 2013 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN ACCIDENT YEARS 2010 AND PRIOR AND REFLECTED WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE MORE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS THAN

WHAT THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. THE 2012 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN EXCESS COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2009 AND PRIOR AND REFLECTED WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE MORE FAVORABLE LEGAL

AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS THAN WHAT THE COMPANY

143

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PREVIOUSLY

EXPECTED. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE 2012 CHANGE WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS FOR MANAGEMENT LIABILITY BUSINESS, PRIMARILY FOR THE ERRORS & OMISSIONS AND FIDUCIARY PRODUCTS FOR

ACCIDENT YEARS 2007 AND PRIOR. THE 2011 CHANGE WAS CONCENTRATED IN EXCESS COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2005-2008 AND REFLECTED WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE MORE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL

ENVIRONMENTS THAN WHAT THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED.

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL LINE WITH A SIMPLER AND FASTER CLAIM REPORTING AND ADJUSTMENT PROCESS THAN

LIABILITY COVERAGES, AND LESS UNCERTAINTY IN THE RESERVE SETTING PROCESS (EXCEPT FOR MORE COMPLEX BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS). IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A MODERATE FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE

SEVERITY LINE, EXCEPT FOR CATASTROPHES AND COVERAGE RELATED TO LARGE PROPERTIES. THE CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE CLAIM RESERVES IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED

AND THE INSURER. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A LOW ESTIMATION RISK, EXCEPT POSSIBLY FOR CATASTROPHES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS.

COMMERCIAL

PROPERTY RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN TWO COMPONENTS, ONE FOR CATASTROPHIC OR OTHER LARGE SINGLE EVENTS, AND ANOTHER FOR ALL OTHER EVENTS. EXAMPLES OF COMMON RISK

FACTORS, OR PERCEPTIONS THEREOF, THAT COULD CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED PROPERTY RESERVES (BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION) INCLUDE.

UNANTICIPATED

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR PROPERTY, A 1%

INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -34% TO -5% (AVERAGING -18%)

FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM -14% TO -5% (AVERAGING -10%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS

DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES

144

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IS

ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL PROPERTY RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

SINCE

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE, THE ONE YEAR CHANGE FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CAN BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THAT FOR THE LONGER TAIL PRODUCT LINES. THIS IS DUE

TO THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVE FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY RELATES TO THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE MOST UNCERTAINTY FOR ALL PRODUCT LINES. THIS RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR

UNCERTAINTY IS RELEVANT TO COMMERCIAL PROPERTY BECAUSE OF WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS WHICH, NOTWITHSTANDING 2010 AND 2011 EXPERIENCE, TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, AND GENERALLY

ARE NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. RESERVE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CATASTROPHES MAY TAKE EVEN LONGER TO RESOLVE. THE RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE ARE ALSO

POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO MATERIAL CHANGES DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN MEASURING ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, HURRICANE KATRINA AND STORM SANDY.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -17% FOR 2013, -22% FOR 2012 AND -5% FOR 2011. THE 2013 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED

BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2010 THROUGH 2012, DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO BOTH CATASTROPHE AND NON-CATASTROPHE LOSSES. THE 2012 CHANGE PRIMARILY

REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2009 THROUGH 2011, DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES INCURRED IN 2011, AND BY HIGHER SUBROGATION AND

SALVAGE RECOVERIES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2009 THROUGH 2011. THE 2011 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT IN THE 2008 AND 2009 ACCIDENT YEARS FOR CERTAIN LARGE NATIONAL PROPERTY

AND OCEAN MARINE EXPOSURES.

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND, THEREFORE,

INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE, IT GENERALLY TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS, WHILE FOR THE OTHER COVERAGES, GENERALLY FOR THE LIABILITY

COVERAGES, IT TAKES A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS.

THE

RESERVING RISK FOR THIS LINE IS DOMINATED BY THE LIABILITY COVERAGE PORTION OF THIS PRODUCT, EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY IN THE EVENT OF CATASTROPHIC OR LARGE SINGLE LOSSES. THE RESERVING

RISK FOR THIS LINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE AND THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CUSTOMER. COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL IS GENERALLY SOLD TO SMALLER-SIZED

ACCOUNTS, WHILE THE CUSTOMER PROFILE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY INCLUDES LARGER CUSTOMERS.

SEE

"COMMERCIAL PROPERTY RISK FACTORS" AND "GENERAL LIABILITY RISK FACTORS," DISCUSSED ABOVE, WITH REGARD TO RESERVING RISK FOR COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL.

UNANTICIPATED

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL), A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.2% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -19% TO 5% (AVERAGING -5%) FOR THE

COMPANY, AND FROM -6% TO 2% (AVERAGING -3%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL RESERVES (EXCLUDING

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES) REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

145

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THIS LINE COMBINES GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY COVERAGES AND IT HAS BEEN IMPACTED IN THE PAST BY MANY OF THE SAME EVENTS AS THOSE TWO LINES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 2% FOR 2013, -1% FOR 2012 AND 5% FOR 2011. THE 2013 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED UNFAVORABLE LOSS EXPERIENCE

FOR THE LIABILITY COVERAGE FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2008 THROUGH 2011, DRIVEN BY HIGHER THAN EXPECTED SEVERITY AND DEFENSE COSTS. THE 2011 CHANGE REFLECTED UNFAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT DRIVEN BY LATE

REPORTING OF HAIL CLAIMS INCURRED IN 2010.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE IS A MIX OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGES AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL

COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE

DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. IN GENERAL, CLAIM REPORTING LAGS ARE MINOR, CLAIM COMPLEXITY IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE, AND THE LINE IS VIEWED AS HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE

SEVERITY. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

COMMERCIAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN FOUR COMPONENTS: BODILY INJURY LIABILITY; PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY; COLLISION CLAIMS; AND COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS. THESE LAST TWO

COMPONENTS HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT PRESENTED.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES THE CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS MENTIONED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOVE IN ESTIMATING CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE. THIS IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH DETAILED CUSTOM

ANALYSES WHERE NEEDED.

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR COMMERCIAL

AUTOMOBILE, A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.2% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -10% TO 7% (AVERAGING -3%) FOR THE

COMPANY, AND FROM -3% TO 2% (AVERAGING -1%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE RESERVES REPRESENT

APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 1% FOR 2013, 7% FOR 2012 AND 5% FOR 2011. THE 2012 CHANGE REFLECTED HIGHER THAN EXPECTED SEVERITY IN THE BODILY INJURY

COVERAGE PRIMARILY FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2010 AND 2011. THE 2011 CHANGE REFLECTED HIGHER THAN EXPECTED SEVERITY FOR THE 2009 AND 2010 ACCIDENT YEARS.

WORKERS' COMPENSATION

WORKERS' COMPENSATION IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL COVERAGE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE CLAIMS

FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. WHILE CERTAIN PAYMENTS SUCH AS INITIAL MEDICAL TREATMENT OR TEMPORARY WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR THE INJURED WORKER ARE MADE QUICKLY, SOME OTHER PAYMENTS ARE MADE OVER THE COURSE

OF SEVERAL YEARS, SUCH AS AWARDS FOR PERMANENT PARTIAL INJURIES. IN ADDITION, SOME PAYMENTS CAN RUN AS LONG AS THE INJURED WORKER'S LIFE,

SUCH AS PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS AND ON-GOING MEDICAL CARE. DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY OF LONG PAYMENT TAILS, THE REPORTING LAGS ARE GENERALLY SHORT, SETTLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT COMPLEX, AND MOST

OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE CONSIDERED HIGH FREQUENCY WITH MODERATE SEVERITY. THE LARGEST RESERVE RISK GENERALLY COMES FROM THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY CLAIMS PROVIDING LIFETIME COVERAGE FOR MEDICAL

EXPENSE ARISING FROM A WORKER'S INJURY, AS SUCH CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER INFLATION RISK. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A SOMEWHAT GREATER THAN MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

WORKERS'

COMPENSATION RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN THREE COMPONENTS: INDEMNITY LOSSES, MEDICAL LOSSES AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

COMPENSATION, A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.3% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -2% TO 1% (AVERAGING 0%) FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM

-1% TO 2% (AVERAGING 0%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE

OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 35% OF THE COMPANY'S

TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -1% IN 2013, -2% IN 2012 AND 0% FOR 2011. THE 2012 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN

EXPECTED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY RELATED TO LIFETIME MEDICAL CLAIMS FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2008 AND PRIOR.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FIDELITY AND SURETY

FIDELITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. IT TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE FIDELITY

CLAIMS. THE VOLATILITY OF FIDELITY RESERVES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS OF THE INSURED, THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE INSURED'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT AND

ATTACHMENT POINT OF COVERAGE. THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING RESERVES FOR SMALL, COMMERCIAL INSUREDS IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN THE UNCERTAINTY FOR LARGE COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE HIGH

FREQUENCY, LOW SEVERITY NATURE OF SMALL COMMERCIAL FIDELITY LOSSES PROVIDES FOR STABILITY IN LOSS ESTIMATES, WHEREAS THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY NATURE OF LOSSES FOR LARGE INSUREDS RESULTS IN A

WIDER RANGE OF ULTIMATE LOSS OUTCOMES. ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES THAT RELY ON A STABLE PATTERN OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT ARE GENERALLY NOT APPLICABLE TO LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY POLICIES.

SURETY

HAS CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED SHORT TAIL COVERAGES WITH SHORT REPORTING LAGS, ALTHOUGH LARGE INDIVIDUAL CONSTRUCTION AND COMMERCIAL SURETY CONTRACTS CAN

RESULT IN A LONG SETTLEMENT TAIL, BASED ON THE LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OR COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION BEING INSURED. (LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS CAN TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE.)

THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES IN SURETY GENERALLY CORRELATES WITH ECONOMIC CYCLES AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF SURETY LOSS IS THE INABILITY OF AN INSURED CONTRACTOR TO FULFILL ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THE

COMPANY ACTIVELY SEEKS TO MITIGATE THIS EXPOSURE TO LOSS THROUGH DISCIPLINED RISK SELECTION AND ADHERENCE TO UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THE VOLATILITY OF SURETY LOSSES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF

BUSINESS PERFORMED BY THE INSURED, THE TYPE OF BONDED OBLIGATION, THE AMOUNT OF LIMIT EXPOSED TO LOSS AND THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS AVAILABLE TO THE INSURER TO MITIGATE LOSSES, SUCH AS UNBILLED CONTRACT

FUNDS, COLLATERAL, FIRST AND THIRD PARTY INDEMNITY, AND OTHER SECURITY POSITIONS OF AN INSURED'S ASSETS. CERTAIN CLASSES OF SURETY CLAIMS ARE VERY HIGH SEVERITY, LOW FREQUENCY IN NATURE. THESE CAN

INCLUDE LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS INVOLVED WITH ONE OR MULTIPLE LARGE, COMPLEX PROJECTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN LARGE COMMERCIAL SURETY EXPOSURES. OTHER CLAIM FACTORS AFFECTING RESERVE VARIABILITY OF

SURETY INCLUDE LITIGATION RELATED TO AMOUNTS OWED BY AND DUE THE INSURED (E.G., SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION EFFORTS) AND THE RESULTS OF FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF AN INSURED.

COMPANY, AND FROM -13% TO 24% (AVERAGING -1%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. FIDELITY AND SURETY RESERVES REPRESENT

APPROXIMATELY 2% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

IN

GENERAL, DEVELOPMENTS ON SINGLE LARGE CLAIMS (BOTH ADVERSE AND FAVORABLE) ARE A PRIMARY SOURCE OF CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -21% FOR 2013, -8% FOR 2012 AND -11% FOR 2011. THE 2013 CHANGE REFLECTED BETTER

THAN EXPECTED RESULTS PRIMARILY FOR THE CONTRACT SURETY LINE OF BUSINESS FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2010 AND PRIOR. THE 2012 CHANGE REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS PRIMARILY FOR THE CONTRACT SURETY

LINE OF BUSINESS FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2008 AND PRIOR. THE 2011 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2008 AND PRIOR FOR THE CONTRACT SURETY BUSINESS.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL

DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. REPORTING LAGS ARE

RELATIVELY SHORT AND THE CLAIM SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY GENERALLY IS THE LEAST COMPLEX OF THE LIABILITY PRODUCTS. IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO

MODERATE SEVERITY PRODUCT LINE. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

PERSONAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN FIVE COMPONENTS: BODILY INJURY LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY, NO-FAULT LOSSES, COLLISION CLAIMS AND COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS.

THESE LAST TWO COMPONENTS HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE FACTORS ARE NOT PRESENTED.

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE,

A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -9% TO 3% (AVERAGING -2%) FOR THE

COMPANY, AND FROM -4% TO -1% (AVERAGING -3%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING

THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE RESERVES

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 5% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 1% FOR 2013, 2% FOR 2012 AND 3% FOR 2011. THE 2012 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BODILY INJURY

HOMEOWNERS AND PERSONAL LINES OTHER

HOMEOWNERS IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. MOST PAYMENTS ARE RELATED TO THE PROPERTY PORTION OF THE POLICY, WHERE THE

CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE INSURER. CLAIMS ON PROPERTY COVERAGE ARE TYPICALLY REPORTED SOON AFTER THE ACTUAL DAMAGE OCCURS, ALTHOUGH DELAYS

OF SEVERAL MONTHS ARE NOT UNUSUAL. THE RESULTING SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS TYPICALLY FAIRLY SHORT TERM, ALTHOUGH EXCEPTIONS DO EXIST.

THE

LIABILITY PORTION OF THE HOMEOWNERS POLICY GENERATES CLAIMS WHICH TAKE LONGER TO PAY DUE TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF LITIGATION AND NEGOTIATION, BUT WITH GENERALLY SMALL REPORTING LAGS.

OVERALL,

THE LINE IS GENERALLY HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY (EXCEPT FOR CATASTROPHES), WITH SIMPLE TO MODERATE CLAIM COMPLEXITY.

HOMEOWNERS

RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN TWO COMPONENTS: NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED LOSSES AND CATASTROPHE LOSS PAYMENTS.

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR HOMEOWNERS AND

PERSONAL LINES OTHER, A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.0% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE (EXCLUDING THE UMBRELLA LINE OF BUSINESS, WHICH FOR STATUTORY REPORTING PURPOSES IS INCLUDED WITH THE

GENERAL LIABILITY LINE OF BUSINESS) OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -22% TO 3% (AVERAGING -9%) FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM -8% TO -2% (AVERAGING

-5%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL

OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. HOMEOWNERS AND PERSONAL LINES OTHER RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 2% OF THE COMPANY'S

TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

THIS

LINE COMBINES BOTH LIABILITY AND PROPERTY COVERAGES; HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVES RELATE TO PROPERTY. WHILE PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE, THE ONE YEAR

CHANGE FOR PROPERTY CAN BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THAT FOR THE LONGER TAIL PRODUCT LINES. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVE FOR PROPERTY RELATES TO THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR,

WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE MOST UNCERTAINTY FOR ALL PRODUCT LINES. THIS RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR UNCERTAINTY IS RELEVANT TO PROPERTY BECAUSE OF WEATHER RELATED EVENTS WHICH, NOTWITHSTANDING 2010 AND 2011

EXPERIENCE, TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, AND GENERALLY ARE NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. RESERVE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CATASTROPHES MAY TAKE

EVEN LONGER TO RESOLVE.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE (EXCLUDING THE UMBRELLA LINE OF BUSINESS) WAS -17% FOR 2013, -11% FOR 2012 AND -7% FOR

2011. THE 2013 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR CATASTROPHE LOSSES INCURRED IN 2012 AND NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES AND NON-WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES FOR

ACCIDENT YEARS 2012 AND 2011. THE 2012 CHANGE REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES INCURRED IN 2011 AND NON-CATASTROPHE LOSSES INCURRED IN ACCIDENT YEARS 2010

AND 2011. THE 2011 CHANGE REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES INCURRED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010.

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER INCLUDES PRODUCTS WRITTEN BY THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS ALL OTHER PRODUCTS NOT

EXPLICITLY DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF "OTHER" CLAIM RESERVES IS ASSUMED REINSURANCE WRITTEN ON AN EXCESS-OF-LOSS BASIS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE REINSURANCE OF NON-U.S. EXPOSURES, AND IS

RUNOFF BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL

AND OTHER CLAIM LIABILITIES RESULT FROM A MIX OF COVERAGES, CURRENCIES AND JURISDICTIONS/COUNTRIES. THE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC IS THE NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE ANALYSIS TO THE

INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT, AND THE INABILITY TO RELY ON DATA CHARACTERIZATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. STATUTORY REPORTING FRAMEWORK.

DUE

TO CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS MIX FOR THIS LINE OVER TIME, INCLUDING THE RECENT ACQUISITION OF DOMINION, THE RECENTLY INCURRED CLAIM LIABILITIES ARE RELATIVELY SHORTER TAIL (DUE TO BOTH

THE PRODUCTS AND THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED, E.G., CANADA, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM), WHILE THE OLDER LIABILITIES INCLUDE SOME FROM RUNOFF OPERATIONS THAT ARE EXTREMELY

LONG TAIL (E.G., U.S. EXCESS LIABILITIES REINSURED THROUGH THE LONDON MARKET, AND SEVERAL UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF). THE SPEED

153

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF

CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION, THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (E.G., UNDERWRITING POOL VERSUS DIRECT) AND THE PROXIMITY OF

THE INSURANCE SALE TO THE INSURED HAZARD (E.G., INSURED AND INSURER LOCATED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES). IN PARTICULAR, LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF MAY RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS, SETTLEMENT LAGS AND CLAIM COMPLEXITY, DUE TO THE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER POOL MEMBERS OR CO-INSURERS THROUGH A BROKER OR LEAD-INSURER FOR CLAIM SETTLEMENT PURPOSES.

INTERNATIONAL

RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED BY COUNTRY AND GENERAL COVERAGE CATEGORY (E.G. GENERAL LIABILITY IN CANADA, COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, ETC.). THE

BUSINESS IS ALSO GENERALLY SPLIT BY DIRECT VERSUS ASSUMED REINSURANCE FOR A GIVEN COVERAGE. WHERE THE UNDERLYING INSURED HAZARD IS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE UNDERLYING COVERAGES ARE GENERALLY

SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER THE HOMEOWNERS, PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND SURETY DISCUSSIONS ABOVE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENCES IN THE

LEGAL ENVIRONMENT AND DIFFERENCES IN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THERE ARE NO AGGREGATE POLICY LIMITS ON CERTAIN LIABILITY COVERAGES.

OTHER

RESERVES, PRIMARILY ASSUMED REINSURANCE IN RUNOFF, ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED BY PROGRAM/POOL, TREATY TYPE, AND GENERAL COVERAGE CATEGORY (E.G. GENERAL

LIABILITYEXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE). EXCESS EXPOSURE REQUIRES THE INSURED TO "PROVE" NOT ONLY CLAIMS UNDER THE POLICY, BUT ALSO THE PRIOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS REACHING UP TO THE EXCESS

POLICY'S ATTACHMENT POINT.

POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS MIX OF RUNOFF BUSINESS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCLUDED COMPARATIVE ANALYSES FOR INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND

MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY BECOMES INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO

DETERMINE THE COMPANY'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS AND

DISPUTES.

THE

COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO TWO REINSURANCE CONTRACTS IN CONNECTION WITH CATASTROPHE BONDS ISSUED BY LONG POINT RE III. BOTH OF THESE CONTRACTS MEET THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR

AS REINSURANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDANCE FOR ACCOUNTING FOR REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. THE CATASTROPHE BONDS ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN "ITEM 1BUSINESSCATASTROPHE

REINSURANCE."

THE

COMPANY REPORTS ITS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ONGOING REVIEW OF

AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES. FROM TIME TO TIME, AS A RESULT OF THE

LONG-TAILED NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING LIABILITIES, COVERAGE COMPLEXITIES AND POTENTIAL FOR DISPUTES, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE COMMUTATION OF REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES AND COMMUTATION ACTIVITY COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES.

RECOVERABLES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS RELATE PRIMARILY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION, FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COMPANIES ISSUING THE ANNUITIES. RECOVERABLES ATTRIBUTABLE TO MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS RELATE

PRIMARILY TO WORKERS' COMPENSATION SERVICE BUSINESS. THESE RECOVERABLES ARE SUPPORTED BY THE PARTICIPATING INSURANCE COMPANIES' OBLIGATION TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE BASED ON EACH COMPANY'S VOLUNTARY

MARKET SHARE OF WRITTEN PREMIUM IN EACH STATE IN WHICH IT IS A POOL PARTICIPANT. IN THE EVENT A MEMBER OF A MANDATORY POOL OR ASSOCIATION DEFAULTS ON ITS SHARE OF THE POOL'S OR ASSOCIATION'S

OBLIGATIONS, THE OTHER MEMBERS' SHARE OF SUCH OBLIGATION INCREASES PROPORTIONALLY.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENT VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENTS

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN THE FAIR

VALUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON THE INPUTS USED IN VALUATION, GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND REQUIRES THAT

155

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OBSERVABLE

INPUTS BE USED IN THE VALUATIONS WHEN AVAILABLE. THE DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON WHETHER THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS INTO THE

VALUATION ARE OBSERVABLE. IN DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY IN WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS DISCLOSED, THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND THE LOWEST

PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT MARKET ASSUMPTIONS. THE LEVEL IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WITHIN WHICH THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS REPORTED IS BASED ON THE

LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE THREE LEVELS OF THE HIERARCHY ARE AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1UNADJUSTED QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT THE

COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS.



LEVEL 2QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL

OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS; OR VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE (E.G., INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULT

RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, ETC.) OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.



LEVEL 3VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

REFLECT THE COMPANY'S OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE INPUTS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE, UNRELATED, WILLING PARTIES, I.E., NOT IN A FORCED TRANSACTION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MAY DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED IF THE

SECURITY WAS SOLD IN AN IMMEDIATE SALE, E.G., A FORCED TRANSACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE LESS LIQUID DUE TO THE LACK OF MARKET BASED

INPUTS, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE PRICE AT WHICH AN ACTUAL TRANSACTION WOULD OCCUR.

FOR

INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, THE COMPANY USES THE UNADJUSTED QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDES THESE PRICES IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN

LEVEL 1 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES FROM A THIRD PARTY, NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICE (PRICING SERVICE). WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE UNAVAILABLE,

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS MAINLY USED FOR ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES PROVIDED FROM THIS PRICING SERVICE ARE

INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND AN ESTIMATE FROM A PRICING SERVICE ARE UNAVAILABLE, THE COMPANY PRODUCES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE

BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, WILL RENDER THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE AS LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3. THE COMPANY

BASES ALL OF ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR ASSETS ON THE BID PRICE AS IT REPRESENTS WHAT A THIRD-PARTY MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY IN AN ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION.

FIXED MATURITIES

THE COMPANY UTILIZED A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 98% OF ITS FIXED MATURITIES AT BOTH

DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012. THE PRICING SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. SINCE FIXED MATURITIES OTHER THAN U.S.

TREASURY SECURITIES GENERALLY DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY BASIS, THE PRICING SERVICE PREPARES ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR THESE SECURITIES USING ITS PROPRIETARY PRICING APPLICATIONS, WHICH

INCLUDE AVAILABLE RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, BENCHMARK CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR GROUPINGS AND MATRIX PRICING. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRICING SERVICE USES AN OPTION ADJUSTED SPREAD

MODEL TO DEVELOP PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS.

156

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

PRICING SERVICE EVALUATES EACH ASSET CLASS BASED ON RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, RELEVANT CREDIT INFORMATION, PERCEIVED MARKET MOVEMENTS AND SECTOR NEWS. THE MARKET INPUTS UTILIZED

IN THE PRICING EVALUATION, LISTED IN THE APPROXIMATE ORDER OF PRIORITY, INCLUDE: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES, BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, TWO-SIDED MARKETS, BENCHMARK SECURITIES, BIDS,

OFFERS, REFERENCE DATA, AND INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. THE EXTENT OF THE USE OF EACH MARKET INPUT DEPENDS ON THE ASSET CLASS AND THE MARKET CONDITIONS. DEPENDING ON THE SECURITY, THE PRIORITY OF

THE USE OF INPUTS MAY CHANGE OR SOME MARKET INPUTS MAY NOT BE RELEVANT. FOR SOME SECURITIES, ADDITIONAL INPUTS MAY BE NECESSARY.

THE

PRICING SERVICE UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL ONLY PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IF THERE IS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE INFORMATION TO PRODUCE A VALUATION. IF

THE PRICING SERVICE DISCONTINUES PRICING AN INVESTMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE USING SOME OF THE SAME METHODOLOGIES AS THE PRICING SERVICE BUT WOULD HAVE TO

MAKE ASSUMPTIONS FOR MARKET-BASED INPUTS THAT ARE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF MOST FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION RATHER THAN MARKET QUOTES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH FIXED

MATURITIES, OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES IS INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 AS THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON UNADJUSTED MARKET PRICES.

THE

COMPANY REVIEWS THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE AND COMPARES THE ESTIMATES TO THE COMPANY'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE MARKET TO DETERMINE IF THE ESTIMATES OBTAINED

ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PRICES IN THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS PERIODIC DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRICING SERVICE TO DISCUSS ANY CHANGES IN THEIR PROCESS AND REACTIONS TO OVERALL MARKETS. THE

COMPANY PRODUCES A REPORT MONTHLY THAT LISTS ALL PRICE CHANGES FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH IN EXCESS OF 10%. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE REPORT AND WILL CHALLENGE ANY PRICES DEEMED NOT TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF

FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS OTHER PROCESSES INCLUDING RANDOMLY SELECTING PURCHASED OR SOLD SECURITIES AND COMPARING EXECUTION PRICES TO THE ESTIMATES FROM THE PRICING

SERVICE AS WELL AS REVIEWING REPORTS THAT CONTAIN SECURITIES WHOSE VALUATION DID NOT CHANGE FROM THEIR PREVIOUS VALUATION (STALE PRICE REVIEW). THE COMPANY ALSO USES AN ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT PRICING

SERVICE TO FURTHER TEST THE PRIMARY PRICING SERVICE'S VALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO. THESE PROCESSES HAVE NOT HIGHLIGHTED ANY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES

RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HOLDS CERTAIN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE NOT PRICED BY THE PRICING SERVICE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH FIXED MATURITIES USING AN

INTERNAL MATRIX THAT IS BASED ON MARKET INFORMATION REGARDING INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND LIQUIDITY. THE UNDERLYING SOURCE DATA FOR CALCULATING THE MATRIX OF CREDIT SPREADS RELATIVE TO THE U.S.

TREASURY CURVE ARE THE BOFA MERRILL LYNCH U.S. CORPORATE INDEX AND THE BOFA MERRILL LYNCH HIGH YIELD BB RATED INDEX. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF THESE CORPORATE BONDS IN

LEVEL 2, SINCE ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE MARKET OBSERVABLE.

WHILE

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S MUNICIPAL BONDS AND CORPORATE BONDS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2, THE COMPANY HOLDS A NUMBER OF MUNICIPAL BONDS AND CORPORATE BONDS WHICH ARE

NOT VALUED BY THE PRICING SERVICE AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL PRICING MATRIX WITH SOME UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUATION. DUE TO THE LIMITED

AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THESE PARTICULAR BONDS IN LEVEL 3. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY USED

AN INTERNAL PRICING MATRIX WAS $94 MILLION AND $102 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL AMOUNT OF OTHER FIXED MATURITY

INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE THEM UNSUITABLE FOR MATRIX PRICING. FOR THESE FIXED MATURITIES, THE COMPANY OBTAINS A QUOTE FROM A BROKER (PRIMARILY THE MARKET MAKER). THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE FIXED MATURITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY

157

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECEIVED

A BROKER QUOTE WAS $161 MILLION AND $128 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. DUE TO THE DISCLAIMERS ON THE QUOTES THAT INDICATE THAT THE PRICE IS

INDICATIVE ONLY, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN LEVEL 3.

NON-FIXED MATURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS NOT REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE

SEE NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF

NON-FIXED MATURITIES AND VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS NOT REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS A PERIODIC REVIEW TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE INVESTED ASSETS HAVING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. SOME OF THE

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IDENTIFYING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE: (1) FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, WHETHER THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SELL THE INVESTMENT OR WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE INVESTMENT PRIOR TO AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (2) FOR NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO RETAIN

THE INVESTMENT FOR A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (3) THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST FOR FIXED MATURITY

SECURITIES (I.E., WHETHER THERE IS A CREDIT LOSS) OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; (4) THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN AMORTIZED COST FOR FIXED

MATURITY SECURITIES OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND (5) THE FINANCIAL CONDITION, NEAR-TERM AND LONG-TERM

PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING THE RELEVANT INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND TRENDS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS AND OFFERING PRICES.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES

FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL OR FOR WHICH IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WOULD

NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL BEFORE AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE, THE COMPANY SEPARATES THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT OF THE IMPAIRMENT FROM THE AMOUNT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS AND REPORTS THE CREDIT

LOSS COMPONENT IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS IS REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FOR

EQUITY SECURITIES (INCLUDING PUBLIC COMMON AND NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK) AND FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SELL OR FOR WHICH IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL BEFORE AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE, THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS INCLUDED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

UPON

RECOGNIZING AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THE NEW COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT IS THE PREVIOUS AMORTIZED COST BASIS LESS THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RECOGNIZED IN NET

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE NEW COST BASIS IS NOT ADJUSTED FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE; HOWEVER, FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW COST BASIS

AND THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IS ACCRETED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO NET INVESTMENT INCOME OVER THE REMAINING EXPECTED LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT.

DUE

TO THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S ANALYSIS AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, ALONG WITH THE JUDGMENT THAT MUST BE APPLIED IN THE ANALYSIS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANY

COULD REACH A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPAIR A SECURITY IF IT HAD ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUER. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ISSUER'S ACTUAL ABILITY TO

MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE COMPANY DETERMINED DURING ITS ANALYSIS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO A DIFFERENT IMPAIRMENT CONCLUSION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

UPDATES.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO PREPARE ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP), AS PROMULGATED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB). DURING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) HAS BEEN EVALUATING WHETHER, WHEN AND HOW INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) SHOULD

BE INCORPORATED INTO THE U.S. FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEM. BEFORE MAKING A DECISION, THE SEC SET FORTH A WORK PLAN TO EVALUATE THE REMAINING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GAAP AND IFRS, DETERMINE WHETHER IFRS

REPRESENTED HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS, CONSIDER HOW THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD IS FUNDED AND ITS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, AND EXAMINE THE VARIATIONS IN THE WAY IFRS WAS APPLIED BY VARIOUS

FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT FILE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH THE SEC. IN JULY 2012, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED A FINAL REPORT ON THE SEC WORK PLAN WHICH CONCLUDED THAT IFRS PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS, BUT ALSO INDICATED CONCERNS WITH FUNDING, CONSISTENCY OF APPLICATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF IFRS GLOBALLY. THE REPORT DID NOT GIVE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE SEC ON WHETHER, WHEN AND HOW IFRS

SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE U.S. FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY, THE SEC HAS NOT INDICATED A TIMELINE FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF INCORPORATING IFRS.

THE

INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (IASB) AND THE FASB HAVE A CONVERGENCE PROGRAM WITH THE INTENT OF DEVELOPING GLOBAL STANDARDS FOR SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF ACCOUNTING,

INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS. IN JUNE 2012, THE FASB ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT INDICATED THAT BASED ON THE NATURE AND TOTALITY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FASB'S AND IASB'S VIEWS, IT

IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE TWO BOARDS WILL ACHIEVE CONVERGENCE ON THIS PROJECT. THE FASB FURTHER NOTED THAT THE FASB AND IASB HAVE VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE PROJECT, GIVEN THAT THE U.S. HAS

EXISTING GUIDANCE ON INSURANCE CONTRACTS WHEREAS THERE IS CURRENTLY NO COMPREHENSIVE IFRS ACCOUNTING STANDARD FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS. IN JUNE 2013, EACH BOARD ISSUED FOR COMMENT AN EXPOSURE DRAFT OF

THE ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS THAT HAS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FROM THE OTHER BOARD'S DRAFT AS WELL AS FROM CURRENT GAAP. BOTH EXPOSURE DRAFTS PROPOSE CHANGES THAT, IF ULTIMATELY ADOPTED,

COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ACCOUNTING BY INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, FOR PREMIUMS AND UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES, THE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, REINSURANCE, AND

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS. THE BOARDS ARE REVIEWING THE COMMENTS RECEIVED ON THE EXPOSURE DRAFTS AND ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN RE-DELIBERATIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014. AS A RESULT OF THIS, IT IS

CURRENTLY UNCLEAR WHAT CHANGES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS UNDER GAAP AS A RESULT OF THIS PROJECT. ADDITIONALLY, ANY NEW STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BOARDS REGARDING

INSURANCE CONTRACTS MAY INVOLVE METHODOLOGIES FOR VALUING INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE METHODOLOGIES REQUIRED BY CURRENT U.S. GAAP. IT IS ALSO

POSSIBLE THAT THE BOARDS COULD ISSUE DIFFERENT FINAL STANDARDS THAT COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY HAVING TO APPLY AN ACCOUNTING STANDARD FOR ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM

THE ACCOUNTING STANDARD USED FOR LOCAL REPORTING IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.

159

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

FASB AND THE IASB ALSO CONTINUE TO DELIBERATE THE THREE REMAINING PROJECTS INTENDED TO BRING CONVERGENCE BETWEEN GAAP AND IFRS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION, ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, AND LEASING. THE REVENUE RECOGNITION PROJECT IS LARGELY CONVERGED AND THE BOARDS ARE EXPECTED TO ISSUE FINAL GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2014, WHILE THE BOARDS CURRENTLY HAVE DIFFERENT

POSITIONS ON CERTAIN KEY ASPECTS OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT PROJECT (THE CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT AND IMPAIRMENT). BOTH BOARDS INTEND TO COMPLETE THEIR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT PROJECT DURING THE

FIRST HALF OF 2014. THE TIMING OF THE LEASING PROJECT IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME.

THE

COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER IT WILL CHOOSE TO, OR BE REQUIRED TO, ADOPT IFRS OR HOW THE ADOPTION OF IFRS (OR THE POTENTIAL CONVERGENCE OF GAAP AND IFRS, INCLUDING THE

JOINT PROJECT FOR VALUING INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES) MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND PRICES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT

SPREADS), FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND OTHER RELEVANT MARKET RATE OR PRICE CHANGES. MARKET RISK IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE RELATED

UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE TRADED. THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES AND HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. THE COMPANY'S MARKET RISK

SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES, ARE PRIMARILY ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING.

THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 WAS $73.16 BILLION AND $73.84 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 87% AND 89% WAS

INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, APPROXIMATELY 9.3% AND 6.2%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS WERE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. THE INCREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF DOMINION. THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO EQUITY PRICE RISK IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE

COMPANY HAS NO DIRECT COMMODITY RISK AND IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS.

THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISKS TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ARE INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES. THE PORTFOLIO DURATION IS PRIMARILY

MANAGED THROUGH CASH MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND TREASURY FUTURES TRANSACTIONS. IN 2013, THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO OF FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM SECURITY

INVESTMENTS INCREASED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE YEAR. BY THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013, BASED UPON THE OUTLOOK FOR INTEREST RATES, THE

COMPANY CLOSED ALL OF ITS SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS, WHICH IT HAD USED TO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO A DECREASE IN ITS BOOK VALUE RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN INTEREST

RATES. DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2013, THE COMPANY DID NOT ENTER INTO ANY U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY MAY ONCE AGAIN ENTER INTO POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES IN FUTURE PERIODS TO

HELP MANAGE THE DURATION OF ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTES 3 AND 4 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE "INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO" AND "OUTLOOK" SECTIONS OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS."

THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISK FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT IS INTEREST RATE RISK AT THE TIME OF REFINANCING. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND EVALUATES REFINANCING

OPPORTUNITIES AS MATURITY DATES APPROACH. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S DEBT SEE NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE

"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" SECTION OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS."

THE

COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURE IS CONCENTRATED IN THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS, INSURANCE RESERVES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. CASH

FLOWS FROM

THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY TO FUND INSURANCE

RESERVES AND OTHER LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN THE SAME CURRENCY, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR COMPRISED

APPROXIMATELY 5.5% AND 2.3% OF THE TOTAL INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S

ACQUISITION OF DOMINION. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 2.4% OF THE TOTAL INVESTED ASSETS AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012. INVESTED ASSETS

DENOMINATED IN OTHER CURRENCIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 WERE NOT MATERIAL.

161

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THERE

WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES WERE MANAGED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 COMPARED TO THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ITS PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN FUTURE REPORTING

PERIODS BASED UPON WHAT IS KNOWN OR EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS DEFINED AS THE MEASUREMENT OF POTENTIAL LOSS IN FUTURE EARNINGS, FAIR VALUES OR CASH FLOWS OF MARKET SENSITIVE

INSTRUMENTS RESULTING FROM ONE OR MORE SELECTED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET RATES OR PRICES OVER A SELECTED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE COMPANY'S SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, A

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET RATES IS SELECTED THAT IS EXPECTED TO REFLECT REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN THOSE RATES. "NEAR-TERM" MEANS A PERIOD OF TIME GOING FORWARD UP TO ONE YEAR FROM

THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET RATES ASSUMED IN THIS DISCLOSURE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS DOES

NOT REFLECT THE RESULTS OF ANY ACTIONS THAT WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE COMPANY TO MITIGATE SUCH HYPOTHETICAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE.

INTEREST RATE RISK

IN THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL INCLUDES

THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING: FIXED MATURITIES, NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, MORTGAGE LOANS,

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, DEBT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO THE COMPANY'S MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INTEREST RATE RISK (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS). THE

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USES VARIOUS BASIS POINT CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES TO MEASURE THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MODEL.

FOR

INVESTED ASSETS WITH PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, ESTIMATES OF PORTFOLIO DURATION AND CONVEXITY ARE USED TO MODEL THE LOSS OF FAIR VALUE THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO RESULT

FROM A PARALLEL INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES. DURATIONS ON INVESTED ASSETS ARE ADJUSTED FOR CALL, PUT AND INTEREST RATE RESET FEATURES. DURATIONS ON TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES ARE ADJUSTED FOR THE FACT THAT

THE YIELDS ON SUCH SECURITIES DO NOT NORMALLY MOVE IN LOCKSTEP WITH CHANGES IN THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE. FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO DURATIONS ARE CALCULATED ON A MARKET VALUE WEIGHTED BASIS, INCLUDING

ACCRUED INTEREST, USING HOLDINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012.

FOR

DEBT, THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY CALCULATING HYPOTHETICAL DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 ENDING PRICES BASED ON YIELDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE,

COMPARING SUCH HYPOTHETICAL ENDING PRICES TO ACTUAL ENDING PRICES, AND MULTIPLYING THE DIFFERENCE BY THE PAR OR SECURITIES OUTSTANDING.

THE

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USED BY THE COMPANY PRODUCES A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.90 BILLION AND $1.64 BILLION BASED ON A

100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

LOSS ESTIMATES DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE INTERVENTIONS THAT THE COMPANY MIGHT REASONABLY UNDERTAKE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE OR AVOID LOSSES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM

EMERGING INTEREST RATE TRENDS. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS VALUE ONLY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF AN INTEREST RATE INCREASE ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS FROM FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS. A

HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IS

162

TABLE OF CONTENTS

USED

TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FOREIGN DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. THE COMPANY'S ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT A HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS

WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $681 MILLION AND $459 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THIS INCREASE IN THE PROJECTED LOSS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF DOMINION.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE

COMPANY). THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE 2012 AND 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM TO THE

2013 PRESENTATION. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

ON

NOVEMBER 1, 2013, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF DOMINION FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.034 BILLION. DOMINION

PRIMARILY MARKETS PERSONAL LINES AND SMALL COMMERCIAL INSURANCE BUSINESS IN CANADA. AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, THE COMPANY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE $3.91 BILLION OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND

$2.88 BILLION OF LIABILITIES ASSUMED AS PART OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING $16 MILLION OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND $273 MILLION OF GOODWILL. THE OPERATING INCOME AND

THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM DOMINION WERE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT EFFECTIVE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVE RELATED TO THE ACQUIRED INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WAS CARRIED

OVER AND INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVE. PREMIUM REVENUE FROM THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS WILL BE RECOGNIZED ON A PRO RATA BASIS BEGINNING WITH THE ACQUISITION DATE OVER THE REMAINING

POLICY TERMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICY. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN INTANGIBLE ASSET FOR THE VALUE OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED (VOBA) OF $76 MILLION AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.

VOBA REPRESENTS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE GROSS PROFITS OF THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED FROM DOMINION, IS REPORTED AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS, AND WILL BE AMORTIZED IN PROPORTION

TO THE PREMIUM REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS.

ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES

REPORTING OF AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO IMPROVE THE REPORTING OF RECLASSIFICATIONS

OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO PRESENT, EITHER ON THE FACE OF THE STATEMENT OF INCOME OR IN THE NOTES, SEPARATELY FOR EACH COMPONENT OF COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME, THE CURRENT PERIOD RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME BY THE RESPECTIVE LINE ITEMS OF NET INCOME AFFECTED BY THE RECLASSIFICATION.

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2012. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE UPDATED GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2013,

AND SUCH ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED

OBLIGATIONS RESULTING FROM JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION IS FIXED AT THE REPORTING DATE

IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO RESOLVE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE CONCERNING THE RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, AND

DISCLOSURE OF OBLIGATIONS RESULTING FROM CERTAIN JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE TOTAL AMOUNT UNDER THE ARRANGEMENT IS FIXED AT THE REPORTING DATE. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT

THE REPORTING ENTITY MEASURE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ARRANGEMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE GUIDANCE AS THE AMOUNT THE REPORTING ENTITY AGREED TO PAY ON THE BASIS OF ITS ARRANGEMENT AMONG THE

CO-OBLIGORS AND ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNT THE REPORTING ENTITY EXPECTS TO PAY ON BEHALF OF ITS CO-OBLIGORS. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2014. THE ADOPTION OF

THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

PARENT'S ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT UPON DERECOGNITION OF CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OR GROUPS OF ASSETS WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY OR OF AN INVESTMENT IN A

FOREIGN ENTITY

IN MARCH 2013, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO RESOLVE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE CONCERNING THE RELEASE OF THE CUMULATIVE FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT INTO NET INCOME WHEN A PARENT SELLS A PART OR ALL OF ITS INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN ENTITY OR NO LONGER HOLDS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF

ASSETS WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY. WHEN A COMPANY CEASES TO HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A SUBSIDIARY WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY, THE COMPANY SHOULD RECOGNIZE ANY RELATED CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENT INTO NET INCOME ONLY IF THE SALE OR TRANSFER RESULTS IN THE COMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION OF THE FOREIGN ENTITY IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY HAD RESIDED. UPON THE PARTIAL SALE

OF AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT THAT IS A FOREIGN ENTITY, THE COMPANY SHOULD RELEASE INTO EARNINGS A PRO RATA PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. UPON THE PARTIAL SALE OF AN EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENT THAT IS NOT A FOREIGN ENTITY, THE COMPANY SHOULD RELEASE INTO EARNINGS THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT IF THE PARTIAL SALE REPRESENTS A COMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION

OF THE FOREIGN ENTITY THAT HOLDS THE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2014. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OWNED. REAL ESTATE IS RECORDED ON THE PURCHASE DATE AT THE PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH GENERALLY REPRESENTS FAIR VALUE, AND IS SUPPORTED BY INTERNAL ANALYSIS OR EXTERNAL APPRAISALS THAT USE DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW ANALYSES AND OTHER ACCEPTABLE VALUATION TECHNIQUES. REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES IS SUBSEQUENTLY CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION.

BUILDINGS

ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SHORTER OF THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OF THE BUILDING OR 39 YEARS. REAL ESTATE HELD FOR SALE IS CARRIED AT LOWER OF COST

OR FAIR VALUE, LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO SELL.

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES HAVE AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR AND ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS

THE

COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. THE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE HEDGE FUNDS GENERALLY REPORT

INVESTMENTS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED BY THE INVESTEE ARE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY ON A LAG BASIS, WITH THE LAG PERIOD GENERALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE TYPE OF

UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. THE PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION QUARTERLY WHICH IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WITHIN THREE TO SIX

MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE HEDGE FUNDS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION MONTHLY, WHICH IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS WITHIN ONE MONTH FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE REPORTING

PERIOD. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REQUESTS FINANCIAL INFORMATION FROM THE PARTNERSHIPS PRIOR TO THE RECEIPT OF THE PARTNERSHIPS' FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RECORDS ANY MATERIAL INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM

THESE REQUESTS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OTHER

ALSO

INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITIES, TRADING SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES. NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITIES

ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, NET OF INCOME TAXES, CHARGED OR CREDITED DIRECTLY TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. TRADING SECURITIES ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH THE CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE RECOGNIZED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE COMPANY SOLD ALL OF ITS REMAINING TRADING SECURITIES DURING 2013. THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE CARRIED AT

FAIR VALUE,

WITH THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE DERIVATIVES USED BY THE COMPANY, SEE

NOTE 3.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

INVESTMENT INCOME FROM FIXED MATURITIES IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONSTANT EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD WHICH INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT FOR

ESTIMATED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS, IF ANY. THE EFFECTIVE YIELD USED TO DETERMINE AMORTIZATION FOR FIXED MATURITIES SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK (E.G., ASSET-BACKED,

LOAN-BACKED

AND STRUCTURED SECURITIES) IS RECALCULATED AND ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY BASED UPON ACTUAL HISTORICAL AND/OR PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM A WIDELY-ACCEPTED SECURITIES

DATA PROVIDER. THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE YIELD FOR HIGHLY RATED PREPAYABLE FIXED MATURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE YIELD FOR NON-HIGHLY RATED PREPAYABLE

FIXED MATURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PROSPECTIVE METHOD. DIVIDENDS ON EQUITY SECURITIES (INCLUDING THOSE WITH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS) ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME WHEN DECLARED. RENTAL INCOME ON

REAL ESTATE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. SEE NOTE 3 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, REAL ESTATE

PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHEREBY THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF THE INVESTEE'S EARNINGS OR LOSSES IN THE FUND IS REPORTED IN NET INVESTMENT

INCOME. TRADING SECURITIES WERE MARKED TO MARKET WITH THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE COMPANY SOLD ALL OF ITS REMAINING TRADING SECURITIES

IN 2013.

ACCRUAL

OF INCOME IS SUSPENDED ON NON-SECURITIZED FIXED MATURITIES THAT ARE IN DEFAULT, OR ON WHICH IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AS SCHEDULED. INTEREST INCOME ON

INVESTMENTS IN DEFAULT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED. INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET THAT WERE NOT INCOME-PRODUCING FOR THE PRECEDING 12 MONTHS WERE NOT

MATERIAL.

FOR

FIXED MATURITIES WHERE THE COMPANY RECORDS AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, A DETERMINATION IS MADE AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND WHETHER THE COMPANY EXPECTS A RECOVERY IN

THE VALUE. FOR FIXED MATURITIES WHERE THE COMPANY EXPECTS A RECOVERY IN VALUE, NOT NECESSARILY TO PAR, THE CONSTANT EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD IS UTILIZED, AND THE INVESTMENT IS AMORTIZED TO THE EXPECTED

RECOVERY AMOUNT.

INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF PRETAX REVENUES BASED UPON SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE

INVESTMENTS SOLD ON THE TRADE DATE. INCLUDED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON INVESTED ASSETS OTHER THAN THOSE INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AS DESCRIBED IN THE "INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS" SECTION THAT FOLLOWS.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS A PERIODIC REVIEW TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE INVESTED ASSETS HAVING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. SOME OF THE

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IDENTIFYING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE: (1) FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, WHETHER THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SELL THE INVESTMENT OR WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE INVESTMENT PRIOR TO AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (2) FOR NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO RETAIN

THE INVESTMENT FOR A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (3) THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST FOR FIXED MATURITY

SECURITIES (I.E., WHETHER THERE IS A CREDIT LOSS) OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; (4) THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN AMORTIZED COST FOR FIXED

MATURITY SECURITIES OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND (5) THE FINANCIAL CONDITION, NEAR-TERM AND LONG-TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING THE RELEVANT INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND TRENDS, AND

IMPLICATIONS OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS AND OFFERING PRICES.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS OF FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES

FOR

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL OR FOR WHICH IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL

BEFORE AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE, THE COMPANY SEPARATES THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT OF THE IMPAIRMENT FROM THE AMOUNT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS AND REPORTS THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT IN NET

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS IS REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FOR

EQUITY SECURITIES (INCLUDING PUBLIC COMMON AND NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK) AND FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SELL OR FOR WHICH IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL BEFORE AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE, THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS INCLUDED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

UPON

RECOGNIZING AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THE NEW COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT IS THE PREVIOUS AMORTIZED COST BASIS LESS THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RECOGNIZED IN NET

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE NEW COST BASIS IS NOT ADJUSTED FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE; HOWEVER, FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW COST BASIS

AND THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IS ACCRETED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO NET INVESTMENT INCOME OVER THE REMAINING EXPECTED LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT.

DETERMINATION OF CREDIT LOSSFIXED MATURITIES

THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS BY UTILIZING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELING TO DETERMINE

THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE SECURITY AND COMPARING THE PRESENT VALUE WITH THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE SECURITY. IF THE AMORTIZED COST IS GREATER THAN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, THE

DIFFERENCE IS CONSIDERED A CREDIT LOSS AND RECOGNIZED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

FOR

NON-STRUCTURED FIXED MATURITIES (U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL

SUBDIVISIONS, DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AND CERTAIN CORPORATE DEBT), THE ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IS DETERMINED BY PROJECTING A RECOVERY VALUE AND A RECOVERY TIME FRAME AND

ASSESSING WHETHER FURTHER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WILL BE RECEIVED. THE DETERMINATION OF RECOVERY VALUE INCORPORATES AN ISSUER VALUATION ASSUMPTION UTILIZING ONE OR A COMBINATION OF VALUATION METHODS

AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE UNDISCOUNTED RECOVERY VALUE BY ALLOCATING THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE ISSUER TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF THE PRIORITY OF CLAIMS. THE

PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE SECURITY AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION (OR THE MOST RECENT IMPLIED RATE USED TO ACCRETE THE SECURITY IF THE IMPLIED

RATE HAS CHANGED AS A RESULT OF A PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT) AND AN ESTIMATED RECOVERY TIME FRAME. GENERALLY, THAT TIME FRAME FOR SECURITIES FOR WHICH THE ISSUER IS IN BANKRUPTCY IS 12 MONTHS. FOR

SECURITIES FOR WHICH THE ISSUER IS FINANCIALLY TROUBLED BUT NOT IN BANKRUPTCY, THAT TIME FRAME IS GENERALLY 24 MONTHS. INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION ARE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND

INTEREST PAYMENTS; HOWEVER, FOR SECURITIES FOR WHICH THE ISSUER IS CLASSIFIED AS BANKRUPT OR IN DEFAULT, THE PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION ASSUMES NO INTEREST PAYMENTS AND A SINGLE RECOVERY AMOUNT.

IN

ESTIMATING THE RECOVERY VALUE, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO A MYRIAD OF FACTORS RELATED TO THE ISSUER INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

REVENUE, MARGIN AND EARNINGS PROJECTIONS, THE LIKELY MARKET OR LIQUIDATION VALUES OF ASSETS, POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL

DEBT

TO BE INCURRED PRE- OR POST-BANKRUPTCY/RESTRUCTURING, THE ABILITY TO SHIFT EXISTING OR NEW DEBT TO DIFFERENT PRIORITY LAYERS, THE AMOUNT OF RESTRUCTURING/BANKRUPTCY EXPENSES, THE SIZE AND

PRIORITY OF UNFUNDED PENSION OBLIGATIONS, LITIGATION OR OTHER CONTINGENT CLAIMS, THE TREATMENT OF INTERCOMPANY CLAIMS AND THE LIKELY OUTCOME WITH RESPECT TO INTER-CREDITOR CONFLICTS.

FOR

STRUCTURED FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES (PRIMARILY RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE

SECURITY BY PROJECTING FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSETS UNDERLYING THE SECURITIZATION, ALLOCATING THE FLOWS TO THE VARIOUS TRANCHES BASED ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION AND DETERMINING THE

PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS USING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE SECURITY AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION (OR THE MOST RECENT IMPLIED RATE USED TO ACCRETE THE SECURITY IF THE IMPLIED RATE HAS CHANGED AS A

RESULT OF A PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT OR CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS). THE COMPANY INCORPORATES LEVELS OF DELINQUENCIES, DEFAULTS AND SEVERITIES AS WELL AS CREDIT ATTRIBUTES OF THE REMAINING ASSETS IN

THE SECURITIZATION, ALONG WITH OTHER ECONOMIC DATA, TO ARRIVE AT ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE PARAMETERS APPLIED TO THE ASSETS UNDERLYING THE SECURITIZATION. IN ORDER TO PROJECT CASH FLOWS, THE FOLLOWING

ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPLIED TO THE ASSETS UNDERLYING THE SECURITIZATION: (1) VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT RATES, (2) DEFAULT RATES AND (3) LOSS SEVERITY. THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THE

PRIME, ALT-A AND FIRST-LIEN SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENTS

ON

AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, THE COMPANY OBTAINS INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE CARRYING VALUE

OF ALL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE REVIEW FOR

IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERS THE VALUATION FROM THE INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL, WHEN APPLICABLE, AND INCORPORATES AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION

OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS THE

AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.

OTHER

INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR IMPAIRMENT NO

LESS FREQUENTLY THAN QUARTERLY AND MONITORS THE PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MANAGERS/GENERAL PARTNERS. IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF AN IMPAIRMENT OF A PARTNERSHIP'S

INVESTMENTS AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE PARTNERSHIP'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IT WILL RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT BY RECORDING A REDUCTION IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH

A CORRESPONDING CHARGE TO NET INVESTMENT INCOME.

CHANGES

IN INTENT TO SELL TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED ASSETS

THE

COMPANY MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, SELL INVESTED ASSETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE THAT IT DID NOT INTEND TO SELL AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE.

CONVERSELY, THE COMPANY MAY NOT SELL INVESTED ASSETS THAT IT ASSERTED THAT IT INTENDED TO SELL AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. SUCH CHANGES IN INTENT ARE DUE TO EVENTS OCCURRING SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE

SHEET DATE. THE TYPES OF EVENTS THAT MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN INTENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO THE INVESTED ASSET

(E.G., A DOWNGRADE OR UPGRADE FROM A RATING AGENCY), SIGNIFICANT UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN LIQUIDITY NEEDS, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

SECURITIES LENDING

THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES NET INVESTMENT INCOME BY LENDING CERTAIN OF ITS

INVESTMENTS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. BORROWERS OF THESE SECURITIES PROVIDE COLLATERAL EQUAL TO AT LEAST 102% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST.

THIS COLLATERAL IS HELD BY A THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN, AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE COLLATERAL ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THE INSTITUTION BORROWING THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES IS IN DEFAULT UNDER

THE LENDING AGREEMENT. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RECEIPT OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN OR THE OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE COLLATERAL. THE LOANED SECURITIES

REMAIN A RECORDED ASSET OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ACCEPTS ONLY CASH AS COLLATERAL FOR SECURITIES ON LOAN AND RESTRICTS THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT CASH IS INVESTED.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ONGOING REVIEW OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION

PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. AMOUNTS DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE, INCLUDING AMOUNTS DUE FROM KNOWN INSOLVENT

REINSURERS, ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. ANY SUBSEQUENT COLLECTIONS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF ARE REPORTED AS PART OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM

REINSURER INSOLVENCIES.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

INCREMENTAL DIRECT COSTS OF ACQUIRED NEW AND RENEWAL INSURANCE CONTRACTS, CONSISTING OF COMMISSIONS (OTHER THAN CONTINGENT COMMISSIONS)

AND PREMIUM-RELATED TAXES, ARE CAPITALIZED AND CHARGED TO EXPENSE PRO RATA OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS IN WHICH THE RELATED PREMIUMS ARE EARNED. DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS ARE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE IF

THEY ARE RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE INCOME AND, IF NOT, ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. FUTURE INVESTMENT INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RELATED PREMIUMS IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MEASURING THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THIS ASSET. ALL OTHER ACQUISITION EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED.

CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

UNDER CERTAIN WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT FOR THE

FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE POLICYHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. THESE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN

CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES AND CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS A REVIEW, ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, OF GOODWILL HELD BY THE REPORTING UNITS WHICH ARE THE COMPANY'S THREE

OPERATING AND REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: BUSINESS INSURANCE; FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE; AND PERSONAL INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS AND

COMPARES IT TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS WERE TO EXCEED THEIR FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE CALCULATED AND GOODWILL

ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.

THE

COMPANY USES A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL IS AN INCOME APPROACH TO VALUATION THAT IS BASED ON A

DETAILED CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS FOR DERIVING A CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS AND IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTING UNITS' CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS

REFLECT THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE COMPANY'S WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, AND ARE COMPARED AGAINST AVAILABLE MARKET DATA FOR

REASONABLENESS.

OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY THE COMPANY ARE ALSO REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASSET AS INDEFINITE-LIVED IS

REASSESSED AND AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE A FINITE USEFUL LIFE ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A FINITE USEFUL LIFE IS REGULARLY

REVIEWED FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT IN VALUE. IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE FROM ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND IS MEASURED AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

AS

A RESULT OF THE REVIEWS PERFORMED FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THE

RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FOR THOSE YEARS AND THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY ALSO DETERMINED DURING ITS REVIEWS FOR EACH YEAR THAT ITS OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE NOT IMPAIRED.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT ESTIMATES FOR THE ULTIMATE COST OF UNPAID REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CLAIMS

INCURRED AND RELATED EXPENSES. THE RESERVES ARE ADJUSTED REGULARLY BASED UPON EXPERIENCE. INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ARE CERTAIN

RESERVES DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE LIABILITIES FOR LOSSES FOR MOST LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND ANNUITY CLAIM PAYMENTS, PRIMARILY ARISING FROM WORKERS' COMPENSATION

INSURANCE AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE POLICIES,

WERE

DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 5% AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012. THESE DISCOUNTED RESERVES TOTALED $2.21 BILLION AND $2.01 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE

COMPANY PERFORMS A CONTINUING REVIEW OF ITS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, INCLUDING ITS RESERVING TECHNIQUES AND ITS REINSURANCE. THE RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED

REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. SINCE THE RESERVES ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN SUCH RESERVES. THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SUCH

ESTIMATED RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. SUCH CHANGES IN ESTIMATES COULD OCCUR IN A FUTURE PERIOD AND MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN SUCH PERIOD.

OTHER LIABILITIES

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IS THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITY FOR GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER

INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. THE LIABILITY FOR EXPECTED STATE GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER PREMIUM-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE COMPANY WRITES OR BECOMES OBLIGATED TO WRITE OR RENEW THE

PREMIUMS ON WHICH THE ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE BASED. THE LIABILITY FOR LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE RELATED LOSSES ARE INCURRED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, THE COMPANY

HAD A LIABILITY OF $261 MILLION AND $297 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS AND RELATED RECOVERABLES OF $14 MILLION AND

$15 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE LIABILITY FOR SUCH ASSESSMENTS AND THE RELATED RECOVERABLES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED FOR THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. THE LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PAID

OVER A PERIOD RANGING FROM ONE YEAR TO THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF CERTAIN WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMANTS AND THE RECOVERIES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME.

ALSO

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IS AN ACCRUAL FOR POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS. CERTAIN INSURANCE CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY WORKERS' COMPENSATION, ARE PARTICIPATING WHEREBY DIVIDENDS ARE PAID TO

POLICYHOLDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACT PROVISIONS. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR PARTICIPATING DIVIDEND POLICIES WERE APPROXIMATELY 1%, 2% AND 1% OF TOTAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS ARE ACCRUED AGAINST EARNINGS USING BEST AVAILABLE ESTIMATES OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID. THE LIABILITY ACCRUED FOR POLICYHOLDER

DIVIDENDS TOTALED $53 MILLION AND $59 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

TREASURY STOCK

THE COST OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED BY THE COMPANY IS REPORTED AS TREASURY STOCK AND REPRESENTS AUTHORIZED AND UNISSUED SHARES OF THE

COMPANY UNDER THE MINNESOTA BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT.

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, DOMICILED PRINCIPALLY IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT, PREPARE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES PRESCRIBED OR PERMITTED BY THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATES OF DOMICILE. PRESCRIBED STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES ARE THOSE PRACTICES THAT ARE

INCORPORATED DIRECTLY OR BY REFERENCE IN STATE LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ALL INSURANCE ENTERPRISES DOMICILED IN A PARTICULAR STATE. PERMITTED STATUTORY

ACCOUNTING PRACTICES INCLUDE PRACTICES NOT PRESCRIBED BY THE DOMICILIARY STATE, BUT

COMPANY'S NON-U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES FILE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCAL JURISDICTION.

PREMIUMS AND UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES

PREMIUMS ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUES PRO RATA OVER THE POLICY PERIOD. UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES REPRESENT THE UNEXPIRED PORTION OF

POLICY PREMIUMS. ACCRUED RETROSPECTIVE PREMIUMS ARE INCLUDED IN PREMIUM BALANCES RECEIVABLE. PREMIUM BALANCES RECEIVABLE ARE REPORTED NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE PREMIUM AMOUNTS.

CEDED

PREMIUMS ARE CHARGED TO INCOME OVER THE APPLICABLE TERM OF THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTY REINSURERS. PREPAID REINSURANCE PREMIUMS REPRESENT THE UNEXPIRED

PORTION OF PREMIUMS CEDED TO REINSURERS AND ARE REPORTED AS PART OF OTHER ASSETS.

FEE INCOME

FEE INCOME INCLUDES SERVICING FEES FROM CARRIERS AND REVENUES FROM LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES AND SERVICE CONTRACTS AND IS RECOGNIZED

PRO RATA OVER THE CONTRACT OR POLICY PERIODS.

OTHER REVENUES

OTHER REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM PREMIUM INSTALLMENT CHARGES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED AS COLLECTED, REVENUES OF NONINSURANCE

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND TAX RETURN BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, BASED ON ENACTED TAX RATES AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE TAX LAW. THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN TAX LAWS OR RATES

ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGE IS ENACTED. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT ALL OR SOME PORTION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY ASSIGNS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES TO ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY THE CURRENCIES OF THE LOCAL OPERATING

ENVIRONMENT. FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED TO THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, AND THE RESULTING FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS ARE THEN

TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT AND TRANSLATION ARE CALCULATED USING CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES FOR ITEMS REPORTED IN THE BALANCE SHEETS AND AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FOR

ITEMS RECORDED IN EARNINGS. THE CHANGE IN UNREALIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION GAIN OR LOSS DURING THE YEAR, NET OF TAX, IS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK, STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED OR STOCK-DENOMINATED AWARDS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK.

COMPENSATION

COST IS MEASURED BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF AN AWARD, UTILIZING THE ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 13. COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED FOR FINANCIAL

REPORTING PURPOSES OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE AWARD (GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD). IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SHARE-BASED AWARDS,

PARTICIPANTS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, EITHER IN CASH OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT SHARES, COMMENSURATE WITH THE DIVIDENDS PAID TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. DIVIDENDS AND

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT SHARES ON AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO VEST ARE RECORDED IN RETAINED EARNINGS. DIVIDENDS PAID ON AWARDS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VEST AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S FORFEITURE ESTIMATE

ARE RECORDED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED INTO THREE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: BUSINESS INSURANCE; FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL

INSURANCE; AND PERSONAL INSURANCE. THESE SEGMENTS REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES ARE CURRENTLY MANAGED AND REPRESENT AN AGGREGATION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BASED ON TYPE OF

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO U.S. TREASURY NOTE FUTURES CONTRACTS TO MODIFY THE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF SPECIFIC ASSETS

WITHIN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS REQUIRE A DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET AND SETTLEMENT WITH THE BROKER. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, THE COMPANY HAD $0 AND

$800 MILLION NOTIONAL VALUE OF OPEN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS, RESPECTIVELY. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011 INCLUDED NET GAINS OF $115 MILLION, NET LOSSES OF

$14 MILLION AND NET LOSSES OF $62 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS.

THE

COMPANY PURCHASES INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES. THESE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN VALUE

REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS. DERIVATIVES EMBEDDED IN CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES ARE REPORTED ON A COMBINED BASIS WITH THEIR HOST INSTRUMENT AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS FIXED MATURITY

SECURITIES. THE COMPANY

RECORDED

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OF LESS THAN $1 MILLION IN 2013, NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES OF LESS THAN $1 MILLION IN 2012 AND NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES OF

$2 MILLION IN 2011 RELATED TO THESE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE FRAMEWORK IS BASED

ON THE INPUTS USED IN VALUATION, GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND REQUIRES THAT OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED IN THE VALUATIONS WHEN AVAILABLE. THE DISCLOSURE OF FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES IN THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON WHETHER THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE OBSERVABLE. IN DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY IN WHICH THE

ESTIMATE IS DISCLOSED, THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT MARKET

ASSUMPTIONS. THE LEVEL IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WITHIN WHICH THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS REPORTED IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE

THREE LEVELS OF THE HIERARCHY ARE AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1



UNADJUSTED QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS.



LEVEL 2



QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES

IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS; OR VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE (E.G., INTEREST

RATES, YIELD CURVES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, ETC.) OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.



LEVEL 3



VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE SIGNIFICANT

INPUTS ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT THE COMPANY'S OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE INPUTS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE, UNRELATED, WILLING PARTIES, I.E., NOT IN A FORCED TRANSACTION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MAY DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED IF THE

SECURITY WAS SOLD IN AN IMMEDIATE SALE, E.G., A FORCED TRANSACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE LESS LIQUID DUE TO THE LACK OF MARKET BASED

INPUTS, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE PRICE AT WHICH AN ACTUAL TRANSACTION WOULD OCCUR.

FOR

INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, THE COMPANY USES THE UNADJUSTED QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDES THESE PRICES IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN

LEVEL 1 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES FROM A THIRD PARTY, NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICE (PRICING SERVICE). WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE UNAVAILABLE,

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS MAINLY USED FOR ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES PROVIDED FROM THIS PRICING SERVICE ARE

INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND AN ESTIMATE FROM A PRICING SERVICE ARE UNAVAILABLE, THE COMPANY PRODUCES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE

BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, WILL RENDER THE FAIR

198

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)

VALUE

ESTIMATE AS LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3. THE COMPANY BASES ALL OF ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR ASSETS ON THE BID PRICE AS IT REPRESENTS WHAT A THIRD-PARTY MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD BE

WILLING TO PAY IN AN ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION.

FIXED MATURITIES

THE COMPANY UTILIZED A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 98% OF ITS FIXED MATURITIES AT BOTH

DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012. THE PRICING SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. SINCE FIXED MATURITIES OTHER THAN U.S.

TREASURY SECURITIES GENERALLY DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY BASIS, THE PRICING SERVICE PREPARES ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR THESE SECURITIES USING ITS PROPRIETARY PRICING APPLICATIONS, WHICH

INCLUDE AVAILABLE RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, BENCHMARK

CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR GROUPINGS AND MATRIX PRICING. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRICING SERVICE USES AN OPTION ADJUSTED SPREAD MODEL TO DEVELOP PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS.

THE

PRICING SERVICE EVALUATES EACH ASSET CLASS BASED ON RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, RELEVANT CREDIT INFORMATION, PERCEIVED MARKET MOVEMENTS AND SECTOR NEWS. THE MARKET INPUTS UTILIZED

IN THE PRICING EVALUATION, LISTED IN THE APPROXIMATE ORDER OF PRIORITY, INCLUDE: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES, BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, TWO-SIDED MARKETS, BENCHMARK SECURITIES, BIDS,

OFFERS, REFERENCE DATA, AND INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. THE EXTENT OF THE USE OF EACH MARKET INPUT DEPENDS ON THE ASSET CLASS AND THE MARKET CONDITIONS. DEPENDING ON THE SECURITY, THE PRIORITY OF

THE USE OF INPUTS MAY CHANGE OR SOME MARKET INPUTS MAY NOT BE RELEVANT. FOR SOME SECURITIES, ADDITIONAL INPUTS MAY BE NECESSARY.

THE

PRICING SERVICE UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL ONLY PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IF THERE IS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE INFORMATION TO PRODUCE A VALUATION. IF

THE PRICING SERVICE DISCONTINUES PRICING AN INVESTMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE USING SOME OF THE SAME METHODOLOGIES AS THE PRICING SERVICE BUT WOULD HAVE TO

MAKE ASSUMPTIONS FOR MARKET-BASED INPUTS THAT ARE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF MOST FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION RATHER THAN MARKET QUOTES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH FIXED

MATURITIES, OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES IS INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 AS THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON UNADJUSTED MARKET PRICES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HOLDS CERTAIN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE NOT PRICED BY THE PRICING SERVICE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH FIXED MATURITIES USING AN

INTERNAL MATRIX THAT IS BASED ON MARKET INFORMATION REGARDING INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND LIQUIDITY. THE UNDERLYING SOURCE DATA FOR CALCULATING THE MATRIX OF CREDIT SPREADS RELATIVE TO THE U.S.

TREASURY CURVE ARE THE BOFA MERRILL LYNCH U.S. CORPORATE INDEX AND THE BOFA MERRILL LYNCH HIGH YIELD BB RATED INDEX. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF THESE CORPORATE BONDS IN

LEVEL 2, SINCE ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE MARKET OBSERVABLE.

199

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)

WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S MUNICIPAL BONDS AND CORPORATE BONDS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2, THE COMPANY HOLDS A NUMBER OF MUNICIPAL BONDS AND CORPORATE BONDS WHICH ARE

NOT VALUED BY THE PRICING SERVICE AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL PRICING MATRIX WITH SOME UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUATION. DUE TO THE LIMITED

AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THESE PARTICULAR BONDS IN LEVEL 3.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY USED AN INTERNAL PRICING MATRIX WAS $94 MILLION AND $102 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL AMOUNT OF OTHER FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE THEM UNSUITABLE FOR MATRIX PRICING. FOR THESE FIXED MATURITIES, THE COMPANY

OBTAINS A QUOTE FROM A BROKER (PRIMARILY THE MARKET MAKER). THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY RECEIVED A BROKER QUOTE WAS $161 MILLION AND $128 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. DUE TO THE DISCLAIMERS ON THE QUOTES THAT INDICATE THAT THE PRICE IS INDICATIVE ONLY, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN

LEVEL 3.

EQUITIESPUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED

FOR PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS, THE COMPANY RECEIVES PRICES FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICE THAT ARE BASED ON

OBSERVABLE MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND INCLUDES THESE ESTIMATES IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1. WHEN CURRENT MARKET QUOTES IN ACTIVE MARKETS ARE UNAVAILABLE FOR CERTAIN NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED

STOCKS HELD BY THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FROM THE PRICING SERVICE THAT PROVIDES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITIES. THE SERVICE UTILIZES SOME OF

THE SAME METHODOLOGIES TO PRICE THE NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS AS IT DOES FOR THE FIXED MATURITIES. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE FOR THESE NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS IN THE

AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS PUBLICLY-TRADED SECURITIES WHICH ARE REPORTED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS. THESE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE

SECURITIES IN THE COMPANY'S TRADING PORTFOLIO, MUTUAL FUNDS AND OTHER SMALL HOLDINGS. THE $19 MILLION AND $46 MILLION FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND

2012, RESPECTIVELY, WAS DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, THE COMPANY HELD INVESTMENTS IN NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES, WITH FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES

OF $34 MILLION AND $54 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REPORTED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS, WHERE THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE IS DETERMINED EITHER INTERNALLY OR BY AN EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER BASED ON RECENT

FILINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTALS. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN THESE VALUATIONS, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE

TOTAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE FOR ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 3.

DERIVATIVES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, THE COMPANY HELD $8 MILLION AND $21 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF CONVERTIBLE BONDS

CONTAINING EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS THAT ARE VALUED SEPARATELY FROM THE HOST BOND CONTRACT IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2FIXED MATURITIES.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZED A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE FOR APPROXIMATELY 97% AND 95% OF SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. A DESCRIPTION OF

THE PROCESS AND INPUTS USED BY THE PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE IS DISCUSSED IN THE "

FIXED MATURITIES

" SECTION ABOVE. ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE

FOR U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS ARE BASED ON MARKET QUOTATIONS RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE AND ARE DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE FAIR VALUE OF OTHER

SHORT-TERM FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES IS ESTIMATED BY THE PRICING SERVICE USING OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS AND IS DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. FOR SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WHERE AN ESTIMATE

IS NOT OBTAINED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE, THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE AND IS INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE HIERARCHY.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZED A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE FOR 100% OF ITS DEBT, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012. THE PRICING SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET

QUOTATIONS FOR DEBT THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. SINCE FIXED MATURITIES OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES GENERALLY DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY BASIS, THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON

MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY.

THE

COMPANY HAD NO MATERIAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT WERE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

5. REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF ASSUMED AND CEDED REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. ASSUMED REINSURANCE REFERS TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS

THAT OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN. CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES TRANSFERRING CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS (ALONG WITH THE RELATED WRITTEN AND EARNED PREMIUMS) THE COMPANY HAS UNDERWRITTEN TO

OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO AGREE TO SHARE THESE RISKS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF CEDED REINSURANCE IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY, AT A COST, FROM LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT IT IS PREPARED TO ACCEPT.

REINSURANCE IS PLACED ON BOTH A QUOTA-SHARE AND EXCESS-OF-LOSS BASIS. CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT DISCHARGE THE COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY INSURER, EXCEPT FOR INSTANCES WHERE THE PRIMARY POLICY

OR POLICIES HAVE BEEN NOVATED.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATIES WITH UNAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO HELP MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES. IN ADDITION TO THE COVERAGE

PROVIDED UNDER THESE TREATIES, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES CATASTROPHE BONDS AND A NORTHEAST CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY TO PROTECT AGAINST LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES IN THE NORTHEASTERN

UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES EXCESS-OF-LOSS TREATIES TO PROTECT AGAINST EARTHQUAKE LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN THRESHOLD IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT (FOR CERTAIN MARKETS) AND FOR THE

PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT.

THE

COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER

INSOLVENCIES. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND

ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO DETERMINE THE COMPANY'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND STRATEGIES

TO MANAGE REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE AMOUNTS RELATED TO INVOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS

THROUGH ASSUMED REINSURANCE, PRINCIPALLY WITH REGARD TO RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS IN WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND

AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, AS WELL AS HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE IN CERTAIN COASTAL AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PROVIDES SERVICES FOR SEVERAL OF THESE INVOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS (MANDATORY POOLS AND

ASSOCIATIONS) UNDER WHICH IT WRITES SUCH RESIDUAL MARKET BUSINESS DIRECTLY, THEN CEDES 100% OF THIS BUSINESS TO THE MANDATORY POOL. SUCH PARTICIPATIONS AND SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ARRANGED TO

MITIGATE CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY, AS ANY CEDED BALANCES ARE JOINTLY BACKED BY ALL THE POOL MEMBERS.

ALSO

INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS ARE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SETTLE

CERTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE THE COMPANY DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE STRUCTURED

SETTLEMENT IS INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED CLAIM COST IS INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, AS THE COMPANY RETAINS THE CONTINGENT

LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IF IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PAY, THE COMPANY WOULD RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF THE RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE IF, AND TO THE EXTENT,

THE PURCHASED ANNUITIES ARE NOT COVERED BY STATE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE

SUCH PAYMENTS.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM

THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY THAT PROVIDES FOR A SYSTEM OF

SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE CURRENT PROGRAM HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED THROUGH 2014. SEVERAL BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED

IN CONGRESS TO EXTEND THE CURRENT PROGRAM BEYOND DECEMBER 31, 2014.

IN

ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS AND MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS

AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, IN CONCURRENCE WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE

206

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

5. REINSURANCE (CONTINUED)

ATTORNEY

GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. THE ANNUAL AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUM IS $100 MILLION THROUGH 2014. THE PROGRAM EXCLUDES FROM PARTICIPATION THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE: FEDERAL

CROP INSURANCE, PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE, HEALTH OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD INSURANCE, REINSURANCE, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, PROFESSIONAL

LIABILITY (OTHER THAN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS'), SURETY, BURGLARY AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS MULTI-PERIL. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS' COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE

PROGRAM. ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER, IN EXCHANGE FOR

MAKING TERRORISM INSURANCE AVAILABLE, IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR 85% OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP.

THE

DEDUCTIBLE FOR ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS EQUAL TO 20% OF THE INSURER'S DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS FOR COVERED LINES FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER

THE PROGRAM IS $2.35 BILLION FOR 2014. THE ANNUAL CAP LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE

$100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, PARTICIPATING INSURERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM FOR ADDITIONAL COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES FOR THAT PROGRAM YEAR. THERE HAVE BEEN NO

TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES THAT HAVE TRIGGERED PROGRAM COVERAGE SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED. SINCE THE LAW IS UNTESTED, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW IT WILL BE APPLIED IF AN ACT OF

TERRORISM IS CERTIFIED UNDER THE PROGRAM. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ACTION COULD CHANGE THE PROGRAM. FURTHER, GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM LOSSES, AS

WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN THE COMPANY'S OWN REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS,

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING

FROM A HIGH FREQUENCY OF HIGH SEVERITY NATURAL CATASTROPHES AND/OR OF MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL MEANS. WHILE THE COMPANY SEEKS TO MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL MEANS, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ONE OR MORE MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS

INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL MEANS.

WITH THE MERGER OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. AND TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. IN 2004, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF NOMINAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE METHOD USED CALCULATED A RISK ADJUSTMENT TO A RISK-FREE DISCOUNTED RESERVE THAT WOULD, IF RESERVES RAN OFF AS EXPECTED, PRODUCE RESULTS

THAT YIELDED THE ASSUMED COST-OF-CAPITAL ON THE CAPITAL SUPPORTING THE LOSS RESERVES. THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AND THE

AMOUNTS MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACQUIRER'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS PART OF THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES. THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE BEING RECOGNIZED INTO INCOME OVER THE EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERN. BECAUSE THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND THE RISK ADJUSTMENT (COST OF CAPITAL) COMPONENTS OF THE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS RUN OFF AT DIFFERENT RATES, THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN INCOME MAY BE A NET BENEFIT IN SOME PERIODS AND A NET EXPENSE IN OTHER PERIODS. ADDITIONALLY, $5 MILLION OF

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2011 WAS $245 MILLION, PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE (EXCLUDING INCREASES TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES DISCUSSED BELOW) WHICH WAS CONCENTRATED IN EXCESS

COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2008 AND REFLECTED WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE MORE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS THAN WHAT THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED, AS WELL AS NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE THAT REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR THE 2008 AND 2009 ACCIDENT YEARS. THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION

LINE OF BUSINESS ALSO CONTRIBUTED SLIGHTLY TO NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2011, AS FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2003 THROUGH 2009 WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY NET

UNFAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR THE 2010 ACCIDENT YEAR. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2011 WAS REDUCED BY $175 MILLION AND $76 MILLION INCREASES TO ASBESTOS AND

IT

IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS DUE TO THE VAGARIES OF COURT COVERAGE DECISIONS, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, THE

RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE WHICH ARE SET FORTH BELOW.

ASBESTOS RESERVES.

BECAUSE EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE

EXPOSURE PRESENTED

BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AT LEAST ANNUALLY. AMONG THE FACTORS WHICH THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER IN THE COURSE OF THIS REVIEW ARE: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS

INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM

ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS

CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A

PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM.

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IN-DEPTH ASBESTOS CLAIM REVIEW, INCLUDING A REVIEW OF ACTIVE POLICYHOLDERS AND LITIGATION CASES FOR POTENTIAL PRODUCT AND

"NON-PRODUCT" LIABILITY, AND NOTED THE CONTINUATION OF THE FOLLOWING TRENDS.



CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS INVOLVING INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS

ASBESTOS-RELATED ILLNESS;



WHILE OVERALL PAYMENT PATTERNS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY STABLE, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN SEVERITY FOR CERTAIN

POLICYHOLDERS DUE TO THE CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY;



CONTINUED MODERATE LEVEL OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCY ACTIVITY; AND



THE ABSENCE OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR NEW CLASSES OF DEFENDANTS.

WHILE

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REDUCTION IN THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S OVERALL ASBESTOS EXPOSURE, THERE NONETHELESS

REMAINS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE FROM ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

THE

HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE CATEGORIES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICYHOLDERS WITH ACTIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS, EXPERIENCED A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS WITH OPEN ASBESTOS CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2012, WHILE NET ASBESTOS-RELATED PAYMENTS IN THESE CATEGORIES DECREASED SLIGHTLY IN 2013 COMPARED

WITH 2012. PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF POLICYHOLDERS IN THESE CATEGORIES CONTINUE TO BE INFLUENCED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WHERE INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING

SERIOUS ASBESTOS-RELATED INJURY CONTINUE TO TARGET DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION.

THE

COMPANY'S QUARTERLY ASBESTOS RESERVE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANALYZES DEVELOPING PAYMENT PATTERNS AMONG POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE, FIELD OFFICE AND ASSUMED REINSURANCE AND OTHER

CATEGORIES AS WELL AS PROJECTED REINSURANCE BILLINGS AND RECOVERIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE, YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY

EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES NOR HAVE THE COMPANY'S

EVALUATIONS RESULTED IN ANY WAY OF DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY PAYMENT.

THE COMPLETION OF THESE REVIEWS AND ANALYSES IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011 RESULTED IN $190 MILLION, $175 MILLION AND $175 MILLION INCREASES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE COMPANY'S

NET ASBESTOS RESERVES IN EACH PERIOD. IN EACH YEAR, THE RESERVE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF PROJECTED SETTLEMENT AND DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO A BROAD

NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE CATEGORY AND BY HIGHER PROJECTED PAYMENTS ON ASSUMED REINSURANCE ACCOUNTS. THE

INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATE OF PROJECTED SETTLEMENT AND DEFENSE COSTS RESULTED FROM PAYMENT TRENDS THAT CONTINUE TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT

LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT DISCUSSED ABOVE. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE TRENDS, THE COMPANY'S OVERALL VIEW OF THE UNDERLYING ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM RECENT PERIODS, AND THERE REMAINS

A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

NET

ASBESTOS LOSSES PAID IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011 WERE $218 MILLION, $236 MILLION AND $284 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. APPROXIMATELY 1%, 6% AND 19% OF TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES

IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANY'S LIABILITY.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

IN ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND

THE ANTICIPATED

COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF

SIMILAR EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS: THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL

NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH

SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE

COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION. THE EVALUATION OF THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY A POLICYHOLDER CAN CHANGE AS

INFORMATION CONCERNING THAT POLICYHOLDER AND THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED IS DEVELOPED. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE NOTICES FROM POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME, FREQUENTLY UNDER POLICIES ISSUED PRIOR TO THE MID-1980'S. THESE POLICYHOLDERS CONTINUE TO

PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE LOWER TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, IN MANY INSTANCES, CLEAN-UP COSTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT RISK-BASED

SITE ANALYSES AND MORE EFFICIENT CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED GENERALLY FAVORABLE TRENDS IN THE NUMBER OF NEW POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IN THE NUMBER OF PENDING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. HOWEVER, THE DEGREE TO WHICH THOSE FAVORABLE TRENDS HAVE CONTINUED HAS BEEN LESS

THAN ANTICIPATED. IN ADDITION, RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS HAS BEEN GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED. AS A RESULT, IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS NET ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES BY $65 MILLION, $90 MILLION AND $76 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DISCUSSED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES

CARRIED FOR

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND

215

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)

MANAGEMENT'S

JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR

DECREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE, AND/OR THE NUMBER OF, ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED, THE EMERGENCE OF A GREATER NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS THAN ANTICIPATED AS A

RESULT OF EXTENDED LIFE EXPECTANCIES RESULTING FROM MEDICAL ADVANCES AND LIFESTYLE IMPROVEMENTS, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF

DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF

DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE

SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS. IN ADDITION, UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM THE

INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS ENVIRONMENT COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION AND FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE

OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR JUDICIAL REFORMS ESTABLISHING MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX

COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE

WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE

THE COMPANY HAS GEOGRAPHIC EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BY A VARIETY OF EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

HURRICANES, TORNADOES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS,

EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO RESULT FROM A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL,

CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS), EXPLOSIONS, INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES OR AS A CONSEQUENCE OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT

OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS; HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO MITIGATE ITS EXPOSURE

TO CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE.

216

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)

THERE

ARE ALSO RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY OF THE

COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION

AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION

EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, INCLUDING HIGHER FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS;

INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS INCOME INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END

OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

DESCRIPTION OF DEBT

COMMERCIAL PAPER

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN $800 MILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, SUPPORTED BY A $1.0 BILLION BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT

EXPIRES ON JUNE 7, 2018. (SEE "CREDIT AGREEMENT" DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS). INTEREST RATES ON COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED IN 2013 RANGED FROM 0.08% TO 0.13%, AND IN 2012 RANGED FROM 0.08% TO 0.17%.

SENIOR NOTES

THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS SENIOR DEBT ISSUES ARE UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS THAT RANK EQUALLY WITH ONE ANOTHER. INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE MADE

SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE COMPANY GENERALLY MAY REDEEM SOME OR ALL OF THE NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH TERMS UNIQUE TO EACH DEBT INSTRUMENT.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

THE COMPANY'S $107 MILLION REMAINING AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.25% FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE DEBENTURES BEAR

INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 6.25% FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE TO, BUT EXCLUDING, MARCH 15, 2017, PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON MARCH 15 AND SEPTEMBER 15. FROM AND INCLUDING

MARCH 15, 2017, THE DEBENTURES WILL BEAR INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 2.215%, PAYABLE QUARTERLY ON MARCH 15, JUNE 15, SEPTEMBER 15 AND

DECEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2017 AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT BEING REDEEMED PLUS ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2017 (A) IN WHOLE AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME

OR (B) IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN TAX OR RATING AGENCY EVENTS RELATING TO THE DEBENTURES, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT

BEING REDEEMED AND THE APPLICABLE MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT, IN EACH CASE PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST.

THE

COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT, ON ONE OR MORE OCCASIONS, TO DEFER THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE DEBENTURES. THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE DEFERRED INTEREST UNTIL IT HAS

DEFERRED INTEREST

FOR

FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OR, IF EARLIER, MADE A PAYMENT OF CURRENT INTEREST DURING A DEFERRAL PERIOD. THE COMPANY MAY DEFER INTEREST FOR UP TO TEN CONSECUTIVE YEARS WITHOUT GIVING RISE TO AN EVENT

OF DEFAULT. DEFERRED INTEREST WILL ACCUMULATE ADDITIONAL INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE EQUAL TO THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE THEN APPLICABLE TO THE DEBENTURES.

THE

DEBENTURES HAVE A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 15, 2067 AND A SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 15, 2037. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION ANY TIME

(AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) USING ANY SOURCE OF FUNDS, INCLUDING CASH. IF THE COMPANY CHOOSES NOT TO REDEEM THE DEBENTURES, THEN DURING THE 180-DAY PERIOD ENDING NOT MORE THAN 15 AND NOT LESS THAN TEN

BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO SELL ENOUGH QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES TO PERMIT REPAYMENT OF THE

DEBENTURES AT THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE. IF ANY DEBENTURES REMAIN OUTSTANDING AFTER THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, UNLESS AND UNTIL THE COMPANY REDEEMS THE DEBENTURES (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) USING ANY

SOURCE OF FUNDS, INCLUDING CASH, THE COMPANY SHALL BE REQUIRED TO USE ITS COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO RAISE SUFFICIENT PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF QUALIFYING CAPITAL

SECURITIES TO PERMIT THE REPAYMENT IN FULL OF THE DEBENTURES. IF THERE ARE REMAINING DEBENTURES AT THE FINAL MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO REDEEM THE DEBENTURES USING ANY SOURCE OF FUNDS.

QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES ARE SECURITIES (OTHER THAN COMMON STOCK, QUALIFYING WARRANTS, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON EQUITY, AND DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR

PREFERRED EQUITY) WHICH GENERALLY ARE TREATED BY THE RATINGS AGENCIES AS HAVING SIMILAR EQUITY CONTENT TO THE DEBENTURES.

THE

COMPANY'S THREE OTHER JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALL SIMILAR IN NATURE TO EACH OTHER. THREE SEPARATE BUSINESS TRUSTS ISSUED PREFERRED SECURITIES TO INVESTORS AND

USED THE PROCEEDS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES. INTEREST ON EACH OF THE INSTRUMENTS IS PAID SEMI-ANNUALLY.

THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDES THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, WHICH WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE RESULTING FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING THE EFFECTIVE-INTEREST METHOD. THE AMORTIZATION OF THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT REDUCED INTEREST EXPENSE BY

$1 MILLION FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012.

MATURITIES

THE AMOUNT OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OTHER THAN COMMERCIAL PAPER, THAT BECOME

DUE IN EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IS AS FOLLOWS: 2014, NONE; 2015, $400 MILLION; 2016, $400 MILLION; 2017, $450 MILLION; AND 2018, $500 MILLION.

CREDIT AGREEMENT

ON JUNE 7, 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FIVE-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, REPLACING ITS THREE-YEAR $1.0 BILLION CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT WAS DUE TO EXPIRE ON JUNE 10, 2013. PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT COVENANTS, THE COMPANY MUST

MAINTAIN A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH, DEFINED AS SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP PLUS (A) TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES (NOT TO EXCEED 15% OF TOTAL CAPITAL) AND

(B) MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES (COMBINED WITH TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, NOT TO EXCEED 25% OF TOTAL CAPITAL) LESS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THAT THRESHOLD IS ADJUSTED

DOWNWARD BY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 70% OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED BY THE COMPANY AFTER MARCH 31, 2013, UP TO A MAXIMUM DEDUCTION OF $1.75 BILLION. THE THRESHOLD WAS

$14.01 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND COULD DECLINE TO A MINIMUM OF $13.73 BILLION DURING THE TERM OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY REPURCHASING AN ADDITIONAL

$400 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS OTHER CUSTOMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO A

CHANGE IN CONTROL, WHICH IS DEFINED TO INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF 35% OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S VOTING STOCK AND CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. GENERALLY, THE COST OF BORROWING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL RANGE FROM LIBOR PLUS 87.5 BASIS POINTS TO LIBOR PLUS 150 BASIS

POINTS, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THAT COST WOULD HAVE BEEN LIBOR PLUS 112.5 BASIS POINTS, HAD THERE BEEN ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT

AGREEMENT. THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO SUPPORTS THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.

SHELF REGISTRATION

IN JUNE 2013, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE POTENTIAL

OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES TO REPLACE THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT HAD EXPIRED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY MAY OFFER THESE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT

PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF OFFERING.

9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

AUTHORIZED SHARES

THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF THE COMPANY IS 1.755 BILLION, CONSISTING OF FIVE MILLION OF PREFERRED STOCK,

1.745 BILLION SHARES OF VOTING COMMON STOCK AND FIVE MILLION UNDESIGNATED SHARES. THE COMPANY'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AUTHORIZE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ESTABLISH, FROM THE UNDESIGNATED

SHARES, ONE OR MORE CLASSES AND SERIES OF SHARES, AND TO FURTHER DESIGNATE THE TYPE OF SHARES AND TERMS THEREOF.

PREFERRED STOCK

IN MAY 2013, THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS VOTED TO AMEND THE COMPANY'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO PROVIDE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE UP TO FIVE

MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK.

9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY (CONTINUED)

SUBSEQUENT

TO THIS AMENDMENT OF THE COMPANY'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, THE COMPANY FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IN JUNE 2013 PURSUANT TO WHICH IT

MAY PUBLICLY SELL SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE NEW PREFERRED STOCK, FROM TIME TO TIME. THE NEW SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT REPLACED THE COMPANY'S PRIOR SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

IN

MAY 2011, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REDEMPTION OF THE COMPANY'S PREFERRED STOCK HELD BY THE TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE SAVINGS PLAN) AND GAVE NOTICE OF

THAT REDEMPTION TO THE APPROPRIATE FIDUCIARIES OF THE SAVINGS PLAN. FOLLOWING A FIDUCIARY REVIEW, THE SAVINGS PLAN EXERCISED ITS RIGHT TO CONVERT EACH PREFERRED SHARE INTO EIGHT SHARES OF THE

COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT, ALL PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING ON JUNE 7, 2011 (190,083 SHARES) WERE CONVERTED INTO A TOTAL OF 1.52 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK.

COMMON STOCK

THE COMPANY IS GOVERNED BY THE MINNESOTA BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT. ALL AUTHORIZED SHARES OF VOTING COMMON STOCK HAVE NO PAR VALUE.

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REACQUIRED ARE CONSIDERED AUTHORIZED AND UNISSUED SHARES.

TREASURY STOCK

THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATIONS UNDER WHICH REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO

TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET, PURSUANT TO PRE-SET TRADING PLANS MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 10B5-1 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. THE

AUTHORIZATIONS DO NOT HAVE A STATED EXPIRATION DATE. THE TIMING AND ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

POSITION, EARNINGS, SHARE PRICE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES, MAINTAINING CAPITAL LEVELS COMMENSURATE WITH THE COMPANY'S DESIRED RATINGS FROM INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, FUNDING OF THE COMPANY'S QUALIFIED

PENSION PLAN, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, OTHER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED

FINANCINGS), MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. IN OCTOBER 2013, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION THAT ADDED AN ADDITIONAL $5.0 BILLION OF REPURCHASE CAPACITY.

THE

COMPANY'S AMENDED AND RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN PROVIDES SETTLEMENT ALTERNATIVES TO EMPLOYEES IN WHICH THE COMPANY RETAINS SHARES TO COVER TAX WITHHOLDING COSTS AND EXERCISE

COMMON

SHARES ACQUIRED ARE REPORTED AS TREASURY STOCK IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, DOMICILED PRINCIPALLY IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT, ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY

RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO BE PAID BY EACH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY TO ITS RESPECTIVE PARENT COMPANY WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. A

MAXIMUM OF $3.33 BILLION IS AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2014 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS TO THE HOLDING COMPANY, TRV, WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE

TO ACCELERATE THE TIMING WITHIN 2014 AND/OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2014, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CERTAIN DIVIDENDS BEING SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE

CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.

TRV

IS NOT DEPENDENT ON DIVIDENDS OR OTHER FORMS OF REPATRIATION FROM ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN

OPERATIONS ARE NOT MATERIAL AND ARE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE OPERATIONS.

TRV

AND ITS TWO NON-INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES RECEIVED $2.90 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS IN 2013, ALL OF WHICH WERE RECEIVED FROM THEIR U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.

STATUTORY NET INCOME AND POLICYHOLDER SURPLUS

STATUTORY NET INCOME OF THE COMPANY'S DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WAS $4.18 BILLION, $2.84 BILLION

AND $1.50 BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. POLICYHOLDER SURPLUS OF THE COMPANY'S DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WAS

$21.12 BILLION AND $20.05 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

IF

THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT ANY OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT RESULT IN FUTURE TAX BENEFITS, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE MUST BE ESTABLISHED FOR THE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS THAT ARE

NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED. BASED UPON A REVIEW OF THE COMPANY'S ANTICIPATED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND ALSO INCLUDING ALL OTHER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, THE COMPANY'S

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED.

FOR

TAX RETURN PURPOSES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE COMPANY HAD NET OPERATING LOSS (NOL) CARRYFORWARDS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND UNITED KINGDOM. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF

REALIZING THE BENEFITS OF NOL CARRYFORWARDS DEPEND ON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY TAX LAWS. THE BENEFITS OF THE NOL CARRYFORWARDS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE NOL AMOUNTS BY JURISDICTION AND YEAR OF EXPIRATION ARE AS FOLLOWS.

IN THE BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012 WERE $2 MILLION AND $3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT

THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE BALANCES AT THOSE DATES WERE $19 MILLION AND $21 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF TAX POSITIONS FOR WHICH THE ULTIMATE DEDUCTIBILITY IS

CERTAIN, BUT FOR WHICH THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING OF DEDUCTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF SUCH DEDUCTIBILITY WOULD NOT AFFECT THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES, IF ANY, RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN INCOME TAXES. DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZED APPROXIMATELY $(67) MILLION AND $46 MILLION IN INTEREST, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION AND $94 MILLION ACCRUED FOR THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

IRS IS CONDUCTING AN EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2011 AND 2012. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ITS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

13. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS A SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN, THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED (THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN),

WHICH REPLACED PRIOR SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS (LEGACY PLANS). THE PURPOSES OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN ARE TO ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY'S NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES WITH THOSE OF THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS, AND TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN PERSONNEL BY PROVIDING INCENTIVES IN THE FORM OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN PERMITS

GRANTS OF NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND OTHER

STOCK-BASED OR STOCK-DENOMINATED AWARDS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZED FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN IS

35 MILLION SHARES, SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY OF ISSUING NEW SHARES TO SETTLE THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTION AWARDS

AND THE VESTING OF OTHER EQUITY AWARDS. THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN EXPIRES IN JULY 2014. THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED A NEW SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN TO REPLACE THE

EXPIRING PLAN HAVING SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS (OTHER THAN THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE) AS THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN WHICH WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AT THE COMPANY'S 2014 ANNUAL

MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, LEGACY SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS WERE TERMINATED. OUTSTANDING GRANTS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE TERMINATION OF

THESE

LEGACY

PLANS, INCLUDING THE GRANT OF RELOAD OPTIONS RELATED TO PRIOR OPTION GRANTS UNDER THE LEGACY PLANS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY OPTIONS ELIGIBLE FOR RELOAD.

THE

2004 INCENTIVE PLAN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED. IN ADDITION TO THE 35 MILLION SHARES INITIALLY AUTHORIZED FOR

ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE COUNTED TOWARDS THE 35 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN.

(I) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO AN AWARD THAT EXPIRES UNEXERCISED, THAT IS FORFEITED, TERMINATED OR CANCELED, THAT IS SETTLED IN CASH OR OTHER FORMS OF PROPERTY, OR OTHERWISE DOES NOT

RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, IN WHOLE OR IN PART; (II) SHARES THAT ARE USED TO PAY THE EXERCISE PRICE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SHARES USED TO PAY WITHHOLDING TAXES ON AWARDS

GENERALLY; AND (III) SHARES PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ON THE OPEN MARKET USING CASH OPTION EXERCISE PROCEEDS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

AVAILABLE FOR GRANT PURSUANT TO SUCH MARKET PURCHASES SHALL NOT BE GREATER THAN THE NUMBER THAT COULD BE REPURCHASED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF EXERCISE OF THE STOCK OPTION GIVING RISE TO

SUCH OPTION PROCEEDS. THESE PROVISIONS ALSO APPLY TO AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE LEGACY SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS A COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS (THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM). UNDER THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION

CONSISTS OF AN ANNUAL RETAINER, A DEFERRED STOCK AWARD, COMMITTEE CHAIR FEES AND A LEAD DIRECTOR FEE. EACH NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR MAY CHOOSE TO RECEIVE ALL OR A PORTION OF HIS OR HER ANNUAL RETAINER IN

THE FORM OF CASH OR DEFERRED STOCK UNITS WHICH VEST UPON GRANT. THE ANNUAL DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS VEST IN FULL ONE DAY PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OCCURRING IN THE

YEAR FOLLOWING THE YEAR OF THE GRANT DATE, SUBJECT TO CONTINUED SERVICE. THE DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS MAY ACCUMULATE, INCLUDING REINVESTMENT DIVIDENDS, UNTIL DISTRIBUTION EITHER IN A LUMP SUM SIX MONTHS

AFTER TERMINATION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR OR, IF THE DIRECTOR SO ELECTS, IN ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS BEGINNING AT LEAST SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR. THE SHARES OF DEFERRED

STOCK UNITS ISSUED UNDER THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM ARE AWARDED UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN.

STOCK OPTION AWARDS

STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES HAVE A TEN-YEAR TERM. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2007, STOCK OPTIONS

WERE GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY PRECEDING THE DATE OF GRANT. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2007, ALL STOCK OPTIONS ARE GRANTED

WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED GENERALLY VEST UPON MEETING CERTAIN YEARS OF SERVICE CRITERIA. EXCEPT AS

THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD MAY ALLOW IN THE

FUTURE, STOCK OPTIONS CANNOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY THE PARTICIPANT. THE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN VEST THREE YEARS AFTER GRANT DATE (CLIFF VEST).

IN

ADDITION TO THE STOCK OPTION AWARDS DESCRIBED ABOVE, CERTAIN STOCK OPTION AWARDS THAT WERE GRANTED UNDER LEGACY PLANS PERMITTED AN EMPLOYEE EXERCISING AN OPTION TO BE GRANTED A NEW

OPTION (A RELOAD OPTION) AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE ON WHICH THE ORIGINAL OPTION WAS EXERCISED. THE RELOAD OPTION WAS PERMITTED ON

CERTAIN STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2003 AT AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE

COMMON

STOCK USED TO SATISFY BOTH THE EXERCISE PRICE AND WITHHOLDING TAXES DUE UPON EXERCISE OF AN OPTION AND VEST EITHER SIX MONTHS OR ONE YEAR AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE

REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED ORIGINAL OPTION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY OPTIONS ELIGIBLE FOR RELOAD.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT BY APPLICATION OF A VARIATION OF THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL USING THE ASSUMPTIONS NOTED IN THE FOLLOWING

TABLE. THE EXPECTED TERM OF NEWLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS IS THE TIME TO VEST PLUS HALF THE REMAINING TIME TO EXPIRATION. THIS CONSIDERS THE VESTING RESTRICTION AND REPRESENTS AN EVEN PATTERN OF

EXERCISE BEHAVIOR OVER THE REMAINING TERM. RELOAD OPTIONS WERE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE ORIGINAL OPTION AND THEREFORE GENERALLY HAD A SHORTER EXPECTED TERM. BEGINNING IN APRIL 2010,

DUE TO THE COMPANY HAVING ATTAINED SUFFICIENT HISTORY WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES IN ITS STOCK PRICES OVER TIME, THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S

COMMON STOCK FOR THE SAME PERIOD AS THE ESTIMATED OPTION TERM BASED ON THE MID-MONTH OF THE OPTION GRANT. PRIOR TO APRIL 2010, THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY WAS BASED ON THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF

THE COMMON STOCK OF AN INDUSTRY PEER GROUP OF ENTITIES DUE TO THE LIMITED COMPANY STOCK HISTORY. THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S CURRENT QUARTER DIVIDEND ANNUALIZED AND ASSUMED TO BE

CONSTANT OVER THE EXPECTED OPTION TERM. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE FOR EACH OPTION IS THE INTERPOLATED MARKET YIELD FOR THE MID-MONTH OF THE OPTION GRANT ON A U.S. TREASURY BILL WITH A TERM

COMPARABLE TO THE EXPECTED OPTION TERM OF THE GRANTED STOCK OPTION. SHARES RECEIVED THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES UNDER THE RELOAD PROGRAM WERE SUBJECT TO EITHER A ONE-YEAR OR TWO-YEAR RESTRICTION ON SALE.

A DISCOUNT, AS MEASURED BY THE ESTIMATED COST OF PROTECTING AGAINST CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE - 5% FOR ONE-YEAR SALES RESTRICTIONS AND 10% FOR TWO-YEAR SALES RESTRICTIONS - HAD BEEN APPLIED TO THE FAIR

VALUE OF RELOAD OPTIONS GRANTED TO REFLECT THESE SALES RESTRICTIONS. THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS ON GRANT DATE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2013, 2012 AND 2011.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD PROGRAMS

THE COMPANY ISSUES RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES UNDER THE EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED

PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN. A RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT REPRESENTS THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS ARE GRANTED AT MARKET PRICE, GENERALLY VEST

THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, DO NOT HAVE VOTING RIGHTS AND THE UNDERLYING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE NOT ISSUED UNTIL THE VESTING CRITERIA IS SATISFIED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF

DIRECTORS CAN BE ISSUED DEFERRED STOCK UNIT AWARDS FROM (I) AN ANNUAL AWARD; (II) DEFERRED COMPENSATION (IN LIEU OF CASH RETAINER); AND (III) DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT SHARES EARNED

ON OUTSTANDING DEFERRED COMPENSATION.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS A PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS PROGRAM PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE BEGINNING IN 2006. UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE PERFORMANCE

SHARE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF VICE PRESIDENT (OR ITS EQUIVALENT) OR ABOVE. THE PERFORMANCE AWARDS PROVIDE THE RECIPIENT THE RIGHT TO EARN SHARES OF THE

COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ATTAINMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE GOALS. THE PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR PERFORMANCE AWARDS ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ADJUSTED RETURN ON EQUITY OVER A

THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. VESTING OF ANY PERFORMANCE SHARES IS CONTINGENT UPON THE COMPANY ATTAINING THE RELEVANT PERFORMANCE PERIOD MINIMUM THRESHOLD RETURN ON EQUITY. IF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD

RETURN ON EQUITY IS BELOW THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD, NONE OF THE SHARES WILL VEST. IF PERFORMANCE MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE THRESHOLD, A RANGE OF PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL VEST

(50%150% FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN FEBRUARY 2010, 50%130% FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN FEBRUARY 2011, 2012 AND 2013; AND 50%150% FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN 2014); DEPENDING ON

THE ACTUAL RETURN ON EQUITY ATTAINED.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES IS MEASURED AT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY STOCK AT DATE OF GRANT.

THE

TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF SHARES THAT VESTED DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011 WAS $151 MILLION, $146 MILLION AND $121 MILLION,

ON

FEBRUARY 4, 2014, THE COMPANY, UNDER THE 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, GRANTED 1,334,775 COMMON STOCK AWARDS IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND

PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS TO PARTICIPATING OFFICERS, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND DEFERRED STOCK UNITS TOTALED 739,874 SHARES WHILE THE PERFORMANCE

SHARE AWARDS TOTALED 594,901 SHARES. THE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMMON STOCK AWARDS ON THE DATE OF GRANT WAS $80.35.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST RECOGNITION

THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A SERVICE CONDITION IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED AND IS

RECOGNIZED OVER THE TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH SERVICE IS TO BE PROVIDED (REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD). AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREE-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OR TO EMPLOYEES WHO BECOME RETIREE-ELIGIBLE BEFORE AN

AWARD'S VESTING DATE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE MET THE REQUISITE SERVICE CONDITION. THE COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A PERFORMANCE CONDITION IS BASED UPON THE PROBABLE OUTCOME OF THE

PERFORMANCE CONDITION, WHICH ON THE GRANT DATE REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF ATTAINING 100% OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED. THE COMPENSATION COST REFLECTS AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL FORFEITURE RATE FROM 3.0% TO

4.5% OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARDS. THAT ESTIMATE IS REVISED IF SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS EXPECTED TO VEST IS LIKELY TO DIFFER FROM

PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. COMPENSATION COSTS FOR AWARDS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. FOR AWARDS THAT HAVE A GRADED VESTING SCHEDULE, THE COMPENSATION COST IS

RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD FOR EACH SEPARATE VESTING PORTION OF THE AWARD AS IF THE AWARD WAS, IN SUBSTANCE, MULTIPLE AWARDS. THE TOTAL COMPENSATION COST FOR

ALL SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011 WAS $129 MILLION, $120 MILLION AND $121 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS ARE COMPENSATION COST ADJUSTMENTS OF $8 MILLION, $4 MILLION AND $4 MILLION, FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011,

RESPECTIVELY, THAT REFLECTED THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPDATED ESTIMATE OF PERFORMANCE SHARES DUE TO ATTAINING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE LEVELS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL GRANT OF THE PERFORMANCE

AWARDS. THE RELATED TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WERE $45 MILLION, $42 MILLION AND $42 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013, THERE WAS $120 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO ALL NONVESTED SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS. THIS INCLUDES STOCK

OPTIONS, RESTRICTED AND DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN. THE UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE

PERIOD OF 1.7 YEARS.

CASH

RECEIVED FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS UNDER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS TOTALED $206 MILLION AND $295 MILLION IN 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX

BENEFIT REALIZED FOR TAX DEDUCTIONS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2013 AND 2012 TOTALED $42 MILLION AND $36 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2013, THE COMPANY CONVERTED ITS CURRENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES TO A GROUP-BASED COMPANY-SPONSORED MEDICARE PART D

EMPLOYER GROUP WAIVER PLAN (EGWP) PROGRAM. THE EGWP STRUCTURE WAS MADE FINANCIALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR COMPANIES DUE TO CHANGES STEMMING FROM HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION. UNDER EGWP, THE FEDERAL DIRECT

CAPITATION PAYMENTS WILL BE PAID TO THE COMPANY, WHILE THE FEDERAL REINSURANCE AND PHARMACEUTICAL REBATES WILL BE USED TO OFFSET CLAIMS. DUE TO THE TRANSITION TO EGWP, THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS

PRESCRIPTION DRUG LIABILITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 BY APPROXIMATELY $31 MILLION.

THE

TOTAL ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR THE COMPANY'S DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS WAS $3.05 BILLION AND $3.21 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012,

RESPECTIVELY. THE QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PLAN ACCOUNTED FOR $2.85 BILLION AND $3.01 BILLION OF THE TOTAL ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY,

WHEREAS THE NONQUALIFIED AND FOREIGN PLANS ACCOUNTED FOR $0.20 BILLION OF THE TOTAL ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012.

FOR

PENSION PLANS WITH AN ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION IN EXCESS OF PLAN ASSETS, THE AGGREGATE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS $123 MILLION AND $3.25 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE AGGREGATE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS $121 MILLION AND $3.20 BILLION AT

THE

COMPANY HAS DISCRETION REGARDING WHETHER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND WHEN TO PROVIDE SUCH FUNDING TO ITS QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN. IN 2013, THERE WERE NO REQUIRED

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN, AND THE COMPANY MADE NO VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN. IN 2012 AND 2011, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY MADE

CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $217 MILLION AND $185 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL BE MADE

DURING 2014. THERE IS NO REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION TO THE QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN DURING 2014. WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN PENSION PLANS, THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS

IN 2014.

THE

DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION USED TO DETERMINE THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS BASED ON A YIELD-CURVE APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH, A WEIGHTED AVERAGE YIELD IS DETERMINED FROM A HYPOTHETICAL

PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED MATURITY CORPORATE BONDS (RATED AA) AVAILABLE AT THE YEAR-END VALUATION DATE FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH OUTFLOWS CORRESPOND WITH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF

THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYOUTS OF THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT PLAN.

IN

CHOOSING THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY SELECTED THE RATE THAT WAS SET AS THE RETURN OBJECTIVE BY THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT PLANS INVESTMENT COMMITTEE,

WHICH HAD CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL RETURNS OF EQUITY AND FIXED MATURITY MARKETS IN CONJUNCTION WITH PREVAILING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

AS

AN INDICATOR OF SENSITIVITY, INCREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $20 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013, AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

DECREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 BY $17 MILLION AND THE AGGREGATE OF

THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

14. PENSION PLANS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND SAVINGS PLANS (CONTINUED)

THE

ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN AND

THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN.

PLAN ASSETS

THE U.S. QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF THE PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES AND

ARE INTENDED, OVER TIME, TO SATISFY THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PLAN. RISK TOLERANCE IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH CONSIDERATION OF PLAN LIABILITIES, PLAN FUNDED STATUS AND CORPORATE FINANCIAL

POSITION. THE ASSET MIX GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO SERVE AS TOOLS TO FACILITATE THE INVESTMENT OF PLAN ASSETS TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM

TOTAL RETURN AND THE ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF THE PLAN'S INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. INVESTMENT RISK IS MEASURED AND MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS THROUGH DAILY AND MONTHLY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REVIEWS,

ANNUAL LIABILITY MEASUREMENTS AND PERIODIC ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES.

THE

COMPANY'S OVERALL INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR THE U.S. QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN IS TO ACHIEVE A MIX OF APPROXIMATELY 85% TO 90% OF INVESTMENTS FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND 10% TO 15%

FOR NEAR-TERM BENEFIT PAYMENTS WITH A WIDE DIVERSIFICATION OF ASSET TYPES, FUND STRATEGIES AND FUND MANAGERS. THE CURRENT TARGET ALLOCATIONS FOR PLAN ASSETS ARE 55% TO 65% EQUITY SECURITIES AND 20% TO

40% FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER ALLOCATED TO SHORT-TERM SECURITIES. EQUITY SECURITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN LARGE, MEDIUM AND SMALL-CAP COMPANIES PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE

UNITED STATES. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES INCLUDE CORPORATE BONDS OF COMPANIES FROM DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY FOREIGN

GOVERNMENTS. OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE TWO PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS HELD BY THE COMPANY'S QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN. ONE PRIVATE EQUITY FUND IS FOCUSED ON FINANCIAL COMPANIES, AND THE OTHER

IS FOCUSED ON REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS.

ASSETS

OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN PENSION PLANS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTPENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ASSETS

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE METHODS EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTED ASSETS, SEE NOTE 4. THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ASSETS.

FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES FOR EQUITY AND BOND MUTUAL FUNDS HELD BY THE PENSION PLANS REFLECT PRICES RECEIVED FROM AN EXTERNAL PRICING SERVICE THAT ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET TRANSACTIONS.

THESE ESTIMATES ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1.

SHORT-TERM

SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WHICH APPROXIMATES COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST OR AMORTIZED DISCOUNT. THE FAIR VALUE OR MARKET VALUE OF THESE IS PERIODICALLY COMPARED TO

THIS AMORTIZED COST AND IS BASED ON SIGNIFICANT OBSERVABLE INPUTS AS DETERMINED BY AN EXTERNAL PRICING SERVICE. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, OTHER THAN U.S.

TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS, PROVIDED BY AN EXTERNAL PRICING SERVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF U.S.

TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS IS INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 AS THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON UNADJUSTED MARKET PRICES.

SAVINGS PLAN

THE COMPANY HAS A SAVINGS PLAN, THE TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE SAVINGS PLAN), IN WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. DOMESTIC COMPANY

EMPLOYEES ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. UNDER THE SAVINGS PLAN, THE COMPANY MATCHES EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 5% OF ELIGIBLE PAY, WITH A MAXIMUM ANNUAL MATCH OF $6,000 WHICH BECOMES 100% VESTED

AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHOSE ANNUAL BASE SALARY ON DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS $175,000 OR MORE, AND EMPLOYEES HIRED DURING 2011

AT AN ANNUAL BASE SALARY OF $175,000 OR MORE, WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE COMPANY'S MATCHING CONTRIBUTION. THE COMPANY'S MATCHING CONTRIBUTION IS MADE IN CASH AND INVESTED ACCORDING TO THE EMPLOYEE'S

CURRENT INVESTMENT ELECTIONS. THE COMPANY'S MATCHING CONTRIBUTION CAN BE REINVESTED AT ANY TIME INTO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT OPTION. THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN SEPARATE SAVINGS

PLANS. THE TOTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO ALL OF THE SAVINGS PLANS WAS $100 MILLION, $92 MILLION AND $90 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011,

RESPECTIVELY.

INCLUDED

IN THE SAVINGS PLAN ARE A LEGACY SAVINGS PLUS PLAN (SPP) AND A STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP) IN WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES WHO WERE HIRED BY LEGACY SPC BEFORE

APRIL 1, 2004 WERE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN 2004 UNDER THE SPP, THE COMPANY MATCHED 100% OF EMPLOYEES' CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 6% OF THEIR SALARY. THE MATCH WAS IN THE FORM OF

PREFERRED SHARES, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE IN THE SOP, OR IN THE COMPANY'S COMMON SHARES. ALSO ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS WERE PREFERRED SHARES EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF DIVIDENDS ON PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED

SHARES. EACH SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK PAID A DIVIDEND OF $11.72 ANNUALLY AND WAS CONVERTIBLE INTO EIGHT SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE SOP HAS NO PREFERRED SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE

ALLOCATIONS. AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 9 ABOVE, ALL PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING ON JUNE 7, 2011 (190,083 SHARES) WERE CONVERTED INTO A TOTAL OF 1.52 MILLION SHARES OF

THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK.

ALL

COMMON SHARES HELD BY THE SAVINGS PLAN ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR DILUTED EPS COMPUTATIONS AND DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALL SHARES ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

RENT EXPENSE WAS $196 MILLION, $192 MILLION AND $191 MILLION IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

CONTINGENCIES

THE MAJOR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS, TO WHICH THE COMPANY OR ANY OF

ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS A PARTY OR TO WHICH ANY OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTIES IS SUBJECT ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED PROCEEDINGS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AND CONTINUES TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FOR INSURANCE ARISING UNDER

POLICIES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY ASSERTING ALLEGED INJURIES AND DAMAGES FROM ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED EXPOSURES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

THE LITIGATION DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES OF THESE

DISPUTES ARE UNCERTAIN. IN THIS REGARD, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE, INCLUDING SETTLING LITIGATION

UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES.

ASBESTOS DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION

IN OCTOBER 2001 AND APRIL 2002, TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS (

WISE V.

TRAVELERS

AND

MENINGER V. TRAVELERS

) WERE FILED AGAINST TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY

CORP. (TPC), A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, AND OTHER INSURERS (NOT INCLUDING THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. (SPC), WHICH WAS ACQUIRED BY TPC IN 2004) IN STATE COURT IN WEST

VIRGINIA. THESE AND OTHER CASES SUBSEQUENTLY FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE PROCEEDING IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE

INSURER DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES IN VIOLATION OF STATE STATUTES BY INAPPROPRIATELY HANDLING AND SETTLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO REOPEN LARGE NUMBERS OF SETTLED

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, DIRECTLY ON INSURERS. SIMILAR LAWSUITS ALLEGING INAPPROPRIATE HANDLING AND SETTLING OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS WERE FILED IN

MASSACHUSETTS AND HAWAII STATE COURTS. THESE SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS.

IN

MARCH 2002, THE PLAINTIFFS IN CONSOLIDATED ASBESTOS ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE A MASS TORT PANEL OF JUDGES IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT AMENDED THEIR COMPLAINT TO INCLUDE TPC AS A

DEFENDANT, ALLEGING THAT TPC AND OTHER INSURERS BREACHED ALLEGED DUTIES TO CERTAIN USERS OF ASBESTOS PRODUCTS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF

AND RAISING SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS, PRIMARILY VIOLATIONS OF PURPORTED COMMON LAW DUTIES TO THIRD PARTIES, HAVE ALSO BEEN ASSERTED IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS AGAINST TPC AND SPC. THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THESE

SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS.

IN

RESPONSE TO THESE CLAIMS, TPC MOVED TO ENJOIN THE STATUTORY ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS IN THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT HAD PRESIDED OVER THE BANKRUPTCY OF TPC'S FORMER

POLICYHOLDER JOHNS-MANVILLE CORPORATION ON THE GROUND THAT THE SUITS VIOLATED INJUNCTIONS ENTERED IN CONNECTION WITH CONFIRMATION OF THE JOHNS-MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY (THE "1986 ORDERS"). THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT

ISSUED A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND REFERRED THE PARTIES TO MEDIATION. IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS, WHICH INCLUDED A LUMP-SUM

PAYMENT OF UP TO $412 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. IN MAY 2004, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT RESOLVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PENDING AND SIMILAR FUTURE

COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, WHICH INCLUDED A PAYMENT OF UP TO $90 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO SIMILAR CONTINGENCIES. AMONG THE CONTINGENCIES FOR EACH OF THESE SETTLEMENTS WAS THAT THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT ISSUE AN ORDER, WHICH MUST BECOME A FINAL ORDER, CLARIFYING THAT ALL OF THESE CLAIMS, AND SIMILAR FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, AS WELL AS RELATED CONTRIBUTION CLAIMS,

ARE BARRED BY THE 1986 ORDERS.

ON

AUGUST 17, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED AN ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS AND CLARIFYING THAT THE 1986 ORDERS BARRED THE PENDING STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON LAW CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST TPC (THE "CLARIFYING ORDER"). THE CLARIFYING ORDER ALSO APPLIES TO SIMILAR DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE. ALTHOUGH THE

DISTRICT COURT SUBSTANTIALLY AFFIRMED THE CLARIFYING ORDER, ON FEBRUARY 15, 2008, THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED AN OPINION VACATING ON JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS THE DISTRICT COURT'S APPROVAL OF THE

CLARIFYING ORDER.

ON

DECEMBER 12, 2008, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT GRANTED TPC'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI AND, ON JUNE 18, 2009, THE SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S

FEBRUARY 15, 2008 DECISION, FINDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE 1986 ORDERS ARE FINAL AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COLLATERALLY CHALLENGED ON JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS. THE SUPREME COURT FURTHER

RULED THAT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT HAD JURISDICTION TO ISSUE THE CLARIFYING ORDER. HOWEVER, SINCE THE SECOND CIRCUIT HAD NOT RULED ON CERTAIN ADDITIONAL ISSUES, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO PROCEDURAL MATTERS

AND THE ADEQUACY OF NOTICE PROVIDED TO CERTAIN PARTIES, THE SUPREME COURT REMANDED THE CASE TO THE SECOND CIRCUIT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS ON THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES.

ON

MARCH 22, 2010, THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED AN OPINION IN WHICH IT FOUND THAT THE NOTICE OF THE 1986 ORDERS PROVIDED TO ONE REMAINING OBJECTOR WAS INSUFFICIENT TO BAR

CONTRIBUTION CLAIMS BY THAT OBJECTOR AGAINST TPC. TPC'S PETITION FOR REHEARING AND REHEARING

EN BANC

WAS DENIED MAY 25, 2010 AND ITS PETITION FOR

WRIT OF CERTIORARI AND PETITION FOR A WRIT OF MANDAMUS WERE DENIED BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ON NOVEMBER 29, 2010.

THE

PLAINTIFFS IN THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS ACTIONS THEREAFTER FILED MOTIONS IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT TO COMPEL TPC TO MAKE PAYMENT UNDER THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS, ARGUING THAT ALL CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE SETTLEMENTS HAD BEEN MET. ON DECEMBER 16, 2010, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT GRANTED THE PLAINTIFFS' MOTIONS AND RULED THAT TPC WAS REQUIRED TO

FUND THE SETTLEMENTS. THE COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT AGAINST TPC ON JANUARY 20, 2011 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS RULING AND ORDERED TPC TO PAY THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS PLUS PREJUDGMENT INTEREST. THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT'S JUDGMENT WAS REVERSED BY THE DISTRICT COURT ON MARCH 1, 2012, THE DISTRICT COURT HAVING FOUND THAT THE CONDITIONS TO THE SETTLEMENTS HAD NOT BEEN MET IN VIEW OF THE SECOND

CIRCUIT'S MARCH 22, 2010 RULING PERMITTING THE FILING OF CONTRIBUTION CLAIMS AGAINST TPC. THE PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURT'S MARCH 1, 2012 DECISION TO THE SECOND CIRCUIT COURT

OF APPEALS. ORAL ARGUMENT BEFORE THE SECOND CIRCUIT TOOK PLACE ON JANUARY 10, 2013, AND THE PARTIES AWAIT THE COURT'S DECISION.

SPC,

WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY COURT RULINGS OR THE SETTLEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, FROM TIME TO TIME HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN DIRECT ACTION CASES IN TEXAS

STATE COURT ASSERTING COMMON LAW CLAIMS. ALL SUCH CASES THAT ARE STILL PENDING AND IN WHICH SPC HAS BEEN SERVED ARE CURRENTLY ON THE INACTIVE DOCKET IN TEXAS STATE COURT. IF ANY OF THOSE CASES BECOMES

ACTIVE, SPC

TO LITIGATE THOSE CASES VIGOROUSLY. SPC WAS PREVIOUSLY A DEFENDANT IN SIMILAR DIRECT ACTIONS IN OHIO STATE COURT, WHICH HAVE BEEN DISMISSED FOLLOWING FAVORABLE RULINGS BY OHIO TRIAL AND

APPELLATE COURTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, SPC AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN NAMED IN SIMILAR INDIVIDUAL DIRECT ACTIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

OUTCOME AND IMPACT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT LEGAL OUTCOMES AND

THEIR IMPACT ON

THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. ANY SUCH DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES

IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT

CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT ARISING UNDER INSURANCE CONTRACTS OR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN OTHER LAWSUITS, INCLUDING LAWSUITS ALLEGING EXTRA-CONTRACTUAL DAMAGES RELATING TO INSURANCE CONTRACTS OR

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THAT DO NOT ARISE UNDER INSURANCE CONTRACTS OR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. BASED UPON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT

ANY SUCH LAWSUIT OR RELATED LAWSUITS WOULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

GAIN CONTINGENCIES

ON AUGUST 17, 2010, IN A REINSURANCE DISPUTE IN NEW YORK STATE COURT CAPTIONED

UNITED STATES

FIDELITY & GUARANTY COMPANY V. AMERICAN RE-INSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL.,

THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR UNITED STATES FIDELITY AND GUARANTY COMPANY (USF&G), A

SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, AND DENIED SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR AMERICAN RE-INSURANCE COMPANY, A SUBSIDIARY OF MUNICH RE (AMERICAN RE), AND THREE OTHER REINSURERS. BY ORDER DATED OCTOBER 22, 2010,

THE TRIAL COURT CORRECTED CERTAIN CLERICAL ERRORS AND MADE CERTAIN CLARIFICATIONS TO THE AUGUST 17, 2010 ORDER. ON OCTOBER 25, 2010, JUDGMENT WAS ENTERED AGAINST AMERICAN RE AND THE

OTHER THREE INSURERS, AWARDING USF&G $420 MILLION, COMPRISING $251 MILLION CEDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE DISPUTED REINSURANCE CONTRACT PLUS INTEREST OF 9% AMOUNTING TO $169 MILLION

AS OF THAT DATE. THE JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE AWARD OF INTEREST, WAS APPEALED BY THE REINSURERS TO THE NEW YORK SUPREME COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, FIRST DEPARTMENT. ON JANUARY 24, 2012, THE

APPELLATE DIVISION AFFIRMED THE JUDGMENT. ON JANUARY 30, 2012, THE REINSURERS FILED A MOTION WITH THE APPELLATE DIVISION SEEKING PERMISSION TO APPEAL ITS DECISION TO THE NEW YORK COURT OF

APPEALS, AND ON MARCH 12, 2012, THE APPELLATE DIVISION GRANTED THE REINSURERS' MOTION. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2013, THE COURT OF APPEALS ISSUED AN OPINION THAT LARGELY AFFIRMED THE SUMMARY

JUDGMENT IN USF&G'S FAVOR, WHILE MODIFYING IN PART THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO TWO DISCRETE ISSUES AND REMANDING THE CASE TO THE TRIAL COURT FOR DETERMINATION OF THOSE ISSUES. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES IT HAS A MERITORIOUS POSITION ON EACH OF THESE ISSUES AND INTENDS TO PURSUE ITS CLAIM VIGOROUSLY. ON MAY 2, 2013, THE COURT OF APPEALS DENIED A

MOTION BY REINSURERS TO RECONSIDER THE FEBRUARY 7, 2013 OPINION. IN NOVEMBER 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF THE REINSURERS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE

CLAIM TOTALED $466 MILLION, COMPRISING THE

$238 MILLION

OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE PLUS INTEREST AMOUNTING TO $228 MILLION AS OF THAT DATE. INTEREST WILL CONTINUE TO ACCRUE AT 9% UNTIL THE CLAIM IS PAID. THE $238 MILLION

OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE OWED TO USF&G UNDER THE TERMS OF THE DISPUTED REINSURANCE CONTRACT HAS BEEN REPORTED AS PART OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE

INTEREST THAT WOULD BE OWED AS PART OF ANY JUDGMENT ULTIMATELY ENTERED IN FAVOR OF USF&G IS TREATED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES AS A GAIN CONTINGENCY IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB TOPIC 450,

CONTINGENCIES,

AND ACCORDINGLY HAS NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN

AN UNRELATED ACTION, THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY IS ONE OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS PLAINTIFFS AND A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT CAPTIONED

SAFECO

INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA, ET AL. V AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. ET AL.

(U.S. DISTRICT COURT, N.D. ILL.) IN WHICH THE DEFENDANTS ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE ENGAGED IN

THE UNDER-REPORTING OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH A WORKERS' COMPENSATION REINSURANCE POOL IN WHICH SEVERAL SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY PARTICIPATE. ON JULY 26, 2011, THE

COURT GRANTED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF A CLASS SETTLEMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH THE DEFENDANTS AGREED TO PAY $450 MILLION TO THE CLASS. ON DECEMBER 21, 2011, THE COURT ENTERED AN ORDER

GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT, AND ON FEBRUARY 28, 2012, THE DISTRICT COURT ISSUED A WRITTEN OPINION APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT. ON MARCH 27, 2012, THREE PARTIES WHO OBJECTED

TO THE SETTLEMENT APPEALED THE COURT'S ORDERS APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT. ON JANUARY 11, 2013, ALL PARTIES, INCLUDING THE THREE PARTIES WHO

HAD OBJECTED TO THE SETTLEMENT, FILED A STIPULATION OF DISMISSAL INDICATING THAT THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY OBJECTIONS TO THE SETTLEMENT. ON MARCH 25, 2013, THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT DISMISSED THE

APPEALS. ON APRIL 16, 2013, THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT ISSUED ITS MANDATE RETURNING THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR ADMINISTRATION OF THE SETTLEMENT. PRIOR TO RECEIVING PAYMENT, THE COMPANY

ACCOUNTED FOR ITS ANTICIPATED ALLOCATION FROM THE SETTLEMENT FUND AS A GAIN CONTINGENCY IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB TOPIC 450,

CONTINGENCIES.

ON

JUNE 26, 2013, THE COMPANY RECEIVED PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $91 MILLION, COMPRISING 98% OF ITS ALLOCATION FROM THE SETTLEMENT FUND. ON NOVEMBER 11, 2013, THE COMPANY RECEIVED

PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION, COMPRISING THE REMAINING 2% TO BE PAID FROM THE SETTLEMENT FUND. THE COMBINATION OF THE PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN JUNE AND NOVEMBER 2013 TOTALING

$93 MILLION, LESS APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION REMITTED TO ANOTHER INSURER, RESULTED IN A NET GAIN OF $91 MILLION THAT IS REPORTED IN "OTHER REVENUES" IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME.

18. CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

THE FOLLOWING CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN PREPARED PURSUANT TO RULE 3-10 OF REGULATION S-X. THESE CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE

ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (EXCHANGE ACT)) THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY'S REPORTS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED,

PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S RULES AND FORMS, AND THAT SUCH

INFORMATION IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED

DISCLOSURES. ANY CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THE DESIRED CONTROL OBJECTIVES. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, WITH

THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, HAS EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANY'S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. CONSISTENT WITH GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION THAT AN ASSESSMENT OF A RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESS MAY BE OMITTED FROM MANAGEMENT'S EVALUATION

OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES IN THE YEAR OF ACQUISITION, MANAGEMENT EXCLUDED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO DOMINION. THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF DOMINION ON NOVEMBER 1, 2013. DOMINION REPRESENTED LESS THAN 4% OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS AND LESS THAN 1% OF EACH

OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL REVENUES AND NET INCOME AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013. BASED UPON THAT EVALUATION AND SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, THE COMPANY'S CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANY'S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE TO ACCOMPLISH

THEIR OBJECTIVES AT THE REASONABLE ASSURANCE LEVEL.

IN

ADDITION, THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) THAT

OCCURRED DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. AS

MENTIONED ABOVE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED DOMINION ON NOVEMBER 1, 2013. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE INTERNAL CONTROL STRUCTURE OF DOMINION AND, IF NECESSARY, WILL MAKE

APPROPRIATE CHANGES AS IT INTEGRATES DOMINION INTO THE COMPANY'S OVERALL INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED

BY MANAGEMENT, ARE UNDER THE GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF THE COMPANY'S AUDIT COMMITTEE.

THE

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.



PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF

ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT

HAS ASSESSED THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. THE STANDARD MEASURES ADOPTED BY MANAGEMENT IN MAKING ITS EVALUATION ARE

THE MEASURES IN THE

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(1992) PUBLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION.

CONSISTENT

WITH GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION THAT AN ASSESSMENT OF A RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESS MAY BE OMITTED FROM MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN THE YEAR OF ACQUISITION, MANAGEMENT EXCLUDED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING RELATED TO DOMINION. THE COMPANY

ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF DOMINION ON NOVEMBER 1, 2013. DOMINION REPRESENTED LESS THAN 4% OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS AND LESS THAN 1% OF EACH OF THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL REVENUES AND NET INCOME AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

BASED

UPON ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, AND THAT THERE WERE NO

MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF THAT DATE.

KPMG LLP,

AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, WHICH HAS AUDITED AND REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-K, HAS ISSUED

ITS REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WHICH FOLLOWS THIS REPORT.

263

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC..

WE

HAVE AUDITED THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES' (THE COMPANY) INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(1992) ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION

(COSO). THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO

OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR

AUDIT ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN

OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

(1992) ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY (DOMINION) ON NOVEMBER 1, 2013. MANAGEMENT EXCLUDED DOMINION FROM

ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. DOMINION REPRESENTED LESS THAN 4% OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL

ASSETS AND LESS THAN 1% OF EACH OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL REVENUES AND NET INCOME AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING OF THE COMPANY ALSO EXCLUDED AN EVALUATION OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF DOMINION.

WE

ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OF THE TRAVELERS

COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, AND CASH

FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, AND OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 13, 2014 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES OR ADVERSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. SUCH INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS GENERALLY ARE APPLICABLE FROM THE CLOSING DATE TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE RELEVANT

STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, ALTHOUGH, IN SOME CASES, THERE MAY BE AGREED UPON TERM LIMITATIONS OR NO TERM LIMITATIONS. CERTAIN OF THESE CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES WHICH HAVE TO BE

TRV

ALSO HAS CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS FOR GUARANTEES RELATED TO ITS SUBSIDIARY'S DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND VARIOUS OTHER INDEMNIFICATIONS. TRV ALSO PROVIDES STANDARD INDEMNIFICATIONS TO SERVICE

PROVIDERS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES ARE OFTEN STANDARD CONTRACTUAL TERMS. CERTAIN OF THESE GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE NO STATED OR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OR

LIMITATION TO THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS, AND, ACCORDINGLY, TRV IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL PAYMENTS FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS.
