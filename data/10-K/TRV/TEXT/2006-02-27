BUSINESS

THE

ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY) IS A HOLDING COMPANY PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED, THROUGH

ITS SUBSIDIARIES, IN PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY

AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT UNITS,

ASSOCIATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. THE COMPANY, KNOWN AS THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES,

INC. (SPC) PRIOR TO ITS MERGER WITH TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) IN

2004, IS INCORPORATED AS A GENERAL BUSINESS CORPORATION UNDER THE LAWS OF THE

STATE OF MINNESOTA AND IS ONE OF THE OLDEST INSURANCE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE

UNITED STATES, DATING BACK TO 1853. THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF THE

COMPANY ARE LOCATED AT 385 WASHINGTON STREET, ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA 55102, AND

THE TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (651) 310-7911.

ON

APRIL 1, 2004, TPC MERGED WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF SPC, AS A RESULT OF WHICH TPC

BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF SPC, AND SPC CHANGED ITS NAME TO THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THIS TRANSACTION WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE ACQUISITION WITH TPC TREATED AS THE ACCOUNTING

ACQUIRER. ACCORDINGLY, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE

BUSINESS COMBINATION, USING TPCS HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND APPLYING

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS OF SPC

AS OF APRIL 1, 2004. BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF SPC WERE CONSOLIDATED WITH TPCS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ACCORDINGLY, ALL FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED

HEREIN FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTS OF

TPC FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 AND THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS OF

SPC AND TPC FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE FINANCIAL

INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN FOR 2003 REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTS OF TPC. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, EACH ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARE OF TPC CLASS A

AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK (INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE

RIGHTS) WAS EXCHANGED FOR 0.4334 OF A SHARE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. ALL

SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS FOR ALL PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT

THE EXCHANGE OF TPCS COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.01 PER SHARE, FOR THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK WITHOUT DESIGNATED PAR VALUE, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO SHARE

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE TPC INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN 2002.

TPC

IS A CONNECTICUT CORPORATION THAT WAS FORMED IN 1979 AND, PRIOR TO ITS MARCH

2002 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK (IPO), WAS AN INDIRECT

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CITIGROUP INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES, CITIGROUP). TPC WAS REORGANIZED IN CONNECTION WITH ITS IPO IN

MARCH 2002. PURSUANT TO THE REORGANIZATION, WHICH WAS COMPLETED ON MARCH 19,

2002, TPCS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE

ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN FORMERLY WHOLLY-OWNED TPC SUBSIDIARIES, PRINCIPALLY THE

TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (BEING THE FORMER U.S. LIFE

INSURANCE OPERATIONS OF TPC), CERTAIN OTHER WHOLLY-OWNED NON-INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES OF TPC AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF TPCS ASSETS AND CERTAIN

LIABILITIES NOT RELATED TO THE PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE BUSINESS.

IN

THE IPO, ON MARCH 21, 2002, TPC ISSUED 231 MILLION SHARES* OF ITS CLASS A

COMMON STOCK, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 23% OF TPCS COMMON EQUITY. AFTER THE

IPO, CITIGROUP INC. BENEFICIALLY OWNED ALL OF THE 500 MILLION SHARES* OF TPCS

OUTSTANDING CLASS B COMMON STOCK, EACH SHARE OF WHICH WAS ENTITLED TO SEVEN

VOTES, AND 269 MILLION SHARES* OF TPCS CLASS A COMMON STOCK, EACH SHARE OF WHICH

WAS ENTITLED TO ONE VOTE, REPRESENTING AT THE TIME 94% OF THE COMBINED VOTING

POWER OF ALL CLASSES OF TPCS VOTING SECURITIES AND 77% OF THE EQUITY INTEREST

IN TPC. ON AUGUST 20, 2002, CITIGROUP MADE A TAX-FREE DISTRIBUTION TO ITS

STOCKHOLDERS (THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION), OF A PORTION OF ITS OWNERSHIP

INTEREST IN TPC, WHICH, TOGETHER WITH THE SHARES ISSUED IN THE IPO, REPRESENTED

MORE THAN 90% OF TPCS COMMON EQUITY AND MORE THAN 90% OF THE COMBINED VOTING

POWER OF TPCS OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES. CITIGROUP RECEIVED A PRIVATE

LETTER RULING FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE THAT THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION

WAS TAX-FREE TO CITIGROUP, ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND TPC. AS PART OF THE RULING PROCESS,

CITIGROUP AGREED TO VOTE THE SHARES IT CONTINUED TO HOLD OF TPC FOLLOWING THE

CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION PRO RATA WITH THE SHARES HELD BY THE PUBLIC AND TO

DIVEST THE REMAINING SHARES IT HOLDS WITHIN FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE CITIGROUP

DISTRIBUTION. AFTER THE MERGER, THIS UNDERTAKING ALSO APPLIES TO SHARES OF

COMPANY COMMON STOCK.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, CITIGROUP HELD FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT 1.80% AND 6.50% OF

THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003,

CITIGROUP HELD FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT 9.87% OF TPCS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS ORGANIZED AS FOLLOWS: (I) A

DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THE COMPANYS THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS (COMMERCIAL,

SPECIALTY AND PERSONAL) AND RELATED SERVICES; (II) A DESCRIPTION OF INTEREST

EXPENSE AND OTHER; AND (III) CERTAIN OTHER INFORMATION. FOR A SUMMARY OF THE

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING

LEVELS FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY

DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN EXPECTATION OF ESTIMATED LOSSES, THE EXPENSES OF

PRODUCING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT.

COMMERCIAL HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT

EMPHASIZES PROFITABLE GROWTH RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE.

COMMERCIAL

HAS DEVELOPED AN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES

UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

DISCIPLINES FOR PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN

HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DISCIPLINE. IT UTILIZES PROPRIETARY DATA

GATHERED AND ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO ITS COMMERCIAL BUSINESS OVER MANY YEARS.

THE UNDERWRITERS AND ENGINEERS USE THIS INFORMATION TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE

RISKS PRIOR TO QUOTATION. THIS INFORMATION PROVIDES SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT

SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. THIS METHODOLOGY ENABLES COMMERCIAL TO STREAMLINE

ITS RISK SELECTION PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING PARAMETERS THAT WILL NOT

COMPROMISE COMMERCIALS UNDERWRITING INTEGRITY.

FOR

SMALLER BUSINESSES, SELECT ACCOUNTS USES A PROCESS BASED ON INDUSTRY

CLASSIFICATIONS TO ALLOW AGENTS AND FIELD UNDERWRITING REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE

UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DECISIONS WITHIN PREDETERMINED CLASSIFICATIONS, BECAUSE

UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND PRICING TEND TO BE MORE STANDARDIZED FOR THESE

SMALLER EXPOSURES.

4

A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF COMMERCIAL BUSINESS IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE

INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH

DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT THE FULL

AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE

CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, AND IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK UNTIL

SUCH REIMBURSEMENT IS MADE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES

AND PAYABLES ON UNPAID LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES WERE

EACH APPROXIMATELY $5.23 BILLION. RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES ARE ALSO USED

FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE. ALTHOUGH THE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED FEATURE

OF THE POLICY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES INSURANCE RISK FOR THE COMPANY, IT

INTRODUCES ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY. PREMIUM RECEIVABLES FROM

HOLDERS OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $308 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005. SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND, TO

A LESSER EXTENT CASH COLLATERAL AND SURETY BONDS, IS GENERALLY REQUESTED FOR

LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PLANS AND/OR RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES THAT PROVIDE FOR

DEFERRED COLLECTION OF DEDUCTIBLE RECOVERIES AND/OR ULTIMATE PREMIUMS. THE

AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL REQUESTED IS PREDICATED UPON THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE

CUSTOMER AND THE NATURE OF THE INSURED RISKS. COMMERCIAL CONTINUALLY MONITORS

THE CREDIT EXPOSURE ON INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS AND THE ADEQUACY OF COLLATERAL.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO NATURAL AND MANMADE PERIL

CATASTROPHIC LOSSES AND ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE SUCH EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY USES

VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER MODELING

TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE UNDERWRITING RISKS OF BUSINESS IN HURRICANE-PRONE,

EARTHQUAKE-PRONE AND TARGET RISK AREAS. THE COMPANY RELIES UPON THIS ANALYSIS

TO MAKE UNDERWRITING DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE ON CATASTROPHE-EXPOSED

BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES REINSURANCE TO MANAGE ITS AGGREGATE

EXPOSURES TO CATASTROPHES. SEE REINSURANCE.

PRODUCT LINES

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY AND

LIABILITY COVERAGE. PROPERTY INSURANCE COVERS DAMAGES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY

FIRE, WIND, HAIL, WATER, THEFT AND VANDALISM, AND PROTECTS BUSINESSES FROM

FINANCIAL LOSS DUE TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION RESULTING FROM A COVERED LOSS.

LIABILITY COVERAGE INSURES BUSINESSES AGAINST THIRD PARTIES FROM ACCIDENTS OCCURRING

ON THEIR PREMISES OR ARISING OUT OF THEIR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS INJURIES

SUSTAINED FROM PRODUCTS SOLD.

WORKERS COMPENSATION

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYERS FOR

SPECIFIED BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW FOR WORKPLACE INJURIES TO

EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE TYPICALLY FOUR TYPES OF BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER WORKERS

COMPENSATION POLICIES: MEDICAL BENEFITS, DISABILITY BENEFITS, DEATH BENEFITS

AND VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION BENEFITS. THE COMPANY EMPHASIZES MANAGED CARE

COST CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES, WHICH INVOLVE EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES AND CARE

PROVIDERS IN A COOPERATIVE EFFORT THAT FOCUSES ON THE INJURED EMPLOYEES EARLY

RETURN TO WORK, COST-EFFECTIVE QUALITY CARE, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THIS

MARKET. THE COMPANY OFFERS THE FOLLOWING THREE TYPES OF WORKERS COMPENSATION

PRODUCTS.



GUARANTEED COST INSURANCE PRODUCTS, IN WHICH

POLICY PREMIUM CHARGES ARE FIXED FOR THE PERIOD OF COVERAGE AND DO NOT VARY AS

A RESULT OF THE INSUREDS LOSS EXPERIENCE;



LOSS-SENSITIVE INSURANCE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

LARGE DEDUCTIBLE AND RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES, IN WHICH FEES OR PREMIUMS

ARE ADJUSTED BASED ON ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE OF THE INSURED DURING THE POLICY

PERIOD; AND



SERVICE PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY SOLD TO

THE COMPANYS NATIONAL ACCOUNTS CUSTOMERS, WHERE THE COMPANY RECEIVES FEES

RATHER THAN PREMIUMS FOR PROVIDING LOSS PREVENTION, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND CLAIM

AND BENEFIT ADMINISTRATION SERVICES TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER SERVICE AGREEMENTS.

THE COMPANY ALSO PARTICIPATES IN STATE ASSIGNED RISK POOLS AS A SERVICING

CARRIER AND POOL PARTICIPANT.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR BUSINESSES AGAINST

LOSSES INCURRED FROM PERSONAL BODILY INJURY, BODILY INJURY TO THIRD PARTIES,

PROPERTY DAMAGE TO AN INSUREDS VEHICLE, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE TO OTHER VEHICLES

AND OTHER PROPERTY RESULTING FROM THE OWNERSHIP, MAINTENANCE OR USE OF

AUTOMOBILES AND TRUCKS IN A BUSINESS.

PROPERTY

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE TO BUILDINGS, INVENTORY AND

EQUIPMENT FROM NATURAL DISASTERS, INCLUDING HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES,

HAIL, AND SEVERE WINTER WEATHER. ALSO COVERED ARE MANMADE EVENTS SUCH AS THEFT,

VANDALISM, FIRES, EXPLOSIONS, TERRORISM AND FINANCIAL LOSS DUE TO BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION RESULTING FROM COVERED PROPERTY DAMAGE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

STANDARD AND SPECIALIZED INSURANCE COVERAGES AND SERVICES THROUGH DEDICATED

UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS HANDLING AND RISK MANAGEMENT GROUPS. IN MANY OF ITS

BUSINESSES, SPECIALTY COMPETES THROUGH THE USE OF PROPRIETARY RATES AND POLICY

FORMS. THE SEGMENT COMPRISES TWO PRIMARY GROUPS: DOMESTIC SPECIALTY AND

INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY.

BROKERS, WHERE OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE PROVIDING THE PRIMARY COVERAGE.

THIS GROUP ALSO PROVIDES COVERAGES IN THE CASE WHERE OTHER COMPANY BUSINESS

GROUPS PREFER TO OUTSOURCE THE UNDERWRITING OF UMBRELLA AND EXCESS BUSINESS

BASED ON THE EXPERTISE AND/OR LIMIT CAPACITY OF SEU. THE COVERAGES UNDERWRITTEN

ARE TYPICALLY COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY AND PRODUCT LIABILITY.

UMBRELLA COVERAGE MAY ALSO BE UNDERWRITTEN OVER A COMPANY THAT RETAINS RISK OR

HAS A SELF-INSURED RETENTION, INSTEAD OF A SCHEDULED UNDERLYING POLICY.

(B)

EXCESS & SURPLUS LINES

(E&S LINES)

OFFERS

MONO-LINE UMBRELLA AND EXCESS COVERAGE WHERE THE COMPANY DOES NOT WRITE THE

PRIMARY CASUALTY COVERAGE, OR WHERE OTHER BUSINESS GROUPS WITHIN THE COMPANY

PREFER TO OUTSOURCE THE UNDERWRITING OF UMBRELLA AND EXCESS BUSINESS BASED ON

THE EXPERTISE AND/OR LIMIT CAPACITY OF E&S LINES. BUSINESS IS WRITTEN ON A

NON-ADMITTED BASIS THROUGH ESTABLISHED WHOLESALERS. THE COVERAGES TYPICALLY

UNDERWRITTEN INCLUDE COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY AND PRODUCT LIABILITY.

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE

COMPANY SOLD ITS PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK BUSINESS, WHICH HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN

THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE

COMPANY RETAINED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PRE-SALE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

PRINCIPAL MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION

SPECIALTY

DISTRIBUTES THE MAJORITY OF ITS SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS DOMESTICALLY

THROUGH THE SAME BASE OF APPROXIMATELY 6,300 INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS

THAT DISTRIBUTE THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENTS PRODUCTS. THESE BROKERS AND

INDEPENDENT AGENCIES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND ARE SERVICED

BY THREE CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTERS. IN RECENT YEARS, SPECIALTY HAS MADE

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ENHANCED TECHNOLOGY UTILIZING INTERNET-BASED

APPLICATIONS TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME INTERFACE CAPABILITIES WITH ITS INDEPENDENT

AGENCIES AND BROKERS. SPECIALTY SPECIFICALLY SEEKS DISTRIBUTION SPECIALISTS

THAT MATCH THE SPECIALTY EXPERTISE OF ITS UNDERWRITING GROUP. SPECIALTY BUILDS

RELATIONSHIPS WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED, INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENCIES AND

BROKERS. IN SELECTING NEW INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS TO DISTRIBUTE ITS

PRODUCTS, SPECIALTY CONSIDERS EACH AGENCYS OR BROKERS PROFITABILITY,

FINANCIAL STABILITY, STAFF EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH ITS OPERATING AND

MARKETING PLANS. ONCE AN AGENCY OR BROKER IS APPOINTED, ITS ONGOING PERFORMANCE

IS MONITORED.

SPECIALTY

ALSO DISTRIBUTES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY PRODUCTS THROUGH SELECTED WHOLESALERS

USING SURPLUS LINES CONTRACTS, BOTH ON A BROKERAGE AND MANAGING GENERAL

UNDERWRITING BASIS. WHOLESALERS ARE USED BECAUSE THEY SERVE CERTAIN MARKETS

THAT ARE NOT TYPICALLY SERVED BY OUR APPOINTED RETAIL AGENTS. THE WHOLESALE

SURPLUS LINES MARKET ALLOWS FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY TO WRITE CERTAIN CLASSES OF

BUSINESS DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF RATE AND FORM REGULATION FOR SURPLUS LINES

BUSINESS. IN WORKING WITH WHOLESALERS ON A

8

BROKERAGE

BASIS, SPECIALTY UNDERWRITES THE BUSINESS AND SETS THE PREMIUM LEVEL. IN

WORKING WITH WHOLESALERS ON A MANAGING GENERAL UNDERWRITING (MGU) BASIS, THE

MGUS PRODUCE AND UNDERWRITE BUSINESS THAT CONFORMS TO SPECIALTYS UNDERWRITING

GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR EACH FACILITY.

SPECIALTY

DISTRIBUTES ITS SPECIALTY PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH BROKERS IN THE DOMESTIC

MARKETS OF EACH OF THE THREE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, THE UNITED

KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. SPECIALTY ALSO WRITES BUSINESS AT

LLOYDS, WHERE ITS PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH LLOYDS ACCREDITED BROKERS.

BY VIRTUE OF LLOYDS WORLDWIDE LICENSES, SPECIALTY HAS ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS ACROSS THE WORLD.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING

LEVELS FOR SPECIALTY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY

DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN EXPECTATION OF ESTIMATED LOSSES, THE EXPENSES OF

PRODUCING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT.

SPECIALTY HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT

EMPHASIZES PROFITABLE GROWTH RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE.

SPECIALTY

HAS DEVELOPED AN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES

DEDICATED UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

DISCIPLINES FOR PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN

HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DISCIPLINE, BASED ON AN IN-DEPTH

KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIFIC INDUSTRY. THE UNDERWRITERS AND ENGINEERS USE

PROPRIETARY DATA GATHERED AND ANALYZED OVER MANY YEARS TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE

RISKS PRIOR TO QUOTATION, AND THEN USE PROPRIETARY FORMS TO TAILOR INSURANCE

COVERAGE TO INSUREDS WITHIN THE TARGET MARKETS. THIS METHODOLOGY ENABLES

SPECIALTY TO STREAMLINE ITS RISK SELECTION PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING

PARAMETERS THAT WILL NOT COMPROMISE ITS UNDERWRITING INTEGRITY.

A

PORTION OF SPECIALTY BUSINESS IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE

POLICIES. UNDER SOME WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE

FEATURES, SPECIALTY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE

CLAIM. SPECIALTY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE

DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT AND IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK UNTIL SUCH REIMBURSEMENT IS

MADE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ON UNPAID

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES WERE EACH APPROXIMATELY $281 MILLION.

SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT

SURETY BONDS AND CASH COLLATERAL, IS GENERALLY REQUESTED FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE

PLANS THAT PROVIDE FOR DEFERRED COLLECTION OF DEDUCTIBLES. THE AMOUNT OF

COLLATERAL REQUESTED IS PREDICATED UPON THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER

AND THE NATURE OF THE INSURED RISKS. SPECIALTY CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE CREDIT

EXPOSURE AND THE ADEQUACY OF COLLATERAL.

PRODUCT LINES

GENERAL LIABILITY

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY EXPOSURES

INCLUDING BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE ARISING FROM PRODUCTS SOLD AND

GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SPECIALIZED LIABILITY POLICIES MAY ALSO INCLUDE

COVERAGE FOR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY ARISING IN THEIR OFFICIAL

TRUSTEES AND SPONSORS OF PENSION, HEALTH AND WELFARE, AND OTHER EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLANS, ERRORS AND OMISSIONS INSURANCE FOR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,

PROFESSIONALS AND OTHERS ARISING FROM ACTS OR FAILURES TO ACT UNDER SPECIFIED

CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS UMBRELLA AND EXCESS INSURANCE. ERRORS AND OMISSIONS

INSURANCE.

TO THE DEFAULT, ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF AN INSURED. SURETY IS GENERALLY PROVIDED

FOR CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE, LEGAL MATTERS SUCH AS APPEALS, TRUSTEES IN

BANKRUPTCY AND PROBATE AND OTHER PERFORMANCE BONDS. THIS PRODUCT LINE INCLUDES

SURETY BUSINESS WRITTEN IN THE COMPANYS FOLLOWING SUBSIDIARIES: ST. PAUL

GUARANTEE (CANADA), AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES (MEXICO) AND ST. PAUL TRAVELERS

CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY OF EUROPE (UNITED KINGDOM).

WORKERS COMPENSATION

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYERS FOR

SPECIFIED BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW FOR WORKPLACE INJURIES TO

EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE TYPICALLY FOUR TYPES OF BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER WORKERS

COMPENSATION POLICIES: MEDICAL BENEFITS, DISABILITY BENEFITS, DEATH BENEFITS

AND VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION BENEFITS. THE COMPANY EMPHASIZES MANAGED CARE

COST CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES, WHICH INVOLVE EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES AND CARE

PROVIDERS IN A COOPERATIVE EFFORT THAT FOCUSES ON THE INJURED EMPLOYEES EARLY

RETURN TO WORK, COST-EFFECTIVE, QUALITY CARE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THIS

MARKET.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR BUSINESSES AGAINST

LOSSES INCURRED FROM PERSONAL BODILY INJURY, BODILY INJURY TO THIRD PARTIES,

PROPERTY DAMAGE TO AN INSUREDS VEHICLE, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE TO OTHER VEHICLES

AND OTHER PROPERTY RESULTING FROM THE OWNERSHIP, MAINTENANCE OR USE OF

AUTOMOBILES AND TRUCKS IN A BUSINESS.

9

PROPERTY

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE TO BUILDINGS, INVENTORY AND

EQUIPMENT FROM NATURAL DISASTERS, INCLUDING HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS,

EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, AND SEVERE WINTER WEATHER. ALSO COVERED ARE MANMADE EVENTS

TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION RESULTING FROM COVERED PROPERTY DAMAGE. FOR ADDITIONAL

ACT OF 2002. PROPERTY ALSO INCLUDES OCEAN AND INLAND MARINE INSURANCE, WHICH

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR GOODS IN TRANSIT, AND UNIQUE ONE-OF-A-KIND EXPOSURES.

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY AND

LIABILITY COVERAGE. PROPERTY INSURANCE COVERS DAMAGES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY

FIRE, WIND, HAIL, WATER, THEFT AND VANDALISM, AND PROTECTS BUSINESSES FROM

FINANCIAL LOSS DUE TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION RESULTING FROM A COVERED LOSS.

LIABILITY COVERAGE INSURES BUSINESSES AGAINST THIRD PARTIES FROM ACCIDENTS

OCCURRING ON THEIR PREMISES OR ARISING OUT OF THEIR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS

INJURIES SUSTAINED FROM PRODUCTS SOLD.

INTERNATIONAL

PROVIDES COVERAGE PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, AND AT LLOYDS. THE COVERAGE

PROVIDED IN THOSE MARKETS INCLUDES EMPLOYERS LIABILITY (SIMILAR TO WORKERS

COMPENSATION COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES), PUBLIC AND PRODUCT LIABILITY (THE

EQUIVALENT OF GENERAL LIABILITY), PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY (SIMILAR TO DIRECTORS

AND OFFICERS OR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COVERAGES), MOTOR (SIMILAR TO AUTOMOBILE

COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES) AND PROPERTY. WHILE THE COVERED HAZARD MAY BE SIMILAR

TO THOSE IN THE U.S. MARKET, THE DIFFERENT LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS CAN MAKE THE

PRODUCT RISKS AND COVERAGE TERMS POTENTIALLY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THE

UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONAL DOES NOT INCLUDE SURETY BUSINESS WRITTEN IN THE

COMPANYS CANADIAN, MEXICAN OR UNITED KINGDOM SUBSIDIARIES.

PRINCIPAL MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION

PERSONAL

PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 7,800 INDEPENDENT

AGENTS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, SUPPORTED BY PERSONNEL IN ELEVEN

MARKETING REGIONS, THREE SINGLE STATE COMPANIES AND SIX BUSINESS SERVICE

CENTERS. IN SELECTING NEW INDEPENDENT AGENCIES TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS,

PERSONAL CONSIDERS EACH AGENCYS PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL STABILITY, STAFF

EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH PERSONALS OPERATING AND MARKETING PLANS.

ONCE AN AGENCY IS APPOINTED, PERSONAL CAREFULLY MONITORS ITS PERFORMANCE. WHILE

THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS FOR PERSONALS INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE IN STATES ALONG THE

EAST COAST, IN THE SOUTH AND TEXAS, PERSONAL IS EXPANDING ITS GEOGRAPHIC

PRESENCE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

PERSONAL

OPERATES SINGLE STATE COMPANIES IN MASSACHUSETTS, NEW JERSEY AND FLORIDA WITH

PRODUCTS MARKETED PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS. THESE STATES

REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 19% OF PERSONAL DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005. THE

COMPANIES WERE ESTABLISHED TO MANAGE COMPLEX MARKETS IN MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW

JERSEY AND PROPERTY CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE IN FLORIDA. EACH COMPANY HAS DEDICATED

RESOURCES IN UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, FINANCE, LEGAL AND SERVICE FUNCTIONS.

PERSONAL

USES A CONSISTENT OPERATING MODEL WITH AGENTS OUTSIDE OF THE SINGLE STATE

COMPANIES (SEE DISCUSSION ABOVE). THE MODEL PROVIDES TECHNOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES

TO AGENTS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR EASE OF DOING BUSINESS. PERSONAL AGENTS QUOTE AND

ISSUE APPROXIMATELY 98% OF PERSONALS POLICIES DIRECTLY FROM THEIR AGENCIES BY

LEVERAGING EITHER THEIR OWN AGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR USING PERSONALS

PROPRIETARY QUOTE AND ISSUANCE SYSTEMS WHICH ALLOWS AGENTS TO RATE, QUOTE AND

ISSUE POLICIES ON LINE. ALL OF THESE QUOTE AND ISSUE PLATFORMS INTERFACE WITH

PERSONALS UNDERWRITING AND RATING SYSTEMS, WHICH EDIT TRANSACTIONS FOR COMPLIANCE

WITH PERSONALS UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PROGRAMS. BUSINESS PROCESSED BY AGENTS

ON THESE PLATFORMS IS SUBJECT TO CONSULTATIVE REVIEW BY PERSONALS IN-HOUSE

UNDERWRITERS. PERSONAL ALSO PROVIDES A DOWNLOAD CAPABILITY THAT REFRESHES THE

INDIVIDUAL AGENCY SYSTEM DATABASES OF APPROXIMATELY 4,800 AGENTS EACH DAY WITH

UPDATED POLICY INFORMATION.

PERSONAL

CONTINUES TO DEVELOP FUNCTIONALITY TO PROVIDE ITS AGENTS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE

ARRAY OF ONLINE SERVICE CAPABILITIES PACKAGED TOGETHER IN AN EASY-TO-USE AGENCY

SERVICE PORTAL, INCLUDING CUSTOMER SERVICE, MARKETING AND CLAIM FUNCTIONALITY.

AGENCIES CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO SHIFT THE ONGOING CORE SERVICE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

PERSONALS CUSTOMERS TO ONE OF THE COMPANYS FOUR CUSTOMER CARE CENTERS, WHERE

THE COMPANY RENDERS CUSTOMER SERVICE ON BEHALF OF AN AGENCY BY PROVIDING A

COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF DIRECT CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS, INCLUDING RESPONSE TO

BILLING AND COVERAGE INQUIRIES, AND POLICY CHANGES. APPROXIMATELY 1,190 AGENTS

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SERVICE ALTERNATIVE.

PERSONAL

ALSO MARKETS THROUGH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INCLUDING SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS EMPLOYERS AND CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS, AND JOINT MARKETING

ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER INSURERS. PERSONAL HANDLES THE SALES AND SERVICE FOR

THESE PROGRAMS EITHER THROUGH A SPONSORING INDEPENDENT AGENT OR THROUGH TWO OF

THE COMPANYS CALL CENTER LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY IS ONE OF THE LEADING

PROVIDERS OF PERSONAL LINES PRODUCTS TO MEMBERS OF AFFINITY GROUPS. A NUMBER OF

WELL-KNOWN CORPORATIONS MAKE AVAILABLE THE COMPANYS PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO THEIR

EMPLOYEES PRIMARILY THROUGH A PAYROLL DEDUCTION PAYMENT PROCESS. THE COMPANY

HAS SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE

ASSOCIATION (AAA) CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER AFFINITY GROUPS THAT

MAKE AVAILABLE PERSONALS PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO THEIR MEMBERS. SINCE 1995, THE

COMPANY HAS HAD A MARKETING AGREEMENT WITH GEICO TO UNDERWRITE HOMEOWNERS

BUSINESS FOR THEIR AUTO CUSTOMERS. THIS AGREEMENT HAS ADDED PROFITABLE BUSINESS

AND HELPED TO GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSIFY THE HOMEOWNERS LINE OF BUSINESS.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING

LEVELS FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY

DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN EXPECTATION OF ESTIMATED LOSSES, THE EXPENSE OF

PRODUCING, ISSUING AND SERVICING THE BUSINESS AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR

PROFIT AND CONTINGENCIES. THE COMPANY HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO

UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES PROFITABLE GROWTH RATHER THAN

PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE.

11

PERSONAL

HAS DEVELOPED A PRODUCT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT INTEGRATES THE DISCIPLINES

OF UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THIS APPROACH IS

DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING DISCIPLINE AND PRICING

SEGMENTATION. PROPRIETARY DATA IS ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO PERSONALS BUSINESS

OVER MANY YEARS. PERSONAL USES A VARIETY OF PROPRIETARY AND VENDOR PRODUCED

RISK DIFFERENTIATION MODELS TO FACILITATE ITS PRICING SEGMENTATION. PERSONALS PRODUCT

MANAGERS ESTABLISH STRICT UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES INTEGRATED WITH ITS FILED

PRICING AND RATING PLANS, WHICH ENABLE PERSONAL TO STREAMLINE ITS RISK

SELECTION AND PRICING PROCESSES.

PRICING

FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE IS DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF

CLAIMS AND BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF AUTOMOBILE REPAIRS, MEDICAL CARE AND

LITIGATION OF LIABILITY CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS

IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON PROMPTLY IDENTIFYING AND RECTIFYING DISPARITIES BETWEEN

PREMIUM LEVELS AND PROJECTED CLAIM COSTS, AND OBTAINING APPROVAL FROM STATE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WHEN NECESSARY FOR FILED RATE CHANGES.

PRICING

IN THE HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS IS ALSO DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS

AND BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF BUILDING SUPPLIES, LABOR AND HOUSEHOLD

POSSESSIONS. MOST HOMEOWNERS POLICIES OFFER, BUT DO NOT REQUIRE, AUTOMATIC

INCREASES IN COVERAGE TO REFLECT GROWTH IN REPLACEMENT COSTS AND PROPERTY

VALUES. IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY MULTIPLE PERIL

COVERAGE, THE PROFITABILITY AND PRICING OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IS AFFECTED BY

THE INCIDENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO WEATHER AND

EARTHQUAKES. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES,

PERSONAL LIMITS THE WRITING OF NEW HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS AND SELECTIVELY TAKES

UNDERWRITING ACTION ON EXISTING BUSINESS IN SOME MARKETS. IN ADDITION,

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED, PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN

IMPLEMENTED IN SOME CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS, AND DEDUCTIBLES ARE IN PLACE IN

HURRICANE AND WIND AND HAIL PRONE AREAS. PERSONAL USES COMPUTER-MODELING

TECHNIQUES TO ASSESS ITS LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE

CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS. CHANGES TO METHODS OF MARKETING AND UNDERWRITING IN

SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO STATE-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, WHICH CAN MAKE IT

MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN INSURER TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES.

INSURERS

WRITING PERSONAL LINES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES MAY BE UNABLE TO INCREASE

PRICES UNTIL SOME TIME AFTER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COVERAGE HAVE INCREASED,

PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF STATE INSURANCE RATE REGULATION. THE PACE AT WHICH AN

INSURER CAN CHANGE RATES IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED COSTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON

WHETHER THE APPLICABLE STATE LAW REQUIRES PRIOR APPROVAL OF RATE INCREASES OR

NOTIFICATION TO THE REGULATOR EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER A RATE CHANGE IS IMPOSED.

IN STATES WITH PRIOR APPROVAL LAWS, RATES MUST BE APPROVED BY THE REGULATOR

BEFORE BEING USED BY THE INSURER. IN STATES HAVING FILE-AND-USE LAWS, THE

INSURER MUST FILE RATE CHANGES WITH THE REGULATOR, BUT DOES NOT NEED TO WAIT

FOR APPROVAL BEFORE USING THE NEW RATES. A USE-AND-FILE LAW REQUIRES AN

INSURER TO FILE RATES WITHIN A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE INSURER BEGINS USING

THE NEW RATE. APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE STATES REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL OF

MOST RATE CHANGES.

INDEPENDENT

AGENTS EITHER SUBMIT APPLICATIONS TO THE COMPANYS SERVICE CENTERS FOR

UNDERWRITING REVIEW, QUOTE, AND ISSUANCE OR THEY UTILIZE ONE OF ITS AUTOMATED

QUOTE AND ISSUE SYSTEMS. AUTOMATED TRANSACTIONS ARE EDITED BY THE COMPANYS

SYSTEMS AND ISSUED IF THEY CONFORM TO ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. EXCEPTIONS ARE

REVIEWED BY UNDERWRITERS IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS CENTERS. AUDITS ARE

CONDUCTED BY BUSINESS CENTER UNDERWRITERS AND AGENCY MANAGERS, ON A SYSTEMATIC

SAMPLING BASIS, ACROSS ALL OF THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT AGENCY GENERATED

BUSINESS. EACH AGENT IS ASSIGNED TO A SPECIFIC EMPLOYEE OR TEAM OF EMPLOYEES

RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THE AGENT ON BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING,

PRODUCT LINES

THE

PRIMARY COVERAGES IN PERSONAL ARE PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE

SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS. PERSONAL HAD APPROXIMATELY 6.6 MILLION POLICIES IN FORCE

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY TO OTHERS

FOR BOTH BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE AND FOR PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO AN

INSUREDS OWN VEHICLE FROM COLLISION AND VARIOUS OTHER PERILS. IN ADDITION,

MANY STATES REQUIRE POLICIES TO PROVIDE FIRST-PARTY PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION,

FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AS NO-FAULT COVERAGE.

12

HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER

PROVIDES PROTECTION AGAINST LOSSES TO

DWELLINGS AND CONTENTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF PERILS, AS WELL AS COVERAGE FOR

LIABILITY ARISING FROM OWNERSHIP OR OCCUPANCY. THE COMPANY WRITES HOMEOWNERS

INSURANCE FOR DWELLINGS, CONDOMINIUMS AND RENTAL PROPERTY CONTENTS. THE COMPANY

ALSO WRITES COVERAGE FOR PERSONAL WATERCRAFT, PERSONAL ARTICLES SUCH AS

JEWELRY, AND UMBRELLA LIABILITY PROTECTION.

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

THE

COMPANYS CLAIMS MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH ITS FOCUS ON OPTIMIZING CLAIM

OUTCOMES, COST EFFICIENCY AND SERVICE ARE CRITICAL TO THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

GROW PROFITABLY AND REFLECT THESE CORE TENETS.



FAIR, EFFICIENT, FACT-BASED CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

CONTROLS LOSSES FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS CUSTOMERS;



USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES

FRONT-LINE CLAIM PROFESSIONALS WITH NECESSARY INFORMATION AND FACILITATES

PROMPT CLAIM RESOLUTION;



SPECIALIZATION OF CLAIM PROFESSIONALS AND

SEGMENTATION OF CLAIMS BY COMPLEXITY, AS INDICATED BY SEVERITY, COVERAGE AND

CAUSATION, ALLOW THE COMPANY TO FOCUS ITS RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY;



EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION, USING MEANINGFUL

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, ACROSS ALL DIVISIONS WITHIN THE COMPANY FACILITATES

PRODUCT ANALYSIS AND ENHANCES RISK SELECTION AND RISK PRICING; AND



EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE ENHANCES CUSTOMER

RETENTION.

THE

COMPANYS CLAIMS FUNCTION IS MANAGED THROUGH ITS CLAIM SERVICES OPERATIONS.

WITH NEARLY 13,000 EMPLOYEES, CLAIM SERVICES EMPLOYS A DIVERSE GROUP OF

PROFESSIONALS, INCLUDING CLAIM ADJUSTERS, APPRAISERS, ATTORNEYS, INVESTIGATORS,

ENGINEERS, ACCOUNTANTS, SYSTEM SPECIALISTS AND TRAINING, MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT

PERSONNEL. APPROVED EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS INDEPENDENT ADJUSTERS

AND APPRAISERS, INVESTIGATORS AND ATTORNEYS, ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE AS

APPROPRIATE.

13

FIELD

CLAIM MANAGEMENT TEAMS LOCATED IN 32 CLAIM CENTERS AND 89 SATELLITE AND

SPECIALTY-ONLY OFFICES IN 49 STATES ARE ORGANIZED TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE

SPECIFIC CLAIM CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE TO THE BUSINESSES WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL,

SPECIALTY AND PERSONAL SEGMENTS. CLAIM TEAMS WITH SPECIALIZED SKILLS,

RESOURCES, AND WORKFLOWS ARE MATCHED TO THE UNIQUE EXPOSURES OF THOSE

BUSINESSES WITH LOCAL CLAIM MANAGEMENT DEDICATED TO ACHIEVING OPTIMAL RESULTS

WITHIN EACH SEGMENT. THE COMPANYS HOME OFFICE OPERATIONS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF WORKFLOW DESIGN, QUALITY MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCED MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS, TRAINING,

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONTROL, AND HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY. IN ADDITION TO

THE FIELD TEAMS, CLAIM STAFF IS DEDICATED TO EACH OF PERSONALS SINGLE STATE

COMPANIES IN FLORIDA, MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW JERSEY. THIS STRUCTURE PERMITS THE

COMPANY TO MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF A LARGER, ESTABLISHED COMPANY

WHILE RETAINING THE AGILITY TO RESPOND PROMPTLY TO THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS,

BROKERS, AGENTS AND UNDERWRITERS.

AN

INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANYS STRATEGY TO BENEFIT CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS

IS ITS CONTINUING INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INSURANCE FRAUD

THROUGH ITS INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES UNIT. THE COMPANY HAS A NATIONWIDE STAFF OF

EXPERTS THAT INVESTIGATE A WIDE ARRAY OF INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEMES USING IN-HOUSE

FORENSIC RESOURCES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS. THIS STAFF ALSO HAS SPECIALIZED

EXPERTISE IN FIRE SCENE EXAMINATIONS, MEDICAL PROVIDER FRAUD SCHEMES AND DATA

MINING. THE COMPANY ALSO DEDICATES INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT

VIOLATIONS OF LAW ARE REPORTED TO AND PROSECUTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

CLAIM

SERVICES USES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, AND DATA ANALYSIS TO

ASSIST THE COMPANY IN REVIEWING ITS CLAIM PRACTICES AND RESULTS TO EVALUATE AND

IMPROVE ITS PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANYS CLAIM MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON

SEGMENTATION OF CLAIMS AND APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL SPECIALIZATION TO DRIVE

EFFECTIVE CLAIM RESOLUTION. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS INVESTMENT IN

CLAIM RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE FOCUS ON CLAIM OUTCOMES AND A

DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT. IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS

INVESTED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN MANY OF ITS  CLAIM HANDLING OPERATIONS AND ROUTINELY

MONITORS THE EFFECT OF ITS INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE A CONSISTENT OPTIMIZATION

BETWEEN OUTCOMES, COST, AND SERVICE.

THE

COMPANYS PROVEN CATASTROPHE RESPONSE STRATEGY AND ITS CATASTROPHE CLAIM

HANDLING TEAMS WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN ITS RESPONSE TO A VARIETY OF

WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES THAT IMPACTED THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN BOTH 2005 AND

2004, INCLUDING HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA AND WILMA (2005), AND HURRICANES

CHARLEY, FRANCES, IVAN AND JEANNE (2004).

THE

COMPANY IS ALSO A LEADER IN BRINGING EFFECTIVE CLAIM SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE

SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS

CONCIERGE

CLAIM

TH

,

A NEW WORRY-FREE AUTO CLAIM SERVICE THAT FEATURES SELECT AUTO REPAIR FACILITIES

WITH COMPANY APPRAISERS ON SITE TO COMPLETE AN ESTIMATE, HANDLE ALL RENTAL

ARRANGEMENTS AND MONITOR THE REPAIR PROCESS FROM START TO FINISH. BY MANAGING

THE CLAIM IN THIS WAY, THE COMPANY CAN HELP ENSURE PROMPT, QUALITY RESULTS AND CREATE

A DIFFERENTIATED, SUPERIOR CLAIM EXPERIENCE FOR CUSTOMERS.

ANOTHER

STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IS TRAVCOMP

TH

,

A WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIM RESOLUTION AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT

ASSISTS ADJUSTERS IN THE PROMPT INVESTIGATION AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS. INNOVATIVE MEDICAL AND CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

TECHNOLOGIES PERMIT NURSE, MEDICAL AND CLAIMS PROFESSIONALS TO SHARE

APPROPRIATE VITAL INFORMATION THAT SUPPORTS PROMPT INVESTIGATION, EFFECTIVE

RETURN TO WORK AND CLAIM RESOLUTION STRATEGIES. THESE TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER

WITH EFFECTIVE MATCHING OF PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND AUTHORITY TO SPECIFIC CLAIM

ISSUES, HAVE RESULTED IN MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION

CLAIMS WITH LOWER MEDICAL, WAGE REPLACEMENT COSTS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

REINSURANCE

THE

COMPANY REINSURES A PORTION OF THE RISKS IT UNDERWRITES IN ORDER TO CONTROL ITS

EXPOSURE TO LOSSES AND PROTECT CAPITAL RESOURCES. THE COMPANY CEDES TO

REINSURERS A PORTION OF THESE RISKS AND PAYS PREMIUMS BASED UPON THE RISK AND

EXPOSURE OF THE POLICIES SUBJECT TO SUCH REINSURANCE. CEDED REINSURANCE

INVOLVES CREDIT RISK, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO MANDATORY POOLS, AND IS GENERALLY

SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO THE

COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF THE REINSURANCE CEDED, THE COMPANY REMAINS LIABLE AS

THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE

REPORTED AFTER REDUCTIONS FOR KNOWN INSOLVENCIES AND AFTER ALLOWANCES FOR

UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS COLLATERAL, INCLUDING TRUST

AGREEMENTS, ESCROW FUNDS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, UNDER CERTAIN REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF REINSURERS ON AN

ONGOING BASIS AND REVIEWS ITS REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS PERIODICALLY. REINSURERS

ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND THE

PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING

REINSURANCE, SEE NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

14

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO

LARGE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY LOSSES, INCLUDING.



FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE

IS PROVIDED FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE INSURANCE PROVIDED BY A SINGLE POLICY

AND EACH POLICY REINSURED IS SEPARATELY NEGOTIATED;



TREATY REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE IS

PROVIDED FOR A SPECIFIED TYPE OR CATEGORY OF RISKS; AND



CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE, IN WHICH THE COMPANY

IS INDEMNIFIED FOR AN AMOUNT OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED RETENTION WITH

RESPECT TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM A CATASTROPHIC EVENT.

SECOND HIGHEST OF 16 RATINGS

IN

NOVEMBER 2005, THE SWISS RE GROUP ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD AGREED TO ACQUIRE GE

INSURANCE SOLUTIONS, THE FIFTH LARGEST REINSURER WORLDWIDE, FROM GENERAL

ELECTRIC COMPANY. UPON EXPECTED CONSUMMATION OF THIS TRANSACTION IN MID-2006,

THE SWISS RE GROUP WOULD BECOME THE COMPANYS LARGEST REINSURER GROUP WITH

RECOVERABLES OF $1.69 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. CONSEQUENTLY, THE XL

CAPITAL GROUP IS EXPECTED TO BECOME THE COMPANYS FIFTH LARGEST REINSURER GROUP

WITH RECOVERABLES OF $651 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD $19.57 BILLION IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES.

OF THIS AMOUNT, $2.21 BILLION WAS FOR MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS THAT

RELATE PRIMARILY TO WORKERS COMPENSATION SERVICE BUSINESS AND HAVE THE

OBLIGATION OF THE PARTICIPATING INSURANCE COMPANIES ON A JOINT AND SEVERAL

BASIS SUPPORTING THESE CESSIONS. AN ADDITIONAL $3.99 BILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS RELATING PRIMARILY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, FOR

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN

THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COMPANIES ISSUING THE ANNUITIES. OF THE REMAINING

$13.37 BILLION OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, $1.20 BILLION

WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, AND THE REMAINDER

PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED REINSURANCE IN SUPPORT OF ONGOING AND RUNOFF BUSINESS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, $2.40 BILLION OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES WERE

COLLATERALIZED BY LETTERS OF CREDIT, TRUST AGREEMENTS AND ESCROW FUNDS. ALSO AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES OF $804 MILLION.

FOR

A DESCRIPTION OF REINSURANCE-RELATED LITIGATION, SEE ITEM 3, LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

CURRENT NET RETENTION POLICY

THE

DESCRIPTIONS BELOW RELATE TO THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN EFFECT

AT JANUARY 1, 2006. MOST PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS HAVE TERRORISM

SUBLIMITS OR EXCLUSIONS. FOR THIRD PARTY LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL LIMITS THE NET

RETENTION TO A MAXIMUM OF $8 MILLION PER INSURED, PER OCCURRENCE AFTER

REINSURANCE. FOR THIRD PARTY LIABILITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO UMBRELLA

LIABILITY, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY, AND

EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY, SPECIALTY GENERALLY LIMITS THE NET RETENTIONS

TO $16 MILLION PER POLICY AFTER REINSURANCE. THE NET RETAINED AMOUNT PER RISK

FOR COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY PROPERTY IS LIMITED TO $15 MILLION, AFTER

REINSURANCE. FOR SURETY PROTECTION, THE COMPANY GENERALLY RETAINS UP TO $24.5

MILLION PROBABLE MAXIMUM LOSS (PML) PER PRINCIPAL BUT MAY RETAIN HIGHER AMOUNTS

BASED ON THE TYPE OF OBLIGATION, CREDIT QUALITY AND OTHER CREDIT RISK FACTORS.

PERSONAL RETAINS THE FIRST $5 MILLION OF UMBRELLA POLICIES AND PURCHASES

FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE FOR LIMITS OVER $5 MILLION. FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY

INSURANCE, THERE IS A $6 MILLION MAXIMUM RETENTION PER RISK. THE COMPANY ALSO

UTILIZES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIMITS CAPACITY OR TO

REDUCE RETENTIONS ON AN INDIVIDUAL RISK BASIS. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO RETAIN

AMOUNTS GREATER THAN THOSE DESCRIBED HEREIN BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RISK.

15

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH NONAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO

MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM ONE OCCURRENCE. FOR THE

ACCUMULATION OF NET PROPERTY LOSSES ARISING OUT OF ONE OCCURRENCE, THE GENERAL

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY COVERS 70% OR $875 MILLION OF TOTAL LOSSES

BETWEEN $750 MILLION AND $2 BILLION. THIS AGREEMENT EXCLUDES NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL,

BIOCHEMICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL LOSSES FOR DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND ALL TERRORISM

LOSSES AS DEFINED BY THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 AND THE TERRORISM

RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005. THIS AGREEMENT COVERS ALL OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS EXCEPT THAT BUSINESS WRITTEN BY ST PAUL TRAVELERS INSURANCE

COMPANY LIMITED. FOR BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, REPUBLIC OF

IRELAND AND IN THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, SEPARATE REINSURANCE

PROTECTIONS ARE PURCHASED LOCALLY WHICH HAVE LOWER NET RETENTIONS MORE

COMMENSURATE WITH THE SIZE OF THE RESPECTIVE LOCAL BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY

CONDUCTS AN ONGOING REVIEW OF ITS RISK AND CATASTROPHE COVERAGES AND MAKES

CHANGES AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD COVERAGE FOR ONE ADDITIONAL LIMIT UNDER ITS

GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY, THE TERM OF WHICH RUNS TO JUNE 30,

2006.

IN PART AS A RESULT OF THE SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS IN

2005 AND 2004, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE COST OF REINSURANCE TO INCREASE, AND

THERE MAY BE REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE COVERAGE.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 AND TERRORISM

RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, THE

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 (THE TERRORISM ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO

FEDERAL LAW AND ESTABLISHED THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM),

A TEMPORARY FEDERAL PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THAT PROVIDED

FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR INSURED LOSSES

RESULTING FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN

INTEREST. THE PROGRAM WAS SCHEDULED TO TERMINATE ON DECEMBER 31, 2005.  ON

DECEMBER 22, 2005, THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005 (THE

TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW, REAUTHORIZING THE

PROGRAM THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2007, WHILE REDUCING THE FEDERAL ROLE UNDER THE

PROGRAM. IN ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES),

THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS THAT VARY BY

PROGRAM YEAR OF AMOUNTS $100 MILLION OR LESS, AND MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN

EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE

TREASURY. THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION CERTAIN OF THE

FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE: FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE, PRIVATE MORTGAGE

INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE, HEALTH

OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD INSURANCE, AND REINSURANCE. THE TERRORISM EXTENSION

ACT EXEMPTED FROM COVERAGE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL TYPES OF INSURANCE, INCLUDING

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY (OTHER THAN DIRECTORS AND

OFFICERS), SURETY, BURGLARY AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS MULTI-PERIL.  IN

THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE

COVERED BY THE TERRORISM ACT AND THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT. BOTH ACTS

GENERALLY REQUIRE THAT ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN

THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A

PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

FOR A PERCENTAGE OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN

ANNUAL CAP.  THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT PERCENTAGE REMAINS AT 90% FOR 2006,

BUT DECREASES TO 85% IN 2007.  IN EACH CASE, THE DEDUCTIBLE IS CALCULATED

BY APPLYING THE DEDUCTIBLE PERCENTAGE TO THE INSURERS DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS

FOR COVERED LINES FROM THE CALENDAR YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE

YEAR. THE DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM WAS 7% FOR 2003, 10% FOR 2004 AND 15%

FOR 2005, AND WILL BE 17.5% FOR 2006 AND 20% FOR 2007.  THE COMPANYS

ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS $1.91 BILLION FOR 2006.  THE

ANNUAL CAP LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING

INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE $100 BILLION

AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE

U.S. TREASURY AND AN INSURER THAT HAS MET ITS DEDUCTIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM YEAR

IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES (OR PORTION THEREOF) THAT EXCEED THE $100 BILLION

CAP. THE COMPANY HAD NO TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES IN 2005, 2004 OR 2003.

FLORIDA REINSURANCE FUND

THE

COMPANY ALSO PARTICIPATES IN THE FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND (FHCF),

WHICH IS A STATE-MANDATED CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE FUND THAT WILL PROVIDE

REIMBURSEMENT TO INSURERS FOR A PORTION OF THEIR RESIDENTIAL CATASTROPHIC

HURRICANE LOSSES. THE FHCF IS PRIMARILY FUNDED BY PREMIUMS FROM INSURANCE

COMPANIES THAT WRITE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY BUSINESS IN FLORIDA AND, IF

INSUFFICIENT, ASSESSMENTS ON ALL FLORIDA

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY LINES OF BUSINESS, EXCLUDING ACCIDENT AND HEALTH,

THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM, WORKERS COMPENSATION, AND MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE INSURANCE. THE FHCFS RESOURCES ARE LIMITED TO THESE CONTRIBUTIONS

AND TO ITS BORROWING CAPACITY AT THE TIME OF A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE IN

FLORIDA. BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTED REIMBURSEMENTS FOR 2004 AND 2005 LOSSES, IT

IS EXPECTED THAT THE FHCF WILL BE ABLE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT LEVYING

ASSESSMENTS. HOWEVER, IF THERE IS FUTURE SUBSEQUENT LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON THE

FHCFS SHARE OF THE 2004 AND 2005 HURRICANE LOSSES OR ADDITIONAL HURRICANES IN

2006, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE CASH RESOURCES OF THE FHCF WILL BE

SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS MAY BE NECESSARY.

16

RESERVES

CLAIM

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR

CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET

REPORTED.

MANAGEMENT

CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS THAT

INCLUDES REVIEW OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS, UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. IN ESTABLISHING

RESERVES, THE COMPANY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FOR REINSURANCE,

SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION. THE RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED REGULARLY BY A

QUALIFIED ACTUARY EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY.

FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING RESERVES AND A DISCUSSION

OF UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND RISK FACTORS, SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND

REQUIRES THE CONSIDERATION OF A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES (DISCUSSED

BY PRODUCT LINE IN THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION) ARE AFFECTED BY

BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING

PROCEDURES, INFLATION, JUDICIAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS.

THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES

ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE UNDERLYING

INSURANCE CONTRACT (E.G., CLAIMS MADE VERSUS OCCURRENCE), CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE

VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, DETERMINING THE

OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM, AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE

OCCURRENCE OF THE INSURED EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE

INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

THE

COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES FOR UNREPORTED CLAIMS AND DEVELOPMENT ON REPORTED

CLAIMS PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF LOSS

DEVELOPMENT BY ACCIDENT YEAR FOR EACH TYPE OF EXPOSURE AND BUSINESS UNIT.

SIMILARLY, THE COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES OF UNPAID LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS OF THE

RELATIONSHIP OF LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO LOSSES FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS

AND TYPE OF EXPOSURE. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANYS RESERVING METHODS FOR

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE ITEM 7ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION,

AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

DISCOUNTING

INCLUDED

IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET ARE CERTAIN RESERVES DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE

PAYMENTS. THE LIABILITIES FOR LOSSES FOR SOME LONG-TERM DISABILITY PAYMENTS

UNDER WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION EXCESS

INSURANCE, WHICH TOTALED $1.92 BILLION AND $1.99 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND A RANGE OF RATES FROM 3.5% TO 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. RESERVES RELATED TO

CERTAIN FIXED AND DETERMINABLE ASBESTOS-RELATED SETTLEMENTS, WHERE ALL PAYMENT

AMOUNTS AND THEIR TIMING ARE KNOWN, TOTALED $34 MILLION AND $67 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESERVES WERE DISCOUNTED USING

A RATE OF 2.6% AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND AT A RANGE OF RATES FROM 2.3% TO 2.6%

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. RESERVES FOR CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS WERE

DISCOUNTED USING A RANGE OF RATES FROM 5% TO 7.5%, AND TOTALED $79 MILLION AND

$126 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER FACTORS

THE

TABLE ON PAGE 21 SETS FORTH THE YEAR-END RESERVES FROM 1995 THROUGH 2005 AND

THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THOSE RESERVES, PRESENTED ON A HISTORICAL BASIS. THE

ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND REESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE

TABLE FOR THE YEARS 1995 THROUGH 2003 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE

ACQUISITION OF SPC IN 2004. THE TABLE INCLUDES SPC RESERVES BEGINNING AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004.

17

THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND REESTIMATED

RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR THE YEARS

1995 TO 2000

HAVE ALSO NOT

BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE ACQUISITION OF NORTHLAND AND COMMERCIAL GUARANTY

CASUALTY, AND THE YEAR 1995 IN THE TABLE HAS NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE

ACQUISITION OF AETNAS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.

BEGINNING IN 1996 AND 2001, THE TABLE INCLUDES THE RESERVE ACTIVITY OF AETNAS

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, AND NORTHLAND AND COMMERCIAL

GUARANTY CASUALTY, RESPECTIVELY. THE DATA IN THE TABLE IS PRESENTED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC). CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO AVOID MISINTERPRETATION BY THOSE

UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS INFORMATION OR FAMILIAR WITH OTHER DATA COMMONLY REPORTED

BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE ACCOMPANYING DATA IS NOT ACCIDENT YEAR DATA, BUT

RATHER A DISPLAY OF 1995 TO 2005 YEAR-END RESERVES AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES

IN THOSE RESERVES.

FOR

INSTANCE, THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY OR REDUNDANCY SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING

TABLE FOR EACH YEAR REPRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT BY WHICH ORIGINAL ESTIMATES

OF RESERVES AS OF THAT YEAR END HAVE CHANGED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. ACCORDINGLY,

THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY FOR A YEAR RELATES ONLY TO RESERVES AT THAT YEAR-END

AND THOSE AMOUNTS ARE NOT ADDITIVE. EXPRESSED ANOTHER WAY, IF THE ORIGINAL

RESERVES AT THE END OF 1995 INCLUDED $4 MILLION FOR A LOSS THAT IS FINALLY PAID

IN 2005 FOR $5 MILLION, THE $1 MILLION DEFICIENCY (THE EXCESS OF THE ACTUAL

PAYMENT OF $5 MILLION OVER THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF $4 MILLION) WOULD BE

INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES IN EACH OF THE YEARS 1995 TO 2004 SHOWN

IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

VARIOUS

FACTORS MAY DISTORT THE RE-ESTIMATED RESERVES AND CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY OR

REDUNDANCY SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION

OF THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE ARISE FROM

CLAIMS ON POLICIES WRITTEN PRIOR TO THE MID-1970S INVOLVING LIABILITY EXPOSURES

SUCH AS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN THE POST-1984 PERIOD, THE COMPANY

HAS DEVELOPED MORE STRINGENT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND POLICY EXCLUSIONS AND

HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRACTED OR TERMINATED THE WRITING OF THESE RISKS. SEE

ITEM 7ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE DEVELOPMENT

OF THESE LIABILITIES IN THE PAST WILL NOT NECESSARILY RECUR IN THE FUTURE.

OTHER

FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE DATA IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE INCLUDE THE DISCOUNTING

OF CERTAIN RESERVES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, AND THE USE OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED

INSURANCE POLICIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WORKERS COMPENSATION INDEMNITY RESERVES

(TABULAR RESERVES) ARE DISCOUNTED TO REFLECT THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. APPARENT

DEFICIENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AS THE DISCOUNT ON THESE WORKERS

COMPENSATION RESERVES IS ACCRETED AT THE APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATES. ALSO, A

PORTION OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN WITH RETROSPECTIVELY

RATED INSURANCE POLICIES IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE LOSS EXPERIENCE IS PRIMARILY

BORNE BY THE INSURED. FOR THIS BUSINESS, INCREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN

AN INCREASE IN RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING INCREASE IN AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM

INSUREDS. LIKEWISE, DECREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN A DECREASE IN

RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING DECREASE IN AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM THESE INSUREDS.

THE AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON THESE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES MITIGATE THE

IMPACT OF THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES OR REDUNDANCIES ON THE COMPANYS EARNINGS

BUT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

BECAUSE

OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL

EXTRAPOLATION OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REDUNDANCIES OR DEFICIENCIES IN LOSS RESERVES

FROM THE DATA IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

THE

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RESERVES, NET OF REINSURANCE, FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE, WHICH IS PREPARED IN

ACCORDANCE U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THOSE REPORTED IN

THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORTS FILED WITH INSURANCE REGULATORS, WHICH ARE

PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES, WERE $(296)

MILLION, $(282) MILLION AND $26 MILLION FOR 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE IN THE DIFFERENCES IN 2005 AND 2004 COMPARED WITH THE DIFFERENCE

IN 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF A REINSURANCE CONTRACT WHICH THE

COMPANY ENTERED INTO IN 2004 THAT PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS.

INTERCOMPANY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

MOST

OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE MEMBERS OF INTERCOMPANY PROPERTY

AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS. POOLING ARRANGEMENTS PERMIT THE

PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO RELY ON THE CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE POOLS CAPITAL

AND SURPLUS RATHER THAN JUST ON ITS OWN CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. UNDER SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS, THE MEMBERS SHARE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INSURANCE BUSINESS THAT IS

WRITTEN, AND ALLOCATE THE COMBINED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES. DURING 2005,

THE COMPANY COMBINED THE PREVIOUSLY SEPARATE ST. PAUL INSURANCE GROUP AND

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY POOLS, FORMING THE NEW ST. PAUL TRAVELERS

REINSURANCE POOL EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005, RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2005.

TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY IS THE LEAD COMPANY OF THE NEW POOL, WHICH INCLUDES

28 COMPANIES. THE COMPANY ALSO MERGED GULF INSURANCE COMPANY, THE LEAD COMPANY

OF THE FORMER GULF INSURANCE GROUP, INTO TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY EFFECTIVE

JULY 1, 2005. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THERE WERE TWO INTERCOMPANY POOLING

ARRANGEMENTS: THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS REINSURANCE POOL AND THE NORTHLAND POOL.

RATINGS

RATINGS

ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SETTING THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE

INSURANCE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY RECEIVES RATINGS FROM THE FOLLOWING MAJOR

RATING AGENCIES: A.M. BEST COMPANY (A.M. BEST), FITCH RATINGS (FITCH), MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODYS) AND STANDARD & POORS CORP. (S&P). RATING

AGENCIES TYPICALLY ISSUE TWO TYPES OF RATINGS: CLAIMS-PAYING (OR FINANCIAL

STRENGTH) RATINGS WHICH ASSESS AN INSURERS ABILITY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL

OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND DEBT RATINGS WHICH ASSESS A COMPANYS

PROSPECTS FOR REPAYING ITS DEBTS AND ASSIST LENDERS IN SETTING INTEREST RATES

AND TERMS FOR A COMPANYS SHORT AND LONG TERM BORROWING NEEDS. AGENCY RATINGS

ARE NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY, SELL OR HOLD ANY SECURITY, AND THEY MAY BE

REVISED OR WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME BY THE RATING ORGANIZATION. EACH AGENCYS

RATING SHOULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER AGENCYS RATING. THE

SYSTEM AND THE NUMBER OF RATING CATEGORIES CAN VARY WIDELY FROM RATING AGENCY

TO RATING AGENCY. CUSTOMERS USUALLY FOCUS ON CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS, WHILE

CREDITORS FOCUS ON DEBT RATINGS. INVESTORS USE BOTH TO EVALUATE A COMPANYS

OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH. THE RATINGS ISSUED ON THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES

BY ANY OF THESE AGENCIES ARE ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY AND ARE AVAILABLE ON THE

COMPANYS WEBSITE AND FROM THE AGENCIES.

THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A DOWNGRADE IN

ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR,

THERE COULD BE A REDUCED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD BE

IMPACTED AND HIGHER BORROWING COSTS MAY BE INCURRED.

NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

COMPETITION

THE

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE AREAS OF

PRICE, SERVICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AGENT RELATIONSHIPS AND METHOD OF

DISTRIBUTION, I.E., USE OF INDEPENDENT AGENTS, EXCLUSIVE AGENTS AND/OR SALARIED

EMPLOYEES. ACCORDING TO A.M. BEST, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 975 PROPERTY

CASUALTY ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 2,400

PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES. OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS, THE TOP 150 ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 92% OF THE CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRYS TOTAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN

2004. SEVERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL LINES OF

BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK

PROTECTION IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE THAT UTILIZE

CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS, HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED IN

REACTION TO THE ESCALATING COST OF INSURANCE CAUSED IN PART BY INCREASED COSTS

FROM WORKERS COMPENSATION CASES AND JURY AWARDS IN THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY

CASES.

23

COMMERCIAL.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS REPRESENTED IN THE

COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE BY MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZE AS WELL AS

OTHER ENTITIES OFFERING RISK ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS OR

CAPTIVE PROGRAMS. MARKET COMPETITION WORKS WITHIN THE INSURANCE REGULATORY

FRAMEWORK TO SET THE PRICE CHARGED FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND THE LEVEL OF

SERVICE PROVIDED. GROWTH IS DRIVEN BY A COMPANYS ABILITY TO PROVIDE INSURANCE

AND SERVICES AT A PRICE THAT IS REASONABLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE CUSTOMER. IN

ADDITION, THE MARKETPLACE IS AFFECTED BY AVAILABLE CAPACITY OF THE INSURANCE

INDUSTRY, AS MEASURED BY POLICYHOLDERS SURPLUS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF

REINSURANCE. SURPLUS EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS PRIMARILY IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROFIT

LEVELS GENERATED BY THE INDUSTRY. GROWTH IN PREMIUM AND SERVICE BUSINESS IS

ALSO MEASURED BY A COMPANYS ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND TO

ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, MANY LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS

SELF-INSURE THEIR RISKS OR UTILIZE LARGE DEDUCTIBLES ON PURCHASED INSURANCE.

COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN

WRITTEN THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, ALTHOUGH SOME COMPANIES USE

DIRECT WRITING. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY

CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES WILLING TO WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING

TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND PRICING AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL INSURANCE

COMPANIES AND COMPANIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED NICHE PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. COMPANIES COMPETE ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, RESPONSE TIME

IN POLICY ISSUANCE AND CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY,

IMPROVED EFFICIENCY THROUGH AUTOMATION AND RESPONSE TIME TO CUSTOMER NEEDS ARE

KEY TO SUCCESS IN THIS MARKET. COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS ALSO UTILIZES DEDICATED

UNITS TO TAILOR INSURANCE PROGRAMS TO UNIQUE INSURANCE NEEDS. THESE UNITS ARE

NATIONAL PROPERTY, TRANSPORTATION, BOILER AND MACHINERY, INLAND MARINE,

AGRIBUSINESS, EXCESS AND SURPLUS AND NATIONAL PROGRAMS.

SELECT ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY WRITTEN

THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS. BOTH

NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE IN THE

SELECT ACCOUNTS MARKET WHICH GENERALLY COMPRISES LOWER HAZARD, MAIN STREET

BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. RISKS ARE UNDERWRITTEN AND PRICED USING STANDARD INDUSTRY

PRACTICES AND A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRODUCT

OFFERINGS. COMPETITION IN THIS MARKET IS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT

OFFERINGS AND RESPONSE TIME IN POLICY SERVICES. SELECT ACCOUNTS HAS ESTABLISHED

A STRONG MARKETING RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND HAS PROVIDED

IT WITH DEFINED UNDERWRITING POLICIES, A BROAD ARRAY OF PRODUCTS, COMPETITIVE

PRICES AND ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT AUTOMATED ENVIRONMENTS IN THE INDUSTRY. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED CENTRALIZED SERVICE CENTERS TO HELP

AGENTS PERFORM MANY SERVICE FUNCTIONS, IN RETURN FOR A FEE. SELECT ACCOUNTS

OVERALL SERVICE PLATFORM IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST IN THE SMALL BUSINESS

COMMERCIAL MARKET.

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY WRITTEN

THROUGH NATIONAL BROKERS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS. INSURANCE

COMPANIES COMPETE IN THIS MARKET BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, CLAIM AND

LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES, MANAGED CARE COST CONTAINMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

INFORMATION SYSTEMS. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS ALSO OFFERS A LARGE NATIONWIDE NETWORK

OF LOCALIZED CLAIM SERVICE CENTERS WHICH PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN CLAIMS

ADJUSTING AND ALLOWS NATIONAL ACCOUNTS TO MORE QUICKLY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF

ITS CUSTOMERS. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS RESIDUAL MARKET BUSINESS ALSO COMPETES FOR

STATE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES. THESE

CONTRACTS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE THREE-YEAR TERMS, ARE SELECTED BY STATE

AGENCIES THROUGH A BID PROCESS BASED ON THE QUALITY OF SERVICE AND PRICE. NATIONAL

ACCOUNTS SERVICES APPROXIMATELY 36% OF THE TOTAL WORKERS COMPENSATION ASSIGNED

RISK MARKET, MAKING THE COMPANY ONE OF THE LARGEST SERVICING INSURERS IN THE

INDUSTRY.

DISCOVER RE COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL PROVIDERS OF

COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COVERAGES, AS WELL AS OTHER UNDERWRITERS OF PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE IN THE ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER MARKET THAT OFFER COVERAGES

BOTH ON A BUNDLED AND UNBUNDLED BASIS, RISK RETENTION GROUPS, SELF-INSURANCE

PLANS, CAPTIVES MANAGED BY OTHERS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER RISK-FINANCING

VEHICLES AND MECHANISMS.

THE MARKET IN WHICH GULF COMPETED INCLUDED SMALL TO

MID-SIZE NICHE COMPANIES THAT TARGET SPECIFIC LINES OF INSURANCE AND LARGER,

MULTI-LINE COMPANIES THAT FOCUS ON VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF THE SPECIALTY ACCOUNTS

MARKET. PRIOR TO BEING PLACED IN RUNOFF IN 2004, GULFS BUSINESS WAS GENERALLY

WRITTEN THROUGH RETAIL AND WHOLESALE AGENTS AND BROKERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

STATES.

SPECIALTY.

THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE IN WHICH THE

SPECIALTY SEGMENT OPERATES IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS DESCRIBED

PREVIOUSLY FOR THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT. THE COMPANYS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE WITH OTHER STOCK COMPANIES, MUTUAL COMPANIES,

ALTERNATIVE RISK SHARING GROUPS AND OTHER UNDERWRITING ORGANIZATIONS.

COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY-CASUALTY INSURANCE

COMPANIES WILLING TO WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS

AND PRICING AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMPANIES

THAT HAVE DEVELOPED NICHE PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION,

MANY LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS SELF-INSURE THEIR RISKS OR UTILIZE LARGE

DEDUCTIBLES ON PURCHASED INSURANCE.

24

BOND UNDERWRITES AND MARKETS ITS PRODUCTS TO

NATIONAL, MID-SIZED AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS

INDIVIDUALS, AND DISTRIBUTES THEM THROUGH BOTH NATIONAL AND WHOLESALE BROKERS,

AND RETAIL AGENTS AND REGIONAL BROKERS. BOND COMPETES IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

SURETY AND EXECUTIVE LIABILITY MARKETPLACES. BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE WITH BOND. BONDS REPUTATION FOR

TIMELY AND CONSISTENT DECISION-MAKING, A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCAL

UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS AND INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND STRONG PRODUCER AND CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL AS ITS ABILITY TO OFFER ITS CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE OF

PRODUCTS, ENABLE IT TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY. BONDS ABILITY TO CROSS-SELL ITS

PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS OF THE COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL SEGMENTS PROVIDES FURTHER

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES FOR THE COMPANY.

CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS HAS

HISTORICALLY BEEN WRITTEN THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. COMPETITORS

IN THIS INDUSTRY INCLUDE BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE

COMPANIES. COMPANIES COMPETE ON PRICE, COVERAGE OFFERINGS, CLAIM AND LOSS

PREVENTION SERVICES, MANAGED CARE COST CONTAINMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CONSTRUCTION OFFERS A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCALIZED,

DEDICATED CLAIM SERVICE PROFESSIONALS THAT PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN

CLAIMS ADJUSTING AND ALLOWS CONSTRUCTION TO MORE QUICKLY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS

OF ITS CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, DEDICATED RISK CONTROL PROFESSIONALS WORK

DIRECTLY WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE EVALUATION, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SAFETY

PROGRAMS TO BETTER CONTROL RISK AND EXPOSURE TO LOSS.

FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES BUSINESS IS

TYPICALLY WRITTEN THROUGH NATIONAL BROKERS, REGIONAL BROKERS, AND INDEPENDENT

AGENTS. INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE ON PRICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS. THE COMPANY

HAS DEVELOPED A STRONG REPUTATION IN THIS COMPLEX, DYNAMIC MARKET SEGMENT AND

HAS AN ADVANTAGE OVER MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS IN OFFERING A WIDE BREADTH OF

PROFESSIONAL AND GENERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COVERAGES TO ITS FINANCIAL AND

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER DOMESTIC BUSINESS GROUPS IN

SPECIALTY THAT COMPETE IN FOCUSED TARGET MARKETS. EACH OF THESE MARKETS ARE

DIFFERENT AND REQUIRE UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE, PROPRIETARY

COVERAGE FORMS, SPECIALIZED RISK CONTROL AND LOSS HANDLING SERVICES, AND

PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENTS AND BROKERS THAT ALSO FOCUS ON THESE MARKETS. IN SOME

CASES THE COMPETITION IS NATIONAL CARRIERS WITH SIMILARLY DEDICATED

UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING GROUPS. IN OTHER CASES SMALLER REGIONAL COMPANIES

TEND TO BE THE PRIMARY COMPETITION. IN EITHER CASE THESE BUSINESSES HAVE

REGIONAL STRUCTURES THAT ALLOW THEM TO DELIVER PERSONALIZED SERVICE AND LOCAL

KNOWLEDGE TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. SPECIALIZED AGENTS AND BROKERS SUPPLEMENT

THIS STRATEGY. IN ALL OF THESE BUSINESSES, THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY IS MARKET

LEADERSHIP ATTAINED THROUGH FOCUSED INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE APPLIED TO INSURANCE AND

RISK NEEDS.

INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS

INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL COUNTRY INSURERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. COMPANIES COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS

AND THE LEVEL OF CLAIM AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROVIDED. SPECIALTY HAS

DEVELOPED EXPERTISE IN VARIOUS SPECIALTY MARKETS IN THESE COUNTRIES SIMILAR TO

THOSE SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDES BOTH PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

COVERAGE FOR THESE MARKETS. THIS SPECIALTY FOCUS IS A PARTICULAR COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE IN THESE COUNTRIES WHERE OUR COMPETITORS HAVE NOT DEVELOPED EXPERTISE

IN THESE SPECIALTY MARKETS.  PRODUCTS ARE

GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER OF LOCAL COUNTRY BROKERS

WHOSE CUSTOMER GROUPS ALIGN WITH THE COMPANYS SPECIALTY MARKETS.

AT LLOYDS, INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY COMPETES WITH

OTHER SYNDICATES OPERATING IN THE LLOYDS MARKET AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL AND

DOMESTIC INSURERS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS WHERE INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY WRITES

BUSINESS WORLDWIDE. SYNDICATES ARE INCREASINGLY CAPITALIZED BY CORPORATE

CAPITAL, MUCH OF WHICH IS PROVIDED BY LARGE INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE

ENTERPRISES. COMPETITION IS AGAIN BASED ON PRICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS.

INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY HAS AN EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON LINES IT BELIEVES IT CAN

UNDERWRITE EFFECTIVELY AND PROFITABLY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON SHORT-TAIL INSURANCE PRIMARY

LINES. SPECIALTY UNDERWRITES FOUR MAJOR CLASSES OF BUSINESS AT LLOYDS: AVIATION,

MARINE, GLOBAL PROPERTY, AND ACCIDENT AND SPECIAL RISKS.

PERSONAL.

PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE IS WRITTEN BY

HUNDREDS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZES. ALTHOUGH NATIONAL COMPANIES

WRITE THE MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESS, PERSONAL ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM LOCAL

OR REGIONAL COMPANIES WHICH OFTEN HAVE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE OF THEIR

KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCAL MARKETPLACE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL AGENTS.

PERSONAL BELIEVES THAT THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS ARE PRICE, SERVICE,

PERCEIVED STABILITY OF THE INSURER AND NAME RECOGNITION. PERSONAL COMPETES FOR

BUSINESS WITHIN EACH INDEPENDENT AGENCY SINCE THESE AGENCIES ALSO OFFER

POLICIES OF COMPETING COMPANIES. AT THE AGENCY LEVEL, COMPETITION IS PRIMARILY

BASED ON PRICE AND THE LEVEL OF SERVICE, INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING, AS WELL AS

THE LEVEL OF AUTOMATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH

INDIVIDUAL AGENTS. PERSONAL ALSO COMPETES WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT USE

EXCLUSIVE AGENTS OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO

ITS TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENT AGENCY DISTRIBUTION, PERSONAL HAS BROADENED ITS

DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS BY MARKETING TO SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING

EMPLOYEE AND AFFINITY GROUPS, AND THROUGH JOINT MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH

OTHER INSURERS. PERSONAL BELIEVES THAT ITS CONTINUED FOCUS ON EXPENSE

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, UNDERWRITING AND PRICING SEGMENTATION, AND CLAIM

SETTLEMENT EFFECTIVENESS STRATEGIES ENABLE PERSONAL TO PRICE ITS PRODUCTS

COMPETITIVELY IN ALL OF ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

25

REGULATION

STATE REGULATION

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATION IN THE VARIOUS STATES AND JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY TRANSACT

BUSINESS. THE EXTENT OF REGULATION VARIES, BUT GENERALLY DERIVES FROM STATUTES

THAT DELEGATE REGULATORY, SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO A

DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN EACH STATE. THE REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND

ADMINISTRATION RELATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST

BE MET AND MAINTAINED, THE LICENSING OF INSURERS AND THEIR AGENTS, THE NATURE

OF AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS, PREMIUM RATES, RESTRICTIONS ON THE SIZE OF

RISKS THAT MAY BE INSURED UNDER A SINGLE POLICY, RESERVES AND PROVISIONS FOR

UNEARNED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS, DEPOSITS OF SECURITIES FOR THE

BENEFIT OF POLICYHOLDERS, APPROVAL OF POLICY FORMS AND THE REGULATION OF MARKET

CONDUCT, INCLUDING THE USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION IN UNDERWRITING AS WELL AS

OTHER UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, MANY STATES HAVE ENACTED

VARIATIONS OF COMPETITIVE RATE-MAKING LAWS, WHICH ALLOW INSURERS TO SET CERTAIN

PREMIUM RATES FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF INSURANCE WITHOUT HAVING TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR

APPROVAL OF THE STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS ALSO

CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE AFFAIRS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND REQUIRE

THE FILING OF ANNUAL AND OTHER REPORTS RELATING TO THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF

COMPANIES AND OTHER MATTERS. AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE COLLECTIVELY LICENSED TO TRANSACT INSURANCE BUSINESS IN ALL

STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, GUAM, PUERTO RICO, BERMUDA, AND THE U.S.

VIRGIN ISLANDS, AS WELL AS AUSTRALIA, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, THE PHILIPPINES, THE

UNITED KINGDOM, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, SOUTH AFRICA AND CENTRAL AND SOUTH

AMERICA.

AS PART OF ONGOING, INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS,

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING 18 STATES AND

THE SEC. THE AREAS OF INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE ITS RELATIONSHIP

WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS, THE COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT WITH NON-TRADITIONAL

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS, BRANDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SALVAGE

AUTOMOBILES AND THE REPORTING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION PREMIUMS. THE COMPANY IS

COOPERATING WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. SEE PART I

 ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, THE COMPANY IS NOT REGULATED

AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. HOWEVER, AS THE COMPANY OWNS CAPITAL STOCK IN

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, IT IS SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY

STATUTES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER LAWS, OF EACH OF THE STATES OF DOMICILE OF

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. ALL HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS

OTHER LAWS, REQUIRE DISCLOSURE AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, PRIOR APPROVAL OF

MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND AN AFFILIATE. THE

HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES AS WELL AS OTHER LAWS ALSO REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PRIOR APPROVAL OF AN ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF A DOMESTIC INSURER, SOME

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AFFILIATES AND THE PAYMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS.

INSURANCE REGULATION CONCERNING

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

DOMICILED IN THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT AND MINNESOTA. THE INSURANCE HOLDING

COMPANY LAWS OF BOTH STATES APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRE

NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE

DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND, THAT TOGETHER WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE

INSURERS CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE

INSURERS NET INCOME FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31,

IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND

BY STATE REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED

UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES.

THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES

IN WHICH THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN

SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE RESTRICTIVE, LIMITATIONS ON

THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

ASSESSMENTS FOR GUARANTY FUNDS AND

SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

VIRTUALLY ALL STATES REQUIRE INSURERS LICENSED TO DO

BUSINESS IN THEIR STATE TO BEAR A PORTION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED BY SOME INSUREDS

AS A RESULT OF THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURERS. DEPENDING UPON STATE LAW,

INSURERS CAN BE ASSESSED AN AMOUNT THAT IS GENERALLY EQUAL TO BETWEEN 1% AND 2%

OF PREMIUMS WRITTEN FOR THE RELEVANT LINES OF INSURANCE IN THAT STATE EACH YEAR

TO PAY THE CLAIMS OF AN INSOLVENT INSURER. PART OF THESE PAYMENTS IS

RECOVERABLE THROUGH FUTURE PREMIUM RATES, PREMIUM TAX CREDITS OR POLICY

SURCHARGES. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ASSESSMENTS COULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO RECOVER SUCH ASSESSMENTS THROUGH TAX

CREDITS OR OTHER MEANS. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS

TO LIMIT OR REPEAL THE TAX OFFSET PROVISIONS, WHICH EFFORTS, TO DATE, HAVE BEEN

GENERALLY UNSUCCESSFUL.  THESE

ASSESSMENTS LEVELED OFF IN 2005 AND IN CERTAIN STATES BEGAN TO DECREASE.  THESE ASSESSMENTS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE

IF ADDITIONAL INSOLVENCIES OCCUR.

26

MANY STATES HAVE LAWS THAT ESTABLISHED SECOND-INJURY

FUNDS TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO INJURED EMPLOYEES FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRIOR

CONDITION OR INJURY. INSURERS WRITING WORKERS COMPENSATION IN THOSE STATES

HAVING SECOND-INJURY FUNDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS CREATING THE FUNDS, INCLUDING

THE VARIOUS FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT THOSE STATES HAVE ADOPTED TO FUND THE

SECOND-INJURY FUNDS. SEVERAL OF THE STATES HAVING LARGER SECOND-INJURY FUNDS

UTILIZE A PREMIUM SURCHARGE THAT EFFECTIVELY PASSES THE COST OF THE FUND TO

POLICYHOLDERS. OTHER STATES ASSESS THE INSURER BASED ON PAID LOSSES AND ALLOW

THE INSURER TO RECOUP THE ASSESSMENT THROUGH FUTURE PREMIUM RATES.

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO

REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNED RISK POOLS, PRINCIPALLY

INVOLVING WORKERS COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, WHICH PROVIDE VARIOUS

INSURANCE COVERAGES TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE

TO PURCHASE THAT COVERAGE IN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. PARTICIPATION IN THESE POOLS

IN MOST STATES IS GENERALLY IN PROPORTION TO VOLUNTARY WRITINGS OF RELATED

LINES OF BUSINESS IN THAT STATE. IN THE EVENT THAT A MEMBER OF THAT POOL

BECOMES INSOLVENT, THE REMAINING MEMBERS ASSUME AN ADDITIONAL PRO RATA SHARE OF

THE LIABILITIES OF THE POOL. THE UNDERWRITING RESULTS OF THESE POOLS

TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN UNPROFITABLE. COMBINED EARNED PREMIUMS RELATED TO SUCH

POOLS AND ASSIGNED RISKS FOR THE COMPANY WERE $174 MILLION, $168 MILLION AND $160

MILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE RELATED COMBINED UNDERWRITING

LOSSES FOR THE COMPANY WERE $112 MILLION, $71 MILLION AND $111 MILLION IN 2005,

2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY CHANGES HAVE

BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE STATES FROM TIME TO TIME THAT WOULD MODIFY SOME OF THE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE

USE OF INFORMATION. THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THAT LEGISLATION ON THE COMPANYS

BUSINESSES CANNOT BE PREDICTED AT THIS TIME.

INSURANCE REGULATIONS CONCERNING

CHANGE OF CONTROL

MANY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY LAWS INTENDED

PRIMARILY FOR THE PROTECTION OF POLICYHOLDERS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE

ADVANCE APPROVAL BY STATE AGENCIES OF ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF AN INSURANCE

COMPANY THAT IS DOMICILED, OR, IN SOME CASES, HAVING SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS THAT

IT IS DEEMED TO BE COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED, IN THAT STATE. THE COMPANY OWNS,

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ALL OF THE SHARES OF STOCK OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE COMPANIES DOMICILED IN THE STATES OF ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA,

CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE, FLORIDA, ILLINOIS, INDIANA, IOWA, MARYLAND,

MASSACHUSETTS, MINNESOTA, MISSISSIPPI, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, TEXAS AND

WISCONSIN. CONTROL IS GENERALLY PRESUMED TO EXIST THROUGH THE OWNERSHIP OF

10% (5% IN THE CASE OF FLORIDA) OR MORE OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF A DOMESTIC

INSURANCE COMPANY OR OF ANY COMPANY THAT CONTROLS A DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY.

ANY PURCHASER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTING 10% (5% IN THE CASE OF

FLORIDA) OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER OF THE COMPANYS CAPITAL STOCK WILL BE

PRESUMED TO HAVE ACQUIRED CONTROL OF THE COMPANYS DOMESTIC INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS, FOLLOWING APPLICATION BY THAT PURCHASER IN EACH INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARYS STATE OF DOMICILE, THE RELEVANT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DETERMINES

OTHERWISE.

IN ADDITION TO THESE FILINGS, THE LAWS OF MANY

STATES CONTAIN PROVISIONS REQUIRING PRE-NOTIFICATION TO STATE AGENCIES PRIOR TO

ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF A NON-DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY ADMITTED TO TRANSACT

BUSINESS IN THAT STATE. WHILE THESE PRE-NOTIFICATION STATUTES DO NOT AUTHORIZE

THE STATE AGENCY TO DISAPPROVE THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, THEY DO AUTHORIZE

ISSUANCE OF CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS WITH RESPECT TO THE NON-DOMESTIC INSURER IF

IT IS DETERMINED THAT SOME CONDITIONS, SUCH AS UNDUE MARKET CONCENTRATION,

WOULD RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION.

ANY TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN

CONTROL OF ANY OF THE COMPANYS INSURER SUBSIDIARIES WOULD GENERALLY REQUIRE

PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANYS

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED OR COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED AND MAY REQUIRE

PREACQUISITION NOTIFICATION IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED PREACQUISITION

NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS AND IN WHICH SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ADMITTED

TO TRANSACT BUSINESS.

ONE OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS ARE DOMICILED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. INSURERS

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES AND MARKETS ACT OF 2000 INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES AUTHORITY. INSURERS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY THE IRISH FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATORY AUTHORITY.

SOME OF THE COMPANYS OTHER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

ARE DOMICILED IN, OR AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT INSURANCE BUSINESS IN, CANADA. AUTHORIZED

INSURERS IN CANADA ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 407

OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT, INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE OFFICE OF THE

SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY DETER, DELAY OR PREVENT

TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING THE CONTROL OF OR THE OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK,

INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE COMPANYS

SHAREHOLDERS.

27

INSURANCE REGULATORY INFORMATION

SYSTEM

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS

(NAIC) INSURANCE REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM (IRIS) WAS DEVELOPED TO HELP

STATE REGULATORS IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION. THE

IRIS SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A STATISTICAL PHASE AND AN ANALYTICAL PHASE WHEREBY

FINANCIAL EXAMINERS REVIEW ANNUAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL RATIOS. THE

STATISTICAL PHASE CONSISTS OF TWELVE KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS BASED ON YEAR-END

DATA THAT ARE GENERATED FROM THE NAIC DATABASE ANNUALLY, AND EACH RATIO HAS AN

ESTABLISHED USUAL RANGE OF RESULTS. THESE RATIOS ASSIST STATE INSURANCE

DEPARTMENTS IN EXECUTING THEIR STATUTORY MANDATE TO OVERSEE THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES.

A RATIO RESULT FALLING OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE OF

IRIS RATIOS IS NOT CONSIDERED A FAILING RESULT; RATHER, UNUSUAL VALUES ARE

VIEWED AS PART OF THE REGULATORY EARLY MONITORING SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, IN SOME

YEARS, IT MAY NOT BE UNUSUAL FOR FINANCIALLY SOUND COMPANIES TO HAVE SEVERAL

RATIOS WITH RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES. GENERALLY, AN INSURANCE COMPANY

WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY IF IT FALLS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES

OF FOUR OR MORE OF THE RATIOS.

BASED ON PRELIMINARY 2005 IRIS RATIOS CALCULATED BY

THE COMPANY, MOST OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN THE ST. PAUL

TRAVELERS REINSURANCE POOL HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE FOR THE TWO-YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RATIO, WITH RATIOS RANGING FROM 20% TO 39% (VERSUS THE

USUAL VALUE OF LESS THAN 20%), DUE TO RESERVE STRENGTHENING ACTIONS THAT

OCCURRED IN 2004 AND THE COMBINING OF THE TWO POOLS THAT OCCURRED IN 2005. IN

ADDITION, DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR

THE ONE-YEAR AND TWO-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RATIOS, WITH RATIOS OF 32% AND

116%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE USUAL VALUE OF LESS THAN 20%, DUE TO

RESERVE STRENGTHENING ACTIONS IN 2005 AND 2004. DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY

ALSO HAD A RESULT OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THE TWO-YEAR OPERATING RATIO

(128% VERSUS THE USUAL VALUE OF LESS THAN 100%) DUE TO THE SAME RESERVE

STRENGTHENING ACTIONS.

IN 2004, MOST OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES IN THE TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY POOL HAD IRIS RATIO RESULTS

OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE FOR THE ESTIMATED CURRENT RESERVE DEFICIENCY TO SURPLUS

RATIO, WITH RATIOS RANGING FROM 26% TO 37% ABOVE THE USUAL VALUE OF LESS THAN

25%, DUE TO THE LAGS IN THE RATIOS ABILITY TO REFLECT CHANGES IN BUSINESS

VOLUME AND BUSINESS MIX. ALSO IN 2004, ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE

COMPANY, UNITED STATES FIDELITY AND GUARANTY COMPANY, DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY

AND MOST OF THE ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE POOL MEMBERS HAD UNUSUAL VALUES IN THE

ONE-YEAR AND TWO-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RATIOS ABOVE THE USUAL VALUES OF LESS

THAN 20%, DUE TO RESERVE STRENGTHENING ACTIONS THAT OCCURRED IN 2003 AND 2004.

THOSE ONE-YEAR AND TWO-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RATIOS FOR ST. PAUL FIRE AND

MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY WERE 24% AND 40%, FOR UNITED STATES FIDELITY AND

GUARANTY COMPANY THE RATIOS WERE 78% AND 29%, AND FOR DISCOVER REINSURANCE

COMPANY THE RATIOS WERE 64% AND 151%. THE ONE-YEAR AND TWO-YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT RATIOS FOR THE ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE POOL MEMBERS WITH UNUSUAL

VALUES RANGED FROM 22% TO 45% AND 40% TO 93% RESPECTIVELY. UNITED STATES

FIDELITY AND GUARANTY COMPANY AND DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY HAD TWO-YEAR

OPERATING RATIOS OF 159% AND 108%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE USUAL VALUE OF

LESS THAN 100%, DUE TO THE 2004 RESERVE STRENGTHENING ACTIONS. UNITED STATES

FIDELITY AND GUARANTY COMPANY AND DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY ALSO HAD CHANGE

IN SURPLUS RATIOS OF 63% AND 78%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO A USUAL VALUE OF

LESS THAN 50%, DUE TO 2004 CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THEIR PARENT COMPANIES.

DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY ALSO HAD A SURPLUS AID TO SURPLUS RATIO OF 17%

COMPARED TO THE USUAL VALUE OF LESS THAN 15%.

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE REGULATORY ACTION AS

A RESULT OF THE 2005 IRIS RATIO RESULTS. IN ALL OF THESE INSTANCES IN PRIOR

YEARS, REGULATORS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED UPON FOLLOW-UP THAT NO REGULATORY ACTION

WAS REQUIRED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SIMILAR RESULTS COULD OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. NO

REGULATORY ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN BY ANY STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT OR THE NAIC

WITH RESPECT TO IRIS RATIOS OF ANY OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004.

28

RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC)

REQUIREMENTS

IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE REGULATION OF INSURER

SOLVENCY, THE NAIC HAS ADOPTED A FORMULA AND MODEL LAW TO IMPLEMENT RBC

REQUIREMENTS FOR MOST PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHICH IS

DESIGNED TO DETERMINE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF

PROTECTION THAT STATUTORY SURPLUS PROVIDES FOR POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS. THE

RBC FORMULA FOR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES MEASURES THREE MAJOR

AREAS OF RISK FACING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS.



UNDERWRITING, WHICH ENCOMPASSES THE RISK OF

ADVERSE LOSS DEVELOPMENTS AND INADEQUATE PRICING;



DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES ARISING FROM MARKET

AND/OR CREDIT RISK; AND



OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK ARISING FROM ADVERSE

EXPERIENCE FROM NON-CONTROLLED ASSETS, GUARANTEES FOR AFFILIATES OR OTHER

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND RESERVE AND PREMIUM GROWTH.

UNDER LAWS ADOPTED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES, INSURERS

HAVING TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED BY THE RBC CALCULATION

WILL BE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL

OF CAPITAL INADEQUACY.

THE RBC LAW PROVIDES FOR FOUR LEVELS OF REGULATORY

ACTION. THE EXTENT OF REGULATORY INTERVENTION AND ACTION INCREASES AS THE LEVEL

OF SURPLUS TO RBC FALLS. THE FIRST LEVEL, THE COMPANY ACTION LEVEL AS DEFINED

BY THE NAIC, REQUIRES AN INSURER TO SUBMIT A PLAN OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO THE

REGULATOR IF SURPLUS FALLS BELOW 200% OF THE RBC AMOUNT. THE REGULATORY ACTION

LEVEL, AS DEFINED BY THE NAIC, REQUIRES AN INSURER TO SUBMIT A PLAN CONTAINING

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND REQUIRES THE RELEVANT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO PERFORM

AN EXAMINATION OR OTHER ANALYSIS AND ISSUE A CORRECTIVE ORDER IF SURPLUS FALLS

BELOW 150% OF THE RBC AMOUNT. THE AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL, AS DEFINED BY THE

NAIC, AUTHORIZES THE RELEVANT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO TAKE WHATEVER

REGULATORY ACTIONS CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

POLICYHOLDERS AND CREDITORS OF THE INSURER WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE ACTIONS

NECESSARY TO CAUSE THE INSURER TO BE PLACED UNDER REGULATORY CONTROL, I.E.,

REHABILITATION OR LIQUIDATION, IF SURPLUS FALLS BELOW 100% OF THE RBC AMOUNT.

THE FOURTH ACTION LEVEL IS THE MANDATORY CONTROL LEVEL AS DEFINED BY THE NAIC,

WHICH REQUIRES THE RELEVANT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO PLACE THE INSURER UNDER

REGULATORY CONTROL IF SURPLUS FALLS BELOW 70% OF THE RBC AMOUNT.

THE FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE

AMONG ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF

CAPITAL. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE TO USE THE FORMULAS TO

RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, ALL OF THE COMPANYS

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN

EXCESS OF AMOUNTS REQUIRING COMPANY OR REGULATORY ACTION AT ANY PRESCRIBED RBC

ACTION LEVEL.

OTHER INFORMATION

GENERAL BUSINESS FACTORS

IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, NO

MATERIAL PART OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS DEPENDENT

UPON A SINGLE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF CUSTOMERS, THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OF WHICH

WOULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY, AND NO ONE CUSTOMER OR

GROUP OF AFFILIATED CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTS FOR AS MUCH AS 10% OF THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES.

EMPLOYEES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY

31,900 EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE

SATISFACTORY. NONE OF THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE

BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY

CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS

REPORT, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES

THERETO.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY

REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE

CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE.

OUR

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF

CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, INCLUDING

HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER AND FIRES.

CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO BE MAN-MADE, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE

INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS) OR A CONSEQUENCE

OF WAR OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR BUSINESS

SUBJECTS US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE FROM HURRICANES IN THE NORTHEAST, FLORIDA,

GULF COAST AND MID-ATLANTIC REGIONS, AS WELL AS CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE FROM

EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE NEW MADRID AND PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGIONS AND

OTHER WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.  THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES

ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, CHANGING CLIMACTIC

CONDITIONS HAVE ADDED TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND FREQUENCY OF NATURAL

DISASTERS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD AND CREATED ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS

TO FUTURE TRENDS AND EXPOSURES.  IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL AND MAN-MADE

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS WILL INCREASE.  IN

PARTICULAR, WE EXPECT THAT THE TREND OF INCREASED

SEVERITY

AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS EXPERIENCED

IN 2005 AND 2004 WILL CONTINUE INTO 2006.

THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL

AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY

OF THE EVENT. STATES HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME PASSED LEGISLATION THAT HAS THE

EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK, SUCH AS

LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS FROM WITHDRAWING FROM CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS.

IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE

INITIATIVES AND COURT DECISIONS WHICH SEEK TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR

CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE POLICIES.  ALSO, OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICING TO THE

EXTENT NECESSARY TO OFFSET RISING COSTS OF CATASTROPHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE

PERSONAL SEGMENT, REQUIRES APPROVAL OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN

STATES.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS FOR ANY FISCAL QUARTER OR YEAR AND MAY MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY OR HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS AND COULD IMPAIR OUR

ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.  ALSO, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE FREQUENCY

AND SEVERITY OF STORMS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, RATING AGENCIES MAY INCREASE

THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN

OUR RATINGS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RATINGS. IN ADDITION,

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS

COULD

CAUSE US TO EXHAUST OUR AVAILABLE REINSURANCE LIMITS

AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF

REINSURANCE

.  WE

HAVE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM, AND ALTHOUGH THE

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005 PROVIDES BENEFITS IN THE EVENT

OF CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM, IT MAY NOT BE EXTENDED BEYOND 2007 OR ITS

BENEFITS MAY BE REDUCED.

37

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BECAUSE OF

OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS

AND RELATED LITIGATION.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS

. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS

THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND

THE INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS.

AS A RESULT, WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS

CLAIMS BEING TENDERED TO US BY OUR POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING

COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY) INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST OUR POLICYHOLDERS BY

INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT APPEAR TO BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE.  FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS

INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS, THE FOCUS

BY PLAINTIFFS ON NEW AND PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS AND ENTITIES SEEKING

BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS A RESULT OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES.  IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL

NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE

ASBESTOS-RELATED

LOSSES BY INITIALLY DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY

ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING US.  BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS ARE ALSO CAUSING

INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN

BANKRUPTCY BUT THAT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM.

IN ADDITION, OUR ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE EXPERIENCE IS

IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER

INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE

INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS.

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS WHO HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, ACANDS, INC.,

WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR

ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE AS

DESCRIBED GENERALLY IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH. ALSO SEE PART I  ITEM 3  LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS. THESE TRENDS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN THE NEAR TERM.  AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE,

THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE FROM

ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

IN SOME

INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS CONTINUE TO ASSERT THAT THEIR CLAIMS FOR

ASBESTOS-RELATED INSURANCE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE AND

THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED AS A SEPARATE

OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY.  IT IS

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH

ISSUES OR WHETHER WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ASSERTING ADDITIONAL DEFENSES.  TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN

POLICYHOLDERS FAVOR AND OTHER ADDITIONAL COMPANY DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL,

OUR COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY

INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE

NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS.  ACCORDINGLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE

ULTIMATE COST OF THE CLAIMS FOR COVERAGE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS.

MANY COVERAGE

DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS.  BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS

MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF SETTLEMENT

NEGOTIATIONS.  SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING

BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO US

BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN ORIGINALLY

ANTICIPATED. ALSO, COURTS MAY NOT APPROVE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS

,

WHICH WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES

FOR US.  AS IN THE PAST, WE WILL CONTINUE

TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN ADDITION,

PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US,

CHALLENGING INSURERS CONDUCT IN RESPECT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS BY

INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY

INJURIES.

THERE

MAY BE ADDITIONAL FILINGS

OF OTHER

DIRECT ACTIONS

AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN THE FUTURE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN

THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

. WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM

POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF

THEIR ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO

VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE,

COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED,

ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION

WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS

FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES

AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION.

LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

WE HAVE BEEN,

AND CONTINUE TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES

PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. WE BELIEVE THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS HAVE

INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF

THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE

POLICIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY US PRIOR TO THE MID-1970S. THESE DECISIONS

CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING

SOUGHT BY THE CLAIMANT FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND WE DO NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE

MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY

AMOUNT.

38

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

. IT IS

DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS

AND

RELATED LITIGATION.

A RESULT,

THESE

RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP.

THE CONTINUING

UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY

INHERENT IN

COMPLEX

LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM

THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER

ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS

, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHICH CANNOT NOW BE ANTICIPATED, THE

ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES

WE HAVE

ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES

PERTAINING TO THE

AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT

WITH

OUR PREVIOUS

ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS

, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST

US

AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO

OUR ABILITY TO

RECOVER REINSURANCE

FOR

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN ADDITION,

OUR ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE

EXPERIENCE

HAS BEEN

IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION

OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY

AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER

DEFENDANTS.

IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL

AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

THIS

DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS

WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION, INCLUDING PROPOSED LEGISLATION RELATED

TO ASBESTOS REFORM.

IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME OF LARGE COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR

COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT,

UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED.

THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE

CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE

NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE

EFFECTIVE.

SEE THE 

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

AND LITIGATION SECTIONS OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ALSO SEE PART I  ITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE,

ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT

RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

.  IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE.  THESE

ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT

NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

REINSURANCE MAY NOT PROTECT US AGAINST LOSSES.

WE

USE REINSURANCE TO HELP MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO PROPERTY AND CASUALTY RISKS. THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET

CONDITIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRICE AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY, WHICH CAN AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO US TO

THE EXTENT OF THE CEDED REINSURANCE, WE REMAIN LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON

ALL RISKS REINSURED. AS A RESULT, CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT

ELIMINATE OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT

RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS. IN

ADDITION, SOME OF OUR REINSURANCE CLAIMS MAY BE DISPUTED BY THE REINSURERS, AND

WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE PARTIAL OR NO PAYMENT. THIS IS A PARTICULAR RISK IN

THE CASE OF CLAIMS THAT RELATE TO INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO,

INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. REINSURANCE MAY

NOT PROTECT US AGAINST LOSSES AND MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO, AND MAY FACE ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING, MASS TORT CLAIMS SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES.

IN

ADDITION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO OTHER

TYPES OF MASS TORT CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY

HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING LEAD PAINT, SILICA AND WELDING ROD

FUMES.  ESTABLISHING CLAIM AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MASS TORT CLAIMS IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTIES

BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, DISPUTES

CONCERNING MEDICAL CAUSATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DISEASES,

GEOGRAPHICAL

CONCENTRATION OF THE LAWSUITS ASSERTING THE CLAIMS AND THE LARGE RISE IN THE

TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS WITHOUT UNDERLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS

SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN DISEASE RATES. MOREOVER, EVOLVING JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS TORT THEORIES AND

DEFENSES, INCLUDING APPLICATION OF VARIOUS THEORIES OF JOINT AND SEVERAL

LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THESE CLAIMS,

IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

BECAUSE OF

THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS

IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES.  IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE.  THESE ADDITIONAL

LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE

MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

39

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED

OUR LOSS RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF LOSS RESERVES ARE

NECESSARY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED

BUT NOT YET REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF

LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING

ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE.

THESE LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT

AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE,

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF

HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND

FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER

FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED

RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.

THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH

DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN

BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS

HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES,

AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS

AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE.

LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE

DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL

SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM

AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT

AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED

THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. WE CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A

REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL

CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. WE RIGOROUSLY ATTEMPT TO CONSIDER ALL

SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME LOSS RESERVES ARE

ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT ENVIRONMENT, FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT ANTICIPATED

AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN CURRENTLY RESERVEDFAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE.

THERE ARE ALSO RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE

ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE

AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY BY US AND OUR INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE

IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL

AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO

ESTABLISH THE RESERVES.  COMPLEX FACTORS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY

FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES;

ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE

IMPACT

OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE

EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY.  THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHES OCCURRENCE,

SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING

PERIOD.  THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO

CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH

ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT

RELATED RESERVES.  IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE.  THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES

IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND

COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR

OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

A PORTION OF OUR LOSS RESERVES ARE FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION WHICH AGGREGATED $4.79 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005. WHILE THE ONGOING STUDY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS

TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT

IN

COMPLEX

LITIGATION AND OTHER

UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN

LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT

THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN

FUTURE PERIODS. SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONSENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

FOR A

DISCUSSION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES BY PRODUCT LINE,

INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF COMMON FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT REQUIRED RESERVES, SEE MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES.

40

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING

CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

AS INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL,

JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND

UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIM AND COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY EITHER EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OUR

UNDERWRITING INTENT OR BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF CLAIMS. EXAMPLES OF

EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE.



INCREASES IN THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF CLAIMS

RELATED TO EXPENSES FOR TESTING AND REMEDIATION OF MOLD CONDITIONS;



INCREASES IN THE

NUMBER AND SIZE OF CLAIMS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS, WHICH OFTEN PRESENT

COMPLEX COVERAGE AND DAMAGE VALUATION QUESTIONS;



ADVERSE CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS,

INCLUDING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN MEDICAL COSTS AND AUTO AND HOME REPAIR

COSTS;



JUDICIAL

EXPANSION OF POLICY COVERAGE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY; AND



A GROWING TREND

OF PLAINTIFFS TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATING TO CLAIM-HANDLING AND OTHER

PRACTICES.

THE EFFECTS

OF THESE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY

HARD TO PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS THE SUBJECT OF A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS BY

STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS OR THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

AS PART OF ONGOING, INDUSTRY-WIDE

INVESTIGATIONS, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING

FROM THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF NUMEROUS STATES, VARIOUS STATES INSURANCE AND

BUSINESS REGULATORS AND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE AREAS OF INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO US INCLUDE

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS, OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH NON-TRADITIONAL

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS, BRANDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SALVAGE

AUTOMOBILES AND THE REPORTING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION PREMIUMS.  WE AND OUR AFFILIATES MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL

SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE OR OTHER AREAS

FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR AUTHORITIES.

WE ARE COOPERATING WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION,

SEE PART I  ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

IT WOULD BE

PREMATURE TO REACH ANY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS OR

THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

POTENTIAL

OUTCOMES COULD INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS OR SETTLEMENTS RESULTING IN

FINES, PENALTIES AND/OR CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION

, THESE INVESTIGATIONS MAY RESULT IN

CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL WHICH COULD,

IN TURN, ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED AND CHANGES IN REGULATION MAY REDUCE

OUR PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

WE ARE EXTENSIVELY REGULATED AND SUPERVISED IN THE

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING

LICENSING AND SUPERVISION BY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY AGENCIES IN SUCH

JURISDICTIONS.  THIS REGULATION IS

GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS, AND NOT

NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF INSURERS, THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER

INVESTORS.  THIS REGULATION ALSO RELATES

TO AUTHORIZATION FOR LINES OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS,

INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS, UNDERWRITING LIMITATIONS, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES,

DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS, CHANGES IN CONTROL, PREMIUM RATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER

FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF AN INSURERS BUSINESS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE STATE INSURANCE

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS COME UNDER INCREASED FEDERAL SCRUTINY, AND SOME STATE

LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR INCREASE STATE

AUTHORITY TO REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES.

FURTHER, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) AND STATE

INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY REEXAMINE EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY

FOCUSING ON MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OF

EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION,

CONGRESS AND SOME FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM TIME TO TIME INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT

CONDITION OF INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO

IMPOSE FEDERAL REGULATION OR TO ALLOW AN OPTIONAL FEDERAL INCORPORATION,

SIMILAR TO BANKS. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE EFFECT ANY PROPOSED OR

FUTURE LEGISLATION OR NAIC INITIATIVES MAY HAVE ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS.

INSURANCE LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE

RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT REQUIREMENTS OR MAY RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS.

41

ALTHOUGH THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DIRECTLY REGULATE THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, CHANGES IN

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES IN SEVERAL AREAS, INCLUDING

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION AND FEDERAL TAXATION, CAN

SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING US.

ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER SURCHARGES FOR GUARANTY FUNDS, SECOND-INJURY FUNDS,

CATASTROPHE FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY POOLING ARRANGEMENTS MAY REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY.

VIRTUALLY ALL STATES REQUIRE INSURERS LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS IN THEIR STATE TO

BEAR A PORTION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED BY SOME INSUREDS AS THE RESULT OF IMPAIRED

OR INSOLVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES. THESE ASSESSMENTS HAVE LEVELED OFF IN THE

RECENT YEAR AND IN CERTAIN STATES, HAVE BEGUN TO DECREASE.  THESE ASSESSMENTS MAY, HOWEVER, INCREASE IN

THE FUTURE IF ADDITIONAL INSOLVENCIES OCCUR.

MANY STATES ALSO HAVE LAWS THAT ESTABLISHED SECOND-INJURY FUNDS TO

PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO INJURED EMPLOYEES FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRIOR CONDITION

OR INJURY WHICH ARE FUNDED BY EITHER ASSESSMENTS BASED ON PAID LOSSES OR

PREMIUM SURCHARGE MECHANISMS. IN ADDITION, AS A CONDITION TO THE ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS STATES, OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES MUST PARTICIPATE

IN MANDATORY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY SHARED MARKET MECHANISMS OR POOLING ARRANGEMENTS,

WHICH PROVIDE VARIOUS TYPES OF INSURANCE COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER

ENTITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE THAT COVERAGE FROM PRIVATE

INSURERS. THE EFFECT OF THESE ASSESSMENTS AND MANDATORY SHARED-MARKET

MECHANISMS OR CHANGES IN THEM COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD OR LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.

A DOWNGRADE IN OUR CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS.

CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH

RATINGS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO AN INSURERS COMPETITIVE

POSITION.  RATING AGENCIES REVIEW THEIR

RATINGS PERIODICALLY, AND OUR CURRENT RATINGS MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED IN THE

FUTURE.  A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF

OUR RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, BECAUSE DEMAND FOR

CERTAIN

OF OUR

PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS MAY BE

REDUCED OR OUR RATINGS COULD FALL BELOW MINIMUM LEVELS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN

EXISTING BUSINESS.  ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY

FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HIGHER BORROWING COSTS

MAY BE INCURRED.  IF OUR CAPITAL POSITION

WERE TO DETERIORATE OR ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES WERE TO SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE

FUTURE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR LIMIT THE EXTENT OF A DOWNGRADE. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY OF WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHES IN THE LAST

TWO YEARS MAY LEAD RATING AGENCIES TO

SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASE THEIR

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

. THE RATINGS ARE NOT IN ANY WAY A

MEASURE OF PROTECTION OFFERED TO INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES AND SHOULD NOT BE

RELIED UPON WITH RESPECT TO MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES.  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR RATINGS,

SEE, ITEM 1 BUSINESS  RATINGS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR LOSSES WHICH COULD

REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OVERALL

PROFITABILITY.

ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FIXED

INCOME OR EQUITY MARKETS COULD IMPAIR OUR PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

CASH FLOWS.

FLUCTUATIONS

IN INTEREST RATES AFFECT OUR RETURNS ON, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF, FIXED INCOME

AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WHICH COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 93% OF THE MARKET

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.  IN ADDITION, DEFAULTS BY THIRD PARTIES,

PRIMARILY FROM INVESTMENTS IN LIQUID CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHO FAIL TO

PAY OR PERFORM ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OR RESULT IN INVESTMENT LOSSES.

WE INVEST A

PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IN EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER

VOLATILITY THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, STOCK

MARKET CONDITIONS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE

TIMING OF THE REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME. AS A RESULT OF THESE

FACTORS, WE MAY NOT REALIZE AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS, MAY INCUR

LOSSES ON SALES OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE

OF OUR INVESTMENTS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

THE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN

OR INCREASE OUR PROFITABILITY AND PREMIUM VOLUME.

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL REMAIN HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND

FOREIGN INSURERS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN WE DO. IN

ADDITION, SEVERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL LINES OF

BUSINESS NOW OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION, INCLUDING

LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE THAT UTILIZE

CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS. CONTINUED GROWTH IN

ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION COULD REDUCE OUR PREMIUM VOLUME. FOLLOWING

THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 AND AGAIN FOLLOWING THE HURRICANE

ACTIVITY IN 2004 AND 2005, A NUMBER OF NEW INSURERS AND REINSURERS WERE FORMED

TO COMPETE IN THE INDUSTRY, AND A NUMBER OF EXISTING MARKET PARTICIPANTS HAVE

RAISED NEW CAPITAL WHICH MAY ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO COMPETE.  FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NOW ABLE TO OFFER

SERVICES SIMILAR TO US AS A RESULT OF THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT, WHICH

REPEALED U.S. LAWS THAT SEPARATED COMMERCIAL BANKING, INVESTMENT BANKING

AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES.

42

OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING.



OUR

PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH,



RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING

AGENCIES,



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS,



AGENT, BROKER AND

CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS,



PREMIUMS

CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED

(INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED PROGRAMS),



SPEED OF CLAIMS PAYMENT,



REPUTATION, EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS

OF EMPLOYEES,



LOCAL PRESENCE AND



OUR ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO

COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

WE MAY HAVE

DIFFICULTY IN CONTINUING TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON ANY OF THESE BASES IN THE

FUTURE. IF COMPETITION LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS AT ADEQUATE

RATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  SEE ITEM 1  BUSINESS  COMPETITION.

THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN

SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY

FUTURE DIVIDENDS.

WE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY AND RELY IN PART ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON

OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND CORPORATE

EXPENSES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN

THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THEIR STATUTORY SURPLUS, EARNINGS AND REGULATORY

RESTRICTIONS.

WE AND OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY SOME STATES AS AN INSURANCE

HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. THIS REGULATION GENERALLY PROVIDES THAT TRANSACTIONS

BETWEEN COMPANIES WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM MUST BE FAIR AND EQUITABLE.

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS AMONG AFFILIATED COMPANIES, CERTAIN DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FROM

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN COMPANIES

WITHIN THE SYSTEM MAY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE TO, OR PRIOR APPROVAL BY, STATE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO

BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES.  THE ABILITY OF OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US ALSO IS RESTRICTED BY REGULATIONS

THAT SET STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED, THE NATURE OF

AND LIMITATION ON INVESTMENTS, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS TO

POLICYHOLDERS AND SHAREHOLDERS, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF REQUIRED PARTICIPATION

IN INSURANCE GUARANTY FUNDS AND THE INVOLUNTARY ASSUMPTION OF HARD-TO-PLACE OR

HIGH-RISK INSURANCE BUSINESS, PRIMARILY IN WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE

LINES.  THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DEBT

SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET

OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY FUTURE DIVIDENDS.

LOSS OR SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTION OF THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN THE

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING OF PERSONAL LINES PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE

PROFITABILITY

. IN

PERSONAL LINES, WE USE CREDIT SCORING AS A FACTOR IN PRICING DECISIONS WHERE

ALLOWED BY STATE LAW. SOME CONSUMER GROUPS AND REGULATORS HAVE QUESTIONED

WHETHER THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH

LOW INCOMES, MINORITY GROUPS AND THE ELDERLY AND ARE CALLING FOR THE

PROHIBITION OR RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN UNDERWRITING AND

PRICING. LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL THE USE OF CREDIT

SCORING, IF ENACTED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF STATES, COULD

REDUCE

OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR DISTRIBUTORS,

INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US

.  WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY

THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN THROUGH FEWER THAN A DOZEN

SUCH INTERMEDIARIES.  LOSS OF ALL OR A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDED THROUGH SUCH AGENTS AND BROKERS

COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY.

43

IF WE EXPERIENCE

DIFFICULTIES WITH OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR

BUSINESS MIGHT BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

WE OUTSOURCE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS

TO THIRD PARTIES AND MAY DO SO INCREASINGLY IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DO NOT

EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT OUR OUTSOURCING STRATEGY, THIRD PARTY

PROVIDERS DO NOT PERFORM AS ANTICIPATED OR WE EXPERIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER

PROBLEMS WITH A TRANSITION, WE MAY NOT REALIZE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS OR

COST EFFICIENCIES AND MAY EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, INCREASED COSTS

AND A LOSS OF BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION, OUR

ABILITY TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THIRD

PARTY PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE IMPACTED BY CULTURAL

DIFFERENCES, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, UNANTICIPATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR

POLICIES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.  AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR

BUSINESS MIGHT BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

ON JULY 23, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT

WAS SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF

THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATE PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $1.63

BILLION ($1.07 BILLION AFTER-TAX). THE COMPANY RECORDED THESE ADJUSTMENTS AS

CHARGES IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004.

THROUGH AN INFORMAL COMMENT PROCESS, THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION

FINANCE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, WHICH THE COMPANY HAS

PROVIDED. SPECIFICALLY, THE STAFF HAS ASKED FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE

COMPANYS ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN OF SPCS INSURANCE RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND PREMIUMS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AND HOW THOSE

ADJUSTMENTS MAY RELATE TO SPCS RESERVES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER. AFTER

REVIEWING THE STAFFS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMPANYS

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT FOR THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE. IF, HOWEVER, THE STAFF DISAGREES,

SOME OR ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS BEING DISCUSSED MAY NOT BE RECORDED AS CHARGES

IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, THEREBY INCREASING NET

INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2004 AND INCREASING SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, IN EACH CASE BY THE APPROXIMATE

AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF THE CHANGE. THE EFFECT ON TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

(ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTS OF DEFERRED TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004 WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL.

INCREASES TO GOODWILL AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WOULD BE REFLECTED ON THE

COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET AS OF APRIL 1, 2004, EITHER DUE TO PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING OR ADJUSTMENT OF SPCS RESERVES PRIOR TO THE MERGER.

44

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

THE COMPANY OWNS ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS

BUILDINGS LOCATED AT 385 WASHINGTON STREET AND 130 WEST SIXTH STREET, ST. PAUL,

MINNESOTA. THESE BUILDINGS ARE ADJACENT TO ONE ANOTHER AND CONSIST OF

APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GROSS FLOOR SPACE.  THE COMPANY ALSO OWNED PROPERTIES IN

WOODBURY, MINNESOTA, WHERE AN ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES BUILDING AND OFF-SITE

COMPUTER PROCESSING OPERATIONS WERE LOCATED. THE WOODBURY PROPERTIES WERE SOLD

IN APRIL OF 2005.

THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS SIX BUILDINGS IN HARTFORD,

CONNECTICUT. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY OCCUPIES APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SQUARE

FEET OF OFFICE SPACE IN THESE BUILDINGS. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS OTHER REAL

PROPERTY, WHICH INCLUDES OFFICE BUILDINGS IN FALL RIVER, MASSACHUSETTS, AND IN

IRVING, TEXAS, AND A DATA CENTER LOCATED IN NORCROSS, GEORGIA. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY LEASES 220 FIELD AND CLAIM OFFICES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 5.1 MILLION

SQUARE FEET THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES UNDER LEASES OR SUBLEASES WITH THIRD PARTIES.

THE COMPANY OWNS A BUILDING IN LONDON, ENGLAND,

WHICH HOUSES A PORTION OF ITS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OWNS AN

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF INCOME-PRODUCING PROPERTIES AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS.

INCLUDED IN THIS PORTFOLIO ARE FOUR OFFICE BUILDINGS IN WHICH THE COMPANY HOLDS

A 50% OWNERSHIP INTEREST LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK, WHICH COLLECTIVELY

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PROPERTY PORTFOLIO

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, THE

COMPANYS PROPERTIES ARE ADEQUATE AND SUITABLE FOR ITS BUSINESS AS PRESENTLY

CONDUCTED AND ARE ADEQUATELY MAINTAINED.

45

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THIS SECTION DESCRIBES THE MAJOR PENDING LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS,

TO WHICH THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS A PARTY OR TO WHICH ANY OF

THE COMPANYS PROPERTY IS SUBJECT.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED

PROCEEDINGS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS,

THE COMPANY RECEIVES CLAIMS FOR INSURANCE ARISING UNDER POLICIES ISSUED BY THE

COMPANY ASSERTING ALLEGED INJURIES AND DAMAGES FROM ASBESTOS, HAZARDOUS WASTE

AND OTHER TOXIC SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF RELATED COVERAGE

LITIGATION, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LITIGATION DESCRIBED BELOW.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO

AGGRESSIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED LITIGATION.

THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE

RELATED LITIGATION CONTINUE TO CHANGE.

TPC IS INVOLVED IN THREE SIGNIFICANT PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING

A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING) RELATING TO ACANDS, INC. (ACANDS), FORMERLY A

NATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR AND INSTALLER OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS.  THE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE DISPUTES AS TO

WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT ANY OF ACANDS POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR CURRENT OR

FUTURE BODILY INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED

BY TPC.  THE STATUS OF THE VARIOUS

PROCEEDINGS IS DESCRIBED BELOW.

ACANDS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN SEPTEMBER 2002 (

IN RE: ACANDS, INC.,

PENDING IN THE

U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE).  IN ITS PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION,

ACANDS SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A TRUST TO PAY ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST

IT AND SOUGHT TO ASSIGN TO THE TRUST ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE INSURANCE POLICIES

ISSUED BY TPC.  THE PROPOSED PLAN AND

DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FILED BY ACANDS CLAIMED THAT ACANDS HAD SETTLED THE VAST

MAJORITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT

FOR APPROXIMATELY $2.80 BILLION.  ACANDS

ASSERTS THAT, BASED ON A PRIOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN TPC AND ACANDS AND ACANDS

INTERPRETATION OF THE JULY 31, 2003 ARBITRATION PANEL RULING DESCRIBED

BELOW, TPC IS LIABLE FOR 45% OF THE $2.80 BILLION.  ON JANUARY 26, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT ISSUED A DECISION REJECTING CONFIRMATION OF ACANDS PROPOSED PLAN OF

REORGANIZATION.  THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

FOUND, CONSISTENT WITH TPCS OBJECTIONS TO ACANDS PROPOSED PLAN, THAT THE

PROPOSED PLAN WAS NOT FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR, WAS NOT PROPOSED IN GOOD FAITH AND

DID NOT COMPLY WITH SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE.  ACANDS HAS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL OF THE

BANKRUPTCY COURTS DECISION AND HAS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS

FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT.  TPC HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE

APPEAL AND OBJECTIONS AND HAS ALSO FILED AN OPPOSITION TO ACANDS OBJECTIONS.

AN ARBITRATION WAS COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2001 TO

DETERMINE WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT ACANDS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR BODILY

INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INSURANCE POLICY AGGREGATE LIMITS.  ON JULY 31, 2003, THE ARBITRATION PANEL

RULED IN FAVOR OF TPC THAT ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST ACANDS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE AGGREGATE LIMITS OF THE POLICIES ISSUED TO ACANDS, WHICH HAVE

BEEN EXHAUSTED.  IN OCTOBER 2003,

ACANDS COMMENCED A LAWSUIT SEEKING TO VACATE THE ARBITRATION AWARD AS BEYOND

THE PANELS SCOPE OF AUTHORITY (

ACANDS, INC.

V. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.,

U.S.D.CT. E.D. PA.).  ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, THE DISTRICT

COURT ENTERED AN ORDER DENYING ACANDS MOTION TO VACATE THE ARBITRATION

AWARD.  ON JANUARY 19, 2006, THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT REVERSED THE DISTRICT

COURTS DECISION AND DECLARED THE ARBITRATION AWARD VOID ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS.

ON FEBRUARY 8, 2006, TPC FILED A

MOTION TO STAY THE ISSUANCE OF THE THIRD CIRCUITS MANDATE IN ANTICIPATION OF TPCS

PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

IN THE OTHER PROCEEDING, A RELATED CASE PENDING

BEFORE THE SAME COURT AND COMMENCED IN SEPTEMBER 2000 (

ACANDS V. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.

,

U.S.D.CT., E.D. PA.), ACANDS SOUGHT A DECLARATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE

ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST ACANDS ARE SUBJECT TO OCCURRENCE LIMITS

UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC.

TPC FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION BASED UPON THE JULY 31,

2003 ARBITRATION DECISION DESCRIBED ABOVE.

THE DISTRICT COURT FOUND THE DISPUTE WAS MOOT AS A RESULT OF THE

ARBITRATION PANELS DECISION.  THE

DISTRICT COURT, THEREFORE, BASED ON THE ARBITRATION PANELS DECISION, DISMISSED

THE CASE. IF THE JANUARY 19, 2006 RULING OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT DESCRIBED IN

THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE SURVIVES FURTHER APPEAL, THIS CASE WILL BE REINSTATED.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IT HAS MERITORIOUS

POSITIONS IN THESE ACANDS-RELATED PROCEEDINGS AND INTENDS TO LITIGATE

VIGOROUSLY.

46

IN OCTOBER 2001 AND APRIL 2002, TWO

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS (

WISE V.

TRAVELERS

AND

MENINGER V.

TRAVELERS

), WERE FILED AGAINST TPC AND OTHER INSURERS (NOT INCLUDING

SPC) IN STATE COURT IN WEST VIRGINIA.

THESE CASES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE PROCEEDING IN

THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA.  PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE INSURER DEFENDANTS

ENGAGED IN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BY INAPPROPRIATELY HANDLING AND SETTLING

ASBESTOS CLAIMS.  THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO

REOPEN LARGE NUMBERS OF SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR

DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, DIRECTLY ON INSURERS.  LAWSUITS SIMILAR TO

WISE

WERE FILED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND

HAWAII (THESE SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII

ACTIONS).  ALSO, IN

NOVEMBER

2001, PLAINTIFFS IN CONSOLIDATED ASBESTOS

ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE A MASS TORT PANEL OF JUDGES IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT

MOVED TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT TO NAME TPC AS A DEFENDANT, ALLEGING THAT TPC

AND OTHER INSURERS BREACHED ALLEGED DUTIES TO CERTAIN USERS OF ASBESTOS

PRODUCTS.  IN MARCH 2002, THE COURT

GRANTED THE MOTION TO AMEND.  PLAINTIFFS

SEEK DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF AND RAISING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE

PRESENTED IN THE WEST VIRGINIA AMENDED COMPLAINT ARE ALSO PENDING IN OHIO STATE

COURT AGAINST TPC AND SPC, IN TEXAS STATE COURT AGAINST TPC AND SPC, AND IN

LOUISIANA STATE COURT AGAINST TPC (THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THESE SUITS, TOGETHER

WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA SUIT, ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE COMMON LAW

CLAIMS).

ALL OF THE ACTIONS AGAINST TPC DESCRIBED IN THE

PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, OTHER THAN THE HAWAII ACTIONS, HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO A

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER ENTERED BY THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT IN NEW YORK

THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY PRESIDED OVER AND APPROVED THE REORGANIZATION IN BANKRUPTCY

OF TPCS FORMER POLICYHOLDER JOHNS-MANVILLE CORPORATION AND AFFILIATED

ENTITIES.  IN AUGUST 2002, THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT HELD A HEARING ON TPCS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

PROHIBITING FURTHER PROSECUTION OF THE LAWSUITS PURSUANT TO THE REORGANIZATION

PLAN AND RELATED ORDERS.  AT THE

CONCLUSION OF THIS HEARING, THE COURT ORDERED THE PARTIES TO MEDIATION,

APPOINTED A MEDIATOR AND CONTINUED THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER.  DURING 2003, THE SAME BANKRUPTCY COURT

EXTENDED THE EXISTING INJUNCTION TO APPLY TO AN ADDITIONAL SET OF CASES FILED

IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS IN TEXAS AND OHIO AS WELL AS TO THE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE

PROSECUTING THESE CASES.  THE ORDER ALSO

ENJOINED THESE ATTORNEYS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE LAW FIRMS FROM COMMENCING ANY

FURTHER LAWSUITS AGAINST TPC BASED UPON THESE ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT THE PRIOR

APPROVAL OF THE COURT.  NOTWITHSTANDING

THE INJUNCTION, ADDITIONAL COMMON LAW CLAIMS WERE FILED AND SERVED ON TPC.

ON NOVEMBER 19, 2003, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT A SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS HAD BEEN

REACHED.  THIS SETTLEMENT INCLUDES A LUMP

SUM PAYMENT OF UP TO $412 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

CONTINGENCIES.  AFTER CONTINUED MEETINGS

WITH THE MEDIATOR, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON MAY 25,

2004 THAT A SETTLEMENT RESOLVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PENDING AND SIMILAR FUTURE

COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC HAD ALSO BEEN REACHED.  THIS SETTLEMENT REQUIRES A PAYMENT OF UP TO

$90 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES.  EACH OF THESE SETTLEMENTS IS CONTINGENT UPON,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ORDER OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CLARIFYING THAT ALL OF

THESE CLAIMS, AND SIMILAR FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, ARE

BARRED BY PRIOR ORDERS ENTERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ORIGINAL JOHNS-MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.

ON AUGUST 17, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

ENTERED AN ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS AND CLARIFYING ITS PRIOR ORDERS THAT

ALL OF THE PENDING STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON

LAW CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST TPC ARE BARRED.

THE ORDER ALSO APPLIES TO SIMILAR DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED

IN THE FUTURE.

FOUR APPEALS WERE TAKEN FROM THE AUGUST 17,

2004 RULING.  THESE APPEALS HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATED AND ARE CURRENTLY PENDING.

THE PARTIES HAVE COMPLETED BRIEFING ALL OF THE ISSUES AND A HEARING WAS

HELD BEFORE THE DISTRICT COURT ON FEBRUARY 22, 2006.  THE COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY OF

THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS UNLESS AND UNTIL THE ORDERS AND RELIEF BECOME FINAL AND

ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY FURTHER APPELLATE REVIEW.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW APPELLATE

COURTS WILL RULE ON THE PENDING APPEALS.

SPC, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

RULINGS OR THE SETTLEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, HAS NUMEROUS DEFENSES IN ALL OF THE

DIRECT ACTION CASES ASSERTING COMMON LAW CLAIMS THAT ARE PENDING AGAINST

IT.  SPCS DEFENSES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT

THESE NOVEL THEORIES HAVE NO BASIS IN LAW; THAT THEY ARE DIRECTLY AT ODDS WITH

THE WELL-ESTABLISHED LAW PERTAINING TO THE INSURED/INSURER RELATIONSHIP; THAT

THERE IS NO GENERALIZED DUTY TO WARN AS ALLEGED BY THE PLAINTIFFS; AND THAT THE

APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AS TO MANY OF THESE CLAIMS HAS LONG SINCE

EXPIRED. MANY OF THESE DEFENSES HAVE BEEN RAISED IN INITIAL MOTIONS TO DISMISS

FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS.  THERE

HAVE BEEN FAVORABLE RULINGS DURING 2003 AND 2004 IN TEXAS AND DURING 2004 AND

2005 IN OHIO ON SOME OF THESE MOTIONS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS THAT

DEALT WITH STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND THE VALIDITY OF THE ALLEGED CAUSES OF

ACTIONS.  ON MAY 26, 2005, THE COURT

OF APPEALS OF OHIO, EIGHTH DISTRICT, AFFIRMED THE EARLIEST OF THESE FAVORABLE

RULINGS.  IN TEXAS, ONLY ONE COURT, IN JUNE OF

2005, HAS DENIED THE INSURERS INITIAL CHALLENGES TO THE PLEADINGS.  THAT RULING WAS CONTRARY TO THE RULINGS BY

OTHER COURTS IN SIMILAR CASES, AND SPC INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO DEFEND THIS CASE

VIGOROUSLY.

47

THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING ITS ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF THESE DISPUTES IS UNCERTAIN.  IN THIS REGARD, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED

SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE, INCLUDING SETTLING LITIGATION UNDER APPROPRIATE

CIRCUMSTANCES.  FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE, SEE ITEM

2  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS  ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION,  ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION AND  UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES.

CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT LEGAL

OUTCOMES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

ANY SUCH DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND

INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION.  BECAUSE OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL

LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED

RESERVES.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS

ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE.  THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN

ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD

RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION AND RELATED

PROCEEDINGS

TPC AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WERE NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN THREE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY SHAREHOLDERS

ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC

AND SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS WELL AS UNSPECIFIED MONETARY DAMAGES.

THE ACTIONS WERE CAPTIONED

HENZEL, ET AL. V.

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., ET AL.

(JUD. DIST. OF WATERBURY,

CT. NOV. 17, 2003);

VOZZOLO V.

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., ET AL.

(JUD. DIST. OF WATERBURY,

CT. NOV. 17, 2003); AND

FARINA V.

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., ET AL.

(JUD. DIST. OF WATERBURY,

CT. DECEMBER 15, 2003).  THE

FARINA

COMPLAINT ALSO NAMED SPC AND ITS FORMER SUBSIDIARY, ADAMS

ACQUISITION CORP., AS DEFENDANTS, ALLEGING THAT THEY AIDED AND ABETTED THE

ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY.  ON MARCH 18, 2004, TPC AND SPC

ANNOUNCED THAT ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS HAD BEEN SETTLED, SUBJECT TO COURT

APPROVAL. BEFORE COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT, ADDITIONAL SHAREHOLDER

LITIGATION WAS COMMENCED, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2005, PLAINTIFFS VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW THEIR

COMPLAINTS WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

BEGINNING IN AUGUST 2004, FOLLOWING POST-MERGER

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY COMMENCED

FOURTEEN PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.  PLAINTIFF SHAREHOLDERS ALLEGED THAT

CERTAIN DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THE APRIL 2004 MERGER BETWEEN TPC AND SPC

CONTAINED FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE VALUE OF SPCS

LOSS RESERVES IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS.  THESE ACTIONS WERE

CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION I,

AND A LEAD PLAINTIFF AND

LEAD COUNSEL WERE APPOINTED.  AN ADDITIONAL PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION BASED ON

THE SAME ALLEGATIONS WAS BROUGHT IN NEW YORK STATE SUPREME COURT.  THIS

ACTION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFERRED TO THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA AND WAS

CONSOLIDATED WITH

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS

SECURITIES LITIGATION I.

ON JUNE 24, 2005, THE LEAD

PLAINTIFF FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT.  THE COMPLAINT DID NOT

SPECIFY DAMAGES.  ON AUGUST 23,

2005, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

IN

RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION

I

MOVED TO DISMISS THE AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT.

ON

NOVEMBER 22, 2005, THE PARTIES REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE CASE.

THE SETTLEMENT ALSO ENCOMPASSES THE

HENZEL

,

VOZZOLO

AND

FARINA

CASES

DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ON DECEMBER 28, 2005, THE

COURT APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT.

THREE OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE PENDING IN THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.  TWO OF THESE

ACTIONS, WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY CAPTIONED

KAHN V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(NOV. 2,

2004) AND

MICHAEL A. BERNSTEIN PROFIT

SHARING PLAN V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(NOV. 10, 2004), ARE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT BY CERTAIN

SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND

FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.  THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED AS

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION II

,

AND A LEAD PLAINTIFF AND LEAD COUNSEL HAVE BEEN APPOINTED.  ON JULY 11,

2005, THE LEAD PLAINTIFF FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT.  THE AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ALLEGES

VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS ALLEGED

FAILURE TO MAKE DISCLOSURE RELATING TO THE PRACTICE OF PAYING BROKERS

COMMISSIONS ON A CONTINGENT BASIS, THE COMPANYS ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN A

CONSPIRACY TO RIG BIDS AND THE COMPANYS

48

ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER USE OF FINITE REINSURANCE

PRODUCTS. ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2005, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

IN

RE ST. PAUL

TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION II

MOVED TO DISMISS THE AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM. IN THE THIRD OF THESE

ACTIONS, AN ALLEGED BENEFICIARY OF THE COMPANYS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN COMMENCED

A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND

FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CAPTIONED

SPIZIRI V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(DEC. 28,

2004). THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME

SECURITY ACT BASED ON ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION I.

ON JUNE 1,

2005, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

SPIZIRI

MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT. ON JANUARY 4, 2006, THE

PARTIES IN

SPIZIRI

ENTERED INTO A STIPULATION OF

SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT REMAINS SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL.

IN ADDITION, TWO DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN

BROUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA

AGAINST ALL OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

FORMER DIRECTORS, NAMING THE COMPANY AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT.

ROWE V. FISHMAN, ET AL.

(OCT. 22,

2004) AND

CLARK V. FISHMAN, ET AL.

(NOV. 18, 2004). THE DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR

PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS AS

ROWE, ET AL. V.

FISHMAN, ET AL

. AND A CONSOLIDATED DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN

FILED. THE CONSOLIDATED DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT ASSERTS STATE LAW CLAIMS,

INCLUDING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, BASED ON ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE

ALLEGED IN

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS

SECURITIES LITIGATION I AND II

DESCRIBED ABOVE. ON JUNE 10,

2005, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

ROWE

MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT. ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE MOTION TO

DISMISS WAS PRESENTED ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2005.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PENDING LAWSUITS HAVE

NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO

PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A

FUTURE PERIOD. THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED UNDER MINNESOTA LAW. AS PART OF THAT OBLIGATION,

THE COMPANY WILL ADVANCE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER

EXPENSES THEY INCUR IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS.

OTHER

PROCEEDINGS

FROM TIME TO TIME THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN

PROCEEDINGS ADDRESSING DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY BE

INITIATED BY THE COMPANY OR THE REINSURERS AND MAY INVOLVE THE TERMS OF

THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THE COVERAGE OF PARTICULAR CLAIMS, EXCLUSIONS UNDER

THE AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS COUNTERCLAIMS FOR RESCISSION OF THE AGREEMENTS. ONE

OF THESE DISPUTES IS THE ACTION DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH.

THE COMPANYS GULF OPERATION BROUGHT AN ACTION ON MAY 22,

2003, AS AMENDED ON MAY 12, 2004, IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, COUNTY

OF NEW YORK (

GULF INSURANCE COMPANY V.

TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL.

), AGAINST TRANSATLANTIC

REINSURANCE COMPANY (TRANSATLANTIC), XL REINSURANCE AMERICA, INC. (XL),

ODYSSEY AMERICA REINSURANCE CORPORATION (ODYSSEY), EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE

COMPANY (EMPLOYERS) AND GERLING GLOBAL REINSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA

(GERLING), TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE UNDER REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF

AND RELATED TO GULFS FEBRUARY 2003 SETTLEMENT OF A COVERAGE DISPUTE UNDER

A VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE PROTECTION INSURANCE POLICY. THE REINSURERS HAVE

ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING RESCISSION OF THE VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF

CONTRACT. SEPARATE ACTIONS FILED BY TRANSATLANTIC AND GERLING HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED

WITH THE ORIGINAL GULF ACTION FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES. ON OCTOBER 1, 2003,

GULF ENTERED INTO A FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH EMPLOYERS, AND ALL CLAIMS

AND COUNTERCLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.

ON MAY 26, 2004, THE COURT DENIED GULFS MOTION

TO DISMISS CERTAIN CLAIMS ASSERTED BY TRANSATLANTIC AND A JOINT MOTION BY

TRANSATLANTIC, XL AND ODYSSEY FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST GULF. DISCOVERY IS

CURRENTLY PROCEEDING IN THE MATTERS. GULF DENIES THE REINSURERS ALLEGATIONS,

BELIEVES THAT IT HAS A STRONG LEGAL BASIS TO COLLECT THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THE ACTIONS.

BASED ON THE COMPANYS BELIEFS ABOUT ITS LEGAL

POSITIONS IN ITS VARIOUS REINSURANCE RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT ANY OF THESE MATTERS TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

49

AS PART OF ONGOING, INDUSTRY-WIDE

INVESTIGATIONS, THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND

WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES. THE

AREAS OF INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS

AND AGENTS, THE COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT WITH NON-TRADITIONAL INSURANCE AND

REINSURANCE PRODUCTS, BRANDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SALVAGE AUTOMOBILES AND THE

REPORTING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION PREMIUMS.  THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED

SUBPOENAS OR WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION, IN EACH CASE WITH RESPECT TO ONE

OR MORE OF THE AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE, FROM: (I) STATE OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE

OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (II) STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE;

(III) LICENSING AND MARKET CONDUCT COMPLIANCE DIVISION, FINANCIAL SERVICES

COMMISSION OF ONTARIO, CANADA; (IV) STATE OF CONNECTICUT INSURANCE

DEPARTMENT; (V) STATE OF CONNECTICUT OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (VI) STATE

OF DELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE; (VII) STATE OF FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF

FINANCIAL SERVICES; (VIII) STATE OF FLORIDA OFFICE OF INSURANCE REGULATION;

(IX) STATE OF FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF LEGAL AFFAIRS OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY

GENERAL; (X) STATE OF GEORGIA OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE;

(XI) STATE OF ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL

REGULATION; (XII) STATE OF IOWA INSURANCE DIVISION; (XIII) STATE OF MARYLAND

INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION; (XIV) COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS OFFICE OF THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XV) STATE OF MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE; (XVI) STATE

OF MINNESOTA OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XVII) STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

INSURANCE DEPARTMENT; (XVIII) STATE OF NEW YORK OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL;

(XIX) STATE OF NEW YORK INSURANCE DEPARTMENT; (XX) STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA

DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE; (XXI) STATE OF OHIO OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL;

(XXII) STATE OF OHIO DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE; (XXIII) COMMONWEALTH OF

PENNSYLVANIA OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XXIV) STATE OF TEXAS DEPARTMENT

OF INSURANCE; (XXV) STATE OF WASHINGTON OFFICE OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER;

(XXVI) STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XXVII) THE UNITED

STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK; AND (XXVIII) THE UNITED

STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAY RECEIVE

ADDITIONAL SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE AREAS

DESCRIBED ABOVE FROM OTHER AGENCIES OR AUTHORITIES.

THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, OUTSIDE COUNSEL, WITH THE OVERSIGHT OF

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES. THIS REVIEW INITIALLY FOCUSED ON

THE COMPANYS RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND WAS COMMENCED AFTER THE

ANNOUNCEMENT OF LITIGATION BROUGHT BY THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE

AGAINST A MAJOR BROKER.

THE INTERNAL REVIEW WAS EXPANDED TO ADDRESS THE

VARIOUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION DESCRIBED ABOVE AND TO VERIFY WHETHER THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THESE AREAS HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANYS

REVIEW HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE, INVOLVING THE EXAMINATION OF E-MAILS AND

UNDERWRITING FILES, AS WELL AS INTERVIEWS OF CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES. THE

COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO RECEIVE AND RESPOND TO ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION AND WILL EXPAND ITS REVIEW ACCORDINGLY.

TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS FOUND ONLY A FEW INSTANCES

OF CONDUCT THAT WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE CODE OF CONDUCT. THE

COMPANY HAS RESPONDED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO RESPOND, APPROPRIATELY TO ANY SUCH

CONDUCT.

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL REVIEW WITH RESPECT TO FINITE

REINSURANCE CONSIDERED FINITE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY BOTH PURCHASED AND SOLD. THE

COMPANY HAS COMPLETED ITS REVIEW WITH RESPECT TO THE IDENTIFIED FINITE PRODUCTS

PURCHASED AND SOLD, AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT NO ADJUSTMENT TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS REQUIRED. THE RELATED INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS

PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED ARE ONGOING, AS ARE THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO COOPERATE

WITH THE AUTHORITIES, AND THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES COULD ASK THAT ADDITIONAL

WORK BE PERFORMED OR REACH CONCLUSIONS DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPANYS. ACCORDINGLY,

IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO REACH ANY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF

THESE MATTERS.

SIX PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND TWO

INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS WERE BROUGHT AGAINST A NUMBER OF INSURANCE BROKERS AND INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, BY PLAINTIFFS WHO

ALLEGEDLY PURCHASED INSURANCE PRODUCTS THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE DEFENDANT

BROKERS. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT VARIOUS INSURANCE BROKERS CONSPIRED WITH EACH

OTHER AND WITH VARIOUS INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS

AFFILIATES, TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE PREMIUMS, ALLOCATE BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS AND

RIG BIDS FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS OFFERED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. FIVE OF THE CLASS ACTIONS

WERE FILED IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT, AND THE COMPLAINTS ARE CAPTIONED.

SHELL VACATIONS LLC

,

LATER VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED ITS COMPLAINT. TO THE EXTENT THEY WERE NOT

ORIGINALLY FILED THERE, THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTIONS WERE TRANSFERRED BY THE

FOR THE DISTRICT OF

50

NEW JERSEY AND HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH OTHER CLASS ACTIONS

UNDER THE CAPTION

PLAINTIFFS IN THE ABOVE-REFERENCED CLASS ACTIONS, FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT NAMING VARIOUS BROKERS AND INSURERS, INCLUDING THE

COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, ON BEHALF OF A PUTATIVE NATIONWIDE CLASS OF

POLICYHOLDERS. THE COMPLAINT INCLUDES CAUSES OF ACTION UNDER THE SHERMAN ACT,

THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT, STATE COMMON LAW AND

THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS STATES PROHIBITING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. PLAINTIFFS

SEEK MONETARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND TREBLED DAMAGES,

PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, RESTITUTION, INCLUDING DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS,

INTEREST AND COSTS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. ON NOVEMBER 29, 2005, ALL

DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM. ON

FEBRUARY 13, 2006, THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS MOVED TO CERTIFY A NATIONWIDE CLASS

CONSISTING OF ALL PERSONS WHO BETWEEN AUGUST 26, 1994 AND THE DATE OF CLASS

CERTIFICATION ENGAGED THE SERVICES OF A BROKER DEFENDANT (OR RELATED ENTITY) IN

CONNECTION WITH THE PROCUREMENT OR RENEWAL OF INSURANCE AND WHO ENTERED INTO OR

RENEWED A CONTRACT OF INSURANCE WITH ONE OR MORE OF THE INSURER DEFENDANTS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY.

ONE

COMPANYS AFFILIATES, WAS FILED IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT AND IS CAPTIONED

DELTA PRIDE CATFISH, INC. V. MARSH USA, INC., ET AL.

(D.

MISS. SEPT. 13, 2005).  THAT ACTION HAS

ALSO BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY AND IS BEING COORDINATED

WITH

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

.  ON JANUARY 17, 2006, ALL DEFENDANTS MOVED TO

DISMISS THE COMPLAINT IN

ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE ASSERTED IN

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE

ANTITRUST LITIGATION

AGAINST VARIOUS BROKERS AND INSURERS, INCLUDING

THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN CONSOLIDATED

WITH

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

.  CERTAIN DEFENDANTS IN

BENSLEY CONSTRUCTION, INC.

, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, HAVE REMOVED

THE ACTION TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

MASSACHUSETTS.  ON FEBRUARY 13, 2006, THE

ACTION WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY FOR COORDINATION WITH

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION.

OFFICE DEPOT, INC.

WAS BROUGHT IN FLORIDA STATE COURT AND NAMES SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS

SUBSIDIARIES.  ON NOVEMBER 9, 2005, THE

COURT ENTERED AN ORDER STAYING

OFFICE DEPOT

PENDING RESOLUTION OF

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE

ANTITRUST LITIGATION

.  THE

PLAINTIFF IN

OFFICE DEPOT, INC.

HAS

APPEALED.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY.

IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY IS

INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS, NOT INVOLVING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS,

ARISING MOSTLY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS EITHER AS A

LIABILITY INSURER DEFENDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS,

THE COMPANYS DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO ALL ITEMS,

OTHER THAN NET INCOME, INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, INCOME (LOSS) FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, AND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), ARE PRESENTED ON

A PRETAX BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION,

THE COMPANY REFERENCES THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER, WHICH IN THE CONTEXT OF A

COMPARISON BETWEEN 2005 AND 2004 REFERS TO THE COMPANYS 2005 RESULTS

REFLECTING A FULL YEAR OF COMBINED POST-MERGER OPERATIONS, WHEREAS THE COMPANYS

2004 RESULTS REFLECT COMBINED POST-MERGER OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS

SUBSEQUENT TO THE APRIL 1, 2004 MERGER DATE, PLUS THE RESULTS OF TPC ONLY

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004. IN THE CONTEXT OF A COMPARISON

BETWEEN 2004 AND 2003, THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER REFERS TO THE COMPANYS 2004

RESULTS REFLECTING THE COMPONENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHEREAS THE COMPANYS 2003

RESULTS INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF TPC ONLY FOR THE FULL YEAR.

57

OVERVIEW

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2005 TOTALED

$2.06 BILLION, OR $2.95 PER SHARE DILUTED, COMPARED WITH INCOME FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS OF $867 MILLION, OR $1.40 PER SHARE DILUTED, IN 2004. THE INCREASE

IN INCOME IN 2005 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER, IMPROVED NON-CATASTROPHE

CURRENT YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE COMPANYS THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, A

DECLINE IN NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND STRONG GROWTH IN

NET INVESTMENT INCOME. THESE FACTORS MORE THAN OFFSET A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

THE COST OF CATASTROPHES (INCLUDING REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS AND STATE

ASSESSMENTS), WHICH TOTALED $2.19 BILLION IN 2005, COMPARED WITH $772 MILLION

IN 2004. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2005 PRIMARILY RELATED TO HURRICANES KATRINA,

RITA AND WILMA, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE. NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 TOTALED $325 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $2.39 BILLION

IN 2004. THE 2005 TOTAL WAS DRIVEN BY A CHARGE OF $830 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN

ASBESTOS RESERVES AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL ASBESTOS LIABILITY

REVIEW, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OTHER NON-ASBESTOS RELATED NET FAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL SEGMENTS. THE NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2004 TOTAL WAS THE RESULT OF

SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT RESERVE CHARGES RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER AND WHICH

ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS EQUITY INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS,

WHICH CONSTITUTED ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET LOSS

FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF $439 MILLION IN 2005, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF

$710 MILLION OF TAX EXPENSE WHICH RESULTED FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TAX

BASIS AND THE GAAP CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $224 MILLION AFTER-TAX GAIN ON THE

DIVESTITURE AND THE COMPANYS SHARE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET INCOME FOR 2005.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF $88 MILLION IN 2004 REPRESENTED THE

COMPANYS SHARE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2004 TOTALED

$867 MILLION, OR $1.40 PER SHARE DILUTED, COMPARED WITH $1.70 BILLION, OR

$3.80 PER SHARE DILUTED, IN 2003. THE $829 MILLION DECLINE IN 2004 COMPARED

WITH 2003 WAS DRIVEN BY $2.39 BILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT. THAT NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2004 WAS

CONCENTRATED IN THE COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY SEGMENTS AND WAS PRIMARILY

COMPRISED OF $928 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES AS A RESULT OF THE

COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL ASBESTOS LIABILITY REVIEW, MERGER-RELATED

RESERVE STRENGTHENING OF $500 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION AND $300 MILLION FOR

SURETY, $290 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, $252 MILLION RELATED

TO THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR AND $113 MILLION

RELATED TO THE COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER. THESE CHARGES

ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS. IN ADDITION,

2004 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCLUDED $296 MILLION OF PRETAX CHARGES

TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES, POLICYHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND CO-SURETY PARTICIPATIONS ON A

SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR CLAIM. NET UNFAVORABLE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN

THE COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY SEGMENTS IN 2004 MORE THAN OFFSET ADDITIONAL

INCOME RESULTING FROM THE MERGER AND STRONG OPERATING INCOME GENERATED BY THE

COMPANYS PERSONAL SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COST OF CATASTROPHES IN 2004 OF

$772 MILLION WAS $420 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2003. THE CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN

2004 WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FOUR HURRICANES THAT STRUCK THE SOUTHEASTERN

UNITED STATES IN THE THIRD QUARTER.

REVENUES

EARNED PREMIUMS

THE $1.30 BILLION INCREASE IN EARNED PREMIUMS IN

2005 OVER 2004 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER, WHICH WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN EARNED PREMIUMS IN THE COMMERCIAL

SEGMENTS RUNOFF OPERATIONS, WHERE BUSINESS IS INTENTIONALLY BEING NON-RENEWED,

AND A DECLINE IN COMMERCIALS ONGOING OPERATIONS DUE TO A LOWER LEVEL OF NET

WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN THE LAST HALF OF 2004 AND FIRST HALF OF 2005. EARNED

PREMIUMS IN 2005 WERE REDUCED BY $121 MILLION OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS RELATED

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE COST OF

CATASTROPHE SECTION OF THIS DISCUSSION. EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2004 WERE

REDUCED BY $76 MILLION OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS PRIMARILY RELATED TO RESERVE

CHARGES RECORDED IN THE SURETY OPERATION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE FACTORS

WERE THE IMPACTS OF NEW BUSINESS GROWTH AND INCREASED RETENTION IN MANY OF THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE OPERATIONS IN 2005. IN 2004, THE $6.49 BILLION GROWTH IN

EARNED PREMIUMS OVER 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER, AS WELL AS THE

EARNED PREMIUM EFFECT OF RATE INCREASES ON RENEWAL BUSINESS OVER THE PREVIOUS

12 MONTHS AND STRONG CUSTOMER RETENTION LEVELS THROUGHOUT A MAJORITY OF THE

MARKETS SERVED BY THE COMPANYS INSURANCE OPERATIONS.

58

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF $3.17 BILLION IN 2005 GREW $502 MILLION, OR

19%, OVER 2004, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN

INVESTED ASSETS OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS, HIGHER SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES

AND A DECLINE IN INVESTMENT EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN INVESTED ASSETS IN 2005

WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED STRONG OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS AND THE INVESTMENT OF THE

$2.40 BILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE DIVESTITURE OF THE COMPANYS EQUITY INTEREST

IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS. THE AVERAGE PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELD IN 2005 OF 4.7%

DECLINED SLIGHTLY FROM 4.8% IN 2004, DUE TO THE MATURITY OF HIGHER YIELDING

BONDS AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS. NET INVESTMENT INCOME

IN 2004 INCLUDED $111 MILLION FROM THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF ONE

INVESTMENT.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2004 INCREASED $794 MILLION

OVER 2003, LARGELY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN INVESTED ASSETS RESULTING FROM THE

MERGER. IN ADDITION, STRONG OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN 2004 CONTRIBUTED TO THE

GROWTH IN INVESTED ASSETS. THE AVERAGE PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELD IN 2004 OF 4.8%

DECLINED FROM 5.3% IN 2003, DUE TO A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TAX-EXEMPT

INVESTMENTS AND LOWER YIELDS ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND ALTERNATIVE

INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, SPCS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER WAS

RECORDED AT ITS FAIR VALUE AS OF THE MERGER DATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING, WHICH REDUCED THE COMPANYS REPORTED AVERAGE INVESTMENT YIELD IN

2004.

THE COMPANY ALLOCATES INVESTED ASSETS AND THE

RELATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME TO ITS IDENTIFIED BUSINESS SEGMENTS. PRETAX NET

INVESTMENT INCOME IS ALLOCATED BASED UPON AN INVESTABLE FUNDS CONCEPT, WHICH

TAKES INTO ACCOUNT LIABILITIES (NET OF NON-INVESTED ASSETS) AND APPROPRIATE

CAPITAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EACH SEGMENT. THE INVESTMENT YIELD FOR INVESTABLE

FUNDS REFLECTS THE DURATION OF THE LOSS RESERVES FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME THE LOSSES WERE INCURRED AND A+ RATED

CORPORATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THIS DURATION YIELD IS COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE

PORTFOLIO YIELD AND A NEW AVERAGE YIELD IS DETERMINED. IT IS THIS AVERAGE YIELD

THAT IS USED IN THE CALCULATION OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME ON INVESTABLE FUNDS.

FEE INCOME

FEE INCOME IN 2005 DECLINED 6% WHEN COMPARED WITH 2004, AS THE NATIONAL

ACCOUNTS MARKET, THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE COMPANYS FEE-BASED BUSINESS,

EXPERIENCED INCREASED COMPETITION, PARTICULARLY IN THE LARGE ACCOUNT SECTOR, AS

DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS. IN

2004, THE 26% INCREASE IN FEE INCOME REFLECTED HIGHER NEW BUSINESS LEVELS

RESULTING, IN PART, FROM A THIRD QUARTER 2003 RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION, AS

WELL AS RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES AND AN INCREASE IN WORKERS COMPENSATION

BUSINESS WRITTEN THROUGH STATE RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS.

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES)

NET PRETAX REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS IN 2005 TOTALED $17 MILLION, PRIMARILY

GENERATED FROM SALES OF VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND EQUITY SECURITIES. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY REALIZED A PRETAX GAIN OF $21 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF

ITS PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK OPERATION AND $13 MILLION OF PRETAX NET GAINS

RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS WHICH ARE MARKED TO MARKET AND

SETTLED DAILY. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS IN 2005 WERE REDUCED BY $109

MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES, WHICH WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE VENTURE CAPITAL

PORTFOLIO AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL LATER IN THIS DISCUSSION.

THE COMPANYS NET PRETAX REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES

OF $39 MILLION IN 2004 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING $80 MILLION,

WHEREAS NET PRETAX REALIZED GAINS OF $38 MILLION IN 2003 INCLUDED $90 MILLION

OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. NET PRETAX REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) IN 2004

AND 2003 ALSO INCLUDED NET LOSSES OF $44 MILLION AND $27 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE

NATURE OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN EACH YEAR IS INCLUDED IN THE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION LATER IN THIS DISCUSSION.

GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 BOTH INCREASED 7% OVER 2004,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. HOWEVER, GROSS AND NET WRITTEN

PREMIUM VOLUMES IN 2005 WERE DOWN WHEN COMPARED TO 2004 ON A PRO FORMA COMBINED

BASIS. THE DECLINES WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, REFLECTING THE

PLANNED NON-RENEWAL OF BUSINESS IN RUNOFF AND REDUCED PREMIUM VOLUME IN ONGOING

OPERATIONS DUE TO INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION,

PREMIUM

VOLUME IN THE SPECIALTY SEGMENTS CONSTRUCTION OPERATION WAS LOWER

THAN IN 2004 ON A PRO FORMA BASIS DUE TO THE NOW-COMPLETED PROCESS OF ALIGNING

THE UNDERWRITING PROFILE OF THE TWO PREDECESSOR COMPANIES.

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 WERE REDUCED BY

$121 MILLION OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS RELATED TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES DISCUSSED

LATER IN THIS NARRATIVE, WHEREAS 2004 NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME WAS REDUCED BY

$76 MILLION OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS PRIMARILY RELATED TO RESERVING ACTIONS IN

THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT. HOWEVER, PREMIUM VOLUME IN THE PERSONAL SEGMENT

INCREASED OVER 2004, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES AND UNIT

GROWTH IN THE HOMEOWNERS LINE OF BUSINESS. DURING 2005, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED

STRONG RETENTION LEVELS ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS, AS THE COMPANY FOCUSED ON

RETAINING ITS EXISTING BOOK OF WELL PRICED, PROFITABLE BUSINESS. NEW BUSINESS

LEVELS IN SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE OPERATIONS ALSO INCREASED OVER

2004. RATE INCREASES, HOWEVER, WERE GENERALLY LOWER IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004,

REFLECTING INCREASED COMPETITION AND MORE AGGRESSIVE PRICING IN THE MARKETPLACE.

RATES FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN SELECTED MARKETS DECLINED FROM 2004 LEVELS.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED CHANGES IN THE

TIMING AND STRUCTURE OF REINSURANCE PURCHASED IN THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT. THE

CHANGE IN STRUCTURE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN CEDED PREMIUMS IN 2005 WHEN

COMPARED WITH 2004. THE COMPANY ALSO MADE A MODEST ADJUSTMENT TO 2004 CEDED

WRITTEN PREMIUMS TO REPORT AT INCEPTION ALL CEDED WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE MINIMUM AMOUNTS REQUIRED TO BE CEDED. PREVIOUSLY,

CEDED WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR CERTAIN OF THESE AGREEMENTS WERE REPORTED OVER THE

LIFE OF THE CONTRACTS. THIS ADJUSTMENT AFFECTED ONLY THE STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE

OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS ON A QUARTER-BY-QUARTER BASIS; IT DID NOT AFFECT NET

WRITTEN PREMIUM AMOUNTS OVER THE LIVES OF THE RESPECTIVE AGREEMENTS, NOR DID IT

IMPACT GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS, EARNED PREMIUMS, OPERATING RESULTS OR CAPITAL. THE

ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE TO CONFORM THE STATISTICAL MEASUREMENT OF PRODUCTION 

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS  ACROSS THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES.

THE $5.81 BILLION, OR 44%, INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT

OF THE MERGER. ON A PRO FORMA COMBINED BASIS, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2004 WERE

LEVEL WITH 2003. BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS IN THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS

INSURANCE OPERATIONS REMAINED CONSISTENT WITH 2003 LEVELS. THE LEVEL OF RATE

INCREASES, HOWEVER, CONTINUED TO DECLINE DURING 2004, REFLECTING THE

INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN THE COMMERCIAL AND

SPECIALTY SEGMENTS IN 2004 DECLINED WHEN COMPARED WITH THE COMBINED NEW

BUSINESS VOLUME OF SPC AND TPC IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING THE COMPETITIVE

MARKETPLACE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW BUSINESS PREMIUMS IN 2003 FROM RENEWAL RIGHTS

TRANSACTIONS. THE NON-RENEWAL OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL PROPERTY, CONSTRUCTION AND

SURETY RISKS AS WELL AS CERTAIN PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS IN THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2004. PERSONAL

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED 17% IN 2004 OVER 2003, DUE TO STRONG ORGANIC

GROWTH, NEW BUSINESS RESULTING FROM A RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION, STRONG

BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS AND PRICE INCREASES.

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES OF $14.93 BILLION IN 2005 WERE

$512 MILLION LOWER THAN THE 2004 TOTAL OF $15.44 BILLION. THE 2005 TOTAL

INCLUDED $2.03 BILLION OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES, COMPARED WITH $761 MILLION OF

SUCH LOSSES IN 2004. THE COST OF CATASTROPHES IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN

THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE. THE 2005 TOTAL ALSO INCLUDED $325 MILLION OF NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, COMPARED WITH $2.39 BILLION OF NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2004. THE NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT AND

WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A CHARGE TO INCREASE ASBESTOS RESERVES AS A RESULT

OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL ASBESTOS LIABILITY REVIEW. THAT CHARGE WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY OTHER, NON-ASBESTOS RELATED, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT IN

THE PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL SEGMENTS. CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN

2005 ALSO REFLECTED IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR NON-CATASTROPHE

RELATED LOSS EXPERIENCE AS COMPARED WITH 2004.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES OF $15.44

BILLION IN 2004 WERE $6.32 BILLION HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2003 TOTAL,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE 2004 NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $2.39 BILLION INCLUDED A $928 MILLION CHARGE TO

INCREASE ASBESTOS RESERVES, A $290 MILLION CHARGE TO INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES, A CHARGE OF $252 MILLION RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF A

SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, AND CHARGES TO INCREASE CONSTRUCTION AND

SURETY RESERVES IN THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT BY $500 MILLION AND $300 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ALSO COMMUTED CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH A

MAJOR REINSURER IN 2004 RESULTING IN A $113 MILLION PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

60

CHARGE (IN ADDITION TO A CURRENT YEAR LOSS OF $40

MILLION). COMMUTATIONS ARE A COMPLETE AND FINAL SETTLEMENT WITH A REINSURER

THAT RESULTS IN A DISCHARGE OF ALL OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE TERMINATED

REINSURANCE AGREEMENT. THESE AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF 2004 UNFAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE SEGMENT

DISCUSSIONS THAT FOLLOW. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2003

TOTALED $476 MILLION AND WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF RESERVE STRENGTHENING AT

THE COMPANYS GULF SUBSIDIARY. THE 2004 TOTAL ALSO INCLUDED $761 MILLION OF

CATASTROPHE LOSSES (NET OF REINSURANCE), COMPARED WITH CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF

$352 MILLION IN 2003.

COST OF CATASTROPHES.

THE COMPANYS COST OF CATASTROPHES, NET

OF REINSURANCE AND INCLUDING REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS AND STATE ASSESSMENTS,

TOTALED $2.19 BILLION IN 2005, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HURRICANES KATRINA,

RITA AND WILMA. HURRICANE KATRINA MADE LANDFALL IN FLORIDA, LOUISIANA,

MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA IN AUGUST 2005, HURRICANE RITA MADE LANDFALL IN

TEXAS AND LOUISIANA IN SEPTEMBER 2005 AND HURRICANE WILMA MADE LANDFALL IN

FLORIDA IN OCTOBER 2005. IN 2004, THE COST OF CATASTROPHES, NET OF

REINSURANCE, TOTALED $772 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH RESULTED FROM FOUR HURRICANES 

CHARLEY, FRANCES, IVAN AND JEANNE  THAT ALSO MADE LANDFALL IN THE SOUTHEASTERN

UNITED STATES. IN 2003, HURRICANE ISABEL AND SEVERAL STORMS ACROSS THE UNITED

STATES ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE $352 MILLION COST OF CATASTROPHES. THE

COST OF CATASTROPHES WAS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN THE

RESPECTIVE PERIODS AS FOLLOWS.

THESE REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS, THE COMPANY HAS COVERAGE FOR ONE ADDITIONAL LIMIT

UNDER ITS CORPORATE CATASTROPHE TREATY AND CONTINUING PROTECTION UNDER MOST OF

ITS OTHER TREATIES. THE TERM OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT CORPORATE CATASTROPHE

TREATY EXPIRES ON JUNE 30, 2006. STATE ASSESSMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A

COMPONENT OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

THE $284 MILLION INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN

2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. IN

ADDITION, THE 2005 TOTAL INCLUDED $43 MILLION OF STATE ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO

CATASTROPHE LOSSES, AND ALSO REFLECTED INVESTMENTS MADE FOR PROCESS

RE-ENGINEERING AND TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT,

PRIMARILY IN THE PERSONAL SEGMENT. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

BENEFIT OF EXPENSE EFFICIENCIES ACHIEVED SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT IN PARTICULAR HAS REALIZED SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE SAVINGS

SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ELIMINATION OF

DUPLICATE FUNCTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COMBINED ORGANIZATION. INCLUDED IN THE 2005

AND 2004 TOTALS WERE $112 MILLION AND $92 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE

MERGER, AND A BENEFIT OF $12 MILLION AND $58 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ASSOCIATED

WITH THE ACCRETION OF THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE 2004 TOTAL INCLUDED A $62 MILLION

INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS FOR

LOSS-SENSITIVE BUSINESS (PRIMARILY HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS). THIS INCREASE

RESULTED FROM APPLYING THE COMPANYS CREDIT-BASED METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING

UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS TO THE RECOVERABLES ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER. GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2004 ALSO INCLUDED $29 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING

CHARGES RELATED TO THE MERGER.

61

OTHER 2004 CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

. OTHER ITEMS INCREASING THE 2004 CLAIMS AND EXPENSES COMPARED TO 2003

INCLUDE $296 MILLION OF CHARGES TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCES FOR ESTIMATED

AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, POLICYHOLDERS RECEIVABLES, AND

CO-SURETY PARTICIPATIONS ON A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR CLAIM. THE

INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES RECOGNIZED

A CHANGE IN ESTIMATED DISPUTES WITH REINSURERS AND IS BASED UPON THE COMPANYS

REINSURANCE STRATEGY OF REDUCED REINSURANCE UTILIZATION, INCLUDING THE

CESSATION OF ONGOING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN OF SPCS REINSURERS,

AND AGGRESSIVE COLLECTION OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. A CHARGE WAS ALSO

RECORDED TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS

FOR LOSS SENSITIVE BUSINESS (PRIMARILY HIGH DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS). THIS INCREASE

RECOGNIZED A CHANGE IN ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE AND RESULTED FROM

APPLYING THE COMPANYS CREDIT BASED METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING UNCOLLECTIBLE

AMOUNTS TO THE RECOVERABLES ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER. BECAUSE REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES AND AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS FOR LOSS SENSITIVE BUSINESS ARE

INSURANCE CONTRACT-RELATED ASSETS, THESE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME TYPES

OF ESTIMATION VARIABLES AS LOSS RESERVES. ALSO DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2004, A PARTICIPATING CO-SURETY ON A CONTRACT SURETY EXPOSURE ANNOUNCED THAT

INSURANCE REGULATORS HAD APPROVED ITS SUBMITTED RUN-OFF PLAN. BASED UPON

INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE OF THE CO-SURETYS RUN-OFF PLAN AND AN ANALYSIS OF THE

CO-SURETYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY TO

COLLECT THE FULL AMOUNT PROJECTED TO BE OWED BY THE CO-SURETY AND ESTABLISHED

AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESERVES.

INTEREST EXPENSE

THE $50 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2005 OVER 2004

PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF A FULL YEAR OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON SPC DEBT

ASSUMED IN THE MERGER ON APRIL 1, 2004. THE COMPANYS DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 DECLINED BY A NET $463 MILLION COMPARED WITH YEAR-END 2004. IN 2004, THE

$69 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE OVER 2003 REFLECTED THE INCREMENTAL

EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH SPC DEBT ASSUMED IN THE MERGER.

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON INCOME FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS 22.8%, 7.3% AND 24.1% IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. THE 2005 AND 2003 EFFECTIVE RATE REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF

PRETAX INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH PROFITABLE UNDERWRITING PERFORMANCE. THE LOW 2004

EFFECTIVE RATE PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN NONTAXABLE

INVESTMENT INCOME ON A LOWER LEVEL OF PRETAX INCOME.

GAAP COMBINED RATIOS

CATASTROPHE LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR 10.3 POINTS OF THE 2005 LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO, COMPARED WITH 4.0 POINTS IN 2004. THE LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2005 INCLUDED A 1.6 POINT IMPACT OF NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, WHEREAS THE 2004 RATIO INCLUDED A 12.6 POINT

IMPACT OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE 2005 LOSS AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO ALSO REFLECTED AN IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT ACCIDENT

YEAR NON-CATASTROPHE LOSS EXPERIENCE, COMPARED WITH 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

REDUCED CLAIM ACTIVITY. THE 1.1 POINT INCREASE IN THE 2005 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE

RATIO COMPARED WITH 2004 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS, STATE

ASSESSMENTS, EARNED PREMIUM DECLINES IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, INCREASED

COMMISSION EXPENSES IN THE PERSONAL SEGMENT AND INVESTMENTS MADE FOR PROCESS

RE-ENGINEERING AND TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT,

PRIMARILY IN THE PERSONAL SEGMENT. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

EXPENSE EFFICIENCIES REALIZED SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2004

INCLUDED A 4.0 POINT IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHES AND A 12.6 POINT IMPACT FROM NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE RESPECTIVE IMPACTS OF THESE

FACTORS ON THE 2003 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO WERE 3.8 POINTS AND

2.8 POINTS. THE 2.7 POINT INCREASE IN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IN 2004

PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF HIGHER UNDERWRITING EXPENSES RELATED TO THE

BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, AS WELL AS EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

MERGER.

62

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

IN MARCH 2005, THE COMPANY AND NUVEEN INVESTMENTS JOINTLY

ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMPANY WOULD IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO DIVEST ITS 78% EQUITY

INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, WHICH CONSTITUTED THE COMPANYS ASSET

MANAGEMENT SEGMENT AND WAS ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE MERGER ON APRIL 1,

2004. THE DIVESTITURE WAS COMPLETED THROUGH A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS IN

THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2005, RESULTING IN NET PRETAX CASH PROCEEDS OF

$2.40 BILLION.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET OPERATING LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

OF $663 MILLION IN 2005, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF $710 MILLION OF TAX EXPENSE

DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS AND THE GAAP CARRYING VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE COMPANYS

SHARE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET INCOME PRIOR TO DIVESTITURE. THE COMPANY

RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF $345 MILLION ($224 MILLION AFTER-TAX) IN

2005. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF $88 MILLION IN 2004 REPRESENTED

THE COMPANYS SHARE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR.

THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO NUVEEN INVESTMENTS WERE REMOVED

FROM THE RESPECTIVE LINES OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND

REPORTED UNDER THE CAPTION NET ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED

TAX LIABILITIES GENERATED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANYS TAX BASIS AND

THE GAAP BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS PART OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.

RENEWAL RIGHTS PURCHASES

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, TPC PURCHASED FROM

ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE USA (RSA), AN UNAFFILIATED INSURER, THE RENEWAL

RIGHTS TO RSAS COMMERCIAL LINES NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, MIDDLE MARKET AND MARINE

BUSINESSES, AND STANDARD AND PREFERRED PERSONAL LINES BUSINESSES. ALSO DURING

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, TPC PURCHASED FROM ATLANTIC MUTUAL, AN UNAFFILIATED

INSURER, THE RENEWAL RIGHTS TO THE MAJORITY OF ATLANTIC MUTUALS COMMERCIAL

LINES INLAND MARINE AND OCEAN CARGO BUSINESSES WRITTEN BY ATLANTIC MUTUALS

MARINE DIVISION. THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE FOR THESE RENEWAL RIGHTS

TRANSACTIONS, WHICH WAS BASED IN PART ON THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS RENEWED BY

THE COMPANY, WAS $69 MILLION.

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME OF $756 MILLION IN 2005 WAS 4% LOWER THAN OPERATING

INCOME OF $786 MILLION IN 2004, AS THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE COST OF

CATASTROPHES IN 2005 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE COST OF

CATASTROPHES TOTALED $1.24 BILLION IN 2005, COMPARED WITH $363 MILLION IN 2004.

CATASTROPHES IN BOTH YEARS WERE THE RESULT OF THE HURRICANES DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT TOTALED

$694 MILLION IN 2005, COMPARED WITH $1.34 BILLION IN 2004. THE TOTALS IN BOTH

YEARS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHARGES TO INCREASE ASBESTOS RESERVES.

63

OPERATING INCOME OF $786 MILLION IN 2004 DECLINED

$275 MILLION, OR 26%, FROM 2003. THE DECLINE WAS DRIVEN BY NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $1.34 BILLION IN 2004, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE STRENGTHENING. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $676 MILLION IN 2003, PRIMARILY RELATED TO RESERVE

STRENGTHENING IN THE GULF OPERATION DUE TO A LINE OF BUSINESS THAT INSURED THE

RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASED VEHICLES. OPERATING INCOME IN 2004 ALSO INCLUDED $363

MILLION FOR THE COST OF CATASTROPHES, COMPARED WITH $103 MILLION IN 2003.

EARNED PREMIUMS

THE $242 MILLION DECLINE IN EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN RUNOFF OPERATIONS, WHERE BUSINESS IS

INTENTIONALLY BEING NON-RENEWED, AND A DECLINE IN ONGOING OPERATIONS DUE TO A

LOWER LEVEL OF WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN THE LAST HALF OF 2004 AND FIRST HALF

OF 2005. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. IN

ADDITION, THE REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN

REDUCED NET EARNED PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2005 BY $52 MILLION. IN 2004, EARNED

PREMIUM GROWTH OF $2.26 BILLION OVER 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER AND

ALSO REFLECTED THE EARNED PREMIUM EFFECT OF MODERATING RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES

OVER THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS IN THE COMPANYS ONGOING COMMERCIAL BUSINESS

LINES. IN ADDITION, INCREMENTAL PREMIUMS RESULTING FROM THE RENEWAL RIGHTS

TRANSACTIONS WITH ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE AND ATLANTIC MUTUAL IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2003 CONTRIBUTED TO PREMIUM GROWTH IN 2004.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

REFER TO THE NET INVESTMENT INCOME SECTION OF

THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCUSSION HEREIN FOR A DESCRIPTION OF

THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT INCOME

IN 2005 AND 2004.

FEE INCOME

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FEE

INCOME DUE TO ITS SERVICE BUSINESSES, WHICH INCLUDE CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION

SERVICES TO LARGE COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE TO SELF-INSURE A PORTION OF THEIR

INSURANCE RISKS, AND CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO WORKERS

COMPENSATION RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS, AUTOMOBILE ASSIGNED RISK PLANS AND TO

SELF-INSURANCE POOLS. THE $51 MILLION, OR 8%, DECLINE IN FEE INCOME IN 2005

COMPARED WITH 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION, INCLUDING THE

LOSS OF SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2004 AND IN EARLY 2005. THE

STRONG INCREASE IN 2004 FEE INCOME OVER 2003 REFLECTED HIGHER NEW BUSINESS

LEVELS, RESULTING, IN PART, FROM THE THIRD QUARTER 2003 RENEWAL RIGHTS

TRANSACTION WITH ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE, RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES AND MORE

WORKERS COMPENSATION BUSINESS BEING WRITTEN BY STATE RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS.

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2005 TOTALED

$7.45 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $7.52 BILLION IN 2004. INCLUDED IN THOSE TOTALS

WERE $1.17 BILLION AND $363 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES (NET

OF REINSURANCE). NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE

COMMERCIAL SEGMENT TOTALED $694 MILLION IN 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO CHARGES TO

INCREASE ASBESTOS RESERVES BY $830 MILLION AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $30

MILLION. THAT UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OTHER NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $166 MILLION, PRIMARILY IN THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL,

WORKERS COMPENSATION AND PROPERTY LINES OF BUSINESS. NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $1.34 BILLION IN 2004, WHICH INCLUDED A

$927 MILLION CHARGE TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES AND A $286 MILLION CHARGE

TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2004 WAS A $157 MILLION ADDITION TO THE

RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, $38 MILLION FROM THE

COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER AND OTHER NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN THE COMPANYS GULF

OPERATIONS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE IMPACT OF THESE RESERVE INCREASES IN 2004

WAS FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN CORE COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, WHICH

RESULTED FROM REDUCTIONS IN THE FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED LOSSES.

THE ASBESTOS CHARGE IN 2005 RESULTED, IN PART, FROM

HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE COSTS DUE TO INCREASED TRIAL ACTIVITY FOR

SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED PLAINTIFFS AND PROLONGED LITIGATION BEFORE CASES ARE SETTLED

OR DISMISSED. THE 2005 CHARGE ALSO CONSIDERED THE JANUARY 2006 COURT

DECISION VOIDING, ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS, THE PREVIOUSLY RENDERED FAVORABLE

ARBITRATION DECISION IN THE ONGOING ACANDS LITIGATION. THE ASBESTOS CHARGE

RECORDED IN 2004 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION COSTS AND

ACTIVITY SURROUNDING PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. WITH REGARD TO ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVE ADDITIONS, THE 2005 CHARGE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO DECLARATORY

JUDGMENT COSTS, WHEREAS THE SIGNIFICANT 2004 CHARGE WAS RELATED TO REVISED

ESTIMATES OF COSTS RELATED TO SETTLEMENT INITIATIVES. SEE THE ASBESTOS CLAIMS

AND LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION SECTIONS HEREIN FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE RESERVES.

IN 2003, NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR LOSS DEVELOPMENT

IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT TOTALED $676 MILLION, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT

OF WHICH WAS $521 MILLION OF RESERVE STRENGTHENING IN THE GULF OPERATIONS. THAT

RESERVE STRENGTHENING WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A LINE OF BUSINESS THAT INSURED

THE RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASED VEHICLES AND THAT HAD BEEN PLACED IN RUNOFF IN

LATE 2001, AND THE RESOLUTION OF A RESIDUAL VALUE CLAIM DISPUTE. IN ADDITION,

IN 2003 THE COMPANY STRENGTHENED PRIOR YEAR RESERVES FOR CERTAIN RUNOFF LINES

OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING ASSUMED REINSURANCE. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2003 TOTALED

$103 MILLION.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2005 TOTALED

$1.65 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 5% OVER THE 2004 TOTAL OF $1.58 BILLION, WHICH

PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE 2004 TOTAL INCLUDED

MERGER-RELATED CHARGES AND CHARGES TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCES FOR ESTIMATED

AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS RECEIVABLES. THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT HAS REALIZED

SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE SAVINGS SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER PRIMARILY

THROUGH THE ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATE FUNCTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COMBINED

OPERATION.

GAAP COMBINED RATIO

THE

LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2005 INCLUDED A 14.0 POINT IMPACT

FROM CATASTROPHE LOSSES, COMPARED WITH A 4.1 POINT IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHE

LOSSES IN 2004. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTED FOR

8.1 POINTS AND 15.3 POINTS, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE 2005 AND 2004 LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS. EXCLUDING THESE FACTORS FROM BOTH YEARS, THE

ADJUSTED 2005 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO WAS 0.9 POINTS LESS THAN

THE COMPARABLE 2004 ADJUSTED RATIO, REFLECTING THE IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT

ACCIDENT YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE COMPARED WITH 2004. THE ADJUSTED 2004 LOSS AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO WAS 1.1 POINTS BETTER THAN THE 2003 LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND

CATASTROPHES, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN NON-CATASTROPHE

WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES DURING THE YEAR.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IN 2005 WAS 1.7 POINTS HIGHER THAN 2004, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING THE SIGNIFICANT EARNED PREMIUM DECLINES DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, AND

THE 0.4 POINT NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE $52 MILLION IN REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS AND

$18 MILLION OF CATASTROPHE-RELATED STATE ASSESSMENTS. THESE FACTORS WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF MERGER-RELATED EXPENSE SAVINGS

THROUGHOUT THE SEGMENT AND PERSONNEL REDUCTIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL OTHER SECTOR.

THE 2004 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF MERGER-RELATED

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE

AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS. THE 2.9 POINT INCREASE IN THE UNDERWRITING

EXPENSE RATIO IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE

HIGHER UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF BUSINESS IN RUNOFF (SOME OF WHICH WAS

ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER), THE MERGER-RELATED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND THE

INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS.

IN COMMERCIAL CORE OPERATIONS, GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED

6% AND 7% OVER 2004 TOTALS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. HOWEVER,

2005 WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN COMMERCIAL CORE OPERATIONS DECLINED WHEN

COMPARED WITH 2004 ON A PRO FORMA COMBINED BASIS, DUE TO INCREASING COMPETITION

IN THE MARKETPLACE AND PRICING LEVELS THAT WERE FLAT WITH 2004. BUSINESS

RETENTION LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE CORE COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, HOWEVER, INCREASED

OVER 2004, AND NEW BUSINESS LEVELS IMPROVED OVER 2004. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN

2005 FOR COMMERCIAL CORE OPERATIONS WERE REDUCED BY THE $52 MILLION OF

REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS RELATED TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN. IN COMMERCIAL OTHER OPERATIONS, GROSS AND NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS DECLINED 84% AND 82%, RESPECTIVELY, FROM THE COMPARABLE 2004

TOTALS, REFLECTING THE INTENTIONAL NON-RENEWAL OF BUSINESS IN THE RUNOFF

OPERATIONS COMPRISING THIS CATEGORY.

65

COMMERCIALS GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2004

INCREASED 23% AND 21%, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE 2003 TOTALS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN 2004 DECLINED WHEN COMPARED

WITH THE COMBINED NEW BUSINESS VOLUME OF SPC AND TPC IN 2003, REFLECTING THE

INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE AND THE IMPACT OF HIGHER PREMIUM FLOW IN

2003 ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTIONS.

IN THE COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS MARKET, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $4.39

BILLION GREW $176 MILLION, OR 4%, OVER 2004 VOLUME OF $4.21 BILLION, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. HOWEVER, 2005 WRITTEN PREMIUM DECLINED

FROM 2004 ON A PRO FORMA COMBINED BASIS. BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS IN THIS

MARKET IN 2005 INCREASED OVER 2004 AND WERE AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS FOR THE

YEAR. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME ALSO GREW OVER 2004. RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES IN 2005 IN

COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS DECLINED FROM 2004 AND WERE MODESTLY NEGATIVE FOR THE YEAR,

REFLECTING THE INCREASED COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS. COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS

NET PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2004 GREW $959 MILLION, OR 29%, OVER 2003 VOLUME OF $3.25

BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. RETENTION RATES IN 2004 WERE STRONG AND

RENEWAL PRICE CHANGE INCREASES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

NEW BUSINESS LEVELS WERE LOWER DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2004 AS THE BENEFIT

FROM THE ATLANTIC MUTUAL AND ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE RENEWAL RIGHTS

TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 DIMINISHED IN THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR.

IN THE SELECT ACCOUNTS MARKET, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS

IN 2005 GREW 7% OVER 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. HOWEVER,

2005 WRITTEN PREMIUM DECLINED FROM 2004 ON A PRO FORMA COMBINED BASIS. BUSINESS

RETENTION LEVELS IN 2005 INCREASED OVER 2004 AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED AND WERE

ALSO AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS FOR THE YEAR IN TOTAL. RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES

IN SELECT ACCOUNTS IN 2005 WERE IN THE LOW SINGLE DIGIT RANGE FOR THE YEAR,

WHICH WAS LOWER THAN RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES IN 2004. NEW BUSINESS LEVELS IN

SELECT ACCOUNTS DECLINED SLIGHTLY FROM 2004. SELECT ACCOUNTS 2004 PREMIUM

VOLUME OF $2.56 BILLION INCREASED $508 MILLION, OR 25%, OVER 2003, REFLECTING

THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. OVERALL RETENTION LEVELS WERE STRONG AND RENEWAL

PRICE INCREASES MODERATED TO THE MID SINGLE-DIGITS IN 2004. RETENTION AND

GROWTH IN 2004 REFLECTED THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN AGENCY

AUTOMATION, PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND SERVICE TO AGENTS IN THIS HIGH TRANSACTION

VOLUME BUSINESS.

IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 GREW 9% OVER 2004,

AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS GREW $190 MILLION, OR 18%, COMPARED WITH 2004, WHICH

REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER AND CHANGES IN DISCOVER RES REINSURANCE

PROGRAM. THE 25% INCREASE IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS NET PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2004 OVER

2003 REFLECTED NEW BUSINESS FROM THE THIRD-QUARTER 2003 ROYAL &

SUNALLIANCE RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION AND HIGHER BUSINESS VOLUMES IN RESIDUAL

MARKET POOLS, THE IMPACTS OF WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SHIFT TO

DEDUCTIBLE AND FEE-BASED PRODUCTS BY SOME OF THE COMPANYS CLIENTS. DURING

2005, RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS DISCOVER RE OPERATION WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM THE

SPECIALTY SEGMENT TO NATIONAL ACCOUNTS IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT. ALL PRIOR

PERIOD AMOUNTS WERE RECLASSIFIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE 2005 PRESENTATION.

IN COMMERCIAL OTHER, THE 82% AND 31% DECLINES IN

2005 AND 2004 NET PREMIUM VOLUME, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH THE RESPECTIVE

PRIOR YEARS REFLECTED THE INTENTIONAL NON-RENEWAL OF BUSINESS IN THE RUNOFF

OPERATIONS COMPRISING THIS CATEGORY (PRIMARILY GULF). CERTAIN BUSINESS

PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN BY GULF IS NOW BEING WRITTEN ELSEWHERE IN THE COMMERCIAL OR

SPECIALTY SEGMENTS. THE RUNOFF HEALTHCARE, REINSURANCE AND INTERNATIONAL

BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER PRODUCED MINIMAL WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2005

AND 2004. IN 2003, COMMERCIAL OTHER CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF RESULTS FROM THE

GULF OPERATION, WHICH MARKETED PRODUCTS TO NATIONAL, MID-SIZED AND SMALL CUSTOMERS

AND DISTRIBUTED THEM THROUGH BOTH WHOLESALE BROKERS AND RETAIL AGENTS AND

BROKERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON MANAGEMENT AND

PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY COVERAGES AND EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES OF INSURANCE.

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME OF $679 MILLION IN 2005 IMPROVED BY $1.33 BILLION OVER

THE OPERATING LOSS OF $648 MILLION IN 2004. THE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN 2005

OPERATING INCOME REFLECTED THE ABSENCE OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS STRONG NET INVESTMENT INCOME, IMPROVED CURRENT ACCIDENT

YEAR RESULTS IN SEVERAL DOMESTIC BUSINESSES (PARTICULARLY BOND) AND LOWER

COMMISSION EXPENSES IN CERTAIN BUSINESS UNITS. OPERATING RESULTS IN 2005 INCLUDED

A COST OF CATASTROPHES OF $356 MILLION (NET OF REINSURANCE AND INCLUDING

REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS), COMPARED WITH $220 MILLION OF SUCH COSTS IN 2004. THE

OPERATING LOSS OF $648 MILLION IN 2004 WAS DRIVEN BY NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $1.43 BILLION, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT CHARGES RELATED TO

THE CONSTRUCTION AND SURETY RESERVES ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, AS WELL AS OTHER

RESERVING ACTIONS THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN THE NARRATIVE THAT FOLLOWS. OPERATING

RESULTS IN 2004 ALSO INCLUDED $220 MILLION FOR THE COST OF CATASTROPHES

RESULTING FROM THE FOUR HURRICANES DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, WHEREAS 2003 RESULTS

INCLUDED NO CATASTROPHE LOSSES.

EARNED PREMIUMS

EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2005 INCREASED $1.10 BILLION, OR

24%, OVER 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. EARNED PREMIUMS

IN 2005 WERE REDUCED BY THE $48 MILLION IN REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS RELATED TO

THE HURRICANE LOSSES DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN.

EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2005 ALSO REFLECTED THE INCLUSION OF ONE ADDITIONAL MONTH OF

PREMIUM VOLUME TOTALING $37 MILLION TO ELIMINATE A REPORTING LAG AT THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, THE IMPACT OF WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SALE OF

CERTAIN CLASSES OF PERSONAL INSURANCE BUSINESS AT THOSE LLOYDS OPERATIONS. EARNED

PREMIUMS IN 2004 WERE REDUCED BY $76 MILLION OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS

PRIMARILY RELATED TO A RESERVE CHARGE IN THE COMPANYS BOND OPERATION. EARNED

PREMIUMS OF $4.64 BILLION IN 2004 GREW $3.47 BILLION OVER 2003, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

REFER TO THE NET INVESTMENT INCOME SECTION OF

THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCUSSION HEREIN FOR A DESCRIPTION OF

THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT INCOME

IN 2005 AND 2004.

67

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2005

INCLUDED $308 MILLION OF CURRENT YEAR CATASTROPHE LOSSES, COMPARED WITH

CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $209 MILLION RECORDED IN 2004. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN BOTH

PERIODS WERE DRIVEN BY THE HURRICANES DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN.

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 TOTALED $9 MILLION, AS

FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY

UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO 2004 HURRICANE LOSSES IN THE PERSONAL

CATASTROPHE RISK OPERATION. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT

TOTALED $1.43 BILLION IN 2004, WHICH INCLUDED CHARGES TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATE

OF THE ACQUIRED NET CONSTRUCTION RESERVES BY $500 MILLION AND THE ACQUIRED NET

SURETY RESERVES IN THE COMPANYS BOND OPERATION BY $300 MILLION, AS WELL AS A

$252 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF A CONSTRUCTION

CONTRACTOR. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE

NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR LOSS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THESE ITEMS IN 2004, AS

WELL AS OTHER RESERVING ACTIONS.

UPON HAVING ACCESS TO EACH COMPANYS DETAILED

POLICYHOLDER INFORMATION, INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, AND ACTUARIAL FILES ON

APRIL 1, 2004, IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER, THE COMPANY

WAS ABLE TO BEGIN THE DETAILED PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A UNIFORM AND

CONSISTENT APPROACH TO ESTIMATING THE COMBINED COMPANYS LOSS RESERVES. AS PART OF

THAT PROCESS, A TEAM OF ACTUARIES REPRESENTING THE HISTORICAL ACTUARIAL

PERSPECTIVES, JUDGMENTS AND METHODS APPLIED BY EACH LEGACY COMPANY, DISCUSSED

THEIR VIEWS, METHODOLOGIES, AND ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE DATA.

IN ADDITION TO THE DISCUSSION IN THE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

SECTION OF

THIS REPORT, OTHER ITEMS SPECIFICALLY CONSIDERED IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A

UNIFORM AND CONSISTENT APPROACH TO ESTIMATING THE COMBINED COMPANYS LOSS

RESERVES AFTER THE MERGER INCLUDED INTERPRETING THE ACTUARIAL AND CLAIM DATA IN

A UNIFORM MANNER AND DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF DATA SEGMENTATION

FOR ESTIMATION PURPOSES. THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF

JUDGMENT AND CAN, AND OFTEN DOES, LEAD TO RESERVE ESTIMATES THAT DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE OF PRIOR PERIODS, PARTICULARLY IN LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH

SEVERITY AND COMPLEX EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE RESERVING PROCESS ALSO

CONSIDERS THE EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE OUTCOMES, THE ACTUARIES INVOLVED HAD TO

ANALYZE THEIR DIFFERING VIEWS ON KEY ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS PREDICTING INFLATION,

ESTIMATING CLAIM DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS AND DETERMINING EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO

JUDICIAL RULINGS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AMONG OTHERS. THIS INFORMED JUDGMENT IS

BROUGHT INTO THE PROCESS BY INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS ACTUARIES, UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM

ADJUSTERS, AND COMPANY MANAGEMENT. ULTIMATELY, THIS PROCESS REQUIRED AN

ANALYSIS OF THE VARYING ACTUARIAL JUDGMENTS AND FORWARD-LOOKING ASSESSMENTS.

THE RESULT WAS SIMILAR TO A SINGLE, ONGOING INSURANCE ENTERPRISE OBTAINING MORE

INFORMATION IN A REPORTING PERIOD THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY AND IDENTIFYING A

CHANGE IN ESTIMATE IN ITS INSURANCE RESERVES IN THAT PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE

COMPANY RECORDED A $500 MILLION AND $300 MILLION CHARGE FOR CONSTRUCTION AND

SURETY, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004.

CONSTRUCTION RESERVES.

BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, UPON

THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER, PERSONNEL FROM THE PREDECESSOR COMPANIES WERE

ABLE TO SHARE DETAILED POLICYHOLDER INFORMATION, CLAIM FILES AND ACTUARIAL DATA

RELATED TO THE ACQUIRED CONSTRUCTION RESERVES. THIS ENABLED AN ANALYSIS TO BE

PERFORMED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE ACQUIRED CONSTRUCTION RESERVES USING TPCS

LONG-ESTABLISHED PRACTICES THAT INCLUDES EVALUATING EXPOSURES BY TYPE OF CLAIM

(E.G. CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, CONSTRUCTION WRAP-UP, OTHER), BY TYPE OF COVERAGE

(E.G. GUARANTEED COST, LOSS RESPONSIVE, OTHER) AND BY DETAILED LINE OF BUSINESS

(GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL AUTO, ETC.), AMONG OTHERS. FOR GENERAL LIABILITY

EXPOSURES, WHICH INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT AND CONSTRUCTION WRAP-UP,

INTERPRETATION OF UNDERLYING TRENDS (BOTH PRESENT AND FUTURE) AND THE RELATED

RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS IS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL DUE TO THE LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH

SEVERITY AND COMPLEX NATURE OF THESE EXPOSURES. IN PARTICULAR, FOR CONSTRUCTION

DEFECT, THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO WHETHER COVERAGE

EXISTS, WHEN LOSSES OCCUR, THE SIZE OF EACH LOSS, EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE

INTERPRETIVE RULINGS CONCERNING CONTRACT PROVISIONS AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE

ASSERTION OF THESE CLAIMS WILL EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY. AS A RESULT, MATERIAL

VARIATIONS CAN AND DO OCCUR AMONG ACTUARIAL RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THESE TYPES

OF EXPOSURES. IN A MERGER, THESE DIFFERENCES ARE LIKELY TO BE EVEN MORE

PRONOUNCED. PRIOR TO A MERGER, EACH LEGACY COMPANY CONSISTENTLY APPLIES ITS

ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ACTUARIAL METHODS TO ESTIMATE RESERVES. DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THESE ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ACTUARIAL METHODS NEED TO BE

UNDERSTOOD AND RECONCILED, AND A UNIFORM APPROACH NEEDS TO BE ADOPTED FOR

THE MERGED ENTITY. IN THIS SITUATION, MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS CAN AND DO OCCUR FOR

RESERVES RELATED TO EXPOSURES HAVING A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY.

ANALYSIS OF THE ACQUIRED CONSTRUCTION RESERVES WAS

COMPLETED NEAR THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF

THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ACQUIRED NET

CONSTRUCTION RESERVES BY $500 MILLION, INCLUDING $400 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION

DEFECT AND $100 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION WRAP-UP CLAIMS, AND RECOGNIZED THIS

CHANGE IN ESTIMATE AS AN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGE IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THERE

WAS NO REINSURANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHARGE.

68

SURETY RESERVES.

PERSONNEL FROM THE PREDECESSOR COMPANIES WERE

ALSO ABLE TO SHARE DETAILED SPC POLICYHOLDER INFORMATION RELATED TO SURETY

RESERVES UPON COMPLETION OF THE MERGER. ACCESS TO THIS DETAILED INFORMATION

ENABLED THE COMPANY TO PERFORM A CLAIM-BY-CLAIM REVIEW OF RESERVES AND

CLAIMS HANDLING STRATEGIES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004 USING THE COMBINED

EXPERTISE OF CLAIMS ADJUSTERS FROM THE LEGACY COMPANIES. THIS TYPE OF REVIEW

INVOLVES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

WITHIN WHICH CLAIMS WILL BE SETTLED, ESTIMATES FOR DATES OF LOSS OCCURRENCE AND

EVALUATIONS OF IBNR EXPOSURES FOR EACH INSURED. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF THE

DETAILED INFORMATION OBTAINED CONCERNING CONTRACTORS WITH REPORTED CLAIMS, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERED WHETHER OR NOT LOSSES WERE INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED ON

ONE OR MORE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS FOR EACH CONTRACTOR EXAMINED.

ALSO ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE COMPANY COULD BEGIN

TO USE THIS DETAILED INFORMATION TO COMPARE SPCS ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND

ACTUARIAL METHODS THAT WERE UNDERLYING THE ACQUIRED RESERVES WITH ITS OWN

ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ACTUARIAL METHODS. SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES WERE

FOUND TO EXIST. SIMILARITIES INCLUDED, BUT WERE NOT LIMITED TO, RECOGNIZING

CLAIM RESERVES WHEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT CONTRACTORS AND COMMERCIAL SURETY

INSUREDS WERE IN DEFAULT AND THEREBY UNABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, ESTIMATING

INITIAL IBNR PROVISIONS, AND PERIODICALLY RE-EVALUATING, AT LEAST QUARTERLY,

THE ADEQUACY OF THE RESERVES ESTABLISHED BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIMS RECORDED AND

REVISED ESTIMATES OF IBNR. DIFFERENCES INCLUDED JUDGMENTS AND METHODS RELATED

TO DETERMINING IBNR DEVELOPMENT FACTORS AND EXPECTED SALVAGE, AMONG OTHERS.

THAT THESE DIFFERENCES EXIST IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR

SURETY RESERVE ESTIMATES. SURETY IS A LINE OF BUSINESS FOR WHICH THERE ARE LOW

FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY, VERY COMPLEX CLAIMS FOR CERTAIN EXPOSURES,

PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS AND COMMERCIAL

SURETY INSUREDS. DETERMINING THE DATE OF LOSS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRES A

HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, THE CLAIM RESERVE ESTIMATES EVEN FOR

REPORTED CLAIMS ARE ALSO HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL. THESE TWO FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS,

COMBINE TO MAKE IBNR RESERVE ESTIMATIONS FOR SURETY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. DUE TO

THIS HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY, THE INFORMED JUDGMENTS OF DIFFERENT ACTUARIES

COULD AND DO VARY MATERIALLY. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN A MERGER, THESE

DIFFERENCES ARE LIKELY TO BE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED.

THE CLAIM REVIEWS AND ACTUARIAL ANALYSES WERE BOTH

COMPLETED NEAR THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF

THESE REVIEWS AND ANALYSES, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ACQUIRED

SURETY RESERVES BY $300 MILLION, NET OF $170 MILLION OF REINSURANCE, AND

RECOGNIZED THIS CHANGE IN ESTIMATE AS AN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGE IN THE SECOND

QUARTER.

OTHER RESERVING ACTIONS

. PRIOR TO THE MERGER AND BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, SPC

DISCLOSED THAT A LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR FOR WHICH IT HAD WRITTEN SEVERAL

SURETY BONDS WAS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR THAT WAS PERFORMED IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, A RESTRUCTURING PLAN WAS ADOPTED BY THE CONSTRUCTION

CONTRACTOR, ITS BANKS, AND SPC, AMONG OTHERS, AS A MEANS TO MINIMIZE ESTIMATED

LOSSES. SPC MONITORED THE PROGRESS OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR TOWARD

MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN THROUGHOUT SUBSEQUENT

QUARTERS. SPC ALSO ESTIMATED AND DISCLOSED ITS ESTIMATED ULTIMATE NET LOSSES

RELATED TO THIS EXPOSURE, BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 AND UPDATED

EACH QUARTER THEREAFTER, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF ADVANCES MADE OR EXPECTED TO

BE MADE TO THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, APPLICABLE COLLATERAL, CO-SURETY

PARTICIPATIONS AND REINSURANCE. THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THESE PARTICULAR

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS, COUPLED WITH THE DETERIORATING CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR AND THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER IT WOULD

MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN, RESULTED IN A HIGH DEGREE OF

JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSSES.

A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS THAT BEGAN IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2004 WAS COMPLETED DURING THE LAST HALF OF THE SECOND QUARTER. BASED UPON

THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE CONTRACTOR WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

MEET THE TARGETS SET FORTH IN ITS BUSINESS AND RESTRUCTURING PLANS. THEREFORE,

THE COMPANY MOVED FROM SUPPORTING THE CONTRACTORS RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO

ADOPTING A WORKOUT PLAN AS A MEANS TO MINIMIZE ESTIMATED LOSSES. UNDER THE

WORKOUT PLAN, THE COMPANY WOULD NO LONGER PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SURETY BONDS FOR

NEW PROJECTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR. ALSO AS PART OF THE WORKOUT

PLAN, THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING AND ENGINEERING

PROCEDURES FOR EACH OPEN PROJECT, WHICH INCLUDED USING SPECIALISTS TO IMPLEMENT

ADDITIONAL FORECASTING, CASH MANAGEMENT, AND REPORTING PROCEDURES, ON BOTH A

PROJECT-BY-PROJECT AND CONSOLIDATED LEVEL. BASED UPON THIS SECOND QUARTER

CHANGE TO A WORKOUT PLAN AND THE DETAILED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS THAT WAS ABLE TO

BE PERFORMED, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE NET LOSS BY

$252 MILLION, INCLUDING $9 MILLION OF REINSURANCE. THIS ESTIMATE TOOK INTO

CONSIDERATION PAID AMOUNTS, NET RECEIVABLES, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, OVERHEAD

COSTS, ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPLACING

THE CONTRACTOR, RECEIVABLE DISCOUNTS, CURRENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS FROM OWNERS AND

SUBCONTRACTORS AGAINST THE CONTRACTOR, AND THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL, AMONG

OTHERS.

69

ALSO DURING THE LAST HALF OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2004, A PARTICIPATING CO-SURETY ON THIS EXPOSURE ANNOUNCED THAT INSURANCE

REGULATORS HAD APPROVED ITS SUBMITTED RUN-OFF PLAN. BASED UPON INDUSTRYS

KNOWLEDGE OF THE CO-SURETYS RUN-OFF PLAN AND THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF ITS

FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY TO COLLECT THE

FULL AMOUNT PROJECTED TO BE OWED BY THE CO-SURETY AND ESTABLISHED AN

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESERVES. IN

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE CO-SURETY

WHEREBY THE CO-SURETY MADE A PAYMENT TO THE COMPANY AND WAS RELEASED FROM

FURTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPECIFIC

CONSTRUCTION EXPOSURE. THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT, COUPLED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY

ESTABLISHED CO-SURETY RESERVES, APPROXIMATED THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE

CO-SURETYS SHARE OF THE BONDED LOSSES RELATED TO THIS EXPOSURE.

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2004 INCLUDED

$209 MILLION OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES, COMPARED WITH NO SUCH LOSSES IN 2003.

RESULTS IN 2004 ALSO REFLECTED INCREASED CURRENT YEAR LOSS RATIOS ON PORTIONS

OF THE BOND AND CONSTRUCTION BOOKS OF BUSINESS, AND $150 MILLION OF UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN TPCS CONSTRUCTION OPERATION PRIOR

TO THE MERGER.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2005 TOTALED

$893 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 15% OVER THE 2004 TOTAL OF $779 MILLION WHICH

PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE 2005 TOTAL INCLUDED THE

IMPACTS OF A DECLINE IN COMMISSION EXPENSES AND EXPENSE EFFICIENCIES REALIZED

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. IN 2004, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF $779

MILLION WERE  SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN

THE 2003 TOTAL OF $222 MILLION, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER.

OTHER ITEMS INCREASING 2004 CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

COMPARED TO 2003 INCLUDE $217 MILLION OF CHARGES TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCES FOR

ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, POLICYHOLDERS RECEIVABLES,

AND THE CO-SURETY ON A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR CLAIM DESCRIBED ABOVE.

GAAP COMBINED RATIO

THE

LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2005 INCLUDED A 5.8 POINT IMPACT FROM

CATASTROPHE LOSSES, WHEREAS THE COMPARABLE 2004 RATIO INCLUDED A 4.6 POINT

IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHE LOSSES. THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO FOR

2005 ALSO INCLUDED A 0.1 POINT BENEFIT FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT, WHEREAS THE COMPARABLE 2004 RATIO IMPACT FROM NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED 30.8 POINTS. EXCLUDING BOTH FACTORS IN

EACH YEAR, THE 2005 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IMPROVED OVER THE

2004 RATIO, REFLECTING THE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT YEAR LOSS

EXPERIENCE IN 2005. THE IMPACT OF PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND

CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2003 WAS NEGLIGIBLE.

THE 2005 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IMPROVED 1.7

POINTS COMPARED WITH 2004, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER AND EXPENSE

EFFICIENCIES REALIZED SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER. THE 2004 UNDERWRITING

EXPENSE RATIO WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY AN INCREASE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR

ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND MERGER-RELATED

RESTRUCTURING COSTS.

GROSS

AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 INCREASED 24% AND 20%, RESPECTIVELY, OVER

WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2004. THE INCREASE IN GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS

IN 2005 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN

2005 WERE REDUCED BY $48 MILLION OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS RELATED TO

CATASTROPHE LOSSES THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE CONSOLIDATED

OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN, WHEREAS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2004 WERE

REDUCED BY $76 MILLION OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS PRIMARILY RELATED TO RESERVING

ACTIONS IN THE BOND OPERATION. GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 WERE LEVEL, AND

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS WERE DOWN 2%, COMPARED WITH 2004 VOLUME ON A PRO FORMA

COMBINED BASIS. CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS WERE THE

SALE OF CERTAIN CREDIT-RELATED PERSONAL LINES CLASSES OF BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY

WRITTEN AT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, AND LOWER BUSINESS VOLUMES IN

CONSTRUCTION RELATED TO THE NOW-COMPLETED PROCESS OF ALIGNING THE UNDERWRITING

PROFILE OF THE TWO PREDECESSOR COMPANIES. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY PREMIUM GROWTH IN THE FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND SEVERAL OTHER

DOMESTIC SPECIALTY BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION, THE ELIMINATION OF A REPORTING LAG

AT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS RESULTED IN $35 MILLION AND $28 MILLION

OF ADDITIONAL GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2005, RESPECTIVELY. BOND

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 WERE LEVEL WITH THE 2004 PRO FORMA COMBINED

PREMIUM VOLUME (EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS IN 2004). IN

2005, APPROXIMATELY $114 MILLION OF GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN

IN THE COMPANYS GULF OPERATION IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT WERE WRITTEN IN

FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, COMPARED WITH $90 MILLION OF GROSS WRITTEN

PREMIUMS IN 2004.

IN DOMESTIC SPECIALTY OPERATIONS, AND INTERNATIONAL

SPECIALTY OPERATIONS EXCLUDING LLOYDS, BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS IN 2005 WERE

HIGHER THAN IN 2004. NEW BUSINESS LEVELS IN DOMESTIC SPECIALTY OPERATIONS WERE

ALSO HIGHER THAN IN 2004. IN INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY OPERATIONS EXCLUDING LLOYDS,

NEW BUSINESS LEVELS IN 2005 WERE LOWER THAN IN 2004. RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES IN

DOMESTIC SPECIALTY OPERATIONS, WHILE STILL POSITIVE, WERE DOWN FROM 2004.

AS DISCUSSED

PREVIOUSLY, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED CHANGES IN

THE TIMING AND STRUCTURE OF REINSURANCE PURCHASED IN THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT. THOSE

CHANGES RESULTED IN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CEDED PREMIUMS IN 2005 OVER WHAT WOULD

HAVE BEEN CEDED PRIOR TO THE CHANGES BEING IMPLEMENTED.

THE $3.51 BILLION INCREASE IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUM

VOLUME IN 2004 OVER 2003 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. HOWEVER, THE

REPOSITIONING OF THE BOND AND CONSTRUCTION BOOKS OF BUSINESS PRIMARILY

ACCOUNTED FOR A DECLINE IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2004 COMPARED WITH THE

2003 PRO FORMA COMBINED PREMIUM VOLUME OF SPC AND TPC. IN CONSTRUCTION, THAT

REPOSITIONING RESULTED IN REDUCED RETENTION LEVELS WHEN COMPARED WITH 2003, AND

NEW BUSINESS LEVELS ALSO DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY. IN BOND, THE REPOSITIONING OF

THE BOOK OF BUSINESS WAS PRIMARILY CENTERED IN THE SPC BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN THE

MERGER.

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2004 IN THE MAJORITY OF THE

COMPANYS REMAINING DOMESTIC SPECIALTY BUSINESSES WERE STRONG, WITH RETENTION

LEVELS AT OR ABOVE HISTORICAL LEVELS. RENEWAL PRICE CHANGE INCREASES IN THESE

OPERATIONS MODERATED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO THE UPPER SINGLE-DIGIT LEVEL. NEW

BUSINESS LEVELS IN 2004 WERE DOWN COMPARED WITH 2003, WHEN RENEWAL RIGHTS

TRANSACTIONS CONTRIBUTED TO STRONG GROWTH IN NEW BUSINESS. THE IMPACT OF THE

DECLINE IN NEW BUSINESS LEVELS IN 2004 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PREMIUM GROWTH

RESULTING FROM THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN BUSINESS FROM THE COMPANYS GULF

OPERATION, WHICH WAS PLACED IN RUNOFF IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE YEAR. IN

INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY, BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS IN 2004 (EXCLUDING LLOYDS)

WERE STRONG RELATIVE TO PRE-MERGER LEVELS, AND NEW BUSINESS LEVELS WERE

CONSISTENT WITH THE PRE-MERGER LEVELS IN 2003. IN 2004, THE COMPANY CONTINUED

ITS FOCUS ON RETAINING ITS PROFITABLE BOOK OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY

BUSINESS. AT LLOYDS, PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2004 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE

NON-RENEWAL OF CERTAIN CREDIT-RELATED PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE COVERAGES.

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME OF $775 MILLION IN 2005 WAS $164 MILLION LOWER THAN

OPERATING INCOME OF $939 MILLION IN 2004, LARGELY DUE TO THE $593 MILLION COST

OF CATASTROPHES PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA AND WILMA IN

2005, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN.

THE COST OF CATASTROPHES IN 2004 TOTALED $189 MILLION, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH

RESULTED FROM FOUR HURRICANES THAT STRUCK THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THE

PERSONAL SEGMENT IN 2005 BENEFITED FROM CONTINUED LOW NON-CATASTROPHE FREQUENCY

LEVELS, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $360 MILLION AND STRONG

NET INVESTMENT INCOME LEVELS. IN 2004, THE $447 MILLION INCREASE IN OPERATING

INCOME OVER 2003 WAS DRIVEN BY LOW NON-CATASTROPHE FREQUENCY LEVELS,

PARTICULARLY IN THE PROPERTY LINE, STRONG PREMIUM GROWTH RESULTING FROM UNIT

GROWTH AND PRICE INCREASES, AND $378 MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT IN 2003 TOTALED $212

MILLION.

EARNED PREMIUMS

EARNED

PREMIUMS OF $6.03 BILLION IN 2005 INCREASED $448 MILLION, OR 8%, OVER 2004

EARNED PREMIUMS OF $5.58 BILLION, REFLECTING CONTINUED STRONG BUSINESS

RETENTION LEVELS, NEW BUSINESS VOLUMES AND RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES OVER THE

PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS. EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2005 WERE REDUCED BY $21 MILLION OF

REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN.

THE $758 MILLION, OR 16%, GROWTH IN EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2004 OVER 2003 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ORGANIC NEW BUSINESS VOLUME, NEW BUSINESS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION

ENTERED INTO IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS AND

RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES OVER THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

REFER TO THE NET INVESTMENT INCOME SECTION OF

THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCUSSION HEREIN FOR A DESCRIPTION OF

THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT INCOME

IN 2005 AND 2004.

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2005 INCLUDED

CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $547 MILLION, COMPARED WITH CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $189

MILLION IN 2004. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN BOTH YEARS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE

HURRICANES DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN. NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 WAS $360 MILLION, COMPARED

WITH NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $378 MILLION IN 2004. THE

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 AND 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY

FURTHER DECLINES IN THE FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND LOWER THAN

EXPECTED SEVERITY RESULTING FROM RECENT CLAIM INITIATIVES. THE FAVORABLE

DEVELOPMENT IN BOTH YEARS ALSO REFLECTED THE RECOGNITION OF LOWER CURRENT

ACCIDENT YEAR FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED CLAIMS IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND

OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN FREQUENCY TRENDS IN THE AUTOMOBILE

LINE OF BUSINESS.

72

CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2004 OF $189 MILLION WERE $60

MILLION LESS THAN THE 2003 CATASTROPHE LOSS TOTAL OF $249 MILLION. THE 2003

LOSSES RESULTED FROM A VARIETY OF STORMS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING

HURRICANE ISABEL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE YEAR AND WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. FAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $378 MILLION IN 2004 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

THAN FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT OF $212 MILLION IN 2003. THE FAVORABLE

2003 DEVELOPMENT WAS ALSO PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER THAN EXPECTED FREQUENCY OF

NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED HOMEOWNERS LOSSES. THE 2003 TOTAL ALSO INCLUDED A $50

MILLION REDUCTION IN LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

TERRORIST ATTACK.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TOTALED $665

MILLION IN 2005, $536 MILLION IN 2004 AND $420 MILLION IN 2003. THE 2005 TOTAL

INCLUDED $25 MILLION OF CATASTROPHE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. THE INCREASES IN BOTH

2005 AND 2004 REFLECTED BUSINESS GROWTH AND AGENT PROFIT-SHARING EXPENSES

RELATED TO PROFITABLE UNDERWRITING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASES IN BOTH

YEARS REFLECTED INVESTMENTS IN PERSONNEL, TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO

SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH, AND CONTINUED PROCESS RE-ENGINEERING PILOTS TARGETED

TO REDUCE LOSS SEVERITY.

GAAP COMBINED RATIO

THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO FOR 2005

INCLUDED A 9.3 POINT IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHE LOSSES, WHEREAS THE COMPARABLE

2004 RATIO INCLUDED A 3.4 POINT IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHE LOSSES. THE IMPACT FROM

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 WAS 6.0 POINTS, COMPARED

WITH 6.8 POINTS IN 2004. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS IN BOTH YEARS,

THE 2005 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO WAS 2.8 POINTS BETTER THAN THE

2004 RATIO, REFLECTING IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR NON-CATASTROPHE

LOSS EXPERIENCE. THE 2003 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 69.1 INCLUDED

A 5.2 POINT IMPACT OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND A 4.4 POINT BENEFIT FROM NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. EXCLUDING THESE FACTORS FROM BOTH

2004 AND 2003, THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2004 IMPROVED

SIGNIFICANTLY OVER 2003, REFLECTING THE EARNED IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES THAT

CONTINUED TO EXCEED LOSS COST TRENDS AND IMPROVEMENT IN NON-CATASTROPHE LOSS

FREQUENCY.

THE 2.0 POINT INCREASE IN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE

RATIO IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN COMMISSION EXPENSES,

OTHER INSURANCE EXPENSES, AND TAXES, LICENSES AND FEES. THE INCREASE IN

COMMISSIONS REFLECTED A CHANGING PRODUCT MIX AND HIGHER AGENT PROFIT SHARING

EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN OTHER INSURANCE EXPENSES REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF

CONTINUED PROCESS RE-ENGINEERING INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN PERSONNEL,

TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS RELATED TO THE CATASTROPHE

LOSSES REDUCED EARNED PREMIUM VOLUME BY $21 MILLION IN 2005, AND

CATASTROPHE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS FROM VARIOUS INSURANCE POOLS INCREASED TAXES,

LICENSES AND FEES BY $25 MILLION.  THESE

FACTORS COMBINED TO RESULT IN A 0.5 POINT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE PERSONAL

SEGMENTS 2005 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO. IN 2004, THE 1.2 INCREASE IN THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OVER 2003 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE SAME

INVESTMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

IN 2005 WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER PRODUCT LINE, DRIVEN BY

CONTINUED RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES AND UNIT GROWTH. RETENTION LEVELS IN BOTH THE

AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS REMAINED STRONG, AND WERE

CONSISTENT WITH 2004. IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE, RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES IN 2005

REMAINED POSITIVE, BUT DECLINED WHEN COMPARED WITH 2004. HOWEVER, NEW BUSINESS

PREMIUMS IN 2005 IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE INCREASED OVER 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPANYS NEW MULTIVARIATE PRICING PRODUCT IN SELECTED

STATES. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 WERE REDUCED BY $21 MILLION OF CATASTROPHE-RELATED

REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN.

73

GROSS

AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2004 INCREASED 17% OVER 2003. BOTH AUTOMOBILE AND

HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED IN 2004 DUE TO HIGHER NEW

BUSINESS VOLUMES, THE IMPACT OF NEW BUSINESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROYAL &

SUNALLIANCE RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION ENTERED INTO IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2003, CONTINUED STRONG RETENTION, AND RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES.

THE

PERSONAL SEGMENT HAD APPROXIMATELY 6.6 MILLION AND 6.3 MILLION POLICIES IN

FORCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.  IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS, POLICIES

IN FORCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 INCREASED 4% OVER THE SAME DATE IN

2004.  POLICIES IN FORCE IN THE

HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 GREW BY 5% OVER

THE SAME DATE IN 2004.  EFFECTIVE IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER POLICIES IN FORCE INCLUDE CERTAIN

ENDORSEMENTS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY NOT BEEN COUNTED AS SEPARATE POLICIES.  PRIOR YEAR PERIODS WERE RESTATED TO CONFORM

TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

IN

THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS, POLICIES IN FORCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2004

INCREASED 9% OVER 2003. POLICIES IN FORCE IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINE OF

BUSINESS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 INCREASED BY 15% OVER 2003.

THE

INCREASE IN NET LOSS FOR INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER FOR 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEBT ASSUMED IN THE MERGER

AND A REDUCTION IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME, WHICH WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE

ABSENCE OF NON-RECURRING MERGER-RELATED CHARGES AND A REDUCTION IN NON-INTEREST

RELATED OTHER EXPENSES IN 2005.

THE

NET LOSS FOR INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2004 INCREASED $70 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2003, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT

OF THE MERGER. INCLUDED IN THE INCREASE WAS $46 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST

EXPENSE ON DEBT ASSUMED IN THE MERGER. THE 2004 TOTAL ALSO INCLUDED $9 MILLION

OF CHARGES RELATED TO THE MERGER THAT WERE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED

FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND INSURANCE

COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE INTENT OF INSURERS AND

POLICYHOLDERS.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS BEING TENDERED

TO THE COMPANY BY THE COMPANYS POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING

COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY), INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANYS POLICYHOLDERS

BY INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT APPEAR TO BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE.  FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS

INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS, THE FOCUS

BY PLAINTIFFS ON NEW AND PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS AND ENTITIES SEEKING

BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS A RESULT OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES.  IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL

NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF

ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES BY INITIALLY DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER

BY SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY.  BANKRUPTCY

PROCEEDINGS ARE ALSO CAUSING INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE

POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT THAT REMAIN IN THE TORT

SYSTEM.  RECENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS,

THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL

EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS,

WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION HAVE THEIR

HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET.  THIS TREND, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON NEW AND

PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE

PAYMENTS EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY.  IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE EXPERIENCE IS

IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER

INSURANCE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR

BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS.  THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS WHO HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, ACANDS, INC.,

WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR

ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE AS

DESCRIBED GENERALLY IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH. (ALSO SEE PART I  ITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS).  THESE TRENDS ARE

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN THE NEAR TERM.

AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF

UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE FROM ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

74

IN

SOME INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS CONTINUE TO ASSERT THAT THEIR CLAIMS FOR

ASBESTOS-RELATED INSURANCE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE AND

THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED AS A SEPARATE

OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE

POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES OR WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL IN ASSERTING ADDITIONAL DEFENSES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE

RESOLVED IN POLICYHOLDERS FAVOR AND OTHER ADDITIONAL COMPANY DEFENSES ARE NOT

SUCCESSFUL, THE COMPANYS COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE

WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE

LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE

POLICYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THE

CLAIMS FOR COVERAGE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS.

MANY

COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS

INVOLVING BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE

FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER

AMOUNTS THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. AS IN THE PAST, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE

TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN

ADDITION, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING

THE COMPANY, CHALLENGING INSURERS CONDUCT IN RESPECT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS, AND,

AS DISCUSSED BELOW, CLAIMS BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED

ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE FILING OF OTHER

DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, IN THE FUTURE. IT IS

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE

PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON

NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS

DEFENSES TO THESE CLAIMS AND HAS RECEIVED FAVORABLE RULINGS IN CERTAIN

JURISDICTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, TPC HAS ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, WHICH

HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE COURT IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY

TPC IN THE JOHNS MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY COURT. IF THE RULINGS OF THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT ARE AFFIRMED THROUGH THE APPELLATE PROCESS, THEN TPC WILL HAVE RESOLVED

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DIRECT ACTION PENDING CLAIMS AGAINST IT. (ALSO, SEE PART I

 ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS).

BECAUSE

EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY

GENERALLY REVIEWS THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER ON A

POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS. IN THE COURSE OF THIS REVIEW, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE

ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE

POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF EACH POLICYHOLDERS

POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE

CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT VALUES

OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER

INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS

CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR

DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN

ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE

LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM. WHEN AN ESTIMATE OF

THE GROSS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR INDEMNITY AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

IS DETERMINED FOR A POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY CALCULATES, BY EACH POLICY YEAR,

A CEDED REINSURANCE PROJECTION BASED ON ANY APPLICABLE FACULTATIVE AND TREATY

REINSURANCE, PAST CEDED EXPERIENCE AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS. CONVENTIONAL

ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES. THE COMPANYS

EVALUATIONS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN ANY DATA FROM WHICH A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE

ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY PAYMENT MAY BE DETERMINED.

THE

COMPANY ALSO COMPARES ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID

EXPERIENCE, YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR

CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. NET ASBESTOS LOSSES

AND EXPENSES PAID IN 2005 WERE $399 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $301 MILLION IN

2004. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCLUSION OF THE SPC BUSINESS FOR

THE FULL YEAR IN 2005 AND SUBSTANTIAL REINSURANCE RECOVERIES IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2004. APPROXIMATELY 42% IN 2005 AND 22% IN 2004 OF TOTAL NET PAID

LOSSES RELATE TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANYS LIABILITY. THE LOWER PERCENTAGE

EXPERIENCED IN 2004 REFLECTED SUBSTANTIAL REINSURANCE BILLINGS DURING THE

YEAR.  IN 2005, GROSS PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED

WITH POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS TOTALED $203 MILLION, COMPARED

WITH $199 MILLION IN 2004.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, NET ASBESTOS RESERVES TOTALED $4.36 BILLION, COMPARED

WITH $3.93 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE COMPANYS ANNUAL GROUND-UP

REVIEW OF ASBESTOS EXPOSURES RESULTED IN A RESERVE INCREASE OF $830 MILLION IN

2005.  IN 2004, THE COMPANY INCREASED

ASBESTOS RESERVES BY $922 MILLION FOLLOWING THE SAME GROUND-UP REVIEW PROCESS.

THOSE REVIEWS INCLUDED AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURES AND PAYMENT PATTERNS BY

POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. THE ASBESTOS CHARGE IN

2005 RESULTED, IN PART, FROM HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE COSTS DUE TO

INCREASED TRIAL ACTIVITY FOR SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED PLAINTIFFS AND PROLONGED

LITIGATION BEFORE CASES ARE SETTLED OR DISMISSED.  THE 2005 CHARGE ALSO CONSIDERED THE JANUARY 2006

COURT DECISION VOIDING, ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS, THE PREVIOUSLY RENDERED

FAVORABLE ARBITRATION DECISION IN THE ONGOING ACANDS LITIGATION. THE ASBESTOS

CHARGE RECORDED IN 2004 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION COSTS

AND ACTIVITY SURROUNDING PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS.

ACCOUNTS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON

LAW CLAIMS (FOR A FULLER DESCRIPTION OF THESE MATTERS, SEE ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS)

(COLLECTIVELY THE DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENT). RESERVES ARE BASED ON THE

EXPECTED PAYOUT FOR EACH POLICYHOLDER UNDER THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENT.

STRUCTURED AGREEMENTS ARE ARRANGEMENTS UNDER WHICH POLICYHOLDERS AND/OR

PLAINTIFFS AGREE TO FIXED FINANCIAL AMOUNTS TO BE PAID AT SCHEDULED TIMES.

STRUCTURED AGREEMENTS INCLUDE THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PPG

INDUSTRIES, INC. (PPG). IN MAY 2002 THE COMPANY AGREED ALONG WITH

APPROXIMATELY THREE DOZEN OTHER INSURERS AND PPG ON KEY TERMS TO SETTLE ASBESTOS

RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO PPG. THIS

SETTLEMENT IS TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (THE PLAN)

PROPOSED AS PART OF THE PITTSBURGH CORNING (PC) BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. THERE

REMAIN A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES TO CONSUMMATION OF THE SETTLEMENT INCLUDING

THE FINAL EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS, COURT APPROVAL OF THE PC PLAN OVER PENDING

OBJECTIONS, APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AND POSSIBLE APPEALS. PURSUANT TO THE

AND CORNING) ARE TO RECEIVE THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY SECTION 524(G) OF

THE BANKRUPTCY CODE FROM CERTAIN ASBESTOS RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. A

RECENT RULING BY THE THIRD CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS IN THE

IN RE COMBUSTION ENGINEERING, INC.

(CE) MATTER MAY IMPACT THE SCOPE OF RELIEF THAT IS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO THE

DEBTOR AND OTHER PLAN PROPONENTS. AS A RESULT, THE PC BANKRUPTCY COURT HAS

SOUGHT ADDITIONAL BRIEFING ON THE IMPACT OF THE CE DECISION ON THE PROPOSED PC

PLAN. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHAT EFFECT THE CE DECISION MAY HAVE WITH

RESPECT TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS APPROVAL OF THE CURRENT PLAN.  A HEARING IS SCHEDULED TO BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 28,

2006 BEFORE THE BANKRUPTCY COURT.  IT IS

NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW OR WHEN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WILL RULE ON THE

OUTSTANDING OBJECTIONS OR HOW AN APPELLATE COURT MAY RULE IN THE EVENT OF

AN APPEAL. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANYS SINGLE PAYMENT CONTRIBUTION

PURSUANT TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $404 MILLION AFTER

REINSURANCE WILL BE MADE IN CALENDAR YEAR 2006. COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS

REPRESENT AGREEMENTS WITH MAJOR POLICYHOLDERS ON SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE

TO BE PROVIDED. PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL MAXIMUMS AND ARE

ONLY MADE WHEN VALID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED. WELLINGTON ACCOUNTS REFER TO THE 35

DEFENDANTS THAT ARE PARTIES TO A 1985 AGREEMENT SETTLING CERTAIN DISPUTES

CONCERNING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEIR ASBESTOS CLAIMS. MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF

THE WELLINGTON AGREEMENT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS

IN WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED ON SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE AND THE TERMS

UNDER WHICH THE COVERAGE CAN BE ACCESSED. AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, TPC HAS ENTERED INTO THE DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENT WHICH IS

STILL SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES. IF THOSE CONTINGENCIES ARE MET,

THEN TPC WILL PAY UP TO $502 MILLION, POSSIBLY IN CALENDAR YEAR 2006. ONE OF

THE CONTINGENCIES INCLUDES AFFIRMANCE BY ALL APPELLATE COURTS OF THE ORDERS

ENTERED BY THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT WITH RESPECT TO THE DIRECT ACTION

SETTLEMENT. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW OR WHEN THE APPELLATE COURTS WILL

RULE ON THE PENDING APPEALS.

HOME

OFFICE, FIELD OFFICE AND OTHER RELATES TO POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN REACHED, AND ALSO INCLUDES UNALLOCATED IBNR.  POLICYHOLDERS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR HOME OFFICE

REVIEW BASED UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: AGGREGATE ULTIMATE EXPECTED PAYMENTS IN

EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED THRESHOLD (CURRENTLY $100,000), PERCEIVED LEVEL OF

EXPOSURE, NUMBER OF REPORTED CLAIMS, PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATIONS AND

POTENTIAL NON-PRODUCT EXPOSURES, SIZE OF POLICYHOLDER AND GEOGRAPHIC

DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD BY THE POLICYHOLDER.  IN ADDITION TO INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED

(IBNR) AMOUNTS CONTAINED IN THE RESERVES FOR HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE

POLICYHOLDERS, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A RESERVE FOR FURTHER ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS, NEW CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS

REPORTING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH THERE IS, OR

MAY BE, LITIGATION AND DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY.

ASSUMED

REINSURANCE EXPOSURE PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF REINSURANCE OF EXCESS COVERAGE, INCLUDING

VARIOUS POOL PARTICIPATIONS. THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE EXPOSED

TO U.S. ASBESTOS LIABILITIES THROUGH PARTICIPATIONS IN EXCESS INSURANCE

POLICIES, QUOTA SHARE AND EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE POLICIES, AND RETROCESSION

POLICIES, UNDERWRITTEN IN THE LONDON INSURANCE MARKET. DETAILS OF EXPOSURES

UNDER THE REINSURANCE AND RETROCESSION POLICIES ARE IDENTIFIED ONLY WHEN THE

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE

LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC

SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS

REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE

COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA),

ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL

AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND THREATENED

RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF

RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO

UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND

SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

77

THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING

INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS HAVE INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO

BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE

DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY THE COMPANY

PRIOR TO THE MID-1970S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY

FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY

INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT BY THE CLAIMANT FROM THE

POLICYHOLDER, AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING

SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE

(APPROXIMATELY $318 MILLION) IS CARRIED IN A BULK RESERVE AND INCLUDES

UNRESOLVED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS AS WELL AS FOR THE ANTICIPATED COST OF COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTES

RELATING TO THESE CLAIMS. THE BULK RESERVE THE COMPANY CARRIES IS ESTABLISHED

AND ADJUSTED BASED UPON THE AGGREGATE VOLUME OF IN-PROCESS ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

AND THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THOSE CLAIMS. THE BALANCE,

APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $107

MILLION), CONSISTS OF CASE RESERVES.

THE

RESOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES BY THE COMPANY GENERALLY OCCURS BY

SETTLEMENT ON A POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS AS OPPOSED TO A

CLAIM-BY-CLAIM BASIS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY STRIVES TO EXTINGUISH ANY

OBLIGATIONS IT MAY HAVE UNDER ANY POLICY ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER FOR PAST,

PRESENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXTINGUISH ANY PENDING

COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTE WITH THE POLICYHOLDER. THIS FORM OF SETTLEMENT IS

COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A BUY-BACK OF POLICIES FOR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE AGREEMENTS HAVE ALSO EXTINGUISHED ANY

INSURANCE OBLIGATION WHICH THE COMPANY MAY HAVE FOR OTHER CLAIMS, INCLUDING BUT

NOT LIMITED TO ASBESTOS AND OTHER CUMULATIVE INJURY CLAIMS. THE COMPANY AND ITS

POLICYHOLDERS MAY ALSO AGREE TO SETTLEMENTS WHICH EXTINGUISH ANY FUTURE

LIABILITY ARISING FROM KNOWN SPECIFIED SITES OR CLAIMS. PROVISIONS OF THESE

AGREEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE APPROPRIATE INDEMNITIES AND HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS TO

PROTECT THE COMPANY. THE COMPANYS GENERAL PURPOSE IN EXECUTING THESE

AGREEMENTS IS TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE AND

ELIMINATE THE RISKS PRESENTED BY COVERAGE LITIGATION WITH THE POLICYHOLDER AND

RELATED COSTS.

IN

ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE

PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY.

IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY,

AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF

SIMILAR EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED,

SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE;

THE ALLEGATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE

TOTAL NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF

ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF

GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE

OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS

INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER

INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF

YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL

NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN

EACH JURISDICTION. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE

THESE RESERVES.

IN

ITS REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS: THE ADEQUACY OF

RESERVES FOR PAST SETTLEMENTS; CHANGING JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE TRENDS; THE

POTENTIAL FOR POLICYHOLDERS WITH SMALLER EXPOSURES TO BE NAMED IN NEW CLEAN-UP

ACTION FOR BOTH ON- AND OFF-SITE WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES; THE POTENTIAL FOR

ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT AND ADDITIONAL NEW CLAIMS BEYOND PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS; AND

THE POTENTIAL HIGHER COSTS FOR NEW SETTLEMENTS. BASED ON THESE TRENDS,

DEVELOPMENTS AND MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS IBNR RESERVES

ACCORDINGLY. IN 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $290 MILLION, NET

OF REINSURANCE, TO INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES DUE TO REVISED ESTIMATES OF

COSTS RELATED TO RECENT SETTLEMENT INITIATIVES. IN 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

PRETAX CHARGE OF $30 MILLION, NET OF REINSURANCE, PRIMARILY FOR DECLARATORY

JUDGMENT COSTS.

THE

DURATION OF THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE

EXTENT OF TIME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE ESTIMATE, IF ANY, OF THE

VALUE OF THE CLAIM TO THE COMPANY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND ARE DEPENDENT UPON A

NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE

COOPERATION OF THE POLICYHOLDER IN PROVIDING CLAIM INFORMATION, THE PACE OF

UNDERLYING LITIGATION OR CLAIM PROCESSES, THE PACE OF COVERAGE LITIGATION

BETWEEN THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE

POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY TO NEGOTIATE, IF APPROPRIATE, A RESOLUTION OF ANY

DISPUTE PERTAINING TO THESE CLAIMS. BECAUSE THESE FACTORS VARY FROM

CLAIM-TO-CLAIM AND POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY CANNOT PROVIDE A

MEANINGFUL AVERAGE OF THE DURATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM. HOWEVER, BASED

UPON THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THESE CLAIMS, THE DURATION MAY VARY

FROM MONTHS TO SEVERAL YEARS.

78

THE

COMPANYS REVIEW OF POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME HAS

INDICATED THAT THEY ARE LOWER IN SEVERITY. THESE POLICYHOLDERS GENERALLY

PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE LOWER TIER DEFENDANTS.

FURTHER, REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE UTILIZING RISK-BASED ANALYSIS AND MORE

EFFICIENT CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED AN

INCREASE IN THE ANTICIPATED SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN MATTERS AS WELL AS AN

INCREASE IN LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. THERE ALSO HAVE BEEN JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS THAT, IN SOME CASES, HAVE BEEN UNFAVORABLE TO THE INDUSTRY AND

THE COMPANY.

GROSS PAID LOSSES WERE $248 MILLION AND $200 MILLION

IN 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.  THE

INCREASE IN PAYMENTS OVER 2004 WAS DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF THE SPC BUSINESS FOR

THE ENTIRE PERIOD IN 2005 AND A SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT WITH ONE POLICYHOLDER IN

2005.  TPC EXECUTED AN AGREEMENT WITH

THIS POLICYHOLDER WHICH RESOLVED ALL PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE HAZARDOUS WASTE

AND POLLUTION PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, AND ALL RELATED PAST AND PENDING BODILY

INJURY CLAIMS.  IN ADDITION, TPC AND THIS

POLICYHOLDER ENTERED INTO A COVERAGE-IN-PLACE AGREEMENT WHICH ADDRESSED THE

HANDLING AND RESOLUTION OF ALL FUTURE HAZARDOUS WASTE AND POLLUTION BODILY

INJURY CLAIMS.  UNDER THE COVERAGE-IN-PLACE

AGREEMENT, TPC HAS NO DEFENSE OBLIGATION, AND THERE IS AN OVERALL CAP WITH

RESPECT TO ANY INDEMNITY OBLIGATION THAT MIGHT BE OWED.  THE FIRST TWO OF THREE PAYMENTS RELATED TO

THIS SETTLEMENT WERE MADE DURING 2005, AND THE FINAL PAYMENT WILL BE MADE IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES

AS

A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE

ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT

LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX

LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS

ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR

DECREASE IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHICH CANNOT NOW BE ANTICIPATED,

THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE

RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF

AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER

INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER

AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

PERTAINING TO THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND

79

ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO

INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS

ALONG WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS ALSO NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR

IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS

DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS

WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION, INCLUDING LEGISLATION RELATED TO

ASBESTOS REFORM. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LARGE

COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS

ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY

WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES

AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS

OF ASBESTOS RESERVES, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANNUAL GROUND-UP REVIEW OF ASBESTOS

POLICYHOLDERS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ANNUAL GROUND-UP REVIEW DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005. ALSO SEE PART I  ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR

AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY

CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF

EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT

CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

THE

COMPANYS INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 TOTALED $68.29 BILLION, OF

WHICH 93% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, 1% IN

EQUITY SECURITIES, 1% IN MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE AND 5% IN OTHER

INVESTMENTS. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT ON INVESTED ASSETS OF SECURITIES LENDING,

UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, RECEIVABLES FOR INVESTMENT SALES AND

PAYABLES ON INVESTMENT PURCHASES, THE PRETAX AVERAGE YIELD WAS 4.7%, 4.8% AND

5.3% AND THE AFTER TAX AVERAGE YIELD WAS 3.7%, 3.7% AND 4.0% FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

BECAUSE

THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS TO FUND FUTURE CLAIMS

PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY. THE COMPANYS

FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 TOTALED $58.98 BILLION,

COMPRISING $58.71 BILLION OF PUBLICLY TRADED FIXED MATURITIES AND $274 MILLION

OF PRIVATE FIXED MATURITIES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE QUALITY RATINGS OF THE

COMPANYS PUBLICLY TRADED FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AND PRIVATE FIXED MATURITY

PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 WERE AA1 AND A3, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN

THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT THAT DATE WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.75 BILLION OF

BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES. DURING 2005, HOLDINGS OF TAX-EXEMPT

SECURITIES WERE INCREASED TO $31.46 BILLION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR

RELATIVELY HIGH CREDIT QUALITY AND ATTRACTIVE AFTER-TAX YIELDS. THE AVERAGE

EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, WAS 3.9 YEARS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 (4.3 YEARS EXCLUDING

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS), COMPARED WITH 4.1 YEARS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004

(4.4 YEARS EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS).

THE

COMPANY MAKES INVESTMENTS IN COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) THAT

TYPICALLY HAVE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY, OFFER GOOD LIQUIDITY, AND ARE EXPECTED TO

PROVIDE AN ADVANTAGE IN YIELD COMPARED TO U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO PURCHASE CMO TRANCHES WHICH OFFER THE MOST FAVORABLE

RETURN GIVEN THE RISKS INVOLVED. ONE SIGNIFICANT RISK EVALUATED IS PREPAYMENT

SENSITIVITY. WHILE PREPAYMENT RISK (EITHER SHORTENING OR LENGTHENING OF

DURATION) AND ITS EFFECT ON TOTAL RETURN CANNOT BE FULLY CONTROLLED,

PARTICULARLY WHEN INTEREST RATES MOVE DRAMATICALLY, THE INVESTMENT PROCESS

GENERALLY FAVORS SECURITIES THAT CONTROL THIS RISK WITHIN EXPECTED INTEREST

RATE RANGES. THE COMPANY DOES INVEST IN OTHER TYPES OF CMO TRANCHES IF A

CAREFUL ASSESSMENT INDICATES A FAVORABLE RISK/RETURN TRADEOFF. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT PURCHASE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN CMOS.

80

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, THE COMPANY HELD CMOS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE

FOR SALE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $3.43 BILLION AND $3.30 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY

(EXCLUDING COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES OF $1.16 BILLION AND $953

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY). APPROXIMATELY 43% AND 53% OF THE COMPANYS CMO HOLDINGS

ARE GUARANTEED BY OR FULLY COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES ISSUED BY GNMA, FNMA OR

FHLMC AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY HELD $4.83 BILLION AND $4.66 BILLION OF GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC OR FHA

MORTGAGE-BACKED PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE RATED AAA.

THE

COMPANYS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE WAREHOUSES AND OFFICE BUILDINGS AND

OTHER COMMERCIAL LAND AND PROPERTIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY OWNED.  THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY

COMPRISE VENTURE CAPITAL, THROUGH DIRECT OWNERSHIP AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS,

PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS

AND TRADING SECURITIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO MORE VOLATILITY THAN THE COMPANYS

FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, BUT HISTORICALLY HAVE PROVIDED A HIGHER RETURN. AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 AND 2004, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENTS WAS $3.03

BILLION AND $3.43 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS.



$11 MILLION IN THE FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO RELATED TO VARIOUS ISSUERS

DUE TO CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUERS DETERIORATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.



$80 MILLION IN THE VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO ON 22 HOLDINGS. TWO OF THE

HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO NEW FINANCINGS AT LESS THAN FAVORABLE RATES. FIFTEEN

HOLDINGS EXPERIENCED FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC DETERIORATION (CHARACTERIZED BY LESS

THAN EXPECTED REVENUES OR A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN PRODUCT). THREE OF THE

HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO THE IMPENDING SALE, LIQUIDATION OR SHUTDOWN OF

THE ENTITY. TWO OF THE HOLDINGS WERE PUBLIC SECURITIES WHOSE COST BASIS WAS NOT

ANTICIPATED TO BE RECOVERED OVER THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD. THE COMPANY

CONTINUALLY EVALUATES CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MARKET THAT HAVE THE

POTENTIAL TO AFFECT THE VALUATION OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS.



$18 MILLION IN ITS REAL ESTATE AND OTHER HOLDINGS. THE LOSSES RECORDED

WERE THE RESULT OF AN EQUITY PARTNERSHIP AND A PRIVATE STOCK HOLDING WHICH BOTH

EXPERIENCED FUNDAMENTAL DETERIORATION IN THEIR FINANCIAL POSITION.

FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THE FOLLOWING

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS.



$25 MILLION IN THE FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO RELATED TO VARIOUS ISSUERS

DUE TO CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUERS DETERIORATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.



$5 MILLION IN THE EQUITY PORTFOLIO WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE

COST BASIS OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD NOT BE RECOVERED OVER THE EXPECTED HOLDING

PERIOD.



$40 MILLION IN ITS VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO ON 16 HOLDINGS. THREE OF

THE HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO NEW FINANCINGS AT LESS THAN FAVORABLE RATES.

FIVE HOLDINGS EXPERIENCED FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC DETERIORATION (CHARACTERIZED BY

LESS THAN EXPECTED REVENUES OR A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN PRODUCT). EIGHT OF THE

HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO THE IMPENDING SALE, LIQUIDATION OR SHUTDOWN OF

THE ENTITY. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

MARKET THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT THE VALUATION OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENTS.



$10 MILLION IN ITS REAL ESTATE AND OTHER HOLDINGS. THE LOSSES RECORDED

WERE THE RESULT OF FALLING RENTAL RATES AND OCCUPANCIES IN THREE OF THE COMPANYS

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT HOLDINGS.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $65 MILLION IN THE FIXED

INCOME PORTFOLIO DURING 2003 RELATED TO VARIOUS ISSUERS, WITH $8 MILLION DUE TO

COMPANIES FILING BANKRUPTCY AND THE REMAINDER RELATED TO CREDIT RISK DUE TO THE

ISSUERS DETERIORATED FINANCIAL POSITION.

81

FOR

PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES, THE AMOUNTS OF THE IMPAIRMENTS WERE RECOGNIZED BY

WRITING DOWN THE INVESTMENTS TO QUOTED MARKET PRICES. FOR NON-PUBLICLY TRADED

SECURITIES, IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED BY WRITING DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, AS DETERMINED DURING THE COMPANYS QUARTERLY INTERNAL

REVIEW PROCESS.

THE

SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE IMPAIRMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE DID NOT

MATERIALLY IMPACT OTHER INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENTS HELD DURING 2005 OR 2004.

AN AMORTIZED COST OF $907 MILLION AND A FAIR VALUE OF $870 MILLION, RESULTING

IN A NET PRETAX UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSS OF $37 MILLION. THESE SECURITIES IN

AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION REPRESENTED LESS THAN 2% OF THE TOTAL AMORTIZED

PROFITABLE MARKET LEADER AND A COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDER OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES. A VARIETY OF FACTORS CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET AND THE COMPANYS CORE BUSINESS OUTLOOK

FOR 2006, INCLUDING INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE MAJORITY

OF MARKETS SERVED BY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, LOSS COST TRENDS

(INCLUDING MEDICAL INFLATION AND AUTO LOSS COSTS), ASBESTOS-RELATED

DEVELOPMENTS AND RISING REINSURANCE AND LITIGATION COSTS.

THE

COMPANY EXPECTS PROPERTY CASUALTY MARKET CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE

COMPETITIVE THROUGHOUT 2006.  RELATIVE TO

2005, WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY SEGMENTS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS RENEWAL

PRICE CHANGES TO INCREASE AND TERMS, CONDITIONS AND INSURED VALUES TO IMPROVE

FOR EXPOSURES SUSCEPTIBLE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, SUCH AS COASTAL PROPERTY AND

OIL AND GAS-RELATED EXPOSURES, WHILE RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES FOR NON-CATASTROPHE

EXPOSURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUBJECT TO MODEST DECLINES.  ALSO RELATIVE TO 2005, WITHIN THE PERSONAL

SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES IN THE AUTOMOBILE MARKET TO

REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE OR DECLINE MODESTLY, WHILE THE HOMEOWNERS MARKET IS

EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE.

82

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE TREND OF INCREASED SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY

OF STORMS EXPERIENCED IN 2005 AND 2004 WILL CONTINUE INTO 2006. GIVEN THE

INCREASED SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS, THE COMPANY IS REASSESSING ITS

DEFINITION OF AND EXPOSURE TO COASTAL RISKS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT, IF ANY, ON

ITS REINSURANCE PROGRAM.  ACCORDINGLY,

THE COMPANY IS REVIEWING ITS PRICING, EXPOSURES, RETURN THRESHOLDS AND TERMS

AND CONDITIONS IT OFFERS IN COASTAL AREAS. IN PART AS A RESULT OF THE SEVERITY

AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS IN 2005 AND 2004, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE COST OF

REINSURANCE TO INCREASE, AND THERE MAY BE REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE

COVERAGE.  TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY

IS NOT ABLE TO REFLECT THE POTENTIALLY INCREASED COSTS OF INCREASED SEVERITY

AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS OR REINSURANCE IN ITS PRICING, THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

IN PARTICULAR, IN THE PERSONAL SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS A DELAY IN

ITS ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICING TO OFFSET THESE POTENTIALLY INCREASED COSTS

SINCE THE COMPANY CANNOT INCREASE RATES TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY WITHOUT THE

APPROVAL OF THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN STATES.  ALSO, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE FREQUENCY

AND SEVERITY OF STORMS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, RATING AGENCIES MAY INCREASE

THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPANY.

WITH RESPECT TO NON-CATASTROPHE CLAIM FREQUENCY, THE INDUSTRY HAS

EXPERIENCED UNPRECEDENTED LOW LEVELS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, A TREND THAT THE

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO CHANGE MATERIALLY IN 2006.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS SEVERITY TREND, THE OTHER

COMPONENT OF LOSS TREND, TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN STABLE FOR NON-CATASTROPHE

CLAIMS. NEVERTHELESS, WITH CONTINUED PRESSURE ON PRICING, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

MARGINS WILL CONTRACT IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IN 2006.

CHANGES

IN THE GENERAL INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AFFECT THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW

INVESTMENTS. WHILE A RISING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT ENHANCES THE RETURNS

AVAILABLE ON NEW FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, IT REDUCES THE MARKET VALUE OF

EXISTING FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF GAINS ON

DISPOSITION. A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW

INVESTMENTS BUT INCREASES THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING INVESTMENTS AND THE

AVAILABILITY OF REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS ON DISPOSITION. IN 2005, SHORT-TERM

INTEREST RATES CONTINUED TO INCREASE, WHILE LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES REMAINED CONSISTENT

WITH 2004 LEVELS. CONSEQUENTLY, YIELDS AVAILABLE ON NEW INVESTMENTS BEGAN TO

GROW, BUT REMAINED BELOW THE EXISTING PORTFOLIOS AVERAGE BOOK YIELD. THE CONTINUATION

OF AN UPWARD TREND IN INTEREST RATES IN 2006 WOULD FAVORABLY IMPACT THE AVERAGE

BOOK YIELD OF THE COMPANYS FIXED INCOME HOLDINGS.

AS

REQUIRED BY VARIOUS STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO ASSESSMENTS FROM STATE-ADMINISTERED GUARANTY

ASSOCIATIONS, SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND SIMILAR ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE OPINION OF

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, THESE ASSESSMENTS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SOME

SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND LITIGATION ISSUES HAVE LED TO AN INCREASED

NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROPOSALS AIMED AT ADDRESSING THE COST AND

AVAILABILITY OF SOME TYPES OF INSURANCE AS WELL AS THE CLAIM AND COVERAGE

OBLIGATIONS OF INSURERS. WHILE MOST OF THESE PROVISIONS HAVE FAILED TO BECOME

LAW, THESE INITIATIVES MAY CONTINUE AS LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS CONSIDER

RESPONSES TO CONSUMER CONCERNS ABOUT AVAILABILITY, AFFORDABILITY AND CLAIMS

HANDLING AND COVERAGE, AND THE RESULTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IF ANY, COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO WRITE BUSINESS WITH APPROPRIATE

RETURNS.

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002

(THE TERRORISM ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW AND ESTABLISHED THE TERRORISM

RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM), A TEMPORARY FEDERAL PROGRAM IN THE

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THAT PROVIDED FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND

PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR

COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN INTEREST. THE PROGRAM WAS SCHEDULED TO

TERMINATE ON DECEMBER 31, 2005.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2005, THE

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005 (THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT)

WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW, REAUTHORIZING THE PROGRAM THROUGH DECEMBER 31,

2007, WHILE REDUCING THE FEDERAL ROLE UNDER THE PROGRAM. IN ORDER FOR A LOSS TO

BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN

AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS THAT VARY BY PROGRAM YEAR OF AMOUNTS $100

MILLION OR LESS, AND MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS AN ACT

OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.  THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM EXCLUDED FROM

PARTICIPATION CERTAIN OF THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE: FEDERAL CROP

INSURANCE, PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE, MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE INSURANCE, HEALTH OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD INSURANCE, AND

REINSURANCE.  THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT

EXEMPTED FROM COVERAGE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL TYPES OF INSURANCE, INCLUDING

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY (OTHER THAN DIRECTORS AND

OFFICERS), SURETY, BURGLARY AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS MULTI-PERIL.  IN

THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE

COVERED BY THE TERRORISM ACT AND THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT. BOTH ACTS

GENERALLY REQUIRE THAT ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN

THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A

PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

FOR A PERCENTAGE OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN

ANNUAL CAP.  THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT PERCENTAGE REMAINS AT 90% FOR 2006,

BUT DECREASES TO 85% IN 2007.  IN EACH CASE, THE DEDUCTIBLE IS CALCULATED

BY APPLYING THE DEDUCTIBLE PERCENTAGE TO THE INSURERS DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS

FOR COVERED LINES FROM THE CALENDAR YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE

YEAR. THE DEDUCTIBLE

83

UNDER THE PROGRAM WAS 7% FOR 2003, 10% FOR 2004 AND 15% FOR 2005, AND

WILL BE 17.5% FOR 2006 AND 20% FOR 2007.  THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED

DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS $1.91 BILLION FOR 2006.  THE ANNUAL CAP

LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO

$100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE $100 BILLION AGGREGATE

DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE U.S.

TREASURY AND AN INSURER THAT HAS MET ITS DEDUCTIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM YEAR IS NOT

LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES (OR PORTION THEREOF) THAT EXCEED THE $100 BILLION CAP.

THE COMPANY HAD NO TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES IN 2005, 2004 OR 2003.

WHILE THE TERRORISM ACTS PROVIDE A

FEDERALLY-FUNDED BACKSTOP FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS, THEY

ALSO REQUIRE THAT INSURERS OFFER COVERAGE FOR INSURED LOSSES CAUSED BY ACTS OF

TERRORISM. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY POLICIES

ALREADY INCLUDED SUCH COVERAGE, ALTHOUGH EXCLUSIONS WERE ADDED TO HIGHER-RISK

POLICYHOLDERS AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. FOR THOSE RISKS CONSIDERED

HIGHER-RISK, SUCH AS LANDMARK BUILDINGS OR HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF EMPLOYEES IN

ONE LOCATION, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EITHER DECLINE TO OFFER A RENEWAL OR

WILL OFFER COVERAGE FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY ACTS OF TERRORISM ON A LIMITED BASIS,

WITH AN EXPLICIT CHARGE FOR THE COVERAGE.

THERE

ARE CURRENTLY VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL PROPOSALS TO

REQUIRE ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS TO DEMONSTRATE AN ASBESTOS ILLNESS. AT THIS TIME IT

IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OR TIMING OF SUCH PROPOSALS BEING

ENACTED OR THE EFFECT IF THEY ARE ENACTED. THE COMPANYS ONGOING ANALYSIS OF

ITS ASBESTOS RESERVES DID NOT ASSUME THE ADOPTION OF ANY ASBESTOS REFORMS. FOR

INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTLOOK WITH RESPECT TO ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND

LIABILITIES SEE ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING

ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF A COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT

CASH FLOWS TO MEET THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS OF ITS BUSINESS

OPERATIONS.  THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS

OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED FROM

OPERATIONS, ASSET MATURITIES AND INCOME RECEIVED ON INVESTMENTS.  CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED

PRIMARILY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING

EXPENSES.  THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF

CATASTROPHE CLAIMS ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE.  SUCH CLAIMS, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH

HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA AND WILMA, INCREASE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.  THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE

RECOVERIES MAY BE AFFECTED BY REINSURER SOLVENCY AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE

DISPUTES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE VOLATILITY OF

ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIM PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS

ARISING OUT OF LITIGATION, MAY ALSO RESULT IN INCREASED LIQUIDITY

REQUIREMENTS.  IT IS THE OPINION

OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT THAT THE COMPANYS FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS WILL BE

ADEQUATELY MET FROM ALL OF THE ABOVE SOURCES.

NET

CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED

$3.59 BILLION, $5.07 BILLION AND $3.83 BILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY.  CASH FLOWS IN 2005

REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE CATASTROPHE LOSSES INCURRED DURING 2005 AND 2004, AND AN

INCREASE IN TAX PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM HIGHER PROFITABILITY.  CASH FLOWS IN 2004 INCLUDED $867 MILLION IN

CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED PURSUANT TO THE COMMUTATION OF SPECIFIC REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY. CASH FLOWS IN 2004 ALSO

BENEFITED FROM PREMIUM RATE AND VOLUME INCREASES. THE SIGNIFICANT RESERVE

ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER IN 2004 DID NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT

2004 CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY UTILIZED $2.00 BILLION AND $548 MILLION OF NET

OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS (NOL) DURING 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, THEREBY

REDUCING CURRENT REGULAR TAX PAYMENTS BY $698 MILLION AND $192 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.  NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2003 BENEFITED FROM PREMIUM RATE INCREASES AND THE

RECEIPT OF $361 MILLION FROM CITIGROUP, INC., A FORMER AFFILIATE, AND $531

MILLION OF FEDERAL INCOME TAXES REFUNDED FROM THE COMPANYS NET OPERATING LOSS

CARRYBACK.

NET

CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL THREE YEARS WERE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY PAYMENTS FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2005

AND 2004 WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS

RUNOFF OPERATIONS. INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS STRUCTURED AGREEMENT COMPONENT OF

ASBESTOS LOSS RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 WAS $404 MILLION (NET OF

REINSURANCE) FOR THE COMPANYS SINGLE PAYMENT CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT RELATED TO PPG, AND $502 MILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SETTLEMENT OF THE

STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS. ALTHOUGH EACH OF THESE

SETTLEMENTS IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES OR FINAL ORDERS AND RELIEF AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS WILL BE PAID

IN 2006.

NET

CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED $3.04

BILLION, $4.65 BILLION AND $2.48 BILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF INVESTMENT PURCHASES IN

ALL THREE YEARS. IN 2003, CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PARTLY OFFSET

BY SALES OF SECURITIES TO FUND NET PAYMENT ACTIVITY RELATED TO DEBT AND JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES HELD BY SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS OF $772 MILLION.

84

THE COMPANYS CASH FLOWS IN 2005 INCLUDED $2.40 BILLION OF PRETAX

PROCEEDS (AFTER UNDERWRITING FEES AND TRANSACTION COSTS) FROM THE DIVESTITURE

OF ITS EQUITY INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS.

OF THIS AMOUNT, $405 MILLION WAS RECEIVED DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANYS

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, AND THE REMAINDER WAS RECEIVED DIRECTLY BY THE HOLDING

COMPANY.  OF THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED

DIRECTLY BY THE HOLDING COMPANY, $1.225 BILLION WAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE CAPITAL

OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, WITH THE REMAINDER AVAILABLE FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  HOLDING

COMPANY LIQUIDITY LEVELS WERE INCREASED IN 2005 THROUGH DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM

THE COMPANYS OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, THE RETAINED PROCEEDS FROM THE NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS DIVESTITURE, THE THIRD QUARTER 2005 PROCEEDS OF $442 MILLION FROM

THE SETTLEMENT OF THE FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK

RELATED TO EQUITY UNITS ISSUED IN 2002 (DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW), AND

THE FOURTH QUARTER ISSUANCE OF $400 MILLION OF 5.50% SENIOR NOTES.  NET CASH FLOWS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE

NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2005 OR 2004.

THE MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY

DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID INTERMEDIATE-TERM TAXABLE U.S.

GOVERNMENT, CORPORATE AND MORTGAGE BACKED BONDS AND TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL

BONDS.  THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE

DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES

ARE EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT OF THE DURATION OF THE FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO GENERALLY PRODUCES A DURATION THAT EXCEEDS THE DURATION OF THE

COMPANYS NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES.  AS

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOCUSES ON ASSET AND LIABILITY DURATIONS, AND

NOT SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS, ASSET SALES MAY BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY OBLIGATIONS

AND/OR REBALANCE ASSET PORTFOLIOS.  THE

AVERAGE DURATION OF FIXED MATURITIES AND SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WAS 3.9 YEARS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, COMPARED WITH 4.1 YEARS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

THE

COMPANY ALSO INVESTS MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, VENTURE CAPITAL

AND REAL ESTATE. THESE INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS

BUT ALSO INVOLVE VARYING DEGREES OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN

AND LESS LIQUIDITY.

THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE COMPANYS ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS

ARE TO SATISFY THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES, MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK

EMBEDDED IN THOSE INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO

COVER FLUCTUATIONS IN PROJECTED LIABILITY CASH FLOWS.  GENERALLY, THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND

INTEREST PAYMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANYS FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO ADEQUATELY

FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE RESERVES.  ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EXACT CASH FLOW MATCH

IN EACH PERIOD, THE SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE BY WHICH THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED

INCOME PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES,

PLUS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF

HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS PROVIDES ASSURANCE OF THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FUND

THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS CREDIT

FACILITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, TOTAL CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTED ASSETS AND OTHER READILY MARKETABLE SECURITIES

AGGREGATING $1.57 BILLION WERE HELD AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL.  THESE ASSETS WERE PRIMARILY FUNDED BY

DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARIES, PROCEEDS FROM THE DIVESTITURE OF NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS, AND PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AND DEBT AS DESCRIBED

BELOW.  AS ALSO NOTED ABOVE, THE HOLDING

COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $1.225 BILLION OF THE NUVEEN INVESTMENT PROCEEDS TO THE

CAPITAL OF ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005.  THE ASSETS HELD AT THE HOLDING COMPANY,

COMBINED WITH OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS AVAILABLE, PRIMARILY ADDITIONAL DIVIDENDS

FROM OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, ARE CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE LIQUIDITY

REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY.  THESE

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND DEBT

SERVICE.

NET

CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED $473

MILLION, $516 MILLION AND $1.10 BILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY REPAID $815 MILLION OF ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT, PRIMARILY

COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING: MATURITIES OF $238 MILLION OF 7.875% SENIOR NOTES,

$79 MILLION OF 7.125% SENIOR NOTES, AND $99 MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

BEARING INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 6.44% TO 7.09%; AND A NET REPAYMENT OF

COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OF $395 MILLION.

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY ISSUED $400 MILLION OF 5.50% SENIOR

NOTES MATURING IN DECEMBER 2015.

THE MAJORITY OF PROCEEDS WAS USED TO FUND THE REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL

PAPER BORROWINGS, WITH THE REMAINDER USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

85

IN

JULY 2002, CONCURRENT WITH THE ISSUANCE OF 17.8 MILLION OF SPC COMMON

SHARES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING, SPC ISSUED 8.9 MILLION EQUITY UNITS, EACH HAVING A

STATED AMOUNT OF $50, FOR GROSS CONSIDERATION OF $442 MILLION.  EACH EQUITY UNIT INITIALLY CONSISTED OF A

FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACT FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK, WHICH MATURED IN AUGUST 2005,

AND AN UNSECURED $50 SENIOR NOTE OF THE COMPANY (MATURING IN 2007).  TOTAL ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE EQUITY

UNITS WERE AT THE RATE OF 9.00%, CONSISTING OF INTEREST ON THE NOTE AT A RATE

OF 5.25% AND FEE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FORWARD CONTRACT OF 3.75%.  HOLDERS OF THE EQUITY UNITS HAD THE

OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A REQUIRED REMARKETING OF THE SENIOR NOTE

COMPONENT.  THE INITIAL REMARKETING DATE

WAS MAY 11, 2005.  ON THAT DATE, THE

NOTES WERE SUCCESSFULLY REMARKETED, AND THE INTEREST RATE ON THE NOTES WAS

RESET TO 5.01%, FROM 5.25%, EFFECTIVE MAY 16, 2005.  THE REMARKETED NOTES MATURE ON AUGUST 16,

2007.  THE FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACT

REQUIRED THE INVESTOR TO PURCHASE, FOR $50, A VARIABLE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF AUGUST 16, 2005.  THE NUMBER OF SHARES PURCHASED WAS DETERMINED

BASED ON A FORMULA THAT CONSIDERED THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK ON EACH OF 20 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS ENDING ON THE THIRD TRADING

DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE SETTLEMENT DATE, IN RELATION TO THE $24.20 PER

SHARE PRICE OF COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING.  ON THE AUGUST 16, 2005 SETTLEMENT DATE,

THE COMPANY ISSUED 15.2 MILLION COMMON SHARES AND RECEIVED TOTAL PROCEEDS OF

$442 MILLION.

NET

MATURITIES AND RETIREMENTS OF DEBT, INCLUDING THE REPURCHASE OF COMMERCIAL

INSURANCE RESOURCES, INC.S (CIRI) OUTSTANDING NOTES, TOTALED $75 MILLION

IN 2004. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED THE MINORITY INTEREST IN CIRI

DURING 2004 FOR A TOTAL COST OF $76 MILLION. CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING

ACTIVITIES IN 2003 INCLUDED THE REDEMPTION OF $900 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT OF JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES HELD BY SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS, THE

REPAYMENT OF $700 MILLION OF NOTES PAYABLE TO A FORMER AFFILIATE AND THE

REPAYMENT OF $550 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT. FUNDS USED IN THESE REPAYMENTS

WERE PRIMARILY PROVIDED BY THE COMPANYS ISSUANCE OF $1.40 BILLION OF SENIOR

NOTES IN MARCH 2003 AND BY CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

THESE REFINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE INITIATED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF LOWERING THE

AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON THE COMPANYS TOTAL OUTSTANDING DEBT. ALSO REFLECTED IN

2003 WAS THE ISSUANCE OF $550 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM FLOATING RATE NOTES WHICH

WERE USED TO REPAY THE $550 MILLION PROMISSORY NOTE DUE IN JANUARY 2004.

DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS TOTALED $628 MILLION, $642 MILLION AND

$282 MILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS $636

MILLION OF COMMON DIVIDENDS IN 2004 WERE COMPRISED OF REGULAR QUARTERLY

DIVIDENDS TOTALING $522 MILLION AND $114 MILLION THAT HAD BEEN DECLARED BY SPC

PRIOR TO THE MERGER. THAT AMOUNT CONSISTED OF SPCS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND

AT A RATE OF $0.29 PER SHARE ($66 MILLION), AND A SPECIAL $0.21 PER SHARE ($48

MILLION) DIVIDEND RELATED TO THE MERGER. THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND DECLARED BY SPC

PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER WAS DESIGNED TO RESULT IN THE HOLDERS OF SPCS

COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO THE MERGER RECEIVING AGGREGATE DIVIDENDS WITH RECORD

DATES IN 2004 OF $1.16 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS SPCS INDICATED ANNUAL DIVIDEND

RATE PRIOR TO THE MERGER. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.23 PER SHARE, PAYABLE MARCH 31,

2006 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON MARCH 10, 2006.

THE

DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS TO HOLDERS OF THE COMPANYS COMMON

STOCK WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL

DEPEND UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION,

EARNINGS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, LEGAL

REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS DEEMS RELEVANT. DIVIDENDS WOULD BE PAID BY THE COMPANY ONLY IF

DECLARED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OUT OF FUNDS LEGALLY AVAILABLE, SUBJECT TO

ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY.

IN

2005 AND 2004, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 0.8 MILLION AND 0.4 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY,

OF COMMON STOCK FROM EMPLOYEES AS TREASURY STOCK PRIMARILY TO COVER PAYROLL

WITHHOLDING TAXES IN CONNECTION WITH THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND

EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS. IN 2003, TPC REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION

SHARES (AS ADJUSTED FOR THE MERGER) OF COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $40

MILLION, REPRESENTING THE ACQUISITION OF SHARES UNDER A REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT

HAD BEEN APPROVED BY TPCS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. TPCS REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS

TERMINATED UPON COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

UPON

COMPLETION OF THE MERGER ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL

OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SPCS OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF

$3.68 BILLION AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SPC DEBT ACQUIRED WAS ADJUSTED TO MARKET

VALUE AS OF APRIL 1, 2004 USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD, WHICH

RESULTED IN A $301 MILLION ADJUSTMENT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED DEBT OUTSTANDING. THAT FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT IS BEING AMORTIZED

OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ACQUIRED. THAT

AMORTIZATION, WHICH TOTALED $54 MILLION IN 2005 AND $55 MILLION IN 2004,

REDUCED REPORTED INTEREST EXPENSE.

THE

COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS ON ITS CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED NOTES FOR A PERIOD NOT EXCEEDING 20 CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY INTEREST

PERIODS. IF THE COMPANY ELECTS TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE NOTES, IT WILL

NOT BE PERMITTED, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK

DURING A DEFERRAL PERIOD.

IN

NOVEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY ISSUED $400 MILLION OF 5.50% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 1,

2015.  THE NOTES PAY INTEREST

SEMI-ANNUALLY ON JUNE 1 AND DECEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR, BEGINNING JUNE 1,

2006, ARE SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND RANK EQUALLY WITH ALL OF THE COMPANYS

OTHER SENIOR UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS. THE COMPANY MAY REDEEM SOME OR ALL OF THE

NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF: 100% OF

THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED; OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT

VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE

SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED (EXCLUSIVE OF INTEREST ACCRUED TO THE DATE OF

REDEMPTION) DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMIANNUAL BASIS AT THE

THEN CURRENT TREASURY RATE PLUS 20 BASIS POINTS.  THE MAJORITY OF THE PROCEEDS WAS USED TO PAY

DOWN THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING, WITH THE REMAINDER USED FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

87

ON

MARCH 11, 2003, TPC ISSUED $1.40 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES COMPRISING $400

MILLION OF 3.75% SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2008, $500 MILLION OF 5.00%

SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2013 AND $500 MILLION OF 6.375% SENIOR NOTES

DUE MARCH 15, 2033. THE NOTES PAY INTEREST SEMI-ANNUALLY ON MARCH 15

AND SEPTEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR, BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 15, 2003, ARE

SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND RANK EQUALLY WITH ALL OF TPCS OTHER SENIOR

UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS. TPC MAY REDEEM SOME OR ALL OF THE NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY

BY PAYING A MAKE-WHOLE PREMIUM BASED ON U.S. TREASURY RATES. THE NET PROCEEDS

FROM THE SALE OF THESE NOTES WERE CONTRIBUTED TO ITS PRIMARY SUBSIDIARY,

TRAVELERS INSURANCE GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. (TIGHI), SO THAT TIGHI COULD

PREPAY AND REFINANCE $500 MILLION OF 3.60% INDEBTEDNESS TO CITIGROUP AND REDEEM

$900 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF TIGHIS 8.00% TO 8.08% JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES HELD BY SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS. THESE TRUSTS, IN TURN,

USED THESE FUNDS TO REDEEM $900 MILLION OF PREFERRED CAPITAL SECURITIES ON APRIL 9,

2003.

THESE

SENIOR NOTES WERE SOLD TO QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS AS DEFINED UNDER RULE 144A

UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE SECURITIES ACT) AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES IN RELIANCE ON REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. ACCORDINGLY, THE

NOTES (THE RESTRICTED NOTES) WERE NOT REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR

ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND COULD NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT

PURSUANT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS. AS PART OF THIS OFFERING, TPC AGREED TO FILE A

REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT TO PERMIT THE EXCHANGE OF THE

NOTES FOR REGISTERED NOTES (THE EXCHANGE NOTES) HAVING TERMS IDENTICAL TO THOSE

OF THE SENIOR NOTES DESCRIBED ABOVE (EXCHANGE OFFER). ON APRIL 14, 2003,

TPC INITIATED THE EXCHANGE OFFER PURSUANT TO A FORM S-4 THAT WAS FILED

WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. ACCORDINGLY, EACH SERIES OF

EXCHANGE NOTES HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, AND THE TRANSFER

RESTRICTIONS AND REGISTRATION RIGHTS RELATING TO THE RESTRICTED NOTES DO NOT

APPLY TO THE EXCHANGE NOTES.

LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN $800 MILLION

COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM WITH BACK-UP LIQUIDITY CONSISTING OF A BANK CREDIT

AGREEMENT. IN JUNE 2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $1.0 BILLION,

FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS.  THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT

REPLACED AND CONSOLIDATED THE COMPANYS THREE PRIOR BANK CREDIT AGREEMENTS THAT HAD COLLECTIVELY PROVIDED THE COMPANY ACCESS

TO $1.0 BILLION OF BANK CREDIT LINES.

PURSUANT TO COVENANTS IN THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY MUST

MAINTAIN AN EXCESS OF CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OVER GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS OF NOT LESS THAN $10 BILLION AT ALL TIMES.  THE COMPANY MUST ALSO MAINTAIN A RATIO

OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT TO THE SUM OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT PLUS

CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OF NOT GREATER THAN 0.40 TO 1.00.  IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS

OTHER CUSTOMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF

DEFAULT, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO A CHANGE IN CONTROL.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY WAS IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND ALL OTHER COVENANTS RELATED TO ITS

RESPECTIVE DEBT INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING.

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS AN OPTION

TO INCREASE THE CREDIT AVAILABLE UNDER THE FACILITY, NO MORE THAN ONCE A YEAR,

UP TO A MAXIMUM FACILITY AMOUNT OF $1.5 BILLION, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF

A RATINGS REQUIREMENT AND CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS.  THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE

CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

SHELF

REGISTRATION

. IN DECEMBER 2005,

THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A SHELF

REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE POTENTIAL OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES.  THE COMPANY MAY OFFER THESE SECURITIES FROM

TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF

OFFERING.

ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED PAYMENTS

THE

TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE AMOUNT AND ESTIMATED FUTURE TIMING OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

RELATED PAYMENTS. THE AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE EXACT LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD

REPRESENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS TECHNIQUES, AT A

GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE

ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST BASED ON THE COMPANYS

ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL

SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY, FREQUENCY, LEGAL

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. VARIABLES IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION

PROCESS CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES

IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE

CHANGES. MANY OF THESE ITEMS ARE NOT DIRECTLY QUANTIFIABLE, PARTICULARLY ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS

BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND THE TIME IT IS ACTUALLY

REPORTED TO THE INSURER. THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE ITEMS CONTAINED

IN THE TABLE BELOW, REQUIRED ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT (INCLUDING SEVERITY

CONSIDERATIONS) AND TIMING. AMOUNT AND TIMING ARE FREQUENTLY ESTIMATED

SEPARATELY. AN ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS

RELATED TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY RELIABLE ONLY IN THE

AGGREGATE WITH SOME UNAVOIDABLE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

THE AMOUNTS IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN THE TABLE

ABOVE REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED TIMING OF FUTURE PAYMENTS FOR BOTH REPORTED AND

UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, NET OF

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THEREFORE, ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS INCLUDE CASH

INFLOWS RELATED TO REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR REINSURANCE

ACCOUNTING. A REINSURANCE AGREEMENT MUST INDEMNIFY THE INSURER FROM INSURANCE

RISK, I.E., THE AGREEMENT MUST TRANSFER AMOUNT AND TIMING RISK, IN ORDER TO

QUALIFY FOR REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING.

SINCE THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH INFLOWS FROM SUCH REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS ARE HIGHLY CORRELATED TO THE UNDERLYING PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES BY THE INSURER, THE ANALYSIS ABOVE PRESENTS THE ESTIMATED

CASH OUTFLOWS FOR REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND RELATED CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE, NET OF REINSURANCE. REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS THAT DO NOT

TRANSFER BOTH AMOUNT AND TIMING RISK ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS AND INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

FOR BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN BY NON-U.S. OPERATIONS, FUTURE CASH FLOWS

RELATED TO REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES WERE TRANSLATED AT THE SPOT RATE ON DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE TABLE ARE PRESENTED ON A NOMINAL BASIS AND

HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. ACCORDINGLY, THE

AMOUNTS ABOVE WILL DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET TO THE EXTENT THAT

THE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES HAS BEEN DISCOUNTED IN

THE BALANCE SHEET. (SEE NOTE 1 OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.)

(2)

WORKERS COMPENSATION LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES PROVIDE THIRD PARTY

COVERAGE IN WHICH THE COMPANY TYPICALLY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE ENTIRE

LOSS UNDER SUCH POLICIES AND THEN SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE INSURED FOR THE

DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. CLAIMS FROM LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES REPRESENT THE

ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENT FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED EXPENSES BELOW THE

DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, NET OF THE ESTIMATED RECOVERY OF THE DEDUCTIBLE. THE

LIABILITY AND THE RELATED DEDUCTIBLE RECEIVABLE FOR UNPAID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED

IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES AND CONTRACTHOLDER

RECEIVABLES, RESPECTIVELY. MOST DEDUCTIBLES FOR SUCH POLICIES ARE PAID

DIRECTLY FROM THE POLICYHOLDERS ESCROW WHICH IS PERIODICALLY REPLENISHED BY

THE POLICYHOLDER. THE PAYMENT OF THE LOSS AMOUNTS ABOVE THE DEDUCTIBLE ARE

REPORTED WITHIN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN THE ABOVE TABLE.

BECAUSE THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF THE DEDUCTIBLE (CONTRACTHOLDER

RECEIVABLES) OCCURS SHORTLY AFTER THE PAYMENT OF THE DEDUCTIBLE TO A CLAIMANT

(CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES), THESE CASH FLOWS OFFSET EACH OTHER IN THE TABLE.

THE AMOUNTS IN LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS RELATE TO ESTIMATED FUTURE

PAYMENTS OF SECOND-INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM PAYMENT OF

CURRENT CLAIM LIABILITIES. SECOND INJURY FUNDS COVER THE COST OF ANY ADDITIONAL

BENEFITS FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. FOR LOSS-BASED

ASSESSMENTS, THE COST IS SHARED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND SELF-INSUREDS,

FUNDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SELF-INSUREDS BASED ON

LOSSES. AMOUNTS RELATING TO SECOND-INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

(4)

THE AMOUNTS IN REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS

REPRESENT ESTIMATED FUTURE NOMINAL PAYMENTS FOR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS. AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER DEPOSIT AGREEMENTS ARE

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE AMOUNTS

REPORTED IN THE TABLE ARE PRESENTED ON A NOMINAL BASIS AND HAVE NOT BEEN

ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. ACCORDINGLY, THE AMOUNTS ABOVE

WILL DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET TO THE EXTENT THAT DEPOSIT VALUES

IN THE BALANCE SHEET HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED USING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTING.

(5)

THE AMOUNTS IN PAYOUTS FROM CEDED FUNDS

WITHHELD REPRESENT ESTIMATED PAYMENTS FOR LOSSES AND RETURN OF FUNDS HELD

RELATED TO CERTAIN REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS WHEREBY THE COMPANY HOLDS A PORTION

OF THE PREMIUM DUE TO THE REINSURER AND IS ALLOWED TO PAY CLAIMS FROM THE

AMOUNTS HELD.

THE

ABOVE TABLE DOES NOT INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF LIABILITIES REPORTED FOR STRUCTURED

SETTLEMENTS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS

CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY ISSUING THE ANNUITY.

THE COMPANY IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO INCUR FUTURE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER

SUCH AGREEMENTS. SEE NOTE 9 OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION.

DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

THE

COMPANYS PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN THE STATES OF

CONNECTICUT AND MINNESOTA. THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF BOTH STATES

APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRES NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY,

THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY

DIVIDEND, THAT TOGETHER WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING

TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURERS CAPITAL AND SURPLUS

AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURERS NET INCOME FOR THE

TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE

DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND BY STATE

REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED

UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES.

THE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANYS

SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME

INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE RESTRICTIVE, LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. A

MAXIMUM OF $2.56 BILLION IS AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2006 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS

WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT FOR

CONNECTICUT-DOMICILED SUBSIDIARIES AND THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE FOR

MINNESOTA-DOMICILED SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY RECEIVED $968 MILLION OF

DIVIDENDS FROM ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2005.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

THE

NAIC ADOPTED RBC REQUIREMENTS FOR PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES TO BE USED AS

MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THE NAIC AND STATES TO IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT

MERIT FURTHER REGULATORY ACTION. THE FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO

DIFFERENTIATE AMONG ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH LEVELS

OF CAPITAL HIGHER THAN RBC REQUIREMENTS. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND

INEFFECTIVE TO USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, ALL OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN

EXCESS OF AMOUNTS REQUIRING ANY COMPANY OR REGULATORY ACTION.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE

COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO CERTAIN CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS FOR GUARANTEES RELATED

TO AGENCY LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES, THIRD PARTY

LOANS RELATED TO VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND VARIOUS INDEMNIFICATIONS

RELATED TO THE SALE OF BUSINESS ENTITIES TO THIRD PARTIES. SEE NOTE 17 TO THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE

ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION,

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

91

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES TO BE THOSE APPLIED

TO CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND RELATED REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES, AND INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS.

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIM

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR

CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET

REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT

INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE

AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE LOSS RESERVE

ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

OF CLAIMS WILL COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON THE COMPANYS

ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL

SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY,

EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN

ESTABLISHING RESERVES, THE COMPANY ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED

RECOVERIES, REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION. THE RESERVES ARE REVIEWED

REGULARLY BY A QUALIFIED ACTUARY EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS

SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES,

ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE

IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO

DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY,

THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE

DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME

BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY

REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING

PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ARE

REPORTED AND SETTLED. THE COMPANY RIGOROUSLY ATTEMPTS TO CONSIDER ALL

SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME LOSS RESERVES ARE

ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT ENVIRONMENT, FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT ANTICIPATED

AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN CURRENTLY RESERVEDFAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE.

BECAUSE

ESTABLISHMENT OF LOSS RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING

ESTIMATES, CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES MAY CHANGE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS

ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THE

ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED.

THERE

ARE ALSO RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR

CATASTROPHES.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE

ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY

OF THE COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE

COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY

UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE

RESERVES.  COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS

WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING

ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE

DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COSTS;

AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY.  THE

TIMING OF A CATASTROPHES OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING

PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY IN ESTIMATING

RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD.  THE

ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS LOSS RESERVES ARE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION WHICH AGGREGATED $4.79 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2005. WHILE THE ONGOING STUDY OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES AND

OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO

COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN

COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES

REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS

FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. SEE THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION

OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

92

THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED SPCS RUNOFF HEALTH CARE RESERVES IN THE MERGER, WHICH ARE

INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE IN THE TABLE BELOW.  SPC DECIDED TO EXIT THIS MARKET AT THE END OF

2001 AND CEASED UNDERWRITING NEW BUSINESS AS QUICKLY AS REGULATORY

CONSIDERATIONS ALLOWED.  SPC HAD

EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON ITS HEALTH CARE LOSS

RESERVES BOTH PRIOR TO AND SINCE ITS DECISION TO EXIT THIS MARKET.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO UTILIZE SPECIFIC

TOOLS AND METRICS TO EXPLICITLY MONITOR AND VALIDATE ITS KEY ASSUMPTIONS

SUPPORTING ITS CONCLUSIONS WITH REGARD TO THESE RESERVES SINCE MANAGEMENT

BELIEVED THAT ITS TRADITIONAL STATISTICS AND RESERVING METHODS NEEDED TO BE

SUPPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MORE MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS.  THE TOOLS DEVELOPED TRACK THREE PRIMARY

INDICATORS WHICH INFLUENCE THOSE CONCLUSIONS AND INCLUDE: NEWLY REPORTED

CLAIMS; RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS; AND THE REDUNDANCY RATIO, WHICH

COMPARES THE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS TO THE RESERVE ESTABLISHED FOR THAT

INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.  THESE THREE INDICATORS

ARE RELATED SUCH THAT IF ONE DETERIORATES, IMPROVEMENT ON ANOTHER IS NECESSARY

FOR THE COMPANY TO CONCLUDE THAT FURTHER RESERVE STRENGTHENING IS NOT

NECESSARY.  THE COMPANYS CURRENT VIEW IS

THAT IT HAS RECORDED A REASONABLE RESERVE FOR ITS MEDICAL MALPRACTICE EXPOSURES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE $2.02 BILLION INCREASE IN PROPERTY-CASUALTY CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2004 REFLECTED THE IMPACT

OF THE SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE LOSSES INCURRED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2005 AND

THE $830 MILLION NET CHARGE TO INCREASE ASBESTOS RESERVES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2005.  THESE INCREASES IN RESERVES

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CLAIM AND CLAIM EXPENSE PAYMENTS FROM RUNOFF

OPERATIONS, LOSS PAYOUTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER 2004 HURRICANES, AND FAVORABLE

NON-CATASTROPHE LOSS EXPERIENCE.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004

INCREASED BY $24.51 BILLION OVER YEAR-END 2003, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE

MERGER WITH SPC AND RESERVE CHARGES RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER. OF THE

INCREASE IN 2004, $19.50 BILLION RESULTED FROM THE ADDITION OF THE ACQUIRED

RESERVES, AND $2.39 BILLION, NET OF REINSURANCE, WAS DUE TO NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT.  FOR

DISCUSSION OF THE COMPONENTS OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT,

SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ASBESTOS

AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL LINES AND INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER LINES IN THE SUMMARY TABLE.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE DISCUSSED SEPARATELY, SEE ASBESTOS

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

93

GENERAL DISCUSSION

THE

PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING THE LIABILITIES FOR CLAIM AND CLAIM EXPENSES BEGINS WITH

THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CLAIM DATA. DATA ON INDIVIDUAL REPORTED CLAIMS,

BOTH CURRENT AND HISTORICAL, INCLUDING PAID AMOUNTS AND INDIVIDUAL CLAIM

ADJUSTER ESTIMATES, ARE GROUPED BY COMMON CHARACTERISTICS (COMPONENTS) AND

EVALUATED BY ACTUARIES IN THEIR ANALYSES OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES BY

PRODUCT LINE. SUCH DATA IS OCCASIONALLY SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA AS

AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING RESERVES FOR A

COMPONENT IS UNDERTAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS, GENERALLY QUARTERLY, IN LIGHT OF

CONTINUALLY UPDATED INFORMATION.

MULTIPLE

ESTIMATION METHODS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF ULTIMATE CLAIM

LIABILITIES. EACH ESTIMATION METHOD HAS ITS OWN SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES AND

ITS OWN ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, WITH NO SINGLE ESTIMATION METHOD BEING

BETTER THAN THE OTHERS IN ALL SITUATIONS AND NO ONE SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES

BEING MEANINGFUL FOR ALL PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS. THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS AND

WEAKNESSES OF THE PARTICULAR ESTIMATION METHODS WHEN APPLIED TO A PARTICULAR

GROUP OF CLAIMS CAN ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME. THEREFORE, THE ACTUAL CHOICE OF

ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CAN CHANGE WITH EACH EVALUATION. THE ESTIMATION METHOD(S)

CHOSEN ARE THOSE THAT ARE BELIEVED TO PRODUCE THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATION AT

THAT PARTICULAR EVALUATION DATE FOR THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED.

IN

MOST CASES, MULTIPLE ESTIMATION METHODS WILL BE VALID FOR THE PARTICULAR FACTS

AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED. THIS WILL RESULT IN

A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES FOR ANY PARTICULAR CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY

USES SUCH RANGE ANALYSES TO BACK TEST WHETHER PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES

FOR RESERVES AT THE REPORTING SEGMENTS ARE REASONABLE, GIVEN SUBSEQUENT

INFORMATION. REPORTED VALUES FOUND TO BE CLOSER TO THE ENDPOINTS OF A RANGE OF

REASONABLE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER DETAILED REVIEWS. THESE REVIEWS MAY

SUBSTANTIATE THE VALIDITY OF MANAGEMENTS RECORDED ESTIMATE OR LEAD TO A CHANGE

IN THE REPORTED ESTIMATE.

THE

EXACT BOUNDARY POINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN QUANTITATIVE IN

NATURE, AS NO CLEAR LINE OF DEMARCATION EXISTS TO DETERMINE WHEN THE SET OF

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR AN ESTIMATION METHOD SWITCHES FROM BEING REASONABLE

TO UNREASONABLE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ENDPOINTS

OF THESE RANGES ARE OR WOULD BE COMPARABLE ACROSS COMPANIES. IN ADDITION,

POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT ESTIMATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT

PRODUCT LINES MAKE THE AGGREGATION OF INDIVIDUAL RANGES A HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL AND

INEXACT PROCESS.

PROPERTY

CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES ARE EITHER WRITTEN ON A CLAIMS MADE OR ON AN

OCCURRENCE BASIS. POLICIES WRITTEN ON A CLAIMS MADE BASIS REQUIRE THAT CLAIMS

BE REPORTED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD. POLICIES THAT ARE WRITTEN ON AN

OCCURRENCE BASIS REQUIRE THAT THE INSURED DEMONSTRATE THAT A LOSS OCCURRED IN

THE POLICY PERIOD, EVEN IF THE INSURED REPORTS THE LOSS MANY YEARS LATER.

MOST

GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. THESE POLICIES

ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT OVER TIME AS FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE POLICY ISSUANCE. THE USE OF THE

OCCURRENCE FORM ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, AND IT IS ALSO USED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR

CONSTRUCTION GENERAL LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. OCCURRENCE BASED

FORMS OF INSURANCE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL

PROJECTION OF VARIOUS TRENDS, INCLUDING FUTURE INFLATION AND JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS AND SOCIETAL LITIGATION DYNAMICS, AMONG OTHERS.

A

KEY ASSUMPTION IN MOST ACTUARIAL ANALYSES IS THAT PAST PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED IN

THE DATA WILL REPEAT THEMSELVES IN THE FUTURE, ABSENT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE

ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW. TO THE EXTENT A MATERIAL CHANGE

AFFECTING THE ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY IS KNOWN, SUCH CHANGE IS QUANTIFIED TO

THE EXTENT POSSIBLE THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL COMPANY AND, IF AVAILABLE

AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXTERNAL DATA. SUCH A MEASUREMENT IS SPECIFIC TO THE

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR CLAIM PORTFOLIO AND THE KNOWN CHANGE

BEING EVALUATED.  SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL

CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN MATERIALLY

IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS.

INFORMED

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE RESERVING PROCESS. THIS INCLUDES

THE APPLICATION, ON A CONSISTENT BASIS OVER TIME, OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL

EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. IN ADDITION TO

ACTUARIES, INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED WITH THE RESERVING PROCESS ALSO INCLUDE

UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PERSONNEL AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY MANAGEMENT.

THEREFORE, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE AND, GENERALLY, LIKELY THAT MANAGEMENT MUST

CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF LOSS

RESERVES. IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE, SUCH AS

A MERGER, CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF INFORMED JUDGMENT BECOMES EVEN MORE

COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT.

94

THE

VARIABLES DISCUSSED ABOVE IN THIS GENERAL DISCUSSION HAVE DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON

RESERVE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE

LENGTH OF THE CLAIM TAIL, THE REPORTING LAG, THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS

AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CLAIM PROCESS FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE.

PRODUCT

LINES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIABLE AS EITHER LONG TAIL OR SHORT TAIL, BASED ON

THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING CLAIMS UNDER A POLICY

AND THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THOSE CLAIMS. SHORT TAIL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND

SETTLED QUICKLY, RESULTING IN LESS ESTIMATION VARIABILITY. THE LONGER THE TIME

BEFORE FINAL CLAIM RESOLUTION, THE GREATER THE EXPOSURE TO ESTIMATION RISKS AND

HENCE THE GREATER THE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

A

MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE CLAIM TAIL IS THE REPORTING LAG. THE REPORTING LAG,

WHICH IS THE TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING A CLAIM AND THE REPORTING OF THE

CLAIM TO THE INSURER, MAKES ESTIMATING IBNR INHERENTLY MORE UNCERTAIN. IN

ADDITION, THE GREATER THE REPORTING LAG THE GREATER THE PROPORTION OF IBNR

CLAIMS TO THE TOTAL CLAIM LIABILITY FOR THE PRODUCT LINE. WRITING NEW PRODUCTS

WITH MATERIAL REPORTING LAGS CAN RESULT IN ADDING SEVERAL YEARS WORTH OF IBNR

CLAIM EXPOSURE BEFORE THE REPORTING LAG EXPOSURE BECOMES CLEARLY OBSERVABLE,

THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PRICING AND RESERVING SUCH

PRODUCTS. THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF CLAIM LIABILITIES WITH LONG REPORTING

LAGS ARE ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

FOR

SOME LINES, THE IMPACT OF LARGE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS CAN BE MATERIAL TO THE

ANALYSIS. THESE LINES ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS BEING LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH

SEVERITY, WHILE LINES WITHOUT THIS LARGE CLAIM SENSITIVITY ARE REFERRED TO AS

HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY. ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR LOW

FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY LINES CAN BE SENSITIVE TO A FEW KEY ASSUMPTIONS. AS A

RESULT, THE ROLE OF JUDGMENT IS MUCH GREATER FOR THESE RESERVE ESTIMATES. IN

CONTRAST, HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY LINES TEND TO HAVE MUCH GREATER SPREAD OF

ESTIMATION RISK, SUCH THAT THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS ARE RELATIVELY MINOR

AND THE RANGE OF REASONABLE RESERVE ESTIMATES IS NARROWER AND MORE STABLE.

CLAIM

COMPLEXITY CAN ALSO GREATLY AFFECT THE ESTIMATION PROCESS BY IMPACTING THE NUMBER

OF ASSUMPTIONS NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ESTIMATE, THE POTENTIAL STABILITY OF THE

UNDERLYING DATA AND CLAIM PROCESS AND THE ABILITY TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF

THE DATA. PRODUCT LINES WITH GREATER CLAIM COMPLEXITY, SUCH AS FOR CERTAIN

SURETY AND CONSTRUCTION EXPOSURES, HAVE INHERENTLY GREATER ESTIMATION

UNCERTAINTY.

ACTUARIES

HAVE TO EXERCISE A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT IN THE EVALUATION OF ALL

THESE FACTORS IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF RESERVES. THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN THE

APPLICATION OF ACTUARIAL JUDGMENT IS UNAVOIDABLE WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL

UNCERTAINTY. DIFFERENT EXPERTS WILL CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED

WITH SUCH UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL

EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF FOCUS. HENCE, THE ESTIMATE SELECTED BY THE VARIOUS

ACTUARIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EACH OTHER.

LASTLY,

SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR

ORGANIZATION CAN ALSO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS. THE

MERGER OF TPC AND SPC RESULTED IN THE EXPOSURE OF EACH OTHERS ACTUARIES AND

CLAIM DEPARTMENTS TO DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, DATA HISTORIES, ANALYSIS

METHODOLOGIES, CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPERTS, AND MORE ROBUST DATA WHEN VIEWED ON A

COMBINED BASIS. THIS IMPACTED THE RANGE OF ESTIMATES PRODUCED BY THE COMPANYS

ACTUARIES, AS THEY REACTED TO NEW DATA, APPROACHES, AND SOURCES OF EXPERTISE TO

DRAW UPON. IT ALSO RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY, AS PAST TRENDS

(THAT WERE A FUNCTION OF PAST PRODUCTS, PAST CLAIM HANDLING PROCEDURES, PAST

CLAIM DEPARTMENTS, AND PAST LEGAL AND OTHER EXPERTS) MAY NOT REPEAT THEMSELVES,

AS THOSE ITEMS AFFECTING THE TRENDS CHANGE OR EVOLVE DUE TO THE MERGER. THIS

ALSO INCREASED THE POTENTIAL FOR MATERIAL VARIATION IN ESTIMATES, AS EXPERTS

CAN HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS AS TO THE IMPACT OF THESE FREQUENTLY EVOLUTIONARY

CHANGES. EVENTS SUCH AS MERGERS INCREASE THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY OF RESERVE

ESTIMATES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, UNTIL STABLE TRENDS REESTABLISH THEMSELVES

WITHIN THE NEW ORGANIZATION.

RISK FACTORS

THE

MAJOR CAUSES OF MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY (RISK FACTORS) GENERALLY WILL VARY FOR

EACH PRODUCT LINE, AS WELL AS FOR EACH SEPARATELY ANALYZED COMPONENT OF THE

PRODUCT LINE. IN SOME CASES, SUCH RISK FACTORS ARE EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS OF THE

ESTIMATION METHOD AND IN OTHERS, THEY ARE IMPLICIT. FOR EXAMPLE, A METHOD MAY

EXPLICITLY ASSUME THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS WILL CLOSE EACH YEAR, BUT

WILL IMPLICITLY ASSUME THAT THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING CONTRACT

LANGUAGE WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED. ACTUAL RESULTS WILL LIKELY VARY FROM

EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS, RESULTING IN AN ULTIMATE CLAIM

LIABILITY THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT BEING ESTIMATED CURRENTLY.

95

SOME

RISK FACTORS WILL AFFECT MORE THAN ONE PRODUCT LINE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CHANGES

IN CLAIM DEPARTMENT PRACTICES, CHANGES IN SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, REGULATORY AND

LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS, COURT ACTIONS, TIMELINESS OF CLAIM REPORTING, STATE MIX OF

CLAIMANTS, AND DEGREE OF CLAIMANT FRAUD. THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF A RISK

FACTOR WILL ALSO VARY BY COMPONENTS WITHIN A PRODUCT LINE. INDIVIDUAL RISK

FACTORS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER RISK FACTORS WITHIN PRODUCT

LINE COMPONENTS.

THE

EFFECT OF A PARTICULAR RISK FACTOR ON ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES CANNOT BE

ISOLATED IN MOST CASES. FOR EXAMPLE, ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL CLAIM SETTLEMENTS

MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL COURT RULINGS, BUT THE

FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TYPICALLY DOES NOT DELINEATE HOW MUCH OF THE SETTLED

AMOUNT IS DUE TO THIS AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE

EVALUATION OF DATA IS ALSO SUBJECT TO DISTORTION FROM EXTREME EVENTS OR

STRUCTURAL SHIFTS, SOMETIMES IN UNANTICIPATED WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TIMING OF

CLAIMS PAYMENTS IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC REGION WILL BE IMPACTED IF CLAIM ADJUSTERS

ARE TEMPORARILY REASSIGNED FROM THAT REGION TO HELP SETTLE CATASTROPHE CLAIMS

IN ANOTHER REGION.

WHILE

SOME CHANGES IN THE CLAIM ENVIRONMENT ARE SUDDEN IN NATURE (SUCH AS A NEW COURT

RULING AFFECTING THE INTERPRETATION OF ALL CONTRACTS IN THAT JURISDICTION),

OTHERS ARE MORE EVOLUTIONARY. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES CAN OCCUR WHEN MULTIPLE

FACTORS AFFECT FINAL CLAIM VALUES, WITH THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING EACH FACTOR

BEING RESOLVED SEPARATELY, IN STEP-WISE FASHION. THE FINAL IMPACT IS NOT KNOWN

UNTIL ALL STEPS HAVE OCCURRED.

SUDDEN

CHANGES GENERALLY CAUSE A ONE-TIME SHIFT IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, ALTHOUGH

THERE MAY BE SOME LAG IN RELIABLE QUANTIFICATION OF THEIR IMPACT. EVOLUTIONARY

CHANGES GENERALLY CAUSE A SERIES OF SHIFTS IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, AS

EACH COMPONENT OF THE EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE BECOMES EVIDENT AND ESTIMABLE.

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES

AT

LEAST ONCE PER QUARTER, COMPANY MANAGEMENT MEETS WITH ITS ACTUARIES TO REVIEW

THE LATEST CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ANALYSES. BASED ON THESE

ANALYSES, MANAGEMENT DETERMINES WHETHER ITS ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES

SHOULD BE CHANGED. IN DOING SO, IT MUST EVALUATE WHETHER THE NEW DATA PROVIDED

REPRESENTS CREDIBLE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION OR AN ANOMALY THAT WILL HAVE NO

EFFECT ON ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE,

PAYMENTS MAY HAVE DECREASED IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC REGION DUE TO FEWER CLAIM

ADJUSTERS BEING AVAILABLE TO PROCESS CLAIMS. THE RESULTING CLAIM PAYMENT

PATTERNS WOULD BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CHANGE IN PAYMENT

PATTERN REPRESENTS A CHANGE IN ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY.

SUCH

AN ASSESSMENT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT. IT IS FREQUENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO

DETERMINE WHETHER A CHANGE IN THE DATA IS AN ANOMALY UNTIL SOMETIME AFTER THE

EVENT. EVEN IF A CHANGE IS DETERMINED TO BE PERMANENT, IT IS NOT ALWAYS

POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE UNTIL SOMETIME LATER.

THE OVERALL DETAILED ANALYSES SUPPORTING SUCH AN EFFORT CAN TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS

TO PERFORM. THIS IS DUE TO THE NEED TO EVALUATE THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE

TRENDS OBSERVED, AND MAY INCLUDE THE GATHERING OR ASSEMBLING OF DATA NOT

PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. IT MAY ALSO INCLUDE INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH

THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES. AS A RESULT, THERE CAN BE A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE

EMERGENCE OF A CHANGE AND A DETERMINATION THAT THE CHANGE SHOULD BE REFLECTED

IN THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED CLAIM LIABILITIES. THE FINAL ESTIMATE SELECTED BY

MANAGEMENT IN A REPORTING PERIOD IS A FUNCTION OF THESE DETAILED ANALYSES OF

PAST DATA, ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ANY NEW ACTIONABLE INFORMATION.

DISCUSSION OF PRODUCT LINES

THE

FOLLOWING SECTION DETAILS RESERVING CONSIDERATIONS AND COMMON RISK FACTORS

BY PRODUCT LINE. THERE ARE MANY ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT

ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS. EACH RISK FACTOR PRESENTED WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT

ON REQUIRED RESERVES. ALSO, RISK FACTORS CAN HAVE OFFSETTING OR COMPOUNDING

EFFECTS ON REQUIRED RESERVES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN WORKERS COMPENSATION, THE USE OF

EXPENSIVE MEDICAL PROCEDURES THAT RESULT IN MEDICAL COST INFLATION MAY ENABLE

WORKERS TO RETURN TO WORK FASTER, THEREBY LOWERING INDEMNITY COSTS. THUS, IN

ALMOST ALL CASES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCRETELY MEASURE THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE

RISK FACTOR AND CONSTRUCT A MEANINGFUL SENSITIVITY EXPECTATION.

GENERAL LIABILITY

GENERAL

LIABILITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL LINE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY

LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR.

THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC

COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION AND SPECIFIC POLICY PROVISIONS SUCH AS

SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPONENTS UNDERLYING THE GENERAL

LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. SOME OF THESE HAVE RELATIVELY MODERATE PAYMENT PATTERNS

(WITH MOST OF THE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR CLOSED WITHIN 5 TO 7 YEARS),

WHILE OTHERS CAN HAVE EXTREME LAGS IN BOTH REPORTING AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS

(E.G., A REPORTING LAG OF A DECADE FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT CLAIMS).

96

WHILE THE MAJORITY OF GENERAL

LIABILITY COVERAGES ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS, CERTAIN GENERAL

LIABILITY COVERAGES (SUCH AS THOSE COVERING DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OR

PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY) ARE TYPICALLY INSURED ON A CLAIMS-MADE BASIS.

GENERAL LIABILITY RESERVES ARE

GENERALLY ANALYZED AS TWO COMPONENTS: PRIMARY AND EXCESS/UMBRELLA, WITH THE

PRIMARY COMPONENT GENERALLY ANALYZED SEPARATELY FOR BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY

DAMAGE. BODILY INJURY LIABILITY PAYMENTS REIMBURSE THE CLAIMANT FOR DAMAGES

PERTAINING TO PHYSICAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF THE POLICYHOLDERS LEGAL

OBLIGATION ARISING FROM NON-INTENTIONAL ACTS SUCH AS NEGLIGENCE, SUBJECT TO THE

INSURANCE POLICY PROVISIONS. IN SOME CASES THE DAMAGES CAN INCLUDE FUTURE WAGE

LOSS (WHICH IS A FUNCTION OF FUTURE EARNINGS POWER AND WAGE INFLATION) AND

FUTURE MEDICAL TREATMENT COSTS. PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY PAYMENTS RESULT FROM

DAMAGES TO THE CLAIMANTS PRIVATE PROPERTY ARISING FROM THE POLICYHOLDERS

LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR NON-INTENTIONAL ACTS. IN MOST CASES, PROPERTY DAMAGE

LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF COSTS AS OF THE LOSS DATE, OR SOON THEREAFTER. IN

ADDITION, SIZABLE OR UNIQUE EXPOSURES ARE REVIEWED SEPARATELY, SUCH AS

ASBESTOS, ENVIRONMENTAL, OTHER MASS TORTS, CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

AND LARGE UNIQUE ACCOUNTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DISTORT THE ANALYSIS. THESE

UNIQUE CATEGORIES OFTEN REQUIRE A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND REQUIRE

RESERVE ANALYSES THAT DO NOT RELY ON TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS.

DEFENSE COSTS ARE ALSO A PART

OF THE INSURED COSTS COVERED BY LIABILITY POLICIES AND CAN BE SIGNIFICANT,

SOMETIMES GREATER THAN THE COST OF THE ACTUAL PAID CLAIMS. FOR SOME PRODUCTS

THIS RISK IS MITIGATED BY POLICY LANGUAGE SUCH THAT THE INSURED PORTION OF

DEFENSE COSTS ERODES THE AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT AVAILABLE TO PAY THE CLAIM.

SUCH DEFENSE WITHIN THE LIMITS POLICIES ARE MOST COMMON FOR CLAIMS MADE

PRODUCTS. WHEN DEFENSE COSTS ARE OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITS, AMOUNTS PAID DO NOT

ERODE THE POLICY LIMITS.

THIS LINE IS TYPICALLY THE LARGEST

SOURCE OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY IN THE UNITED STATES (EXCLUDING ASSUMED

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS COVERING THE SAME RISK). MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS

RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY INCLUDE THE REPORTING LAG (I.E., THE LENGTH OF

TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING COVERAGE AND THE ACTUAL REPORTING OF THE

CLAIM), THE NUMBER OF PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE UNDERLYING TORT ACTION, WHETHER

THE EVENT TRIGGERING COVERAGE IS CONFINED TO ONLY ONE TIME PERIOD OR IS

SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE TIME PERIODS, THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED (IN THE

INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ACTIONS), WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND

INTENDED TO BE COVERED AT THE TIME THE CONTRACTS WERE WRITTEN (I.E., COVERAGE

DISPUTE POTENTIAL), AND THE POTENTIAL FOR MASS CLAIM ACTIONS. CLAIMS WITH LONGER

REPORTING LAGS RESULT IN GREATER INHERENT RISK. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR

ALLEGED CLAIMS WITH A LATENCY FEATURE, PARTICULARLY WHERE COURTS HAVE RULED

THAT COVERAGE IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE POLICY YEARS, HENCE INVOLVING MULTIPLE

DEFENDANTS (AND THEIR INSURERS AND REINSURERS) AND MULTIPLE POLICIES (THEREBY

INCREASING THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED AND THE UNDERLYING SETTLEMENT

COMPLEXITY). CLAIMS WITH LONG LATENCIES ALSO INCREASE THE POTENTIAL RECOGNITION

LAG, I.E., THE LAG BETWEEN WRITING A TYPE OF POLICY IN A CERTAIN MARKET AND THE

RECOGNITION THAT SUCH POLICIES HAVE POTENTIAL MASS TORT AND/OR LATENT CLAIM

EXPOSURE.

THE AMOUNT OF RESERVE ESTIMATE

UNCERTAINTY ALSO VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY BY COMPONENT FOR THE GENERAL LIABILITY

PRODUCT LINE. THE COMPONENTS IN THIS PRODUCT LINE WITH THE LONGEST LATENCY,

LONGEST REPORTING LAGS, LARGEST POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED, AND GREATEST CLAIM

SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY ARE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL. COMPONENTS THAT INCLUDE

LATENCY, REPORTING LAG AND/OR COMPLEXITY ISSUES, BUT TO A MATERIALLY LESSER

EXTENT THAN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE, AND OTHER MASS TORT ACTIONS. MANY COMPONENTS OF GENERAL LIABILITY

ARE NOT SUBJECT TO MATERIAL LATENCY OR CLAIM COMPLEXITY RISKS AND HENCE HAVE

MATERIALLY LESS UNCERTAINTY THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED COMPONENTS. IN

GENERAL, POLICIES PROVIDING COVERAGE WITH SHORTER REPORTING LAGS, FEWER PARTIES

INVOLVED IN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS, ONLY ONE POLICY POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED PER

CLAIM, FEWER POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOLLARS, REASONABLY FORESEEABLE (AND STABLE)

POTENTIAL HAZARDS/CLAIMS AND NO MASS TORT POTENTIAL RESULT IN MUCH LESS RESERVE

ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY THAN POLICIES WITHOUT THOSE CHARACTERISTICS.

PROPERTY

PROPERTY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL LINE WITH A SIMPLER AND

FASTER CLAIM REPORTING AND ADJUSTMENT PROCESS THAN LIABILITY COVERAGES, AND

LESS UNCERTAINTY IN THE RESERVE SETTING PROCESS (EXCEPT FOR MORE COMPLEX BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION CLAIMS). IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A MODERATE FREQUENCY, LOW TO

MODERATE SEVERITY LINE, EXCEPT FOR CATASTROPHES AND COVERAGE RELATED TO LARGE

PROPERTIES. THE CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE

CLAIM RESERVES IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE INSURER. OVERALL,

THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A LOW ESTIMATION RISK, EXCEPT

POSSIBLY FOR CATASTROPHES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS.

PROPERTY RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN TWO COMPONENTS, ONE FOR

CATASTROPHIC OR OTHER LARGE SINGLE EVENTS, AND ANOTHER FOR ALL OTHER EVENTS.

EXAMPLES OF COMMON RISK FACTORS THAT CAN CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PROVIDES

A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. FOR PROPERTY

COVERAGE, IT GENERALLY TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS,

WHILE FOR THE OTHER COVERAGES, GENERALLY FOR THE LIABILITY COVERAGES, IT TAKES

A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS.

98

THE

RESERVING RISK FOR THIS LINE IS DOMINATED BY THE LIABILITY COVERAGE PORTION OF

THIS PRODUCT, EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY IN THE EVENT OF CATASTROPHIC OR LARGE SINGLE

LOSSES. THE RESERVING RISK FOR THIS LINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE GENERAL

LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE AND THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE

CUSTOMER. COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL IS GENERALLY SOLD TO SMALLER SIZED ACCOUNTS,

WHILE THE CUSTOMER PROFILE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY AND PROPERTY INCLUDE LARGER

CUSTOMERS.

SEE

THE DISCUSSIONS UNDER THE PROPERTY AND GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINES WITH

REGARD TO RESERVING RISK FOR COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

THE

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE IS A MIX OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGES

AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT

ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS

AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO

FINALIZE AND ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. IN

GENERAL, CLAIM REPORTING LAGS ARE MINOR, CLAIM COMPLEXITY IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE,

AND THE LINE IS VIEWED AS HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY. OVERALL,

THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

COMMERCIAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN FOUR COMPONENTS; BODILY INJURY

LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY, COLLISION CLAIMS AND COMPREHENSIVE

CLAIMS. THESE LAST TWO COMPONENTS HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS

AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT PRESENTED.

WORKERS COMPENSATION

WORKERS

COMPENSATION IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL COVERAGE, AS IT TAKES A

RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE CLAIMS FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR.

WHILE CERTAIN PAYMENTS SUCH AS INITIAL MEDICAL TREATMENT OR TEMPORARY WAGE

REPLACEMENT FOR THE INJURED WORKER ARE MADE QUICKLY, SOME OTHER PAYMENTS ARE

MADE OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS, SUCH AS AWARDS FOR PERMANENT PARTIAL

INJURIES. IN ADDITION, SOME PAYMENTS CAN RUN AS LONG AS THE INJURED WORKERS

LIFE, SUCH AS PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS AND ON-GOING MEDICAL CARE. DESPITE

THE POSSIBILITY OF LONG PAYMENT TAILS, THE REPORTING LAGS ARE GENERALLY SHORT,

SETTLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT COMPLEX, AND MOST OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE

CONSIDERED HIGH FREQUENCY WITH MODERATE SEVERITY. THE LARGEST RESERVE RISK

GENERALLY COMES FROM THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY CLAIMS PROVIDING LIFETIME

COVERAGE FOR MEDICAL EXPENSE ARISING FROM A WORKERS INJURY. OVERALL, THE CLAIM

LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A SOMEWHAT GREATER THAN MODERATE ESTIMATION

RISK.

WORKERS

COMPENSATION RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN THREE COMPONENTS: INDEMNITY

LOSSES, MEDICAL LOSSES AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

FIDELITY AND SURETY

FIDELITY

IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. IT TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT

PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE FIDELITY CLAIMS. THE VOLATILITY OF

FIDELITY RESERVES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS OF THE INSURED,

THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE INSUREDS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AMOUNT OF POLICY

LIMIT AND ATTACHMENT POINT OF COVERAGE. THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING RESERVES

FOR SMALL, COMMERCIAL INSUREDS IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN THE UNCERTAINTY FOR LARGE

COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW SEVERITY NATURE

OF SMALL COMMERCIAL FIDELITY LOSSES PROVIDES FOR STABILITY IN LOSS ESTIMATES

WHEREAS, THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY NATURE OF LOSSES FOR LARGE INSUREDS

RESULTS IN A WIDER RANGE OF ULTIMATE LOSS OUTCOMES. ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES THAT

RELY ON A STABLE PATTERN OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT ARE GENERALLY NOT APPLICABLE TO

LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY POLICIES.

SURETY

HAS CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED SHORT TAIL COVERAGES WITH

SHORT REPORTING LAGS, ALTHOUGH LARGE INDIVIDUAL CONSTRUCTION AND COMMERCIAL

SURETY CONTRACTS CAN RESULT IN A SOMEWHAT LONGER SETTLEMENT TAIL, BASED ON THE

LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OR COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION

BEING INSURED. (LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS CAN TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE.)

THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES IN SURETY CORRELATES WITH ECONOMIC CYCLES AS THE

PRIMARY CAUSE OF SURETY LOSS IS THE INABILITY TO PERFORM FINANCIALLY. THE

VOLATILITY OF SURETY LOSSES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS

PERFORMED BY THE INSURED, THE TYPE OF BONDED OBLIGATION, THE AMOUNT OF LIMIT

EXPOSED TO LOSS AND THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS AVAILABLE TO THE INSURER TO MITIGATE

LOSSES, SUCH AS UNBILLED CONTRACT FUNDS, COLLATERAL, FIRST AND THIRD PARTY

INDEMNITY, AND OTHER SECURITY POSITIONS OF AN INSUREDS ASSETS. CERTAIN CLASSES

OF SURETY CLAIMS ARE VERY HIGH SEVERITY, LOW FREQUENCY IN NATURE. THESE CAN

INCLUDE LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS INVOLVED WITH ONE OR MULTIPLE LARGE,

COMPLEX PROJECTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN LARGE COMMERCIAL SURETY EXPOSURES. OTHER

CLAIM FACTORS AFFECTING RESERVE VARIABILITY OF SURETY INCLUDE LITIGATION

RELATED TO AMOUNTS OWED BY AND DUE THE INSURED (E.G., SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION

EFFORTS) AND THE RESULTS OF FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF AN INSURED.

AUTOMOBILE INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE

MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND

AND ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. REPORTING

AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY GENERALLY IS THE LEAST COMPLEX OF THE LIABILITY PRODUCTS.

IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY PRODUCT

LINE. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION

RISK.

IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. MOST PAYMENTS ARE RELATED TO THE

PROPERTY PORTION OF THE POLICY, WHERE THE CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT

PROCESS IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE INSURER. CLAIMS ON

PROPERTY COVERAGE ARE TYPICALLY REPORTED SOON AFTER THE ACTUAL DAMAGE OCCURS,

ALTHOUGH DELAYS OF SEVERAL MONTHS ARE NOT UNUSUAL. THE CLAIM IS SETTLED WHEN

THE TWO PARTIES AGREE ON THE AMOUNT DUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICY CONTRACT

LANGUAGE AND THE APPROPRIATE PAYMENT IS MADE (OR ALTERNATIVELY, THE PROPERTY

REPLACEMENT/REPAIR IS PERFORMED BY THE INSURER). THE RESULTING SETTLEMENT

PROCESS IS TYPICALLY FAIRLY SHORT TERM, ALTHOUGH EXCEPTIONS DO EXIST.

THE

LIABILITY PORTION OF THE HOMEOWNERS POLICY GENERATES CLAIMS WHICH TAKE LONGER

TO PAY DUE TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF LITIGATION AND NEGOTIATION, BUT WITH GENERALLY

SMALL REPORTING LAGS. IN ADDITION, RESERVES RELATED TO UMBRELLA COVERAGES HAVE

GREATER UNCERTAINTY SINCE UMBRELLA LIABILITY PAYMENTS ARE OFTEN MADE FAR INTO

THE FUTURE.

OVERALL,

THE LINE IS GENERALLY HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY (EXCEPT FOR

CATASTROPHES), WITH SIMPLE TO MODERATE CLAIM COMPLEXITY.

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER

INTERNATIONAL

AND OTHER INCLUDES THE INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT LINE AND OTHER PRODUCTS NOT

DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE PRINCIPLE COMPONENT OF OTHER IS ASSUMED REINSURANCE

WRITTEN ON AN EXCESS-OF-LOSS BASIS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE REINSURANCE OF NON-U.S.

EXPOSURES, AND IS PRIMARILY RUNOFF BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL

AND OTHER CLAIM LIABILITIES RESULT FROM A MIX OF COVERAGES, CURRENCIES AND

JURISDICTIONS/COUNTRIES. THE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC IS THE NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE

ANALYSIS TO THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT, AND THE INABILITY TO RELY ON DATA

CHARACTERIZATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. STATUTORY REPORTING

FRAMEWORK.

DUE

TO CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS MIX FOR THIS LINE OVER TIME, THE RECENTLY INCURRED

CLAIM LIABILITIES ARE RELATIVELY SHORT TERM (DUE TO BOTH THE PRODUCTS AND THE

JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED, E.G., THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM),

WHILE THE OLDER LIABILITIES INCLUDE SOME FROM RUNOFF OPERATIONS THAT ARE

EXTREMELY LONG TAIL (E.G., U.S. EXCESS LIABILITIES REINSURED THROUGH THE LONDON

MARKET, AND SEVERAL UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF). THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING

AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE

JURISDICTION, THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (E.G., UNDERWRITING POOL VERSUS DIRECT),

AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE INSURANCE SALE TO THE INSURED HAZARD (E.G., INSURED

AND INSURER LOCATED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES). IN PARTICULAR, LIABILITIES ARISING

FROM THE UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS,

SETTLEMENT LAGS AND CLAIM COMPLEXITY, DUE TO THE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER

POOL MEMBERS OR CO-INSURERS THROUGH A BROKER OR LEAD-INSURER FOR CLAIM

SETTLEMENT PURPOSES.

INTERNATIONAL

AND OTHER RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED BY PROGRAM/POOL, COUNTRY AND GENERAL

COVERAGE CATEGORY (E.G., U.S. LIABILITYEXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE, OR GENERAL

LIABILITY  MUNICIPALITIES  BY COUNTRY.) THE BUSINESS IS ALSO GENERALLY SPLIT

BY DIRECT VERSUS ASSUMED REINSURANCE FOR A GIVEN COVERAGE/JURISDICTION. WHERE

THE UNDERLYING INSURED HAZARD IS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE UNDERLYING

COVERAGES ARE GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER THE GENERAL LIABILITY

AND AUTOMOBILE DISCUSSION ABOVE, BUT UNDER A DIFFERENT LEGAL SYSTEM. WHERE THE

UNDERLYING HAZARD IS WITHIN THE U.S., THE COVERAGE INVOLVED IS TYPICALLY THAT

OF GENERAL LIABILITY, BUT ON AN EXCESS OR EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE BASIS.

EXCESS EXPOSURE REQUIRES THE INSURED TO PROVE NOT ONLY CLAIMS UNDER THE

POLICY, BUT ALSO THE PRIOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS REACHING UP TO THE EXCESS POLICYS

ATTACHMENT POINT.

THE

$810 MILLION INCREASE IN GROSS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES OVER YEAR-END 2004 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO RECOVERABLES RESULTING FROM HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA AND WILMA.

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH

THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS

TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. IN

ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY BECOMES INVOLVED IN

COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS

AND ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO DETERMINE THE COMPANYS

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY

EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE

COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

THE

COMPANY REPORTS ITS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED

UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANYS

ONGOING REVIEW OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION PERIODS, CHANGES IN

REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES, AND OTHER

RELEVANT FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO AN

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES

COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES. THE INCREASE IN THE

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE IN 2005 WAS $53 MILLION.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES

AN

INVESTMENT IN A FIXED MATURITY OR EQUITY SECURITY WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR SALE

OR REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IS IMPAIRED IF ITS FAIR VALUE FALLS BELOW ITS BOOK

VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

FIXED

MATURITIES FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN 80% OF AMORTIZED COST FOR MORE

THAN ONE QUARTER ARE EVALUATED FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. A FIXED

MATURITY IS IMPAIRED IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SECURITYS CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

FACTORS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS IN DETERMINING WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

FOR DEBT SECURITIES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



THE LENGTH OF TIME AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH

FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONCLUDE

THAT THE DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IF THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW

COST FOR SIX TO NINE MONTHS;



THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM

PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER. THE ISSUER MAY BE EXPERIENCING DEPRESSED AND DECLINING

EARNINGS RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS, EROSION OF MARKET SHARE, DETERIORATING

FINANCIAL POSITION, LOWERED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, DECLINES IN SECURITIES RATINGS,

BANKRUPTCY, AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTS THAT INDICATE AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.

ALSO, THE ISSUER MAY EXPERIENCE SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT MAY INFLUENCE ITS

OPERATIONS OR EARNINGS POTENTIAL, SUCH AS CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY,

DISCONTINUATION OF A BUSINESS SEGMENT, CATASTROPHIC LOSSES OR EXHAUSTION OF

NATURAL RESOURCES; AND



THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE

INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED

RECOVERY.

104

EQUITY

INVESTMENTS ARE IMPAIRED WHEN IT BECOMES PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT

RECOVER ITS COST OVER THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD. PUBLIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS

(I.E., COMMON STOCKS) TRADING AT A PRICE THAT IS LESS THAN 80% OF COST FOR MORE

THAN ONE QUARTER ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT. INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANY TIME THE

INVESTMENT HAS SUSTAINED LOSSES AND/OR NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR A

PERIOD OF NINE MONTHS OR MORE. EVENTS TRIGGERING THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC AND NON-PUBLIC EQUITIES MAY INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING, IN ADDITION TO THE CONSIDERATIONS NOTED ABOVE FOR DEBT SECURITIES.

FACTORS

AFFECTING PERFORMANCE.



THE INVESTEE LOSES A PRINCIPAL CUSTOMER OR

SUPPLIER FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SHORT-TERM PROSPECT FOR REPLACEMENT OR

EXPERIENCES OTHER SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS;



THE COMPANY IS PERFORMING SUBSTANTIALLY AND

CONSISTENTLY BEHIND PLAN;



THE INVESTEE HAS ANNOUNCED, OR THE COMPANY

HAS BECOME AWARE OF, ADVERSE CHANGES OR EVENTS SUCH AS CHANGES OR PLANNED

CHANGES IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT, RESTRUCTURINGS, OR A SALE OF ASSETS; AND



THE REGULATORY, ECONOMIC, OR TECHNOLOGICAL

ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED IN A WAY THAT IS EXPECTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

INVESTEES PROFITABILITY.

FACTORS

AFFECTING ON-GOING FINANCIAL CONDITION.



FACTORS THAT RAISE DOUBTS ABOUT THE INVESTEES

ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, SUCH AS NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM

OPERATIONS, WORKING-CAPITAL DEFICIENCIES, INVESTMENT ADVISORS RECOMMENDATIONS,

OR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OR DEBT COVENANTS;



A SECONDARY EQUITY OFFERING AT A PRICE

SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THE HOLDERS COST;



A BREACH OF A COVENANT OR THE FAILURE TO

SERVICE DEBT; AND



FRAUD WITHIN THE COMPANY.

FOR

FIXED MATURITY AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, FACTORS THAT MAY INDICATE THAT A DECLINE

IN VALUE IS NOT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



THE SECURITIES OWNED CONTINUE TO GENERATE

REASONABLE EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS, DESPITE A GENERAL STOCK MARKET DECLINE;



BOND INTEREST OR PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDEND

RATE (ON COST) IS LOWER THAN RATES FOR SIMILAR SECURITIES ISSUED CURRENTLY BUT

QUALITY OF INVESTMENT IS NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED;



THE INVESTMENT IS PERFORMING AS EXPECTED AND

IS CURRENT ON ALL EXPECTED PAYMENTS;



SPECIFIC, RECOGNIZABLE, SHORT-TERM FACTORS

HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET VALUE; AND



FINANCIAL CONDITION, MARKET SHARE, BACKLOG

AND OTHER KEY STATISTICS INDICATE GROWTH.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

THE

CARRYING VALUES OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN

EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE. THE REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL

ESTATE PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE

PROPERTY.

105

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

OTHER

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY

NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INSTRUMENTS, CONSISTING OF EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES AND,

HISTORICALLY, HAVING A HOLDING PERIOD OF FOUR TO SEVEN YEARS. THESE INVESTMENTS

HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN MADE IN THE HEALTH CARE, SOFTWARE AND COMPUTER SERVICES,

AND NETWORKING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES INFRASTRUCTURES INDUSTRIES. THE

COMPANY TYPICALLY IS INVOLVED WITH VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES EARLY IN THEIR

FORMATION, AS THEY ARE DEVELOPING AND DETERMINING THE VIABILITY OF, AND MARKET

DEMAND FOR, THEIR PRODUCT. GENERALLY THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE VENTURE

CAPITAL COMPANIES TO RECORD REVENUES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT,

WHICH CAN OFTEN TAKE THREE TO FOUR YEARS, AND DOES NOT GENERALLY EXPECT THEM TO

BECOME PROFITABLE FOR AN EVEN LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. WITH RESPECT TO THE

COMPANYS VALUATION OF SUCH NON-PUBLICLY TRADED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, ON

A QUARTERLY BASIS, PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AS WELL AS AN INTERNAL VALUATION

COMMITTEE REVIEW AND CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL

FOR LOSS IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



THE ISSUERS MOST RECENT FINANCING EVENT;



AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER FUNDAMENTAL

DETERIORATION HAS OCCURRED;



WHETHER OR NOT THE ISSUERS PROGRESS HAS BEEN

SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN EXPECTED;



WHETHER OR NOT THE VALUATIONS HAVE DECLINED

SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE ENTITYS MARKET SECTOR;



WHETHER OR NOT THE INTERNAL VALUATION

COMMITTEE BELIEVES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ISSUER WILL NEED FINANCING WITHIN

SIX MONTHS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN OUR CARRYING VALUE; AND



WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE THE ABILITY AND INTENT

TO HOLD THE SECURITY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY,

ENABLING US TO RECEIVE VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN OUR COST.

THE

QUARTERLY VALUATION PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE PORTFOLIO

MANAGERS ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY TO FREQUENTLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING

THOSE INVESTED ASSETS, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EVENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE

RISE TO IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS.

THE

COMPANY MANAGES THE PORTFOLIO TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM RETURN, EVALUATING CURRENT

MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR THE ENTITIES IN WHICH IT HAS

INVESTED. BECAUSE THIS PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF PRIVATELY-HELD,

EARLY-STAGE VENTURE INVESTMENTS, EVENTS GIVING RISE TO IMPAIRMENT CAN OCCUR IN

A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME (E.G., THE ENTITY HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN SECURING

ADDITIONAL FINANCING, OTHER INVESTORS DECIDE TO WITHDRAW THEIR SUPPORT,

COMPLICATIONS ARISE IN THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, ETC.), AND DECISIONS

ARE MADE AT THAT POINT IN TIME, BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WITH

RESPECT TO A RECOGNITION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OR SALE OF THE

INVESTMENT.

NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS

THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS, SUCH

AS VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT

VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, AND CERTAIN FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. CERTAIN

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY ARE CONSOLIDATED

IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR JOINT VENTURES, LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY

SECURITIES. CERTAIN OTHER PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS, ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (FAS) NO. 115,

ACCOUNTING

FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES,

BUT ARE

REPORTED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 60,

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY INSURANCE ENTERPRISES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE

DETERMINED BY AN INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE FOR SECURITIES FOR WHICH THERE IS

NO PUBLIC MARKET. THE INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE REVIEWS SUCH FACTORS AS

RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH, AND OTHER

BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTAL STATISTICS IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUES OF

SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS. OTHER NON-PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON

FACTORS SUCH AS MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, RECENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER

MARKET DATA. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF, BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS

AND CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER

ALL OF THE COST OF AN INDIVIDUAL HOLDING.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THIS

REPORT MAY CONTAIN, AND MANAGEMENT MAY MAKE, CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT

OF 1995.  ALL STATEMENTS, OTHER THAN STATEMENTS OF HISTORICAL FACTS, MAY

BE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  SPECIFICALLY, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, PREMIUM VOLUME, INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS,

NET AND OPERATING INCOME AND RETURN ON EQUITY), FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

LIQUIDITY; THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS AND OTHER RESERVES

(INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, ASBESTOS CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS); THE POST-MERGER

INTEGRATION (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, EXPENSE SAVINGS); THE COST AND

AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE COVERAGE; AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.  SUCH

STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT

TO PREDICT AND GENERALLY BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL, THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED IN, OR IMPLIED OR PROJECTED

BY, THE FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION AND STATEMENTS.

107

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

MARKET

RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND

PRICES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER

RELEVANT MARKET RATE OR PRICE CHANGES. MARKET RISK IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY

THE VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE RELATED UNDERLYING

ASSETS ARE TRADED. THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY

MARKET RISK EXPOSURES AND HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005. THE COMPANYS MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES,

ARE PRIMARILY ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING.

THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND 2004 WAS $68.29 BILLION AND $64.37 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 86% AND

84% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 AND 2004, APPROXIMATELY 6% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANYS INVESTED

ASSETS WERE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO EQUITY

PRICE RISK IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY HAS NO DIRECT COMMODITY RISK.

THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INTEREST RATE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES. THE PORTFOLIO

DURATION RELATIVE TO THE LIABILITIES DURATION IS PRIMARILY MANAGED THROUGH

CASH MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND TREASURY FUTURES TRANSACTIONS.

THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISK FOR ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT IS INTEREST RATE RISK AT THE

TIME OF REFINANCING. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND

EVALUATES REFINANCING OPPORTUNITIES AS MATURITY DATES APPROACH. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS DEBT SEE NOTE 10 TO THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL

RESOURCES SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.

THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURE IS CONCENTRATED IN THE COMPANYS

INVESTED ASSETS AND INSURANCE RESERVES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. CASH

FLOWS FROM THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR

THE PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY

PURCHASES THESE INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY TO FUND INSURANCE RESERVES AND OTHER

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN THE SAME CURRENCY, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING ITS FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN THE BRITISH

POUND STERLING COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 2.4% AND 3.5% OF THE TOTAL INVESTED

ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL FOREIGN

CURRENCY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 1.8% OF THE COMPANYS INVESTED ASSETS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 OR 2004.

THERE

WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS PRIMARY MARKET RISK

EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES WERE MANAGED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER

31, 2005 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ITS PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES

OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS BASED UPON

WHAT IS KNOWN OR EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

SENSITIVITY

ANALYSIS IS DEFINED AS THE MEASUREMENT OF POTENTIAL LOSS IN FUTURE EARNINGS,

FAIR VALUES OR CASH FLOWS OF MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS RESULTING FROM ONE OR

MORE SELECTED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET RATES OR

PRICES OVER A SELECTED TIME. IN THE COMPANYS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, A

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET RATES IS SELECTED THAT IS EXPECTED TO REFLECT

REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN THOSE RATES. NEAR-TERM MEANS A

PERIOD OF TIME GOING FORWARD UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN

MARKET RATES ASSUMED IN THIS DISCLOSURE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS SENSITIVITY

ANALYSIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE RESULTS OF ANY ACTIONS THAT WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE

COMPANY TO MITIGATE SUCH HYPOTHETICAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE.

INTEREST RATE RISK

IN

THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES TO MEASURE ITS

POTENTIAL LOSS. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING: FIXED MATURITIES,

NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, MORTGAGE LOANS, SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, DEBT

AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO THE COMPANYS

MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INTEREST RATE RISK. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

MODEL USES A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES TO MEASURE THE

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MODEL.

108

FOR

INVESTED ASSETS WITH PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, ESTIMATES OF

PORTFOLIO DURATION AND CONVEXITY ARE USED TO MODEL THE LOSS OF FAIR VALUE THAT

WOULD BE EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM A PARALLEL INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES.

DURATIONS ON INVESTED ASSETS ARE ADJUSTED FOR CALL, PUT AND INTEREST RATE RESET

FEATURES. DURATIONS ON TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES ARE ADJUSTED FOR THE FACT THAT THE

YIELDS ON SUCH SECURITIES DO NOT NORMALLY MOVE IN LOCKSTEP WITH CHANGES IN THE

U.S. TREASURY CURVE. FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO DURATIONS ARE CALCULATED ON A

MARKET VALUE WEIGHTED BASIS, INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST, USING HOLDINGS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004.

FOR

DEBT, THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY CALCULATING HYPOTHETICAL

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004 ENDING PRICES BASED ON YIELDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT A

100 BASIS POINT CHANGE, COMPARING SUCH HYPOTHETICAL ENDING PRICES TO ACTUAL

ENDING PRICES, AND MULTIPLYING THE DIFFERENCE BY THE PAR OR SECURITIES

OUTSTANDING.

THE

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USED BY THE COMPANY PRODUCES A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF

MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION AND $2.1 BILLION

BASED ON A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

LOSS ESTIMATES DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE INTERVENTIONS

THAT THE COMPANY MIGHT REASONABLY UNDERTAKE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE OR AVOID

LOSSES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM EMERGING INTEREST RATE TRENDS. IN ADDITION, THE

LOSS VALUE ONLY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF AN INTEREST RATE INCREASE ON THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AS A RESULT, THE LOSS VALUE

EXCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET,

WHICH IF INCLUDED IN THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, WOULD MITIGATE THE IMPACT

OF THE LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN

INTEREST RATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

THE

COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS

FROM FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS. A HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN VALUE OF

FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT ON THE MARKET

VALUE OF THE FOREIGN DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. THE POTENTIAL LOSS IS REDUCED BY

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT

A HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS

WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $374 MILLION

AND $438 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND

SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.        SUMMARY OF

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

(TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY). ON APRIL 1, 2004, TRAVELERS

PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) MERGED WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF THE ST. PAUL

COMPANIES, INC. (SPC), AS A RESULT OF WHICH TPC BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES,

THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE ACQUISITION WITH TPC TREATED AS

THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIRER. ACCORDINGLY, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION, USING TPCS HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND

APPLYING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

COMMITMENTS OF SPC AS OF APRIL 1, 2004. (SEE NOTE 2 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED). BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF SPC WERE CONSOLIDATED WITH TPCS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ACCORDINGLY, ALL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

PRESENTED HEREIN FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 REFLECTS THE

CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS OF SPC AND TPC. THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED

HEREIN FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 REFLECTS ONLY THE ACCOUNTS

OF TPC FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 AND THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS

OF SPC AND TPC FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE FINANCIAL

INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN FOR 2003 REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTS OF TPC. CERTAIN

RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO PRIOR YEARS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO

CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEARS PRESENTATION. SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE

MERGER, EACH ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARE OF TPC CLASS A AND CLASS B COMMON

STOCK (INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS) WAS EXCHANGED

FOR 0.4334 OF A SHARE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. SHARE AND PER SHARE

AMOUNTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE EXCHANGE OF

TPCS COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.01 PER SHARE, FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK

WITHOUT DESIGNATED PAR VALUE. COMMON STOCK AND ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL IN

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WERE ALSO RESTATED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE

DIFFERENCE IN PAR VALUE OF THE EXCHANGED SHARES. CASH WAS PAID IN LIEU OF

FRACTIONAL SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER, HISTORICAL TPC SHAREHOLDERS HELD APPROXIMATELY 66%

OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE MERGER,

SEE NOTE 2.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY AND NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INC. (NUVEEN INVESTMENTS),

THE COMPANYS ASSET MANAGEMENT SUBSIDIARY, JOINTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMPANY

WOULD IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO DIVEST ITS 78% EQUITY INTEREST IN NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS, WHICH CONSTITUTED THE COMPANYS ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENT AND WAS

ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE MERGER ON APRIL 1, 2004. THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE

DIVESTITURE THROUGH A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS IN 2005. THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS RESULTS WAS CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, AND THE COMPANYS RESULTS FOR PRIOR PERIODS

WERE RECLASSIFIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE 2005 PRESENTATION. THE COMPANYS

OWNERSHIP IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004

WERE NETTED AND REPORTED AS NET ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. SEE NOTE 3.

THE PREPARATION OF THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND CLAIMS AND EXPENSES DURING

THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

AMERICAN

JOBS CREATION ACT  REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS

ON OCTOBER 22,

2004, CONGRESS ENACTED THE

AMERICAN JOBS

CREATION ACT

(AJCA) WHICH PROVIDED A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S.

CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS PREVIOUSLY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES TO OBTAIN AN 85% DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION. IN DECEMBER 2004,

FSP NO. 109-2,

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE

GUIDANCE FOR THE FOREIGN EARNINGS REPATRIATION PROVISION WITHIN THE AMERICAN

JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

WAS ISSUED. THIS FSP PROVIDES ACCOUNTING

AND DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE ON HOW TO APPLY

FASB

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

, TO THE REPATRIATION PROVISION

OF THE AJCA. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY APPROVED A DOMESTIC

REINVESTMENT PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AJCA TO REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS

PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED $158

MILLION OF CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EARNINGS INVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES,

WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005.

116

ACCOUNTING POLICIES NOT YET ADOPTED

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB

ISSUED REVISED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(FAS 123R), AN

AMENDMENT TO FAS 123 AND A REPLACEMENT OF APB OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

,

AND ITS RELATED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE. FAS 123R REQUIRES PUBLIC ENTITIES TO

MEASURE THE COST OF EMPLOYEE SERVICES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AWARD OF

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD, AND TO

RECOGNIZE THAT COST OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD.

FAS 123R, WHICH BECAME

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, REQUIRES ENTITIES THAT USE THE FAIR-VALUE METHOD OF

EITHER RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE UNDER FAS 123, TO APPLY A MODIFIED VERSION OF

THE PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION. UNDER MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION,

COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR ALL UNVESTED

AWARDS, BASED ON THEIR GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE AS CALCULATED UNDER FAS 123 FOR

EITHER RECOGNITION OR PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE PURPOSES.

IN ADDITION, THE ACCOUNTING

FOR CERTAIN GRANTS OF EQUITY AWARDS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE

ON THE DATE OF GRANT HAS BEEN CLARIFIED. FAS 123R STATES THAT AN EMPLOYEES

SHARE-BASED AWARD BECOMES VESTED AT THE DATE THAT THE EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO RECEIVE

OR RETAIN EQUITY SHARES IS NO LONGER CONTINGENT ON THE SATISFACTION OF A

MARKET, PERFORMANCE OR SERVICE CONDITION. ACCORDINGLY, AWARDS GRANTED TO

RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ARE NOT CONTINGENT ON SATISFYING A SERVICE

CONDITION AND THEREFORE ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT.

ADDITIONALLY, THE PERIOD OVER WHICH COST IS RECOGNIZED FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO

THOSE WHO BECOME RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE BEFORE THE VESTING DATE, WILL BE FROM THE

GRANT DATE TO THE RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE DATE RATHER THAN TO THE VESTING DATE.

THIS GUIDANCE IS TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO NEW OR MODIFIED AWARDS GRANTED

UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 123R.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE FAIR

VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING UNDER FAS 123 ON JANUARY 1, 2003.

THE IMPACT OF FAS 123R WILL BE: A.) THE

RECOGNITION OF ADDITIONAL EXPENSE IN EARNINGS FOR THE REMAINING UNAMORTIZED

EXPENSE RELATING TO UNVESTED AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF

FAS 123 (JANUARY 1, 2003) AND WHICH REMAIN OUTSTANDING ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION

OF FAS 123R AND B.) THE ACCELERATED RECOGNITION OF COMPENSATION COST

ATTRIBUTABLE TO AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREE ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OR TO EMPLOYEES

THAT BECOME RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE BEFORE AN AWARDS VESTING DATE FOR WHICH THE

RIGHT TO RECEIVE OR RETAIN EQUITY SHARES IS NO LONGER CONTINGENT ON THE

SATISFACTION OF A MARKET PERFORMANCE OR SERVICE CONDITION. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING FAS 123R TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

MODIFICATIONS OR EXCHANGES OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE (ACSEC)

ISSUED STATEMENT OF POSITION 05-1,

ACCOUNTING BY INSURANCE ENTERPRISES FOR DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS IN

CONNECTION WITH MODIFICATIONS OR EXCHANGES OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS (

SOP 05-1). SOP 05-1 PROVIDES GUIDANCE

ON ACCOUNTING BY INSURANCE ENTERPRISES FOR DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS (DAC) ON

INTERNAL REPLACEMENTS OF INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS OTHER THAN THOSE

SPECIFICALLY DESCRIBED IN FAS 97,

ACCOUNTING

117

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INVESTMENTS

FIXED MATURITIES INCLUDE

BONDS, NOTES AND REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS. FIXED MATURITIES ARE VALUED BASED

UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR DEALER QUOTES, OR IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR

DEALER QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, DISCOUNTED EXPECTED CASH FLOWS USING MARKET

RATES COMMENSURATE WITH THE CREDIT QUALITY AND MATURITY OF THE INVESTMENT. ALSO

INCLUDED IN FIXED MATURITIES ARE LOAN-BACKED AND STRUCTURED SECURITIES, WHICH

ARE AMORTIZED USING THE RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THE EFFECTIVE YIELD USED TO

DETERMINE AMORTIZATION IS CALCULATED BASED UPON ACTUAL HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM A WIDELY-ACCEPTED SECURITIES DATA

PROVIDER. FIXED MATURITIES, INCLUDING INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO SECURITIES LENDING

AGREEMENTS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR

VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF INCOME TAXES,

CREDITED OR CHARGED DIRECTLY TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH

INCLUDE COMMON AND NONREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE

FOR SALE AND CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, NET OF INCOME TAX, ARE CHARGED OR CREDITED

DIRECTLY TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

MORTGAGE LOANS ARE CARRIED

AT AMORTIZED COST. A MORTGAGE LOAN IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST AMOUNTS DUE.

FOR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED, A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED

FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST AND FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY USES INTEREST

RATES REFLECTING THE CURRENT REAL ESTATE FINANCING MARKET RETURNS. IMPAIRED

LOANS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004.

THE COMPANYS REAL ESTATE

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE WAREHOUSES AND OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL LAND

AND PROPERTIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY OWNED. REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES ARE CARRIED AT

COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT

LINE BASIS OVER THE SHORTER OF THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OF THE BUILDING OR 39

YEARS. ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ON REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES WAS

$48 MILLION AND $22 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF REAL

ESTATE PROPERTIES ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE

REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL ESTATE

PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY.

RENTAL INCOME IS RECOGNIZED

ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. SEE NOTE 6.

REAL ESTATE HELD FOR SALE IS

CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO SELL. FAIR

VALUE IS ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION BY INTERNAL ANALYSIS OR

EXTERNAL APPRAISERS, USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND OTHER ACCEPTABLE

TECHNIQUES. THEREAFTER, IMPAIRMENT IS TAKEN IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

PROPERTY EXCEEDS ITS CURRENT FAIR VALUE LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO SELL. THE

COMPANY HAD NO REAL ESTATE HELD FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 OR 2004.

ACCRUAL OF INCOME IS

SUSPENDED ON FIXED MATURITIES OR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT ARE IN DEFAULT, OR ON

WHICH IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AS SCHEDULED. INTEREST

INCOME ON INVESTMENTS IN DEFAULT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY AS PAYMENT IS RECEIVED.

INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET THAT WERE NOT

INCOME-PRODUCING FOR THE PRECEDING 12 MONTHS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES,

CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER DEBT ISSUES

PURCHASED WITH A MATURITY OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR, ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST,

WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE.

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, THROUGH DIRECT OWNERSHIP AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS;

PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS; JOINT VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED

PARTNERSHIPS, AND TRADING SECURITIES. CERTAIN VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT

ARE CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR JOINT

VENTURES, LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY SECURITIES.

UNDISTRIBUTED INCOME IS REPORTED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME. TRADING SECURITIES

ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN NET INVESTMENT

INCOME DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD.

118

INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT

GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF PRETAX REVENUES BASED UPON

SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE INVESTMENTS SOLD ON THE TRADE DATE. A DECLINE IN

THE VALUE OF A SECURITY BELOW ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS IS ASSESSED TO DETERMINE

IF THE DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. IF SO, THE SECURITY IS DEEMED TO BE

IMPAIRED, AND A CHARGE IS RECORDED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM

REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM

LIABILITY. SUCH RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED

UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND AMOUNTS DUE FROM KNOWN REINSURER

INSOLVENCIES. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS

REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO

SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

AMOUNTS WHICH VARY WITH AND

ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION OF NEW INSURANCE CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY

COMMISSIONS AND PREMIUM-RELATED TAXES, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED PRO RATA OVER

THE CONTRACT PERIODS IN WHICH THE RELATED PREMIUMS ARE EARNED. DEFERRED

ACQUISITION COSTS ARE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE

INCOME AND, IF NOT, ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. FUTURE INVESTMENT INCOME

ATTRIBUTABLE TO RELATED PREMIUMS IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MEASURING THE

RECOVERABILITY OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THIS ASSET. ALL OTHER ACQUISITION

EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED.

CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

UNDER CERTAIN WORKERS

COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS

OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS

SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE POLICYHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. THESE

AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN

CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES AND CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY USING A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP IS

PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT AND, IF NECESSARY, THE SECOND STEP

IS PERFORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEASURING THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET

EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT

ARE NOT DEEMED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

USEFUL LIVES. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT DEEMED TO

HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE IS REGULARLY REVIEWED FOR INDICATORS OF

IMPAIRMENTS IN VALUE. IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF

THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE FROM ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND IS

MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE ASSET.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT ESTIMATED PROVISIONS FOR BOTH REPORTED AND

UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND RELATED EXPENSES. THE RESERVES ARE ADJUSTED

REGULARLY BASED UPON EXPERIENCE. INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ARE CERTAIN RESERVES

DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE LIABILITIES

FOR LOSSES FOR SOME LONG-TERM DISABILITY PAYMENTS UNDER WORKERS COMPENSATION

INSURANCE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE, WHICH TOTALED $1.92

BILLION AND $1.99 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, WERE

DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND A RANGE OF RATES FROM

3.5% TO 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. RESERVES RELATED TO CERTAIN FIXED AND

DETERMINABLE ASBESTOS-RELATED SETTLEMENTS, WHERE ALL PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND THEIR

TIMING ARE KNOWN, TOTALED $34 MILLION AND $67 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND

2004, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESERVES WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 2.6% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND A RANGE OF RATES FROM 2.3% TO 2.6% AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

RESERVES FOR CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER WERE

DISCOUNTED USING A RANGE OF RATES FROM 5% TO 7.5%, AND TOTALED $79 MILLION AND

$126 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

119

IN DETERMINING CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, THE COMPANY CARRIES ON A CONTINUING REVIEW

OF ITS OVERALL POSITION, ITS RESERVING TECHNIQUES AND ITS REINSURANCE. THE

RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY A QUALIFIED ACTUARY EMPLOYED BY THE

COMPANY. THESE RESERVES REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE COST OF ALL INCURRED

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. SINCE THE RESERVES ARE BASED ON

ESTIMATES, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN SUCH RESERVES. THE

EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATED RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. SUCH CHANGES MAY

BE MATERIAL TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD

OCCUR IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE

THE COMPANY ENGAGES IN

SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES NET INVESTMENT INCOME

FROM THE LENDING OF CERTAIN OF ITS INVESTMENTS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT

PERIODS OF TIME. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2004, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW

SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENT. BORROWERS OF THESE SECURITIES PROVIDE COLLATERAL

EQUAL TO AT LEAST 102% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES PLUS

ACCRUED INTEREST. THIS COLLATERAL IS HELD BY A THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN, AND THE

COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE COLLATERAL ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THE

INSTITUTION BORROWING THE COMPANYS SECURITIES IS IN DEFAULT UNDER THE LENDING

AGREEMENT. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RECEIPT OF THE

COLLATERAL HELD BY THE THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN OR THE OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE

COLLATERAL. THE LOANED SECURITIES REMAIN A RECORDED ASSET OF THE COMPANY.

OTHER LIABILITIES

INCLUDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IS THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ITS

LIABILITY FOR GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. THE

LIABILITY FOR EXPECTED STATE GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER PREMIUM-BASED ASSESSMENTS

IS RECOGNIZED AS THE COMPANY WRITES OR BECOMES OBLIGATED TO WRITE OR RENEW THE

PREMIUMS ON WHICH THE ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE BASED. THE LIABILITY FOR

LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE RELATED LOSSES ARE INCURRED. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, THE COMPANY HAD A LIABILITY OF $278 MILLION AND

$249 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS AND RELATED

RECOVERABLES OF $12 MILLION AND $31 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE LIABILITY FOR

SUCH ASSESSMENTS AND THE RELATED RECOVERABLES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED FOR THE TIME

VALUE OF MONEY. THE ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PAID OVER A PERIOD RANGING

FROM ONE YEAR TO THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF CERTAIN WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMANTS

AND THE RECOVERIES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME.

ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES IS AN ACCRUAL FOR POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS. CERTAIN INSURANCE

CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY WORKERS COMPENSATION, ARE PARTICIPATING WHEREBY DIVIDENDS

ARE PAID TO POLICYHOLDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACT PROVISIONS. NET WRITTEN

PREMIUMS FOR PARTICIPATING DIVIDEND POLICIES WERE APPROXIMATELY 1% OF TOTAL

COMPANY NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005,

2004 AND 2003. POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS ARE ACCRUED AGAINST EARNINGS USING BEST

AVAILABLE ESTIMATES OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID. THE LIABILITY ACCRUED FOR

POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS TOTALED $30 MILLION AND $28 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES, DOMICILED PRINCIPALLY IN THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT AND MINNESOTA,

PREPARE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES PRESCRIBED OR PERMITTED BY THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATES OF

DOMICILE. PRESCRIBED STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES ARE THOSE PRACTICES THAT

ARE INCORPORATED DIRECTLY OR BY REFERENCE IN STATE LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND

GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE RULES APPLICABLE TO ALL INSURANCE ENTERPRISES DOMICILED

IN A PARTICULAR STATE. PERMITTED STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES INCLUDE

PRACTICES NOT PRESCRIBED BY THE DOMICILIARY STATE, BUT ALLOWED BY THE

DOMICILIARY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY. THE IMPACT OF ANY PERMITTED ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES ON STATUTORY SURPLUS OF THE COMPANY IS NOT MATERIAL.

PREMIUMS AND UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES

PREMIUMS ARE RECOGNIZED AS

REVENUES PRO RATA OVER THE POLICY PERIOD. UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES REPRESENT

THE UNEXPIRED PORTION OF POLICY PREMIUMS. ACCRUED RETROSPECTIVE PREMIUMS ARE

INCLUDED IN PREMIUM BALANCES RECEIVABLE. PREMIUM BALANCES RECEIVABLE ARE

REPORTED NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE PREMIUM AMOUNTS.

120

CEDED PREMIUMS ARE CHARGED

TO INCOME OVER THE APPLICABLE TERM OF THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH

THIRD PARTY REINSURERS. PREPAID REINSURANCE PREMIUMS REPRESENT THE UNEXPIRED

PORTION OF PREMIUMS CEDED TO REINSURERS AND ARE REPORTED AS PART OF OTHER

ASSETS.

FEE INCOME

FEE INCOME INCLUDES

SERVICING FEES FROM CARRIERS AND REVENUES FROM LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES AND SERVICE

CONTRACTS AND IS RECOGNIZED PRO RATA OVER THE CONTRACT OR POLICY PERIODS.

OTHER REVENUES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND TAX

RETURN BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, BASED ON ENACTED TAX RATES AND OTHER

PROVISIONS OF THE TAX LAW. THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN TAX LAWS OR RATES ON

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH SUCH CHANGE IS ENACTED. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ALL OR SOME PORTION OF THE

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY ASSIGNS

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES TO ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY THE

CURRENCIES OF THE LOCAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNTS ARE

REMEASURED TO THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, AND THE RESULTING FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS

OR LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS

ARE THEN TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS FROM THIS

TRANSLATION, NET OF TAX, IS RECORDED AS A PART OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE

CHANGE IN UNREALIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION GAIN OR LOSS DURING THE YEAR,

NET OF TAX, IS A COMPONENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. BOTH THE REMEASUREMENT AND

TRANSLATION ARE CALCULATED USING CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE BALANCE SHEETS

AND AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS AN EMPLOYEE

STOCK INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN THAT INCLUDES STOCK-BASED AWARDS OF STOCK

OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND DEFERRED STOCK.

FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE

AWARDS GRANTED, MODIFIED, OR SETTLED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY APPLIES

THE FAS 123 FAIR VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. UNDER THIS METHOD, COMPENSATION

COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND

RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS, THE

FAIR VALUE IS MEASURED AT THE MARKET PRICE OF A SHARE ON THE GRANT DATE WHILE

FOR STOCK OPTION AWARDS THE FAIR VALUE IS DERIVED BY THE APPLICATION OF AN

OPTION PRICING MODEL AT DATE OF GRANT.

FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE

AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THESE AWARDS

UNDER THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD

OPINION NO. 25 (APB 25), 

ACCOUNTING

FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS USING

THE PROSPECTIVE RECOGNITION TRANSITION ALTERNATIVE OF FAS 148. FOR RESTRICTED

STOCK AWARDS, THE MARKET VALUE ON GRANT DATE OF THESE AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED AS

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR STOCK OPTION AWARDS,

THE AWARDS ARE GRANTED AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE MARKET VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT AND ACCORDINGLY THERE HAS BEEN

NO EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THE STOCK OPTION

AWARDS. THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003 USING

APB 25 WILL CEASE UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 123R JANUARY 1, 2006 (SEE NOTE 1,

ACCOUNTING POLICIES NOT YET ADOPTED - SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

).

121

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN APRIL 2004,

THE COMPANY ASSUMED 23 MILLION OUTSTANDING SPC STOCK OPTIONS, OF WHICH 4

MILLION REMAINED UNVESTED AND ASSUMED APPROXIMATELY 240,000 OF OUTSTANDING SPC

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS RELATED TO SPC EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THESE

STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS RETAINED THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS

THAT WERE APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE MERGER. AT APRIL 1, 2004, THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUES OF THE UNVESTED STOCK OPTION AWARDS AND THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS WERE

$35 MILLION AND $9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE INCLUDED IN UNEARNED

COMPENSATION AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF EQUITY. THE UNEARNED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE IS BEING RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO INCOME OVER THE REMAINING VESTING

PERIOD.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE

ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR EACH PERIOD

INDICATED AS IF THE COMPANY HAD APPLIED THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS

OF FAS 123 TO ALL OUTSTANDING AND UNVESTED STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE AWARDS.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY MAY USE

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EQUITY SWAPS,

CREDIT DERIVATIVES, OPTIONS, FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL FUTURES, AS A

MEANS OF HEDGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE, EQUITY PRICE CHANGE AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK. THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES ALL

DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER

CONTRACTS, AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

AND MEASURES THOSE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE. WHERE APPLICABLE, HEDGE

ACCOUNTING IS USED TO ACCOUNT FOR DERIVATIVES. TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING,

THE CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE MUST BE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET

THE CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM. HEDGES ARE MONITORED TO ENSURE THAT

THERE IS A HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE HEDGED INVESTMENT. DERIVATIVES THAT

DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH THE CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN NET REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EQUITY

SWAPS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, OPTIONS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED

INTO THREE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL, SPECIALTY AND PERSONAL.

THESE SEGMENTS REFLECT THE MANNER BY WHICH THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND INSURANCE-RELATED SERVICES AND REPRESENT AN

AGGREGATION OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BASED ON TYPE OF CUSTOMER, HOW THE

BUSINESS IS MARKETED, AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN.

BEGINNING IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2005, THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS UNDERWRITING GROUP INCLUDES THE

COMPANYS DISCOVER RE OPERATION. DISCOVER RES RESULTS WERE RECLASSIFIED TO THE

COMMERCIAL SEGMENT FROM THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT TO ALIGN THE SEGMENT REPORTING

STRUCTURE WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS MANAGED AFTER

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE IN 2005. PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS

WERE RESTATED TO REFLECT THE RECLASSIFICATION OF DISCOVER RE.

122

INVESTED AND OTHER ASSETS

AND NET INVESTMENT INCOME (NII) OF HISTORICAL TPC HAD BEEN SPECIFICALLY

IDENTIFIED BY REPORTING SEGMENT PRIOR TO THE MERGER. BEGINNING IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY DEVELOPED A METHODOLOGY TO ALLOCATE NII AND INVESTED

ASSETS TO THE IDENTIFIED SEGMENTS. THIS METHODOLOGY ALLOCATES PRETAX NII BASED

UPON AN INVESTABLE FUNDS CONCEPT, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT LIABILITIES (NET OF

NON-INVESTED ASSETS) AND APPROPRIATE CAPITAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EACH SEGMENT.

THE INVESTMENT YIELD FOR INVESTABLE FUNDS REFLECTS THE DURATION OF THE LOSS

RESERVES FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME THE

LOSSES WERE INCURRED AND A+ RATED CORPORATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THIS DURATION

YIELD IS COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE PORTFOLIO YIELD AND A NEW AVERAGE YIELD IS

DETERMINED. IT IS THIS AVERAGE YIELD THAT IS USED IN THE CALCULATION OF NII ON

INVESTABLE FUNDS. YIELDS ARE UPDATED ANNUALLY. INVESTED ASSETS ARE ALLOCATED TO

SEGMENTS IN PROPORTION TO THE PRETAX ALLOCATION OF NII.

IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO APPLY THIS

METHODOLOGY TO HISTORICAL BUSINESSES AND, AS SUCH, ACTUAL (VERSUS ALLOCATED)

NII IS INCLUDED IN REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF THE RESTATED SEGMENTS FOR

PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE NOT

SIGNIFICANT TO A COMPARISON WITH THE NEW SEGMENT PRESENTATION. IT IS ALSO NOT

PRACTICABLE TO PRESENT TOTAL ASSETS FOR RESTATED COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY

SEGMENTS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER.

THE SPECIFIC BUSINESS

SEGMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

COMMERCIAL

THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT

OFFERS A BROAD ARRAY OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND INSURANCE-RELATED

THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT WAS

CREATED UPON THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC. IT COMBINED SPCS SPECIALTY OPERATIONS,

INCLUDING SPCS BOND AND CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS, WITH TPCS BOND AND

CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS, WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN TPCS COMMERCIAL SEGMENT PRIOR

TO THE MERGER. THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT PROVIDES A FULL RANGE OF STANDARD AND SPECIALIZED

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND THE COMPANYS PARTICIPATION IN LLOYDS.

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE

COMPANY SOLD ITS PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK BUSINESS, WHICH HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN

THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY

RETAINED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PRE-SALE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES RELATED TO THIS BUSINESS AND REMAINS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CHANGES IN

ESTIMATES IN THOSE RESERVES THROUGH A QUOTA-SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT. THE

IMPACT OF THIS TRANSACTION IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS ONGOING OPERATIONS.

PERSONAL WRITES VIRTUALLY

ALL TYPES OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COVERING PERSONAL RISKS. THE

MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER INSURERS.

AUTOMOBILE POLICIES PROVIDE

COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY TO OTHERS FOR BOTH BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE,

AND FOR PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO AN INSUREDS OWN VEHICLE FROM COLLISION AND VARIOUS

OTHER PERILS. IN ADDITION, MANY STATES REQUIRE POLICIES TO PROVIDE FIRST-PARTY

PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION, FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AS NO-FAULT COVERAGE.

HOMEOWNERS POLICIES ARE

AVAILABLE FOR DWELLINGS, CONDOMINIUMS, MOBILE HOMES AND RENTAL PROPERTY

CONTENTS. PROTECTION AGAINST LOSSES TO DWELLINGS AND CONTENTS FROM A WIDE

VARIETY OF PERILS IS INCLUDED IN THESE POLICIES, AS WELL AS COVERAGE FOR

CATASTROPHE

EXPOSURE

THE COMPANY HAS GEOGRAPHIC

EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. CATASTROPHES

CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL AND MAN-MADE EVENTS INCLUDING HURRICANES,

WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, EXPLOSIONS AND FIRES. THE

INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT

OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED

EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST

CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS; HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND

EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY

THOSE THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO REDUCE ITS

EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE.

THERE ARE RISKS WHICH IMPACT

THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION

OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY OF THE

COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE

COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY

UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE

RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER

DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND

POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF

DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND

BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A

CATASTROPHES OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN

ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR

THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS

ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

TERRORISM

RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 AND TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002,

THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 (THE TERRORISM ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO

FEDERAL LAW AND ESTABLISHED THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM),

A TEMPORARY FEDERAL PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THAT PROVIDED

FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR INSURED LOSSES RESULTING

FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN INTEREST.

THE PROGRAM WAS SCHEDULED TO TERMINATE ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. ON DECEMBER 22,

2005, THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005 (THE TERRORISM

EXTENSION ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW, REAUTHORIZING THE PROGRAM THROUGH DECEMBER 31,

2007, WHILE REDUCING THE FEDERAL ROLE UNDER THE PROGRAM. IN ORDER FOR A LOSS TO

BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN

AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS THAT VARY BY PROGRAM YEAR OF AMOUNTS $100

MILLION OR LESS, AND MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS AN ACT

OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM

EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION CERTAIN OF THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE.

FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE, PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY

INSURANCE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE, HEALTH OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD

INSURANCE, AND REINSURANCE. THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT EXEMPTED FROM COVERAGE

CERTAIN ADDITIONAL TYPES OF INSURANCE, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE,

PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY (OTHER THAN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS), SURETY, BURGLARY

AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS MULTI-PERIL. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY

CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE TERRORISM ACT

AND THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT. BOTH ACTS GENERALLY REQUIRE THAT ALL

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATE

IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE

REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR A PERCENTAGE OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER

AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP. THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT

PERCENTAGE REMAINS AT 90% FOR 2006, BUT DECREASES TO 85% IN 2007. IN EACH CASE,

THE DEDUCTIBLE IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE DEDUCTIBLE PERCENTAGE TO THE

INSURERS DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS FOR COVERED LINES FROM THE CALENDAR YEAR

IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE YEAR. THE DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM WAS

7% FOR 2003, 10% FOR 2004 AND 15% FOR 2005, AND WILL BE 17.5% FOR 2006 AND 20%

FOR 2007. THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS $1.91 BILLION

FOR 2006. THE ANNUAL CAP LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL

PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE

$100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL

REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE U.S. TREASURY AND AN INSURER THAT HAS MET ITS DEDUCTIBLE

FOR THE PROGRAM YEAR IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES (OR PORTION THEREOF) THAT

EXCEED THE $100 BILLION CAP. THE COMPANY HAD NO TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES IN

2005, 2004 OR 2003.

MERGER

ON APRIL 1, 2004, TPC

MERGED WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF SPC, AS A RESULT OF WHICH TPC BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. FOR ACCOUNTING

PURPOSES, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE ACQUISITION WITH TPC

TREATED AS THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIRER. ACCORDINGLY, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED

FOR AS A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION, USING TPCS HISTORICAL FINANCIAL

INFORMATION AND APPLYING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS OF SPC AS OF APRIL 1, 2004.

DETERMINATION

OF PURCHASE PRICE

THE STOCK PRICE USED IN

DETERMINING THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS BASED ON AN AVERAGE OF THE CLOSING PRICES OF

SPC COMMON STOCK FOR THE TWO TRADING DAYS BEFORE THROUGH THE TWO TRADING DAYS

AFTER SPC AND TPC ANNOUNCED THEIR MERGER AGREEMENT ON NOVEMBER 17, 2003.

THE PURCHASE PRICE ALSO INCLUDED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SPC STOCK OPTIONS, THE

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO SPCS PREFERRED STOCK, AND OTHER COSTS OF THE

TRANSACTION. THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS APPROXIMATELY $8.76 BILLION, AND WAS

CALCULATED AS FOLLOWS.

THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE

ACQUISITION WERE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A) TO CREATE A STRONGER COMPANY THAT

WOULD PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND TO CUSTOMERS ALIKE; B)

TO CAPITALIZE ON A COMMON STRATEGIC FOCUS ON DELIVERING THE HIGHEST VALUE TO

CUSTOMERS, AGENTS AND BROKERS AND, WORKING TOGETHER, TO EXPAND FUTURE

OPPORTUNITIES AND CAPTURE NEW EFFICIENCIES; AND C) TO STRENGTHEN THE COMBINED

COMPANYS POSITION AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

PRODUCTS.

AS CERTAIN PURCHASE ACCOUNTING AND TAX ADJUSTMENTS SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE

MERGER.

(6)

(7)

AN ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO SPCS

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AT

THE ACQUISITION DATE TO ESTIMATE THEIR FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT OF

$191 MILLION WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF NOMINAL CLAIM AND CLAIM

EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES (AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFORMITY

WITH THE ACQUIRERS ACCOUNTING POLICY ON DISCOUNTING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION

RESERVES), EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERNS, THE APRIL 1, 2004 U.S. TREASURY SPOT

RATE YIELD CURVE, A LEVERAGE RATIO ASSUMPTION (RESERVES TO STATUTORY SURPLUS),

AND A COST OF CAPITAL EXPRESSED AS A SPREAD OVER RISK-FREE RATES. THE METHOD

USED CALCULATES A RISK ADJUSTMENT TO A RISK-FREE DISCOUNTED RESERVE THAT WILL,

IF RESERVES RUN OFF AS EXPECTED, PRODUCE RESULTS THAT YIELD THE ASSUMED

COST-OF-CAPITAL ON THE CAPITAL SUPPORTING THE LOSS RESERVES. THE FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT IS REPORTED AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET, AND THE AMOUNTS MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACQUIRERS ACCOUNTING

POLICIES FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS PART OF THE CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE INTANGIBLE

ASSET WILL BE RECOGNIZED INTO INCOME OVER THE EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERN. BECAUSE

THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND THE RISK ADJUSTMENT (COST OF CAPITAL) COMPONENTS OF

THE INTANGIBLE ASSET RUN OFF AT DIFFERENT RATES, THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN

INCOME MAY BE A NET BENEFIT IN SOME PERIODS AND A NET EXPENSE IN OTHER

PERIODS.

(8)

THE MERGER-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE

WERE REMOVED FROM THE RESPECTIVE LINES OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AND ARE REPORTED ON A NET BASIS UNDER THE ABOVE CAPTION NET ASSETS OF

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. INCLUDED IN NET ASSETS OF

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

IN MARCH 2005, THE

COMPANY AND NUVEEN INVESTMENTS JOINTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMPANY WOULD

IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO DIVEST ITS 78% EQUITY INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS,

WHICH CONSTITUTED THE COMPANYS ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENT AND WAS ACQUIRED AS PART OF

THE MERGER ON APRIL 1, 2004. THE DIVESTITURE WAS COMPLETED THROUGH A SERIES OF

TRANSACTIONS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2005, RESULTING IN NET PRETAX

CASH PROCEEDS OF $2.40 BILLION.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THESE

TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF $345 MILLION

($224 MILLION AFTER-TAX) FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET OPERATING LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS OF $663 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005,

CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF $710 MILLION OF TAX EXPENSE WHICH RESULTED FROM THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS AND THE GAAP CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENT IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET INCOME FOR 2005.

THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

RELATED TO NUVEEN INVESTMENTS WERE REMOVED FROM THE RESPECTIVE LINES OF THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND REPORTED UNDER THE CAPTION NET ASSETS

OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31,

2004. THE CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES GENERATED BY THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE COMPANYS TAX BASIS AND THE GAAP BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS PART OF

THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE NET

ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LINE ITEM OF THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY HAS

SEPARATELY DISCLOSED THE OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING CASH FLOWS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO ITS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (NUVEEN INVESTMENTS), WHICH IN PRIOR

QUARTERS WERE REPORTED AS COMPONENTS OF CASH FLOWS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

THE CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

HAS BEEN REVISED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE 2005 PRESENTATION.

IMPAIRMENTS

FIXED

MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES

AN INVESTMENT IN A FIXED

MATURITY OR EQUITY SECURITY WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR SALE IS IMPAIRED IF ITS FAIR

VALUE FALLS BELOW ITS BOOK VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS CONSIDERED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER A DECLINE IS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR

VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF

THE ISSUER, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY.

ADDITIONALLY, FOR CERTAIN

SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS (INCLUDING

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), FASB EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) 99-20,

RECOGNITION OF INTEREST INCOME AND IMPAIRMENT ON

PURCHASED AND RETAINED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS,

REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PERIODICALLY UPDATE ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS

OVER THE LIFE OF THE SECURITY. IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF

ITS SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND THERE HAS

BEEN A DECREASE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS SINCE THE LAST

REVISED ESTIMATE, CONSIDERING BOTH TIMING AND AMOUNT, THEN AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED.

A FIXED MATURITY SECURITY IS

IMPAIRED IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SECURITYS CONTRACTUAL TERMS. EQUITY SECURITIES ARE

IMPAIRED WHEN IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOVER ITS COST

OVER THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD. FURTHER, FOR SECURITIES EXPECTED TO BE SOLD,

AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY TO RECOVER PRIOR TO THE EXPECTED DATE OF

SALE.

THE COMPANYS PROCESS FOR

REVIEWING INVESTED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENTS DURING ANY QUARTER INCLUDES THE

FOLLOWING.



IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

WHICH HAVE POSSIBLE INDICATIONS OF IMPAIRMENT;



ANALYSIS OF INVESTMENTS WITH GROSS UNREALIZED

INVESTMENT LOSSES THAT HAVE FAIR VALUES LESS THAN 80% OF AMORTIZED COST DURING

SUCCESSIVE QUARTERLY PERIODS OVER A ROLLING ONE-YEAR PERIOD;



REVIEW OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS BASED ON THE INVESTEES

CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, NEAR-TERM RECOVERY PROSPECTS AND OTHER

FACTORS, AS WELL AS CONSIDERATION OF OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT WERE NOT

RECOMMENDED FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS;



CONSIDERATION OF EVIDENTIAL MATTER, INCLUDING

AN EVALUATION OF FACTORS OR TRIGGERS THAT WOULD OR COULD CAUSE INDIVIDUAL

INVESTMENTS TO QUALIFY AS HAVING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS AND THOSE

THAT WOULD NOT SUPPORT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT; AND



DETERMINATION OF THE STATUS OF EACH ANALYZED

INVESTMENT AS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY OR NOT, WITH DOCUMENTATION OF THE RATIONALE

FOR THE DECISION.

REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENTS

THE CARRYING VALUES OF REAL

ESTATE PROPERTIES ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

THE REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL ESTATE

PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY.

VENTURE

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY NON-PUBLICLY TRADED

INSTRUMENTS IN EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES AND, HISTORICALLY, HAVING A HOLDING PERIOD

OF FOUR TO SEVEN YEARS. THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN MADE IN THE

HEALTH CARE, SOFTWARE AND COMPUTER SERVICES, AND NETWORKING AND INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGIES INFRASTRUCTURES INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY IS INVOLVED WITH

VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES EARLY IN THEIR FORMATION, AS THEY ARE DEVELOPING AND

DETERMINING THE VIABILITY OF, AND MARKET DEMAND FOR, THEIR PRODUCT. GENERALLY,

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE VENTURE

138

CAPITAL COMPANIES TO RECORD

REVENUES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT, WHICH CAN OFTEN TAKE THREE

TO FOUR YEARS, AND DOES NOT GENERALLY EXPECT THEM TO BECOME PROFITABLE FOR AN

EVEN LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS VALUATION OF SUCH

NON-PUBLICLY TRADED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS,

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AS WELL AS AN INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE REVIEW AND

CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS IMPAIRMENT.

FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



THE ISSUERS MOST RECENT FINANCING EVENTS;



AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER FUNDAMENTAL

DETERIORATION HAS OCCURRED;



WHETHER OR NOT THE ISSUERS PROGRESS HAS BEEN

SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN EXPECTED;



WHETHER OR NOT THE VALUATIONS HAVE DECLINED

SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE ENTITYS MARKET SECTOR;



WHETHER OR NOT THE INTERNAL VALUATION

COMMITTEE BELIEVES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ISSUER WILL NEED FINANCING WITHIN

SIX MONTHS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN OUR CARRYING VALUE; AND



WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY

AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR

RECOVERY, ENABLING IT TO RECEIVE VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN OUR COST.

THE QUARTERLY VALUATION

PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ONGOING

RESPONSIBILITY TO FREQUENTLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THOSE INVESTED

ASSETS, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EVENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO

IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS.

NON-PUBLICLY

TRADED INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO INCLUDES NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED

PARTNERSHIPS, AND CERTAIN FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. CERTAIN VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR

JOINT VENTURES, LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY SECURITIES.

CERTAIN OTHER PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS, ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (FAS) NO. 115,

ACCOUNTING

FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES,

BUT ARE

REPORTED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 60,

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY INSURANCE ENTERPRISES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE

DETERMINED BY AN INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE FOR SECURITIES FOR WHICH THERE IS

NO PUBLIC MARKET. THE INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE REVIEWS SUCH FACTORS AS

RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH, AND OTHER

BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTAL STATISTICS IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUES OF

SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS. OTHER NON-PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON

FACTORS SUCH AS MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, RECENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER

MARKET DATA. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF, BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS

AND CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER

ALL OF THE COST OF AN INDIVIDUAL HOLDING.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) WAS

COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 128,

EARNINGS PER SHARE

(FAS 128).

BASIC EPS WAS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. THE

COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EPS REFLECTED THE EFFECT OF POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE

SECURITIES.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER

OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING APPLICABLE TO BASIC AND DILUTED EPS FOR ALL

PERIODS PRIOR TO APRIL 1, 2004 WERE RESTATED TO REFLECT THE EXCHANGE OF

EACH SHARE OF TPC COMMON STOCK FOR 0.4334 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY

IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF FASB EITF 04-8,

THE

EFFECT OF CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE,

WHICH PROVIDED NEW GUIDANCE ON THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS ONE DEBT INSTRUMENT OUTSTANDING TO WHICH THE

NEW GUIDANCE APPLIED  ITS $893 MILLION, 4.50% CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

NOTES CONVERTIBLE INTO 16.7 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2004 EXCLUDED THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EFFECTS OF THESE NOTES AS THE IMPACT WOULD

HAVE BEEN ANTI-DILUTIVE. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE

APPLICATION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE RESULTED IN THE RESTATEMENT OF DILUTED INCOME

FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PER SHARE FROM THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED $3.88 TO

$3.80.

REINSURANCE

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF ASSUMED AND CEDED REINSURANCE

TRANSACTIONS. ASSUMED REINSURANCE REFERS TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN INSURANCE

RISKS THAT OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN. CEDED REINSURANCE

INVOLVES TRANSFERRING CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS (ALONG WITH THE RELATED WRITTEN

AND EARNED PREMIUMS) THE COMPANY HAS UNDERWRITTEN TO OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES

WHO AGREE TO SHARE THESE RISKS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF CEDED REINSURANCE IS TO

PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT IT IS

PREPARED TO ACCEPT. REINSURANCE IS PLACED ON BOTH A QUOTA-SHARE AND EXCESS OF

LOSS BASIS. CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT DISCHARGE THE COMPANY AS THE

PRIMARY INSURER, EXCEPT FOR CASES INVOLVING A NOVATION.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND

MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE

ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER

INSOLVENCIES. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY BECOME

INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD

RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO

DETERMINE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND STRATEGIES TO MANAGE

REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO REQUIRED

TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS THROUGH ASSUMED

REINSURANCE, PRINCIPALLY WITH REGARD TO RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS IN WORKERS

COMPENSATION. THE COMPANY PROVIDES SERVICES FOR SEVERAL OF THESE INVOLUNTARY

ARRANGEMENTS (MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS) UNDER WHICH IT WRITES SUCH

RESIDUAL MARKET BUSINESS DIRECTLY, THEN CEDES 100% OF THIS BUSINESS TO THE

MANDATORY POOL. SUCH SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ARRANGED TO PROTECT THE COMPANY

FROM ANY CREDIT RISK, AS ANY CEDED BALANCES ARE JOINTLY BACKED BY ALL THE POOL

MEMBERS.

THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ONGOING

REVIEW OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION PERIODS, CHANGES IN

REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND OTHER

RELEVANT FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS AN

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES. AMOUNTS DEEMED TO BE

UNCOLLECTIBLE, INCLUDING AMOUNTS DUE FROM KNOWN INSOLVENT REINSURERS, ARE

WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES. ANY SUBSEQUENT COLLECTIONS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF ARE

REPORTED AS PART OF UNDERWRITING RESULTS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED

UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES WAS $804 MILLION AND $751 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 AND DECEMBER 31, 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY ASSUMED 100% OF

THE WORKERS COMPENSATION PREMIUMS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN BY THE ACCIDENT

DEPARTMENT OF ITS FORMER AFFILIATE, THE TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY (TIC).

CERTAIN OF THE ASSUMED

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS THAT THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO WITH NON-AFFILIATED

COMPANIES ON AN EXCESS OF LOSS BASIS DO NOT TRANSFER INSURANCE RISK. THESE CONTRACTS

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTING AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND TOTALED $346 MILLION AND $405

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERED INTO A NEW REINSURANCE AGREEMENT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1,

2004, THAT PROVIDES $300 MILLION AGGREGATE COVERAGE FOR THE 2000 ACCIDENT YEAR

EXPOSURES WRITTEN BY SPC. BECAUSE THE NEW AGREEMENT IS FOR EVENTS OCCURRING

PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT, THE RESULTING $59 MILLION GAIN

WAS DEFERRED AND WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS AMOUNTS ARE RECOVERED FROM

THE REINSURER. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NET

WERE $5.85 BILLION.

GROSS CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 INCREASED $2.02 BILLION

OVER YEAR-END 2004 AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE

LOSSES INCURRED IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2005, AND AN INCREASE TO

ASBESTOS RESERVES PURSUANT TO THE COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REVIEW OF

ASBESTOS RESERVES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, BOTH OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE

DETAIL IN THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS. THOSE INCREASES IN RESERVES WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY CLAIM AND CLAIM EXPENSE PAYMENTS FROM RUNOFF OPERATIONS AND OTHER NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL AND

PERSONAL SEGMENTS.

GROSS CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 INCREASED BY $24.51

BILLION OVER YEAR-END 2003, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER WITH SPC AND

RESERVE CHARGES RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER. OF THE INCREASE IN 2004,

$19.50 BILLION RESULTED FROM THE ADDITION OF THE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS, AND $2.40

BILLION WAS DUE TO ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS

ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE DISCUSSION

THAT FOLLOWS.

THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS

TO THE ACQUIRED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES AS OF APRIL 1, 2004, THE MERGER DATE, ARE REPORTED AS

THE ACQUIRED RESERVES. SEE NOTE 2.

PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT

IN 2005, ESTIMATED CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS TOTALED A NET

$260 MILLION, INCLUDING $325 MILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IMPACTING THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WHICH EXCLUDES $59

MILLION OF ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT. IN 2005, ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS INCLUDED $30 MILLION OF

NET FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON COMMERCIAL LOSS SENSITIVE POLICIES IN VARIOUS

LINES; HOWEVER, SINCE THE BUSINESS TO WHICH IT RELATES WAS SUBJECT TO PREMIUM

ADJUSTMENTS, THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT,

NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 WAS $694 MILLION,

INCLUDING $830 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES AND $30 MILLION TO

STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE

FOLLOWING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES SECTION. THE REMAINING NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $166 MILLION WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER

THAN EXPECTED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY FOR BOTH CASUALTY AND PROPERTY-RELATED

LINES OF BUSINESS IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RESERVE

STRENGTHENING FOR ASSUMED REINSURANCE, WHICH IS IN RUNOFF.

THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT

RECORDED NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $9 MILLION IN 2005,

DRIVEN BY LOWER THAN EXPECTED SEVERITY FOR PROPERTY-RELATED EXPOSURES.

IN THE PERSONAL SEGMENT, NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 TOTALED $360 MILLION, DRIVEN

BY LOWER THAN EXPECTED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE

OF BUSINESS, AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN THE FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE

HOMEOWNERS LOSSES.

IN 2004, ESTIMATED CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS TOTALED A NET

$2.40 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.39 BILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IMPACTING THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING $75

MILLION OF ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT INCLUDED $928 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES, RESERVE

ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER OF $500 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION AND $300

MILLION FOR SURETY, $290 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, $252

MILLION RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, $113 MILLION RELATED TO

THE COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER, AND OTHER NET RESERVING

ACTIONS.

PRIMARILY ALL OF THE

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARGES IN 2004 WERE RECORDED IN THE COMMERCIAL

SEGMENT AND ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES SECTION. ALSO INCLUDED IN NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT IN 2004 WAS $38 MILLION RELATED

TO THE COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER ALONG WITH A STRENGTHENING

OF GULF RESERVES, WHICH WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY OTHER FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN CORE COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS DUE TO LOWER THAN EXPECTED

FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED LOSSES.

THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT

RECORDED PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $1.43 BILLION IN 2004, WHICH

INCLUDED THE CHARGES TO STRENGTHEN CONSTRUCTION AND SURETY RESERVES REFERRED TO

PREVIOUSLY, AS WELL AS THE $252 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO A SPECIFIC

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR AND $75 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMMUTATION OF

AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER. RESULTS IN 2004 ALSO REFLECTED $150 MILLION

OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN TPCS

CONSTRUCTION OPERATION PRIOR TO THE MERGER, OTHER RESERVE INCREASES, AND A

CHARGE TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DUE FROM A CO-SURETY ON

A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR CLAIM.

IN THE PERSONAL SEGMENT, NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2004 WAS $378 MILLION, DRIVEN BY

LOWER THAN EXPECTED FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE HOMEOWNERS LOSSES, AS WELL AS

A REDUCTION IN THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF

BUSINESS.

IN 2003, NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDED IN ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TOTALED $390 MILLION. THAT AMOUNT INCLUDED $549 MILLION OF

NET UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IMPACTING THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT

PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM $521 MILLION OF RESERVE STRENGTHENING AT GULF INSURANCE

COMPANY, A SUBSIDIARY THAT WROTE SPECIALTY INSURANCE PRIOR TO BEING PLACED IN

RUNOFF IN 2004. THE NET 2003 TOTAL ALSO INCLUDED UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT

RELATED TO AMERICAN EQUITY, AN OPERATION THAT WAS PLACED IN RUN-OFF IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

147

THOSE CHARGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET FAVORABLE

DEVELOPMENT IN OTHER COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES, PRINCIPALLY PROPERTY COVERAGES, IN

WHICH THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED LOWER NON-CATASTROPHE-RELATED CLAIM FREQUENCY. IN

2003, ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN

PRIOR YEARS INCLUDED $42 MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON

COMMERCIAL LOSS SENSITIVE POLICIES IN VARIOUS LINES; HOWEVER, SINCE THE

BUSINESS TO WHICH IT RELATES WAS SUBJECT TO PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, THERE WAS NO

IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, PERSONAL RECORDED $162 MILLION IN NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2003 PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LOWER THAN

EXPECTED NON-CATASTROPHE CLAIM FREQUENCY IN BOTH HOMEOWNERS AND NON-BODILY

INJURY AUTOMOBILE BUSINESSES, AND A $50 MILLION REDUCTION IN RESERVES HELD

RELATED TO THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.

FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004

AND 2003, CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS BETWEEN ACCIDENT YEARS OF LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES, PURSUANT TO REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, ARE INCLUDED IN CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS AND DID NOT

IMPACT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, THE COMPANYS CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INCLUDED $4.79 BILLION AND $4.57 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS, NET OF

REINSURANCE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS

AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS DUE TO THE VAGARIES OF COURT COVERAGE

DECISIONS, PLAINTIFFS EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, THE RISKS INHERENT IN

COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE

WHICH ARE SET FORTH BELOW.

ASBESTOS RESERVES.

BECAUSE EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE

COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE ASBESTOS EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER

ON A POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS. IN THE COURSE OF THIS REVIEW, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING

THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE

POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF EACH POLICYHOLDERS

POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE

CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT VALUES

OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER

INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS

CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR

DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN

ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE

LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM. WHEN AN ESTIMATE OF

THE GROSS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR INDEMNITY AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

IS DETERMINED FOR A POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY CALCULATES, BY EACH POLICY YEAR,

A CEDED REINSURANCE PROJECTION BASED ON ANY APPLICABLE FACULTATIVE AND TREATY

REINSURANCE, AS WELL AS PAST CEDED EXPERIENCE AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS.

CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES.

THE COMPANYS EVALUATIONS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN ANY DATA FROM WHICH A MEANINGFUL

AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY PAYMENT MAY BE DETERMINED.

WITH RESPECT TO ASBESTOS EXPOSURES, THE COMPANY ALSO

COMPARES ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE,

YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS

SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. NET ASBESTOS LOSSES AND EXPENSES PAID

IN 2005 WERE $399 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $301 MILLION IN 2004. THIS INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCLUSION OF THE SPC BUSINESS FOR THE FULL YEAR IN 2005

AND SUBSTANTIAL REINSURANCE RECOVERIES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004.

APPROXIMATELY 42% IN 2005 AND 22% IN 2004 OF TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES RELATE TO

POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANYS LIABILITY. THE LOWER PERCENTAGE EXPERIENCED

IN 2004 REFLECTED SUBSTANTIAL REINSURANCE BILLINGS DURING THE YEAR. IN 2005,

GROSS PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS TOTALED

$203 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $199 MILLION IN 2004.

THE $830 MILLION AND $928 MILLION ASBESTOS RESERVE

PROVISIONS IN 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, WERE RECORDED PURSUANT TO THE

COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL GROUND-UP ASBESTOS LIABILITY REVIEW IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH INCLUDED AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS

BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES,

148

JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. THE ASBESTOS

PROVISION IN 2005 RESULTED, IN PART, FROM HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE COSTS

DUE TO INCREASED TRIAL ACTIVITY FOR SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED PLAINTIFFS AND PROLONGED

LITIGATION BEFORE CASES ARE SETTLED OR DISMISSED. THE 2005 PROVISION ALSO

CONSIDERED THE JANUARY 2006 COURT DECISION VOIDING, ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS, THE

PREVIOUSLY RENDERED FAVORABLE ARBITRATION DECISION IN THE ONGOING ACANDS

LITIGATION (DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 17). THE ASBESTOS PROVISION

RECORDED IN 2004 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION COSTS AND

ACTIVITY SURROUNDING PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, ASBESTOS RESERVES, NET OF

REINSURANCE, WERE $4.36 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $3.93 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2004. THE COMPANY ACQUIRED $311 MILLION OF NET ASBESTOS RESERVES IN THE MERGER

WITH SPC IN 2004.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

IN ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE

PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY.

IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY,

AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF

SIMILAR EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY VARIABLES

PRESENTED, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT

EACH SITE; THE ALLEGATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF

SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE

NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE

NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND

GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP

BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR

EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF

OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE

NUMBER OF YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR

POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE

APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT

USED TO ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES. IN 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE

OF $30 MILLION, NET OF REINSURANCE, PRIMARILY FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT COSTS.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $290 MILLION, NET OF

REINSURANCE, TO INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES DUE TO REVISED ESTIMATES OF

COSTS RELATED TO RECENT SETTLEMENT INITIATIVES. NET ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES PAID

WERE $246 MILLION, $152 MILLION AND $155 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER

31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED

ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED

UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE

UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT

IS PRESENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE

SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP.

THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF

PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION

SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER

INCREASE OR DECREASE IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHICH CANNOT NOW BE

ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS

ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE

AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH

THE COMPANYS PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF

DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE EXPERIENCE

HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF

OTHER INSURANCE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE

INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO

PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON

THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT

WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS

CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME OF LARGE COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR

COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT,

UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH

POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART

OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS RESERVES, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANNUAL

GROUND-UP REVIEW OF ASBESTOS POLICYHOLDERS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE

IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE

FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR

A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN

INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

5.01% SENIOR NOTES



IN JULY 2002, CONCURRENT WITH THE ISSUANCE OF 17.8 MILLION OF SPC COMMON SHARES

IN A PUBLIC OFFERING, SPC ISSUED 8.9 MILLION EQUITY UNITS, EACH HAVING A STATED

AMOUNT OF $50, FOR GROSS CONSIDERATION OF $442 MILLION. EACH EQUITY UNIT

INITIALLY CONSISTED OF A FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACT FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON

STOCK, WHICH MATURED IN AUGUST 2005, AND AN UNSECURED $50 SENIOR NOTE OF THE

COMPANY (MATURING IN 2007). TOTAL ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE EQUITY UNITS WERE

AT THE RATE OF 9.00%, CONSISTING OF INTEREST ON THE NOTE AT A RATE OF 5.25% AND

FEE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FORWARD CONTRACT OF 3.75%. HOLDERS OF THE EQUITY UNITS

HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A REQUIRED REMARKETING OF THE SENIOR NOTE

COMPONENT. THE INITIAL REMARKETING DATE WAS MAY 11, 2005. ON THAT DATE, THE

NOTES WERE SUCCESSFULLY REMARKETED, AND THE INTEREST RATE ON THE NOTES WAS

RESET TO 5.01%, FROM 5.25%, EFFECTIVE MAY 16, 2005. THE REMARKETED NOTES MATURE

ON AUGUST 16, 2007. THE FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACT REQUIRED THE INVESTOR TO

PURCHASE, FOR $50, A VARIABLE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON

THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF AUGUST 16, 2005. THE NUMBER OF SHARES PURCHASED WAS

DETERMINED BASED ON A FORMULA THAT CONSIDERED THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON EACH OF 20 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS ENDING ON THE THIRD

TRADING DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE SETTLEMENT DATE, IN RELATION TO THE

$24.20 PER SHARE PRICE OF COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING. ON THE

BE REDEEMED; OR THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED

PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED

(EXCLUSIVE OF INTEREST ACCRUED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION) DISCOUNTED TO THE

DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMIANNUAL BASIS AT THE THEN CURRENT TREASURY RATE PLUS

AT ANY TIME ON OR PRIOR TO MATURITY, UNLESS PREVIOUSLY REDEEMED BY THE COMPANY,

INTO COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY AT A CONVERSION RATE OF 16.6433 SHARES FOR

INITIATED THE EXCHANGE OFFER PURSUANT TO A FORM S-4 THAT WAS FILED WITH THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. ACCORDINGLY, EACH SERIES OF EXCHANGE NOTES

HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, AND THE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND

REGISTRATION RIGHTS RELATING TO THE RESTRICTED NOTES DO NOT APPLY TO THE

EXCHANGE NOTES. AS OF MAY 13, 2003 (THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER),

99.8%, 99.4% AND 100% OF THE COMPANYS 5, 10, AND 30-YEAR RESTRICTED NOTES,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE EXCHANGED FOR EXCHANGE NOTES.

4.50% CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED NOTES

IN MARCH 2002, THE COMPANY ISSUED $893

MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.5% CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

NOTES, WHICH WILL MATURE ON APRIL 15, 2032, UNLESS EARLIER REDEEMED,

REPURCHASED OR CONVERTED. INTEREST IS PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS. THE COMPANY

HAS THE OPTION TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE NOTES FOR A PERIOD NOT

EXCEEDING 20 CONSECUTIVE INTEREST PERIODS NOR BEYOND THE MATURITY OF THE NOTES.

DURING A DEFERRAL PERIOD, THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST DUE TO HOLDERS OF THE NOTES

WILL CONTINUE TO ACCUMULATE, AND SUCH DEFERRED INTEREST PAYMENTS WILL

THEMSELVES ACCRUE INTEREST. DEFERRAL OF ANY INTEREST CAN CREATE CERTAIN

RESTRICTIONS FOR THE COMPANY. UNLESS PREVIOUSLY REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED, THE

NOTES ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDERS

AT ANY TIME AFTER MARCH 27, 2003 AND PRIOR TO APRIL 15, 2032 IF AT ANY TIME (1)

TRADING DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE CONVERSION DATE IS AT LEAST 20% ABOVE THE

THEN APPLICABLE CONVERSION PRICE ON THE CONVERSION DATE, (2) THE NOTES HAVE

BEEN CALLED FOR REDEMPTION, (3) SPECIFIED CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS HAVE OCCURRED,

OR (4) SPECIFIED CREDIT RATING EVENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTES HAVE OCCURRED.

THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION RATE

OF 0.4684 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR EACH $25.00 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES

(EQUIVALENT TO AN INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF $53.37 PER SHARE OF COMMON

STOCK), SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IN CERTAIN EVENTS. ON OR AFTER APRIL 18, 2007,

THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT THE COMPANYS OPTION. THE COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED

TO MAKE MANDATORY REDEMPTION OR SINKING FUND PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE

NOTES. THE NOTES ARE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND ARE SUBORDINATED IN

RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS. THE NOTES ARE

ALSO EFFECTIVELY SUBORDINATED TO ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER

LIABILITIES OF ANY OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT OR FUTURE SUBSIDIARIES.

MATURITIES

THE

AMOUNT OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OTHER THAN COMMERCIAL PAPER, THAT BECOME DUE IN

EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IS AS FOLLOWS: 2006, $210 MILLION; 2007, $1.02

BILLION; 2008, $552 MILLION; 2009, $143 MILLION; AND 2010, $273 MILLION.

LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN $800 MILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER

PROGRAM WITH BACK-UP LIQUIDITY CONSISTING OF A BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN JUNE

2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $1.0 BILLION, FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT

AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT

REPLACED AND CONSOLIDATED THE COMPANYS THREE PRIOR BANK CREDIT AGREEMENTS THAT

HAD COLLECTIVELY PROVIDED THE COMPANY ACCESS TO $1.0 BILLION OF BANK CREDIT

LINES. PURSUANT TO COVENANTS IN THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY MUST

MAINTAIN AN EXCESS OF CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OVER GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS OF NOT LESS THAN $10 BILLION AT ALL TIMES. THE COMPANY MUST ALSO

MAINTAIN A RATIO OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT TO THE SUM OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

DEBT PLUS CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OF NOT GREATER THAN 0.40 TO 1.00. IN ADDITION,

THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS OTHER CUSTOMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AS WELL AS

CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO A CHANGE IN

CONTROL. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE

COVENANTS AND ALL OTHER COVENANTS RELATED TO ITS RESPECTIVE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

OUTSTANDING. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS AN OPTION

TO INCREASE THE CREDIT AVAILABLE UNDER THE FACILITY, NO MORE THAN ONCE A YEAR,

UP TO A MAXIMUM FACILITY AMOUNT OF $1.5 BILLION, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF

A RATINGS REQUIREMENT AND CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS. THERE WAS NO AMOUNT

OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

SHELF REGISTRATION

IN DECEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE

POTENTIAL OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES. THE COMPANY MAY OFFER THESE

SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT

THE TIME OF OFFERING.

IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT ANY OF ITS DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS WILL NOT RESULT IN FUTURE TAX BENEFITS, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE MUST BE

ESTABLISHED FOR THE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE

REALIZED. THE NET CHANGE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WAS

A DECREASE OF $30 MILLION AND AN INCREASE OF $128 MILLION FOR DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, IN EACH YEAR RELATING TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS. BASED

PREDOMINANTLY UPON A REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS ANTICIPATED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME,

AND ALSO INCLUDING ALL OTHER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE,

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED.

FOR TAX RETURN PURPOSES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE

COMPANY HAD A NET OPERATION LOSS (NOL) CARRYFORWARD THAT EXPIRES, IF UNUSED, IN

2017-2018. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REALIZING THE BENEFIT OF NOL CARRYFORWARDS

DEPENDS ON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY TAX LAWS. THE

APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF THOSE NOLS ON A REGULAR TAX BASIS AND AN ALTERNATIVE

MINIMUM TAX (AMT) BASIS WERE $114 MILLION AND $81 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE

BENEFIT OF THE NOL CARRYFORWARD HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANYS INTERCOMPANY TAX SHARING AGREEMENT WAS

AMENDED TO INCLUDE THE SPC COMPANIES EFFECTIVE WITH THEIR ACQUISITION ON APRIL

1, 2004.

U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON $83

MILLION OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, AS SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED

IN THOSE OPERATIONS. FURTHERMORE, ANY TAXES PAID TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ON

THESE EARNINGS MAY BE USED AS CREDITS AGAINST THE U.S. TAX ON ANY DIVIDEND

DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SUCH EARNINGS.

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, CONGRESS ENACTED THE 

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT

 (AJCA), WHICH

PROVIDED A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS

PREVIOUSLY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO OBTAIN AN 85% DIVIDENDS

RECEIVED DEDUCTION. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED $158 MILLION OF

CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EARNINGS INVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, WHICH

RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2005. SEE NOTE 1.

TIGHI, IN 1996, FORMED STATUTORY SUBSIDIARY BUSINESS

TRUSTS UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WHICH ISSUED TRUST SECURITIES

REPRESENTING UNDIVIDED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE ASSETS OF THE TRUST. THE

GROSS PROCEEDS OF THE TRUST SECURITIES WERE INVESTED IN JUNIOR SUBORDINATED

DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES (JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES) OF ITS PARENT

(TPC). ON APRIL 9, 2003, TIGHI REDEEMED THE $900 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL OF

THE TIGHI 8.00% TO 8.08% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES HELD BY THE SUBSIDIARY

TRUSTS. THE SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS, IN TURN, USED THESE FUNDS TO REDEEM THE $900

MILLION LIQUIDATION VALUE OF THE TRUST SECURITIES.

PREFERRED STOCK

THE COMPANYS PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

REPRESENTS THE PAR VALUE OF PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING THAT THE COMPANY

ASSUMED IN THE MERGER RELATED TO THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. STOCK OWNERSHIP

PLAN (SOP) TRUST, LESS THE REMAINING PRINCIPAL BALANCE ON THE SOP TRUST DEBT.

THE SOP TRUST BORROWED FUNDS FROM A U.S. UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY TO FINANCE THE

PURCHASE OF THE PREFERRED SHARES, AND THE COMPANY GUARANTEED THE SOP DEBT. THE

FINAL PAYMENT ON THE SOP DEBT WAS MADE IN JANUARY 2005.

THE SOP TRUST MAY AT ANY TIME CONVERT ANY OR ALL OF

THE PREFERRED SHARES INTO SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT A RATE OF

EIGHT SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR EACH PREFERRED SHARE. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

HAS RESERVED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO SATISFY THE

CONVERSION OF ALL PREFERRED SHARES ISSUED TO THE SOP TRUST AND THE REDEMPTION

OF PREFERRED SHARES TO MEET EMPLOYEE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. UPON THE

REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES, THE COMPANY WILL ISSUE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

TO THE TRUST TO FULFILL THE REDEMPTION OBLIGATIONS. SEE NOTE 14.

HOLDERS OF PREFERRED STOCK HAVE A PREFERENCE UPON

LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP OF THE COMPANY OF $100 PER SHARE.

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE SOP WAS MERGED INTO THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN. SEE NOTE 14.

COMMON STOCK

ON APRIL 1, 2004, EACH ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARE OF

TPC CLASS A AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK (INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED PREFERRED STOCK

PURCHASE RIGHTS) WAS EXCHANGED FOR 0.4334 OF A SHARE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON

STOCK. SEE NOTE 2.

THE COMPANY IS GOVERNED BY THE MINNESOTA BUSINESS

CORPORATION ACT. ALL AUTHORIZED SHARES OF VOTING COMMON STOCK HAVE NO PAR

VALUE. SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REACQUIRED ARE CONSIDERED TREASURY SHARES. THE

NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF THE COMPANY IS 1.75 BILLION.

THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION ALLOW THE COMPANY TO

ISSUE FIVE MILLION UNDESIGNATED SHARES. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DESIGNATE

THE TYPE OF SHARES AND SET THE TERMS THEREOF. THE BOARD DESIGNATED 1,450,000

SHARES AS SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THE 401(K)

SAVINGS PLAN.

ON FEBRUARY 6, 2006, THE COMPANY, UNDER THE ST. PAUL

TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, ISSUED 2,401,032 COMMON STOCK

AWARDS IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARE

AWARDS TO PARTICIPATING OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. THE RESTRICTED STOCK

AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS, TOTALING 2,029,480 SHARES, GENERALLY VEST IN FULL

AFTER A TWO-YEAR OR THREE-YEAR PERIOD FROM DATE OF GRANT. THE PERFORMANCE SHARE

AWARDS, TOTALING 371,552 TARGET SHARES, REPRESENT SHARES WHICH THE RECIPIENT

MAY EARN UPON THE COMPANYS ATTAINMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE GOALS. THE

PERFORMANCE GOALS ARE BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ADJUSTED RETURN ON EQUITY OVER A

THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. IF PERFORMANCE FALLS SHORT OF TARGETED

PERFORMANCE NONE OR ONLY A PORTION OF THE SHARES WILL VEST AFTER THE THREE-YEAR

PERFORMANCE PERIOD FROM DATE OF GRANT. IF PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS TARGETED

PERFORMANCE, MORE THAN 100% (UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 160%) OF TARGET SHARES WILL

VEST AFTER THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD FROM DATE OF GRANT. THE FAIR VALUE

PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMMON STOCK AWARDS ON THE DATE OF GRANT WAS

$44.79. SEE NOTE 13.

156

TREASURY STOCK

ALL SHARES OF TPC COMMON STOCK THAT WERE HELD BY THE

COMPANY AS TREASURY STOCK AT THE MERGER DATE OF APRIL 1, 2004, WERE CANCELLED

AND RETIRED AS OF THAT DATE.

THE COMPANYS 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE LEGACY SPC 1994

STOCK INCENTIVES PLAN AND THE LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN PROVIDE SETTLEMENT

ALTERNATIVES TO EMPLOYEES IN WHICH THE COMPANY REPURCHASES SHARES TO COVER TAX

WITHHOLDING COSTS AND EXERCISE COSTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, THE

COMPANY HAD PURCHASED $47 MILLION AND $14 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ITS COMMON

STOCK UNDER THIS PLAN.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER, TPCS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED

A $500 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. DURING 2003, TPC REPURCHASED

APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION SHARES (AS ADJUSTED FOR THE MERGER) OF ITS COMMON

STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $40 MILLION. THAT REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS TERMINATED

UPON COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

COMMON SHARES ACQUIRED UNDER THESE PLANS ARE REPORTED

AS TREASURY STOCK IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS

AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. A MAXIMUM OF $2.56 BILLION IS AVAILABLE IN 2006 FOR

SUCH DIVIDENDS WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT

FOR CONNECTICUT-DOMICILED SUBSIDIARIES AND THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

FOR MINNESOTA-DOMICILED SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY RECEIVED $968 MILLION OF

DIVIDENDS FROM ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2005.

STATUTORY NET INCOME AND SURPLUS

STATUTORY NET INCOME OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES WAS $2.92 BILLION, $1.58 BILLION, AND $1.95 BILLION FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. STATUTORY CAPITAL AND

13. INCENTIVE PLANS

THE COMPANY, FOLLOWING THE MERGER, ADOPTED THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2004 INCENTIVE

PLAN) IN JULY 2004. THE PURPOSES OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN ARE TO REWARD THE

EFFORTS OF THE COMPANYS NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER

EMPLOYEES AND TO ATTRACT NEW PERSONNEL BY PROVIDING INCENTIVES IN THE FORM OF

STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN PERMITS GRANTS OF NONQUALIFIED

STOCK OPTIONS, INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED

STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK, STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED OR

STOCK-DENOMINATED AWARDS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THE NUMBER

OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZED FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2004

INCENTIVE PLAN IS 35 MILLION SHARES, SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT MAY BE

AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

158

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE

PLAN, THE LEGACY

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY

CORP. 2002 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

(LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN) AND

THE LEGACY

ST. PAUL GLOBAL STOCK OPTION PLAN

(LEGACY GLOBAL STOCK OPTION PLAN), WHICH CEASED GRANTING AWARDS

AFTER 2001, WERE TERMINATED. THE LEGACY

ST.

PAUL AMENDED AND RESTATED 1994 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

(LEGACY SPC 1994

STOCK PLAN) HAD EXPIRED ON MAY 4, 2004 BY ITS OWN TERMS, AND OTHER LEGACY SPC

STOCK PLANS HAD EITHER TERMINATED OR HAD NO SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANT.

THE LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN WAS THE ONLY PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH TPC

COULD MAKE STOCK-BASED AWARDS PRIOR TO THE MERGER. OUTSTANDING GRANTS WERE NOT

AFFECTED BY THE PLANS TERMINATION INCLUDING THE GRANT OF RELOAD OPTIONS

RELATED TO PRIOR OPTION GRANTS UNDER THE LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN AND THE

LEGACY SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN.

THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN IS THE ONLY PLAN PURSUANT TO

WHICH FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED. IN ADDITION TO THE 35 MILLION

SHARES INITIALLY AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE

FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE COUNTED TOWARDS THE 35 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE AND WILL

BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN: (I) SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO AN AWARD THAT EXPIRES UNEXERCISED, THAT IS FORFEITED,

TERMINATED OR CANCELED, THAT IS SETTLED IN CASH OR OTHER FORMS OF PROPERTY, OR

OTHERWISE DOES NOT RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, IN WHOLE

OR IN PART; (II) SHARES THAT ARE USED TO PAY THE EXERCISE PRICE OF STOCK

OPTIONS AND SHARES USED TO PAY WITHHOLDING TAXES ON AWARDS GENERALLY; AND (III)

SHARES PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ON THE OPEN MARKET USING CASH OPTION EXERCISE

PROCEEDS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR GRANT PURSUANT TO SUCH MARKET PURCHASES SHALL NOT BE

GREATER THAN THE NUMBER THAT COULD BE REPURCHASED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE

DATE OF EXERCISE OF THE STOCK OPTION GIVING RISE TO SUCH OPTION PROCEEDS.

EXCEPT FOR SHARES DELIVERED TO OR RETAINED IN THE

LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE WITHHOLDING OF TAXES

APPLICABLE TO THE EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS THAT HAVE RELOAD FEATURES,

THE PROVISIONS OF THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH THAT RESULT IN SHARES BECOMING

AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN ALSO APPLY TO ANY

AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE LEGACY SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN AND THE LEGACY TPC 2002

INCENTIVE PLAN THAT WERE OUTSTANDING ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 2004

INCENTIVE PLAN.

THE COMPANY, FOLLOWING THE MERGER, ALSO ADOPTED A

COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS (THE 2004 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

PROGRAM). UNDER THE 2004 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

COMPENSATION CONSISTS OF AN ANNUAL RETAINER, A DEFERRED STOCK AWARD AND A STOCK

OPTION AWARD. EACH NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR MAY CHOOSE TO RECEIVE ALL OR A PORTION

OF HIS OR HER ANNUAL RETAINER AND ANY COMMITTEE CHAIR OR CO-CHAIR FEES PAID IN

THE FORM OF CASH, COMMON STOCK OR DEFERRED STOCK. DEFERRED STOCK FOR THE ANNUAL

RETAINER, AND COMMITTEE CHAIR AND CO-CHAIR FEES, IS ELECTED PURSUANT TO THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS THAT THE

BOARD ADOPTED AFTER THE MERGER AND IS VESTED UPON GRANT. THE ANNUAL DEFERRED

STOCK AWARDS VEST ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF AWARD. ANY OF THE DEFERRED STOCK

AWARDS MAY ACCUMULATE UNTIL DISTRIBUTION AT A FUTURE DATE OR UPON TERMINATION

OF A DIRECTORS SERVICE. THE SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ISSUED UNDER

THE 2004 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM, INCLUDING SHARES OF DEFERRED STOCK, ARE

AWARDED UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN.

FIXED STOCK OPTION AWARDS

2004 INCENTIVE PLAN

THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED AN EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM UNDER

THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE STOCK OPTION

AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM,

STOCK OPTION AWARDS ARE GRANTED HAVING A TEN-YEAR TERM WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE

EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF

GRANT. THE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THIS PROGRAM THROUGH 2005 GENERALLY VEST

OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD, WITH 50% OF THE OPTION SHARES VESTING ON THE 2

ND

ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF GRANT, AND 25% OF THE OPTION SHARES VESTING ON EACH

AND 4

TH

ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE.

BEGINNING IN 2006, STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THIS PROGRAM WILL

GENERALLY VEST IN FULL AFTER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD FROM DATE OF GRANT. EXCEPT AS

THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD MAY ALLOW IN THE FUTURE, STOCK OPTIONS

CANNOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY THE PARTICIPANT.

159

LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN

ON APRIL 1, 2004, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MERGER

AGREEMENT, THE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF TPC COMMON STOCK

WERE CONVERTED INTO OPTIONS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THESE STOCK

OPTIONS RETAINED SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WERE

APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE CONVERSION. THE 0.4334 MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO WAS

APPLIED TO THE OUTSTANDING TPC STOCK OPTIONS TO REFLECT THIS CONVERSION.

THE TPC STOCK OPTIONS AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE LEGACY

TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN HAVE A TEN-YEAR TERM WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT (AS ADJUSTED

TO REFLECT THE MERGER). STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN PRIOR TO APRIL

27, 2004, GENERALLY VEST 20% EACH YEAR OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. STOCK OPTIONS

GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN FROM APRIL 27, 2004 UNTIL THE PLAN TERMINATION ON JULY

28, 2004, GENERALLY VEST OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD, WITH 50% OF THE OPTION SHARES

VESTING ON THE 2

ND

ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF GRANT, AND 25% OF THE

OPTION SHARES VESTING ON EACH OF THE 3

RD

AND 4

TH

ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE. PRIOR TO JANUARY 23, 2003, CERTAIN STOCK

OPTION AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN PERMITTED AN EMPLOYEE

EXERCISING AN OPTION TO BE GRANTED A NEW OPTION (A RELOAD OPTION) IN AN AMOUNT

EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE TPC COMMON STOCK USED TO SATISFY BOTH THE

EXERCISE PRICE AND WITHHOLDING TAXES DUE UPON EXERCISE OF AN OPTION. PRIOR TO

THE MERGER, THE RELOAD OPTIONS WERE GRANTED AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE

FAIR MARKET VALUE OF TPCS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT, AND AFTER THE

MERGER THE RELOAD OPTIONS WILL BE GRANTED AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE

FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE

RELOAD OPTIONS VEST SIX MONTHS AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE

REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED ORIGINAL OPTION.

LEGACY SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN AND

GLOBAL STOCK OPTION PLAN

ON APRIL 1, 2004, IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, THE

COMPANY ASSUMED 23 MILLION OUTSTANDING SPC STOCK OPTIONS, OF WHICH

APPROXIMATELY 4 MILLION REMAINED UNVESTED RELATED TO LEGACY SPC EQUITY-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS. THESE STOCK OPTIONS RETAINED THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS

THAT WERE APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE MERGER. UNDER THE SPC STOCK OPTION PROGRAMS,

STOCK OPTION AWARDS WERE GRANTED HAVING A TEN YEAR TERM WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE

EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT.

GENERALLY, OPTIONS VEST 25% EACH YEAR OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD. CERTAIN STOCK

NOVEMBER 10, 2003 PERMITTED AN EMPLOYEE EXERCISING AN OPTION TO BE GRANTED A

NEW OPTION (A RELOAD OPTION) IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT, VEST ONE YEAR

AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED

ORIGINAL OPTION.

STOCK OPTION FAIR VALUE INFORMATION

THE FAIR VALUE EFFECT OF STOCK OPTIONS IS DERIVED BY

APPLICATION OF A VARIATION OF THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL.

THE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ESTIMATING THE

FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT FOR ORIGINAL OPTIONS AND RELOAD OPTIONS

GRANTED IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003 AND FOR THE AWARDS ASSUMED ON APRIL 1, 2004 FROM

SPC AT THE MERGER WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE EXPECTED

VOLATILITY IS BASED ON THE AVERAGE VOLATILITY OF AN INDUSTRY PEER GROUP OF

ENTITIES BECAUSE THE COMPANY ONLY BECAME PUBLICLY TRADED IN MARCH 2002.

IN CONNECTION WITH SPC OPTIONS ASSUMED IN THE MERGER,

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ALL THE OUTSTANDING SPC STOCK OPTIONS AT APRIL 1,

2004 WAS $186 MILLION AND WAS INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE PURCHASE

PRICE BASED UPON THE ANNOUNCEMENT DATE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF SPC COMMON

STOCK, USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL. THE UNVESTED STOCK OPTION AWARDS REQUIRE

THE HOLDER TO RENDER SERVICE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD AND ARE THEREFORE

CONSIDERED UNEARNED COMPENSATION. AT APRIL 1, 2004, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES

OF THE UNVESTED AWARDS WERE $35 MILLION AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN UNEARNED

COMPENSATION AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF EQUITY. THE UNEARNED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE IS BEING RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO INCOME OVER THE REMAINING VESTING

PERIOD.

IN ADDITION, COMMERCIAL INSURANCE RESOURCES, INC.

(CIRI) HAD EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS IN WHICH AWARDS WERE GRANTED IN CIRIS

PRIVATELY HELD COMMON STOCK. IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANYS

PURCHASE OF THE MINORITY INTEREST OF CIRI IN 2004, THE COMPANY CONVERTED CIRIS

OUTSTANDING EQUITY-BASED AWARDS INTO AWARDS IN THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THE

CONVERTED AWARDS RETAINED THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WERE APPLICABLE

PRIOR TO THE CONVERSION. THE CONVERSION OF CIRI OUTSTANDING NONVESTED OPTIONS

INTO OPTIONS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK WAS CONSIDERED A

MODIFICATION AND THEREFORE THE MODIFICATION GUIDANCE OF FAS 123 WAS APPLIED TO

THE CONVERTED AWARDS. FOR THESE CONVERTED OPTIONS, THE EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE MODIFIED OPTIONS ISSUED OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL OPTIONS AT

THE DATE OF EXCHANGE WAS ADDED TO THE REMAINING UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST

OF THE ORIGINAL OPTION AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD.

UNDER FAS 123, RELOAD OPTIONS ARE TREATED AS SEPARATE

GRANTS FROM THE ORIGINAL GRANTS AND AS A RESULT ARE SEPARATELY VALUED WHEN

GRANTED. RELOAD OPTIONS ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED

ORIGINAL OPTION AND THEREFORE WOULD GENERALLY HAVE A SHORTER ESTIMATED LIFE.

SHARES RECEIVED THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES UNDER THE RELOAD PROGRAM ARE SUBJECT

TO RESTRICTION ON SALE. DISCOUNTS (AS MEASURED BY THE ESTIMATED COST OF

PROTECTION) HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF RELOAD OPTIONS GRANTED TO

REFLECT THESE SALES RESTRICTIONS.

RESTRICTED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK AND

PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD PROGRAMS

2004 INCENTIVE PLAN

THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE AWARDS OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND

DEFERRED STOCK TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES PURSUANT TO THE 2004

INCENTIVE PLAN. SUCH AWARDS INCLUDE RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS UNDER THE CAPITAL

ACCUMULATION PROGRAM (CAP) AND EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO

THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN. AWARDS ISSUED UNDER THE CAP PROGRAM ARE IN THE FORM OF

RESTRICTED STOCK AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES INCLUDED IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK

AWARD IS CALCULATED AT A 10% DISCOUNT FROM THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF THE

AWARD AND GENERALLY VEST IN FULL AFTER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT.

THE CAP PROGRAM HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF CAP AWARDS IN

FEBRUARY 2006. OTHER RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS ISSUED UNDER THE EQUITY AWARDS

PROGRAM GENERALLY VEST IN FULL AFTER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF

GRANT. EXCEPT UNDER LIMITED

162

CIRCUMSTANCES, DURING THIS PERIOD THE STOCK CANNOT BE

SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY THE PARTICIPANT, WHO IS REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE TO

THE COMPANY DURING THE RESTRICTED PERIOD. AWARDS GRANTED TO NON-U.S.

PARTICIPANTS ARE IN THE FORM OF DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS. THESE DEFERRED STOCK

AWARDS ARE GRANTED AT MARKET PRICE AND GENERALLY VEST AFTER THREE YEARS FROM

THE DATE OF GRANT AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME CONDITIONS AS THE RESTRICTED

STOCK AWARDS EXCEPT THAT THE SHARES ARE NOT ISSUED UNTIL THE VESTING CRITERIA

ARE SATISFIED.

ON OCTOBER 25, 2005, THE COMPANY APPROVED A

PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS PROGRAM PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN. UNDER THE

PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF

THE COMPANY WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF VICE PRESIDENT (OR ITS EQUIVALENT) OR ABOVE.

THE PERFORMANCE AWARDS REPRESENT TARGET SHARES THAT PROVIDE THE RECIPIENT THE

RIGHT TO EARN SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BASED UPON THE COMPANYS

ATTAINMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE GOALS. THE PROGRAM BECOMES EFFECTIVE

BEGINNING IN 2006. THE PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR PERFORMANCE AWARDS GRANTED IN 2006

ARE BASED ON THE COMPANYS ADJUSTED RETURN ON EQUITY OVER A THREE-YEAR

PERFORMANCE PERIOD. IF PERFORMANCE FALLS SHORT OF TARGETED PERFORMANCE, NONE OR

ONLY A PORTION OF THE SHARES WILL VEST AFTER THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD

FROM DATE OF GRANT. IF PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS TARGETED PERFORMANCE, MORE THAN 100%

(UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 160%) OF TARGET SHARES WILL VEST AFTER THE THREE-YEAR

PERFORMANCE PERIOD FROM DATE OF GRANT.

LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLANS

ON APRIL 1, 2004, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MERGER

AGREEMENT, THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS OF THE LEGACY

TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN WERE CONVERTED TO RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND DEFERRED

STOCK AWARDS IN THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND

DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS RETAINED SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT

WERE APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE CONVERSION. THE 0.4334 MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO WAS

APPLIED TO THE OUTSTANDING TPC RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND DEFERRED STOCK

AWARDS TO REFLECT THIS CONVERSION.

THE TPC RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE

LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN WERE AWARDED TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES

THROUGH TPCS CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROGRAM (TPC CAP). UNDER THIS PLAN, CERTAIN

TPC CAP PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED PART OF THEIR ANNUAL BONUS AWARDS IN RESTRICTED

STOCK, AND AT THEIR ELECTION, PART IN STOCK OPTIONS. THE NUMBER OF SHARES

INCLUDED IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD WAS CALCULATED AT A 25% DISCOUNT FROM

THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF THE AWARD AND GENERALLY VESTED IN FULL AFTER A

THREE-YEAR PERIOD. EXCEPT UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, DURING THIS PERIOD THE

STOCK CANNOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY THE PARTICIPANT, WHO IS REQUIRED TO

RENDER SERVICE TO THE COMPANY DURING THE RESTRICTED PERIOD. AWARDS GRANTED TO

NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS WERE IN THE FORM OF DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS. THESE DEFERRED

STOCK AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME CONDITIONS AS THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

EXCEPT THAT THE SHARES ARE NOT ISSUED UNTIL THE VESTING CRITERIA ARE SATISFIED.

LEGACY SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN

ON APRIL 1, 2004, IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, THE

COMPANY ASSUMED APPROXIMATELY 240,000 OF OUTSTANDING SPC RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

RELATED TO SPC EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

RETAINED THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WERE APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE

MERGER. UNDER THE SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN, THE AWARDS OF RESTRICTED STOCK WERE

SUBJECT TO COMPLETING A SPECIFIED OBJECTIVE OR PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT, GENERALLY

ONE TO FIVE YEARS. UNDER THE SPC CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PLAN, IMPLEMENTED IN

2002, THE NUMBER OF SHARES INCLUDED IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD IS CALCULATED

AT A 10% DISCOUNT FROM THE MARKET PRICE AT THE DATE OF THE AWARD AND GENERALLY

VESTS IN FULL AFTER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD. THE UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

REQUIRE THE HOLDER TO RENDER SERVICE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD AND ARE

THEREFORE CONSIDERED UNEARNED COMPENSATION. AT APRIL 1, 2004, THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF THE UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION WAS $9

MILLION AND HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN UNEARNED COMPENSATION AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT

OF EQUITY. THE UNEARNED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS BEING RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO

INCOME OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD.

OTHER INCENTIVE PLANS

IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANYS EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

PLANS DISCUSSED ABOVE, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS HAD AN EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN

IN WHICH AWARDS WERE GRANTED IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON

STOCK. THE AFTER-TAX COMPENSATION COST ASSOCIATED WITH THESE AWARDS INCLUDED IN

THE COMPANYS 2004 NET INCOME WAS APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION. THE COMPENSATION

COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUVEEN INVESTMENTS EQUITY-BASED PLAN WAS EXCLUDED

FROM THE COMPANYS RESULTS IN 2005 DUE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

(SEE NOTE 3).

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION USED TO DETERMINE THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION IS BASED ON THE MOODYS AA CORPORATE BOND INDEX ADJUSTED BY

25 BASIS POINTS TO REFLECT THE LONG DURATION NATURE OF THE PENSION OBLIGATION

AND ADJUSTED TO THE NEAREST QUARTER RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE IS THEN BACK-TESTED

BY COMPARISON TO A YIELD CURVE THAT REFLECTS THE HYPOTHETICAL PORTFOLIO OF HIGH

QUALITY BONDS (RATED AA OR HIGHER BY A RECOGNIZED RATING AGENCY) FOR WHICH THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH OUTFLOWS APPROXIMATES THE ESTIMATED PAYOUTS OF THE

PLAN.

IN CHOOSING THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN, THE

COMPANYS PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL RETURNS

OF EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME MARKETS IN CONJUNCTION WITH TODAYS ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

AS AN INDICATOR OF SENSITIVITY, INCREASING THE ASSUMED

HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE ACCUMULATED

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $47 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND THE

AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005. DECREASING

THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE

ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 BY $38

MILLION AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2005.

167

ON DECEMBER 8, 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG,

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (2003 MEDICARE ACT) WAS ENACTED. THE

2003 MEDICARE ACT INTRODUCES A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE PART D

AS WELL AS A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS

THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART

D. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS AVAILABLE UNDER

THE SPC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ARE ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART

D AND THUS QUALIFY FOR THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY UNDER THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT. THE

COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS THAT THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY WILL OFFSET OR REDUCE THE COMPANYS

SHARE OF THE COST OF THE UNDERLYING POSTRETIREMENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE

ON WHICH THE SUBSIDY IS BASED. AS A RESULT, THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE 2003

MEDICARE ACT WAS REFLECTED IN THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING REMEASUREMENT OF THE SPC

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ON APRIL 1, 2004. THE EFFECT OF THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS

A $29 MILLION REDUCTION (WITH NO TAX EFFECT) IN THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS OF APRIL 1, 2004 AND A REDUCTION OF $2 MILLION IN NET

PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. SEE

SAVINGS PLAN

THE COMPANY, IN SEPTEMBER 2005, MERGED THE TRAVELERS

401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. SAVINGS PLUS PLAN (SPP), AND

THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP) INTO ONE NEW PLAN, THE

ST. PAUL TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE SAVINGS PLAN). SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

COMPANY EMPLOYEES ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SAVINGS PLAN. IN 2005, THE

COMPANY MATCHED EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 5% OF ELIGIBLE PAY, WITH A MAXIMUM

ANNUAL MATCH OF $5,000 WHICH BECOMES 100% VESTED AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE.

THE MATCH IS PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK WHICH CAN BE

REINVESTED AT ANY TIME INTO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT OPTION. THE EXPENSE RELATED TO

THIS PLAN WAS $63 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005.

LEGACY TPC 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN

PRIOR TO THE SEPTEMBER 2005 PLAN MERGER, THE COMPANY

HAD A 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN UNDER WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL LEGACY TPC EMPLOYEES

AND COMPANY EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER APRIL 1, 2004, WERE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY MATCHED EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 5% OF ELIGIBLE PAY

BUT NOT MORE THAN $2,500 ANNUALLY. PRIOR TO 2004, THE COMPANY MATCHED EMPLOYEE

CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 3% OF ELIGIBLE PAY BUT NOT MORE THAN $1,500 ANNUALLY. THE

EXPENSE RELATED TO THIS PLAN WAS $34 MILLION AND $20 MILLION FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

169

LEGACY SPC 401(K) SAVINGS PLUS AND

STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

PRIOR TO THE SEPTEMBER 2005 PLAN MERGER AND IN

CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER WITH SPC, THE COMPANY ASSUMED THE ST. PAUL

COMPANIES, INC. SAVINGS PLUS PLAN (SPP), A 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN AND THE ST. PAUL

COMPANIES, INC. STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP). SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES WHO

WERE HIRED BY LEGACY SPC BEFORE APRIL 1, 2004 WERE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN

THESE PLANS. IN 2004 UNDER THE SPP, THE COMPANY MATCHED 100% OF EMPLOYEES

CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 6% OF THEIR SALARY. THE MATCH WAS IN THE FORM

OF PREFERRED SHARES, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE IN THE SOP, OR IN THE COMPANYS

COMMON SHARES. ALSO ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS WERE PREFERRED SHARES EQUAL TO

THE VALUE OF DIVIDENDS ON PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED SHARES.

TO FINANCE THE PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE FOR FUTURE

ALLOCATION TO QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, THE SOP BORROWED $150 MILLION AT 9.4% FROM A

PRIMARY U.S. UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY. AS THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OF THE

TRUSTS LOAN WAS PAID, A PRO RATA AMOUNT OF PREFERRED STOCK WAS RELEASED FOR

ALLOCATION TO PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES. EACH SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK PAYS A

DIVIDEND OF $11.72 ANNUALLY AND IS CURRENTLY CONVERTIBLE INTO EIGHT SHARES OF

THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS ON ALL SHARES HELD BY THE

TRUST WERE USED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE SOP OBLIGATION. IN ADDITION TO

DIVIDENDS PAID TO THE TRUST, ADDITIONAL CASH CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MADE TO THE SOP

AS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET THE SOPS DEBT OBLIGATION. THE SOPS DEBT

OBLIGATION WAS PAID OFF IN JANUARY 2005 WITH A FINAL PAYMENT OF $5 MILLION;

CONSEQUENTLY, ALL PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS ARE NOW PAID TO PREFERRED

STOCKHOLDERS. THE SOP ALLOCATED THE FINAL 71,346 PREFERRED SHARES IN 2004. THE

SOP HAS NO PREFERRED SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE ALLOCATIONS.

ALL COMMON SHARES AND THE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENT OF

ALL PREFERRED SHARES HELD BY THE SOP ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR DILUTED EPS

COMPUTATIONS AND DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALL SHARES ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF

POSITION 76-3, ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP

PLANS, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS IN ACCOUNTING FOR THIS PLAN. THE COMPANY

RECORDED AN EXPENSE OF $5 MILLION IN 2004.

15.          LEASES

RENT EXPENSE WAS $219 MILLION, $207 MILLION AND $115

MILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

FUTURE MINIMUM ANNUAL RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER

NONCANCELLABLE OPERATING LEASES ARE $173 MILLION, $157 MILLION, $124 MILLION,

$87 MILLION, $52 MILLION AND $164 MILLION FOR 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 AND

2011 AND THEREAFTER, RESPECTIVELY. FUTURE SUBLEASE RENTAL INCOME AGGREGATING

APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION WILL PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE COMMITMENTS.

16.     DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE

COMPANY MAY USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE

SWAPS, EQUITY SWAPS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, OPTIONS, FINANCIAL FUTURES AND FORWARD

CONTRACTS, AS A MEANS OF HEDGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE, EQUITY PRICE CHANGE

AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HOLD OR

ISSUE DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

FOR

A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE, THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP MUST BE

DESIGNATED AND FORMALLY DOCUMENTED AT INCEPTION DETAILING THE PARTICULAR RISK

MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR THE HEDGE, WHICH INCLUDES THE ITEM AND

RISK THAT IS BEING HEDGED, THE DERIVATIVE THAT IS BEING USED, AS WELL AS HOW

EFFECTIVENESS IS BEING ASSESSED. A DERIVATIVE HAS TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN

ACCOMPLISHING THE OBJECTIVE OF OFFSETTING EITHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR CASH

FLOWS FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE HEDGING

RELATIONSHIPS IS EVALUATED ON A RETROSPECTIVE AND PROSPECTIVE BASIS USING

QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF CORRELATION. IF A HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS FOUND TO BE

INEFFECTIVE, IT NO LONGER QUALIFIES AS A HEDGE, AND ANY EXCESS GAINS OR LOSSES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH INEFFECTIVENESS AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE RECOGNITION

OF GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AND

QUALIFY AS A HEDGE DEPENDS UPON WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS A FAIR

VALUE HEDGE, A CASH FLOW HEDGE OR A FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE.

170

THE

COMPANY HAS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS IN

WHICH DERIVATIVES (FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS) HEDGE THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXPOSURE. THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE HEDGING THE NET INVESTMENT, INCLUDING ANY FORWARD PREMIUM OR

DISCOUNT, IS REFLECTED IN THE ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER

SOURCES AS PART OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, THE AMOUNT INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES WAS A $2 MILLION LOSS

AND A $4 MILLION LOSS, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2005, THE COMPANY INCURRED NET

REALIZED LOSSES OF LESS THAN $1 MILLION FROM HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS, AND IN

2004, THE COMPANY HAD NO NET REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES FROM HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVES

THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED OR DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE

WITH CHANGES IN VALUE REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE

COMPANY HAS CERTAIN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND

2004.

THE

COMPANY ENGAGED IN U.S. TREASURY NOTE FUTURES TRANSACTIONS TO MODIFY THE

DURATION OF SPECIFIC ASSETS WITHIN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY ENTERS

INTO 90-DAY FUTURES CONTRACTS ON 2-YEAR, 5-YEAR, 10-YEAR AND 30-YEAR U.S.

TREASURY NOTES WHICH REQUIRE A DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET SETTLEMENT WITH THE BROKER.

THE NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE OPEN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS WAS $1.20

BILLION AND $1.33 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND DECEMBER 31, 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AND DO NOT

QUALIFY AS HEDGES UNDER FAS 133 AND AS SUCH THE DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE ARE REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). NET

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) IN 2005 AND 2004 INCLUDED NET GAINS OF $13

MILLION AND NET LOSSES OF $44 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY

FUTURES CONTRACTS WHICH ARE SETTLED DAILY.

THE

COMPANY PURCHASES INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY

CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES. THESE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE WITH CHANGES IN VALUE REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS

(LOSSES). DERIVATIVES EMBEDDED IN CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES ARE REPORTED ON A

COMBINED BASIS WITH THEIR HOST INSTRUMENT AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS FIXED MATURITY

SECURITIES.

THE

COMPANY OWNS 6 MILLION STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS OF PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS, A

PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY. THESE WARRANTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AND DO NOT QUALIFY AS

HEDGES UNDER FAS 133 AND AS SUCH THE MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE

REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES).

171

DURING

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY TERMINATED ITS INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

WHICH HAD BEEN ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER. THE NOTIONAL VALUE OF THESE SWAPS WAS

$730 MILLION AT THE TIME OF THE TERMINATION. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS WERE USED TO MANAGE EXPOSURE OF CERTAIN OF ITS FIXED RATE DEBT TO

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DID NOT QUALIFY FOR

CONTINUED HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOLLOWING THE MERGER AND, AS SUCH, THE

MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WERE REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT

GAINS AND LOSSES PRIOR TO THE TERMINATION OF THESE AGREEMENTS.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE

COMPANY USES VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS

BUSINESS. CERTAIN INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE EXCLUDED BY FAS 107,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

,

AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNTS DISCUSSED.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITIES HAD A FAIR VALUE,

WHICH EQUALED CARRYING VALUE, OF $58.98 BILLION AND $54.26 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITIES FOR WHICH A

QUOTED MARKET PRICE OR DEALER QUOTE ARE NOT AVAILABLE WAS $456 MILLION AND $574

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 1.

THE

CARRYING VALUES OF CASH, SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, MORTGAGE LOANS, INVESTMENT

INCOME ACCRUED, AND PAYABLES FOR SECURITIES LENDING AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

APPROXIMATED THEIR FAIR VALUES. SEE NOTES 1 AND 6.

THE

CARRYING VALUES OF $1.11 BILLION AND $1.14 BILLION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS APPROXIMATED THEIR FAIR VALUES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE CARRYING VALUES OF $5.33 BILLION AND $4.83 BILLION

OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, ALSO APPROXIMATED THEIR FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS

DETERMINED USING VARIOUS METHODS INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AS

APPROPRIATE FOR THE VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE

CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 WAS

$5.85 BILLION AND $5.82 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESPECTIVE TOTALS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 WERE $6.31 BILLION AND $6.30 BILLION.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER INCLUDED IN DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 AND 2004 APPROXIMATED ITS BOOK VALUE BECAUSE OF ITS SHORT-TERM NATURE. FOR

OTHER DEBT, THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE WAS BASED UPON THE BID PRICE AT DECEMBER

31, 2005 AND 2004.

172

17.     CONTINGENCIES,

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

CONTINGENCIES

THE

FOLLOWING SECTION DESCRIBES THE MAJOR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY

ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS, TO WHICH THE COMPANY OR ANY OF

ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS A PARTY OR TO WHICH ANY OF THE COMPANYS PROPERTY IS

SUBJECT.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED PROCEEDINGS

IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY RECEIVES CLAIMS FOR

INSURANCE ARISING UNDER POLICIES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY ASSERTING ALLEGED

INJURIES AND DAMAGES FROM ASBESTOS, HAZARDOUS WASTE AND OTHER TOXIC SUBSTANCES

WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

THE LITIGATION DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO

AGGRESSIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED LITIGATION. THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE RELATED LITIGATION CONTINUE TO CHANGE.

TPC

IS INVOLVED IN THREE SIGNIFICANT PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING A BANKRUPTCY

PROCEEDING) RELATING TO ACANDS, INC. (ACANDS), FORMERLY A NATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR

AND INSTALLER OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS. THE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE DISPUTES

AS TO WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT ANY OF ACANDS POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR

CURRENT OR FUTURE BODILY INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE

POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. THE STATUS OF THE VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS IS DESCRIBED

BELOW.

ACANDS

FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN SEPTEMBER 2002 (

IN

RE: ACANDS, INC.,

PENDING IN THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE

DISTRICT OF DELAWARE). IN ITS PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION, ACANDS SOUGHT TO

ESTABLISH A TRUST TO PAY ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST IT AND SOUGHT TO

ASSIGN TO THE TRUST ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. THE

PROPOSED PLAN AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FILED BY ACANDS CLAIMED THAT ACANDS HAD

SETTLED THE VAST MAJORITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS CURRENTLY

PENDING AGAINST IT FOR APPROXIMATELY $2.80 BILLION. ACANDS ASSERTS THAT, BASED

ON A PRIOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN TPC AND ACANDS AND ACANDS INTERPRETATION OF THE

JULY 31, 2003 ARBITRATION PANEL RULING DESCRIBED BELOW, TPC IS LIABLE FOR 45%

OF THE $2.80 BILLION. ON JANUARY 26, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ISSUED A

DECISION REJECTING CONFIRMATION OF ACANDS PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT FOUND, CONSISTENT WITH TPCS OBJECTIONS TO ACANDS PROPOSED

PLAN, THAT THE PROPOSED PLAN WAS NOT FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR, WAS NOT PROPOSED IN

GOOD FAITH AND DID NOT COMPLY WITH SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE.

ACANDS HAS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS DECISION AND HAS

FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF

LAW IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT. TPC HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE APPEAL

AND OBJECTIONS AND HAS ALSO FILED AN OPPOSITION TO ACANDS OBJECTIONS.

AN

ARBITRATION WAS COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2001 TO DETERMINE WHETHER AND TO WHAT

EXTENT ACANDS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR BODILY INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE

SUBJECT TO INSURANCE POLICY AGGREGATE LIMITS. ON JULY 31, 2003, THE ARBITRATION

PANEL RULED IN FAVOR OF TPC THAT ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST ACANDS

ARE SUBJECT TO THE AGGREGATE LIMITS OF THE POLICIES ISSUED TO ACANDS, WHICH

HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED. IN OCTOBER 2003, ACANDS COMMENCED A LAWSUIT SEEKING TO

VACATE THE ARBITRATION AWARD AS BEYOND THE PANELS SCOPE OF AUTHORITY (

ACANDS, INC. V. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.,

U.S.D.CT. E.D. PA.). ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED AN ORDER

DENYING ACANDS MOTION TO VACATE THE ARBITRATION AWARD. ON JANUARY 19, 2006,

THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT REVERSED THE DISTRICT

COURTS DECISION AND DECLARED THE ARBITRATION AWARD VOID ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS.

ON FEBRUARY 8, 2006, TPC FILED A MOTION TO STAY THE ISSUANCE OF THE THIRD CIRCUITS

MANDATE IN ANTICIPATION OF TPCS PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE

UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

IN

THE OTHER PROCEEDING, A RELATED CASE PENDING BEFORE THE SAME COURT AND

COMMENCED IN SEPTEMBER 2000 (

ACANDS V.

TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.

, U.S.D.CT., E.D. PA.), ACANDS

SOUGHT A DECLARATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS

AGAINST ACANDS ARE SUBJECT TO OCCURRENCE LIMITS UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED

BY TPC. TPC FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION BASED UPON THE JULY 31, 2003

ARBITRATION DECISION DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DISTRICT COURT FOUND THE DISPUTE WAS

MOOT AS A RESULT OF THE ARBITRATION PANELS DECISION. THE DISTRICT COURT,

THEREFORE, BASED ON THE ARBITRATION PANELS DECISION, DISMISSED THE CASE. IF THE

JANUARY 19, 2006 RULING OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT DESCRIBED IN THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE SURVIVES

FURTHER APPEAL, THIS CASE WILL BE REINSTATED.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IT HAS MERITORIOUS POSITIONS IN THESE

ACANDS-RELATED PROCEEDINGS AND INTENDS TO LITIGATE VIGOROUSLY.

173

IN OCTOBER 2001 AND APRIL 2002, TWO

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS (

WISE V.

TRAVELERS

AND

MENINGER V.

TRAVELERS

), WERE FILED AGAINST TPC AND OTHER INSURERS (NOT INCLUDING

SPC) IN STATE COURT IN WEST VIRGINIA. THESE CASES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY

CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE PROCEEDING IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY,

WEST VIRGINIA. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE INSURER DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN UNFAIR

TRADE PRACTICES BY INAPPROPRIATELY HANDLING AND SETTLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THE

PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO REOPEN LARGE NUMBERS OF SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND TO

IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, DIRECTLY ON INSURERS.

LAWSUITS SIMILAR TO

WISE

WERE

FILED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND HAWAII (THESE SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS

THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS). ALSO, IN

NOVEMBER

2001, PLAINTIFFS IN CONSOLIDATED ASBESTOS

ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE A MASS TORT PANEL OF JUDGES IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT

MOVED TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT TO NAME TPC AS A DEFENDANT, ALLEGING THAT TPC

AND OTHER INSURERS BREACHED ALLEGED DUTIES TO CERTAIN USERS OF ASBESTOS

PRODUCTS. IN MARCH 2002, THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION TO AMEND. PLAINTIFFS

SEEK DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF AND

RAISING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE PRESENTED IN THE WEST VIRGINIA AMENDED

COMPLAINT ARE ALSO PENDING IN OHIO STATE COURT AGAINST TPC AND SPC, IN TEXAS

STATE COURT AGAINST TPC AND SPC, AND IN LOUISIANA STATE COURT AGAINST TPC (THE

CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THESE SUITS, TOGETHER WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA SUIT, ARE

COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS).

ALL OF THE ACTIONS AGAINST TPC DESCRIBED IN THE

PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, OTHER THAN THE HAWAII ACTIONS, HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO A

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER ENTERED BY THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT IN NEW YORK

THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY PRESIDED OVER AND APPROVED THE REORGANIZATION IN BANKRUPTCY

OF TPCS FORMER POLICYHOLDER JOHNS-MANVILLE CORPORATION AND AFFILIATED

ENTITIES. IN AUGUST 2002, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT HELD A HEARING ON TPCS

MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION PROHIBITING FURTHER PROSECUTION OF THE

LAWSUITS PURSUANT TO THE REORGANIZATION PLAN AND RELATED ORDERS. AT THE

CONCLUSION OF THIS HEARING, THE COURT ORDERED THE PARTIES TO MEDIATION,

APPOINTED A MEDIATOR AND CONTINUED THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. DURING

2003, THE SAME BANKRUPTCY COURT EXTENDED THE EXISTING INJUNCTION TO APPLY TO AN

ADDITIONAL SET OF CASES FILED IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS IN TEXAS AND OHIO AS WELL

AS TO THE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE PROSECUTING THESE CASES. THE ORDER ALSO ENJOINED

THESE ATTORNEYS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE LAW FIRMS FROM COMMENCING ANY FURTHER

LAWSUITS AGAINST TPC BASED UPON THESE ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF

THE COURT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE INJUNCTION, ADDITIONAL COMMON LAW CLAIMS WERE

FILED AND SERVED ON TPC.

ON NOVEMBER 19, 2003, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT A SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS HAD BEEN

REACHED. THIS SETTLEMENT INCLUDES A LUMP SUM PAYMENT OF UP TO $412 MILLION BY

TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. AFTER CONTINUED MEETINGS

WITH THE MEDIATOR, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON MAY 25,

2004 THAT A SETTLEMENT RESOLVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PENDING AND SIMILAR FUTURE

COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC HAD ALSO BEEN REACHED. THIS SETTLEMENT REQUIRES A

PAYMENT OF UP TO $90 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

CONTINGENCIES. EACH OF THESE SETTLEMENTS IS CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, AN ORDER OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CLARIFYING THAT ALL OF THESE CLAIMS,

AND SIMILAR FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, ARE BARRED BY PRIOR

ORDERS ENTERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORIGINAL

JOHNS-MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.

ON AUGUST 17, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

ENTERED AN ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS AND CLARIFYING ITS PRIOR ORDERS THAT

ALL OF THE PENDING STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON

LAW CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST TPC ARE BARRED. THE ORDER ALSO APPLIES TO SIMILAR

DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

FOUR APPEALS WERE TAKEN FROM THE AUGUST 17,

2004 RULING. THESE APPEALS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED AND ARE CURRENTLY PENDING. THE

PARTIES HAVE COMPLETED BRIEFING ALL OF THE ISSUES AND A HEARING WAS HELD BEFORE

THE DISTRICT COURT ON FEBRUARY 22, 2006. THE COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION TO

PAY ANY OF THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS UNLESS AND UNTIL THE ORDERS AND RELIEF BECOME

FINAL AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY FURTHER APPELLATE REVIEW. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE

TO PREDICT HOW APPELLATE COURTS WILL RULE ON THE PENDING APPEALS.

174

SPC, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

RULINGS OR THE SETTLEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, HAS NUMEROUS DEFENSES IN ALL OF THE

DIRECT ACTION CASES ASSERTING COMMON LAW CLAIMS THAT ARE PENDING AGAINST IT. SPCS

DEFENSES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THESE NOVEL THEORIES HAVE NO BASIS IN LAW; THAT

THEY ARE DIRECTLY AT ODDS WITH THE WELL-ESTABLISHED LAW PERTAINING TO THE

INSURED/INSURER RELATIONSHIP; THAT THERE IS NO GENERALIZED DUTY TO WARN AS

ALLEGED BY THE PLAINTIFFS; AND THAT THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AS TO

MANY OF THESE CLAIMS HAS LONG SINCE EXPIRED. MANY OF THESE DEFENSES HAVE BEEN

RAISED IN INITIAL MOTIONS TO DISMISS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS. THERE

HAVE BEEN FAVORABLE RULINGS DURING 2003 AND 2004 IN TEXAS AND DURING 2004 AND

2005 IN OHIO ON SOME OF THESE MOTIONS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS THAT

DEALT WITH STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND THE VALIDITY OF THE ALLEGED CAUSES OF

ACTIONS. ON MAY 26, 2005, THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO, EIGHTH DISTRICT,

AFFIRMED THE EARLIEST OF THESE FAVORABLE RULINGS. IN TEXAS, ONLY ONE COURT, IN JUNE OF

2005, HAS DENIED THE INSURERS INITIAL CHALLENGES TO THE PLEADINGS. THAT RULING

WAS CONTRARY TO THE RULINGS BY OTHER COURTS IN SIMILAR CASES, AND SPC INTENDS

TO CONTINUE TO DEFEND THIS CASE VIGOROUSLY.

THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING ITS ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF THESE DISPUTES IS UNCERTAIN. IN

THIS REGARD, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE

RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE,

INCLUDING SETTLING LITIGATION UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR A DISCUSSION

OF OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPOSURE, SEE ITEM 2  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION, 

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND  UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT LEGAL

OUTCOMES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. ANY SUCH DEVELOPMENT WILL BE

AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN

APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES

MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY

CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF

EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT

CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

SHAREHOLDER

LITIGATION AND RELATED PROCEEDINGS

TPC AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WERE NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN THREE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY SHAREHOLDERS

ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC

AND SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS WELL AS UNSPECIFIED MONETARY DAMAGES.

THE ACTIONS WERE CAPTIONED

HENZEL, ET AL. V.

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., ET AL.

(JUD. DIST. OF WATERBURY,

CT. NOV. 17, 2003);

VOZZOLO V.

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., ET AL.

(JUD. DIST. OF WATERBURY,

CT. NOV. 17, 2003); AND

FARINA V.

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., ET AL.

(JUD. DIST. OF WATERBURY,

CT. DECEMBER 15, 2003).  THE

FARINA

COMPLAINT ALSO NAMED SPC AND ITS FORMER SUBSIDIARY, ADAMS

ACQUISITION CORP., AS DEFENDANTS, ALLEGING THAT THEY AIDED AND ABETTED THE

ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY.  ON MARCH 18, 2004, TPC AND SPC

ANNOUNCED THAT ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS HAD BEEN SETTLED, SUBJECT TO COURT

APPROVAL. BEFORE COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT, ADDITIONAL SHAREHOLDER

LITIGATION WAS COMMENCED, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2005,

PLAINTIFFS VOLUNTARILY WITHDREW THEIR COMPLAINTS WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

175

BEGINNING IN AUGUST 2004, FOLLOWING POST-MERGER

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY COMMENCED

FOURTEEN PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.  PLAINTIFF SHAREHOLDERS ALLEGED THAT CERTAIN

DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THE APRIL 2004 MERGER BETWEEN TPC AND SPC

CONTAINED FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE VALUE OF SPCS

LOSS RESERVES IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS.  THESE ACTIONS WERE

CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION I,

AND A LEAD PLAINTIFF AND

LEAD COUNSEL WERE APPOINTED.  AN ADDITIONAL PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION BASED ON

THE SAME ALLEGATIONS WAS BROUGHT IN NEW YORK STATE SUPREME COURT.  THIS

ACTION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFERRED TO THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA AND WAS

CONSOLIDATED WITH

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS

SECURITIES LITIGATION I.

ON JUNE 24, 2005, THE LEAD

PLAINTIFF FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT.  THE COMPLAINT DID NOT

SPECIFY DAMAGES. ON AUGUST 23, 2005, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS

IN

IN

RE

ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION I

MOVED TO DISMISS THE

AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT.

ON NOVEMBER 22, 2005, THE PARTIES REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE

THE CASE. THE SETTLEMENT ALSO ENCOMPASSES THE

HENZEL

,

VOZZOLO

AND

FARINA

CASES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ON DECEMBER 28,

2005, THE COURT APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT.

THREE OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE PENDING IN THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.  TWO OF THESE

ACTIONS, WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY CAPTIONED

KAHN V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(NOV. 2,

2004) AND

MICHAEL A. BERNSTEIN PROFIT

SHARING PLAN V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(NOV. 10, 2004), ARE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT BY CERTAIN

SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND

FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.  THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED AS

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION II

,

AND A LEAD PLAINTIFF AND LEAD COUNSEL HAVE BEEN APPOINTED.  ON JULY 11,

2005, THE LEAD PLAINTIFF FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT. THE AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS ALLEGED FAILURE TO MAKE DISCLOSURE RELATING TO

THE PRACTICE OF PAYING BROKERS COMMISSIONS ON A CONTINGENT BASIS, THE COMPANYS

ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN A CONSPIRACY TO RIG BIDS AND THE COMPANYS ALLEGEDLY

IMPROPER USE OF FINITE REINSURANCE PRODUCTS. ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2005, THE

COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

IN

FORMER DIRECTORS, NAMING THE COMPANY AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT.

ROWE V. FISHMAN, ET AL.

(OCT. 22,

2004) AND

CLARK V. FISHMAN, ET AL.

(NOV. 18, 2004).  THE DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR

PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS AS

ROWE, ET AL. V.

FISHMAN, ET AL

. AND A CONSOLIDATED DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN

FILED.  THE CONSOLIDATED DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT ASSERTS STATE LAW CLAIMS,

INCLUDING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, BASED ON ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE

NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO

PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A

FUTURE PERIOD. THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED UNDER MINNESOTA LAW. AS PART OF THAT OBLIGATION, THE

COMPANY WILL ADVANCE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES

THEY INCUR IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS.

176

OTHER

PROCEEDINGS

FROM TIME TO TIME THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN

PROCEEDINGS ADDRESSING DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY

BE INITIATED BY THE COMPANY OR THE REINSURERS AND MAY INVOLVE THE TERMS OF THE

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THE COVERAGE OF PARTICULAR CLAIMS, EXCLUSIONS UNDER THE

AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS COUNTERCLAIMS FOR RESCISSION OF THE AGREEMENTS. ONE OF

THESE DISPUTES IS THE ACTION DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH.

THE COMPANYS GULF OPERATION BROUGHT AN ACTION ON MAY 22,

2003, AS AMENDED ON MAY 12, 2004, IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, COUNTY

OF NEW YORK (

GULF INSURANCE COMPANY V.

TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL.

), AGAINST TRANSATLANTIC

REINSURANCE COMPANY (TRANSATLANTIC), XL REINSURANCE AMERICA, INC. (XL),

ODYSSEY AMERICA REINSURANCE CORPORATION (ODYSSEY), EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE

COMPANY (EMPLOYERS) AND GERLING GLOBAL REINSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA

(GERLING), TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE UNDER REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF

AND RELATED TO GULFS FEBRUARY 2003 SETTLEMENT OF A COVERAGE DISPUTE UNDER

A VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE PROTECTION INSURANCE POLICY. THE REINSURERS HAVE

ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING RESCISSION OF THE VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF

CONTRACT. SEPARATE ACTIONS FILED BY TRANSATLANTIC AND GERLING HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATED WITH THE ORIGINAL GULF ACTION FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES. ON OCTOBER 1,

2003, GULF ENTERED INTO A FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH EMPLOYERS, AND ALL

CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.

ON MAY 26, 2004, THE COURT DENIED GULFS MOTION

TO DISMISS CERTAIN CLAIMS ASSERTED BY TRANSATLANTIC AND A JOINT MOTION BY

TRANSATLANTIC, XL AND ODYSSEY FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST GULF. DISCOVERY IS

CURRENTLY PROCEEDING IN THE MATTERS. GULF DENIES THE REINSURERS ALLEGATIONS,

BELIEVES THAT IT HAS A STRONG LEGAL BASIS TO COLLECT THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THE ACTIONS.

BASED ON THE COMPANYS BELIEFS ABOUT ITS LEGAL

POSITIONS IN ITS VARIOUS REINSURANCE RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT ANY OF THESE MATTERS TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

AS PART OF ONGOING, INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS,

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES.  THE AREAS OF

INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND

AGENTS, THE COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT WITH NON-TRADITIONAL INSURANCE AND

REINSURANCE PRODUCTS, BRANDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SALVAGE AUTOMOBILES AND THE

REPORTING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION PREMIUMS.  THE COMPANY OR ITS

AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS OR WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION, IN EACH

CASE WITH RESPECT TO ONE OR MORE OF THE AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE, FROM: (I) STATE

OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (II) STATE OF CALIFORNIA

DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE; (III) LICENSING AND MARKET CONDUCT COMPLIANCE

DIVISION, FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMISSION OF ONTARIO, CANADA; (IV) STATE OF

CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT; (V) STATE OF CONNECTICUT OFFICE OF THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL; (VI) STATE OF DELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE; (VII) STATE

OF FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES; (VIII) STATE OF FLORIDA

OFFICE OF INSURANCE REGULATION; (IX) STATE OF FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF LEGAL

AFFAIRS OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (X) STATE OF GEORGIA OFFICE OF THE

COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE; (XI) STATE OF ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL

AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION; (XII) STATE OF IOWA INSURANCE DIVISION; (XIII)

STATE OF MARYLAND INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION; (XIV) COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS

OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XV) STATE OF MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE;

(XVI) STATE OF MINNESOTA OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XVII) STATE OF NEW

HAMPSHIRE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT; (XVIII) STATE OF NEW YORK OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY

GENERAL; (XIX) STATE OF NEW YORK INSURANCE DEPARTMENT; (XX) STATE OF NORTH

CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE; (XXI) STATE OF OHIO OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY

GENERAL; (XXII) STATE OF OHIO DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE; (XXIII) COMMONWEALTH OF

PENNSYLVANIA OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XXIV) STATE OF TEXAS DEPARTMENT

OF INSURANCE; (XXV) STATE OF WASHINGTON OFFICE OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER;

(XXVI) STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XXVII) THE UNITED

STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK; AND (XXVIII) THE UNITED

STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAY

RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE

AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE FROM OTHER AGENCIES OR AUTHORITIES.

177

THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, OUTSIDE COUNSEL, WITH THE OVERSIGHT OF

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF CERTAIN

OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES. THIS REVIEW INITIALLY FOCUSED ON THE

COMPANYS RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND WAS COMMENCED AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF

LITIGATION BROUGHT BY THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE AGAINST A MAJOR

BROKER.

THE INTERNAL REVIEW WAS EXPANDED TO ADDRESS THE

VARIOUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION DESCRIBED ABOVE AND TO VERIFY WHETHER THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THESE AREAS HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANYS

REVIEW HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE, INVOLVING THE EXAMINATION OF E-MAILS AND

UNDERWRITING FILES, AS WELL AS INTERVIEWS OF CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES. THE

COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO RECEIVE AND RESPOND TO ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION AND WILL EXPAND ITS REVIEW ACCORDINGLY.

TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS FOUND ONLY A FEW INSTANCES

OF CONDUCT THAT WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE CODE OF CONDUCT. THE

COMPANY HAS RESPONDED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO RESPOND, APPROPRIATELY TO ANY SUCH

CONDUCT.

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL REVIEW WITH RESPECT TO FINITE

REINSURANCE CONSIDERED FINITE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY BOTH PURCHASED AND SOLD. THE

COMPANY HAS COMPLETED ITS REVIEW WITH RESPECT TO THE IDENTIFIED FINITE PRODUCTS

PURCHASED AND SOLD, AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT NO ADJUSTMENT TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS REQUIRED. THE RELATED INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS

PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED ARE ONGOING, AS ARE THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO COOPERATE

WITH THE AUTHORITIES, AND THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES COULD ASK THAT ADDITIONAL

WORK BE PERFORMED OR REACH CONCLUSIONS DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPANYS. ACCORDINGLY,

IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO REACH ANY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF

THESE MATTERS.

SIX PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND TWO

INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS WERE BROUGHT AGAINST A NUMBER OF INSURANCE BROKERS AND

INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, BY PLAINTIFFS

WHO ALLEGEDLY PURCHASED INSURANCE PRODUCTS THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE DEFENDANT

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

.  ON JANUARY 17, 2006, ALL DEFENDANTS MOVED TO

FOR

FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM.  ONE OTHER

PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION,

OFFICE DEPOT, INC. V. MARSH & MCLENNAN

COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(FLA. CIR. CT. JUNE 22, 2005),

HAVE BEEN FILED IN STATE COURT AND ASSERT CLAIMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE

ASSERTED IN

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

AGAINST VARIOUS BROKERS AND INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF

ITS AFFILIATES, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH

IN RE

INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

.  CERTAIN DEFENDANTS IN

BENSLEY CONSTRUCTION, INC.

, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, HAVE REMOVED

THE ACTION TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

MASSACHUSETTS.  ON FEBRUARY 13, 2006, THE

ACTION WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY FOR COORDINATION WITH

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION.

OFFICE DEPOT, INC.

WAS BROUGHT IN FLORIDA STATE COURT AND NAMES SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS

SUBSIDIARIES.  ON NOVEMBER 9, 2005, THE

COURT ENTERED AN ORDER STAYING

OFFICE DEPOT

PENDING RESOLUTION OF

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE

ANTITRUST LITIGATION

.  THE

PLAINTIFF IN

OFFICE DEPOT, INC.

HAS

APPEALED.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY.

IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY

IS INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS, NOT INVOLVING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS, ARISING MOSTLY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS EITHER AS

A LIABILITY INSURER DEFENDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS,

OR AS AN INSURER DEFENDING CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST IT RELATING TO COVERAGE OR

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES.  WHILE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A

FUTURE PERIOD, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT NONE WOULD LIKELY

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

LIQUIDITY.

ON JULY 23, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT

WAS SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF

THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATE PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $1.63

BILLION ($1.07 BILLION AFTER-TAX). THE COMPANY RECORDED THESE ADJUSTMENTS AS

CHARGES IN ITS INCOME STATEMENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. THROUGH AN

INFORMAL COMMENT PROCESS, THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE HAS

SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, WHICH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED.

SPECIFICALLY, THE STAFF HAS ASKED FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANYS

ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN OF SPCS INSURANCE RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES AND PREMIUMS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AND HOW THOSE ADJUSTMENTS MAY

RELATE TO SPCS RESERVES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER. AFTER REVIEWING THE

STAFFS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE. IF, HOWEVER, THE

STAFF DISAGREES, SOME OR ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS BEING DISCUSSED MAY NOT BE

RECORDED AS CHARGES IN THE COMPANYS INCOME STATEMENT, THEREBY INCREASING NET

INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2004 AND INCREASING SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, IN EACH CASE BY THE APPROXIMATE

AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF THE CHANGE. THE EFFECT ON TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

(ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTS OF DEFERRED TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004 WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL.

INCREASES TO GOODWILL AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WOULD BE REFLECTED ON THE

COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET AS OF APRIL 1, 2004, EITHER DUE TO PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING OR ADJUSTMENT OF SPCS RESERVES PRIOR TO THE MERGER.

OTHER COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

COMMITMENTS

INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS

SPCS SALE OF MINET

IN MAY 1997, SPC COMPLETED THE SALE OF

ITS INSURANCE BROKERAGE OPERATION, MINET, TO AON CORPORATION. SPC AGREED TO

INDEMNIFY AON AGAINST ANY FUTURE CLAIMS FOR PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND OTHER

SPECIFIED EVENTS THAT OCCURRED OR EXISTED PRIOR TO THE SALE. THE COMPANY

ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THIS INDEMNIFICATION UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE

MERGER. THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE UNDER THESE CLAIMS ON A REGULAR

BASIS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES RESERVES FOR REPORTED CLAIMS ARE ADEQUATE, BUT IT

DOES NOT HAVE INFORMATION ON UNREPORTED CLAIMS TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF

ADDITIONAL LIABILITY. FROM 1997 TO 2004, SPC PURCHASED INSURANCE TO COVER A

PORTION OF ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH CLAIMS. UNDER THE SALE AGREEMENT, SPC ALSO

COMMITTED TO ACQUIRE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF REINSURANCE BROKERAGE SERVICES FROM AON

THROUGH 2012. THAT COMMITMENT REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE A CONTRACTUAL

PAYMENT TO AON TO THE EXTENT SUCH MINIMUM LEVEL OF SERVICE IS NOT ACQUIRED. THE

MAXIMUM ANNUAL AMOUNT PAYABLE TO AON FOR SUCH SERVICES AND ANY SUCH CONTRACTUAL

PAYMENT RELATED TO THAT COMMITMENT IS $20 MILLION. SPC ALSO HAD COMMITMENTS

UNDER LEASE AGREEMENTS THROUGH 2015 FOR VACATED SPACE (INCLUDED IN LEASE

COMMITMENT TOTALS IN NOTE 15), AS WELL AS A COMMITMENT TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO A

FORMER MINET EXECUTIVE. THE COMPANY ASSUMED ALL OBLIGATIONS TO THESE

COMMITMENTS UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER.

TO THIRD PARTIES, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY PURCHASERS FOR LOSSES

ARISING OUT OF BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE

BUSINESS ENTITIES BEING SOLD, COVENANTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND/OR

ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOLLOWING THE CLOSE, AND IN CERTAIN CASES OBLIGATIONS ARISING

FROM UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES, ADVERSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OR CERTAIN NAMED

LITIGATION. SUCH INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS GENERALLY SURVIVE FOR PERIODS

RANGING FROM 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE APPLICABLE CLOSING DATE TO THE EXPIRATION

OF THE RELEVANT STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, OR IN SOME CASES AGREED UPON TERM

LIMITATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS

OBLIGATION FOR THOSE INDEMNIFICATIONS THAT ARE QUANTIFIABLE RELATED TO SALES OF

BUSINESS ENTITIES WAS $1.82 BILLION. CERTAIN OF THESE CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS

ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES WHICH HAVE TO BE INCURRED BY THE OBLIGEE BEFORE THE

COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS. INCLUDED IN THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 WAS $172 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS VARIABLE

OBLIGATIONS IN FURTHERANCE OF THE SEPARATION OF OPERATIONS AND OWNERSHIP AS A

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WHICH WAS REPAID DURING 2003. INTEREST

CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

THE FOLLOWING CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF

THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN PREPARED PURSUANT TO RULE 3-10 OF REGULATION S-X.

THESE CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED FROM THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON THE SAME BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AS THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. HAS FULLY AND

UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF TPC, ITS WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY, WHICH TOTALED $2.64 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER, TPC FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY

GUARANTEED THE PAYMENT OF ALL PRINCIPAL, PREMIUMS, IF ANY, AND INTEREST ON

CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY TIGHI. THE ST. PAUL

TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. HAS FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED SUCH

GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS OF TPC. TPC IS DEEMED TO HAVE NO ASSETS OR OPERATIONS

INDEPENDENT OF TIGHI. CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR TIGHI HAS NOT

BEEN PRESENTED HEREIN BECAUSE SUCH FINANCIAL INFORMATION WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY

THE SAME AS THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION PROVIDED FOR TPC.

THE AMOUNTS SHOWN IN THE TPC AND OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES COLUMNS IN THE FOLLOWING CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

NOT DIRECTLY COMPARABLE BETWEEN 2005 AND 2004. DURING 2005, THE COMPANY

COMBINED THE PREVIOUSLY SEPARATE ST. PAUL INSURANCE GROUP AND TRAVELERS

PROPERTY CASUALTY REINSURANCE POOLS, FORMING THE NEW ST. PAUL TRAVELERS

REINSURANCE POOL EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005, RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1,

2005. AS A RESULT, THE TPC AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES COLUMNS OF THE

CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2005 REFLECT THE IMPACT OF ALLOCATIONS

OF REVENUES, LOSSES AND EXPENSES MADE PURSUANT TO THE RESPECTIVE ENTITIES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER

THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (EXCHANGE ACT)) THAT ARE

DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANYS

REPORTS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED

WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS RULES AND

FORMS, AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER,

AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURES. ANY

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE

ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THE DESIRED CONTROL OBJECTIVES. AS A

RESULT OF THE MERGER OF SPC AND TPC, THE COMPANY MADE A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN ITS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BEGINNING IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2004 AND CONTINUING THROUGH 2005. THE CHANGES INVOLVED

COMBINING THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS AND THE ATTENDANT PERSONNEL AND

SYSTEM CHANGES. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, HAS EVALUATED THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. BASED UPON THAT EVALUATION AND

SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF

FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE

ACT) THAT OCCURRED DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 THAT HAS

MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

190

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED

TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE

COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED BY MANAGEMENT, ARE UNDER THE GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF

THE COMPANYS AUDIT COMMITTEE.

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.



PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT,

IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES,

AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING

PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION

OF ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO

THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS,

OR THAT THE DEGREE OR COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY

DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE STANDARD

MEASURES ADOPTED BY MANAGEMENT IN MAKING ITS EVALUATION ARE THE MEASURES IN THE

INTERNAL-CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK PUBLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

BASED UPON ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED

THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, AND THAT THERE WERE NO MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF THAT DATE.

KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, WHICH HAS AUDITED AND REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-K, HAS ISSUED ITS WRITTEN ATTESTATION

REPORT ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WHICH FOLLOWS THIS REPORT.

191

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING,

THAT

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND

SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND AN OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE

THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING

AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND

PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR

OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY

OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY

EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS

MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF

COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS

COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE

OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OF THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME,

CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 27, 2006 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

(A)

BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY DEVELOPED A

METHODOLOGY TO ALLOCATE NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND INVESTED ASSETS TO THE

IDENTIFIED SEGMENTS. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS METHODOLOGY. IN 2002 AND 2003, NET INVESTMENT INCOME

FOR EACH SEGMENT WAS ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY, EXCEPT FOR THE PORTION EARNED ON

THE INVESTMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, WHICH WAS ALLOCATED BASED ON ASSIGNED

CAPITAL.

(B)

EXPENSE ALLOCATIONS ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRESCRIBED

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. THESE PRACTICES MAKE A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF

ALL EXPENSES TO THOSE PRODUCT LINES WITH WHICH THEY ARE ASSOCIATED.
