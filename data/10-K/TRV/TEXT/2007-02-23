PRIOR TO ITS MERGER WITH TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) IN 2004, IS

INCORPORATED AS A GENERAL BUSINESS CORPORATION UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF

MINNESOTA AND IS ONE OF THE OLDEST INSURANCE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED

COMPANY EXCLUDING SUBSIDIARIES.

ON APRIL 1, 2004, TPC

MERGED WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF SPC, AS A RESULT OF WHICH TPC BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF SPC, AND SPC CHANGED ITS NAME TO THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE

ACQUISITION WITH TPC TREATED AS THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIRER. ACCORDINGLY, THIS

TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION, USING TPCS

HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND APPLYING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TO THE

ACQUIRED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS OF SPC AS OF APRIL 1, 2004.

BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF SPC WERE CONSOLIDATED WITH TPCS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION. ACCORDINGLY, ALL FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN

FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTS OF TPC

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 AND THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS OF

PUBLIC OFFERING OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK, WAS AN INDIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF CITIGROUP INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES,

CITIGROUP). TPC WAS REORGANIZED IN CONNECTION WITH ITS IPO IN MARCH 2002.

PURSUANT TO THE REORGANIZATION, WHICH WAS COMPLETED ON MARCH 19, 2002, TPCS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

CERTAIN FORMERLY WHOLLY-OWNED TPC SUBSIDIARIES, PRINCIPALLY THE TRAVELERS

INSURANCE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (BEING THE FORMER U.S. LIFE INSURANCE

OPERATIONS OF TPC), CERTAIN OTHER WHOLLY-OWNED NON-INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES OF

TPC AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF TPCS ASSETS AND CERTAIN LIABILITIES NOT RELATED

TO THE PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE BUSINESS.

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AGENT RELATIONSHIPS AND METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION, I.E. USE OF

INDEPENDENT AGENTS, EXCLUSIVE AGENTS AND/OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES. ACCORDING TO A.M.

BEST, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 975 PROPERTY CASUALTY ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES, COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 2,400 PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COMPANIES. OF

THOSE ORGANIZATIONS, THE TOP 150 ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 93% OF THE

COMPETES WITH BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INSURERS. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL PROPERTY

AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE

COMPANY, OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION IN ADDITION TO

TRADITIONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE LARGE DEDUCTIBLE

PROGRAMS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE THAT UTILIZE CAPTIVE INSURANCE

COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS. THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE

MARKETPLACE IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING PREMIUMS CHARGED; CONTRACT

TERMS AND CONDITIONS; PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

OFFERED;

CLAIM SERVICE; AGENT, BROKER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS; RATINGS ASSIGNED BY

INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES; LOCAL PRESENCE; GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS;

ORGANIZATIONS.

PRICING AND

UNDERWRITING

PRICING LEVELS FOR BUSINESS INSURANCE PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN EXPECTATION

OF ESTIMATED LOSSES, THE EXPENSES OF PRODUCING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS AND

A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT. BUSINESS INSURANCE HAS A DISCIPLINED

APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES PROFITABLE GROWTH

RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE.

BUSINESS INSURANCE HAS DEVELOPED AN UNDERWRITING AND

PRICING METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING,

ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINES FOR PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES. THIS

APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING AND PRICING

DISCIPLINE. IT UTILIZES PROPRIETARY DATA GATHERED AND ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO

ITS BUSINESS INSURANCE BUSINESS OVER MANY YEARS. THE UNDERWRITERS AND ENGINEERS

USE THIS INFORMATION TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE RISKS PRIOR TO QUOTATION. THIS

INFORMATION PROVIDES SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

THIS METHODOLOGY ENABLES BUSINESS INSURANCE TO STREAMLINE ITS RISK SELECTION

PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING PARAMETERS THAT WILL NOT COMPROMISE ITS

UNDERWRITING INTEGRITY.

FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES,

SELECT ACCOUNTS USES A PROCESS BASED ON INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATIONS TO ALLOW

AGENTS AND FIELD UNDERWRITING REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE UNDERWRITING AND PRICING

DECISIONS WITHIN PREDETERMINED CLASSIFICATIONS, BECAUSE UNDERWRITING CRITERIA

AND PRICING TEND TO BE MORE STANDARDIZED FOR THESE SMALLER EXPOSURES.

A PORTION OF BUSINESS IN

THIS SEGMENT IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS

COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS

OBLIGATED TO PAY THE

7

CLAIMANT

THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE

CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT AND IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK UNTIL

SUCH REIMBURSEMENT IS MADE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, CONTRACTHOLDER

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ON UNPAID LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE

POLICIES WERE EACH APPROXIMATELY $5.01 BILLION. RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES

ARE ALSO USED FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE. ALTHOUGH THE RETROSPECTIVELY

RATED FEATURE OF THE POLICY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES INSURANCE RISK FOR THE

COMPANY, IT INTRODUCES ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY. PREMIUM

RECEIVABLES FROM HOLDERS OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $223 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL,

PRIMARILY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT CASH COLLATERAL TRUSTS AND

SURETY BONDS, IS GENERALLY REQUESTED FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PLANS AND/OR

RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES THAT PROVIDE FOR DEFERRED COLLECTION OF

DEDUCTIBLE RECOVERIES AND/OR ULTIMATE PREMIUMS. THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL

REQUESTED IS PREDICATED UPON THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER AND THE

NATURE OF THE INSURED RISKS. BUSINESS INSURANCE CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE CREDIT

EXPOSURE ON INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS AND THE ADEQUACY OF COLLATERAL.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY

MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO NATURAL AND MANMADE PERIL CATASTROPHIC LOSSES AND

ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE SUCH EXPOSURE. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, BUSINESS INSURANCE LIMITS THE WRITING OF NEW PROPERTY

BUSINESS AND SELECTIVELY TAKES UNDERWRITING ACTION ON EXISTING BUSINESS IN SOME

MARKETS. IN ADDITION, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED, PRICE

INCREASES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN SOME CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS, AND

DEDUCTIBLES ARE IN PLACE IN HURRICANE AND WIND AND HAIL PRONE AREAS. THE

COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER

MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE UNDERWRITING RISKS OF BUSINESS IN

HURRICANE-PRONE, EARTHQUAKE-PRONE AND TARGET RISK AREAS. THE COMPANY RELIES

UPON THIS ANALYSIS TO MAKE UNDERWRITING DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE ON CATASTROPHE-EXPOSED BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES REINSURANCE TO MANAGE ITS AGGREGATE EXPOSURES

TO CATASTROPHES.  SEE REINSURANCE.

PRODUCT LINES

COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL

PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY

COVERAGE. PROPERTY INSURANCE COVERS DAMAGES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY FIRE, WIND,

HAIL, WATER, THEFT AND VANDALISM, AND PROTECTS BUSINESSES FROM FINANCIAL LOSS

DUE TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION RESULTING FROM A COVERED LOSS. LIABILITY COVERAGE

INSURES BUSINESSES AGAINST THIRD PARTIES FROM ACCIDENTS OCCURRING ON THEIR

PREMISES OR ARISING OUT OF THEIR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS INJURIES SUSTAINED FROM

PRODUCTS SOLD.

WORKERS

COMPENSATION

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYERS FOR SPECIFIED

BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW FOR WORKPLACE INJURIES TO

EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE TYPICALLY FOUR TYPES OF BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER WORKERS

COMPENSATION POLICIES: MEDICAL BENEFITS, DISABILITY BENEFITS, DEATH BENEFITS

AND VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION BENEFITS. THE COMPANY EMPHASIZES MANAGED CARE

COST CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES, WHICH INVOLVE EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES AND CARE

PROVIDERS IN A COOPERATIVE EFFORT THAT FOCUSES ON THE INJURED EMPLOYEES EARLY

RETURN TO WORK, COST-EFFECTIVE QUALITY CARE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THIS

MARKET. THE COMPANY OFFERS THE FOLLOWING THREE TYPES OF WORKERS COMPENSATION

PRODUCTS.

·

GUARANTEED

COST INSURANCE PRODUCTS, IN WHICH POLICY PREMIUM CHARGES ARE FIXED FOR THE

PERIOD OF COVERAGE AND DO NOT VARY AS A RESULT OF THE INSUREDS LOSS

EXPERIENCE;

·

LOSS-SENSITIVE

INSURANCE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LARGE DEDUCTIBLE AND RETROSPECTIVELY RATED

POLICIES, IN WHICH FEES OR PREMIUMS ARE ADJUSTED BASED ON ACTUAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE OF THE INSURED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD; AND

·

SERVICE

PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY SOLD TO THE COMPANYS NATIONAL ACCOUNTS

CUSTOMERS, WHERE THE COMPANY RECEIVES FEES RATHER THAN PREMIUMS FOR PROVIDING

LOSS PREVENTION, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND CLAIM AND BENEFIT ADMINISTRATION SERVICES

TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER SERVICE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO PARTICIPATES IN

STATE ASSIGNED RISK POOLS AS A SERVICING CARRIER AND POOL PARTICIPANT.

POLICY

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION

REFLECTS THE COMPANYS RETENTION POLICY AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007. FOR THIRD

PARTY LIABILITY, BUSINESS INSURANCE GENERALLY LIMITS ITS NET RETENTION TO A

MAXIMUM OF $13 MILLION PER INSURED, PER OCCURRENCE AFTER REINSURANCE. THE NET

RETAINED AMOUNT PER RISK FOR PROPERTY EXPOSURES IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO $15

MILLION, AFTER REINSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE

TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIMITS CAPACITY OR TO REDUCE RETENTIONS ON AN INDIVIDUAL

RISK BASIS. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO RETAIN AMOUNTS GREATER THAN THOSE DESCRIBED

HEREIN BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RISK.

COMPETITION

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS REPRESENTED IN THE

COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE BY MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZE AS WELL AS

OTHER ENTITIES OFFERING RISK ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS OR

CAPTIVE PROGRAMS. MARKET COMPETITION WORKS WITHIN THE INSURANCE REGULATORY

FRAMEWORK TO SET THE PRICE CHARGED FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND THE LEVEL OF

SERVICE PROVIDED. GROWTH IS DRIVEN BY A COMPANYS ABILITY TO PROVIDE INSURANCE

AND SERVICES AT A PRICE THAT IS REASONABLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE CUSTOMER. IN

ADDITION, THE MARKETPLACE IS AFFECTED BY AVAILABLE CAPACITY OF THE INSURANCE

INDUSTRY, AS MEASURED BY POLICYHOLDERS SURPLUS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF

REINSURANCE. SURPLUS EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS PRIMARILY IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROFIT

LEVELS GENERATED BY THE INDUSTRY. CAPITAL RAISED BY DEBT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS

ALSO INCREASES A COMPANYS SURPLUS. GROWTH IN PREMIUM AND SERVICE BUSINESS IS

ALSO MEASURED BY A COMPANYS ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND TO

ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, MANY LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS

SELF-INSURE THEIR RISKS OR UTILIZE LARGE DEDUCTIBLES ON PURCHASED INSURANCE.

SELECT ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY WRITTEN THROUGH

INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS AND DIRECT

WRITERS. BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES

COMPETE IN THE SELECT ACCOUNTS MARKET WHICH GENERALLY COMPRISES LOWER HAZARD, MAIN

STREET BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. RISKS ARE UNDERWRITTEN AND PRICED USING STANDARD

INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY AND STANDARD INDUSTRY

PRODUCT OFFERINGS. COMPETITION IN THIS MARKET IS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRICE,

PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND RESPONSE TIME IN POLICY SERVICES. SELECT ACCOUNTS HAS

ESTABLISHED A STRONG MARKETING RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND

HAS PROVIDED IT WITH DEFINED UNDERWRITING POLICIES, A BROAD ARRAY OF PRODUCTS,

COMPETITIVE PRICES AND ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT AUTOMATED ENVIRONMENTS IN THE

INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED CENTRALIZED SERVICE CENTERS

TO HELP AGENTS PERFORM MANY SERVICE FUNCTIONS, IN RETURN FOR A FEE. SELECT

ACCOUNTS OVERALL SERVICE PLATFORM IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST IN THE SMALL

BUSINESS COMMERCIAL MARKET.

COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS

BUSINESS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN WRITTEN THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS,

ALTHOUGH SOME COMPANIES USE DIRECT WRITING. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE

PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES WILLING TO WRITE MOST

CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND PRICING, AND REGIONAL

INSURANCE COMPANIES. COMPANIES COMPETE ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, RESPONSE

TIME IN POLICY ISSUANCE AND CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY,

IMPROVED EFFICIENCY THROUGH AUTOMATION AND RESPONSE TIME TO CUSTOMER NEEDS ARE

KEY TO SUCCESS IN THIS MARKET.

THE NATIONAL

ACCOUNTS GROUP IS COMPRISED OF THREE BUSINESS UNITS.

·

NATIONAL

ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY WRITTEN THROUGH NATIONAL BROKERS AND, TO A

LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS. INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE IN THIS MARKET

BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES, MANAGED

CARE COST CONTAINMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. NATIONAL

ACCOUNTS ALSO OFFERS A LARGE NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCALIZED CLAIM SERVICE

CENTERS WHICH PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN CLAIMS ADJUSTING AND ALLOWS

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS TO MORE QUICKLY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS.

·

DISCOVER

RE COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL PROVIDERS OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COVERAGES, AS

WELL AS OTHER UNDERWRITERS OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE IN THE

ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER MARKET, SUCH AS RISK RETENTION GROUPS, SELF-INSURANCE

PLANS, CAPTIVES MANAGED BY OTHERS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER RISK-FINANCING

VEHICLES AND MECHANISMS.

·

NATIONAL

ACCOUNTS RESIDUAL MARKET BUSINESS COMPETES FOR STATE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE

CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES. THESE CONTRACTS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE

THREE-YEAR TERMS, ARE SELECTED BY STATE AGENCIES THROUGH A BID PROCESS BASED ON

THE QUALITY OF SERVICE AND PRICE. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS SERVICES APPROXIMATELY 36%

OF THE TOTAL WORKERS COMPENSATION ASSIGNED RISK MARKET, MAKING THE COMPANY ONE

OF THE LARGEST SERVICING CARRIERS IN THE INDUSTRY.

10

THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER

BUSINESS GROUPS IN BUSINESS INSURANCE THAT COMPETE IN FOCUSED TARGET MARKETS.

EACH OF THESE MARKETS IS DIFFERENT AND REQUIRES UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF INDUSTRY

KNOWLEDGE, PROPRIETARY COVERAGE FORMS, SPECIALIZED RISK CONTROL AND LOSS

HANDLING SERVICES, AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENTS AND BROKERS THAT ALSO FOCUS ON

THESE MARKETS. IN SOME CASES THE COMPETITION IS NATIONAL CARRIERS WITH

SIMILARLY DEDICATED UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING GROUPS. IN OTHER CASES, SMALLER

REGIONAL COMPANIES TEND TO BE THE PRIMARY COMPETITION. IN EITHER CASE, THESE

BUSINESSES HAVE REGIONAL STRUCTURES THAT ALLOW THEM TO DELIVER PERSONALIZED

SERVICE AND LOCAL KNOWLEDGE TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. SPECIALIZED AGENTS AND

BROKERS, INCLUDING MANAGING GENERAL AGENTS AND WHOLESALE AGENTS, SUPPLEMENT

THIS STRATEGY. IN ALL OF THESE BUSINESSES, THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY IS MARKET

LEADERSHIP ATTAINED THROUGH FOCUSED INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE APPLIED TO INSURANCE AND

RISK NEEDS.

FINANCIAL,

PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE

THE FINANCIAL,

PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT INCLUDES SURETY AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITY COVERAGES, WHICH REQUIRE A PRIMARILY CREDIT-BASED

UNDERWRITING PROCESS, AS WELL AS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY PRODUCTS THAT ARE

PRIMARILY MARKETED ON AN INTERNATIONAL BASIS. THE SEGMENT INCLUDES THE

FOLLOWING BUSINESSES.

·

BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

PROVIDES

A WIDE RANGE OF CUSTOMERS WITH BOND AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

SERVICES. THE RANGE OF COVERAGES INCLUDES SURETY AND FIDELITY BONDS FOR

CONSTRUCTION AND GENERAL COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND

MANAGEMENT LIABILITY FOR PUBLIC CORPORATIONS, PRIVATE COMPANIES AND

NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OR MISCONDUCT

OF NAMED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS; PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY FOR A VARIETY OF

PROFESSIONALS, SUCH AS LAWYERS, DESIGN PROFESSIONALS AND REAL ESTATE AGENTS FOR

LIABILITY FROM ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COMMITTED IN THE COURSE OF PROFESSIONAL

CONDUCT OR PRACTICE; AND A FULL RANGE OF PROPERTY, AUTO, LIABILITY, FIDELITY

AND PROFESSIONAL/MANAGEMENT LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THIS BUSINESS REPRESENTS THE FOURTH QUARTER 2006 COMBINATION OF THE COMPANYS

PREVIOUS

BOND

AND

FINANCIAL &

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

MARKETING GROUPS.

IN DECEMBER 2006, THE

COMPANY REACHED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS MEXICAN SURETY SUBSIDIARY,

AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES, S.A. DE C.V., WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR $79 MILLION OF NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2006. THE IMPACT OF THIS TRANSACTION WILL NOT BE MATERIAL

TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

SEVERAL CUSTOMER GROUPS WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF

IRELAND AND BUSINESS WRITTEN AS A CORPORATE MEMBER AT LLOYDS.

OF THE LLOYDS PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS AND, IN EARLY 2005, SOLD THE RIGHT TO

RENEW THIS BUSINESS AS WELL AS THE OPERATING COMPANIES THAT SUPPORTED IT.

INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, BOND &

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS CONSIDERS EACH AGENCYS OR BROKERS PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL

STABILITY, STAFF EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH ITS OPERATING AND MARKETING

PLANS. ONCE AN AGENCY OR BROKER IS APPOINTED, ITS ONGOING PERFORMANCE IS

MONITORED. IN ADDITION, BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS SELLS ITS SURETY

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING LEVELS FOR FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL &

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY

DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN EXPECTATION OF THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF ESTIMATED

LOSSES, THE EXPENSES OF PRODUCING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, AND A

REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT. FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL &

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK

MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES PROFITABLE GROWTH RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR

MARKET SHARE.

12

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL &

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE HAS DEVELOPED AN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING METHODOLOGY

THAT INCORPORATES DEDICATED UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL AND

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINES. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY

UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DISCIPLINE, BASED ON AN IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THE

SPECIFIC ACCOUNT OR INDUSTRY ISSUES. THE UNDERWRITERS USE PROPRIETARY DATA

GATHERED AND ANALYZED OVER MANY YEARS TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE RISKS PRIOR TO

QUOTATION, AND THEN USE PROPRIETARY FORMS TO TAILOR INSURANCE COVERAGE TO

INSUREDS WITHIN THE TARGET MARKETS. THIS METHODOLOGY ENABLES FINANCIAL,

PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE TO STREAMLINE ITS RISK

SELECTION PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING PARAMETERS THAT WILL NOT COMPROMISE ITS

UNDERWRITING INTEGRITY.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY

MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO NATURAL AND MANMADE PERIL CATASTROPHIC LOSSES AND

ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE SUCH EXPOSURE. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE

LIMITS THE WRITING OF NEW COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND ENERGY AND MARINE BUSINESS

AND SELECTIVELY TAKES UNDERWRITING ACTION ON EXISTING BUSINESS IN SOME MARKETS.

IN ADDITION, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED, PRICE INCREASES HAVE

BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN SOME CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS, AND DEDUCTIBLES ARE IN PLACE

IN HURRICANE AND WIND AND HAIL PRONE AREAS. THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES

AND METHODS, INCLUDING SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE

UNDERWRITING RISKS OF BUSINESS IN HURRICANE-PRONE, EARTHQUAKE-PRONE AND TARGET

RISK AREAS. THE COMPANY RELIES UPON THIS ANALYSIS TO MAKE UNDERWRITING

DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE ON CATASTROPHE-EXPOSED BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES REINSURANCE TO

MANAGE ITS AGGREGATE EXPOSURES TO CATASTROPHES.

COMPETITION

THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE IN WHICH THE FINANCIAL,

PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT OPERATES IS AFFECTED BY

MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY FOR THE BUSINESS INSURANCE

SEGMENT. BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS COMPETES WITH OTHER STOCK

COMPANIES, MUTUAL COMPANIES, ALTERNATIVE RISK SHARING GROUPS AND OTHER

UNDERWRITING ORGANIZATIONS. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES WILLING TO WRITE MOST CLASSES OF

BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND PRICING AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT,

REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMPANIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED NICHE PROGRAMS

FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, MANY LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS

SELF-INSURE THEIR RISKS OR UTILIZE LARGE DEDUCTIBLES ON PURCHASED INSURANCE.

BOND & FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS UNDERWRITES AND MARKETS ITS PRODUCTS TO NATIONAL, MID-SIZED AND SMALL

BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS, AND DISTRIBUTES THEM

THROUGH BOTH NATIONAL AND WHOLESALE BROKERS, REGIONAL BROKERS, AND RETAIL

AGENTS. BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS COMPETES IN THE COMPETITIVE SURETY

AND MANAGEMENT LIABILITY MARKETPLACES, AS WELL AS OFFERING GENERAL PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY COVERAGES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE WITH BOND & FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS. ITS REPUTATION FOR TIMELY AND CONSISTENT DECISION-MAKING, A

NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCAL UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS AND INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND

STRONG PRODUCER AND

14

CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS, AS WELL AS ITS ABILITY TO OFFER ITS CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE OF

PRODUCTS, PROVIDES BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AN ADVANTAGE OVER MANY OF

ITS COMPETITORS AND ENABLES IT TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN A COMPLEX, DYNAMIC

MARKETPLACE. THE ABILITY OF BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS TO CROSS-SELL

ITS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS OF THE BUSINESS INSURANCE AND PERSONAL INSURANCE

SEGMENTS PROVIDES FURTHER COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES FOR THE COMPANY.

INTERNATIONAL COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS INTERNATIONAL AND

LOCAL COUNTRY INSURERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF

IRELAND. COMPANIES COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE

LEVEL OF CLAIM AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROVIDED. THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED

EXPERTISE IN VARIOUS MARKETS IN THESE COUNTRIES SIMILAR TO THOSE SERVED IN THE

UNITED STATES AND PROVIDES BOTH PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COVERAGE FOR THESE

MARKETS. PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A RELATIVELY SMALL BROKER

BASE WHOSE CUSTOMER GROUPS ALIGN WITH THE COMPANYS TARGETED MARKETS.

AT LLOYDS, THE COMPANY

COMPETES WITH OTHER SYNDICATES OPERATING IN THE LLOYDS MARKET AS WELL AS

INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC INSURERS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS WHERE THE COMPANY

WRITES BUSINESS WORLDWIDE. LLOYDS SYNDICATES ARE INCREASINGLY CAPITALIZED BY

CORPORATE CAPITAL, MUCH OF WHICH IS PROVIDED BY LARGE INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE

ENTERPRISES. COMPETITION IS AGAIN BASED ON PRICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS. THE

COMPANY HAS AN EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON LINES IT BELIEVES IT CAN UNDERWRITE

EFFECTIVELY AND PROFITABLY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON SHORT-TAIL INSURANCE LINES. THE

COMPANY UNDERWRITES THROUGH FOUR PRINCIPAL LINES OF BUSINESS AT LLOYDS.

AVIATION, MARINE, GLOBAL PROPERTY, AND ACCIDENT AND SPECIAL RISKS.

PERSONAL INSURANCE

PERSONAL INSURANCE WRITES VIRTUALLY ALL TYPES OF

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COVERING PERSONAL RISKS. THE PRIMARY COVERAGES

IN PERSONAL INSURANCE ARE AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE SOLD TO

PRINCIPAL MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION

PERSONAL INSURANCE

PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 8,700 INDEPENDENT

AGENTS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, SUPPORTED BY PERSONNEL IN ELEVEN

MARKETING REGIONS, THREE SINGLE STATE COMPANIES AND SIX SERVICE CENTERS. IN

SELECTING NEW INDEPENDENT AGENCIES TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, PERSONAL

INSURANCE CONSIDERS EACH AGENCYS PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL STABILITY, STAFF

EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH PERSONAL INSURANCES OPERATING AND MARKETING

PLANS. ONCE AN AGENCY IS APPOINTED, PERSONAL INSURANCE CAREFULLY MONITORS ITS

PERFORMANCE. WHILE THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS FOR PERSONAL INSURANCES INSURANCE

PRODUCTS ARE IN STATES ALONG THE EAST COAST, IN THE SOUTH AND TEXAS, PERSONAL

INSURANCE IS EXPANDING ITS GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

PERSONAL INSURANCE

OPERATES SINGLE STATE COMPANIES IN MASSACHUSETTS, NEW JERSEY AND FLORIDA WITH

PRODUCTS MARKETED PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS. THESE STATES

REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 19% OF PERSONAL INSURANCE DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN

2006. THE COMPANIES WERE ESTABLISHED TO MANAGE COMPLEX MARKETS IN MASSACHUSETTS

AND NEW JERSEY AND PROPERTY CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE IN FLORIDA. EACH COMPANY HAS

DEDICATED RESOURCES IN UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, FINANCE, LEGAL AND SERVICE

FUNCTIONS.

PERSONAL INSURANCE USES A

CONSISTENT OPERATING MODEL WITH AGENTS OUTSIDE OF THE SINGLE STATE COMPANIES

(SEE DISCUSSION ABOVE). THE MODEL PROVIDES TECHNOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES TO AGENTS

TO MAXIMIZE THEIR EASE OF DOING BUSINESS. PERSONAL INSURANCE AGENTS QUOTE AND

ISSUE APPROXIMATELY 99% OF PERSONAL INSURANCES POLICIES DIRECTLY FROM THEIR

AGENCIES BY LEVERAGING EITHER THEIR OWN AGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR USING

PERSONAL INSURANCES PROPRIETARY QUOTE AND ISSUANCE SYSTEMS WHICH ALLOWS AGENTS

TO RATE, QUOTE AND ISSUE POLICIES ON LINE. ALL OF THESE QUOTE AND ISSUE

PLATFORMS INTERFACE WITH PERSONAL INSURANCES UNDERWRITING AND RATING SYSTEMS,

WHICH EDIT TRANSACTIONS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH PERSONAL INSURANCES UNDERWRITING

AND PRICING PROGRAMS. BUSINESS PROCESSED BY AGENTS ON THESE PLATFORMS IS

SUBJECT TO CONSULTATIVE REVIEW BY PERSONAL INSURANCES IN-HOUSE UNDERWRITERS.

PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO PROVIDES A DOWNLOAD CAPABILITY THAT REFRESHES THE

INDIVIDUAL AGENCY SYSTEM DATABASES OF APPROXIMATELY 6,000 AGENTS EACH DAY WITH

UPDATED POLICY INFORMATION.

PERSONAL INSURANCE

CONTINUES TO DEVELOP FUNCTIONALITY TO PROVIDE ITS AGENTS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE

ARRAY OF ONLINE SERVICE CAPABILITIES PACKAGED TOGETHER IN AN EASY-TO-USE AGENCY

SERVICE PORTAL, INCLUDING CUSTOMER SERVICE, MARKETING AND CLAIM FUNCTIONALITY.

AGENCIES CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO SHIFT THE ONGOING SERVICE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

PERSONAL INSURANCES CUSTOMERS TO ONE OF THE COMPANYS FOUR CUSTOMER CARE

CENTERS, WHERE THE COMPANY RENDERS CUSTOMER SERVICE ON BEHALF OF AN AGENCY BY

PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF DIRECT CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS, INCLUDING

RESPONSE TO BILLING AND COVERAGE INQUIRIES, AND POLICY CHANGES. APPROXIMATELY 1,300

AGENTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SERVICE ALTERNATIVE.

PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO

MARKETS THROUGH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INCLUDING SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS EMPLOYERS AND CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS, AND JOINT MARKETING

ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER INSURERS. PERSONAL INSURANCE HANDLES THE SALES AND

SERVICE FOR THESE PROGRAMS EITHER THROUGH A SPONSORING INDEPENDENT AGENT OR

THROUGH TWO OF THE COMPANYS CALL CENTER LOCATIONS. A NUMBER OF WELL-KNOWN

CORPORATIONS MAKE THE COMPANYS PRODUCT OFFERINGS AVAILABLE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES

PRIMARILY THROUGH A PAYROLL DEDUCTION PAYMENT PROCESS. THE COMPANY HAS

SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE

ASSOCIATION (AAA) CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER AFFINITY GROUPS THAT

MAKE AVAILABLE PERSONAL INSURANCES PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO THEIR MEMBERS. SINCE

1995, THE COMPANY HAS HAD A MARKETING AGREEMENT WITH GEICO TO UNDERWRITE

HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS FOR THEIR AUTO CUSTOMERS. THIS AGREEMENT HAS ADDED

PROFITABLE BUSINESS AND HELPED TO GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSIFY THE HOMEOWNERS LINE

OF BUSINESS.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING LEVELS FOR

PERSONAL INSURANCE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY

DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN EXPECTATION OF ESTIMATED LOSSES, THE EXPENSE OF

PRODUCING, ISSUING AND SERVICING

16

THE

BUSINESS AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT AND CONTINGENCIES. THE COMPANY

HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES

PROFITABLE GROWTH RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE.

PERSONAL INSURANCE HAS

DEVELOPED A PRODUCT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT INTEGRATES THE DISCIPLINES OF

UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THIS APPROACH IS

DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING DISCIPLINE AND PRICING

SEGMENTATION. PROPRIETARY DATA IS ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO PERSONAL INSURANCES

BUSINESS OVER MANY YEARS. PERSONAL INSURANCE USES A VARIETY OF PROPRIETARY AND

VENDOR PRODUCED RISK DIFFERENTIATION MODELS TO FACILITATE ITS PRICING

SEGMENTATION. PERSONAL INSURANCES PRODUCT MANAGERS ESTABLISH STRICT

UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES INTEGRATED WITH ITS FILED PRICING AND RATING PLANS,

WHICH ENABLE PERSONAL INSURANCE TO STREAMLINE ITS RISK SELECTION AND PRICING

PROCESSES.

PRICING FOR PERSONAL

AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE IS DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND BY

INFLATION IN THE COST OF AUTOMOBILE REPAIRS, MEDICAL CARE AND LITIGATION OF

LIABILITY CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS IS LARGELY

DEPENDENT ON PROMPTLY IDENTIFYING AND RECTIFYING DISPARITIES BETWEEN PREMIUM

LEVELS AND PROJECTED CLAIM COSTS, AND OBTAINING APPROVAL FROM STATE REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES WHEN NECESSARY FOR FILED RATE CHANGES.

PRICING IN THE HOMEOWNERS

BUSINESS IS ALSO DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND BY INFLATION

IN THE COST OF BUILDING SUPPLIES, LABOR AND HOUSEHOLD POSSESSIONS. MOST

HOMEOWNERS POLICIES OFFER, BUT DO NOT REQUIRE, AUTOMATIC INCREASES IN COVERAGE

TO REFLECT GROWTH IN REPLACEMENT COSTS AND PROPERTY VALUES. IN ADDITION TO THE

NORMAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY MULTIPLE PERIL COVERAGE, THE PROFITABILITY AND

PRICING OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IS AFFECTED BY THE INCIDENCE OF NATURAL

DISASTERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO WEATHER AND EARTHQUAKES. IN ORDER TO

REDUCE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, PERSONAL INSURANCE LIMITS

THE WRITING OF NEW HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS AND SELECTIVELY TAKES UNDERWRITING

ACTION ON EXISTING BUSINESS IN SOME MARKETS. IN ADDITION, UNDERWRITING

STANDARDS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED, PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN SOME CATASTROPHE-PRONE

AREAS, AND DEDUCTIBLES ARE IN PLACE IN HURRICANE AND WIND AND HAIL PRONE AREAS.

PERSONAL INSURANCE USES COMPUTER-MODELING TECHNIQUES TO ASSESS ITS LEVEL OF

EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS. CHANGES

TO METHODS OF MARKETING AND UNDERWRITING IN SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

STATE-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, WHICH CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN INSURER TO

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES.

INSURERS WRITING PERSONAL

LINES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES MAY BE UNABLE TO INCREASE PRICES UNTIL

SOME TIME AFTER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COVERAGE HAVE INCREASED, PRIMARILY

BECAUSE OF STATE INSURANCE RATE REGULATION. THE PACE AT WHICH AN INSURER CAN

CHANGE RATES IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED COSTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON WHETHER THE

APPLICABLE STATE LAW REQUIRES PRIOR APPROVAL OF RATE INCREASES OR NOTIFICATION

TO THE REGULATOR EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER A RATE CHANGE IS IMPOSED. IN STATES

WITH PRIOR APPROVAL LAWS, RATES MUST BE APPROVED BY THE REGULATOR BEFORE BEING

USED BY THE INSURER. IN STATES HAVING FILE-AND-USE LAWS, THE INSURER MUST

FILE RATE CHANGES WITH THE REGULATOR, BUT DOES NOT NEED TO WAIT FOR APPROVAL

BEFORE USING THE NEW RATES. A USE-AND-FILE LAW REQUIRES AN INSURER TO FILE

RATES WITHIN A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE INSURER BEGINS USING THE NEW RATE.

APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE STATES REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL OF MOST RATE

CHANGES. THE COMPANYS ABILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO RAISE PRICES, MODIFY

UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCE EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE

TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND/OR

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IT MIGHT

NOT OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING ACCESS TO OTHER

UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES.

INDEPENDENT AGENTS EITHER

UTILIZE ONE OF THE COMPANYS AUTOMATED QUOTE AND ISSUE SYSTEMS OR THEY SUBMIT

APPLICATIONS TO THE COMPANYS SERVICE CENTERS FOR UNDERWRITING REVIEW, QUOTE,

AND ISSUANCE. AUTOMATED TRANSACTIONS ARE EDITED BY THE COMPANYS SYSTEMS AND

ISSUED IF THEY CONFORM TO ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. EXCEPTIONS ARE REVIEWED BY

UNDERWRITERS IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS CENTERS. AUDITS ARE CONDUCTED BY

BUSINESS CENTER UNDERWRITERS AND AGENCY MANAGERS, ON A SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING

BASIS, ACROSS ALL OF THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT AGENCY GENERATED BUSINESS. EACH

AGENT IS ASSIGNED TO A SPECIFIC EMPLOYEE OR

17

TEAM OF

EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THE AGENT ON BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT,

MARKETING, AND OVERALL GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY USES AGENCY LEVEL

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION TO ANALYZE AND UNDERSTAND RESULTS AND TO IDENTIFY

PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES.

THE PERSONAL INSURANCE

PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH ADDITIONAL MARKETING CHANNELS UTILIZE THE SAME QUOTE AND

ISSUANCE SYSTEMS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY AND EXCEPTIONS ARE UNDERWRITTEN BY THE

COMPANYS EMPLOYEES. UNDERWRITERS WORK WITH COMPANY MANAGEMENT ON BUSINESS PLAN

DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND OVERALL GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. CHANNEL-SPECIFIC

PRODUCTION AND CLAIM INFORMATION IS USED TO ANALYZE RESULTS AND IDENTIFY

PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES.

PRODUCT LINES

THE PRIMARY COVERAGES IN

PERSONAL INSURANCE ARE PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE SOLD TO

INDIVIDUALS. PERSONAL INSURANCE HAD APPROXIMATELY 7.1 MILLION POLICIES IN FORCE

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

PERSONAL

AUTOMOBILE

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY TO OTHERS FOR BOTH

BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE AND FOR PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO AN INSUREDS OWN

VEHICLE FROM COLLISION AND VARIOUS OTHER PERILS. IN ADDITION, MANY STATES

REQUIRE POLICIES TO PROVIDE FIRST-PARTY PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION, FREQUENTLY

REFERRED TO AS NO-FAULT COVERAGE.

HOMEOWNERS

AND OTHER

PROVIDES PROTECTION AGAINST LOSSES TO DWELLINGS AND

CONTENTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF PERILS, AS WELL AS COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY

ARISING FROM OWNERSHIP OR OCCUPANCY. THE COMPANY WRITES HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE

FOR DWELLINGS, CONDOMINIUMS AND RENTAL PROPERTY CONTENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO

WRITES COVERAGE FOR PERSONAL WATERCRAFT, PERSONAL ARTICLES SUCH AS JEWELRY, AND

UMBRELLA LIABILITY PROTECTION.

NET RETENTION POLICY

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION

REFLECTS THE COMPANYS RETENTION POLICY AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007. PERSONAL

INSURANCE RETAINS THE FIRST $5 MILLION OF UMBRELLA POLICIES AND PURCHASES

FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE FOR LIMITS OVER $5 MILLION. FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY

INSURANCE, THERE IS A $6 MILLION MAXIMUM RETENTION PER RISK. THE COMPANY ALSO

UTILIZES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIMITS CAPACITY OR TO

REDUCE RETENTIONS ON AN INDIVIDUAL RISK BASIS. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO RETAIN

AMOUNTS GREATER THAN THOSE DESCRIBED HEREIN BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RISK

COMPETITION

PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE

IS WRITTEN BY HUNDREDS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZES. ALTHOUGH

NATIONAL COMPANIES WRITE THE MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESS, PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO

FACES COMPETITION FROM LOCAL AND REGIONAL COMPANIES WHICH OFTEN HAVE A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCAL MARKETPLACE AND

THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL AGENTS. PERSONAL INSURANCE BELIEVES THAT THE

PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS ARE PRICE, SERVICE, PERCEIVED STABILITY OF THE

INSURER AND NAME RECOGNITION. PERSONAL INSURANCE COMPETES FOR BUSINESS WITHIN

EACH INDEPENDENT AGENCY SINCE THESE AGENCIES ALSO OFFER POLICIES OF COMPETING

COMPANIES. AT THE AGENCY LEVEL, COMPETITION IS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRICE AND THE

LEVEL OF SERVICE, INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF AUTOMATION

AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIVIDUAL AGENTS. PERSONAL

INSURANCE ALSO COMPETES WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT USE EXCLUSIVE AGENTS OR

SALARIED EMPLOYEES TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO ITS TRADITIONAL

INDEPENDENT AGENCY DISTRIBUTION, PERSONAL INSURANCE HAS BROADENED ITS

DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS BY MARKETING TO SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING

EMPLOYEE AND AFFINITY GROUPS, AND THROUGH JOINT MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH

OTHER INSURERS. PERSONAL INSURANCE BELIEVES THAT ITS CONTINUED FOCUS ON UNDERWRITING

AND PRICING SEGMENTATION, CLAIM SETTLEMENT EFFECTIVENESS STRATEGIES AND EXPENSE

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ENABLE PERSONAL INSURANCE TO PRICE ITS PRODUCTS

COMPETITIVELY IN ALL OF ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

THE

COMPANYS CLAIMS MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH ITS FOCUS ON OPTIMIZING

CLAIM OUTCOMES, COST EFFICIENCY AND SERVICE ARE CRITICAL TO THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO GROW PROFITABLY AND REFLECT THESE CORE TENETS.

·

FAIR,

EFFICIENT, FACT-BASED CLAIMS MANAGEMENT PROCESSES;

·

USE

OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES FRONT-LINE CLAIM PROFESSIONALS WITH NECESSARY

INFORMATION AND FACILITATES PROMPT CLAIM RESOLUTION;

19

·

SPECIALIZATION

OF CLAIM PROFESSIONALS AND SEGMENTATION OF CLAIMS BY COMPLEXITY, AS INDICATED

BY SEVERITY, COVERAGE AND CAUSATION, ALLOW THE COMPANY TO FOCUS ITS RESOURCES

·

EFFECTIVE

COLLABORATION, USING MEANINGFUL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, ACROSS ALL DIVISIONS

WITHIN THE COMPANY FACILITATES PRODUCT ANALYSIS AND ENHANCES RISK SELECTION AND

RISK PRICING; AND

·

EXCELLENT

CUSTOMER SERVICE ENHANCES CUSTOMER RETENTION.

THE COMPANYS CLAIMS

FUNCTION IS MANAGED THROUGH ITS CLAIM SERVICES OPERATIONS. WITH NEARLY 13,000

EMPLOYEES, CLAIM SERVICES EMPLOYS A DIVERSE GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS, INCLUDING

CLAIM ADJUSTERS, APPRAISERS, ATTORNEYS, INVESTIGATORS, ENGINEERS, ACCOUNTANTS,

SYSTEM SPECIALISTS AND TRAINING, MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL. APPROVED

EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS INDEPENDENT ADJUSTERS AND APPRAISERS,

INVESTIGATORS AND ATTORNEYS, ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE AS APPROPRIATE.

FIELD CLAIM MANAGEMENT

TEAMS LOCATED IN 29 CLAIM CENTERS AND 89 SATELLITE AND SPECIALTY-ONLY OFFICES

IN 46 STATES ARE ORGANIZED TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC CLAIM

CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE TO THE BUSINESSES WITHIN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE,

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE, AND PERSONAL

INSURANCE SEGMENTS. CLAIM TEAMS WITH SPECIALIZED SKILLS, RESOURCES, AND

WORKFLOWS ARE MATCHED TO THE UNIQUE EXPOSURES OF THOSE BUSINESSES WITH LOCAL

CLAIM MANAGEMENT DEDICATED TO ACHIEVING OPTIMAL RESULTS WITHIN EACH SEGMENT.

THE COMPANYS HOME OFFICE OPERATIONS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF

WORKFLOW DESIGN, QUALITY MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCED

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS, TRAINING, FINANCIAL REPORTING AND

CONTROL, AND HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY. IN ADDITION TO THE FIELD TEAMS, CLAIM

STAFF IS DEDICATED TO EACH OF PERSONAL INSURANCES SINGLE STATE COMPANIES IN

FLORIDA, MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW JERSEY. THIS STRUCTURE PERMITS THE COMPANY TO

MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF A LARGER, ESTABLISHED COMPANY WHILE

RETAINING THE AGILITY TO RESPOND PROMPTLY TO THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS, BROKERS,

AGENTS AND UNDERWRITERS. CLAIMS MANAGEMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL IS GENERALLY

PROVIDED LOCALLY BY STAFF IN THE RESPECTIVE INTERNATIONAL LOCATION DUE TO LOCAL

KNOWLEDGE OF APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE

COMPANYS STRATEGY TO BENEFIT CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS IS ITS CONTINUING

INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INSURANCE FRAUD THROUGH ITS

INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES UNIT. THE COMPANY HAS A NATIONWIDE STAFF OF EXPERTS THAT

INVESTIGATE A WIDE ARRAY OF INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEMES USING IN-HOUSE FORENSIC

RESOURCES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS. THIS STAFF ALSO HAS SPECIALIZED

EXPERTISE IN FIRE SCENE EXAMINATIONS, MEDICAL PROVIDER FRAUD SCHEMES AND DATA

MINING. THE COMPANY ALSO DEDICATES INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT

VIOLATIONS OF LAW ARE REPORTED TO AND PROSECUTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

CLAIM SERVICES USES

ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, AND DATA ANALYSIS TO ASSIST THE

COMPANY IN REVIEWING ITS CLAIM PRACTICES AND RESULTS TO EVALUATE AND IMPROVE

ITS PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANYS CLAIM MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON

SEGMENTATION OF CLAIMS AND APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL SPECIALIZATION TO DRIVE

EFFECTIVE CLAIM RESOLUTION. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS INVESTMENT IN

CLAIM RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE FOCUS ON CLAIM OUTCOMES AND A

DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT. IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS

INVESTED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN MANY OF ITS CLAIM HANDLING

OPERATIONS AND ROUTINELY MONITORS THE EFFECT OF ITS INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE A

CONSISTENT OPTIMIZATION BETWEEN OUTCOMES, COST, AND SERVICE.

DURING 2006, CLAIM

SERVICES REFINED ITS CATASTROPHIC RESPONSE STRATEGY TO INCREASE THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO RESPOND TO A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHIC EVENT USING ITS OWN PERSONNEL,

PLACING LESS RELIANCE ON INDEPENDENT ADJUSTORS AND APPRAISERS. THE COMPANY

ESTABLISHED A LARGER DEDICATED CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM, AND TRAINED A LARGER

ENTERPRISE RESPONSE TEAM OF EXISTING COMPANY EMPLOYEES WHO CAN BE DEPLOYED ON

SHORT NOTICE IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHE THAT GENERATES CLAIM VOLUME EXCEEDING

THE CAPACITY OF THE DEDICATED CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO A

LEADER IN BRINGING EFFECTIVE CLAIM SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE SUPERIOR CUSTOMER

SERVICE. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS

CONCIERGE

CLAIM

SM

, A NEW AUTO CLAIM SERVICE

THAT FEATURES SELECTED

20

INDEPENDENTLY-OWNED

AUTO REPAIR FACILITIES WITH COMPANY APPRAISERS ON SITE TO COMPLETE AN ESTIMATE,

HANDLE ALL RENTAL ARRANGEMENTS AND MONITOR THE REPAIR PROCESS FROM START TO

FINISH. BY MANAGING THE CLAIM IN THIS WAY, THE COMPANY CAN HELP ENSURE PROMPT,

QUALITY RESULTS AND CREATE A DIFFERENTIATED, SUPERIOR CLAIM EXPERIENCE FOR

CUSTOMERS.

ANOTHER STRATEGIC

ADVANTAGE IS TRAVCOMP

SM

,

A WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIM RESOLUTION AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT

ASSISTS ADJUSTERS IN THE PROMPT INVESTIGATION AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS. INNOVATIVE MEDICAL AND CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

TECHNOLOGIES PERMIT NURSE, MEDICAL AND CLAIMS PROFESSIONALS TO SHARE

APPROPRIATE VITAL INFORMATION THAT SUPPORTS PROMPT INVESTIGATION, EFFECTIVE

RETURN TO WORK AND CLAIM RESOLUTION STRATEGIES. THESE TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER

WITH EFFECTIVE MATCHING OF PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND AUTHORITY TO SPECIFIC CLAIM

ISSUES, HAVE RESULTED IN MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION

CLAIMS WITH LOWER MEDICAL, WAGE REPLACEMENT COSTS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY REINSURES A

PORTION OF THE RISKS IT UNDERWRITES IN ORDER TO CONTROL ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES.

THE COMPANY CEDES TO REINSURERS A PORTION OF THESE RISKS AND PAYS PREMIUMS

BASED UPON THE RISK AND EXPOSURE OF THE POLICIES SUBJECT TO SUCH REINSURANCE.

CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES CREDIT RISK, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO MANDATORY POOLS,

AND IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS

LIABLE TO THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF THE REINSURANCE CEDED, THE COMPANY

REMAINS LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED AFTER REDUCTIONS FOR KNOWN INSOLVENCIES AND AFTER

ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS COLLATERAL, INCLUDING

TRUST AGREEMENTS, ESCROW FUNDS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, UNDER CERTAIN REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF REINSURERS ON AN

ONGOING BASIS AND REVIEWS ITS REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS PERIODICALLY. REINSURERS

ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND THE

PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING

REINSURANCE, SEE NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO

LARGE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY LOSSES, INCLUDING.

·

FACULTATIVE

REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE

INSURANCE PROVIDED BY A SINGLE POLICY AND EACH POLICY REINSURED IS SEPARATELY

NEGOTIATED;

·

TREATY

REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR A SPECIFIED TYPE OR CATEGORY

OF RISKS; AND

·

CATASTROPHE

REINSURANCE, IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INDEMNIFIED FOR AN AMOUNT OF LOSS IN

EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED RETENTION WITH RESPECT TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM A

CATASTROPHIC EVENT.

FOR A

DESCRIPTION OF REINSURANCE-RELATED LITIGATION, SEE ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED

BY VARIOUS NATURAL AND MAN-MADE EVENTS INCLUDING HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS,

EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, EXPLOSIONS AND FIRES. THE INCIDENCE

AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT OF LOSSES

FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE

IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST

CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS; HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND

EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE

THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE

TO CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH NONAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO MANAGE

ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM ONE OCCURRENCE. THE COMPANYS GENERAL

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY COVERS THE

21

ACCUMULATION OF NET PROPERTY LOSSES ARISING OUT OF ONE

OCCURRENCE. THE COVERAGE PROVIDED UNDER THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

TREATY, EFFECTIVE FOR THE TIME PERIOD INDICATED, IS AS FOLLOWS.

THIS AGREEMENT EXCLUDES NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL, BIOCHEMICAL

AND RADIOLOGICAL LOSSES AND ALL TERRORISM LOSSES AS DEFINED BY THE TERRORISM

RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 AND THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF

2005. THE AGREEMENT COVERS ALL OF THE COMPANYS EXPOSURES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND CANADA AND THEIR POSSESSIONS AND WATERS CONTIGUOUS THERETO,

THE CARIBBEAN AND MEXICO. FOR BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN CANADA, THE UNITED

KINGDOM, REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND IN THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS,

SEPARATE REINSURANCE PROTECTIONS ARE PURCHASED LOCALLY THAT HAVE LOWER NET

RETENTIONS MORE COMMENSURATE WITH THE SIZE OF THE RESPECTIVE LOCAL BALANCE

SHEET. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS AN ONGOING REVIEW OF ITS RISK AND CATASTROPHE

COVERAGES AND MAKES CHANGES AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

IN ADDITION TO ITS GENERAL

CATASTROPHE TREATY, THE COMPANY ALSO IS PARTY TO A NORTHEAST GENERAL

CATASTROPHE TREATY PROVIDING $500 MILLION OF COVERAGE, SUBJECT TO A $2.25

BILLION RETENTION, FOR LOSSES ARISING FROM HURRICANES, EARTHQUAKES AND WINTER

STORM OR FREEZE LOSSES FROM VIRGINIA TO MAINE, AND WATERS CONTIGUOUS THERETO.

LOSSES FROM A COVERED EVENT (OCCURRING OVER SEVERAL DAYS) ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED

STATES MAY BE USED TO SATISFY THE RETENTION.

FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND

(FHCF)

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES

IN THE FHCF, WHICH IS A STATE-MANDATED CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE FUND THAT

PROVIDES REIMBURSEMENT TO INSURERS FOR A PORTION OF THEIR RESIDENTIAL

CATASTROPHIC HURRICANE LOSSES. THE FHCF IS PRIMARILY FUNDED BY PREMIUMS FROM

INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WRITE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY BUSINESS IN FLORIDA AND, IF

INSUFFICIENT, ASSESSMENTS ON ALL FLORIDA

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY LINES OF BUSINESS, EXCLUDING ACCIDENT AND HEALTH,

THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM, WORKERS COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE INSURANCE. THE FHCFS RESOURCES ARE LIMITED TO THESE CONTRIBUTIONS

AND TO ITS BORROWING CAPACITY AT THE TIME OF A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE IN

FLORIDA. BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTED REIMBURSEMENTS FOR 2004 AND 2005 LOSSES, THE

STATE OF FLORIDA LEVIED A 1% ASSESSMENT EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007 FOR ALL

OF THE COMPANYS RELEVANT POLICYHOLDERS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE COMPANY HOLDS

NO LIABILITY FOR THIS PASS-THROUGH ASSESSMENT, SINCE THE COMPANY IS ONLY LIABLE

FOR THE ASSESSMENTS COLLECTED FROM INSUREDS. PRIOR TO THE SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE

SESSION IN FLORIDA IN JANUARY 2007, THE PROJECTED FHCF BONDING FOR FUTURE

EVENTS WAS ADEQUATE TO COVER ITS STATUTORY CAPACITY. IN JANUARY 2007, THE

GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA SIGNED INTO LAW LEGISLATION WHICH EXPANDED THE CAPACITY OF

THE FHCF FROM $16 BILLION TO $28 BILLION, WITH AN OPTION FOR THE FHCF BOARD OF

GOVERNORS TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL $4 BILLION OF CAPACITY. ADDITIONALLY,

PARTICIPATING COMPANIES HAVE THE OPTION TO SELECT LOWER ATTACHMENT POINTS TO

THE FHCF IN $1 BILLION INCREMENTS RANGING FROM $6 BILLION TO $3 BILLION. AS A

RESULT, THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL INDUSTRY CAPACITY HAS BEEN INCREASED FROM

APPROXIMATELY $16 BILLION TO $35 BILLION FOR A SINGLE HURRICANE EVENT IMPACTING

FLORIDA RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY EXPOSURES. THE COMPANYS PARTICIPATION AS OF

JUNE 2006 (THE MOST RECENT DATE FOR WHICH DATA IS AVAILABLE) ACCOUNTED FOR

LESS THAN 0.8% OF THE FHCF. THIS ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IS ALSO FUNDED PRIMARILY

BY PREMIUMS AND RELIES ON THE SAME ASSESSMENT AND BORROWING PROCESS DESCRIBED

ABOVE. IF THERE ARE HURRICANES IN 2007, THE CASH RESOURCES OF THE FHCF MAY NOT

BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINUING ASSESSMENTS MAY BE

NECESSARY.

22

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002

AND TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, THE TERRORISM RISK

INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 (THE TERRORISM ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW AND

ESTABLISHED THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM), A TEMPORARY

FEDERAL PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY THAT PROVIDED FOR A SYSTEM OF

SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS

OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN INTEREST. THE PROGRAM

WAS SCHEDULED TO TERMINATE ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005,

THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005 (THE TERRORISM EXTENSION

ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW, REAUTHORIZING THE PROGRAM THROUGH DECEMBER 31,

2007, WHILE REDUCING THE FEDERAL ROLE UNDER THE PROGRAM.

IN ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM

(SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS

THAT VARY BY PROGRAM YEAR OF AMOUNTS $100 MILLION OR LESS, AND MUST BE THE

RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S.

SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION

CERTAIN OF THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE: FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE, PRIVATE

MORTGAGE INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

INSURANCE, HEALTH OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE. THE

TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT EXEMPTED FROM COVERAGE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL TYPES OF

INSURANCE, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY (OTHER THAN

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS), SURETY, BURGLARY AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS

MULTI-PERIL. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS

COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE TERRORISM ACT AND THE TERRORISM

EXTENSION ACT. BOTH ACTS GENERALLY REQUIRE THAT ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY

CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM.

UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR A PERCENTAGE OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE,

SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP. THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT PERCENTAGE IS 85% IN 2007.

THE DEDUCTIBLE IS

CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE DEDUCTIBLE PERCENTAGE TO THE INSURERS DIRECT EARNED

PREMIUMS FOR COVERED LINES FROM THE CALENDAR YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE

YEAR. THE DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM WAS 10% FOR 2004, 15% FOR 2005, 17.5%

FOR 2006 AND WILL BE 20% FOR 2007. THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE

PROGRAM IS $2.20 BILLION FOR 2007. THE ANNUAL CAP LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF

AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE

SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE $100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, CONGRESS

SHALL DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF FUNDS, IF ANY, AVAILABLE FOR LOSSES THAT EXCEED

THE $100 BILLION CAP. THE COMPANY HAD NO TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES IN 2006, 2005

OR 2004. IF THE PROGRAM IS NOT RENEWED FOR PERIODS AFTER JANUARY 1, 2008,

THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY, AND THE

COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM SUBJECT ONLY TO THE

TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES WRITTEN IN 2007

FOR WHICH THE PERIOD OF COVERAGE EXTENDS INTO 2008. GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE

FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM

COVERAGE IN THE COMPANYS OWN REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF

TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR

RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE PERIODS, PARTICULARLY IF THE

PROGRAM IS NOT EXTENDED. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE TERRORISM ACT IS EXTENDED,

THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THIS TYPE OF CATASTROPHIC RISK BY

MONITORING AND CONTROLLING TERRORISM RISK AGGREGATIONS TO THE BEST OF ITS

ABILITY.

CLAIM AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS

RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES

AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT

HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED.

MANAGEMENT CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS RESERVE ESTIMATES

IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS THAT INCLUDES REVIEW OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS,

UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS

ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH

THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, THE COMPANY TAKES INTO

ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FOR REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.

23

THE RESERVES ARE ALSO

REVIEWED REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING RESERVES AND A DISCUSSION OF UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND

RISK FACTORS, SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES.

THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A

HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES THE CONSIDERATION OF A NUMBER OF

VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES (DISCUSSED BY PRODUCT LINE IN THE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION) ARE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL

EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, INFLATION, JUDICIAL

TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS

ON ULTIMATE COSTS OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO

ESTIMATE. RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT

LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE UNDERLYING INSURANCE CONTRACT (E.G., CLAIMS MADE

VERSUS OCCURRENCE), CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL

SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, DETERMINING THE OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM, AND

REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INSURED EVENT AND WHEN

IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED

THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES

ESTIMATES FOR UNREPORTED CLAIMS AND DEVELOPMENT ON REPORTED CLAIMS PRINCIPALLY

FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT BY ACCIDENT

YEAR FOR EACH TYPE OF EXPOSURE AND BUSINESS UNIT. SIMILARLY, THE COMPANY

DERIVES ESTIMATES OF UNPAID LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL

ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO LOSSES FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AND TYPE OF EXPOSURE.

FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANYS RESERVING METHODS FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION,

AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

DISCOUNTING

INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ARE CERTAIN

RESERVES DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE

LIABILITIES FOR LOSSES FOR SOME LONG-TERM DISABILITY PAYMENTS UNDER WORKERS

COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE, WHICH

TOTALED $1.98 BILLION AND $1.92 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND

2005. RESERVES RELATED TO CERTAIN FIXED AND DETERMINABLE ASBESTOS-RELATED

SETTLEMENTS, WHERE ALL PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND THEIR TIMING ARE KNOWN, TOTALED $34

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 2.6% AT

THAT DATE. THERE WERE NO SUCH RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. RESERVES FOR

CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 7% AND A

RANGE OF RATES FROM 5% TO 7.5%, AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, AND TOTALED $37 MILLION AND $79 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE DEVELOPMENT TABLE

THE TABLE ON PAGE 26 SETS FORTH THE YEAR-END

RESERVES FROM 1996 THROUGH 2006 AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THOSE RESERVES,

PRESENTED ON A HISTORICAL BASIS. THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS

PAID AND REESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR THE YEARS 1996 THROUGH 2003 HAVE

NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE ACQUISITION OF SPC IN 2004. THE TABLE INCLUDES

SPC RESERVES BEGINNING AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND

REESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR THE YEARS 1996 TO 2000

HAVE

ALSO NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE ACQUISITION OF NORTHLAND AND COMMERCIAL

GUARANTY CASUALTY. BEGINNING IN 2001, THE TABLE INCLUDES THE RESERVE ACTIVITY

OF NORTHLAND AND COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY. THE DATA IN THE TABLE IS

PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO AVOID MISINTERPRETATION BY

THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS INFORMATION OR FAMILIAR WITH OTHER DATA COMMONLY

REPORTED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE ACCOMPANYING DATA IS NOT ACCIDENT YEAR

DATA, BUT RATHER A DISPLAY OF 1996 TO 2006 YEAR-END RESERVES AND THE SUBSEQUENT

CHANGES IN THOSE RESERVES.

24

FOR INSTANCE, THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY (REDUNDANCY)

SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE FOR EACH YEAR REPRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT

BY WHICH ORIGINAL ESTIMATES OF RESERVES AS OF THAT YEAR-END HAVE CHANGED IN

SUBSEQUENT YEARS. ACCORDINGLY, THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY FOR A YEAR RELATES

ONLY TO RESERVES AT THAT YEAR-END AND THOSE AMOUNTS ARE NOT ADDITIVE. EXPRESSED

ANOTHER WAY, IF THE ORIGINAL RESERVES AT THE END OF 1996 INCLUDED $4 MILLION

FOR A LOSS THAT IS FINALLY PAID IN 2005 FOR $5 MILLION, THE $1 MILLION

DEFICIENCY (THE EXCESS OF THE ACTUAL PAYMENT OF $5 MILLION OVER THE ORIGINAL

ESTIMATE OF $4 MILLION) WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES IN EACH

OF THE YEARS 1996 TO 2004 SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

VARIOUS FACTORS MAY DISTORT THE RE-ESTIMATED RESERVES

AND CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY OR REDUNDANCY SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE. FOR

EXAMPLE, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES SHOWN IN THE

ACCOMPANYING TABLE ARISE FROM CLAIMS ON POLICIES WRITTEN PRIOR TO THE MID-1970S

INVOLVING LIABILITY EXPOSURES SUCH AS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN THE

POST-1984 PERIOD, THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED MORE STRINGENT UNDERWRITING

STANDARDS AND POLICY EXCLUSIONS AND HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRACTED OR TERMINATED

THE WRITING OF THESE RISKS. SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION,

AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

GENERAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF

THESE LIABILITIES IN THE PAST WILL NOT NECESSARILY RECUR IN THE FUTURE.

OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE DATA IN THE ACCOMPANYING

TABLE INCLUDE THE DISCOUNTING OF CERTAIN RESERVES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, AND THE

USE OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED INSURANCE POLICIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WORKERS

COMPENSATION INDEMNITY RESERVES (TABULAR RESERVES) ARE DISCOUNTED TO REFLECT

THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. APPARENT DEFICIENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AS THE

DISCOUNT ON THESE WORKERS COMPENSATION RESERVES IS ACCRETED AT THE APPROPRIATE

INTEREST RATES. ALSO, A PORTION OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN

WITH RETROSPECTIVELY RATED INSURANCE POLICIES IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE LOSS

EXPERIENCE IS PRIMARILY BORNE BY THE INSURED. FOR THIS BUSINESS, INCREASES IN

LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING INCREASE IN

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM INSUREDS. LIKEWISE, DECREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE

RESULT IN A DECREASE IN RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING DECREASE IN AMOUNTS

RECOVERABLE FROM THESE INSUREDS. THE AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON THESE

RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CUMULATIVE

DEFICIENCIES OR REDUNDANCIES ON THE COMPANYS EARNINGS BUT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

25

BECAUSE

OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL

EXTRAPOLATION OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REDUNDANCIES OR DEFICIENCIES IN LOSS RESERVES

FROM THE DATA IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

(A)

INCLUDES RESERVES OF THE NORTHLAND COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AND COMMERCIAL GUARANTY LLOYDS INSURANCE COMPANY WHICH WERE

ACQUIRED FROM CITIGROUP ON OCTOBER 1, 2001. ALSO INCLUDES RESERVES OF

COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH WAS CONTRIBUTED TO TPC BY

CITIGROUP ON OCTOBER 3, 2001. AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, THESE GROSS

RESERVES WERE $867 MILLION, AND NET RESERVES WERE $633 MILLION.

(B)

FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2004, EXCLUDES SPC

RESERVES, WHICH WERE ACQUIRED ON APRIL 1, 2004. ACCORDINGLY, THE RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT (NET RESERVES FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES REESTIMATED

AS OF SUBSEQUENT YEARS LESS NET RESERVES RECORDED AT THE END OF THE YEAR, AS

ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED) FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2004 RELATES ONLY TO LOSSES RECORDED

BY TPC AND DOES NOT INCLUDE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED BY SPC. FOR 2004 AND

SUBSEQUENT YEARS, INCLUDES SPC RESERVES AND SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT RECORDED BY

SPC. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, SPC GROSS RESERVES WERE $23,274 MILLION AND NET

RESERVES WERE $15,959 MILLION.

RESERVES ON

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

2005 AND 2004, CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (NET OF REINSURANCE)

SHOWN IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP), WERE $104 MILLION, $296 MILLION AND $282

MILLION LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN THOSE REPORTED IN THE COMPANYS RESPECTIVE

ANNUAL REPORTS FILED WITH INSURANCE REGULATORS, WHICH ARE PREPARED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. THE ACCOUNTING FOR RETROACTIVE

REINSURANCE IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE DIFFERENCE IN RESERVES. RETROACTIVE

REINSURANCE BALANCES RESULT FROM REINSURANCE PLACED TO COVER LOSSES ON INSURED

EVENTS OCCURRING PRIOR TO THE CONTRACT INCEPTION. FOR GAAP REPORTING,

RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES ARE INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND

RESULT IN LOWER NET RESERVE AMOUNTS. STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES REQUIRE

RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES TO BE RECORDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES AS

CONTRA-LIABILITIES RATHER THAN IN LOSS RESERVES.

ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS ARE SEGREGATED FROM OTHER CLAIMS AND ARE HANDLED SEPARATELY BY THE

COMPANYS SPECIAL LIABILITY GROUP, A SEPARATE UNIT STAFFED BY DEDICATED LEGAL,

CLAIM, FINANCE AND ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INTERCOMPANY

REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

MOST OF THE COMPANYS

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE MEMBERS OF INTERCOMPANY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE

POOLING ARRANGEMENTS. POOLING ARRANGEMENTS PERMIT THE PARTICIPATING COMPANIES

TO RELY ON THE CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE POOLS CAPITAL AND SURPLUS RATHER THAN

JUST ON ITS OWN CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, THE MEMBERS SHARE

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INSURANCE BUSINESS THAT IS WRITTEN, AND ALLOCATE THE COMBINED

PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES. DURING 2005, THE COMPANY COMBINED THE PREVIOUSLY

SEPARATE ST. PAUL INSURANCE GROUP AND TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY POOLS,

FORMING THE NEW ST. PAUL TRAVELERS REINSURANCE POOL. TRAVELERS INDEMNITY

COMPANY IS THE LEAD COMPANY OF THE NEW POOL, WHICH INCLUDES 28 COMPANIES. THE

COMPANY ALSO MERGED GULF INSURANCE COMPANY, THE LEAD COMPANY OF THE FORMER GULF

INSURANCE GROUP, INTO TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE WERE TWO INTERCOMPANY POOLING ARRANGEMENTS.

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS REINSURANCE POOL AND THE NORTHLAND POOL.

27

RATINGS

RATINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SETTING THE COMPANYS

COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE INSURANCE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY RECEIVES RATINGS

FROM THE FOLLOWING MAJOR RATING AGENCIES: A.M. BEST COMPANY (A.M. BEST),

FITCH RATINGS (FITCH), MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODYS) AND STANDARD &

POORS CORP. (S&P). RATING AGENCIES TYPICALLY ISSUE TWO TYPES OF RATINGS.

CLAIMS-PAYING (OR FINANCIAL STRENGTH) RATINGS WHICH ASSESS AN INSURERS ABILITY

TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND DEBT RATINGS WHICH

ASSESS A COMPANYS PROSPECTS FOR REPAYING ITS DEBTS AND ASSIST LENDERS IN

SETTING INTEREST RATES AND TERMS FOR A COMPANYS SHORT AND LONG TERM BORROWING

NEEDS. AGENCY RATINGS ARE NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY, SELL OR HOLD ANY

SECURITY, AND THEY MAY BE REVISED OR WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME BY THE RATING

ORGANIZATION. EACH AGENCYS RATING SHOULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY

OTHER AGENCYS RATING. THE SYSTEM AND THE NUMBER OF RATING CATEGORIES CAN VARY

WIDELY FROM RATING AGENCY TO RATING AGENCY. CUSTOMERS USUALLY FOCUS ON

CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS, WHILE CREDITORS FOCUS ON DEBT RATINGS. INVESTORS USE

BOTH TO EVALUATE A COMPANYS OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH. THE RATINGS ISSUED ON

THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES BY ANY OF THESE AGENCIES ARE ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY

AND ARE AVAILABLE ON THE COMPANYS WEBSITE AND FROM THE AGENCIES.

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, THERE COULD BE A

REDUCED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY, THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD BE IMPACTED AND HIGHER

BORROWING COSTS MAY BE INCURRED.

INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF

FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO

OF HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID INTERMEDIATE-TERM TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, CORPORATE

AND MORTGAGE BACKED BONDS

30

AND

TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE DURATION OF

ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES ARE EXECUTED

WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE COMPANYS

INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT OF THE DURATION OF THE

FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO GENERALLY PRODUCES A DURATION THAT MODESTLY EXCEEDS

THE DURATION OF THE COMPANYS NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES.

THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE

COMPANYS ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS ARE TO SATISFY THE INSURANCE

LIABILITIES, MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK EMBEDDED IN THOSE INSURANCE

LIABILITIES, AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER FLUCTUATIONS IN

PROJECTED LIABILITY CASH FLOWS. GENERALLY, THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST

PAYMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANYS FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO ADEQUATELY FUND THE

ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT AN

EXACT CASH FLOW MATCH IN EACH PERIOD, THE SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE BY WHICH THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE NET

INSURANCE LIABILITIES, PLUS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND

THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS PROVIDES ASSURANCE OF THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO FUND THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR

ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES.

THE COMPANY ALSO INVESTS

MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, VENTURE CAPITAL AND REAL ESTATE.

THESE INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT ALSO INVOLVE

VARYING DEGREES OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND LESS

LIQUIDITY.

SEE NOTE 3 OF NOTES TO THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

DERIVATIVES

NOTES TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THE POLICIES AND TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS.

REGULATION

STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION

STAS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE VARIOUS STATES AND JURISDICTIONS

IN WHICH THEY TRANSACT BUSINESS. THE EXTENT OF REGULATION VARIES, BUT GENERALLY

DERIVES FROM STATUTES THAT DELEGATE REGULATORY, SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE

AUTHORITY TO A DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN EACH STATE. THE REGULATION,

SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION RELATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO STANDARDS OF

SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED, THE LICENSING OF INSURERS AND THEIR

AGENTS, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS, PREMIUM RATES,

RESTRICTIONS ON THE SIZE OF RISKS THAT MAY BE INSURED UNDER A SINGLE POLICY,

RESERVES AND PROVISIONS FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS,

DEPOSITS OF SECURITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF POLICYHOLDERS, APPROVAL OF POLICY

FORMS AND THE REGULATION OF MARKET CONDUCT, INCLUDING THE USE OF CREDIT

INFORMATION IN UNDERWRITING AS WELL AS OTHER UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PRACTICES.

IN ADDITION, MANY STATES HAVE ENACTED VARIATIONS OF COMPETITIVE RATEMAKING

LAWS, WHICH ALLOW INSURERS TO SET CERTAIN PREMIUM RATES FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF

INSURANCE WITHOUT HAVING TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE STATE INSURANCE

DEPARTMENT. STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS ALSO CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND MARKET CONDUCT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND REQUIRE

THE FILING OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER REPORTS ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS. STAS

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE COLLECTIVELY LICENSED TO TRANSACT INSURANCE BUSINESS

IN ALL STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, GUAM, PUERTO RICO, BERMUDA AND THE

U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.

AGENT AND BROKER COMPENSATION

AS PART OF ONGOING,

INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING 21

STATES AND THE SEC. THE AREAS OF INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE

METHOD BY WHICH BROKERS AND AGENTS ARE COMPENSATED. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING

WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. AS

31

DESCRIBED IN MORE

DETAIL IN PART I, ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS HEREIN, IN AUGUST 2006,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH SEVERAL OF THESE STATES TO RESOLVE

ISSUES RELATED TO BROKER AND AGENT COMPENSATION. THE COMPANY DISCONTINUED PAYING CONTINGENT COMMISSIONS

ON EXCESS CASUALTY AND UMBRELLA BUSINESS EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY DISCONTINUED PAYING CONTINGENT COMMISSIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS

MULTI-PERIL, PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE PHYSICAL DAMAGE, PRIVATE PASSENGER

AUTOMOBILE NO-FAULT, OTHER PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY, BOILER AND

MACHINERY AND FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE LINES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007.

THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR THESE LINES

OF BUSINESS THAT COMPENSATE BROKERS AND AGENTS IN A MANNER THAT DIFFERENTIATES

FOR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS. BEGINNING

JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY IS OFFERING AN OPTIONAL FIXED COMMISSION PROGRAM

FOR MOST COMMERCIAL INSURANCE LINES.

INSURANCE REGULATION CONCERNING

DIVIDENDS

STAS PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED

IN THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT AND MINNESOTA. THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS

OF BOTH STATES APPLICABLE TO STAS SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRE NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL

BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY

DIVIDEND, THAT TOGETHER WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING

TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURERS CAPITAL AND SURPLUS

AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURERS NET INCOME FOR THE

TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE

DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND BY STATE

REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED

UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES.

THE INSURANCE HOLDING

COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH STAS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE

RESTRICTIVE, LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

PREMIUM RATE APPROVALS

STAS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO EACH STATES REGULATIONS REGARDING PREMIUM RATE

APPROVALS. THE APPLICABLE REGULATIONS ARE USED BY STATES TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS

TO ENSURE THAT RATES ARE NOT EXCESSIVE, INADEQUATE, UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY, OR

USED TO ENGAGE IN UNFAIR PRICE COMPETITION. AN INSURERS ABILITY TO INCREASE

PREMIUMS AND THE RELATIVE TIMING OF THE PROCESS, ARE DEPENDENT UPON EACH

RESPECTIVE STATES REQUIREMENTS.

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXITING GEOGRAPHIC

MARKETS AND/OR CANCELING OR NONRENEWING POLICIES

SEVERAL STATES HAVE

REGULATIONS WHICH MAY IMPACT THE TIMING AND/OR THE ABILITY OF AN INSURER TO

EITHER DISCONTINUE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE ITS WRITINGS IN THAT STATE. THESE

REGULATIONS TYPICALLY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE, AND IN SOME INSTANCES INSURANCE

DEPARTMENT APPROVAL, PRIOR TO DISCONTINUING A LINE OF BUSINESS OR WITHDRAWING

FROM THAT STATE.

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, STA

IS NOT REGULATED AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. HOWEVER, SINCE STA OWNS CAPITAL STOCK

IN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, IT IS SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY

STATUTES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER LAWS, OF EACH OF ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

STATES OF DOMICILE. ALL HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS OTHER LAWS,

REQUIRE DISCLOSURE AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, PRIOR APPROVAL OF MATERIAL

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND AN AFFILIATE. THE HOLDING COMPANY

STATUTES AND OTHER LAWS ALSO REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PRIOR APPROVAL OF AN

ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF A DOMESTIC INSURER, SOME TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN

AFFILIATES AND THE PAYMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS.

32

INSURANCE REGULATIONS CONCERNING

CHANGE OF CONTROL

MANY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY LAWS CONTAIN

PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE ADVANCE APPROVAL BY STATE AGENCIES OF ANY CHANGE IN

CONTROL OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT IS DOMICILED, OR, IN SOME CASES, HAVING

SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS THAT IT IS DEEMED TO BE COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED, IN THAT

STATE.

THE LAWS OF MANY STATES ALSO CONTAIN PROVISIONS

REQUIRING PRE-NOTIFICATION TO STATE AGENCIES PRIOR TO ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF

A NON-DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY ADMITTED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN THAT STATE.

WHILE THESE PRE-NOTIFICATION STATUTES DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE STATE AGENCY TO

DISAPPROVE THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, THEY DO AUTHORIZE ISSUANCE OF CEASE AND

DESIST ORDERS WITH RESPECT TO THE NON-DOMESTIC INSURER IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT

SOME CONDITIONS, SUCH AS UNDUE MARKET CONCENTRATION, WOULD RESULT FROM THE

ACQUISITION.

ANY TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN

CONTROL OF ANY OF STAS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD GENERALLY REQUIRE PRIOR

APPROVAL BY THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATES IN WHICH THE INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED OR COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED. THEY MAY ALSO REQUIRE

PREACQUISITION NOTIFICATION IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED PREACQUISITION

NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS AND IN WHICH SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ADMITTED

TO TRANSACT BUSINESS.

ONE OF STAS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND ITS OPERATIONS

AT LLOYDS ARE DOMICILED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. INSURERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND

MARKETS ACT OF 2000 INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. INSURERS

IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE IRISH FINANCIAL

SERVICES REGULATORY AUTHORITY.

SOME OF STAS OTHER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

DOMICILED IN, OR AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT INSURANCE BUSINESS IN, CANADA.

AUTHORIZED INSURERS IN CANADA ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 407

OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT, INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE OFFICE OF THE

SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY

DETER, DELAY OR PREVENT TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING THE CONTROL OF OR THE OWNERSHIP

OF COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO STAS

SHAREHOLDERS.

ASSESSMENTS FOR

GUARANTY FUNDS AND SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

VIRTUALLY ALL STATES REQUIRE INSURERS LICENSED TO DO

BUSINESS IN THEIR STATE TO BEAR A PORTION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED BY SOME INSUREDS

BECAUSE OF THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURERS. MANY STATES ALSO HAVE LAWS THAT

ESTABLISHED SECOND-INJURY FUNDS TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO INJURED EMPLOYEES

FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRIOR CONDITION OR INJURY.

STAS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNED

RISK POOLS, PRINCIPALLY INVOLVING WORKERS COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOBILE

INSURANCE, WHICH PROVIDE VARIOUS INSURANCE COVERAGES TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER

ENTITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE THAT COVERAGE IN THE VOLUNTARY

MARKET.

INSURANCE

REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS

(NAIC) DEVELOPED THE INSURANCE REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM (IRIS) TO HELP

STATE REGULATORS IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION. FINANCIAL

EXAMINERS REVIEW ANNUAL STATEMENTS AND KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS BASED ON YEAR-END

DATA. THESE RATIOS ASSIST STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS IN EXECUTING THEIR STATUTORY

MANDATE TO OVERSEE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. EACH RATIO

HAS AN ESTABLISHED USUAL RANGE OF RESULTS. A RATIO RESULT FALLING OUTSIDE THE

USUAL RANGE OF IRIS RATIOS, HOWEVER, IS NOT CONSIDERED A FAILING RESULT;

RATHER, UNUSUAL VALUES ARE VIEWED AS PART OF THE REGULATORY EARLY MONITORING

SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, IN SOME YEARS, IT MAY NOT BE UNUSUAL FOR FINANCIALLY SOUND

COMPANIES TO HAVE SEVERAL RATIOS WITH RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES.

33

GENERALLY, AN INSURANCE

COMPANY WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY IF IT FALLS OUTSIDE THE

USUAL RANGES OF FOUR OR MORE OF THE RATIOS.

BASED ON PRELIMINARY 2006 IRIS RATIOS CALCULATED BY

THE COMPANY, DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE

FOR TWO OF THE IRIS RATIOS, DUE TO RESERVE STRENGTHENING ACTIONS TAKEN IN 2005.

IN 2005, MOST OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS

REINSURANCE POOL HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE OF THE IRIS

RATIOS, DUE TO RESERVE STRENGTHENING ACTIONS THAT OCCURRED IN 2004 AND THE

COMBINING OF THE TWO POOLS THAT OCCURRED IN 2005. IN ADDITION, DISCOVER

REINSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THREE OF THE IRIS

RATIOS, DUE TO RESERVE STRENGTHENING ACTIONS IN 2005 AND 2004.

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE REGULATORY ACTION AS A RESULT OF THE 2006 IRIS RATIO RESULTS. IN ALL

INSTANCES IN PRIOR YEARS, REGULATORS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED UPON FOLLOW-UP THAT NO

REGULATORY ACTION WAS REQUIRED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SIMILAR RESULTS COULD OCCUR

IN THE FUTURE. NO STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN ANY REGULATORY ACTION

WITH RESPECT TO THE IRIS RATIOS OF ANY OF STAS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES FOR THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

(RBC) REQUIREMENTS

THE NAIC HAS AN RBC REQUIREMENT FOR MOST PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE RBC REQUIREMENT DETERMINES MINIMUM CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS AND IS INTENDED TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR POLICYHOLDER

OBLIGATIONS. UNDER LAWS ADOPTED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES, INSURERS HAVING TOTAL

ADJUSTED CAPITAL LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED BY THE RBC CALCULATION WILL BE SUBJECT

TO VARYING DEGREES OF REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL

INADEQUACY.

THE FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN

DESIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE AMONG ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE

WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE

TO USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, ALL OF STAS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN EXCESS

OF THE RBC REQUIREMENT.

INVESTMENT

REGULATION

INSURANCE COMPANY

INVESTMENTS MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH PRESCRIBE

THE KIND, QUALITY AND CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS. IN GENERAL, THESE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS PERMIT INVESTMENTS IN FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS,

CORPORATE BONDS, PREFERRED AND COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES, MORTGAGE LOANS, REAL

ESTATE AND CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENTS, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED LIMITS AND CERTAIN

OTHER QUALIFICATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL

REGULATION

STAS INSURANCE UNDERWRITING

SUBSIDIARY BASED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, ST. PAUL TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY

LIMITED, IS REGULATED BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA). THE FSAS

PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES ARE TO MAINTAIN MARKET CONFIDENCE, PROMOTE PUBLIC

UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, PROTECT CONSUMERS, AND TO FIGHT

FINANCIAL CRIME. STAS LLOYDS SYNDICATES ARE ALSO REGULATED BY THE FSA, WHICH

HAS DELEGATED CERTAIN REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE COUNCIL OF LLOYDS.

THROUGH LLOYDS, STA IS LICENSED TO WRITE BUSINESS IN OVER 70 COUNTRIES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BY VIRTUE OF LLOYDS INTERNATIONAL LICENSES. IN EACH SUCH

COUNTRY STA IS SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND INSURANCE REGULATION OF THAT COUNTRY. IN

CANADA, THE CONDUCT OF STAS INSURANCE BUSINESS IS REGULATED UNDER PROVISIONS

OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT, WHICH REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN

CERTAIN LEVELS OF CAPITAL DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSURANCE

POLICIES IN FORCE. IN AUSTRALIA, STAS BRANCH IN RUNOFF IS REGULATED BY THE

AUSTRALIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY.

CONCENTRATION

IN THE OPINION OF THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, NO MATERIAL PART OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS

AND NO ONE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF AFFILIATED CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTS FOR AS MUCH AS

10% OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED REVENUES.

THE LIVES OF TWO OR MORE PERSONS OR FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME.

ASSIGNED RISK POOLS

REINSURANCE POOLS

WHICH COVER RISKS FOR THOSE UNABLE TO PURCHASE INSURANCE IN THE VOLUNTARY

OR THE PROFIT BEING TOO SMALL UNDER THE REQUIRED INSURANCE RATE STRUCTURE.

THE COSTS OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE POOLS ARE CHARGED BACK TO

ASSUMED REINSURANCE

INSURANCE RISKS

AVERAGE VALUE METHOD

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD USED

TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT

YEAR/PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED

FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID

LOSSES.

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE

METHOD IS THAT AVERAGE CLAIM VALUES ARE STABLE AND PREDICTABLE OVER TIME FOR

A PARTICULAR COHORT OF CLAIMS. THE METHOD IS UTILIZED MOST OFTEN WHERE

ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS ARE KNOWN OR RELIABLY ESTIMABLE FAIRLY EARLY AFTER THE

START OF AN ACCIDENT YEAR AND AVERAGE VALUES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FAIRLY

PREDICTABLE FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT.

ULTIMATE LOSSES UNDER

THE METHOD EQUAL THE KNOWN OR ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS TIMES THE

ESTIMATED AVERAGE VALUE. ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS ARE FREQUENTLY BASED

ON A CLAIM COUNT DEVELOPMENT METHOD, ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THE PAID AND

CASE INCURRED DEVELOPMENT METHODS MENTIONED ELSEWHERE IN THIS GLOSSARY BUT

USING CLAIM COUNT RATHER THAN CLAIM DOLLAR DATA. THE AVERAGE VALUES CAN BE

BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS FROM PAST CLOSED CLAIMS, OR BACKED INTO FROM

ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES DIVIDED BY ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS, OR SOME

OTHER APPROACH. WHEN THE AVERAGE VALUES ARE CALCULATED FROM ULTIMATE LOSS

ESTIMATES, THE RESULTING ESTIMATED AVERAGES MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH OTHER

DATA/ANALYSES.

36

BORNHEUTTER-FERGUSON METHOD

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD TO

ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT

YEAR/PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED

FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE

OUTSTANDING LOSSES.

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE

METHOD IS THAT THE HISTORICAL RATIO OF ADDITIONAL CLAIM ACTIVITY TO EARNED

PREMIUM FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT/AGE-TO-AGE PERIOD IS STABLE AND

PREDICTABLE. IT IMPLICITLY ASSUMES THAT THE ACTUAL ACTIVITY TO-DATE FOR PAST

PERIODS FOR THAT COHORT IS NOT A CREDIBLE PREDICTOR OF FUTURE ACTIVITY FOR

THAT COHORT, OR AT LEAST IS NOT CREDIBLE ENOUGH TO OVERRIDE THE A PRIORI

ASSUMPTION AS TO FUTURE ACTIVITY. IT MAY BE APPLIED TO EITHER PAID OR CASE

INCURRED CLAIM DATA. IT IS USED MOST OFTEN WHERE THE CLAIM DATA IS SPARSE

AND/OR VOLATILE AND FOR RELATIVELY YOUNG COHORTS WITH LOW VOLUMES AND/OR DATA

CREDIBILITY.

TO ILLUSTRATE, THE

METHOD MAY ASSUME THAT THE RATIO OF ADDITIONAL PAID LOSSES FROM THE 12 TO 24

MONTH PERIOD FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR IS 10% OF THE ORIGINAL A PRIORI EXPECTED

LOSSES FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR. THE ORIGINAL A PRIORI EXPECTED LOSSES ARE

TYPICALLY BASED ON THE ORIGINAL LOSS RATIO ASSUMPTION FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR,

WITH SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENT AS FACTS DEVELOP.

THE ULTIMATE LOSSES

EQUAL ACTUAL ACTIVITY TO-DATE PLUS THE EXPECTED VALUES FOR FUTURE PERIODS.

BROKER

ONE WHO NEGOTIATES

THE PERCENTAGE OF

SURPLUS, OR THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE, THAT AN INSURER OR REINSURER IS

WILLING OR ABLE TO PLACE AT RISK. CAPACITY MAY APPLY TO A SINGLE RISK, A

PROGRAM, A LINE OF BUSINESS OR AN ENTIRE BOOK OF BUSINESS. CAPACITY MAY BE

CONSTRAINED BY LEGAL RESTRICTIONS, CORPORATE RESTRICTIONS OR INDIRECT

RESTRICTIONS.

CAPTIVE

A CLOSELY-HELD INSURANCE

COMPANY WHOSE PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THE COMPANYS

CASE INCURRED LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS

SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES

ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION

OF THE UNPAID LOSSES.

THE APPROACH IS THE SAME

AS THAT DESCRIBED IN THIS GLOSSARY UNDER THE PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD,

BUT BASED ON THE GROWTH IN CUMULATIVE CASE INCURRED LOSSES (I.E., THE SUM OF

CLAIM-ADJUSTOR INCURRED ESTIMATES FOR CLAIMS IN THE COHORT) RATHER THAN PAID

LOSSES. THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT CUMULATIVE CASE INCURRED

LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS WILL GROW IN A STABLE, PREDICTABLE

PATTERN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR, BASED ON THE AGE OF THE COHORT.

CASE RESERVES

CLAIM DEPARTMENT

ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE PAYMENTS TO BE MADE ON EACH SPECIFIC

CASUALTY INSURANCE

INSURANCE WHICH IS

PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE LOSSES CAUSED BY INJURIES TO THIRD PERSONS,

I.E., NOT THE INSURED, AND THE LEGAL LIABILITY IMPOSED ON THE INSURED

RESULTING THEREFROM. IT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, EMPLOYERS

LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, PUBLIC LIABILITY, AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY,

PERSONAL LIABILITY AND AVIATION LIABILITY INSURANCE. IT EXCLUDES CERTAIN

TYPES OF LOSSES THAT BY LAW OR CUSTOM ARE CONSIDERED AS BEING EXCLUSIVELY

WITHIN THE SCOPE OF OTHER TYPES OF INSURANCE, SUCH AS FIRE OR MARINE.

CATASTROPHE

A SEVERE LOSS, RESULTING

FROM NATURAL AND MANMADE EVENTS, INCLUDING RISKS SUCH AS FIRE, EARTHQUAKE,

WINDSTORM, EXPLOSION, TERRORISM AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. EACH CATASTROPHE

HAS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS. CATASTROPHES ARE NOT PREDICTABLE AS TO TIMING OR

AMOUNT IN ADVANCE, AND THEREFORE THEIR EFFECTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN EARNINGS

OR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES PRIOR TO OCCURRENCE. A

CATASTROPHE MAY ALSO RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS AND

ASSESSMENTS FROM VARIOUS POOLS.

CATASTROPHE LOSS

LOSS AND DIRECTLY

IDENTIFIED LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FROM CATASTROPHES.

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

A FORM OF EXCESS OF LOSS

REINSURANCE WHICH, SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED LIMIT, INDEMNIFIES THE CEDING

COMPANY FOR THE AMOUNT OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED RETENTION WITH

RESPECT TO AN ACCUMULATION OF LOSSES RESULTING FROM A CATASTROPHIC EVENT. THE

ACTUAL REINSURANCE DOCUMENT IS CALLED A CATASTROPHE COVER. THESE

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY DESIGNED TO COVER PROPERTY INSURANCE

LOSSES BUT CAN BE WRITTEN TO COVER CASUALTY INSURANCE LOSSES SUCH AS FROM

WORKERS COMPENSATION POLICIES.

PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

(GAAP).

DEFICIENCY

WITH REGARD TO RESERVES

FOR A GIVEN LIABILITY, A DEFICIENCY EXISTS WHEN IT IS ESTIMATED OR DETERMINED

THAT THE RESERVES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT VALUE OF

THE RELATED LIABILITIES. WHERE THE DEFICIENCY IS THE RESULT OF AN ESTIMATE,

THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF DEFICIENCY (OR EVEN THE FINDING OF WHETHER OR NOT A

DEFICIENCY EXISTS) MAY CHANGE AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUMS

39

GROUND-UP METHOD

A METHOD TO ESTIMATE

ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT

YEAR/PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT. IT INVOLVES ANALYZING THE EXPOSURE AT AN

INDIVIDUAL INSURED LEVEL AND THEN THROUGH THE USE OF DETERMINISTIC OR

STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS AND/OR SIMULATIONS, ESTIMATING THE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR

THOSE INSUREDS. THE TOTAL LOSSES FOR THE COHORT ARE THEN THE SUM OF THE

LOSSES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL INSURED.

IN PRACTICE, THE METHOD

IS SOMETIMES SIMPLIFIED BY PERFORMING THE INDIVIDUAL INSURED ANALYSIS ONLY

FOR THE LARGER INSUREDS, WITH THE COSTS FOR THE SMALLER INSUREDS ESTIMATED

VIA SAMPLING APPROACHES (EXTRAPOLATED TO THE REST OF THE SMALLER INSURED

POPULATION) OR AGGREGATE APPROACHES (USING ASSUMPTIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE

GROUND-UP LARGER INSURED ANALYSIS).

41

PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD TO

ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT

YEAR/PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED

FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID

LOSSES.

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE

METHOD IS THAT CUMULATIVE PAID LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS WILL GROW

IN A STABLE, PREDICTABLE PATTERN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR, BASED ON THE AGE OF THE

COHORT. THESE AGE-TO-AGE GROWTH FACTORS ARE SOMETIMES CALLED LINK RATIOS.

FOR EXAMPLE, IF

CUMULATIVE PAID LOSSES FOR A PRODUCT LINE XYZ FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2004 WERE

$100 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 (12 MONTHS AFTER THE START OF THAT ACCIDENT

YEAR), THEN GREW TO $120 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 (24 MONTHS AFTER THE

START), THE LINK RATIO FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR FROM 12 TO 24 MONTHS WOULD BE

1.20. IF THE LINK RATIO FOR OTHER RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS FROM 12 TO 24 MONTHS

FOR THAT PRODUCT LINE WERE ALSO AT OR AROUND 1.20, THEN THE METHOD WOULD

ASSUME A SIMILAR RESULT FOR THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR, I.E., THAT IT TOO

WOULD HAVE ITS CUMULATIVE PAID LOSSES GROW 120% FROM THE 12 MONTH TO 24 MONTH

VALUATION.

THIS IS REPEATED FOR

EACH AGE-TO-AGE PERIOD INTO THE FUTURE UNTIL THE AGE-TO-AGE LINK RATIOS FOR

FUTURE PERIODS ARE ASSUMED TO BE 1.0 (I.E., THE AGE AT WHICH CUMULATIVE

LOSSES ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE STOPPED GROWING).

A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEARS

CUMULATIVE LOSSES ARE THEN PROJECTED TO ULTIMATE BY MULTIPLYING CURRENT

CUMULATIVE LOSSES BY SUCCESSIVE AGE-TO-AGE LINK RATIOS UP TO THAT FUTURE AGE

WHERE GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO END. FOR EXAMPLE, IF GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO END AT

60 MONTHS, THEN THE ULTIMATE INDICATION FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR WITH CUMULATIVE

LOSSES AT 12 MONTHS EQUALS THOSE LOSSES TIMES A 12 TO 24 MONTH LINK RATIO,

TIMES A 24 TO 36 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A 36 TO 48 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A

48 TO 60 MONTH LINK RATIO.

ADVANCED APPLICATIONS OF

THE METHOD INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGING CONDITIONS DURING THE HISTORICAL

PERIOD AND ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE FUTURE.

THE APPROACH IS THE SAME

AS THAT DESCRIBED IN THIS GLOSSARY UNDER THE PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD,

BUT BASED ON THE GROWTH IN CUMULATIVE CLAIM COUNTS RATHER THAN PAID LOSSES. THE

BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT CUMULATIVE CLAIM COUNTS FOR A GIVEN

CREATED BY STATE LEGISLATION EITHER BECAUSE OF LACK OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE

SUCH AS: PROPERTY COVERAGE IN A WINDSTORM PRONE AREA OR PROTECTION OF THE

ACCIDENT VICTIM AS IN THE CASE OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. THE COSTS OF THE

RESIDUAL MARKET ARE USUALLY CHARGED BACK TO THE DIRECT INSURANCE CARRIERS IN

PROPORTION TO THE CARRIERS VOLUNTARY MARKET SHARES FOR THE TYPE OF COVERAGE

INVOLVED.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY

CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS

REPORT, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD

MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR

ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE.

OUR

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF

CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, INCLUDING

HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER AND FIRES.

CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO BE MAN-MADE, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE

INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS) OR A

CONSEQUENCE OF WAR OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR

BUSINESS SUBJECTS US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE FROM HURRICANES IN THE NORTHEAST,

FLORIDA, GULF COAST AND MID-ATLANTIC REGIONS, AS WELL AS CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE

FROM EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE NEW MADRID AND PACIFIC NORTHWEST

REGIONS. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY

UNPREDICTABLE. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS HAVE

ADDED TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND FREQUENCY OF NATURAL DISASTERS IN CERTAIN

PARTS OF THE WORLD AND CREATED ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO FUTURE TRENDS AND

EXPOSURES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL AND

MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS WILL INCREASE. IN PARTICULAR, WE EXPECT THAT THE

TREND OF INCREASED SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS EXPERIENCED IN 2005 AND 2004,

ALTHOUGH NOT EVIDENT IN 2006, MAY CONTINUE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM

A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE

AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. STATES HAVE FROM TIME

TO TIME PASSED LEGISLATION THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF

INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK, SUCH AS LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS

FROM WITHDRAWING FROM CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS. IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING

CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES AND COURT DECISIONS

WHICH SEEK TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE

ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE POLICIES. ALSO, OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICING TO THE

EXTENT NECESSARY TO OFFSET RISING COSTS OF CATASTROPHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE

PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, REQUIRES APPROVAL OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF

CERTAIN STATES. OUR ABILITY OR OUR WILLINGNESS TO RAISE PRICING, MODIFY

UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCE EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE

TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND/OR

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WE ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS WE MIGHT NOT

OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING OUR ACCESS TO OTHER

UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES.

THERE ARE ALSO RISKS WHICH

IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE

ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY

BY US AND OUR INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY

OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES

AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX

FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED

BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES;

ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE;

INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A

CATASTROPHES OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN

ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT

REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL

CLAIMS EMERGE.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY FISCAL

QUARTER OR YEAR AND MAY MATERIALLY HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, WHICH IN TURN

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS AND COULD

IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ALSO, RATING

AGENCIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US

TO RAISE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RATINGS. IN

ADDITION, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD CAUSE US TO EXHAUST OUR AVAILABLE

REINSURANCE LIMITS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF

REINSURANCE.

FOR OUR EXPOSURE TO

CATASTROPHE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM, WE HAVE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE

IN OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM, AND ALTHOUGH THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION

ACT OF 2005 PROVIDES

46

BENEFITS

IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM, IT MAY NOT BE EXTENDED BEYOND 2007

OR ITS BENEFITS MAY BE REDUCED. GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY

OF TERRORISM LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN OUR OWN

REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY THOSE

INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND/OR LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE PERIODS, PARTICULARLY IF THE TERRORISM ACT IS NOT

EXTENDED.

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED

OUR LOSS RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF LOSS RESERVES ARE

NECESSARY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE

UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN

REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES

DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION

TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE

EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL

COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES

OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, WE ALSO TAKE

INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.

THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING

LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF

VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL

EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION,

LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE

ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT

TO ESTIMATE. LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY

PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE

POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE

FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE

POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER).

WE CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A

REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL

CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE

PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION, ON A CONSISTENT BASIS OVER TIME, OF VARIOUS

INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND

ANALYSES.  DIFFERENT EXPERTS MAY CHOOSE

DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR

INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF FOCUS.  HENCE, SUCH EXPERTS MAY AT TIMES PRODUCE

ESTIMATES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.

EXPERTS PROVIDING INPUT TO THE VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND UNDERLYING

ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE ACTUARIES, UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS

WELL AS OTHER COMPANY MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER

VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES.

WE RIGOROUSLY ATTEMPT TO

CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME LOSS

RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING LOSS

RESERVE ESTIMATES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT

ENVIRONMENT, FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM

THAT ANTICIPATED AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE

FUTURE MAY YIELD A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN CURRENTLY RESERVEDFAVORABLE

OR UNFAVORABLE.

BECAUSE OF THE

UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN

EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES

IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND

COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES BY PRODUCT LINE, INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF

COMMON FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT REQUIRED RESERVES, SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BECAUSE OF OUR POTENTIAL

EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

WE

BELIEVE THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM

COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND INSURANCE

COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE INTENT OF INSURERS AND

POLICYHOLDERS. WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN ASBESTOS CLAIMS OVER THE

PAST TWO YEARS, WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS

FROM OUR POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY),

INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST OUR POLICYHOLDERS BY INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT APPEAR TO

BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE. FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS

INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS, THE FOCUS

BY PLAINTIFFS ON NEW AND PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS AND ENTITIES SEEKING

BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS A RESULT OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION

TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY

INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES BY INITIALLY DELAYING THE

REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS

PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING US. BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS HAVE ALSO CAUSED

INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN

BANKRUPTCY BUT THAT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. RECENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS,

THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL

EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS,

WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION HAVE THEIR

HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET. THIS TREND OF

PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE

FOCUS ON NEW AND PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOSS AND

LOSS EXPENSE PAYMENTS EXPERIENCED BY US. IN ADDITION, OUR ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSS

AND LOSS EXPENSE EXPERIENCE IS IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE

TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURANCE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG

WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS.

WE CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED

IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE

FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, ACANDS, INC., WHO IN SOME

INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS

ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. (SEE ITEM 3LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS). IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH

INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER

THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN

POLICYHOLDERS FAVOR AND OUR OTHER DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR COVERAGE

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND

BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF ASBESTOS

BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE

SEEN A MODERATION IN THE OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

MANY COVERAGE DISPUTES

WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE

MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING BANKRUPT

POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO US BUT

WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN ORIGINALLY

ANTICIPATED. THERE ALSO MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE A COURT MAY NOT APPROVE A

PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY

LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FOR US. AS IN THE PAST, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE

SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN ADDITION, PROCEEDINGS

HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, CHALLENGING

INSURERS CONDUCT IN RESPECT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS BY INDIVIDUALS

SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. OTHER

DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, COULD BE FILED IN THE FUTURE. IT

IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE

PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON

NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY.

48

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

WE

CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE

FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC

SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS

REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE

COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA),

ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL

AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND THREATENED

RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF

RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO

UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL

WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

WE HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE

TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. WE BELIEVE THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS HAVE INTERPRETED THE

INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND

POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE

ISSUED BY US PRIOR TO THE MID-1970S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE

INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT BY THE CLAIMANT

FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND WE DO NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING

SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

AS

A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND

MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE

ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT

LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX

LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS

ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR

DECREASE IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED,

THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES WE HAVE ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR

ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE

FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH OUR

PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS

AGAINST US AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER

REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, OUR

ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN

IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER

INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE

INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOTED A RECENT

DECREASE IN THE NUMBER AND VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCIES. IT IS

ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT

AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS,

AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION, INCLUDING LEGISLATION RELATED TO

ASBESTOS REFORM. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LARGE

COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS

ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY

WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES

AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS

OF ASBESTOS RESERVES, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF ASBESTOS

POLICYHOLDERS, WE CONTINUE TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER

DEVELOPMENTS. WE COMPLETED OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REVIEW DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2006. SEE THE ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION SECTIONS OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALSO SEE ITEM 3LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

A PORTION OF OUR LOSS

RESERVES ARE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION WHICH

AGGREGATED $4.47 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. WHILE THE ONGOING STUDY OF

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

49

CLAIMS

AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS

TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT

IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF OUR

MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES

REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS

FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING

RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION AND MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO, AND MAY

FACE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING, MASS TORT CLAIMS SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO

EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES.

IN

ADDITION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO OTHER

TYPES OF MASS TORT CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY

HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING LEAD PAINT, SILICA AND WELDING ROD

FUMES. ESTABLISHING CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MASS TORT

CLAIMS IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTIES BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY, DISPUTES CONCERNING MEDICAL CAUSATION WITH RESPECT TO

CERTAIN DISEASES, GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION OF THE LAWSUITS ASSERTING THE

CLAIMS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE RISE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS WITHOUT

UNDERLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN DISEASE

RATES. MOREOVER, EVOLVING JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF

VARIOUS TORT THEORIES AND DEFENSES, INCLUDING APPLICATION OF VARIOUS THEORIES

OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF INSURANCE

COVERAGE TO THESE CLAIMS, IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY

FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES

SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE

CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN

ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING

CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

AS

INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL, JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIM AND

COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY EITHER

EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OUR UNDERWRITING INTENT OR BY INCREASING THE NUMBER

OR SIZE OF CLAIMS. EXAMPLES OF EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE.

·

ADVERSE

CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS, INCLUDING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN MEDICAL COSTS

AND AUTO AND HOME REPAIR COSTS;

·

JUDICIAL

EXPANSION OF POLICY COVERAGE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY;

·

A

GROWING TREND OF PLAINTIFFS TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS, INCLUDING

US, IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATING TO CLAIM-HANDLING AND OTHER

PRACTICES;

·

INCREASES

IN THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF CLAIMS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS, WHICH OFTEN

PRESENT COMPLEX COVERAGE AND DAMAGE VALUATION QUESTIONS;

·

INCREASES

IN THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPENSES FOR TESTING AND

REMEDIATION OF MOLD CONDITIONS; AND

·

CLAIMS

FROM DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE RELATING TO POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING

IRREGULARITIES, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ISSUES AND STOCK OPTION BACKDATING,

SPRING-LOADING AND OTHER OPTION GRANT PRACTICES.

THE EFFECTS OF THESE AND

OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO

PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

50

REINSURANCE MAY NOT

PROTECT US AGAINST LOSSES.

WE

USE REINSURANCE TO HELP MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO PROPERTY AND CASUALTY RISKS. THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET

CONDITIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRICE AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY, WHICH CAN AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO US TO

THE EXTENT OF THE CEDED REINSURANCE, WE REMAIN LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON

ALL RISKS REINSURED. AS A RESULT, CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT

ELIMINATE OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT

RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS. IN

ADDITION, SOME OF OUR REINSURANCE CLAIMS MAY BE DISPUTED BY THE REINSURERS, AND

WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE PARTIAL OR NO PAYMENT. THIS IS A PARTICULAR RISK IN

THE CASE OF CLAIMS THAT RELATE TO INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO,

INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. REINSURANCE MAY

NOT PROTECT US AGAINST LOSSES AND MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS

THE SUBJECT OF A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS BY STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IN

THE UNITED STATES. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS OR THE

IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

AS PART OF ONGOING,

INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND

WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES,

INCLUDING FROM THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF NUMEROUS STATES, VARIOUS STATES

INSURANCE AND BUSINESS REGULATORS AND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

THE AREAS OF PENDING INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO US INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

BROKERS AND AGENTS AND OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH NON-TRADITIONAL INSURANCE AND

REINSURANCE PRODUCTS. WE AND OUR AFFILIATES MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SUBPOENAS

AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE OR OTHER AREAS FROM

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR AUTHORITIES. WE ARE COOPERATING WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE ITEM 3LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO

REACH ANY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS OR THE IMPACT

ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. POTENTIAL OUTCOMES COULD INCLUDE

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS OR SETTLEMENTS RESULTING IN FINES, PENALTIES AND/OR

CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THESE INVESTIGATIONS MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN LAWS AND

REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL WHICH COULD, IN TURN, ALSO

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY

REGULATED AND CHANGES IN REGULATION MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT OUR

GROWTH.

WE ARE EXTENSIVELY REGULATED AND

SUPERVISED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING

LICENSING AND SUPERVISION BY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY AGENCIES IN SUCH

JURISDICTIONS. THIS REGULATORY SYSTEM IS GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE

INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS, AND NOT NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF INSURERS,

THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INVESTORS. THIS REGULATORY SYSTEM ALSO ADDRESSES

AUTHORIZATION FOR LINES OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS,

LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, UNDERWRITING

LIMITATIONS, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS, CHANGES IN

CONTROL, PREMIUM RATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL

COMPONENTS OF AN INSURERS BUSINESS.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE STATE

INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS COME UNDER INCREASED FEDERAL SCRUTINY, AND

SOME STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR

INCREASE STATE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING

COMPANIES. FURTHER, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC)

AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY REEXAMINE EXISTING LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY

REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS

AND REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, CONGRESS AND SOME FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM TIME TO

TIME INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT CONDITION OF INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE UNITED

STATES TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO IMPOSE FEDERAL OR NATIONAL REGULATION OR TO

ALLOW AN OPTIONAL FEDERAL CHARTER, SIMILAR TO THE OPTION AVAILABLE TO MOST

BANKS. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE EFFECT ANY PROPOSED OR FUTURE

LEGISLATION OR NAIC INITIATIVES MAY HAVE ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS.

INSURANCE LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE

RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT REQUIREMENTS OR MAY RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS.

ALTHOUGH THE UNITED STATES

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DIRECTLY REGULATE THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, CHANGES

IN FEDERAL LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES IN SEVERAL

AREAS, INCLUDING CHANGES

51

IN

FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION (E.G. THE REPEAL OF THE MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT)

AND FEDERAL TAXATION, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING

US.

A DOWNGRADE IN OUR

CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR

BUSINESS VOLUMES, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS

AND INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS.

CLAIMS-PAYING

AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO AN

INSURERS COMPETITIVE POSITION. RATING AGENCIES REVIEW THEIR RATINGS

PERIODICALLY, AND OUR CURRENT RATINGS MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. A

DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS

VOLUMES, BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS MAY BE

REDUCED OR OUR RATINGS COULD FALL BELOW MINIMUM LEVELS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN

EXISTING BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE

CAPITAL MARKETS AND HIGHER BORROWING COSTS MAY BE INCURRED. IF OUR CAPITAL

POSITION WERE TO DETERIORATE OR ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES WERE TO

SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY

CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR LIMIT THE EXTENT OF A

DOWNGRADE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY OF WEATHER-RELATED

CATASTROPHES IN THE LAST TWO YEARS MAY LEAD RATING AGENCIES TO SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE RATINGS ARE NOT IN ANY WAY A MEASURE

OF PROTECTION OFFERED TO INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED

UPON WITH RESPECT TO MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR RATINGS, SEE, ITEM 1BUSINESSRATINGS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR LOSSES WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

INVESTMENT

RETURNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY. ACCORDINGLY,

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME OR EQUITY MARKETS COULD IMPAIR OUR

PROFITABILITY.

FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST

RATES AFFECT OUR RETURNS ON, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF, FIXED INCOME AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WHICH COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 94% OF THE MARKET VALUE

OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN ADDITION, DEFAULTS

BY THIRD PARTIES, PRIMARILY FROM INVESTMENTS IN LIQUID CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL

BONDS, WHO FAIL TO PAY OR PERFORM ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS COULD REDUCE OUR NET

INVESTMENT INCOME AND NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OR RESULT IN INVESTMENT

LOSSES.

WE INVEST A PORTION OF OUR

ASSETS IN EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE RELATED INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

GREATER VOLATILITY THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE RELATED INVESTMENTS AND THE

REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY NOT

REALIZE AN ADEQUATE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS, MAY INCUR LOSSES ON SALES OF OUR

INVESTMENTS AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS,

WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.

THE INTENSE COMPETITION

THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR PROFITABILITY

AND PREMIUM VOLUME.

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL REMAIN

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND

FOREIGN INSURERS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN WE DO. IN

ADDITION, SEVERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL LINES OF

BUSINESS NOW OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION, INCLUDING

LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE THAT UTILIZE

CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS. CONTINUED GROWTH IN

ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION COULD REDUCE OUR PREMIUM VOLUME. FOLLOWING

THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 AND AGAIN FOLLOWING THE

HURRICANE ACTIVITY IN 2004 AND 2005, A NUMBER OF NEW INSURERS AND REINSURERS

WERE FORMED TO COMPETE IN THE INDUSTRY, AND A NUMBER OF EXISTING MARKET

PARTICIPANTS HAVE RAISED NEW CAPITAL WHICH MAY ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO

COMPETE.

OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING.

·

OUR

PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH,

·

RATINGS

ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES,

·

GEOGRAPHIC

SCOPE OF BUSINESS,

52

·

AGENT,

BROKER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS,

·

PREMIUMS

CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED

(INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED PROGRAMS),

·

SPEED

OF CLAIMS PAYMENT,

·

REPUTATION,

EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES,

·

LOCAL

PRESENCE AND

·

OUR

ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND

INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN

CONTINUING TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON ANY OF THESE BASES IN THE FUTURE. IF

COMPETITION LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS AT ADEQUATE RATES, OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE ITEM 1BUSINESSCOMPETITION.

THE INABILITY OF OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS WOULD HARM

OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY FUTURE DIVIDENDS.

WE

ARE A HOLDING COMPANY AND RELY IN PART ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON

OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND CORPORATE

EXPENSES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN

THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THEIR STATUTORY SURPLUS, EARNINGS AND REGULATORY

RESTRICTIONS.

WE AND OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY SOME STATES AS AN INSURANCE HOLDING

COMPANY SYSTEM. THIS REGULATION GENERALLY PROVIDES THAT TRANSACTIONS AMONG

COMPANIES WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM MUST BE FAIR AND REASONABLE.

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS AMONG AFFILIATED COMPANIES, CERTAIN DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FROM

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN COMPANIES

WITHIN THE SYSTEM MAY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE TO, OR PRIOR APPROVAL BY, STATE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO

BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US

ALSO IS RESTRICTED BY REGULATIONS THAT SET STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE

MET AND MAINTAINED, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATION ON INVESTMENTS, THE NATURE OF

AND LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND SHAREHOLDERS, THE NATURE AND

EXTENT OF REQUIRED PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE GUARANTY FUNDS AND THE

INVOLUNTARY ASSUMPTION OF HARD-TO-PLACE OR HIGH-RISK INSURANCE BUSINESS,

PRIMARILY IN WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE LINES. THE INABILITY OF OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO MEET

OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY

TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY FUTURE DIVIDENDS.

ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER

SURCHARGES FOR GUARANTY FUNDS, SECOND-INJURY FUNDS, CATASTROPHE FUNDS AND OTHER

MANDATORY POOLING ARRANGEMENTS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

VIRTUALLY

ALL STATES REQUIRE INSURERS LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS IN THEIR STATE TO BEAR A

PORTION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED BY SOME INSUREDS AS THE RESULT OF IMPAIRED OR

INSOLVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES. GUARANTY FUND ASSESSMENTS HAVE LEVELED OFF IN

THE RECENT YEAR AND, IN CERTAIN STATES, HAVE BEGUN TO DECREASE. THESE

ASSESSMENTS MAY, HOWEVER, INCREASE IN THE FUTURE IF ADDITIONAL INSOLVENCIES

OCCUR. MANY STATES ALSO HAVE LAWS THAT ESTABLISHED SECOND-INJURY FUNDS TO

PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO INJURED EMPLOYEES FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRIOR CONDITION

OR INJURY WHICH ARE FUNDED BY EITHER ASSESSMENTS BASED ON PAID LOSSES OR

PREMIUM SURCHARGE MECHANISMS. IN ADDITION, AS A CONDITION TO THE ABILITY TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS STATES, OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES MUST PARTICIPATE

IN MANDATORY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY SHARED-MARKET MECHANISMS OR POOLING

ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH PROVIDE VARIOUS TYPES OF INSURANCE COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUALS

OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE THAT COVERAGE FROM

PRIVATE INSURERS. THE EFFECT OF THESE ASSESSMENTS AND MANDATORY SHARED-MARKET

MECHANISMS OR CHANGES IN THEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PROFITABILITY OR LIMIT OUR

ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.

LOSS OR SIGNIFICANT

RESTRICTION OF THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN THE PRICING AND UNDERWRITING OF PERSONAL

INSURANCE PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

IN

PERSONAL INSURANCE, WE USE CREDIT SCORING AS A FACTOR IN PRICING DECISIONS

WHERE ALLOWED BY STATE LAW. SOME CONSUMER GROUPS AND REGULATORS HAVE

53

QUESTIONED WHETHER

THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH LOW

INCOMES, MINORITY GROUPS AND THE ELDERLY AND ARE CALLING FOR THE PROHIBITION OR

RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING. LAWS OR

REGULATIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING, IF ENACTED IN

A LARGE NUMBER OF STATES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

DISRUPTIONS TO OUR

RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR DISTRIBUTORS, INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE

PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. AN IMPORTANT PART OF

OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN THROUGH FEWER THAN A DOZEN SUCH INTERMEDIARIES. LOSS OF

ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDED THROUGH SUCH AGENTS AND

BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY.

WE DISCONTINUED PAYING

CONTINGENT COMMISSIONS ON EXCESS CASUALTY AND UMBRELLA BUSINESS EFFECTIVE

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. IN ADDITION, WE DISCONTINUED PAYING CONTINGENT

COMMISSIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS MULTI-PERIL, PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE PHYSICAL

DAMAGE, PRIVATE PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE NO-FAULT, OTHER PRIVATE PASSENGER

AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY, BOILER AND MACHINERY AND FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE

LINES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. WE HAVE DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR THESE LINES OF BUSINESS THAT COMPENSATE OUR

BROKERS AND AGENTS IN A MANNER THAT DIFFERENTIATES FOR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND

IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS. SHOULD THESE ALTERNATIVE COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS NOT BE ACCEPTED IN THE MARKETPLACE, THE RESULTING LOSS OF BUSINESS

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY.

WE INCREASINGLY RELY ON

INTERNET APPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKETING AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS

THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. IN ADDITION, IN SOME INSTANCES, THOSE

AGENTS AND BROKERS ARE REQUIRED TO ACCESS SEPARATE BUSINESS PLATFORMS TO

EXECUTE THE SALE OF OUR RESPECTIVE PERSONAL INSURANCE OR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE

PRODUCTS. SHOULD INTERNET DISRUPTIONS OCCUR, OR FRUSTRATION WITH OUR BUSINESS

PLATFORMS DEVELOP AMONG OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE LOSS OF

BUSINESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY.

IF WE EXPERIENCE

DIFFICULTIES WITH OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, TECHNOLOGY AND/OR DATA SECURITY

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MIGHT BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

WE OUTSOURCE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY

FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES AND MAY DO SO INCREASINGLY IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DO

NOT EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT OUR OUTSOURCING STRATEGY, THIRD PARTY

PROVIDERS DO NOT PERFORM AS ANTICIPATED OR WE EXPERIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER

PROBLEMS WITH A TRANSITION, WE MAY NOT REALIZE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS OR

COST EFFICIENCIES AND MAY EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, INCREASED COSTS

AND A LOSS OF BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE

SERVICES FROM THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE

IMPACTED BY CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, UNANTICIPATED

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR POLICIES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AS

A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WHILE TECHNOLOGY CAN

STREAMLINE MANY BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE COST OF

OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES PRESENT CERTAIN RISKS. OUR BUSINESS IS

HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR EMPLOYEES ABILITY TO PERFORM, IN AN EFFICIENT AND

UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS INTERNET SUPPORT

AND 24-HOUR CALL CENTERS, PROCESSING NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS, AND

PROCESSING AND PAYING CLAIMS. A SHUT-DOWN OF, OR INABILITY TO, ACCESS ONE OR

MORE OF OUR FACILITIES, A POWER OUTAGE, OR A FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SUCH FUNCTIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS. IN ADDITION,

BECAUSE OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS INTERFACE

WITH AND DEPEND ON THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE SERVICE DENIALS IF

DEMAND FOR SUCH SERVICE EXCEEDS CAPACITY OR A THIRD-PARTY SYSTEM FAILS OR

EXPERIENCES AN INTERRUPTION. IF SUSTAINED OR REPEATED, SUCH A BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION, SYSTEM FAILURE OR SERVICE DENIAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERIORATION

OF OUR ABILITY TO WRITE AND PROCESS NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS, PROVIDE CUSTOMER

SERVICE, PAY CLAIMS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR PERFORM OTHER NECESSARY BUSINESS

FUNCTIONS. COMPUTER VIRUSES, HACKERS AND OTHER EXTERNAL HAZARDS COULD EXPOSE

OUR DATA SYSTEMS TO SECURITY BREACHES. THESE INCREASED RISKS AND EXPANDING

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS COULD EXPOSE US TO DATA LOSS, DAMAGES AND

54

SIGNIFICANT

INCREASES IN COMPLIANCE COSTS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS

MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED STAFF

COMMENTS

ON JULY 23, 2004, THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION

OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATE PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $1.63

BILLION ($1.07 BILLION AFTER-TAX). THE COMPANY RECORDED THESE ADJUSTMENTS AS CHARGES

IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. THROUGH

AN INFORMAL COMMENT PROCESS, THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE

HAS SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, WHICH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED.

SPECIFICALLY, THE STAFF HAS ASKED FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANYS

ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN OF SPCS INSURANCE RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES AND PREMIUMS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AND HOW THOSE ADJUSTMENTS MAY

RELATE TO SPCS RESERVES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER OF SPC AND TPC. AFTER

REVIEWING THE STAFFS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMPANYS

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT FOR THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE. IF, HOWEVER, THE STAFF

DISAGREES, SOME OR ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS BEING DISCUSSED MAY NOT BE RECORDED

AS CHARGES IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, THEREBY

INCREASING NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2004 AND INCREASING

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, IN EACH CASE BY

THE APPROXIMATE AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF THE CHANGE. THE EFFECT ON TANGIBLE

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTS OF DEFERRED TAXES ASSOCIATED

WITH GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL.

INCREASES TO GOODWILL AND

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WOULD BE REFLECTED ON THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET AS

OF APRIL 1, 2004, EITHER DUE TO PURCHASE ACCOUNTING OR ADJUSTMENT OF SPCS

RESERVES PRIOR TO THE MERGER OF SPC AND TPC. ON MAY 3, 2006, THE COMPANY

RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE SEC (THE DIVISION)

ADVISING THE COMPANY THAT IT IS CONDUCTING AN INQUIRY RELATING TO THE SECOND

QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS AND THE APRIL 1, 2004 MERGER BETWEEN SPC AND TPC.

THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THE DIVISIONS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.

IN THE OPINION OF THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANYS PROPERTIES ARE ADEQUATE AND SUITABLE FOR

ITS BUSINESS AS PRESENTLY CONDUCTED AND ARE ADEQUATELY MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

THIS SECTION DESCRIBES THE

MAJOR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE LITIGATION

INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS, TO WHICH THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS

A PARTY OR TO WHICH ANY OF THE COMPANYS PROPERTY IS SUBJECT.

ASBESTOS- AND

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED PROCEEDINGS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE

COMPANY RECEIVES CLAIMS FOR INSURANCE ARISING UNDER POLICIES ISSUED BY THE

COMPANY ASSERTING ALLEGED INJURIES AND DAMAGES FROM ASBESTOS, HAZARDOUS WASTE

AND OTHER TOXIC SUBSTANCES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION,

INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LITIGATION DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY CONTINUES

TO BE SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED LITIGATION. THE CONDITIONS

SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE RELATED LITIGATION

CONTINUE TO CHANGE.

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) IS INVOLVED IN

THREE SIGNIFICANT PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING) RELATING TO

ACANDS, INC. (ACANDS), FORMERLY A NATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR AND INSTALLER OF

PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS. THE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE DISPUTES AS TO WHETHER

AND TO WHAT EXTENT ANY OF ACANDS POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR CURRENT OR FUTURE

BODILY INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. THE

STATUS OF THE VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS IS DESCRIBED BELOW.

ACANDS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN SEPTEMBER 2002 (

IN RE: ACANDS, INC.,

PENDING IN THE

U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE). IN ITS PROPOSED PLAN OF

REORGANIZATION, ACANDS SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A TRUST TO PAY ASBESTOS BODILY

INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST IT AND SOUGHT TO ASSIGN TO THE TRUST ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE

INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. THE PROPOSED PLAN AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

FILED BY ACANDS CLAIMED THAT ACANDS HAD SETTLED THE VAST MAJORITY OF

ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT FOR

APPROXIMATELY $2.80 BILLION. ACANDS ASSERTS THAT, BASED ON A PRIOR AGREEMENT

BETWEEN TPC AND ACANDS AND ACANDS INTERPRETATION OF THE JULY 31,

2003 ARBITRATION PANEL RULING DESCRIBED BELOW, TPC IS LIABLE FOR 45% OF THE

$2.80 BILLION. ON JANUARY 26, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ISSUED A DECISION

REJECTING CONFIRMATION OF ACANDS PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT FOUND, CONSISTENT WITH TPCS OBJECTIONS TO ACANDS PROPOSED

PLAN, THAT THE PROPOSED PLAN WAS NOT FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR, WAS NOT PROPOSED IN

GOOD FAITH AND DID NOT COMPLY WITH SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY

CODE. ACANDS HAS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS DECISION

AND HAS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS FINDINGS OF FACT AND

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT. TPC HAS MOVED TO

DISMISS THE APPEAL AND OBJECTIONS AND HAS ALSO FILED AN OPPOSITION TO ACANDS

OBJECTIONS.

AN ARBITRATION WAS COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2001 TO

DETERMINE WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT ACANDS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR BODILY

INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INSURANCE POLICY AGGREGATE LIMITS. ON JULY 31,

2003, THE ARBITRATION PANEL RULED IN FAVOR OF TPC THAT ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY

CLAIMS AGAINST ACANDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE AGGREGATE LIMITS OF THE POLICIES

ISSUED TO ACANDS, WHICH HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED. IN OCTOBER 2003, ACANDS

COMMENCED A LAWSUIT SEEKING TO VACATE THE ARBITRATION AWARD AS BEYOND THE PANELS

SCOPE OF AUTHORITY (

ACANDS, INC. V.

TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.,

U.S.D.CT. E.D. PA.). ON SEPTEMBER 16,

2004, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED AN ORDER DENYING ACANDS MOTION TO VACATE THE

ARBITRATION AWARD. ON JANUARY 19, 2006, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT REVERSED THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION AND DECLARED THE

ARBITRATION AWARD VOID ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS. ON MAY 22, 2006, THE

56

UNITED STATES SUPREME

COURT DENIED TPCS PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI SEEKING REVIEW OF THE

THIRD CIRCUITS DECISION. AS A RESULT, THE MATTER HAS BEEN REMANDED TO DISTRICT

COURT AND TPC HAS ASKED THE DISTRICT COURT TO REMAND THE ARBITRATION TO THE

PANEL THAT INITIALLY RULED IN FAVOR OF TPC FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT

WITH THE THIRD CIRCUITS DECISION. ACANDS HAS OPPOSED THAT REQUEST.

IN THE OTHER PROCEEDING, A RELATED CASE PENDING BEFORE

THE SAME COURT AND COMMENCED IN SEPTEMBER 2000 (

ACANDS V. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.

, U.S.D.CT., E.D.

PA.), ACANDS SOUGHT A DECLARATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ASBESTOS BODILY

INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST ACANDS ARE SUBJECT TO OCCURRENCE LIMITS UNDER INSURANCE

POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. TPC FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION BASED UPON

THE JULY 31, 2003 ARBITRATION DECISION DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DISTRICT COURT

FOUND THE DISPUTE WAS MOOT AS A RESULT OF THE ARBITRATION PANELS DECISION AND

DISMISSED THE CASE. AS A RESULT OF THE JANUARY 19, 2006 RULING BY THE

THIRD CIRCUIT AND THE SUPREME COURTS DENIAL OF CERTIORARI, DESCRIBED IN THE

PARAGRAPH ABOVE, THIS CASE HAS BEEN REINSTATED.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IT HAS MERITORIOUS

POSITIONS IN THESE ACANDS-RELATED PROCEEDINGS AND INTENDS TO LITIGATE

VIGOROUSLY.

IN OCTOBER 2001 AND APRIL 2002, TWO

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS (

WISE V.

TRAVELERS

AND

MENINGER V. TRAVELERS

)

WERE FILED AGAINST TPC AND OTHER INSURERS (NOT INCLUDING SPC) IN STATE COURT IN

WEST VIRGINIA. THESE CASES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE

PROCEEDING IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE THAT THE INSURER DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BY

INAPPROPRIATELY HANDLING AND SETTLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO

REOPEN LARGE NUMBERS OF SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR

DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, DIRECTLY ON INSURERS. LAWSUITS SIMILAR TO

WISE

WERE FILED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND

HAWAII (THESE SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII

ACTIONS). ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2001, PLAINTIFFS IN CONSOLIDATED ASBESTOS

ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE A MASS TORT PANEL OF JUDGES IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT

MOVED TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT TO NAME TPC AS A DEFENDANT, ALLEGING THAT TPC

AND OTHER INSURERS BREACHED ALLEGED DUTIES TO CERTAIN USERS OF ASBESTOS

PRODUCTS. IN MARCH 2002, THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION TO AMEND. PLAINTIFFS

SEEK DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF AND

RAISING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE PRESENTED IN THE WEST VIRGINIA AMENDED

COMPLAINT ARE ALSO PENDING IN TEXAS STATE COURT AGAINST TPC AND SPC, AND IN

LOUISIANA STATE COURT AGAINST TPC (THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THESE SUITS, TOGETHER

WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA SUIT, ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE COMMON LAW

CLAIMS). LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF IN OHIO HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.

ALL OF THE ACTIONS AGAINST TPC DESCRIBED IN THE

PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, OTHER THAN THE HAWAII ACTIONS, HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO A

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER ENTERED BY THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT IN NEW YORK

THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY PRESIDED OVER AND APPROVED THE REORGANIZATION IN BANKRUPTCY

OF TPCS FORMER POLICYHOLDER JOHNS-MANVILLE CORPORATION AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES.

IN AUGUST 2002, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT HELD A HEARING ON TPCS MOTION FOR A

PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION PROHIBITING FURTHER PROSECUTION OF THE LAWSUITS PURSUANT

TO THE REORGANIZATION PLAN AND RELATED ORDERS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS

HEARING, THE COURT ORDERED THE PARTIES TO MEDIATION, APPOINTED A MEDIATOR AND

CONTINUED THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. DURING 2003, THE SAME BANKRUPTCY

COURT EXTENDED THE EXISTING INJUNCTION TO APPLY TO AN ADDITIONAL SET OF CASES FILED

IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS IN TEXAS AND OHIO AS WELL AS TO THE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE

PROSECUTING THESE CASES. THE ORDER ALSO ENJOINED THESE ATTORNEYS AND THEIR

RESPECTIVE LAW FIRMS FROM COMMENCING ANY FURTHER LAWSUITS AGAINST TPC BASED

UPON THESE ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE COURT. NOTWITHSTANDING

THE INJUNCTION, ADDITIONAL COMMON LAW CLAIMS WERE FILED AND SERVED ON TPC.

ON NOVEMBER 19, 2003, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT A SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS HAD BEEN

REACHED. THIS SETTLEMENT INCLUDES A LUMP-SUM PAYMENT OF UP TO $412 MILLION BY

TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. AFTER CONTINUED MEETINGS

WITH THE MEDIATOR, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON MAY 25,

2004 THAT A SETTLEMENT RESOLVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PENDING AND SIMILAR FUTURE

COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC HAD ALSO BEEN REACHED. THIS SETTLEMENT REQUIRES A

57

PAYMENT OF UP TO $90

MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. EACH OF THESE

SETTLEMENTS IS CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ORDER OF THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT CLARIFYING THAT ALL OF THESE CLAIMS, AND SIMILAR FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED

CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, ARE BARRED BY PRIOR ORDERS ENTERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORIGINAL JOHNS-MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.

ON AUGUST 17, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED

AN ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS AND CLARIFYING ITS PRIOR ORDERS THAT ALL OF

THE PENDING STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON LAW

CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST TPC ARE BARRED. THE ORDER ALSO APPLIES TO SIMILAR DIRECT

ACTION CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

FOUR APPEALS WERE TAKEN FROM THE AUGUST 17, 2004

RULING. ON MARCH 29, 2006, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SUBSTANTIALLY AFFIRMED THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS ORDERS WHILE

VACATING THAT PORTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS ORDERS THAT REQUIRED ALL FUTURE

DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST TPC TO FIRST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT BEFORE

PROCEEDING IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. JUDGMENT WAS ENTERED ON MARCH 31,

2006.

FIVE APPEALS FROM THE MARCH 29, 2006 RULING WERE

FILED IN THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT AND TPC FILED A

CROSS-APPEAL. TWO APPELLANTS VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THEIR APPEALS AND A MOTION

TO DISMISS THE CROSS-APPEAL WAS FILED. ADDITIONALLY, TPC APPEALED FROM A

PROCEDURAL ORDER OF THE DISTRICT COURT RELATING TO THE TIMELINESS OF THE

CROSS-APPEAL. ON JANUARY 17, 2007, THE SECOND CIRCUIT DISMISSED TPCS

CROSS-APPEAL AND DENIED TPCS APPEAL FROM THE PROCEDURAL ORDER. THE THREE

REMAINING PRINCIPAL APPEALS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR DISPOSITION AND REMAIN

PENDING. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW THE APPELLATE COURT WILL RULE ON

THE PENDING APPEALS. THE COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY OF THE SETTLEMENT

AMOUNTS UNLESS AND UNTIL THE ORDERS AND RELIEF BECOME FINAL AND ARE NOT SUBJECT

TO ANY FURTHER APPELLATE REVIEW.

SPC, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

RULINGS OR THE SETTLEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, HAS NUMEROUS DEFENSES IN ALL OF THE

DIRECT ACTION CASES ASSERTING COMMON LAW CLAIMS THAT ARE PENDING AGAINST IT. SPCS

DEFENSES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THESE NOVEL THEORIES HAVE NO BASIS IN LAW; THAT

THEY ARE DIRECTLY AT ODDS WITH THE WELL-ESTABLISHED LAW PERTAINING TO THE

INSURED/INSURER RELATIONSHIP; THAT THERE IS NO GENERALIZED DUTY TO WARN AS

ALLEGED BY THE PLAINTIFFS; AND THAT THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AS TO

MANY OF THESE CLAIMS HAS LONG SINCE EXPIRED. MANY OF THESE DEFENSES HAVE BEEN

RAISED IN INITIAL MOTIONS TO DISMISS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS. THERE

HAVE BEEN FAVORABLE RULINGS DURING 2003 AND 2004 IN TEXAS AND DURING 2004 AND

2005 IN OHIO ON SOME OF THESE MOTIONS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS THAT

DEALT WITH STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND THE VALIDITY OF THE ALLEGED CAUSES OF

ACTIONS. ON MAY 26, 2005, THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO, EIGHTH DISTRICT,

AFFIRMED THE EARLIEST OF THESE FAVORABLE RULINGS. IN TEXAS, ONLY ONE COURT, IN JUNE OF

2005, HAS DENIED THE INSURERS INITIAL CHALLENGES TO THE PLEADINGS. THAT RULING

WAS CONTRARY TO THE RULINGS BY OTHER COURTS IN SIMILAR CASES, AND SPC AND THE

OTHER INSURER DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MANDAMUS PETITION WITH THE TEXAS COURT OF

APPEALS.

THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING ITS ASBESTOS- AND

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF THESE DISPUTES IS UNCERTAIN. IN

THIS REGARD, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE

RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE,

INCLUDING SETTLING LITIGATION UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR A DISCUSSION

OF OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPOSURE, SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT LEGAL OUTCOMES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. ANY

SUCH DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND

INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THESE

UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE

CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN

58

ADDITION,

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY

CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF

EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT

CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION AND RELATED PROCEEDINGS

THREE ACTIONS AGAINST THE

COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE

PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA. TWO

OF THESE ACTIONS, WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY CAPTIONED

KAHN V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(NOV. 2, 2004) AND

MICHAEL A. BERNSTEIN

PROFIT SHARING PLAN V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(NOV. 10, 2004), ARE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT BY CERTAIN

SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND

FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED AS

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION II

,

AND A LEAD PLAINTIFF AND LEAD COUNSEL HAVE BEEN APPOINTED. ON JULY 11,

2005, THE LEAD PLAINTIFF FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT. THE AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS IN CONNECTION

WITH THE COMPANYS ALLEGED FAILURE TO MAKE DISCLOSURE RELATING TO THE PRACTICE

OF PAYING BROKERS COMMISSIONS ON A CONTINGENT BASIS, THE COMPANYS ALLEGED

INVOLVEMENT IN A CONSPIRACY TO RIG BIDS AND THE COMPANYS ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER

USE OF FINITE REINSURANCE PRODUCTS. ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2005, THE COMPANY AND

THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

IN

RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION

II

MOVED TO DISMISS THE AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT FOR FAILURE

TO STATE A CLAIM. ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS WAS

PRESENTED ON JUNE 15, 2006. BY ORDER DATED SEPTEMBER 25, 2006, THE

COURT DENIED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS. DISCOVERY HAS COMMENCED. ON NOVEMBER 3,

2006, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

IN RE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION II

MOVED FOR PARTIAL JUDGMENT

ON THE PLEADINGS SEEKING DISMISSAL OF THE ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO THE ALLEGEDLY

IMPROPER USE OF FINITE REINSURANCE PRODUCTS. THAT MOTION REMAINS PENDING. IN THE

THIRD ACTION, AN ALLEGED BENEFICIARY OF THE COMPANYS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN

COMMENCED A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CAPTIONED

SPIZIRI V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(DEC. 28, 2004). THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT BASED ON THE THEORY THAT DEFENDANTS WERE

ALLEGEDLY AWARE OF ISSUES CONCERNING THE VALUE OF SPCS LOSS RESERVES YET

FAILED TO PROTECT PLAN PARTICIPANTS FROM CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN COMPANY STOCK.

ON JUNE 1, 2005, THE COMPANY AND

THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

SPIZIRI

MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT. ON JANUARY 4, 2006, THE PARTIES IN

SPIZIRI

ENTERED INTO A STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT. THE

SETTLEMENT REMAINS SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL.

IN ADDITION, TWO

DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA AGAINST ALL OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT DIRECTORS AND

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS FORMER DIRECTORS, NAMING THE COMPANY AS A NOMINAL

DEFENDANT.

ROWE V. FISHMAN, ET AL.

(OCT. 22, 2004) AND

CLARK V. FISHMAN,

ET AL.

(NOV. 18, 2004). THE DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATED FOR PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS AS

ROWE, ET AL. V. FISHMAN, ET AL

. AND A CONSOLIDATED DERIVATIVE

COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED. THE CONSOLIDATED DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT ASSERTS STATE

LAW CLAIMS, INCLUDING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, BASED ON ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO

THOSE ALLEGED IN

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS

SECURITIES LITIGATION II

AND

SPIZIRI

DESCRIBED ABOVE. ON MARCH 23,

2006, THE COURT DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND, ON MARCH 30,

2006, ENTERED JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS. ON JUNE 5,

2006, PLAINTIFFS IN

ROWE

MOVED TO

ALTER OR AMEND THE JUDGMENT FOR LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT. THE COMPANY

AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS OPPOSED THAT MOTION. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2006, THE

PARTIES IN

ROWE

ENTERED INTO A STIPULATION OF

SETTLEMENT WHEREBY PLAINTIFFS RELEASED THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FROM

LIABILITY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AGREEMENT BY DEFENDANTS TO ADOPT CERTAIN CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE MEASURES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY. THE SETTLEMENT REMAINS

SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

THE PENDING LAWSUITS HAVE NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY; HOWEVER,

THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF

ONE OR MORE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD. THE

59

COMPANY

IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED

UNDER MINNESOTA LAW. AS PART OF THAT OBLIGATION, THE COMPANY WILL ADVANCE

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES THEY INCUR IN

DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE

COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN PROCEEDINGS ADDRESSING DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS

REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY BE INITIATED BY THE COMPANY OR THE REINSURERS

AND MAY INVOLVE THE TERMS OF THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THE COVERAGE OF

PARTICULAR CLAIMS, EXCLUSIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS COUNTERCLAIMS

FOR RESCISSION OF THE AGREEMENTS. ONE OF THESE DISPUTES IS THE ACTION DESCRIBED

IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

THE COMPANYS GULF

OPERATION BROUGHT AN ACTION ON MAY 22, 2003, AS AMENDED ON MAY 12,

2004, IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK (

GULF INSURANCE COMPANY V. TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE

COMPANY, ET AL.

), AGAINST TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY

(TRANSATLANTIC), XL REINSURANCE AMERICA, INC. (XL), ODYSSEY AMERICA

REINSURANCE CORPORATION (ODYSSEY), EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE COMPANY (EMPLOYERS)

AND GERLING GLOBAL REINSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA (GERLING), TO RECOVER

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND RELATED TO GULFS FEBRUARY 2003

SETTLEMENT OF A COVERAGE DISPUTE UNDER A VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE PROTECTION

INSURANCE POLICY. THE REINSURERS HAVE ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING RESCISSION

OF THE VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT. SEPARATE ACTIONS FILED BY

TRANSATLANTIC AND GERLING HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE ORIGINAL GULF ACTION

FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2003,

GULF ENTERED INTO A FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH EMPLOYERS, AND ALL CLAIMS

AND COUNTERCLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED. ON MAY 26,

2004, THE COURT DENIED GULFS MOTION TO DISMISS CERTAIN CLAIMS ASSERTED BY

TRANSATLANTIC AND DENIED A JOINT MOTION BY TRANSATLANTIC, XL AND ODYSSEY FOR

SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST GULF. ON DECEMBER 22, 2006, GULF AND XL ENTERED

INTO A FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WHICH RESOLVES ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN GULF AND XL

UNDER THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS AT ISSUE IN THE LITIGATION. FACT AND EXPERT

DISCOVERY ARE COMPLETE WITH RESPECT TO THE REMAINING PARTIES: TRANSATLANTIC,

ODYSSEY AND GERLING. GULF, TRANSATLANTIC AND GERLING HAVE FILED MOTIONS FOR

PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT. THE COURT HAS NOT YET SET A TRIAL DATE. GULF DENIES

THE REINSURERS ALLEGATIONS, BELIEVES THAT IT HAS A STRONG LEGAL BASIS TO

COLLECT THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INTENDS TO

VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THE ACTIONS.

BASED ON THE COMPANYS

BELIEFS ABOUT ITS LEGAL POSITIONS IN ITS VARIOUS REINSURANCE RECOVERY

PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ANY OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT

IN THREE CONSOLIDATED LAWSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA ARISING OUT OF DISPUTES WITH CERTAIN

POLICYHOLDERS OVER WHETHER INSURANCE COVERAGE IS AVAILABLE FOR FLOOD LOSSES

ARISING FROM HURRICANE KATRINA.

CHEHARDY, ET AL. V. STATE

FARM, ET AL.

, C.A. NO. 06-1672, 06-1673 AND 06-1674,

VANDERBROOK, ET AL. V. STATE FARM FIRE &

CAS. CO.

, ET AL. C.A. NO. 05-6323; AND

XAVIER UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA V. TRAVELERS PROPERTY CA. CO. OF AMERICA

,

C.A. NO. 06-516.

CHEHARDY

AND

VANDERBROOK

ARE PROPOSED CLASS ACTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY

IS ONE OF SEVERAL INSURER DEFENDANTS.

XAVIER

IS AN

INDIVIDUAL SUIT INVOLVING A PROPERTY INSURANCE POLICY BROUGHT BY ONE OF THE

COMPANYS INSUREDS. THE LOSSES INVOLVED IN ALL OF THESE SUITS ALLEGEDLY WERE

CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE NEW ORLEANS LEVEES. ON NOVEMBER 27, 2006, THE

COURT ISSUED A RULING IN THE THREE CONSOLIDATED CASES DENYING THE MOTIONS OF

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OTHER INSURERS FOR A SUMMARY DISPOSITION OF THE CASES. THE

COURTS RULING DOES NOT DETERMINE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS ARE OWED UNDER

ANY OF THE COMPANYS POLICIES OR OTHERWISE REACH THE MERITS OF THE

POLICYHOLDERS CLAIMS. THE COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE RULING AND, ALONG WITH

CERTAIN OTHER INSURERS NAMED IN THE CONSOLIDATED LAWSUITS, FILED A MOTION WITH

THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, SEEKING TO HAVE THE

COURT OF APPEALS ACCEPT AN IMMEDIATE APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURTS RULING.

ON FEBRUARY 1, 2007, THE FIFTH CIRCUIT ACCEPTED THE APPEAL.

60

AS PART OF ONGOING,

INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS, THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED

SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

AUTHORITIES. THE AREAS OF PENDING INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE ITS

RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS, AND THE COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT WITH NON-TRADITIONAL

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE

RECEIVED SUBPOENAS OR REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION, IN EACH CASE WITH RESPECT TO

ONE OR BOTH OF THE AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE, FROM: (I) STATE OF CALIFORNIA

OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (II) STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

INSURANCE; (III) LICENSING AND MARKET CONDUCT COMPLIANCE DIVISION,

FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMISSION OF ONTARIO, CANADA; (IV) STATE OF

CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT; (V) STATE OF CONNECTICUT OFFICE OF THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL; (VI) STATE OF DELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE; (VII) STATE

GENERAL; (XX) STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT; (XXI) STATE OF NEW

YORK OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XXII) STATE OF NEW YORK INSURANCE

DEPARTMENT; (XXIII) STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE; (XXIV)

STATE OF OHIO OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XXV) STATE OF OHIO DEPARTMENT OF

INSURANCE; (XXVI) STATE OF OREGON DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE; (XXVII) COMMONWEALTH

OF PENNSYLVANIA OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XXVIII) STATE OF TEXAS OFFICE

OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XXVIX) STATE OF TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE; (XXX)

COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XXXI) STATE OF

WASHINGTON OFFICE OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; (XXXII) STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA

OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL; (XXXIII) THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK; (XXXIV) THE UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE

SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY; AND (XXXV) THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL

SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE AREAS DESCRIBED

ABOVE FROM OTHER AGENCIES OR AUTHORITIES.

THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING

WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, OUTSIDE

COUNSEL, WITH THE OVERSIGHT OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, HAS BEEN

CONDUCTING AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES. THIS

REVIEW INITIALLY FOCUSED ON THE COMPANYS RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND WAS

COMMENCED AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF LITIGATION BROUGHT BY THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY

GENERALS OFFICE AGAINST A MAJOR BROKER.

THE INTERNAL REVIEW WAS

EXPANDED TO ADDRESS THE VARIOUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION DESCRIBED ABOVE AND TO

VERIFY WHETHER THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THESE AREAS HAVE BEEN

APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANYS REVIEW HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE, INVOLVING THE EXAMINATION

OF E-MAILS AND UNDERWRITING FILES, AS WELL AS INTERVIEWS OF CURRENT AND FORMER

EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO RECEIVE AND RESPOND TO ADDITIONAL

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND WILL EXPAND ITS REVIEW ACCORDINGLY.

TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS

FOUND ONLY A FEW INSTANCES OF CONDUCT THAT WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS

EMPLOYEE CODE OF CONDUCT. THE COMPANY HAS RESPONDED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO

RESPOND, APPROPRIATELY TO ANY SUCH CONDUCT.

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

REVIEW WITH RESPECT TO FINITE REINSURANCE CONSIDERED FINITE PRODUCTS THE

COMPANY BOTH PURCHASED AND SOLD. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED ITS REVIEW WITH

RESPECT TO THE IDENTIFIED FINITE PRODUCTS PURCHASED AND SOLD, AND HAS CONCLUDED

THAT NO ADJUSTMENT TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS REQUIRED.

EXCEPT AS SETTLED AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE

ONGOING, AS ARE THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUTHORITIES, AND

THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES COULD ASK THAT ADDITIONAL WORK BE PERFORMED OR REACH

CONCLUSIONS DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPANYS. ACCORDINGLY, IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO

REACH ANY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS.

FOUR PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS ARE PENDING AGAINST A NUMBER OF INSURANCE BROKERS AND INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, BY PLAINTIFFS WHO

ALLEGEDLY PURCHASED INSURANCE PRODUCTS THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE DEFENDANT

BROKERS. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT VARIOUS INSURANCE BROKERS CONSPIRED WITH EACH

OTHER AND WITH VARIOUS INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS

AFFILIATES, TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE PREMIUMS, ALLOCATE BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS AND

RIG BIDS FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS OFFERED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. THE COMPLAINTS ARE

CAPTIONED.

GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, HIGHWAY, AND

TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT V. MARSH & MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC., ET

AL.

(D.N.J. FEB. 23, 2005). TO THE EXTENT THEY WERE NOT

ORIGINALLY FILED THERE, THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTIONS WERE TRANSFERRED BY THE

JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY AND HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH OTHER CLASS

ACTIONS UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE INSURANCE

BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

, A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION

PROCEEDING IN THAT DISTRICT. ON AUGUST 1, 2005, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS,

INCLUDING THE FOUR NAMED PLAINTIFFS IN THE ABOVE-REFERENCED CLASS ACTIONS,

FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT NAMING VARIOUS BROKERS AND

INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, ON BEHALF OF A

PUTATIVE NATIONWIDE CLASS OF POLICYHOLDERS. THE COMPLAINT INCLUDES CAUSES OF

ACTION UNDER THE SHERMAN ACT, THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT

ORGANIZATIONS ACT (RICO), STATE COMMON LAW AND THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS STATES

PROHIBITING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. PLAINTIFFS SEEK MONETARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING

PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND TREBLED DAMAGES, PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, RESTITUTION,

INCLUDING DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS, INTEREST AND COSTS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS

FEES. ON NOVEMBER 29, 2005, ALL DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT

FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM. ORAL ARGUMENTS ON THE DEFENDANTS MOTION TO

DISMISS WERE HEARD ON JULY 26, 2006. ON OCTOBER 3, 2006, THE COURT

RULED THAT THE COMPLAINT FAILED TO PLEAD ACTIONABLE CLAIMS UNDER THE SHERMAN

ACT OR RICO, PROVIDED PLAINTIFFS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPLEAD THOSE CLAIMS AND

RESERVED DECISION WITH RESPECT TO REMAINING STATE LAW CLAIMS. ON NOVEMBER 30,

2006, DEFENDANTS RENEWED THEIR MOTIONS TO DISMISS. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2006,

THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS MOVED TO CERTIFY A NATIONWIDE CLASS CONSISTING OF ALL

PERSONS WHO BETWEEN AUGUST 26, 1994 AND THE DATE OF CLASS CERTIFICATION

ENGAGED THE SERVICES OF A BROKER DEFENDANT (OR RELATED ENTITY) IN CONNECTION

WITH THE PROCUREMENT OR RENEWAL OF INSURANCE AND WHO ENTERED INTO OR RENEWED A

CONTRACT OF INSURANCE WITH ONE OR MORE OF THE INSURER DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING THE

COMPANY. THE RENEWED MOTION TO DISMISS AND CLASS CERTIFICATION MOTION REMAIN

PENDING. ALSO, ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN STATE AND

FEDERAL COURTS AGAINST THE COMPANY INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

AND FURTHER

ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NO

MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY.

IN ADDITION TO THOSE

DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS, NOT INVOLVING

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, ARISING MOSTLY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS OPERATIONS EITHER AS A LIABILITY INSURER DEFENDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS

BROUGHT AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, OR AS AN INSURER DEFENDING CLAIMS BROUGHT

AGAINST IT RELATING TO COVERAGE OR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES. WHILE THE

ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT, NONE WOULD LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

ON JULY 23, 2004, THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION

OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATE PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $1.63

BILLION ($1.07 BILLION AFTER-TAX). THE COMPANY RECORDED THESE ADJUSTMENTS AS

CHARGES IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004.

THROUGH AN INFORMAL COMMENT PROCESS, THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION

FINANCE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, WHICH THE COMPANY HAS

PROVIDED. SPECIFICALLY, THE STAFF HAS ASKED FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE

COMPANYS ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN OF SPCS INSURANCE RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND PREMIUMS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AND HOW THOSE

ADJUSTMENTS MAY RELATE TO SPCS RESERVES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER OF SPC

AND TPC. AFTER REVIEWING THE STAFFS

62

QUESTIONS

AND COMMENTS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

FOR THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE. IF, HOWEVER, THE STAFF DISAGREES, SOME OR

ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS BEING DISCUSSED MAY NOT BE RECORDED AS CHARGES IN THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, THEREBY INCREASING NET INCOME FOR

THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2004 AND INCREASING SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, 2005 AND 2004, IN EACH CASE BY THE APPROXIMATE AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF THE

CHANGE. THE EFFECT ON TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTS

OF DEFERRED TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, 2005 AND 2004 WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL. INCREASES TO GOODWILL AND DEFERRED

TAX LIABILITIES WOULD BE REFLECTED ON THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET AS OF APRIL 1,

2004, EITHER DUE TO PURCHASE ACCOUNTING OR ADJUSTMENT OF SPCS RESERVES PRIOR

TO THE MERGER OF SPC AND TPC. ON MAY 3, 2006, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A

LETTER FROM THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE SEC (THE DIVISION) ADVISING

THE COMPANY THAT IT IS CONDUCTING AN INQUIRY RELATING TO THE SECOND QUARTER

2004 ADJUSTMENTS AND THE APRIL 1, 2004 MERGER OF SPC AND TPC. THE COMPANY

IS COOPERATING WITH THE DIVISIONS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.

RESULTS PRIOR TO DIVESTITURE WAS CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, ALONG

WITH THE NET AFTER-TAX LOSS ON DISPOSAL. PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS WERE RECLASSIFIED

TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE 2005 PRESENTATION.

(5)

IN MARCH 2002, TPC ISSUED COMMON STOCK THROUGH ITS

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO). TPC ISSUED 231 MILLION SHARES OF ITS CLASS A

COMMON STOCK, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 23% OF TPCS COMMON EQUITY. AFTER THE

IPO, CITIGROUP INC. BENEFICIALLY OWNED ALL OF THE 500 MILLION SHARES OF TPCS

OUTSTANDING CLASS B COMMON STOCK, EACH SHARE OF WHICH WAS ENTITLED TO SEVEN

VOTES, AND 269 MILLION SHARES OF TPCS CLASS A COMMON STOCK, EACH SHARE OF

WHICH WAS ENTITLED TO ONE VOTE, REPRESENTING AT THE TIME 94% OF THE COMBINED

VOTING POWER OF ALL CLASSES OF TPCS VOTING SECURITIES AND 77% OF THE EQUITY

INTEREST IN TPC. ON AUGUST 20, 2002, CITIGROUP MADE A TAX-FREE

DISTRIBUTION TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS (THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION), OF A PORTION OF

ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TPC, WHICH, TOGETHER WITH THE SHARES ISSUED IN THE

IPO, REPRESENTED MORE THAN 90% OF TPCS COMMON EQUITY AND MORE THAN 90% OF THE

COMBINED VOTING POWER OF TPCS OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES. CITIGROUP

RECEIVED A PRIVATE LETTER RULING FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE THAT THE

CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION WAS TAX-FREE TO CITIGROUP, ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND TPC. AS

PART OF THE RULING PROCESS, CITIGROUP AGREED TO VOTE THE SHARES IT CONTINUED TO

HOLD OF TPC FOLLOWING THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION PRO RATA WITH THE SHARES HELD

BY THE PUBLIC AND TO DIVEST THE REMAINING SHARES IT HOLDS WITHIN FIVE YEARS

FOLLOWING THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION. AFTER THE MERGER, THIS UNDERTAKING ALSO

APPLIED TO SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, CITIGROUP

HELD FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT NONE OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.

(6)

DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE REFLECT THE RECAPITALIZATION

EFFECTED AS PART OF TPCS CORPORATE REORGANIZATION IN 2002. DURING 2002, TPC

PAID DIVIDENDS OF $5.10 BILLION IN THE FORM OF A NOTE PAYABLE AND $158 MILLION

IN CASH TO CITIGROUP, ITS THEN SOLE SHAREHOLDER.

THE FOLLOWING IS A

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES,

THE COMPANY). ON APRIL 1, 2004, TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC)

MERGED WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. (SPC), AS A

RESULT OF WHICH TPC BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF SPC, AND SPC CHANGED

TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE ACQUISITION WITH TPC TREATED AS THE

ACCOUNTING ACQUIRER. ACCORDINGLY, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION, USING TPC HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND

APPLYING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND

COMMITMENTS OF SPC AS OF APRIL 1, 2004. BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004,

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF SPC WERE CONSOLIDATED WITH

TPCS. ACCORDINGLY, ALL FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN FOR THE TWELVE

THEIR EFFECT WAS ANTI-DILUTIVE.

THE COMPANYS DISCUSSIONS

RELATED TO ALL ITEMS, OTHER THAN NET INCOME, INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS,

INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, AND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

(LOSS), ARE PRESENTED ON A PRETAX BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. THROUGHOUT THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION, THE COMPANY REFERENCES THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER IN THE

CONTEXT OF A COMPARISON BETWEEN 2005 AND 2004, REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT THE

COMPANYS 2005 RESULTS REFLECTED A FULL YEAR OF COMBINED POST-MERGER

OPERATIONS, WHEREAS THE COMPANYS 2004 RESULTS REFLECTED COMBINED POST-MERGER

OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS SUBSEQUENT TO THE APRIL 1, 2004 MERGER

DATE, PLUS THE RESULTS OF TPC ONLY FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,

2004.

OVERVIEW

INCOME FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS IN 2006 TOTALED $4.21 BILLION, OR $5.91 PER SHARE DILUTED, COMPARED

WITH 2005 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $2.06 BILLION, OR $2.95 PER

SHARE DILUTED. THE $2.15 BILLION INCREASE IN 2006 OPERATING RESULTS REFLECTED A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR

70

YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, STRONG GROWTH IN INVESTMENT INCOME AND HIGHER BUSINESS

VOLUME. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND A DECLINE IN FEE INCOME. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2006

TOTALED $103 MILLION, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM SEVERAL WIND, RAIN, HAIL AND

SNOW STORMS IN THE UNITED STATES, WHEREAS RESULTS IN 2005 INCLUDED $2.19

BILLION OF CATASTROPHE COSTS, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA

AND WILMA. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $394 MILLION IN

2006 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM BETTER THAN EXPECTED PERSONAL AUTO BODILY INJURY

LOSS EXPERIENCE AND A DECLINE IN THE FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED

LOSSES IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE

SEGMENT, FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT ON 2005 CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN PERSONAL INSURANCE

AND CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN LIABILITY AND PROPERTY LINES OF BUSINESS IN THE

BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT. THIS FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASES IN

RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS,

ALL IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 OF $325 MILLION WAS DRIVEN BY A CHARGE TO STRENGTHEN

ASBESTOS RESERVES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OTHER NON-ASBESTOS RELATED NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN ALL THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS IN 2005 TOTALED $2.06 BILLION, OR $2.95 PER SHARE DILUTED, COMPARED

WITH INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $867 MILLION, OR $1.40 PER SHARE

DILUTED, IN 2004. THE INCREASE IN INCOME IN 2005 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE

MERGER, IMPROVED NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED CURRENT YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE

COMPANYS THREE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, A DECLINE IN NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND STRONG GROWTH IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME. THESE

FACTORS MORE THAN OFFSET A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE COST OF CATASTROPHES,

WHICH TOTALED $2.19 BILLION IN 2005, COMPARED WITH $772 MILLION IN 2004. THE

CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2004 WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FOUR HURRICANES THAT

STRUCK THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES IN THE THIRD QUARTER. NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 TOTALED $325 MILLION, COMPARED WITH NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $2.39 BILLION IN 2004.

THE NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2004

WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL &

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENTS. NET UNFAVORABLE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE

BUSINESS INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL

INSURANCE SEGMENTS IN 2004 MORE THAN OFFSET ADDITIONAL INCOME RESULTING FROM

THE MERGER AND STRONG OPERATING INCOME GENERATED BY THE COMPANYS PERSONAL

INSURANCE SEGMENT.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY SOLD

ITS EQUITY INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, WHICH CONSTITUTED ITS ASSET

MANAGEMENT SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

OF $439 MILLION, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF $710 MILLION OF TAX EXPENSE WHICH

RESULTED FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS AND THE GAAP CARRYING VALUE

OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $224

MILLION AFTER-TAX GAIN ON THE DIVESTITURE AND THE COMPANYS SHARE OF NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS NET INCOME FOR 2005. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF $88

MILLION IN 2004 REPRESENTED THE COMPANYS SHARE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET

INCOME FOR THE YEAR.

REVENUES

EARNED PREMIUMS

EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2006

TOTALED $20.76 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $419 MILLION, OR 2%, OVER THE 2005 TOTAL

OF $20.34 BILLION. EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2006 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY AN

INCREASE IN PROPERTY CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COSTS. EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2005

WERE REDUCED BY $121 MILLION OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS, WHICH REPRESENT

ADDITIONAL PREMIUMS PAYABLE TO REINSURERS TO MAINTAIN COVERAGE LIMITS FOR

CERTAIN EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATIES. IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT,

EARNED PREMIUM GROWTH OF 9% IN 2006 REFLECTED STRONG NEW BUSINESS VOLUME AND

CONTINUED RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES. IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, EARNED

PREMIUMS IN 2006 DECLINED 2% FROM THE COMPARABLE 2005 TOTAL, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF BUSINESS IN RUNOFF AND THE SALE OF THE PERSONAL

CATASTROPHE RISK OPERATION IN NOVEMBER 2005. EARNED PREMIUMS IN THE

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT IN

71

2006

INCREASED 4% OVER 2005, PRIMARILY REFLECTING GROWTH IN BOND &

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND THE ABSENCE OF CATASTROPHE-RELATED REINSTATEMENT

PREMIUMS.

THE $1.30 BILLION INCREASE

IN EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2005 OVER 2004 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE

MERGER, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN EARNED PREMIUMS

IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENTS RUNOFF OPERATIONS AND A DECLINE IN CERTAIN

OF BUSINESS INSURANCES ONGOING OPERATIONS DUE TO A LOWER LEVEL OF NET WRITTEN

PREMIUM VOLUME IN THE LAST HALF OF 2004 AND FIRST HALF OF 2005. EARNED PREMIUMS

IN 2005 WERE REDUCED BY THE $121 MILLION OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS RELATED TO

CATASTROPHE LOSSES. EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2004 WERE REDUCED BY $76 MILLION OF

REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS PRIMARILY RELATED TO RESERVE CHARGES RECORDED IN THE

SURETY OPERATION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE FACTORS WERE THE IMPACTS OF NEW

BUSINESS GROWTH AND INCREASED RETENTION IN MANY OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

OPERATIONS IN 2005.

2006 OR 2005).

(B)

EXCLUDING

NET REALIZED AND UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

TOTALED $3.52 BILLION IN 2006, AN INCREASE OF $352 MILLION, OR 11%, OVER 2005

NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF $3.17 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN 2006 WAS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF HIGHER YIELDS ON SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TAXABLE SECURITIES,

CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE COMPANYS FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO RESULTING FROM

STRONG CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND A DECLINE IN INVESTMENT EXPENSES.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO INVESTMENT INCOME GROWTH IN 2006 WAS THE FULL-YEAR IMPACT

OF INVESTMENT RETURNS FROM THE INVESTMENT OF $2.40 BILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE

DIVESTITURE OF THE COMPANYS EQUITY INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS DURING 2005.

THE COMPANYS REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN

OTHER INVESTMENTS, ALSO PRODUCED STRONG LEVELS OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2006.

THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

TOTALED $62.24 BILLION, $3.63 BILLION HIGHER THAN YEAR-END 2005. THE AVERAGE

PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELD WAS 4.9% IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 4.7% IN 2005. THE

INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER YIELDS ON TAXABLE INVESTMENTS PURCHASED IN

2006 AND THE STRONG RETURNS GENERATED BY THE REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURE

INVESTMENTS.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF

$3.17 BILLION IN 2005 GREW $502 MILLION, OR 19%, OVER 2004, REFLECTING THE

IMPACT OF THE MERGER, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN INVESTED ASSETS OVER THE PRIOR

TWELVE MONTHS, HIGHER SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES AND A DECLINE IN

INVESTMENT EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN INVESTED ASSETS IN 2005 WAS DRIVEN BY

STRONG CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE INVESTMENT OF THE $2.40

BILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE DIVESTITURE OF THE COMPANYS EQUITY INTEREST IN

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS. THE AVERAGE PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELD IN 2005 OF 4.7%

DECLINED SLIGHTLY FROM 4.8% IN 2004, DUE TO THE MATURITY OF HIGHER YIELDING

BONDS AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS. NET INVESTMENT INCOME

IN 2004 INCLUDED $111 MILLION FROM THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF ONE

INVESTMENT.

THE COMPANY ALLOCATES

INVESTED ASSETS AND THE RELATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME TO ITS REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. PRETAX NET INVESTMENT INCOME IS ALLOCATED BASED UPON AN

INVESTABLE FUNDS CONCEPT, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT LIABILITIES (NET OF

NON-INVESTED ASSETS) AND APPROPRIATE CAPITAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR

72

EACH

SEGMENT. THE INVESTMENT YIELD FOR INVESTABLE FUNDS REFLECTS THE DURATION OF THE

LOSS RESERVES FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME THE

LOSSES WERE INCURRED AND A+ RATED CORPORATE DEBT INSTRUMENT YIELDS. THE

INVESTMENT YIELD FOR CAPITAL REFLECTS THE AVERAGE YIELD ON THE TOTAL INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO. IT IS THE APPLICATION OF THE YIELDS TO THE SEGMENTS INVESTABLE

FUNDS AND CAPITAL THAT DETERMINES THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS SHARE OF

ACTUAL NET INVESTMENT INCOME.

FEE INCOME

THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS

MARKET IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE COMPANYS

FEE-BASED BUSINESS. THE DECLINES IN FEE INCOME IN 2006 AND 2005 COMPARED WITH

THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEARS IS DESCRIBED IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT

DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS.

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES)

NET PRETAX REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS IN 2006 TOTALED $11 MILLION, COMPARED WITH NET PRETAX REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS OF $17 MILLION IN 2005. THE 2006 TOTAL INCLUDED $49 MILLION OF

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (NET OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $33 MILLION)

GENERATED BY THE VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO AND $30 MILLION OF NET REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS (WHICH REQUIRE A

DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET SETTLEMENT AND ARE USED TO SHORTEN THE DURATION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO). THESE GAINS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY

OFFSET BY $33 MILLION OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES FROM THE FIXED MATURITY

PORTFOLIO (INCLUDING $7 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES) AND $22 MILLION OF NET

REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS HOLDINGS OF STOCK PURCHASE

WARRANTS OF PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD., A PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY INCURRED NET REALIZED LOSSES OF $11 MILLION RELATED TO

THE DIVESTITURE OF TWO SMALL SUBSIDIARIES.

NET PRETAX REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS IN 2005 WERE PRIMARILY GENERATED FROM SALES OF VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS AND EQUITY SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REALIZED A PRETAX

GAIN OF $21 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF ITS PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK OPERATION

AND $13 MILLION OF PRETAX NET GAINS RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS.

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS IN 2005 WERE REDUCED BY $109 MILLION OF

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES, WHICH WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO AS

DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL LATER IN THIS DISCUSSION. THE COMPANYS NET PRETAX

REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES OF $39 MILLION IN 2004 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

TOTALING $80 MILLION. NET PRETAX REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) IN 2004

ALSO INCLUDED NET LOSSES OF $44 MILLION RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES

CONTRACTS.

FURTHER INFORMATION

REGARDING THE NATURE OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN EACH YEAR IS INCLUDED IN THE INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT SECTION LATER IN THIS DISCUSSION.

OTHER REVENUES

OTHER REVENUES IN ALL

PERIODS PRESENTED PRIMARILY CONSIST OF PREMIUM INSTALLMENT CHARGES. IN

ADDITION, OTHER REVENUES IN 2006 INCLUDED A $42 MILLION GAIN ON THE REDEMPTION

GROSS AND NET WRITTEN

PREMIUMS IN 2006 INCREASED 1% AND 4%, RESPECTIVELY, OVER 2005. THE DISPARITY

BETWEEN GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH RATES IN 2006 WAS CONCENTRATED IN

THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE

STRUCTURE OF REINSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE COMPANYS DISCOVER RE SUBSIDIARY THAT

RESULTED IN A DECLINE IN CEDED PREMIUMS. NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2006 WAS

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF PREMIUMS CEDED FOR THE COST OF

PROPERTY CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE, WHEREAS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 WERE

REDUCED BY $121 MILLION OF CATASTROPHE-RELATED REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS.

IN BUSINESS INSURANCE, NET

WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH IN 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG INCREASES IN TARGET RISK

UNDERWRITING, DUE TO SIGNIFICANT RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES FOR SOUTHEASTERN U.S.

CATASTROPHE-PRONE EXPOSURES, AND IN INDUSTRY-FOCUSED UNDERWRITING, DUE TO GROWTH

IN SEVERAL INDUSTRY SECTORS SERVED BY THIS MARKET. THAT GROWTH WAS LARGELY

OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN PREMIUM VOLUME FOR OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF, PRIMARILTY

DUE TO THE SALE OF THE PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK OPERATION IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2005. BUSINESS RETENTION RATES REMAINED STRONG THROUGHOUT THE

BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT IN 2006, AND NEW BUSINESS VOLUME INCREASED. IN

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE, WRITTEN PREMIUM

GROWTH IN 2006 REFLECTED STRONG BUSINESS VOLUME THROUGHOUT THE SEGMENT, AND THE

ABSENCE OF CATASTROPHE-RELATED REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS. NET WRITTEN PREMIUM

GROWTH IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT IN 2006 REFLECTED GROWTH IN NEW

BUSINESS VOLUME, RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES AND CONTINUED STRONG BUSINESS

RETENTION RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF TRANSITIONING TO

SIX-MONTH POLICY TERMS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR FOR A LARGE PORTION OF

THE COMPANYS MULTIVARIATE PRICING AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT, AND AN INCREASE IN CEDED

PREMIUMS FOR CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE.

GROSS AND NET WRITTEN

PREMIUMS IN 2005 BOTH INCREASED 7% OVER 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT

OF THE MERGER. HOWEVER, GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUMES IN 2005 WERE DOWN

WHEN COMPARED TO 2004 ON A PRO FORMA COMBINED BASIS. THE DECLINES WERE

CONCENTRATED IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, REFLECTING THE PLANNED

NON-RENEWAL OF BUSINESS IN RUNOFF AND REDUCED PREMIUM VOLUME IN CERTAIN ONGOING

OPERATIONS DUE TO COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, PREMIUM VOLUME IN

THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENTS CONSTRUCTION OPERATION WAS LOWER THAN IN 2004

ON A PRO FORMA BASIS DUE TO THE NOW-COMPLETED PROCESS OF ALIGNING THE

UNDERWRITING PROFILE OF THE TWO PREDECESSOR COMPANIES. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN

2005 WERE REDUCED BY $121 MILLION OF CATASTROPHE-RELATED REINSTATEMENT

PREMIUMS, WHEREAS 2004 NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME WAS REDUCED BY $76 MILLION OF

REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS PRIMARILY RELATED TO RESERVING ACTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL,

PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT. PREMIUM VOLUME IN THE

PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT INCREASED OVER 2004, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED RENEWAL

PRICE INCREASES AND GROWTH IN POLICIES IN FORCE IN THE HOMEOWNERS LINE OF

BUSINESS. DURING 2005, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION RATES

ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS, AS THE COMPANY FOCUSED ON RETAINING ITS EXISTING BOOK

OF WELL-PRICED, PROFITABLE BUSINESS. NEW BUSINESS LEVELS IN SEVERAL OF THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE OPERATIONS ALSO INCREASED OVER 2004. RATE INCREASES,

HOWEVER, WERE GENERALLY LOWER IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004, REFLECTING INCREASED

COMPETITION AND MORE AGGRESSIVE PRICING IN THE MARKETPLACE. RATES FOR CERTAIN

PRODUCTS IN SELECTED MARKETS DECLINED FROM 2004 LEVELS.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2005, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED CHANGES IN THE TIMING AND STRUCTURE OF

REINSURANCE PURCHASED IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL &

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENTS. THE CHANGES IN STRUCTURE RESULTED IN AN

INCREASE IN CEDED PREMIUMS IN 2005 WHEN COMPARED WITH 2004. THE COMPANY ALSO

MADE A MODEST ADJUSTMENT TO 2004 CEDED WRITTEN PREMIUMS TO REPORT AT INCEPTION

ALL CEDED WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE MINIMUM AMOUNTS

REQUIRED TO BE CEDED. PREVIOUSLY, CEDED WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR CERTAIN OF THESE

AGREEMENTS WERE REPORTED OVER THE LIFE OF THE

74

CONTRACTS.

THIS ADJUSTMENT AFFECTED ONLY THE STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE OF NET WRITTEN

PREMIUMS ON A QUARTER-BY-QUARTER BASIS; IT DID NOT AFFECT NET WRITTEN

PREMIUM AMOUNTS OVER THE LIVES OF THE RESPECTIVE AGREEMENTS, NOR DID IT IMPACT

GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS, EARNED PREMIUMS, OPERATING RESULTS OR CAPITAL. THE

ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE TO CONFORM THE STATISTICAL MEASUREMENT OF PRODUCTIONNET

WRITTEN PREMIUMSACROSS THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES.

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TOTALED $12.24 BILLION IN 2006, $2.68 BILLION LESS THAN THE

2005 TOTAL OF $14.93 BILLION. THE 2006 TOTAL INCLUDED $103 MILLION OF

CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND $394 MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT, WHEREAS THE 2005 TOTAL INCLUDED $2.03 BILLION OF CATASTROPHE

LOSSES AND $325 MILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. CATASTROPHE

LOSSES IN 2005 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA AND WILMA. NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE

PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, PRIMARILY REFLECTING BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS

EXPERIENCE IN THE AUTO BODILY INJURY AND NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED HOMEOWNERS AND

OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS, AND A REDUCTION IN LOSS ESTIMATES FOR THE 2005

HURRICANES. THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT ALSO EXPERIENCED NET FAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS IN 2006, PRIMARILY IN THE

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL, GENERAL LIABILITY, PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

LINES OF BUSINESS. THAT FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES

TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN

THE ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

SECTIONS HEREIN. THERE WAS ALSO UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN

RUNOFF ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS. IN 2005, THE NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT AND WAS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE TO ASBESTOS RESERVES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY OTHER, NON-ASBESTOS RELATED NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN ALL THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES OF $14.93 BILLION IN 2005 WERE $512 MILLION LOWER THAN THE

2004 TOTAL OF $15.44 BILLION. THE 2005 TOTAL INCLUDED $2.03 BILLION OF

CATASTROPHE LOSSES, COMPARED WITH $761 MILLION OF SUCH LOSSES IN 2004. THE COST

OF CATASTROPHES IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE. THE

2005 TOTAL ALSO INCLUDED $325 MILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, COMPARED WITH $2.39 BILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2004. CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN

2005 ALSO REFLECTED IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR NON-CATASTROPHE

RELATED LOSS EXPERIENCE AS COMPARED WITH 2004.

THE 2004 NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT OF $2.39 BILLION INCLUDED A $928 MILLION CHARGE TO INCREASE

ASBESTOS RESERVES AND A $290 MILLION CHARGE TO INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

IN ADDITION, THE 2004 TOTAL INCLUDED CHARGES TO INCREASE

THE ACQUIRED NET CONSTRUCTION AND SURETY RESERVES BY $500 MILLION AND $300

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND A CHARGE OF $252 MILLION RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION

PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR LOSS

DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THESE THREE ITEMS IN 2004, AS WELL AS OTHER RESERVING

ACTIONS.

UPON HAVING ACCESS TO EACH COMPANYS DETAILED

POLICYHOLDER INFORMATION, INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, AND ACTUARIAL FILES ON

APRIL 1, 2004, IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER, THE COMPANY

WAS ABLE TO BEGIN THE DETAILED PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A UNIFORM AND CONSISTENT

APPROACH TO ESTIMATING THE COMBINED COMPANYS LOSS RESERVES. AS PART OF THAT

PROCESS, A TEAM OF ACTUARIES REPRESENTING THE HISTORICAL ACTUARIAL

PERSPECTIVES, JUDGMENTS AND METHODS APPLIED BY EACH LEGACY COMPANY, DISCUSSED

THEIR VIEWS, METHODOLOGIES, AND ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE DATA.

IN ADDITION TO THE DISCUSSION IN THE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

SECTION OF

THIS REPORT, OTHER ITEMS SPECIFICALLY CONSIDERED IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A

UNIFORM AND CONSISTENT APPROACH TO ESTIMATING THE COMBINED COMPANYS LOSS

RESERVES AFTER THE MERGER INCLUDED INTERPRETING THE ACTUARIAL AND CLAIM DATA IN

A

75

UNIFORM MANNER AND DETERMINING

AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF DATA SEGMENTATION FOR ESTIMATION PURPOSES. THIS TYPE OF

ANALYSIS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND CAN, AND OFTEN DOES, LEAD TO

RESERVE ESTIMATES THAT DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE OF PRIOR PERIODS,

PARTICULARLY IN LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY AND COMPLEX EXPOSURES. IN

ADDITION, SINCE THE RESERVING PROCESS ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE

OUTCOMES, THE ACTUARIES INVOLVED HAD TO ANALYZE THEIR DIFFERING VIEWS ON KEY

ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS PREDICTING INFLATION, ESTIMATING CLAIM DEVELOPMENT

PATTERNS AND DETERMINING EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO JUDICIAL RULINGS AND

INTERPRETATIONS, AMONG OTHERS. THIS INFORMED JUDGMENT IS BROUGHT INTO THE

PROCESS BY INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS ACTUARIES, UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM ADJUSTERS, AND

COMPANY MANAGEMENT. ULTIMATELY, THIS PROCESS REQUIRED AN ANALYSIS OF THE

VARYING ACTUARIAL JUDGMENTS AND FORWARD-LOOKING ASSESSMENTS. THE RESULT WAS

SIMILAR TO A SINGLE, ONGOING INSURANCE ENTERPRISE OBTAINING MORE INFORMATION IN

A REPORTING PERIOD THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY AND IDENTIFYING A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE

IN ITS INSURANCE RESERVES IN THAT PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

$500 MILLION AND $300 MILLION CHARGE FOR CONSTRUCTION AND SURETY, RESPECTIVELY,

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004.

CONSTRUCTION

RESERVES.

BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, UPON

THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER, PERSONNEL FROM THE PREDECESSOR COMPANIES WERE

ABLE TO SHARE DETAILED POLICYHOLDER INFORMATION, CLAIM FILES AND ACTUARIAL DATA

RELATED TO THE ACQUIRED CONSTRUCTION RESERVES. THIS ENABLED AN ANALYSIS TO BE

PERFORMED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE ACQUIRED CONSTRUCTION RESERVES USING

TPCS LONG-ESTABLISHED PRACTICES THAT INCLUDES EVALUATING EXPOSURES BY TYPE OF

CLAIM (E.G. CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, CONSTRUCTION WRAP-UP, OTHER), BY TYPE OF

COVERAGE (E.G. GUARANTEED COST, LOSS RESPONSIVE, OTHER) AND BY DETAILED LINE OF

BUSINESS (GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL AUTO, ETC.), AMONG OTHERS. FOR GENERAL

LIABILITY EXPOSURES, WHICH INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT AND CONSTRUCTION

WRAP-UP, INTERPRETATION OF UNDERLYING TRENDS (BOTH PRESENT AND FUTURE) AND THE

RELATED RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS IS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL DUE TO THE LOW

FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY AND COMPLEX NATURE OF THESE EXPOSURES. IN PARTICULAR,

FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO

WHETHER COVERAGE EXISTS, WHEN LOSSES OCCUR, THE SIZE OF EACH LOSS, EXPECTATIONS

FOR FUTURE INTERPRETIVE RULINGS CONCERNING CONTRACT PROVISIONS AND THE EXTENT

TO WHICH THE ASSERTION OF THESE CLAIMS WILL EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY. AS A RESULT,

MATERIAL VARIATIONS CAN AND DO OCCUR AMONG ACTUARIAL RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR

THESE TYPES OF EXPOSURES. IN A MERGER, THESE DIFFERENCES ARE LIKELY TO BE EVEN

MORE PRONOUNCED. PRIOR TO A MERGER, EACH LEGACY COMPANY CONSISTENTLY APPLIES

ITS ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ACTUARIAL METHODS TO ESTIMATE RESERVES.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ACTUARIAL METHODS NEED TO

BE UNDERSTOOD AND RECONCILED, AND A UNIFORM APPROACH NEEDS TO BE ADOPTED FOR

THE MERGED ENTITY. IN THIS SITUATION, MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS CAN AND DO OCCUR FOR

RESERVES RELATED TO EXPOSURES HAVING A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY.

ANALYSIS OF THE ACQUIRED CONSTRUCTION RESERVES WAS

COMPLETED NEAR THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF

THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ACQUIRED NET

CONSTRUCTION RESERVES BY $500 MILLION, INCLUDING $400 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION

DEFECT AND $100 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION WRAP-UP CLAIMS, AND RECOGNIZED THIS

CHANGE IN ESTIMATE AS AN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGE IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THERE

WAS NO REINSURANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHARGE.

SURETY

RESERVES.

PERSONNEL FROM THE PREDECESSOR

COMPANIES WERE ALSO ABLE TO SHARE DETAILED SPC POLICYHOLDER INFORMATION RELATED

TO SURETY RESERVES UPON COMPLETION OF THE MERGER. ACCESS TO THIS DETAILED INFORMATION

ENABLED THE COMPANY TO PERFORM A CLAIM-BY-CLAIM REVIEW OF RESERVES AND CLAIMS

HANDLING STRATEGIES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004 USING THE COMBINED

EXPERTISE OF CLAIMS ADJUSTERS FROM THE LEGACY COMPANIES. THIS TYPE OF REVIEW

INVOLVES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

WITHIN WHICH CLAIMS WILL BE SETTLED, ESTIMATES FOR DATES OF LOSS OCCURRENCE AND

EVALUATIONS OF IBNR EXPOSURES FOR EACH INSURED. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF THE

DETAILED INFORMATION OBTAINED CONCERNING CONTRACTORS WITH REPORTED CLAIMS, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERED WHETHER OR NOT LOSSES WERE INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED ON

ONE OR MORE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS FOR EACH CONTRACTOR EXAMINED.

ALSO ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE COMPANY COULD BEGIN TO

USE THIS DETAILED INFORMATION TO COMPARE SPCS ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND

ACTUARIAL METHODS THAT WERE UNDERLYING THE ACQUIRED RESERVES WITH ITS OWN

76

ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND

ACTUARIAL METHODS. SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND TO EXIST.

SIMILARITIES INCLUDED, BUT WERE NOT LIMITED TO, RECOGNIZING CLAIM RESERVES WHEN

IT WAS DETERMINED THAT CONTRACTORS AND COMMERCIAL SURETY INSUREDS WERE IN

DEFAULT AND THEREBY UNABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, ESTIMATING INITIAL IBNR

PROVISIONS, AND PERIODICALLY RE-EVALUATING, AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ADEQUACY OF

THE RESERVES ESTABLISHED BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIMS RECORDED AND REVISED ESTIMATES

OF IBNR. DIFFERENCES INCLUDED JUDGMENTS AND METHODS RELATED TO DETERMINING IBNR

DEVELOPMENT FACTORS AND EXPECTED SALVAGE, AMONG OTHERS.

THAT THESE DIFFERENCES EXIST IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR SURETY

RESERVE ESTIMATES. SURETY IS A LINE OF BUSINESS FOR WHICH THERE ARE LOW

FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY, VERY COMPLEX CLAIMS FOR CERTAIN EXPOSURES,

PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS AND COMMERCIAL

SURETY INSUREDS. DETERMINING THE DATE OF LOSS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRES A

HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, THE CLAIM RESERVE ESTIMATES EVEN FOR

REPORTED CLAIMS ARE ALSO HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL. THESE TWO FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS,

COMBINE TO MAKE IBNR RESERVE ESTIMATIONS FOR SURETY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. DUE TO

THIS HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY, THE INFORMED JUDGMENTS OF DIFFERENT ACTUARIES

COULD AND DO VARY MATERIALLY. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN A MERGER, THESE

DIFFERENCES ARE LIKELY TO BE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED.

THE CLAIM REVIEWS AND ACTUARIAL ANALYSES WERE BOTH

COMPLETED NEAR THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF

THESE REVIEWS AND ANALYSES, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ACQUIRED

SURETY RESERVES BY $300 MILLION, NET OF $170 MILLION OF REINSURANCE, AND

RECOGNIZED THIS CHANGE IN ESTIMATE AS AN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGE IN THE SECOND

QUARTER.

CHARGE

RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER AND BEGINNING IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2003, SPC DISCLOSED THAT A LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR FOR WHICH

IT HAD WRITTEN SEVERAL SURETY BONDS WAS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY.

BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE CONSTRUCTION

CONTRACTOR THAT WAS PERFORMED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, A RESTRUCTURING

PLAN WAS ADOPTED BY THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, ITS BANKS, AND SPC, AMONG

OTHERS, AS A MEANS TO MINIMIZE ESTIMATED LOSSES. SPC MONITORED THE PROGRESS OF

THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR TOWARD MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RESTRUCTURING

PLAN THROUGHOUT SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS. SPC ALSO ESTIMATED AND DISCLOSED ITS

ESTIMATED ULTIMATE NET LOSSES RELATED TO THIS EXPOSURE, BEGINNING IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2003 AND UPDATED EACH QUARTER THEREAFTER, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF

ADVANCES MADE OR EXPECTED TO BE MADE TO THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, APPLICABLE

COLLATERAL, CO-SURETY PARTICIPATIONS AND REINSURANCE. THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY

OF THESE PARTICULAR CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS, COUPLED WITH THE DETERIORATING

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR AND THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY AS

TO WHETHER IT WOULD MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN, RESULTED IN

A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSSES.

A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS THAT BEGAN IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2004 WAS COMPLETED DURING THE LAST HALF OF THE SECOND QUARTER. BASED

UPON THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE CONTRACTOR WOULD NOT BE ABLE

TO MEET THE TARGETS SET FORTH IN ITS BUSINESS AND RESTRUCTURING PLANS.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY MOVED FROM SUPPORTING THE CONTRACTORS RESTRUCTURING

PLAN TO ADOPTING A WORKOUT PLAN AS A MEANS TO MINIMIZE ESTIMATED LOSSES. UNDER

THE WORKOUT PLAN, THE COMPANY WOULD NO LONGER PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SURETY BONDS

FOR NEW PROJECTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR. ALSO AS PART OF THE WORKOUT PLAN,

THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING AND ENGINEERING

PROCEDURES FOR EACH OPEN PROJECT, WHICH INCLUDED USING SPECIALISTS TO IMPLEMENT

ADDITIONAL FORECASTING, CASH MANAGEMENT, AND REPORTING PROCEDURES, ON BOTH A

PROJECT-BY-PROJECT AND CONSOLIDATED LEVEL. BASED UPON THIS SECOND QUARTER

CHANGE TO A WORKOUT PLAN AND THE DETAILED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS THAT WAS ABLE TO

BE PERFORMED, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE NET LOSS BY

$252 MILLION, INCLUDING $9 MILLION OF REINSURANCE. THIS ESTIMATE TOOK INTO

CONSIDERATION PAID AMOUNTS, NET RECEIVABLES, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, OVERHEAD

COSTS, ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPLACING

THE CONTRACTOR, RECEIVABLE DISCOUNTS, CURRENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS FROM OWNERS AND

SUBCONTRACTORS AGAINST THE CONTRACTOR, AND THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL, AMONG

OTHERS.

77

THE COMPANY ALSO COMMUTED

CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER IN 2004 RESULTING IN A

$113 MILLION PRIOR YEAR RESERVE CHARGE (IN ADDITION TO A CURRENT YEAR LOSS OF

$40 MILLION). COMMUTATIONS ARE A COMPLETE AND FINAL SETTLEMENT WITH A REINSURER

THAT RESULTS IN A DISCHARGE OF ALL OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE TERMINATED

REINSURANCE AGREEMENT.

COST OF CATASTROPHES.

IN

2006, THE COST OF CATASTROPHES TOTALED $103 MILLION (NET OF REINSURANCE), ALL

OF WHICH WAS INCURRED IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT AND RESULTED FROM

SEVERAL

WIND, RAIN, HAIL AND SNOW

STORMS IN THE UNITED STATES

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN 2005, THE

COMPANYS COST OF CATASTROPHES, NET OF REINSURANCE AND INCLUDING REINSTATEMENT

PREMIUMS OF $121 MILLION AND STATE ASSESSMENTS OF $43 MILLION, TOTALED $2.19

BILLION, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA AND WILMA. REINSTATEMENT

PREMIUMS REPRESENT ADDITIONAL PREMIUMS PAYABLE TO REINSURERS TO RESTORE

COVERAGE LIMITS THAT HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AS A RESULT OF REINSURED LOSSES UNDER

CERTAIN EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATIES AND ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF

NET WRITTEN AND EARNED PREMIUMS. THE MAJORITY OF CATASTROPHE COSTS IN 2005 WERE

INCURRED IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT ($1.41 BILLION) AND IN THE PERSONAL

INSURANCE SEGMENT ($593 MILLION) IN 2004, THE COST OF CATASTROPHES, NET OF

REINSURANCE, TOTALED $772 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH RESULTED FROM FOUR HURRICANESCHARLEY,

FRANCES, IVAN AND JEANNETHAT ALSO MADE LANDFALL IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED

STATES.

78

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES TOTALED $3.46 BILLION IN 2006, AN INCREASE OF $229 MILLION, OR 7%,

OVER THE COMPARABLE 2005 TOTAL OF $3.23 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN 2006 WAS

DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS MADE THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH

AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, COSTS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS NATIONAL ADVERTISING

CAMPAIGN AND LEGAL EXPENSES RELATED TO INVESTIGATIONS OF VARIOUS BUSINESS

PRACTICES BY CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES (SEE ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS). THESE

FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF

CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR STATE TAX MATTERS, CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS, THE ABSENCE OF

CATASTROPHE-RELATED STATE ASSESSMENTS AND LOWER PREMIUM TAX-RELATED EXPENSES.

THE $284 MILLION INCREASE

IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 PRIMARILY

REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE 2005 TOTAL INCLUDED $43

MILLION OF STATE ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, AND ALSO REFLECTED

INVESTMENTS MADE FOR PROCESS RE-ENGINEERING AND TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT. THESE FACTORS

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE BENEFIT OF EXPENSE EFFICIENCIES ACHIEVED SINCE THE

COMPLETION OF THE MERGER. INCLUDED IN THE 2005 AND 2004 TOTALS WERE $112

MILLION AND $92 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO

FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, AND A BENEFIT OF $12

MILLION AND $58 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCRETION OF THE

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES AND REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES. THE 2004 TOTAL INCLUDED A $62 MILLION INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE

FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS FOR LOSS-SENSITIVE BUSINESS

(PRIMARILY HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS). THIS INCREASE RESULTED FROM APPLYING THE

COMPANYS CREDIT-BASED METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS TO THE

RECOVERABLES ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN

2004 ALSO INCLUDED $29 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO THE MERGER.

OTHER 2004 CLAIMS AND

EXPENSES.

OTHER ITEMS INCREASING THE 2004 CLAIMS

AND EXPENSES INCLUDED $296 MILLION OF CHARGES TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCES FOR

ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES,

POLICYHOLDERS RECEIVABLES, AND CO-SURETY PARTICIPATIONS ON A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION

CONTRACTOR CLAIM. THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES RECOGNIZED A CHANGE IN ESTIMATED DISPUTES WITH REINSURERS AND IS

BASED UPON THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE STRATEGY OF REDUCED REINSURANCE

UTILIZATION, INCLUDING THE CESSATION OF ONGOING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CERTAIN OF SPCS REINSURERS, AND AGGRESSIVE COLLECTION OF REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES. A CHARGE WAS ALSO RECORDED TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED

UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS FOR LOSS SENSITIVE BUSINESS

(PRIMARILY HIGH DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS). THIS INCREASE RECOGNIZED A CHANGE IN

ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE AND RESULTED FROM APPLYING THE COMPANYS

CREDIT BASED METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS TO THE

RECOVERABLES ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER. BECAUSE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND

AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS FOR LOSS SENSITIVE BUSINESS ARE INSURANCE

CONTRACT-RELATED ASSETS, THESE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME TYPES OF

ESTIMATION VARIABLES AS LOSS RESERVES.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2004, A PARTICIPATING CO-SURETY ON THE SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR

DESCRIBED ABOVE ANNOUNCED THAT INSURANCE REGULATORS HAD APPROVED ITS SUBMITTED

RUN-OFF PLAN. BASED UPON INDUSTRYS KNOWLEDGE OF THE CO-SURETYS RUN-OFF PLAN

AND THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED

THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY TO COLLECT THE FULL AMOUNT PROJECTED TO BE OWED BY THE

CO-SURETY AND ESTABLISHED AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESERVES. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, THE

COMPANY REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE CO-SURETY WHEREBY THE CO-SURETY MADE A

PAYMENT TO THE COMPANY AND WAS RELEASED FROM FURTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO

THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION EXPOSURE. THE

SETTLEMENT PAYMENT, COUPLED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED CO-SURETY RESERVES,

APPROXIMATED THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF THE CO-SURETYS SHARE OF THE BONDED

LOSSES RELATED TO THIS EXPOSURE.

INTEREST EXPENSE

INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2006

WAS $38 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ISSUANCE IN NOVEMBER 2005

OF $400 MILLION, 5.50% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 1, 2015, AND THE ISSUANCE

IN JUNE 2006

79

OF $400

MILLION, 6.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 20, 2016 AND $400 MILLION, 6.75%

SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 20, 2036. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE 2006 DEBT ISSUANCES

WERE USED TO FUND THE REDEMPTION AND MATURITY IN 2006 OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

OUTSTANDING DEBT.

THE $50 MILLION INCREASE

IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2005 OVER 2004 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF A FULL

YEAR OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON SPC DEBT ASSUMED IN THE MERGER ON APRIL 1,

2004. THE COMPANYS DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 DECLINED BY A

NET $463 MILLION COMPARED WITH YEAR-END 2004.

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE ON INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS 26.5%, 22.8% AND 7.3% IN

2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2006 AND 2005 EFFECTIVE RATE REFLECTED A

HIGHER LEVEL OF PRETAX INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH PROFITABLE UNDERWRITING

PERFORMANCE. THE LOW 2004 EFFECTIVE RATE PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF

NONTAXABLE INVESTMENT INCOME ON A LOWER LEVEL OF PRETAX INCOME.

GAAP COMBINED RATIOS

THE CONSOLIDATED LOSS AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 57.5% IN 2006 IMPROVED BY 14.4 POINTS COMPARED

WITH 2005, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE DECLINE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES. CATASTROPHE

LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR 0.5 POINTS OF THE 2006 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RATIO, COMPARED WITH A 10.3 POINT IMPACT IN 2005. THE 2006 LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO INCLUDED A 1.9 POINT IMPACT FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, WHEREAS THE 2005 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RATIO INCLUDED A 1.6 POINT IMPACT FROM NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT. THE 2006 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO EXCLUDING

CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IMPROVED OVER THE 2005

RATIO ON THE SAME BASIS, REFLECTING IMPROVEMENT IN FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY

TRENDS IN SEVERAL LINES OF BUSINESS. THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO FOR 2006

WAS 1.2 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IN 2005. THE CHANGES

PRIMARILY REFLECT THE IMPACT OF THE INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY. IN ADDITION, THE 2006 RATIO WAS NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY A DECLINE IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FEE INCOME, A PORTION OF WHICH IS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF EXPENSES FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE EXPENSE

RATIO. THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IN 2005 ALSO INCLUDED A 0.4 POINT IMPACT

FROM REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS AND STATE ASSESSMENTS.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES

ACCOUNTED FOR 10.3 POINTS OF THE 2005 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO,

COMPARED WITH 4.0 POINTS IN 2004. THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN

2005 INCLUDED A 1.6 POINT IMPACT OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT, WHEREAS THE 2004 RATIO INCLUDED A 12.6 POINT IMPACT OF NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE 2005 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RATIO ALSO REFLECTED AN IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR

NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED LOSS EXPERIENCE, COMPARED WITH 2004, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING REDUCED CLAIM ACTIVITY. THE 1.1 POINT INCREASE IN THE 2005

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO COMPARED WITH 2004 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF

REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS, STATE ASSESSMENTS, INCREASED COMMISSION EXPENSES IN THE

PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT AND INVESTMENTS MADE FOR PROCESS RE-ENGINEERING AND

TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY IN THE PERSONAL

INSURANCE SEGMENT. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSE EFFICIENCIES

REALIZED SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

IN MARCH 2005, THE

COMPANY AND NUVEEN INVESTMENTS JOINTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMPANY WOULD

IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO DIVEST ITS 78% EQUITY INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS,

WHICH CONSTITUTED THE COMPANYS ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENT AND WAS ACQUIRED AS

PART OF THE MERGER ON APRIL 1, 2004. THE DIVESTITURE WAS COMPLETED THROUGH

A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2005, RESULTING IN

NET PRETAX CASH PROCEEDS OF $2.40 BILLION.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET

OPERATING LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF $663 MILLION IN 2005, CONSISTING

PRIMARILY OF $710 MILLION OF TAX EXPENSE DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TAX

BASIS AND THE

80

GAAP

CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE COMPANYS SHARE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET INCOME PRIOR TO

DIVESTITURE. THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF $345 MILLION

($224 MILLION AFTER-TAX) IN 2005. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF $88

MILLION IN 2004 REPRESENTED THE COMPANYS SHARE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET

INCOME FOR THE YEAR.

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME OF $2.62

BILLION WAS $1.58 BILLION HIGHER THAN OPERATING INCOME OF $1.04 BILLION IN

2005, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES, NET FAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, THE CONTINUATION OF FAVORABLE CURRENT YEAR LOSS

TRENDS AND A STRONG INCREASE IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME. THE BUSINESS INSURANCE

SEGMENT INCURRED NO CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2006, WHEREAS IN 2005, THE COST OF

CATASTROPHES TOTALED $1.41 BILLION (INCLUDING REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS OF $67

MILLION), RESULTING FROM HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA AND WILMA. NET FAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $21 MILLION IN 2006, COMPARED WITH NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $757 MILLION IN 2005 THAT WAS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN ASBESTOS RESERVES. THESE FACTORS WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND A

DECLINE IN FEE INCOME IN 2006.

OPERATING INCOME OF $1.04

BILLION IN 2005 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN OPERATING INCOME OF $460 MILLION

IN 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT, THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER AND A STRONG INCREASE IN NET INVESTMENT

INCOME. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

COST OF CATASTROPHES IN 2005. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT TOTALED

$757 MILLION IN 2005, COMPARED WITH $2.03 BILLION IN 2004. THE 2005 TOTAL WAS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A CHARGE TO INCREASE ASBESTOS RESERVES, WHEREAS THE 2004

TOTAL INCLUDED $1.22 BILLION OF CHARGES TO INCREASE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES, AND THE $500 MILLION CHARGE TO INCREASE CONSTRUCTION RESERVES

ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE CONSOLIDATED

OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN. THE COST OF CATASTROPHES TOTALED $1.41 BILLION IN

2005, COMPARED WITH $532 MILLION IN 2004. CATASTROPHES IN BOTH YEARS WERE THE

RESULT OF THE HURRICANES DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW SECTION

HEREIN.

EARNED PREMIUMS

EARNED PREMIUMS OF $10.88

BILLION IN 2006 DECREASED BY $240 MILLION, OR 2%, COMPARED WITH 2005, AS

PREMIUM INCREASES IN THE MAJORITY OF THE SEGMENTS ONGOING OPERATIONS WERE MORE

THAN OFFSET BY THE CONTINUING DECLINE IN OTHER RUNOFF OPERATIONS EARNED

PREMIUMS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE SALE OF THE PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK

OPERATION IN NOVEMBER 2005. THE PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK OPERATION

81

ACCOUNTED

FOR $111 MILLION OF EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2005. EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2005 WERE

REDUCED BY $67 MILLION OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS RELATED TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES.

THE $187 MILLION INCREASE

IN EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF

THE MERGER, WHICH WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN RUNOFF

OPERATIONS, WHERE BUSINESS WAS INTENTIONALLY BEING NON-RENEWED, AND A DECLINE

IN CERTAIN ONGOING OPERATIONS DUE TO A LOWER LEVEL OF WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN

THE LAST HALF OF 2004 AND FIRST HALF OF 2005. IN ADDITION, CATASTROPHE-RELATED

REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS REDUCED NET EARNED PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2005 BY $67

MILLION.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

REFER TO THE NET

INVESTMENT INCOME SECTION OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DISCUSSION HEREIN FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE

IN THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2006 AND 2005.

FEE INCOME

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS IS THE

PRIMARY SOURCE OF FEE INCOME DUE TO ITS SERVICE BUSINESSES, WHICH INCLUDE CLAIM

AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES TO LARGE COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE TO SELF-INSURE A

PORTION OF THEIR INSURANCE RISKS, AND CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO

WORKERS COMPENSATION RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS. THE $72 MILLION DECLINE IN FEE

INCOME IN 2006 RESULTED FROM LOWER SERVICED CLAIM VOLUME IN WORKERS

COMPENSATION RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS, THE IMPACT ON FEE INCOME FROM LOWER LOSS

COSTS DUE TO CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION REFORMS AND LOWER NEW BUSINESS

VOLUME DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION. IN 2005, THE $43 MILLION DECLINE IN FEE

INCOME COMPARED WITH 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION, INCLUDING

THE LOSS OF SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2004 AND EARLY 2005.

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES IN 2006 TOTALED $6.85 BILLION, DOWN $2.51 BILLION FROM THE 2005 TOTAL

OF $9.36 BILLION. THE 2005 TOTAL INCLUDED CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $1.32 BILLION,

NEARLY ALL OF WHICH RESULTED FROM HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA AND WILMA, WHEREAS

THE 2006 TOTAL INCLUDED NO CATASTROPHE LOSSES.

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $21 MILLION IN 2006. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 WAS $757 MILLION. THE 2006 NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN THE COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL,

GENERAL LIABILITY, PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LINES OF BUSINESS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, AS WELL

AS RESERVE STRENGTHENING FOR ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS IN RUNOFF. THE

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND LIABILITY LINES OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN

ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING IMPROVING LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK

CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROPERTY LINE OF BUSINESS PRIMARILY REFLECTED LESS DEMAND

SURGE INFLATION THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED FOR 2005 ACCIDENT YEAR

NON-CATASTROPHE AND CATASTROPHE LOSSES. DEMAND SURGE REFERS TO SIGNIFICANT

SHORT-TERM INCREASES IN BUILDING MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS DUE TO A SHARP

INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR THOSE MATERIALS AND SERVICES. THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

LINE OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, CLAIM HANDLING

INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF INSURANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN

AUTO SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. THE RESERVE STRENGTHENING IN ASSUMED REINSURANCE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN PROJECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT DRIVEN BY AN

UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN THE CLAIM SETTLEMENT PATTERNS OF THE UNDERLYING

CASUALTY EXPOSURES. IN 2005, NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS

DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE TO ASBESTOS RESERVES OF $830 MILLION AND RESERVE

STRENGTHENING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASSUMED REINSURANCE, WHICH IS IN RUNOFF. THOSE

INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT

FROM LOWER FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY FOR BOTH CASUALTY AND PROPERTY-RELATED LINES

OF BUSINESS. DRIVERS OF THE REDUCTION IN BOTH FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY WERE

INCREASINGLY FAVORABLE LEGAL AND

JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, COUPLED WITH BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS FROM CHANGES

IN POLICY PROVISIONS AS WELL AS UNDERWRITING AND PRICING CRITERIA. COMPANY

INITIATIVES

82

RELATING TO CLAIMS HANDLING, WHICH AFFECTED CLAIMS

STAFFING AND WORKFLOWS, ALSO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE

CONTRIBUTED TO THE EMERGENCE OF FAVORABLE SEVERITY EXPERIENCE IN 2005.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2005 OF $9.36 BILLION DECLINED FROM THE 2004 TOTAL OF

$9.84 BILLION. INCLUDED IN THOSE TOTALS WERE $1.32 BILLION AND $532 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES (NET OF REINSURANCE). NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $757 MILLION IN 2005, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $2.03 BILLION IN 2004, WHICH

INCLUDED A $928 MILLION CHARGE TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES, A $290 MILLION

CHARGE TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES AND THE $500 MILLION CHARGE TO

INCREASE CONSTRUCTION RESERVES ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

OVERVIEW SECTION HEREIN. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2004 WAS A $174 MILLION ADDITION TO THE RESERVE FOR

UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, $150 MILLION RECORDED IN TPCS

CONSTRUCTION OPERATION PRIOR TO THE MERGER, $74 MILLION FROM THE COMMUTATION OF

AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER AND OTHER NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN THE COMPANYS GULF OPERATIONS. RESULTS

IN 2004 ALSO REFLECTED INCREASED CURRENT YEAR LOSS RATIOS ON PORTIONS OF THE

CONSTRUCTION BOOK OF BUSINESS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS

WAS FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN SEVERAL CORE BUSINESS INSURANCE

OPERATIONS, WHICH RESULTED FROM REDUCTIONS IN THE FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE

RELATED LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMPROVED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING STRATEGIES IN

PRIOR YEARS, THE RESULTS OF WHICH EMERGED IN 2004.

APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE

$155 MILLION 2006 PRE-TAX INCREASE TO ASBESTOS RESERVES WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE

IN THE PROJECTED DEFENSE COSTS FOR TEN POLICYHOLDERS. ADDITIONALLY, $15 MILLION

OF THE PRETAX RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DELAY IN THE APPROVAL

AND EXPECTED PAYMENT OF THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SETTLEMENT WITH PPG

INDUSTRIES, INC. AS PART OF THE PITTSBURGH CORNING BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION

PLAN. THE REMAINDER OF THE RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED

LITIGATION ACTIVITY AGAINST SMALLER, PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. IN 2005, THE ASBESTOS

CHARGE RESULTED, IN PART, FROM HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE COSTS DUE TO

INCREASED TRIAL ACTIVITY FOR SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED PLAINTIFFS AND PROLONGED

LITIGATION BEFORE CASES ARE SETTLED OR DISMISSED. THE 2005 CHARGE ALSO

CONSIDERED THE JANUARY 2006 COURT DECISION VOIDING, ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS,

THE PREVIOUSLY RENDERED FAVORABLE ARBITRATION DECISION IN THE ONGOING ACANDS

LITIGATION. THE ASBESTOS CHARGE RECORDED IN 2004 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN

INCREASE IN LITIGATION COSTS AND ACTIVITY SURROUNDING PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. THE

$120 MILLION ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE ADDITION IN 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS. IN 2005, THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE

CHARGE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO DECLARATORY JUDGMENT COSTS, WHEREAS THE SIGNIFICANT

2004 CHARGE WAS RELATED TO REVISED ESTIMATES OF COSTS RELATED TO SETTLEMENT

INITIATIVES. SEE THE ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

AND LITIGATION SECTIONS HEREIN FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE RESERVES.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES IN 2006 TOTALED $2.10 BILLION, 3% HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE TOTAL OF

$2.04 BILLION IN 2005. THE INCREASE IN 2006 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE SEGMENTS

EXPENDITURES TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, THE SEGMENTS

SHARE OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS NATIONAL ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN AND

LEGAL EXPENSES RELATED TO INVESTIGATIONS OF VARIOUS BUSINESS PRACTICES BY

CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2005 WERE

4% HIGHER THAN THE 2004 TOTAL OF $1.95 BILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE

IMPACT OF THE MERGER. THE 2004 TOTAL INCLUDED MERGER-RELATED CHARGES AND AN

INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS.

GAAP COMBINED RATIO

THE LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2006 OF 60.3% IMPROVED BY 21.2 POINTS COMPARED WITH

THE 2005 RATIO OF 81.5%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 (VERSUS NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005). CATASTROPHE LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR 12.3

POINTS OF THE 2005 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 PROVIDED A 0.2 POINT BENEFIT TO THE LOSS AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO, WHEREAS NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 ACCOUNTED FOR 6.8 POINTS OF THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RATIO. THE 2006 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO EXCLUDING

CATASTROPHE

83

LOSSES

AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IMPROVED OVER THE 2005 RATIO ON THE SAME

BASIS, REFLECTING IMPROVEMENT IN FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY TRENDS IN SEVERAL LINES

OF BUSINESS.

THE LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2005 INCLUDED A 12.3 POINT IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHE

LOSSES, COMPARED WITH A 4.9 POINT IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2004. NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTED FOR 6.8 POINTS AND 18.6

POINTS, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE 2005 AND 2004 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RATIOS. EXCLUDING THESE FACTORS FROM BOTH YEARS, THE 2005 LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IMPROVED OVER THE COMPARABLE 2004 RATIO, REFLECTING

THE IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE COMPARED WITH 2004.

THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE

RATIO FOR 2006 WAS 1.7 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2005 RATIO, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

THE INCREASES IN EXPENSES DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND THE IMPACT OF DECLINES IN FEE

INCOME. A PORTION OF FEE INCOME IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF EXPENSES FOR

PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE EXPENSE RATIO. CATASTROPHE-RELATED REINSTATEMENT

PREMIUMS OF $67 MILLION AND CATASTROPHE-RELATED STATE ASSESSMENTS OF $18

MILLION ADDED 0.3 POINTS TO THE 2005 EXPENSE RATIO.

THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE

RATIO IN 2005 WAS 0.8 POINTS HIGHER THAN 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE

INTENTIONAL DECLINE IN RUNOFF OPERATIONS EARNED PREMIUMS, A DECLINE IN CERTAIN

ONGOING OPERATIONS EARNED PREMIUMS DUE TO A LOWER LEVEL OF WRITTEN PREMIUM

VOLUME IN THE LAST HALF OF 2004 AND FIRST HALF OF 2005, AND THE 0.3 POINT

NEGATIVE IMPACT OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS AND CATASTROPHE-RELATED STATE

ASSESSMENTS REFERRED TO PREVIOUSLY. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

FAVORABLE IMPACT OF MERGER-RELATED EXPENSE SAVINGS THROUGHOUT THE SEGMENT AND

PERSONNEL REDUCTIONS IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE OTHER SECTOR. THE 2004 UNDERWRITING

EXPENSE RATIO INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF MERGER-RELATED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND

AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS.

OPERATIONS, GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2006 WERE DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM 2005. NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2006, HOWEVER, INCREASED SLIGHTLY OVER 2005. THE DISPARITY

BETWEEN GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH RATES IN 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

A CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF REINSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE COMPANYS DISCOVER RE

SUBSIDIARY IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS THAT RESULTED IN A DECLINE IN CEDED PREMIUMS. FOR

PURPOSES OF COMPARISON BETWEEN 2006 AND 2005 NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME, THE

IMPACT OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF CEDED PREMIUMS FOR PROPERTY CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

IN 2006 WAS VIRTUALLY EQUIVALENT TO THE IMPACT OF THE $67 MILLION OF

CATASTROPHE-RELATED REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS IN 2005. NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH

IN BUSINESS INSURANCE CORE OPERATIONS IN 2006 WAS PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN TARGET

RISK UNDERWRITING AND INDUSTRY-FOCUSED UNDERWRITING, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED STRONG

BUSINESS RETENTION RATES, RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES AND HIGHER NEW BUSINESS

VOLUME THROUGHOUT THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESSES COMPRISING THESE MARKETS. THE

DECLINE IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS PRIMARILY REFLECTED A

REDUCTION IN PREMIUMS RELATED TO FAVORABLE LOSS EXPERIENCE ON BUSINESS PRICED

ON A LOSS-SENSITIVE BASIS AND LOWER NEW BUSINESS VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE DECLINE IN CEDED PREMIUMS AT DISCOVER RE DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE

OF REINSURANCE COVERAGE. IN BUSINESS INSURANCE OTHER OPERATIONS, GROSS AND NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS WERE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE COMPARABLE 2005 TOTALS,

REFLECTING THE SALE OF THE PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK OPERATION IN NOVEMBER 2005

AND THE INTENTIONAL NON-RENEWAL OF BUSINESS IN THE RUNOFF OPERATIONS COMPRISING

THIS CATEGORY.

IN 2005, BUSINESS

COMPARABLE 2004 TOTALS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. HOWEVER,

2005 WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN BUSINESS INSURANCE CORE OPERATIONS DECLINED WHEN

COMPARED WITH 2004 ON A PRO FORMA COMBINED BASIS, REFLECTING INCREASED

COMPETITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND THE REPOSITIONING OF THE CONSTRUCTION BOOK

OF BUSINESS. THROUGHOUT BUSINESS INSURANCE CORE OPERATIONS (EXCLUDING

CONSTRUCTION, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF REPOSITIONING THE BOOK OF BUSINESS), BUSINESS

RETENTION LEVELS INCREASED OVER 2004, RENEWAL PRICING WAS FLAT WITH 2004, AND

NEW BUSINESS LEVELS IMPROVED OVER 2004. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 FOR

BUSINESS INSURANCE CORE OPERATIONS WERE REDUCED BY $67 MILLION OF

CATASTROPHE-RELATED REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS. IN BUSINESS INSURANCE OTHER

OPERATIONS, GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS DECLINED 66% AND 59%, RESPECTIVELY,

NON-RENEWAL OF BUSINESS IN THE RUNOFF OPERATIONS COMPRISING THIS CATEGORY.

NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $2.66 BILLION IN 2006 DECLINED 2% FROM 2005, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF A REDUCTION IN PREMIUM VOLUME FROM CERTAIN NATIONAL

SMALL BUSINESS INSURANCE PROGRAMS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE

SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION MARKET. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE BUSINESS

TRANSFERRED, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 2% IN 2006.

BUSINESS RETENTION RATES REMAINED STRONG AND INCREASED OVER 2005, AND FOCUSED

INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND PERSONNEL LED TO IMPROVEMENT IN NEW BUSINESS

VOLUME OVER 2005. RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES FOR THE SELECT ACCOUNTS MARKET IN 2006

WERE CONSISTENT WITH 2005, AS MODEST PRICING PRESSURES IN NON-COASTAL COVERAGES

WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY PRICE INCREASES FOR COASTAL COVERAGES. IN 2005, NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS GREW 7% OVER 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE

MERGER. HOWEVER, 2005 WRITTEN PREMIUMS DECLINED FROM 2004 ON A PRO FORMA

COMBINED BASIS. BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS IN 2005 INCREASED OVER 2004 AND WERE

ALSO AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS. RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES IN 2005 WERE IN THE LOW

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $2.20

BILLION INCREASED BY 6% OVER 2005, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND OIL &

GAS BUSINESS UNITS. FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THESE INDUSTRY SECTORS,

SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BUSINESS RETENTION RATES AND CONTINUED STRONG NEW

BUSINESS VOLUME CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2006 IN THESE

TWO BUSINESS UNITS. THE REMAINING THREE BUSINESS UNITS IN THIS MARKETTECHNOLOGY,

AGRIBUSINESS AND PUBLIC SECTORALL ACHIEVED LESSER DEGREES OF NET WRITTEN

PREMIUM GROWTH OVER 2005. NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME OF $2.08 BILLION IN 2005

IMPACT OF THE MERGER.  ON A PRO FORMA

COMBINED BASIS, CONSTRUCTIONS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 DECLINED FROM 2004,

REFLECTING LOWER BUSINESS VOLUMES RELATED TO THE PROCESS OF ALIGNING THE

UNDERWRITING PROFILE OF THE TWO PREDECESSOR COMPANIES DURING THE LATTER HALF OF

2004 AND THE FIRST HALF OF 2005. OIL & GAS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN

2005 GREW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER,

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $1.63

BILLION IN 2006 INCREASED BY 10% OVER 2005, DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH IN THE

NATIONAL PROPERTY AND INLAND MARINE BUSINESS UNITS. SIGNIFICANT RENEWAL PRICE

INCREASES, PARTICULARLY FOR SOUTHEASTERN U.S. CATASTROPHE-PRONE EXPOSURES, AND

STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION RATES WERE THE PRIMARY FACTORS ACCOUNTING FOR NET

WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH IN THESE TWO BUSINESS UNITS IN 2006. THE OCEAN MARINE

BUSINESS UNIT ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH IN 2006, PRIMARILY

DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF BUSINESS CEDED. IN 2005, NET WRITTEN

PREMIUMS OF $1.48 BILLION WERE 10% HIGHER THAN 2004 NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME

OF $1.35 BILLION, DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. ON A PRO FORMA COMBINED

BASIS, HOWEVER, NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2005 DECLINED FROM 2004,

PRIMARILY DUE TO COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS FOR PROPERTY AND INLAND MARINE

NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2006

PREMIUM GROWTH IN 2006, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HIGHER BUSINESS RETENTION

RATES AND NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN COMMERCIAL TRUCKING, ITS PRIMARY LINE OF

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME OF $609 MILLION IN 2006 INCREASED BY

$218 MILLION, OR 56%, OVER 2005. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY THE ABSENCE OF

IN 2005.

OPERATING INCOME OF $391

MILLION IN 2005 IMPROVED BY $713 MILLION OVER THE OPERATING LOSS OF $322

PRODUCTS, AND LOWER COMMISSION EXPENSES IN SEVERAL LINES OF BUSINESS. OPERATING

RESULTS IN 2005 INCLUDED A COST OF CATASTROPHES OF $191 MILLION, COMPARED WITH

PREMIUMS RELATED TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, PRIMARILY IN THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS

AT LLOYDS. EARNED PREMIUM VOLUME IN INTERNATIONAL AND LLOYDS IN 2006 DECLINED

SLIGHTLY FROM 2005, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE ELIMINATION OF A ONE-MONTH REPORTING

LAG AT LLOYDS IN 2005 THAT RESULTED IN $48 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL EARNED

PREMIUMS BEING INCLUDED IN 2005 RESULTS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE IN

EARNED PREMIUMS IN INTERNATIONAL AND LLOYDS IN 2006 WAS THE SALE OF CERTAIN

RATIO, REFLECTING THE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE

IN 2005.

AND 2005 WAS $359 MILLION AND $360 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE NET FAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS

EXPERIENCE IN THE AUTO BODILY INJURY AND NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED HOMEOWNERS AND

OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS, AND A REDUCTION IN LOSS ESTIMATES FOR THE 2005

HURRICANES. IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS, FOR 2006 AND 2005, THE

IMPROVEMENT WAS PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS FROM CHANGES

IN CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES. THESE CHANGES INCLUDED PRACTICES WHICH HAVE

ALLOWED CASE RESERVES TO BE ESTABLISHED MORE ACCURATELY EARLIER IN THE CLAIM

SETTLEMENT PROCESS, THEREBY CHANGING HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. IN

ADDITION, FOR BOTH YEARS, INDUSTRY AND COMPANY INITIATIVES TO FIGHT FRAUD IN

SEVERAL STATES LED TO A DECREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS AND A CHANGE IN

HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINE OF

BUSINESS, FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 AND 2005 WAS

PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS,

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND

FEWER SMALL-DOLLAR CLAIMS. THESE CHANGES ALSO RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN

HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. IN ADDITION, FOR 2006, NON-CATASTROPHE

RELATED HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LOSS EXPERIENCE WAS FAVORABLE DUE TO CONTINUED

EVIDENCE OF A LESS THAN EXPECTED IMPACT FROM DEMAND SURGE, WHICH REFERS TO

SIGNIFICANT SHORT-TERM INCREASES IN BUILDING MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS DUE TO A

SHARP INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR THOSE MATERIALS AND SERVICES. APPROXIMATELY $100

MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 RESULTED FROM A

REDUCTION IN LOSS ESTIMATES FOR CATASTROPHES INCURRED IN 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO

LOWER THAN EXPECTED ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSE LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE

KATRINA.

IN 2005, CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES INCLUDED

CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $547 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $189 MILLION IN 2004. CATASTROPHE

LOSSES IN BOTH YEARS WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HURRICANES. NET FAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 WAS $360 MILLION, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE,

COMPARED WITH NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $378 MILLION IN

2004. IN 2004, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE HOMEOWNERS

AND OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS WAS DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER

OF CLAIMS, ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING HIGHER POLICY

DEDUCTIBLE LEVELS AND FEWER SMALL-DOLLAR CLAIMS. THESE CHANGES RESULTED IN A

CHANGE IN THE HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER

THAN EXPECTED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY

SOCIETAL TRENDS. IN ADDITION, BOTH

91

INDUSTRY AND INTERNAL

INITIATIVES TO FIGHT FRAUD IN SEVERAL STATES CAUSED A DECREASE IN THE TOTAL

NUMBER OF CLAIMS, AS WELL AS A CHANGE IN THE HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT

PATTERNS.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES TOTALED $804 MILLION IN 2006, AN INCREASE OF $139 MILLION, OR 21%,

OVER THE 2005 TOTAL OF $665 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSES OVER 2005

REFLECTED INCREASED BUSINESS VOLUME, THE SEGMENTS CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO

SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, LEGAL EXPENSES RELATED TO

INVESTIGATIONS OF VARIOUS BUSINESS PRACTICES BY CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES,

AND THE SEGMENTS SHARE OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS NATIONAL

ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN. THE 2005 TOTAL INCLUDED $25 MILLION OF

CATASTROPHE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. IN 2005, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

WERE $129 MILLION HIGHER THAN THE 2004 TOTAL OF $536 MILLION, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING BUSINESS GROWTH, INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND THE

CATASTROPHE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS.

GAAP COMBINED RATIO

THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 54.8% IN

2006 WAS 7.4 POINTS LOWER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2005 RATIO OF 62.2%. THE 2006

RATIO INCLUDED A 1.6 POINT IMPACT OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND A 5.5 POINT BENEFIT

FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE 2005 LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO INCLUDED A 9.3 POINT IMPACT OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND

A 6.0 POINT BENEFIT FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. EXCLUDING

THOSE FACTORS FROM BOTH YEARS, THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN

2006 WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2005 RATIO, REFLECTING CONTINUED

FAVORABLE TRENDS IN CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE. THE LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2004 INCLUDED A 3.4 POINT IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHE

LOSSES AND A 6.8 POINT BENEFIT FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS IN BOTH 2005 AND 2004, THE

2005 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IMPROVED OVER THE 2004 RATIO,

REFLECTING BETTER CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE.

THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 28.3% IN 2006 WAS

1.4 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2005 EXPENSE RATIO OF 26.9%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

THE IMPACT OF THE INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DESCRIBED

ABOVE, AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN COMMISSION EXPENSES. IN 2005, REINSTATEMENT

PREMIUMS RELATED TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES REDUCED EARNED PREMIUM VOLUME BY $21

MILLION, AND CATASTROPHE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS FROM VARIOUS INSURANCE POOLS INCREASED

TAXES, LICENSES AND FEES BY $25 MILLION.  THESE FACTORS COMBINED TO RESULT IN A 0.5

POINT UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENTS 2005 UNDERWRITING

EXPENSE RATIO.

THE 2.0 POINT INCREASE IN

THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 REFLECTED AN INCREASE

IN COMMISSION EXPENSES, OTHER INSURANCE EXPENSES, AND TAXES, LICENSES AND FEES,

AND THE 0.5 POINT IMPACT OF REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS AND CATASTROPHE-RELATED

ASSESSMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE INCREASE IN COMMISSIONS REFLECTED A CHANGING

PRODUCT MIX AND HIGHER AGENT PROFIT SHARING EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN OTHER

INSURANCE EXPENSES REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF PROCESS RE-ENGINEERING INVESTMENTS

AND INVESTMENTS IN PERSONNEL, TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT BUSINESS

GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

REFLECTED INCREASED COSTS FOR PROPERTY CATASTROPHE COVERAGE (WHICH REDUCES NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS), WHILE NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2005 WERE REDUCED BY $21

MILLION OF CATASTROPHE-RELATED REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS. IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE

OF BUSINESS, NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH OF 6% IN 2006 OVER 2005 PRIMARILY

REFLECTED A STRONG INCREASE IN NEW BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF

TRANSITIONING TO SIX-MONTH POLICY TERMS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR FOR THE

COMPANYS MULTIVARIATE PRICING PRODUCT THAT RESULTED IN A LOWER AMOUNT OF

REPORTED NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2006. BUSINESS RETENTION RATES IN THE

AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS REMAINED STRONG AND CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEAR

RATES. RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES IN 2006 REMAINED POSITIVE BUT WERE SLIGHTLY BELOW

THOSE IN 2005. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN 2006 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN IN

2005. THE COMPANYS MULTIVARIATE PRICING PRODUCT IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF

BUSINESS HAD BEEN INTRODUCED IN 37 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BY THE

END OF 2006.

IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND

OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2006 GREW 10% OVER 2005. BUSINESS

RETENTION RATES AND NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN THIS LINE OF BUSINESS REMAINED

STRONG AND INCREASED OVER 2005. RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES IN 2006 REMAINED POSITIVE

BUT DECLINED FROM 2005. NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN THIS LINE OF BUSINESS IN

2006 ALSO BENEFITED FROM CROSS-SELLING INITIATIVES INVOLVING THE COMPANYS

AUTOMOBILE MULTIVARIATE PRICING PRODUCT.

GROSS AND NET WRITTEN

PREMIUMS IN 2005 INCREASED 6% AND 5%, RESPECTIVELY, OVER 2004. GROWTH IN 2005

WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER PRODUCT LINE, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED

RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES AND NEW BUSINESS VOLUME. BUSINESS RETENTION RATES IN

BOTH THE AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS REMAINED STRONG,

AND WERE CONSISTENT WITH 2004. IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE, RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES

IN 2005 REMAINED POSITIVE, BUT DECLINED WHEN COMPARED WITH 2004. HOWEVER, NEW

BUSINESS VOLUME IN 2005 IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE INCREASED OVER 2004, PRIMARILY

DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPANYS NEW MULTIVARIATE PRICING PRODUCT IN

SELECTED STATES.

THE PERSONAL INSURANCE

SEGMENT HAD APPROXIMATELY 7.1 MILLION AND 6.6 MILLION POLICIES IN FORCE AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS, POLICIES IN

FORCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 INCREASED 10% OVER THE SAME DATE IN 2005. POLICIES

IN FORCE IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

GREW BY 8% OVER THE SAME DATE IN 2005.

THE $21 MILLION DECLINE IN

NET LOSS FOR INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO A $27 MILLION AFTER-TAX GAIN REALIZED ON THE REDEMPTION OF THE

COMPANYS $593 MILLION, 7.6% SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES. RESULTS IN 2006 ALSO

REFLECTED THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS PRIOR YEAR FEDERAL AND STATE TAX

MATTERS AND THE ABSENCE OF EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMORTIZATION OF

DISCOUNT ON FORWARD CONTRACTS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS DIVESTITURE OF NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS THAT IMPACTED THE 2005 LOSS. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2006 DUE TO THE ISSUANCE IN NOVEMBER 2005

OF $400 MILLION, 5.50% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 1, 2015, AND THE ISSUANCE

IN JUNE 2006 OF $400 MILLION, 6.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 20, 2016

AND $400 MILLION, 6.75% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 20, 2036. THE INCREASE IN

NET LOSS FOR INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER IN 2005 OVER 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEBT ASSUMED IN THE MERGER AND A REDUCTION IN

NET INVESTMENT INCOME, WHICH WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF NON-RECURRING

MERGER-RELATED CHARGES AND A REDUCTION IN NON-INTEREST RELATED OTHER

EXPENSES IN 2005.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS THAT HAVE

ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE

INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A

DECREASE IN ASBESTOS CLAIMS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO

RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM THE COMPANYS

POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY),

INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANYS POLICYHOLDERS BY INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT

APPEAR TO BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE. FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM

FILINGS INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS,

THE FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON NEW AND PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS AND

ENTITIES SEEKING BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS A RESULT OF ASBESTOS-RELATED

LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLAIMS,

BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES

BY INITIALLY DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY

ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. BANKRUPTCY

PROCEEDINGS HAVE ALSO CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE

POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT THAT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. RECENTLY,

IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT

CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL

SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE

MANIFESTATION ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE

DOCKET. THIS TREND OF PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF

INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON NEW AND PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS,

CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE PAYMENTS EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE EXPERIENCE IS

IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER

INSURANCE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR

BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE

LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR

BANKRUPTCY, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, ACANDS, INC., WHO IN SOME INSTANCES

HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT

SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. (SEE PART IITEM 3, LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS). IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH

INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER

THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN

POLICYHOLDERS FAVOR AND OTHER COMPANY DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, THE COMPANYS

COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED

AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF

ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS.

94

ACCORDINGLY, ALTHOUGH THE

COMPANY HAS SEEN A MODERATION IN THE OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

MANY COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY

RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE

EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF SETTLEMENT

NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE

RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN

SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. THERE ALSO MAY BE

INSTANCES WHERE A COURT MAY NOT APPROVE A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, WHICH MAY RESULT

IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FOR THE

COMPANY. AS IN THE PAST, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT

OPPORTUNITIES.

IN ADDITION, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY

AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, CHALLENGING INSURERS CONDUCT IN

RESPECT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS, AND, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, CLAIMS BY INDIVIDUALS

SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY, IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN

THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THESE CLAIMS AND HAS RECEIVED

FAVORABLE RULINGS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, TRAVELERS PROPERTY

CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) HAS ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN

APPROVED BY THE COURT IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY TPC IN

THE JOHNS MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY COURT. ON

MARCH 29, 2006, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

OF NEW YORK SUBSTANTIALLY AFFIRMED THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS ORDERS, WHILE

VACATING THAT PORTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS ORDERS WHICH REQUIRED ALL

FUTURE DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST TPC TO FIRST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

BEFORE PROCEEDING IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. FIVE APPEALS FROM THE MARCH 29,

2006 RULING WERE FILED IN THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT, AND

TPC FILED A CROSS-APPEAL. TWO APPELLANTS HAVE VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THEIR

APPEALS AND A MOTION TO DISMISS THE CROSS-APPEAL WAS FILED. ADDITIONALLY, TPC

APPEALED FROM A PROCEDURAL ORDER OF THE DISTRICT COURT RELATING TO THE

TIMELINESS OF THE CROSS-APPEAL. ON JANUARY 17, 2007, THE SECOND CIRCUIT

DISMISSED TPCS CROSS-APPEAL AND DENIED TPCS APPEAL FROM THE PROCEDURAL ORDER.

THE THREE REMAINING PRINCIPAL APPEALS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR DISPOSITION

AND REMAIN PENDING. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW THE APPELLATE COURT WILL RULE ON

THE PENDING APPEALS. IF THE RULINGS OF THE DISTRICT COURT ARE AFFIRMED THROUGH

THE APPELLATE PROCESS, THEN TPC WILL HAVE RESOLVED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

PENDING DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS AGAINST IT. (ALSO, SEE PART IITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS).

BECAUSE EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY

AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY

EACH POLICYHOLDER ANNUALLY ON A POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS. IN THE

COURSE OF THIS REVIEW, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: AVAILABLE

INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE

COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF

EACH POLICYHOLDERS POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND

ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST

SETTLEMENT VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE;

POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS

CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND

APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED

OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF

ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM. FOR THOSE POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH AN ESTIMATE OF THE GROSS

ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR INDEMNITY AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE IS

DETERMINED, THE COMPANY CALCULATES, BY EACH POLICY YEAR, A CEDED REINSURANCE

PROJECTION BASED ON ANY APPLICABLE FACULTATIVE AND TREATY REINSURANCE, PAST

CEDED EXPERIENCE AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS

ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES. THE COMPANYS EVALUATIONS HAVE

NOT RESULTED IN ANY DATA FROM WHICH A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR

INDEMNITY PAYMENT MAY BE DETERMINED.

THE COMPANY ALSO COMPARES ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET

LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE, YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY

EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE

PAID

95

ACTIVITY. NET ASBESTOS

LOSSES AND EXPENSES PAID IN 2006 WERE $469 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $399 MILLION

IN 2005. THE $70 MILLION NET INCREASE IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER

REINSURANCE BILLINGS IN 2006. APPROXIMATELY 50% IN 2006 AND 42% IN 2005 OF

TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES RELATED TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY

ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANYS LIABILITY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, NET ASBESTOS RESERVES TOTALED $4.05 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $4.36 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE COMPANY RECORDED PRE-TAX ASBESTOS RESERVE

ADDITIONS OF $155 MILLION, $830 MILLION AND $928 MILLION IN 2006, 2005 AND

2004, RESPECTIVELY, PURSUANT TO THE COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL

GROUND-UP ASBESTOS EXPOSURE REVIEW, WHICH INCLUDED AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND

CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS,

POLICYHOLDER BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. APPROXIMATELY

HALF OF THE $155 MILLION 2006 PRETAX RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE

IN THE PROJECTED DEFENSE COSTS FOR TEN POLICYHOLDERS. ADDITIONALLY, $15 MILLION

OF THE PRETAX RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DELAY IN THE APPROVAL

AND EXPECTED PAYMENT OF THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SETTLEMENT WITH PPG INDUSTRIES, INC.

AS PART OF THE PITTSBURGH CORNING BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN. THE REMAINDER

OF THE RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED LITIGATION ACTIVITY

AGAINST SMALLER, PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. THE ASBESTOS RESERVE ADDITION IN 2005

RESULTED, IN PART, FROM HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE COSTS DUE TO INCREASED

TRIAL ACTIVITY FOR SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED PLAINTIFFS AND PROLONGED LITIGATION

BEFORE CASES ARE SETTLED OR DISMISSED. THE 2005 RESERVE ADDITION ALSO

CONSIDERED THE JANUARY 2006 COURT DECISION VOIDING, ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS,

THE PREVIOUSLY RENDERED FAVORABLE ARBITRATION DECISION IN THE ONGOING ACANDS

LITIGATION (DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 15). THE ASBESTOS RESERVE ADDITION

RECORDED IN 2004 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION COSTS AND

ACTIVITY SURROUNDING PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS.

AS IN PRIOR YEARS, THE 2006 ANNUAL REVIEW CONSIDERED

ACTIVE POLICYHOLDERS AND LITIGATION CASES, INCLUDING CASES CHALLENGING THE

APPLICABILITY OF AGGREGATE LIMITS ON ASBESTOS CLAIMS. DEVELOPING PAYMENT TRENDS

AMONG POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE AS WELL AS ASSUMED AND

INTERNATIONAL CATEGORIES WERE ALSO ANALYZED. IN 2006 THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD

OFFICE CATEGORIES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS, EXPERIENCED AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN NEW CLAIM FILINGS AS WELL AS

IN GROSS INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE PAYMENTS OVER PRIOR YEARS.

THE COMPANY HAS

RECENTLY OBSERVED THE FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT.

·

THE

EMERGENCE OF MORE STABLE PAYMENT TRENDS FOR A GREATER PROPORTION OF

POLICYHOLDERS;

·

A

DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW CLAIMS RECEIVED;

·

A

DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE ASBESTOS EXPOSURES REFLECTING ADDITIONAL

SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY;

·

A

DECREASE IN THE NUMBER AND VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCIES; AND

·

THE

ABSENCE OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR NEW CLASSES OF DEFENDANTS.

WHILE THERE REMAINS UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE

EXPOSURE FROM ASBESTOS CLAIMS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FACTORS NOTED

ABOVE HAVE LED TO A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ITS

ASBESTOS EXPOSURE.

AS A RESULT OF THESE FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE ASBESTOS

ENVIRONMENT, AND PARTICULAR IN THE EMERGENCE OF MORE STABLE PAYMENT PATTERNS,

BEGINNING IN 2007 THE COMPANY IS NOW ABLE TO SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING ANNUAL

IN-DEPTH PROCESS AND THE EXISTING QUARTERLY ASBESTOS REVIEW PROCESS WITH

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATE QUARTERLY RESERVE ANALYSES. THESE ADDITIONAL ANALYSES

PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH AN INCREASED ABILITY TO DETECT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING

TRENDS, INCLUDING REFLECTING ANY SUCH TRENDS, IN ITS QUARTERLY RESERVE

ESTIMATES.

THE POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS CATEGORY

INCLUDES STRUCTURED AGREEMENTS, COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS AND, WITH

RESPECT TO TPC, WELLINGTON ACCOUNTS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND

HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS (FOR A FULLER DESCRIPTION OF THESE

MATTERS, SEE ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS) (COLLECTIVELY THE DIRECT ACTION

SETTLEMENT). RESERVES ARE BASED ON THE EXPECTED PAYOUT FOR EACH POLICYHOLDER

UNDER THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENT. STRUCTURED AGREEMENTS ARE ARRANGEMENTS UNDER

WHICH POLICYHOLDERS AND/OR PLAINTIFFS AGREE TO FIXED FINANCIAL AMOUNTS TO BE

PAID AT SCHEDULED TIMES. IN MAY 2002, PITTSBURGH PLATE AND GLASS COMPANY

(PPG) AND THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH THREE DOZEN OTHER INSURERS OF PPG, AGREED ON

KEY TERMS TO SETTLE ASBESTOS-RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION UNDER INSURANCE

POLICIES ISSUED TO PPG. THIS SETTLEMENT WAS TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE PLAN OF

REORGANIZATION (THE PLAN) PROPOSED AS PART OF THE PITTSBURGH CORNING (PC)

BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. PURSUANT TO THE PROPOSED PC PLAN, PC ALONG WITH

ENUMERATED OTHER COMPANIES (INCLUDING PPG AND CORNING) WERE TO RECEIVE

PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE FROM

CERTAIN ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. IN PRIOR YEARS THE RESERVES

ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AGREEMENT WERE INCLUDED IN THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT

CATEGORY. ON DECEMBER 21, 2006, THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE

WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA DECLINED TO CONFIRM THE PLAN. CONFIRMATION OF

THE PLAN WAS ONE OF THE MANY CONDITIONS TO THE MAY 2002 RESOLUTION WITH

PPG. VARIOUS PARTIES TO THE PC BANKRUPTCY HAVE FILED MOTIONS FOR

RECONSIDERATION. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW OR WHEN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

WILL RULE ON THESE MOTIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE DECEMBER 21, 2006

RULING, IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE TERMS OF THE MAY 2002 SETTLEMENT WILL

EVER BE FULLY SATISFIED AND THUS THE COMPANY HAS REMOVED THE RESERVES

ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AGREEMENT FROM THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT CATEGORY AND HAS

MADE A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN ITS UNALLOCATED IBNR RESERVE. COVERAGE IN

PLACE ARRANGEMENTS REPRESENT AGREEMENTS WITH MAJOR POLICYHOLDERS ON SPECIFIED

AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE TO BE PROVIDED. PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO

ANNUAL MAXIMUMS AND ARE ONLY MADE WHEN VALID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED. WELLINGTON

ACCOUNTS REFER TO THE 35 DEFENDANTS THAT ARE PARTIES TO A 1985 AGREEMENT

SETTLING CERTAIN DISPUTES CONCERNING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEIR ASBESTOS

CLAIMS. MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF THE WELLINGTON AGREEMENT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF

COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED ON SPECIFIC

AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE AND THE TERMS UNDER WHICH THE COVERAGE CAN BE ACCESSED. AS MORE

FULLY DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, TPC HAS ENTERED INTO THE DIRECT

ACTION SETTLEMENT WHICH IS STILL SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES. IF THOSE

CONTINGENCIES ARE MET, THEN TPC WILL PAY UP TO $502 MILLION, POSSIBLY IN

CALENDAR YEAR 2007. ONE OF THE CONTINGENCIES INCLUDES AFFIRMANCE BY ALL

APPELLATE COURTS OF THE ORDERS ENTERED BY THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT

WITH RESPECT TO THE DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENT. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW

OR WHEN THE APPELLATE COURTS WILL RULE ON THE PENDING APPEALS.

HOME OFFICE, FIELD OFFICE AND OTHER RELATES TO

POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN REACHED, AND ALSO

INCLUDES UNALLOCATED IBNR. POLICYHOLDERS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR HOME OFFICE REVIEW

BASED UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: AGGREGATE ULTIMATE EXPECTED PAYMENTS IN EXCESS

OF A SPECIFIED THRESHOLD (CURRENTLY $100,000), PERCEIVED LEVEL OF EXPOSURE, NUMBER

OF REPORTED CLAIMS, PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATIONS AND POTENTIAL NON-PRODUCT

EXPOSURES, SIZE OF POLICYHOLDER AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES SOLD BY THE POLICYHOLDER. IN ADDITION TO IBNR AMOUNTS CONTAINED IN THE

RESERVES FOR HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE POLICYHOLDERS, THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED A RESERVE FOR FURTHER ADVERSE

97

DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO

EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS, NEW CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS REPORTING CLAIMS FOR THE

FIRST TIME AND POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH THERE IS, OR MAY BE, LITIGATION AND

DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY.

ASSUMED REINSURANCE EXPOSURE PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF

REINSURANCE OF EXCESS COVERAGE, INCLUDING VARIOUS POOL PARTICIPATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL IS EXPOSED TO U.S. ASBESTOS LIABILITIES THROUGH PARTICIPATIONS IN

EXCESS INSURANCE POLICIES, QUOTA SHARE AND EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE POLICIES,

AND RETROCESSION POLICIES, UNDERWRITTEN IN THE LONDON INSURANCE MARKET. DETAILS

OF EXPOSURES UNDER THE REINSURANCE AND RETROCESSION POLICIES ARE IDENTIFIED

ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY IS ADVISED BY THE RETROCEDANT.

REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS

WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR

ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO

VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE,

COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED,

ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION

WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS

FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES

AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION.

LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

98

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN

LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS HAVE INTERPRETED THE

INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND

POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE

ISSUED BY THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE MID-1970S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO

BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT BY THE CLAIMANT

FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE MONETARY

AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY 81% OF THE

NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $337 MILLION) WAS CARRIED IN A

BULK RESERVE AND INCLUDED UNRESOLVED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, INCURRED BUT NOT

REPORTED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF COVERAGE LITIGATION

DISPUTES RELATING TO THESE CLAIMS. THE BULK RESERVE THE COMPANY CARRIES IS

ESTABLISHED AND ADJUSTED BASED UPON THE AGGREGATE VOLUME OF IN-PROCESS

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THOSE CLAIMS.

THE BALANCE, APPROXIMATELY 19% OF THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY

$81 MILLION), CONSISTS OF CASE RESERVES.

THE RESOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES BY THE

COMPANY GENERALLY OCCURS BY SETTLEMENT ON A POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS

AS OPPOSED TO A CLAIM-BY-CLAIM BASIS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY STRIVES TO

EXTINGUISH ANY OBLIGATIONS IT MAY HAVE UNDER ANY POLICY ISSUED TO THE

POLICYHOLDER FOR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND

EXTINGUISH ANY PENDING COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTE WITH THE POLICYHOLDER. THIS

FORM OF SETTLEMENT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A BUY-BACK OF POLICIES FOR

FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE AGREEMENTS HAVE ALSO

EXTINGUISHED ANY INSURANCE OBLIGATION WHICH THE COMPANY MAY HAVE FOR OTHER

CLAIMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ASBESTOS AND OTHER CUMULATIVE INJURY

CLAIMS. THE COMPANY AND ITS POLICYHOLDERS MAY ALSO AGREE TO SETTLEMENTS WHICH

EXTINGUISH ANY FUTURE LIABILITY ARISING FROM KNOWN SPECIFIED SITES OR CLAIMS.

PROVISIONS OF THESE AGREEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE APPROPRIATE INDEMNITIES AND HOLD

HARMLESS PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY. THE COMPANYS GENERAL PURPOSE IN

EXECUTING THESE AGREEMENTS IS TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPOSURE AND ELIMINATE THE RISKS PRESENTED BY COVERAGE LITIGATION WITH THE

POLICYHOLDER AND RELATED COSTS.

IN ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY

EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND THE ANTICIPATED COST

OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS

THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS

AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF SIMILAR EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS

THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF

THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE ALLEGATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AT EACH

SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES

AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT

EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE

OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF

ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER;

THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE,

INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF

NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN ANY

RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION. CONVENTIONAL

ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES.

IN ITS REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS: THE ADEQUACY OF RESERVES FOR PAST SETTLEMENTS; CHANGING JUDICIAL AND

LEGISLATIVE TRENDS; THE POTENTIAL FOR POLICYHOLDERS WITH SMALLER EXPOSURES TO

BE NAMED IN NEW CLEAN-UP ACTIONS FOR BOTH ON- AND OFF-SITE WASTE DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES; THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT; THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL

NEW CLAIMS BEYOND PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS; AND THE POTENTIAL HIGHER COSTS FOR NEW

SETTLEMENTS.

THE DURATION OF THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW

OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE EXTENT OF TIME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE

ESTIMATE, IF ANY, OF THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM TO THE COMPANY VARY

99

SIGNIFICANTLY AND ARE

DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED

TO, THE COOPERATION OF THE POLICYHOLDER IN PROVIDING CLAIM INFORMATION, THE

PACE OF UNDERLYING LITIGATION OR CLAIM PROCESSES, THE PACE OF COVERAGE

LITIGATION BETWEEN THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE

POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY TO NEGOTIATE, IF APPROPRIATE, A RESOLUTION OF ANY

DISPUTE PERTAINING TO THESE CLAIMS. BECAUSE THESE FACTORS VARY FROM

CLAIM-TO-CLAIM AND POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY CANNOT PROVIDE A

MEANINGFUL AVERAGE OF THE DURATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM. HOWEVER, BASED

UPON THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THESE CLAIMS, THE DURATION MAY VARY

FROM MONTHS TO SEVERAL YEARS.

THE COMPANY HAS CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN

THE NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THESE

POLICYHOLDERS GENERALLY PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE

LOWER TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE UTILIZING RISK-BASED

ANALYSIS AND MORE EFFICIENT CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS

EXPERIENCED HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS. THESE INCREASES

HAVE BEEN DRIVEN IN PART BY ADVERSE JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN STATES

REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF COVERAGE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. AS A RESULT OF

THESE TRENDS, THE COMPANY INCREASED ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $120 MILLION IN

2006. IN 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $30 MILLION,

PRIMARILY FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT COSTS. IN 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

PRETAX CHARGE OF $290 MILLION DUE TO REVISED ESTIMATES OF COSTS RELATED TO

SETTLEMENT INITIATIVES. THE INCREASES TO ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES IN EACH YEAR

WERE NET OF REINSURANCE.

GROSS PAID LOSSES IN 2006 AND 2005 WERE $189 MILLION

AND $248 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. TPC ENTERED INTO A SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT WITH

ONE POLICYHOLDER IN 2005. TPC EXECUTED AN AGREEMENT WITH THIS POLICYHOLDER

WHICH RESOLVED ALL PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE HAZARDOUS WASTE AND POLLUTION

PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, AND ALL RELATED PAST AND PENDING BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. IN

ADDITION, TPC AND THIS POLICYHOLDER ENTERED INTO A COVERAGE-IN-PLACE AGREEMENT

WHICH ADDRESSED THE HANDLING AND RESOLUTION OF ALL FUTURE HAZARDOUS WASTE AND

POLLUTION BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. UNDER THE COVERAGE-IN-PLACE AGREEMENT, TPC HAS

NO DEFENSE OBLIGATION, AND THERE IS AN OVERALL CAP WITH RESPECT TO ANY

INDEMNITY OBLIGATION THAT MIGHT BE OWED. THE FIRST TWO PAYMENTS RELATED TO THIS

SETTLEMENT WERE MADE DURING 2005 AND THE FINAL PAYMENT WAS MADE IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2006.

UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED

ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED

BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE

UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT

IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE

CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF

PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION

SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER

INCREASE OR DECREASE IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS

ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS

ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE

AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER

INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER

AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

PERTAINING TO THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION OR

UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY

AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER

DEFENDANTS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A RECENT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER AND

VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCIES. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT

CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE

AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN

APPLICABLE LEGISLATION, INCLUDING LEGISLATION RELATED TO ASBESTOS REFORM. IT IS

ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LARGE COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE

RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY

THE

101

CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN

BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND

OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS

CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS RESERVES, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANNUAL GROUND-UP

REVIEW OF ASBESTOS POLICYHOLDERS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE

IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS MOST

RECENT ANNUAL GROUND-UP REVIEW DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006. SEE PART IITEM

3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

BECAUSE OF THE

UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN

EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES

OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL

TO THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO

THE COMPANYS INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 TOTALED $72.27 BILLION, OF WHICH 94% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, 1% IN EQUITY SECURITIES, 1% IN REAL ESTATE AND 4% IN

OTHER INVESTMENTS. BECAUSE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS

TO FUND FUTURE CLAIMS PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT

PHILOSOPHY. THE COMPANYS FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

TOTALED $62.67 BILLION, COMPRISING $62.46 BILLION OF PUBLICLY TRADED FIXED

MATURITIES AND $208 MILLION OF PRIVATE FIXED MATURITIES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE

QUALITY RATINGS OF THE COMPANYS PUBLICLY TRADED FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AND

PRIVATE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WERE AA1 AND A3,

RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT THAT DATE WAS

APPROXIMATELY $1.78 BILLION OF BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES. DURING 2006,

HOLDINGS OF TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES WERE INCREASED TO $35.63 BILLION TO TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF THEIR RELATIVELY HIGH CREDIT QUALITY AND ATTRACTIVE AFTER-TAX

YIELDS. THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO,

INCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WAS 4.0 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 (4.3

EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS), COMPARED WITH 3.9 AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005 (4.3 EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS).

THE COMPANY MAKES INVESTMENTS IN COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE

OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) THAT TYPICALLY HAVE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY, OFFER GOOD

LIQUIDITY, AND ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE AN ADVANTAGE IN YIELD COMPARED TO U.S.

TREASURY SECURITIES. THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO PURCHASE CMO

TRANCHES WHICH OFFER THE MOST FAVORABLE RETURN GIVEN THE RISKS INVOLVED. ONE SIGNIFICANT

RISK EVALUATED IS PREPAYMENT SENSITIVITY. WHILE PREPAYMENT RISK (EITHER

SHORTENING OR LENGTHENING OF DURATION) AND ITS EFFECT ON TOTAL RETURN CANNOT BE

FULLY CONTROLLED, PARTICULARLY WHEN INTEREST RATES MOVE DRAMATICALLY, THE

INVESTMENT PROCESS GENERALLY FAVORS SECURITIES THAT CONTROL THIS RISK WITHIN

EXPECTED INTEREST RATE RANGES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PURCHASE RESIDUAL INTERESTS

IN CMOS.

102

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE COMPANY HELD

CMOS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $3.56 BILLION AND

$3.43 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY (EXCLUDING COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES OF

$1.07 BILLION AND $1.16 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY). APPROXIMATELY 36% AND 43% OF

THE COMPANYS CMO HOLDINGS ARE GUARANTEED BY OR FULLY COLLATERALIZED BY

SECURITIES ISSUED BY GNMA, FNMA OR FHLMC AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HELD $4.36 BILLION AND $4.83 BILLION OF

GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC OR FHA MORTGAGE-BACKED PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. VIRTUALLY

ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE RATED AAA.

THE COMPANYS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE

WAREHOUSES AND OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL LAND AND PROPERTIES THAT

ARE DIRECTLY OWNED. THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY COMPRISE VENTURE

CAPITAL, THROUGH DIRECT OWNERSHIP AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, PRIVATE EQUITY

LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND TRADING

SECURITIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO MORE VOLATILITY THAN THE COMPANYS FIXED

INCOME INVESTMENTS, BUT HISTORICALLY HAVE PROVIDED A HIGHER RETURN. AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENTS WAS $3.40

BILLION AND $3.17 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) THAT WERE INCLUDED AS A SEPARATE

INCREASE IN NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS ON FIXED MATURITIES WAS PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF DECLINING MARKET INTEREST RATES ON TAX-EXEMPT

SECURITIES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES

ON TAXABLE SECURITIES.

NET PRETAX UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 DECLINED BY $852 MILLION FROM YEAR-END 2004, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN $885

DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES IN 2005. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING

THIS DECREASE WAS A $78 MILLION INCREASE IN PRETAX UNREALIZED GAINS ON THE

VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO, WHICH REFLECTED FAVORABLE RESULTS FROM SEVERAL OF

THE INVESTMENTS COMPRISING THIS CATEGORY, NET OF LOSSES REALIZED THROUGH

THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE IMPAIRMENTS

DESCRIBED ABOVE DID NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT OTHER INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENTS HELD

DURING 2006, 2005 OR 2004. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES CURRENT

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MARKET THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT THE VALUATION OF

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD NO FIXED

MATURITIES OR EQUITY SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE WAS

LESS THAN 80% OF AMORTIZED COST OR COST, RESPECTIVELY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, NON-INVESTMENT GRADE

SECURITIES COMPRISED 2.9% OF THE COMPANYS FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

INCLUDED IN THOSE CATEGORIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WERE SECURITIES IN AN

UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION THAT, IN THE AGGREGATE, HAD AN AMORTIZED COST OF $599

MILLION AND A FAIR VALUE OF $581 MILLION, RESULTING IN A NET PRETAX UNREALIZED

INVESTMENT LOSS OF $18 MILLION. THESE SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION

REPRESENTED LESS THAN 1% OF THE TOTAL AMORTIZED COST AND LESS THAN 1% OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND

ACCOUNTED FOR 4% OF THE TOTAL PRETAX UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSS IN THE FIXED

INCOME PORTFOLIO.

REINSURANCE CEDED, THE COMPANY REMAINS LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL

RISKS REINSURED. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED AFTER REDUCTIONS FOR

KNOWN INSOLVENCIES AND AFTER ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY

ALSO HOLDS COLLATERAL, INCLUDING TRUST AGREEMENTS, ESCROW FUNDS AND LETTERS OF

CREDIT, UNDER CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF REINSURERS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND REVIEWS ITS

REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS PERIODICALLY. REINSURERS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR

OUTLOOK

THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE IS TO ENHANCE ITS

POSITION AS A CONSISTENTLY PROFITABLE MARKET LEADER AND A COST-EFFECTIVE

PROVIDER OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN

SELECTED INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. A VARIETY OF FACTORS CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET AND THE COMPANYS CORE BUSINESS OUTLOOK

FOR 2007, INCLUDING COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE MAJORITY OF MARKETS

SERVED BY THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, LOSS COST TRENDS, ASBESTOS- AND

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED DEVELOPMENTS AND REINSURANCE AND LITIGATION COSTS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS PROPERTY CASUALTY MARKET

CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE COMPETITIVE THROUGHOUT 2007. RELATIVE TO 2006,

WITHIN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS RENEWAL PRICE

CHANGES TO MODERATE AND TERMS, CONDITIONS AND INSURED VALUES TO IMPROVE FOR

EXPOSURES SUSCEPTIBLE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, SUCH AS COASTAL PROPERTY AND OIL-

AND GAS-RELATED EXPOSURES, WHILE RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES FOR NON-CATASTROPHE

RELATED EXPOSURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUBJECT TO MODEST DECLINES. RELATIVE TO

2006, WITHIN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE

SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES TO BE SUBJECT TO MODEST

DECLINES. ALSO RELATIVE TO 2006, WITHIN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES IN THE AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS MARKETS

TO REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE TREND OF INCREASED

SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS EXPERIENCED IN 2005 AND 2004, ALTHOUGH NOT

EVIDENT IN 2006, MAY CONTINUE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. GIVEN THE TREND OF

INCREASED SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS, THE COMPANY HAS REASSESSED ITS

DEFINITION OF AND EXPOSURE TO COASTAL RISKS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT ON ITS

REINSURANCE PROGRAM. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY IS REVIEWING THE PRICING,

EXPOSURES, RETURN THRESHOLDS AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS IT OFFERS IN COASTAL

AREAS. IN PART AS A RESULT OF THE SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS IN 2005 AND

2004, THE COMPANYS COST OF REINSURANCE HAS INCREASED AND THE AMOUNT OF

REINSURANCE COVERAGE PURCHASED HAS BEEN REDUCED. THE COST OF REINSURANCE MAY

CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND AVAILABILITY MAY CONTINUE TO DECLINE. TO THE EXTENT

THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REFLECT THE POTENTIALLY INCREASED COSTS OF

INCREASED SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY OF STORMS OR REINSURANCE IN ITS PRICING, THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. IN PARTICULAR, IN

THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT (AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, IN THE BUSINESS

INSURANCE SEGMENTS SELECT ACCOUNTS MARKET), THE COMPANY EXPECTS A DELAY IN ITS

ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICING TO OFFSET THESE POTENTIALLY INCREASED COSTS SINCE

THE COMPANY CANNOT INCREASE RATES TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY WITHOUT THE APPROVAL

OF THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN STATES. ALSO, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF

THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF STORMS IN RECENT YEARS, RATING AGENCIES HAVE

INCREASED THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPANY.

THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION

OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT

AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. STATES HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME PASSED LEGISLATION

THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE

RISK, SUCH AS LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS FROM WITHDRAWING FROM

CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS. IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE

SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES AND COURT DECISIONS WHICH SEEK TO EXPAND

INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE

POLICIES. THE COMPANYS ABILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO RAISE PRICING, MODIFY

UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCE EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE

TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND/OR

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IT MIGHT

NOT OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING ACCESS TO OTHER

UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES.

WITH RESPECT TO NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED CLAIM

FREQUENCY, THE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED UNPRECEDENTED LOW LEVELS OVER THE LAST

SEVERAL YEARS, A TREND THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO CHANGE MATERIALLY IN

2007. THE COMPANY EXPECTS SEVERITY TREND, THE OTHER COMPONENT OF LOSS TREND, TO

CONTINUE TO REMAIN STABLE FOR NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED CLAIMS. NEVERTHELESS,

WITH CONTINUED PRESSURE ON PRICING, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LOSS RATIOS WILL

INCREASE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IN 2007.

106

CHANGES IN THE GENERAL INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT

AFFECT THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW INVESTMENTS. WHILE A RISING INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, IT

REDUCES THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND THE

AVAILABILITY OF GAINS ON DISPOSITION. A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE

RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW INVESTMENTS BUT INCREASES THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING

INVESTMENTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS ON DISPOSITION.

IN 2006, SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES AND LONG-TERM TAXABLE INTEREST RATES

CONTINUED TO INCREASE. ADDITIONALLY, YIELDS AVAILABLE ON NEW INVESTMENTS OFTEN

EXCEEDED THOSE YIELDS ON INVESTMENTS MATURING IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE

CONTINUATION OF AN UPWARD TREND IN INTEREST RATES IN 2007 WOULD FAVORABLY

IMPACT THE AVERAGE BOOK YIELD OF THE COMPANYS FIXED INCOME HOLDINGS.

IF THE

TERRORISM

RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 AND TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005

(THE PROGRAM)

IS

NOT RENEWED FOR PERIODS AFTER JANUARY 1, 2008, THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM

WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO LOSSES

FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM SUBJECT ONLY TO THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE

POLICIES, INCLUDING POLICIES WRITTEN IN 2007 FOR WHICH THE PERIOD OF COVERAGE

EXTENDS INTO 2008. GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM

LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN THE COMPANYS OWN

REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY THOSE

INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD BE

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND/OR

LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE PERIODS, PARTICULARLY IF THE PROGRAM IS NOT RENEWED.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL

LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL PROPOSALS TO REQUIRE ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS TO DEMONSTRATE

AN ASBESTOS ILLNESS. AT THIS TIME IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD

OR TIMING OF SUCH PROPOSALS BEING ENACTED OR THE EFFECT IF THEY ARE ENACTED.

THE COMPANYS ONGOING ANALYSIS OF ITS ASBESTOS RESERVES DID NOT ASSUME THE

ADOPTION OF ANY ASBESTOS REFORMS. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTLOOK WITH

RESPECT TO ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND LIABILITIES SEE ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY

FRAMEWORK HAS COME UNDER INCREASED FEDERAL SCRUTINY, AND SOME STATE

LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR INCREASE STATE

AUTHORITY TO REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES.

FURTHER, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) AND STATE

INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY REEXAMINE EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS,

SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS,

INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, CONGRESS AND SOME FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM TIME TO TIME

INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT CONDITION OF INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES

TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO IMPOSE FEDERAL OR NATIONAL REGULATION OR TO ALLOW AN

OPTIONAL FEDERAL CHARTER, SIMILAR TO THE OPTION AVAILABLE TO MOST BANKS. WE

CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE EFFECT ANY PROPOSED OR FUTURE LEGISLATION OR

NAIC INITIATIVES MAY HAVE ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS. INSURANCE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT

REQUIREMENTS OR MAY RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS. ALTHOUGH THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DIRECTLY REGULATE THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, CHANGES IN

FEDERAL LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES IN SEVERAL

AREAS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION (E.G. THE REPEAL OF

THE MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT) AND FEDERAL TAXATION, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE

INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING US.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF

POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, SEE ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS IN THIS REPORT.

LIQUIDITY AND

CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF

A COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO MEET THE SHORT- AND

LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE LIQUIDITY

REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS

GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ASSET MATURITIES AND INCOME RECEIVED ON INVESTMENTS.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT

107

WITH THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND ITS $1 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT. CASH

PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CATASTROPHE

CLAIMS ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. SUCH CLAIMS INCREASE LIQUIDITY

REQUIREMENTS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE RECOVERIES MAY BE AFFECTED

BY REINSURER SOLVENCY AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE DISPUTES. ADDITIONALLY, THE VARIABILITY OF

ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIM PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS THE VOLATILITY OF POTENTIAL

JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS ARISING OUT OF LITIGATION, MAY ALSO RESULT IN

INCREASED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT THAT THE COMPANYS FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS WILL BE ADEQUATELY MET

FROM ALL OF THE ABOVE SOURCES.

OPERATING

ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF

CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED $4.77 BILLION, $3.59 BILLION AND $5.07 BILLION IN

2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. CASH FLOWS IN 2006 REFLECTED HIGHER LEVELS

OF COLLECTED PREMIUMS AND NET INVESTMENT INCOME, LOWER CLAIM PAYMENTS ON

CATASTROPHE LOSSES, AS WELL AS LOWER RUNOFF CLAIM PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, CASH

FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2006 BENEFITED FROM SIGNIFICANT 2006 REINSURANCE

RECOVERIES RELATED TO 2005 HURRICANE LOSSES, OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF (PRIMARILY

GULF) AND VARIOUS COMMUTATION AGREEMENTS. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY HIGHER INTEREST PAYMENTS AND AN INCREASE IN TAX PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM

HIGHER PROFITABILITY. CASH FLOWS IN 2005 REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CATASTROPHE LOSSES

INCURRED DURING 2005 AND 2004, AND AN INCREASE IN TAX PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM

HIGHER PROFITABILITY. CASH FLOWS IN 2004 INCLUDED $867 MILLION IN CASH PROCEEDS

RECEIVED PURSUANT TO THE COMMUTATION OF SPECIFIC REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. CASH

FLOWS IN 2004 ALSO BENEFITED FROM PREMIUM RATE AND VOLUME INCREASES. THE

COMPANY UTILIZED $11 MILLION, $2.00 BILLION AND $548 MILLION OF NET OPERATING

LOSS (NOL) CARRYFORWARDS DURING 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, THEREBY

REDUCING CURRENT REGULAR TAX PAYMENTS BY $4 MILLION, $698 MILLION AND $192 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL THREE YEARS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PAYMENTS

FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS BY PAYMENTS FOR CLAIMS

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS RUNOFF OPERATIONS.

INVESTING

ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF

CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED $3.06 BILLION, $5.44 BILLION AND $4.65 BILLION IN

2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES ACCOUNTED FOR THE

MAJORITY OF INVESTMENT PURCHASES IN ALL THREE YEARS.

THE MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE

DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID

INTERMEDIATE-TERM TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, CORPORATE- AND MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS

AND TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE DURATION

OF ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES ARE

EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT OF THE

DURATION OF THE FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO GENERALLY PRODUCES A DURATION

THAT EXCEEDS THE DURATION OF THE COMPANYS NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES. THE

AVERAGE DURATION OF FIXED MATURITIES AND SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WAS 4.0 AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, COMPARED WITH 3.9 AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE COMPANY ALSO INVESTS MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN

EQUITY SECURITIES, VENTURE CAPITAL, REAL ESTATE, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED

PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND TRADING

SECURITIES. THESE INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT

ALSO INVOLVE VARYING DEGREES OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND

LESS LIQUIDITY.

THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE COMPANYS ASSET LIABILITY

MANAGEMENT PROCESS ARE TO SATISFY THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES, MANAGE THE

INTEREST RATE RISK EMBEDDED IN THOSE INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AND MAINTAIN

SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER FLUCTUATIONS IN PROJECTED LIABILITY CASH FLOWS. GENERALLY,

THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND

108

INTEREST PAYMENTS PRODUCED

BY THE COMPANYS FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO ADEQUATELY FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EXACT CASH FLOW MATCH

IN EACH PERIOD, THE SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE BY WHICH THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED

INCOME PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES,

PLUS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF

HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS PROVIDES ASSURANCE OF THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FUND

THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS CREDIT

FACILITIES.

SALE

OF SUBSIDIARY.

THE COMPANYS CASH FLOWS IN 2005

INCLUDED $2.40 BILLION OF PRETAX PROCEEDS (AFTER UNDERWRITING FEES AND

TRANSACTION COSTS) FROM THE DIVESTITURE OF ITS EQUITY INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS.

OF THIS AMOUNT, $405 MILLION WAS RECEIVED DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES, AND THE REMAINDER WAS RECEIVED DIRECTLY BY THE HOLDING COMPANY. OF

THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED DIRECTLY BY THE HOLDING COMPANY, $1.225 BILLION WAS

CONTRIBUTED TO THE CAPITAL OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, WITH THE

REMAINDER AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY

LEVELS WERE INCREASED IN 2005 THROUGH DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM THE COMPANYS

OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, THE RETAINED PROCEEDS FROM THE NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

DIVESTITURE, THE PROCEEDS OF $442 MILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK

(DESCRIBED BELOW) AND THE ISSUANCE OF $400 MILLION OF 5.50% SENIOR NOTES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

TOTAL CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTED ASSETS AND OTHER READILY MARKETABLE SECURITIES

AGGREGATING $1.45 BILLION WERE HELD AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL. THE ASSETS

HELD AT THE HOLDING COMPANY, COMBINED WITH OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS AVAILABLE,

PRIMARILY ADDITIONAL DIVIDENDS FROM OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, ARE CONSIDERED

SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY. THESE LIQUIDITY

REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND DEBT SERVICE.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF

CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED $1.59 BILLION, $473 MILLION AND $516 MILLION IN

2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2006 TOTAL PRIMARILY REFLECTED COMMON

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS

FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. IN 2005, THE TOTAL PRIMARILY REFLECTED

THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT AND DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MATURITY OF EQUITY UNIT

FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT. DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS WERE

THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2004.

DEBT

TRANSACTIONS.

IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY

ISSUED $400 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.25% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES

DUE JUNE 20, 2016 AND $400 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.75%

SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE JUNE 20, 2036. THE NOTES WERE ISSUED AT A

DISCOUNT, RESULTING IN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES OF 6.30% AND 6.86%,

RESPECTIVELY. NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCES (AFTER ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT

AND EXPENSES) TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $786 MILLION, WHICH THE COMPANY APPLIED TO

THE REDEMPTION OF APPROXIMATELY $593 MILLION OF 7.60% SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

(DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW), $150 MILLION OF 6.75% SENIOR NOTES THAT

MATURED ON NOVEMBER 15, 2006 AND $56 MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES THAT

MATURED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY REDEEMED $593

MILLION OF 7.60% SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN 2001 AND DUE OCTOBER 15,

2050. THE DEBENTURES WERE REDEEMABLE BY THE COMPANY ON OR AFTER NOVEMBER 13,

2006. IN NOVEMBER 2001, ST. PAUL CAPITAL TRUST I, A BUSINESS TRUST, ISSUED

$575 MILLION OF PREFERRED SECURITIES, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH, ALONG WITH $18

MILLION IN CAPITAL PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY, WERE USED TO PURCHASE THE

SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY. UPON THE COMPANYS REDEMPTION OF

ITS SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES IN NOVEMBER 2006, ST. PAUL CAPITAL TRUST I IN

TURN USED THE PROCEEDS TO REDEEM ITS PREFERRED SECURITIES. ST. PAUL CAPITAL

TRUST I WAS THEN LIQUIDATED, AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN $18 MILLION

DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL. THE COMPANY RECORDED A $42 MILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE

REDEMPTION OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES, REPRESENTING THE REMAINING

UNAMORTIZED FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT

109

RECORDED AT THE MERGER

DATE. A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE JUNE 2006 DEBT ISSUANCES

DESCRIBED ABOVE WAS USED TO FUND THIS REDEMPTION.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY REPAID $815 MILLION OF ITS

OUTSTANDING DEBT, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING: MATURITIES OF $238

MILLION OF 7.875% SENIOR NOTES, $79 MILLION OF 7.125% SENIOR NOTES, AND $99

MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES BEARING INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 6.44% TO

7.09%; AND A NET REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OF $395 MILLION. IN NOVEMBER 2005,

THE COMPANY ISSUED $400 MILLION OF 5.50% SENIOR NOTES MATURING IN DECEMBER 2015.

THE MAJORITY OF PROCEEDS WAS USED TO FUND THE REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER

BORROWINGS, DESCRIBED ABOVE, WITH THE REMAINDER USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE

PURPOSES.

IN JULY 2002, CONCURRENT WITH THE ISSUANCE OF

17.8 MILLION OF SPC COMMON SHARES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING, SPC ISSUED 8.9 MILLION

EQUITY UNITS, EACH HAVING A STATED AMOUNT OF $50, FOR GROSS CONSIDERATION OF

$442 MILLION. EACH EQUITY UNIT INITIALLY CONSISTED OF A FORWARD PURCHASE

CONTRACT FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK, WHICH MATURED IN AUGUST 2005, AND

AN UNSECURED $50 SENIOR NOTE OF THE COMPANY (MATURING IN 2007). TOTAL ANNUAL

DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE EQUITY UNITS WERE AT THE RATE OF 9.00%, CONSISTING OF

INTEREST ON THE NOTE AT A RATE OF 5.25% AND FEE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FORWARD

CONTRACT OF 3.75%. HOLDERS OF THE EQUITY UNITS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

PARTICIPATE IN A REQUIRED REMARKETING OF THE SENIOR NOTE COMPONENT. THE INITIAL

REMARKETING DATE WAS MAY 11, 2005. ON THAT DATE, THE NOTES WERE

SUCCESSFULLY REMARKETED, AND THE INTEREST RATE ON THE NOTES WAS RESET TO 5.01%,

FROM 5.25%, EFFECTIVE MAY 16, 2005. THE REMARKETED NOTES MATURE ON AUGUST 16,

2007. THE FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACT REQUIRED THE INVESTOR TO PURCHASE, FOR $50,

A VARIABLE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE SETTLEMENT

DATE OF AUGUST 16, 2005. THE NUMBER OF SHARES PURCHASED WAS DETERMINED

BASED ON A FORMULA THAT CONSIDERED THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK ON EACH OF 20 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS ENDING ON THE THIRD TRADING

DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE SETTLEMENT DATE, IN RELATION TO THE $24.20 PER

SHARE PRICE OF COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING. ON THE AUGUST 16,

2005 SETTLEMENT DATE, THE COMPANY ISSUED 15.2 MILLION COMMON SHARES AND

RECEIVED TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $442 MILLION.

IN JANUARY 2007, THE COMPANY REDEEMED ITS 8.47%,

$81 MILLION SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE JANUARY 10, 2027. THE REDEMPTION

WAS FUNDED INTERNALLY. AN ADDITIONAL $1.02 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING

DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WILL MATURE AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING 2007. THE

COMPANY PLANS TO REFINANCE THESE MATURITIES DURING 2007.

SHARE

REPURCHASES.

ON MAY 2, 2006, THE COMPANYS

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $2 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME

TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET, IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 10B-18 UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, PURSUANT TO PRE-SET TRADING PLANS MEETING THE

REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 10B5-1 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

1934, IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A STATED

EXPIRATION DATE. THE TIMING AND ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED IN

THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CORPORATE AND

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, PRICE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 22.8 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER THE

PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $1.12 BILLION. THE AVERAGE COST PER

SHARE REPURCHASED IN 2006 WAS $49.20.

IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 1.2

MILLION, 0.8 MILLION AND 0.4 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, OF COMMON STOCK FROM

EMPLOYEES AS TREASURY STOCK PRIMARILY TO COVER PAYROLL WITHHOLDING TAXES

RELATED TO THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND EXERCISES OF STOCK

OPTIONS.

DIVIDENDS.

DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS TOTALED $702 MILLION,

$628 MILLION AND $642 MILLION IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. ON FEBRUARY 7,

2007, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.26

PER SHARE, PAYABLE MARCH 30, 2007 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON MARCH 9,

2007. THE DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS TO HOLDERS OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

WILL DEPEND UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE

110

COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION, EARNINGS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING

SUBSIDIARIES, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEEMS RELEVANT. DIVIDENDS WOULD BE PAID BY THE COMPANY

ONLY IF DECLARED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OUT OF FUNDS LEGALLY AVAILABLE,

SUBJECT TO ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY.

LINE

OF CREDIT AGREEMENT.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN

$800 MILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM WITH BACK-UP LIQUIDITY CONSISTING OF A

BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN JUNE 2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $1.0

BILLION, FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. PURSUANT TO COVENANTS IN

THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN AN EXCESS OF CONSOLIDATED NET

WORTH OVER GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF NOT LESS THAN $10 BILLION AT

ALL TIMES. THE COMPANY MUST ALSO MAINTAIN A RATIO OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

DEBT TO THE SUM OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT PLUS CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OF NOT

GREATER THAN 0.40 TO 1.00. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS OTHER

CUSTOMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT,

INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO A CHANGE IN CONTROL. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE

COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND ALL OTHER COVENANTS RELATED

TO ITS RESPECTIVE DEBT INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE

CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS AN OPTION TO INCREASE THE CREDIT AVAILABLE

UNDER THE FACILITY, NO MORE THAN ONCE A YEAR, UP TO A MAXIMUM FACILITY AMOUNT

OF $1.5 BILLION, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF A RATINGS REQUIREMENT AND

CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS. THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT

AGREEMENT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006.

SHELF

REGISTRATION.

IN DECEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY

FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT FOR THE POTENTIAL OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES. THE COMPANY MAY

OFFER THESE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE

DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF OFFERING. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY ISSUED $800

MILLION OF SENIOR DEBT (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) UNDER THIS SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT.

SHARE REPURCHASE CAPACITY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD $879

MILLION OF CAPACITY REMAINING UNDER THE ORIGINAL $2 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN 2006. IN JANUARY 2007, THE

COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $3 BILLION INCREASE TO THE PROGRAM,

WHICH THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS TO FULLY UTILIZE BY THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2009, SUBJECT TO THE FACTORS LISTED IN THE SHARE REPURCHASES SECTION ABOVE.

111

CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES, AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, THE COMPANYS FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ESTIMATED

CLAIMS AND CLAIMS RELATED PAYMENTS. THE TABLE EXCLUDES SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS

AND INCLUDES ONLY LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE

SETTLED IN CASH.

THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDES THE AMOUNT AND ESTIMATED

FUTURE TIMING OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED PAYMENTS. THE AMOUNTS DO NOT

REPRESENT THE EXACT LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY

UTILIZING ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE

ESTIMATES INCLUDE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND

ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST BASED ON THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF FACTS

AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS,

ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY, FREQUENCY, LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY

AND OTHER FACTORS. VARIABLES IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS CAN BE AFFECTED

BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING

PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. MANY OF

THESE ITEMS ARE NOT DIRECTLY QUANTIFIABLE, PARTICULARLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF

THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND THE TIME IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER. THE

FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE TABLE BELOW REQUIRED

ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT (INCLUDING SEVERITY CONSIDERATIONS) AND TIMING.

AMOUNT AND TIMING ARE FREQUENTLY ESTIMATED SEPARATELY. AN ESTIMATION OF BOTH

AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED

PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY RELIABLE ONLY IN THE AGGREGATE WITH SOME UNAVOIDABLE

ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

TIMING OF FUTURE PAYMENTS FOR BOTH REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND

RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, GROSS OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS TO

PROTECT ITSELF FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT IT IS PREPARED TO

ACCEPT AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 4 THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING, A

REINSURANCE AGREEMENT MUST INDEMNIFY THE INSURER FROM INSURANCE RISK, I.E., THE

AGREEMENT MUST TRANSFER AMOUNT AND TIMING RISK. SINCE THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF

CASH INFLOWS FROM SUCH REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE

UNDERLYING PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES BY THE INSURER,

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES ARE RECOGNIZED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE

LIABILITIES (THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE)

RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING REINSURED CONTRACTS. THE PRESENCE OF ANY FEATURE

THAT CAN DELAY TIMELY REIMBURSEMENT OF CLAIMS BY A REINSURER RESULTS IN THE

REINSURANCE CONTRACT BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DEPOSIT RATHER THAN REINSURANCE.

(SEE BELOW.) THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE USED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT

AND TIMING OF THE RELATED LIABILITIES.

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS THAT DO NOT TRANSFER BOTH

AMOUNT AND TIMING RISK ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS AND INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE

CONTRACTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

WORKERS COMPENSATION

LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES PROVIDE THIRD PARTY COVERAGE IN WHICH THE COMPANY

TYPICALLY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE ENTIRE LOSS UNDER SUCH POLICIES AND

THEN SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE INSURED FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. CLAIMS

FROM LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENT FOR

CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED EXPENSES BELOW THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, NET OF THE

ESTIMATED RECOVERY OF THE DEDUCTIBLE. THE LIABILITY AND THE RELATED DEDUCTIBLE

RECEIVABLE FOR UNPAID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES AND

114

CONTRACTHOLDER

RECEIVABLES, RESPECTIVELY. MOST DEDUCTIBLES FOR SUCH POLICIES ARE PAID

DIRECTLY FROM THE POLICYHOLDERS ESCROW WHICH IS PERIODICALLY REPLENISHED BY

THE POLICYHOLDER. THE PAYMENT OF THE LOSS AMOUNTS ABOVE THE DEDUCTIBLE ARE

REPORTED WITHIN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN THE ABOVE TABLE.

BECAUSE THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF THE DEDUCTIBLE (CONTRACTHOLDER

RECEIVABLES) OCCURS SHORTLY AFTER THE PAYMENT OF THE DEDUCTIBLE TO A CLAIMANT

(CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES), THESE CASH FLOWS OFFSET EACH OTHER IN THE TABLE.

(9) THE AMOUNTS IN LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS RELATE TO ESTIMATED FUTURE

PAYMENTS OF SECOND-INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM PAYMENT OF

CURRENT CLAIM LIABILITIES. SECOND INJURY FUNDS COVER THE COST OF ANY ADDITIONAL

BENEFITS FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. FOR LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS,

THE COST IS SHARED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND SELF-INSUREDS, FUNDED THROUGH

ASSESSMENTS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SELF-INSUREDS BASED ON LOSSES. AMOUNTS

RELATING TO SECOND-INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

(10) THE AMOUNTS IN REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS

REPRESENT ESTIMATED FUTURE NOMINAL PAYMENTS FOR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS. AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER DEPOSIT AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED

IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE AMOUNTS REPORTED

IN THE TABLE ARE PRESENTED ON A NOMINAL BASIS AND HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. ACCORDINGLY, THE AMOUNTS ABOVE WILL DIFFER

FROM THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET TO THE EXTENT THAT DEPOSIT VALUES IN THE

BALANCE SHEET HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED USING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTING.

(11) THE AMOUNTS IN PAYOUTS FROM CEDED FUNDS WITHHELD REPRESENT

ESTIMATED PAYMENTS FOR LOSSES AND RETURN OF FUNDS HELD RELATED TO CERTAIN REINSURANCE

ARRANGEMENTS WHEREBY THE COMPANY HOLDS A PORTION OF THE PREMIUM DUE TO THE

REINSURER AND IS ALLOWED TO PAY CLAIMS FROM THE AMOUNTS HELD.

THE ABOVE TABLE DOES NOT

INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF LIABILITIES REPORTED FOR STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS FOR

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN

THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY ISSUING THE ANNUITY. THE COMPANY IS NOT

REASONABLY LIKELY TO INCUR FUTURE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS

QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN IN 2006 AND DOES NOT HAVE A BEST ESTIMATE OF

CONTRIBUTIONS EXPECTED TO BE PAID TO THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. ACCORDINGLY,

ANY FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FOREGOING TABLE.

DIVIDEND

AVAILABILITY

THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

DOMICILED IN THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT AND MINNESOTA. THE INSURANCE HOLDING

COMPANY LAWS OF BOTH STATES APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRES

NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE

DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND, THAT TOGETHER WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE

INSURERS CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE

INSURERS NET INCOME FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31,

IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND

BY STATE REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED

UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES.

115

THE INSURANCE HOLDING

COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED

GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE

RESTRICTIVE, LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. A MAXIMUM OF $3.07

BILLION IS AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2007 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS WITHOUT PRIOR

APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT FOR CONNECTICUT-DOMICILED

SUBSIDIARIES AND THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE FOR MINNESOTA-DOMICILED

SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY RECEIVED $1.16 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2006.

ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH LEVELS OF CAPITAL HIGHER

THAN RBC REQUIREMENTS. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE TO USE

THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, ALL

OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF

AMOUNTS REQUIRING ANY COMPANY OR REGULATORY ACTION.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED

INTO CERTAIN CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS FOR GUARANTEES RELATED TO AGENCY LOANS AND

LETTERS OF CREDIT, ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES, THIRD PARTY LOANS RELATED TO

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND VARIOUS INDEMNIFICATIONS RELATED TO THE SALE OF

BUSINESS ENTITIES TO THIRD PARTIES. SEE NOTE 15 TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION,

REVENUES AND EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS

MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES TO BE THOSE APPLIED TO CLAIM AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, INVESTMENT

IMPAIRMENTS AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS.

CLAIM AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS

RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES

AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT

HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN

EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES,

GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN

ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE

ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST UPON FINAL

RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES

OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, THE COMPANY

ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES, REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND

SUBROGATION. THE RESERVES ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY BY A QUALIFIED ACTUARY

EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY.

THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A

HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE

VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES

IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, CHANGES IN INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE RESERVE

ESTIMATION PROCESS, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES,

AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR LOSS AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION

DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM

COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL

116

SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL

CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS

(THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS

ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE

PROCESS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A

REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL

CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. THE COMPANY RIGOROUSLY ATTEMPTS TO CONSIDER

ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME LOSS RESERVES ARE

ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT ENVIRONMENT, FINAL RESOLUTION

OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT ANTICIPATED AT THE

REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN CURRENTLY RESERVEDFAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE.

BECAUSE ESTABLISHMENT OF LOSS RESERVES IS AN

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES, CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED

RESERVES MAY CHANGE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES IN THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED.

THERE ARE ALSO RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF

ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES

RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY BY THE COMPANY AND ITS

INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS

CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE

NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY

FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES;

ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; AND ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF DEMAND

SURGE, INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION, FRAUD, THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION COSTS AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHES

OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT

THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING

PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS

EMERGE.

A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS LOSS RESERVES ARE FOR

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION WHICH TOTALED $4.47

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. WHILE THE ONGOING STUDY OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS

AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES AND OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS CONSIDERS THE

INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER

UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT

IN LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT

THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. SEE THE

PRECEDING DISCUSSION OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING

ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

GENERAL DISCUSSION

THE PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING THE LIABILITIES FOR CLAIM

AND CLAIM EXPENSES BEGINS WITH THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CLAIM DATA. DATA

ON INDIVIDUAL REPORTED CLAIMS, BOTH CURRENT AND HISTORICAL, INCLUDING PAID

AMOUNTS AND INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES, ARE GROUPED BY COMMON

CHARACTERISTICS (COMPONENTS) AND EVALUATED BY ACTUARIES IN THEIR ANALYSES OF

ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES BY PRODUCT LINE. SUCH DATA IS OCCASIONALLY

SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA AS AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE PROCESS

OF ANALYZING RESERVES FOR A COMPONENT IS UNDERTAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS,

GENERALLY QUARTERLY, IN LIGHT OF CONTINUALLY UPDATED INFORMATION.

MULTIPLE ESTIMATION METHODS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE

ANALYSIS OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES. EACH ESTIMATION METHOD HAS ITS OWN SET

OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES AND ITS OWN ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, WITH NO

SINGLE ESTIMATION METHOD BEING BETTER THAN THE OTHERS IN ALL SITUATIONS AND NO

ONE SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES BEING MEANINGFUL FOR ALL PRODUCT LINE

COMPONENTS. THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE PARTICULAR ESTIMATION

METHODS WHEN APPLIED TO A PARTICULAR GROUP OF CLAIMS CAN ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME.

THEREFORE, THE ACTUAL CHOICE OF ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CAN CHANGE WITH EACH

EVALUATION. THE ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CHOSEN ARE THOSE THAT ARE BELIEVED TO

PRODUCE THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATION AT THAT PARTICULAR EVALUATION DATE FOR THE

CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED.

IN MOST CASES, MULTIPLE ESTIMATION METHODS WILL BE

VALID FOR THE PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING

EVALUATED. THIS WILL RESULT IN A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES FOR ANY PARTICULAR

CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY USES SUCH RANGE ANALYSES TO BACK TEST WHETHER

PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES FOR RESERVES AT THE REPORTING SEGMENTS ARE

REASONABLE, GIVEN SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION. REPORTED VALUES FOUND TO BE CLOSER TO

THE ENDPOINTS OF A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER

DETAILED REVIEWS. THESE REVIEWS MAY SUBSTANTIATE THE VALIDITY OF MANAGEMENTS

RECORDED ESTIMATE OR LEAD TO A CHANGE IN THE REPORTED ESTIMATE.

THE EXACT BOUNDARY POINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE MORE

QUALITATIVE THAN QUANTITATIVE IN NATURE, AS NO CLEAR LINE OF DEMARCATION EXISTS

TO DETERMINE WHEN THE SET OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR AN ESTIMATION METHOD

SWITCHES FROM BEING REASONABLE TO UNREASONABLE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ENDPOINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE OR WOULD BE COMPARABLE

ACROSS COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT

ESTIMATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES MAKE THE AGGREGATION OF

INDIVIDUAL RANGES A HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL AND INEXACT PROCESS.

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES ARE EITHER

WRITTEN ON A CLAIMS MADE OR ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. POLICIES WRITTEN ON A

CLAIMS MADE BASIS REQUIRE THAT CLAIMS BE REPORTED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD.

POLICIES THAT ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS REQUIRE THAT THE INSURED

DEMONSTRATE THAT A LOSS OCCURRED IN THE POLICY PERIOD, EVEN IF THE INSURED

REPORTS THE LOSS MANY YEARS LATER.

MOST GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES ARE WRITTEN ON AN

OCCURRENCE BASIS. THESE POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT

OVER TIME AS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE POLICY

ISSUANCE. THE USE OF THE OCCURRENCE FORM ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, AND IT IS ALSO USED TO

PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION GENERAL LIABILITY,

118

INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION

DEFECT. OCCURRENCE BASED FORMS OF INSURANCE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES

REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PROJECTION OF VARIOUS TRENDS, INCLUDING FUTURE INFLATION

AND JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND SOCIETAL LITIGATION DYNAMICS, AMONG OTHERS.

A BASIC PREMISE IN MOST ACTUARIAL ANALYSES IS THAT

PAST PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED IN THE DATA WILL REPEAT THEMSELVES IN THE FUTURE,

ABSENT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW. TO THE

EXTENT A MATERIAL CHANGE AFFECTING THE ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY IS KNOWN, SUCH

CHANGE IS QUANTIFIED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL

COMPANY AND, IF AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXTERNAL DATA. SUCH A

MEASUREMENT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR CLAIM

PORTFOLIO AND THE KNOWN CHANGE BEING EVALUATED. SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGES

TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE

RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS.

INFORMED MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE

RESERVING PROCESS. THIS INCLUDES THE APPLICATION, ON A CONSISTENT BASIS OVER

TIME, OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA

AND ANALYSES. IN ADDITION TO ACTUARIES, EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE RESERVING

PROCESS ALSO INCLUDE UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS

OTHER COMPANY MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER VARYING

INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES. IT IS ALSO

LIKELY THAT DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE, SUCH AS A MERGER, CONSISTENT

APPLICATION OF INFORMED JUDGMENT BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT.

THE VARIABLES DISCUSSED ABOVE IN THIS GENERAL

DISCUSSION HAVE DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON RESERVE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY FOR A GIVEN

PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE CLAIM TAIL, THE REPORTING LAG, THE

IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CLAIM PROCESS FOR A GIVEN

PRODUCT LINE.

PRODUCT LINES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIABLE AS EITHER

LONG TAIL OR SHORT TAIL, BASED ON THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT

TRIGGERING CLAIMS UNDER A POLICY AND THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THOSE CLAIMS.

SHORT TAIL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED QUICKLY, RESULTING IN LESS

ESTIMATION VARIABILITY. THE LONGER THE TIME BEFORE FINAL CLAIM RESOLUTION, THE

GREATER THE EXPOSURE TO ESTIMATION RISKS AND HENCE THE GREATER THE ESTIMATION

UNCERTAINTY.

A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE CLAIM TAIL IS THE REPORTING

LAG. THE REPORTING LAG, WHICH IS THE TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING A CLAIM

AND THE REPORTING OF THE CLAIM TO THE INSURER, MAKES ESTIMATING IBNR INHERENTLY

MORE UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, THE GREATER THE REPORTING LAG THE GREATER THE

PROPORTION OF IBNR CLAIMS TO THE TOTAL CLAIM LIABILITY FOR THE PRODUCT LINE.

WRITING NEW PRODUCTS WITH MATERIAL REPORTING LAGS CAN RESULT IN ADDING SEVERAL

YEARS WORTH OF IBNR CLAIM EXPOSURE BEFORE THE REPORTING LAG EXPOSURE BECOMES

CLEARLY OBSERVABLE, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PRICING AND

RESERVING SUCH PRODUCTS. THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF CLAIM LIABILITIES WITH

LONG REPORTING LAGS ARE ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

FOR SOME LINES, THE IMPACT OF LARGE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS

CAN BE MATERIAL TO THE ANALYSIS. THESE LINES ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS BEING

LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY, WHILE LINES WITHOUT THIS LARGE CLAIM

SENSITIVITY ARE REFERRED TO AS HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY. ESTIMATES OF

CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY LINES CAN BE SENSITIVE TO THE

IMPACT OF A SMALL NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY LARGE CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE ROLE OF

JUDGMENT IS MUCH GREATER FOR THESE RESERVE ESTIMATES. IN CONTRAST, HIGH

FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY LINES TEND TO HAVE MUCH GREATER SPREAD OF ESTIMATION

RISK, SUCH THAT THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS ARE RELATIVELY MINOR AND THE

RANGE OF REASONABLE RESERVE ESTIMATES IS NARROWER AND MORE STABLE.

CLAIM COMPLEXITY CAN ALSO GREATLY AFFECT THE

ESTIMATION PROCESS BY IMPACTING THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE

ESTIMATE, THE POTENTIAL STABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING DATA AND CLAIM PROCESS AND

THE ABILITY TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA. PRODUCT LINES WITH GREATER

CLAIM COMPLEXITY, SUCH AS FOR CERTAIN SURETY AND CONSTRUCTION EXPOSURES, HAVE

INHERENTLY GREATER ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

ACTUARIES HAVE TO EXERCISE A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT

IN THE EVALUATION OF ALL THESE FACTORS IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF RESERVES. THE HUMAN

ELEMENT IN THE APPLICATION OF ACTUARIAL JUDGMENT IS UNAVOIDABLE WHEN

119

FACED WITH MATERIAL

UNCERTAINTY. DIFFERENT ACTUARIES MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED

WITH SUCH UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL

EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF FOCUS. HENCE, THE ESTIMATE SELECTED BY THE VARIOUS

ACTUARIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EACH OTHER.

LASTLY, SIGNIFICANT

STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN ALSO

MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS. THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC

RESULTED IN THE EXPOSURE OF EACH OTHERS ACTUARIES AND CLAIM DEPARTMENTS TO

DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, DATA HISTORIES, ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES, CLAIM SETTLEMENT

EXPERTS, AND MORE ROBUST DATA WHEN VIEWED ON A COMBINED BASIS. THIS IMPACTED

THE RANGE OF ESTIMATES PRODUCED BY THE COMPANYS ACTUARIES, AS THEY REACTED TO

NEW DATA, APPROACHES, AND SOURCES OF EXPERTISE TO DRAW UPON. IT ALSO RESULTED

IN ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY, AS PAST TRENDS (THAT WERE A FUNCTION OF

PAST PRODUCTS, PAST CLAIM HANDLING PROCEDURES, PAST CLAIM DEPARTMENTS, AND PAST

LEGAL AND OTHER EXPERTS) MAY NOT REPEAT THEMSELVES, AS THOSE ITEMS AFFECTING

THE TRENDS CHANGE OR EVOLVE DUE TO THE MERGER. THIS ALSO INCREASED THE

POTENTIAL FOR MATERIAL VARIATION IN ESTIMATES, AS EXPERTS CAN HAVE DIFFERING

VIEWS AS TO THE IMPACT OF THESE FREQUENTLY EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES. EVENTS SUCH AS

MERGERS INCREASE THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY OF RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR A PERIOD OF

TIME, UNTIL STABLE TRENDS REESTABLISH THEMSELVES WITHIN THE NEW ORGANIZATION.

RISK FACTORS

THE MAJOR CAUSES OF MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY (RISK

FACTORS) GENERALLY WILL VARY FOR EACH PRODUCT LINE, AS WELL AS FOR EACH

SEPARATELY ANALYZED COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT LINE. IN A FEW CASES, SUCH RISK

FACTORS ARE EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ESTIMATION METHOD AND IN MOST CASES,

THEY ARE IMPLICIT. FOR EXAMPLE, A METHOD MAY EXPLICITLY ASSUME THAT A CERTAIN

PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS WILL CLOSE EACH YEAR, BUT WILL IMPLICITLY ASSUME THAT THE

LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING CONTRACT LANGUAGE WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED.

ACTUAL RESULTS WILL LIKELY VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE

ASSUMPTIONS, RESULTING IN AN ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM

THAT BEING ESTIMATED CURRENTLY.

SOME RISK FACTORS WILL AFFECT MORE THAN ONE PRODUCT

LINE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CHANGES IN CLAIM DEPARTMENT PRACTICES, CHANGES IN

SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS, COURT ACTIONS,

TIMELINESS OF CLAIM REPORTING, STATE MIX OF CLAIMANTS, AND DEGREE OF CLAIMANT

FRAUD. THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF A RISK FACTOR WILL ALSO VARY BY COMPONENTS

WITHIN A PRODUCT LINE. INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTERACTIONS

WITH OTHER RISK FACTORS WITHIN PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS.

THE EFFECT OF A PARTICULAR RISK FACTOR ON ESTIMATES OF

CLAIM LIABILITIES CANNOT BE ISOLATED IN MOST CASES. FOR EXAMPLE, ESTIMATES OF

POTENTIAL CLAIM SETTLEMENTS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

POTENTIAL COURT RULINGS, BUT THE FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TYPICALLY DOES NOT

DELINEATE HOW MUCH OF THE SETTLED AMOUNT IS DUE TO THIS AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE EVALUATION OF DATA IS ALSO SUBJECT TO DISTORTION

FROM EXTREME EVENTS OR STRUCTURAL SHIFTS, SOMETIMES IN UNANTICIPATED WAYS. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE TIMING OF CLAIMS PAYMENTS IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC REGION WILL BE

IMPACTED IF CLAIM ADJUSTERS ARE TEMPORARILY REASSIGNED FROM THAT REGION TO HELP

SETTLE CATASTROPHE CLAIMS IN ANOTHER REGION.

WHILE SOME CHANGES IN THE CLAIM ENVIRONMENT ARE SUDDEN

IN NATURE (SUCH AS A NEW COURT RULING AFFECTING THE INTERPRETATION OF ALL

CONTRACTS IN THAT JURISDICTION), OTHERS ARE MORE EVOLUTIONARY. EVOLUTIONARY

CHANGES CAN OCCUR WHEN MULTIPLE FACTORS AFFECT FINAL CLAIM VALUES, WITH THE

UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING EACH FACTOR BEING RESOLVED SEPARATELY, IN STEP-WISE

FASHION. THE FINAL IMPACT IS NOT KNOWN UNTIL ALL STEPS HAVE OCCURRED.

SUDDEN CHANGES GENERALLY

CAUSE A ONE-TIME SHIFT IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME

LAG IN RELIABLE QUANTIFICATION OF THEIR IMPACT. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES GENERALLY

CAUSE A SERIES OF SHIFTS IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, AS EACH COMPONENT OF THE

EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE BECOMES EVIDENT AND ESTIMABLE.

120

ACTUARIAL METHODS

FOR ANALYZING AND ESTIMATING CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

THE PRINCIPAL ESTIMATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS UTILIZED

BY THE COMPANYS ACTUARIES ARE THE PAID DEVELOPMENT METHOD, THE CASE INCURRED

DEVELOPMENT METHOD(1), THE BORNHUETTER-FERGUSON (BF) METHOD, AND AVERAGE VALUE

ANALYSIS COMBINED WITH THE REPORTED CLAIM DEVELOPMENT METHOD. THE BF METHOD IS

USUALLY UTILIZED FOR MORE RECENT ACCIDENT PERIODS, WITH A TRANSITION TO OTHER

METHODS AS THE UNDERLYING CLAIM DATA BECOMES MORE VOLUMINOUS AND THEREFORE MORE

CREDIBLE. THESE ARE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS. (SEE

GLOSSARY FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THESE METHODS.)

WHILE THESE ARE THE PRINCIPAL METHODS UTILIZED

THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY, THOSE EVALUATING A PARTICULAR COMPONENT FOR A PRODUCT

LINE HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM THE FULL RANGE OF METHODS DEVELOPED WITHIN THE

CASUALTY ACTUARIAL PROFESSION. THE COMPANYS ACTUARIES ARE ALSO CONTINUALLY

MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE PROFESSION FOR ADVANCES IN EXISTING TECHNIQUES

OR THE CREATION OF NEW TECHNIQUES THAT MIGHT IMPROVE CURRENT AND FUTURE

ESTIMATES.

SOME COMPONENTS OF

PRODUCT LINE RESERVES ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RELATIVELY INFREQUENT LARGE CLAIMS

THAT CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TOTAL ESTIMATE FOR THAT COMPONENT. IN SUCH

CASES, THE COMPANYS ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS GENERALLY ISOLATES AND ANALYZES

SEPARATELY SUCH LARGE CLAIMS. THE RESERVES EXCLUDING SUCH LARGE CLAIMS ARE

GENERALLY ANALYZED USING THE TRADITIONAL METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE RESERVES

ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE CLAIMS ARE THEN ANALYZED UTILIZING VARIOUS METHODS SUCH

AS.

·

ESTIMATING

THE NUMBER OF LARGE CLAIMS AND THEIR AVERAGE VALUES BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS

FROM PRIOR ACCIDENT PERIODS, ADJUSTED FOR THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND

SUPPLEMENTED WITH ACTUAL DATA FOR THE ACCIDENT YEAR ANALYZED TO THE EXTENT

AVAILABLE.

·

UTILIZING

INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES OF THE LARGE CLAIMS, COMBINED WITH

CONTINUAL MONITORING OF THE AGGREGATE ACCURACY OF SUCH CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES.

(THIS MONITORING MAY LEAD TO SUPPLEMENTAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AGGREGATE OF SUCH

CLAIM ESTIMATES.)

·

UTILIZING

HISTORIC LONGER-TERM AVERAGE RATIOS OF LARGE CLAIMS TO SMALL CLAIMS, AND

APPLYING SUCH RATIOS TO THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE SMALL CLAIMS FROM TRADITIONAL

ANALYSIS.

·

GROUND-UP

ANALYSIS OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE (TYPICALLY USED FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL).

THE RESULTS OF SUCH METHODOLOGIES ARE SUBJECTED TO

VARIOUS REASONABILITY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, INCLUDING PAID-TO-INCURRED LOSS

RATIOS, IMPLIED INCURRED-LOSS-TO-EARNED-PREMIUM RATIOS AND NON-ZERO CLAIM

SEVERITY TRENDS. AN ACTUAL VERSUS EXPECTED ANALYSIS IS ALSO PERFORMED COMPARING

ACTUAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT TO EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT BASED ON THE PRIOR REVIEW. ADDITIONAL

ANALYSIS MAY BE PERFORMED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE DIAGNOSTICS, INCLUDING

THE INVESTIGATION OF OTHER ACTUARIAL METHODS.

THE ABOVE IS GENERALLY

UTILIZED TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENTS EXISTING ESTIMATE FOR PRIOR ACCIDENT PERIODS.

FOR THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR, THE AVAILABLE CLAIM DATA

IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE A RELIABLE INDICATION. HENCE, THE INITIAL

ESTIMATE FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR IS GENERALLY BASED ON A LOSS RATIO PROJECTION

METHOD WHICH USES THE EARNED PREMIUM FOR THE CURRENT YEAR MULTIPLIED BY A

PROJECTED LOSS RATIO. THE PROJECTED LOSS RATIO IS DETERMINED THROUGH ANALYSIS

OF PRIOR EXPERIENCE PERIODS USING LOSS TREND, RATE LEVEL DIFFERENCES, MIX OF

BUSINESS CHANGES AND OTHER KNOWN OR OBSERVED FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CURRENT

ACCIDENT YEAR RELATIVE TO PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS. THE EXACT NUMBER OF PRIOR ACCIDENT

YEARS UTILIZED VARIES BY PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT, BASED ON THE VOLUME OF

BUSINESS FOR THAT COMPONENT AND THE RELIABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT YEAR

ESTIMATE.

(1)

THE PAID AND INCURRED

DEVELOPMENT METHODS ARE SOMETIMES ALSO KNOWN AS LINK RATIO METHODS.

121

MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATES

AT LEAST ONCE PER QUARTER, CERTAIN COMPANY MANAGEMENT

MEETS WITH ITS ACTUARIES TO REVIEW THE LATEST CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVE ANALYSES. BASED ON THESE ANALYSES, MANAGEMENT DETERMINES

WHETHER ITS ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CHANGED. IN DOING SO,

IT MUST EVALUATE WHETHER THE NEW DATA PROVIDED REPRESENTS CREDIBLE ACTIONABLE

INFORMATION OR AN ANOMALY THAT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM

LIABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, PAYMENTS MAY HAVE DECREASED IN ONE

GEOGRAPHIC REGION DUE TO FEWER CLAIM ADJUSTERS BEING AVAILABLE TO PROCESS

CLAIMS. THE RESULTING CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS WOULD BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE

WHETHER OR NOT THE CHANGE IN PAYMENT PATTERN REPRESENTS A CHANGE IN ULTIMATE

CLAIM LIABILITY.

SUCH AN ASSESSMENT

REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT. IT IS FREQUENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE

WHETHER A CHANGE IN THE DATA IS AN ANOMALY UNTIL SOMETIME AFTER THE EVENT. EVEN

IF A CHANGE IS DETERMINED TO BE PERMANENT, IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO

RELIABLY DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE UNTIL SOMETIME LATER. THE OVERALL

DETAILED ANALYSES SUPPORTING SUCH AN EFFORT CAN TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS TO PERFORM.

THIS IS DUE TO THE NEED TO EVALUATE THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE TRENDS

OBSERVED, AND MAY INCLUDE THE GATHERING OR ASSEMBLING OF DATA NOT PREVIOUSLY

AVAILABLE. IT MAY ALSO INCLUDE INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE

UNDERLYING PROCESSES. AS A RESULT, THERE CAN BE A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE

EMERGENCE OF A CHANGE AND A DETERMINATION THAT THE CHANGE SHOULD BE REFLECTED

IN THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED CLAIM LIABILITIES. THE FINAL ESTIMATE SELECTED BY

MANAGEMENT IN A REPORTING PERIOD IS BASED ON THESE VARIOUS DETAILED ANALYSES OF

PAST DATA, ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ANY NEW ACTIONABLE INFORMATION.

DISCUSSION OF

PRODUCT LINES

THE FOLLOWING SECTION DETAILS RESERVING CONSIDERATIONS

AND COMMON RISK FACTORS BY PRODUCT LINE. THERE ARE MANY ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS

THAT MAY IMPACT ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS. EACH RISK FACTOR PRESENTED WILL HAVE A

DIFFERENT IMPACT ON REQUIRED RESERVES. ALSO, RISK FACTORS CAN HAVE OFFSETTING

OR COMPOUNDING EFFECTS ON REQUIRED RESERVES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN WORKERS

COMPENSATION, THE USE OF EXPENSIVE MEDICAL PROCEDURES THAT RESULT IN MEDICAL

COST INFLATION MAY ENABLE WORKERS TO RETURN TO WORK FASTER, THEREBY LOWERING

INDEMNITY COSTS. THUS, IN ALMOST ALL CASES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCRETELY

MEASURE THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE RISK FACTOR AND CONSTRUCT A MEANINGFUL

SENSITIVITY EXPECTATION.

IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

INFORMATION ON REASONABLY POSSIBLE RESERVING CHANGES BY PRODUCT LINE, THE

HISTORICAL CHANGES IN YEAR-END LOSS RESERVES OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD ARE

PROVIDED FOR THE U.S. PRODUCT LINES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR BOTH THE

COMPANY AND THE INDUSTRY FOR THE NINE MOST RECENT YEARS, AND IS BASED ON THE

MOST RECENT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FOR THE REPORTED LINE(S) THAT MOST

CLOSELY MATCH THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT LINE BEING DISCUSSED. THESE CHANGES WERE

CALCULATED, NET OF REINSURANCE, FROM STATUTORY ANNUAL STATEMENT DATA FOUND IN

SCHEDULE P OF THOSE STATEMENTS, AND REPRESENT THE REPORTED RESERVE DEVELOPMENT

ON THE BEGINNING-OF-THE-YEAR CLAIM LIABILITIES DIVIDED BY THE BEGINNING CLAIM

LIABILITIES, ALL ACCIDENT YEARS COMBINED, EXCLUDING NON-DEFENSE RELATED CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE. DATA PRESENTED FOR THE COMPANY INCLUDES HISTORY FOR THE

ENTIRE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS GROUP (U.S. COMPANIES ONLY), WHETHER OR NOT THE

INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIARIES WERE ORIGINALLY PART OF SPC OR TPC. THIS TREATMENT IS

REQUIRED BY THE STATUTORY REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS PROMULGATED BY STATE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES FOR SCHEDULE P. COMPARABLE DATA FOR NON-U.S. COMPANIES

IS NOT AVAILABLE.

GENERAL LIABILITY

GENERAL LIABILITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL

LINE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS

FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT

IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION AND SPECIFIC

POLICY PROVISIONS SUCH AS SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS

COMPONENTS UNDERLYING THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. SOME OF THESE HAVE

RELATIVELY MODERATE PAYMENT PATTERNS (WITH MOST OF THE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN

ACCIDENT YEAR

122

CLOSED WITHIN 5 TO 7

YEARS), WHILE OTHERS CAN HAVE EXTREME LAGS IN BOTH REPORTING AND PAYMENT OF

CLAIMS (E.G., A REPORTING LAG OF A DECADE FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT CLAIMS).

WHILE THE MAJORITY OF GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES ARE

WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS, CERTAIN GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES (SUCH AS

THOSE COVERING DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OR PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY) ARE TYPICALLY

INSURED ON A CLAIMS-MADE BASIS.

GENERAL LIABILITY RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED AS

TWO COMPONENTS: PRIMARY AND EXCESS/UMBRELLA, WITH THE PRIMARY COMPONENT

GENERALLY ANALYZED SEPARATELY FOR BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. BODILY

INJURY LIABILITY PAYMENTS REIMBURSE THE CLAIMANT FOR DAMAGES PERTAINING TO

PHYSICAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF THE POLICYHOLDERS LEGAL OBLIGATION ARISING FROM

NON-INTENTIONAL ACTS SUCH AS NEGLIGENCE, SUBJECT TO THE INSURANCE POLICY

PROVISIONS. IN SOME CASES THE DAMAGES CAN INCLUDE FUTURE WAGE LOSS (WHICH IS A

FUNCTION OF FUTURE EARNINGS POWER AND WAGE INFLATION) AND FUTURE MEDICAL

TREATMENT COSTS. PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY PAYMENTS RESULT FROM DAMAGES TO THE

CLAIMANTS PRIVATE PROPERTY ARISING FROM THE POLICYHOLDERS LEGAL OBLIGATION

FOR NON-INTENTIONAL ACTS. IN MOST CASES, PROPERTY DAMAGE LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION

OF COSTS AS OF THE LOSS DATE, OR SOON THEREAFTER. IN ADDITION, SIZABLE OR

UNIQUE EXPOSURES ARE REVIEWED SEPARATELY, SUCH AS ASBESTOS, ENVIRONMENTAL,

OTHER MASS TORTS, CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND LARGE UNIQUE

ACCOUNTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DISTORT THE ANALYSIS. THESE UNIQUE CATEGORIES

OFTEN REQUIRE A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND REQUIRE RESERVE ANALYSES THAT

DO NOT RELY ON TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS.

DEFENSE COSTS ARE ALSO A PART OF THE INSURED COSTS

COVERED BY LIABILITY POLICIES AND CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, SOMETIMES GREATER THAN

THE COST OF THE ACTUAL PAID CLAIMS. FOR SOME PRODUCTS THIS RISK IS MITIGATED BY

POLICY LANGUAGE SUCH THAT THE INSURED PORTION OF DEFENSE COSTS ERODES THE

AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT AVAILABLE TO PAY THE CLAIM. SUCH DEFENSE WITHIN THE

LIMITS POLICIES ARE MOST COMMON FOR CLAIMS MADE PRODUCTS. WHEN DEFENSE COSTS

ARE OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITS, AMOUNTS PAID FOR DEFENSE COSTS DO NOT ERODE THE

POLICY LIMITS.

123

THIS LINE IS TYPICALLY THE LARGEST SOURCE OF RESERVE

ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY IN THE UNITED STATES (EXCLUDING ASSUMED REINSURANCE

CONTRACTS COVERING THE SAME RISK). MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS RESERVE ESTIMATE

UNCERTAINTY INCLUDE THE REPORTING LAG (I.E., THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE

EVENT TRIGGERING COVERAGE AND THE ACTUAL REPORTING OF THE CLAIM), THE NUMBER OF

PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE UNDERLYING TORT ACTION, WHETHER THE EVENT TRIGGERING

COVERAGE IS CONFINED TO ONLY ONE TIME PERIOD OR IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE TIME

PERIODS, THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED (IN THE INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ACTIONS),

WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND INTENDED TO BE COVERED AT

THE TIME THE CONTRACTS WERE WRITTEN (I.E., COVERAGE DISPUTE POTENTIAL), AND THE

POTENTIAL FOR MASS CLAIM ACTIONS. CLAIMS WITH LONGER REPORTING LAGS RESULT IN

GREATER INHERENT RISK. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR ALLEGED CLAIMS WITH A

LATENCY FEATURE, PARTICULARLY WHERE COURTS HAVE RULED THAT COVERAGE IS SPREAD

OVER MULTIPLE POLICY YEARS, HENCE INVOLVING MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS (AND THEIR

INSURERS AND REINSURERS) AND MULTIPLE POLICIES (THEREBY INCREASING THE

POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED AND THE UNDERLYING SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY). CLAIMS

WITH LONG LATENCIES ALSO INCREASE THE POTENTIAL RECOGNITION LAG, I.E., THE LAG

BETWEEN WRITING A TYPE OF POLICY IN A CERTAIN MARKET AND THE RECOGNITION THAT

SUCH POLICIES HAVE POTENTIAL MASS TORT AND/OR LATENT CLAIM EXPOSURE.

THE AMOUNT OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY ALSO VARIES

SIGNIFICANTLY BY COMPONENT FOR THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. THE

COMPONENTS IN THIS PRODUCT LINE WITH THE LONGEST LATENCY, LONGEST REPORTING

LAGS, LARGEST POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED, AND GREATEST CLAIM SETTLEMENT

COMPLEXITY ARE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL. COMPONENTS THAT INCLUDE LATENCY,

REPORTING LAG AND/OR COMPLEXITY ISSUES, BUT TO A MATERIALLY LESSER EXTENT THAN

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE,

AND OTHER MASS TORT ACTIONS. MANY COMPONENTS OF GENERAL LIABILITY ARE NOT

SUBJECT TO MATERIAL LATENCY OR CLAIM COMPLEXITY RISKS AND HENCE HAVE MATERIALLY

LESS UNCERTAINTY THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED COMPONENTS. IN GENERAL, POLICIES

PROVIDING COVERAGE WITH SHORTER REPORTING LAGS, FEWER PARTIES INVOLVED IN

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS, ONLY ONE POLICY POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED PER CLAIM, FEWER

POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOLLARS, REASONABLY FORESEEABLE (AND STABLE) POTENTIAL

HAZARDS/CLAIMS AND NO MASS TORT POTENTIAL RESULT IN MUCH LESS RESERVE ESTIMATE

UNCERTAINTY THAN POLICIES WITHOUT THOSE CHARACTERISTICS.

BESIDES THE TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS MENTIONED IN

THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION, THE COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS REPORT YEAR

DEVELOPMENT METHODS AND S-CURVES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT COMPONENTS OF THIS

PRODUCT LINE. THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT REPORT YEAR DEVELOPMENT ANALYSIS IS

SUPPLEMENTED WITH PROJECTED CLAIM COUNTS AND AVERAGE VALUES FOR IBNR CLAIM

COUNTS. FOR COMPONENTS WITH GREATER LAGS IN CLAIM REPORTING, SUCH AS EXCESS AND

UMBRELLA COMPONENTS OF THIS PRODUCT LINE, THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE BF METHOD

MORE HEAVILY THAN PAID AND CASE INCURRED DEVELOPMENT.

EXAMPLES OF COMMON RISK FACTORS, OR PERCEPTIONS

THEREOF, THAT COULD CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED GENERAL LIABILITY

RESERVES (BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION) INCLUDE.

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT

RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE

RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR GENERAL LIABILITY (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS

AND ENVIRONMENTAL), A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS

DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.6% INCREASE

(DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY, THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE

ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

AMOUNTS, OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -3% TO +14% (AVERAGING +5%)

FOR THE COMPANY AND -4% TO +7% (AVERAGING +1%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE

COMPANYS YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY AND ARE BASED ON OBSERVED

EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. BECAUSE THE HIGH END OF THE COMPANYS RANGE OF

HISTORICAL ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT CAME FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS THAT HAS SINCE BEEN

EXITED, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE INDUSTRYS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES

IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES

FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. GENERAL LIABILITY RESERVES (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL) REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 26% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL LOSS

RESERVES.

THE COMPANYS CHANGE IN

RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL AMOUNTS, WAS +2% FOR 2006, +4% FOR 2005 AND +10% FOR 2004. THE

2006 CHANGE LARGELY RESULTED FROM DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND ERRORS AND

OMISSIONS ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO WORSE THAN EXPECTED LARGE LOSS ACTIVITY AND

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM DETAILED CLAIM REVIEWS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH

ACCIDENT YEARS 2002 AND 2003. THE 2005 CHANGE WAS THE NET RESULT OF NUMEROUS

ADJUSTMENTS FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH NO INDIVIDUAL ITEM BEING A PRIMARY

DRIVER. THE 2004 CHANGE WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT AND

CONSTRUCTION WRAP-UP RESERVING ACTIONS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 76 OF THIS

NARRATIVE.

PROPERTY

PROPERTY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL LINE

WITH A SIMPLER AND FASTER CLAIM REPORTING AND ADJUSTMENT PROCESS THAN LIABILITY

COVERAGES, AND LESS UNCERTAINTY IN THE RESERVE SETTING PROCESS (EXCEPT FOR MORE

COMPLEX BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS). IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A MODERATE

FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY LINE, EXCEPT FOR CATASTROPHES AND COVERAGE

RELATED TO LARGE PROPERTIES. THE CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR

PROPERTY COVERAGE CLAIM RESERVES IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE

INSURER. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A LOW ESTIMATION

RISK, EXCEPT POSSIBLY FOR CATASTROPHES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS.

PROPERTY RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN TWO

COMPONENTS, ONE FOR CATASTROPHIC OR OTHER LARGE SINGLE EVENTS, AND ANOTHER FOR

ALL OTHER EVENTS. EXAMPLES OF COMMON RISK FACTORS, OR PERCEPTIONS THEREOF, THAT

COULD CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED PROPERTY RESERVES (BEYOND THOSE

INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION) INCLUDE.

PROPERTY RISK FACTORS

PHYSICAL CONCENTRATION OF POLICYHOLDERS

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF LOCAL CONTRACTORS

FOR THE MORE SEVERE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, DEMAND SURGE INFLATION, WHICH REFERS

TO SIGNIFICANT SHORT-TERM INCREASES IN BUILDING MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS DUE TO

A SHARP INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR THOSE MATERIALS AND SERVICES

LOCAL BUILDING CODES

AMOUNT OF TIME TO RETURN PROPERTY TO FULL USAGE (FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION

CLAIMS)

COURT INTERPRETATION OF POLICY PROVISIONS (SUCH AS OCCURRENCE DEFINITION, OR

WIND VERSUS FLOODING)

LAGS IN REPORTING CLAIMS (E.G., WINTER DAMAGE TO SUMMER HOMES, HIDDEN DAMAGE

AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE)

COURT OR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

125

PROPERTY BOOK OF BUSINESS RISK FACTORS

POLICY PROVISIONS MIX (E.G., DEDUCTIBLES, POLICY LIMITS,

CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING STANDARDS

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT

RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE

RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR PROPERTY, A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN

INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN

A 1.1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY, THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE

ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -34%

TO +26% (AVERAGING -4%) FOR THE COMPANY AND -14% TO +7% (AVERAGING

0%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANYS YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY

AND ARE BASED ON OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. BECAUSE THE HIGH END OF THE

COMPANYS RANGE OF HISTORICAL ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT CAME FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS

THAT HAS SINCE BEEN EXITED, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE INDUSTRYS RANGE OF

HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN

RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE.

WHILE PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE,

THE ONE YEAR CHANGE CAN BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THE LONGER TAIL PRODUCT LINES. THIS

IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVE RELATES TO THE MOST RECENT

ACCIDENT YEAR, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE MOST UNCERTAINTY FOR ALL PRODUCT LINES. THIS

RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR UNCERTAINTY IS RELEVANT TO PROPERTY DUE TO WEATHER RELATED

EVENTS WHICH TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE LAST HALF OF THE YEAR AND GENERALLY

DONT CLEARLY RESOLVE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

THE COMPANYS CHANGE IN

RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -11% FOR 2006, -34% FOR

2005 AND -18% FOR 2004. THE 2006 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED LESS

DEMAND SURGE INFLATION THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED FOR 2005 ACCIDENT YEAR NON-CATASTROPHE

AND CATASTROPHE LOSSES. THE 2005 AND 2004 CHANGES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO BETTER

THAN EXPECTED RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN POLICY PROVISIONS AS WELL AS UNDERWRITING

AND PRICING CRITERIA. THE RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE ARE ALSO

POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO MATERIAL CHANGES DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN MEASURING

ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR UNPRECEDENTED SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THE EVENTS

OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 AND HURRICANE KATRINA. SUCH MATERIAL CHANGES DID NOT

MATERIALIZE IN 2006, 2005 OR 2004.

COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF

PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND, THEREFORE,

INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE, IT

GENERALLY TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS, WHILE FOR

THE OTHER COVERAGES, GENERALLY FOR THE LIABILITY COVERAGES, IT TAKES A LONGER

PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS.

THE RESERVING RISK FOR THIS LINE IS DOMINATED BY THE LIABILITY

COVERAGE PORTION OF THIS PRODUCT, EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY IN THE EVENT OF

CATASTROPHIC OR LARGE SINGLE LOSSES. THE RESERVING RISK FOR THIS LINE DIFFERS

FROM THAT OF THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE AND THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE

DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CUSTOMER. COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL IS GENERALLY SOLD TO

SMALLER SIZED ACCOUNTS, WHILE THE CUSTOMER PROFILE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY AND

PROPERTY INCLUDE LARGER CUSTOMERS.

SEE PROPERTY RISK FACTORS AND GENERAL LIABILITY

RISK FACTORS, DISCUSSED ABOVE, WITH REGARD TO RESERVING RISK FOR COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL.

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT

RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE

RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL (EXCLUDING

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL), A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS

DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.2% INCREASE

(DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

126

HISTORICALLY, THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE

ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -6%

TO +2% (AVERAGING -3%) FOR THE COMPANY AND -2% TO +6% (AVERAGING

+2%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANYS YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY

AND ARE BASED ON OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS

RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR

CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 8% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THIS LINE COMBINES GENERAL

LIABILITY AND PROPERTY COVERAGES AND IT HAS BEEN IMPACTED IN THE PAST BY MANY

OF THE SAME EVENTS AS THOSE TWO LINES.

THE COMPANYS CHANGE IN

RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -4% FOR 2006, -6% FOR

2005 AND -5% FOR 2004. THE 2006 CHANGE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO BETTER

THAN EXPECTED RESULTS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, INCREASINGLY FAVORABLE LEGAL

AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND

CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE 2005 CHANGE WAS THE RESULT OF INCREASINGLY

FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, COUPLED WITH BETTER THAN EXPECTED

RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN POLICY PROVISIONS AS WELL AS UNDERWRITING AND PRICING

CRITERIA. THE 2004 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED

RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING STRATEGIES.

COMMERCIAL

AUTOMOBILE

THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE IS A MIX OF

PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGES AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG

TAIL COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO

PHYSICAL DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE

PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE

TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. IN GENERAL, CLAIM REPORTING LAGS ARE MINOR, CLAIM

COMPLEXITY IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE, AND THE LINE IS VIEWED AS HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW

TO MODERATE SEVERITY. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A

MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED

IN FOUR COMPONENTS; BODILY INJURY LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY,

COLLISION CLAIMS AND COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS. THESE LAST TWO COMPONENTS HAVE

MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE RISK FACTORS

ARE NOT PRESENTED.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS

MENTIONED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOVE IN ESTIMATING CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR

THIS LINE. THIS IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH DETAILED CUSTOM ANALYSES WHERE NEEDED.

RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, A 1% INCREASE

(DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR

COULD RESULT IN A 1.3% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY, THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE

ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -7%

TO +9% (AVERAGING +1%) FOR THE COMPANY AND -1% TO +9% (AVERAGING +2%) FOR

THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANYS YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY AND ARE

BASED ON OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE

OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES

IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE RESERVES

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THE COMPANYS CHANGE IN

RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -7% FOR 2006, -5% FOR

2005 AND -2% FOR 2004. THE 2006 CHANGE WAS DUE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED

LOSS DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2003 THROUGH 2005, WHICH WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, CLAIM HANDLING

INITIATIVES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN AUTO SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. THE 2005 CHANGE WAS DUE

TO THE EFFECT OF INCREASINGLY FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS AS WELL

AS BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN POLICY PROVISIONS AS WELL AS UNDERWRITING

AND PRICING CRITERIA, ESPECIALLY FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2004. THE 2004 CHANGE WAS

DUE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS FROM UNDERWRITING AND PRICING STRATEGIES,

ESPECIALLY FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2003.

WORKERS

COMPENSATION

WORKERS COMPENSATION IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG

TAIL COVERAGE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE CLAIMS

FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. WHILE CERTAIN PAYMENTS SUCH AS INITIAL MEDICAL

TREATMENT OR TEMPORARY WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR THE INJURED WORKER ARE MADE

QUICKLY, SOME OTHER PAYMENTS ARE MADE OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS, SUCH AS

AWARDS FOR PERMANENT PARTIAL INJURIES. IN ADDITION, SOME PAYMENTS CAN RUN AS

LONG AS THE INJURED WORKERS LIFE, SUCH AS PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS AND

ON-GOING MEDICAL CARE. DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY OF LONG PAYMENT TAILS, THE

REPORTING LAGS ARE GENERALLY SHORT, SETTLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT COMPLEX, AND

MOST OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE CONSIDERED HIGH FREQUENCY WITH MODERATE SEVERITY.

THE LARGEST RESERVE RISK GENERALLY COMES FROM THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY

CLAIMS PROVIDING LIFETIME COVERAGE FOR MEDICAL EXPENSE ARISING FROM A WORKERS

INJURY. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A SOMEWHAT GREATER

THAN MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

WORKERS COMPENSATION RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED

IN THREE COMPONENTS: INDEMNITY LOSSES, MEDICAL LOSSES AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES.

AND ARE BASED ON OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS

RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR

CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. WORKERS COMPENSATION RESERVES

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 26% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THE COMPANYS CHANGE IN

RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 0% FOR 2006, 0% FOR 2005 AND +1%

FOR 2004.

FIDELITY AND SURETY

FIDELITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL

COVERAGE. IT TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE

FIDELITY CLAIMS. THE VOLATILITY OF FIDELITY RESERVES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO

THE TYPE OF BUSINESS OF THE INSURED, THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE INSUREDS BUSINESS

OPERATIONS, AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT

(1)

THESE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE

BODIES THAT EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT A GIVEN CLAIM FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION

BENEFITS IS VALID. DUTIES INCLUDE THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A GIVEN INJURY

AROSE OUT OF THE SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT, OR THE DETERMINATION OF THE DEGREE OF

INJURY WHERE DISPUTES EXIST.

129

AND ATTACHMENT POINT OF COVERAGE. THE UNCERTAINTY

SURROUNDING RESERVES FOR SMALL, COMMERCIAL INSUREDS IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN THE

UNCERTAINTY FOR LARGE COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE HIGH FREQUENCY,

LOW SEVERITY NATURE OF SMALL COMMERCIAL FIDELITY LOSSES PROVIDES FOR STABILITY

IN LOSS ESTIMATES WHEREAS, THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY NATURE OF LOSSES

FOR LARGE INSUREDS RESULTS IN A WIDER RANGE OF ULTIMATE LOSS OUTCOMES.

ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES THAT RELY ON A STABLE PATTERN OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT ARE

GENERALLY NOT APPLICABLE TO LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY POLICIES.

SURETY HAS CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT ARE GENERALLY

CONSIDERED SHORT TAIL COVERAGES WITH SHORT REPORTING LAGS, ALTHOUGH LARGE

INDIVIDUAL CONSTRUCTION AND COMMERCIAL SURETY CONTRACTS CAN RESULT IN A LONG

SETTLEMENT TAIL, BASED ON THE LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT

OR COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION BEING INSURED. (LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS CAN TAKE

MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE.) THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES IN SURETY CORRELATES WITH

ECONOMIC CYCLES AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF SURETY LOSS IS THE INABILITY TO PERFORM

FINANCIALLY. THE VOLATILITY OF SURETY LOSSES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE

OF BUSINESS PERFORMED BY THE INSURED, THE TYPE OF BONDED OBLIGATION, THE AMOUNT

OF LIMIT EXPOSED TO LOSS AND THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS AVAILABLE TO THE INSURER TO

MITIGATE LOSSES, SUCH AS UNBILLED CONTRACT FUNDS, COLLATERAL, FIRST AND THIRD

PARTY INDEMNITY, AND OTHER SECURITY POSITIONS OF AN INSUREDS ASSETS. CERTAIN

CLASSES OF SURETY CLAIMS ARE VERY HIGH SEVERITY, LOW FREQUENCY IN NATURE. THESE

CAN INCLUDE LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS INVOLVED WITH ONE OR MULTIPLE LARGE,

COMPLEX PROJECTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN LARGE COMMERCIAL SURETY EXPOSURES. OTHER

CLAIM FACTORS AFFECTING RESERVE VARIABILITY OF SURETY INCLUDE LITIGATION

RELATED TO AMOUNTS OWED BY AND DUE THE INSURED (E.G., SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION

EFFORTS) AND THE RESULTS OF FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF AN INSURED.

HISTORICALLY, THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE

ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -15%

TO +138% (AVERAGING +20%) FOR THE COMPANY AND -9% TO +24% (AVERAGING +7%)

FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANYS YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY AND

ARE BASED ON OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. BECAUSE THE HIGH END OF THE

COMPANYS RANGE WAS DUE TO ACQUIRED BUSINESS IN 2004, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

THE INDUSTRYS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY

POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. FIDELITY

AND SURETY RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL LOSS

RESERVES.

IN GENERAL, DEVELOPMENTS ON SINGLE LARGE CLAIMS (BOTH

ADVERSE AND FAVORABLE) ARE A PRIMARY SOURCE OF CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR

THIS PRODUCT LINE.

THE COMPANYS CHANGE IN

RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -5% FOR 2006, 0% FOR 2005 AND +138%

FOR 2004. THE 2006 CHANGE WAS DUE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED LARGE LOSS ACTIVITY. THE

2004 CHANGE RESULTED FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESS, INCLUDING A LARGE CONSTRUCTION

CONTRACTOR LOSS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 77 OF THIS NARRATIVE.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL

COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO

PHYSICAL DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE

PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE

TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. REPORTING LAGS ARE RELATIVELY SHORT AND THE CLAIM

SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY GENERALLY IS THE LEAST

COMPLEX OF THE LIABILITY PRODUCTS. IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A HIGH FREQUENCY,

LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY PRODUCT LINE. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS

LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN

FIVE COMPONENTS: BODILY INJURY LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY, NO-FAULT

LOSSES, COLLISION CLAIMS AND COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS. THESE LAST TWO COMPONENTS

HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE FACTORS

ARE NOT PRESENTED.

HISTORICALLY, THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE

ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -9%

TO +1% (AVERAGING -4%) FOR THE COMPANY AND -7% TO 0% (AVERAGING -3%)

FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANYS YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY AND

ARE BASED ON OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS

RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR

CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 4% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THE COMPANYS CHANGE IN

RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -7% FOR 2006, -9% FOR

2005 AND -6% FOR 2004. THE DECREASES IN 2006 AND 2005 WERE PRIMARILY

DUE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES AS

WELL AS INITIATIVES TO FIGHT FRAUD. THE 2004 CHANGE WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN

EXPECTED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY, WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN PRINCIPALLY

CAUSED BY SOCIETAL TRENDS AS WELL AS FRAUD INITIATIVES.

HOMEOWNERS AND

PERSONAL LINES OTHER

HOMEOWNERS IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE.

MOST PAYMENTS ARE RELATED TO THE PROPERTY PORTION OF THE POLICY, WHERE THE

CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED

AND THE INSURER. CLAIMS ON PROPERTY COVERAGE ARE TYPICALLY REPORTED SOON AFTER

THE ACTUAL DAMAGE OCCURS, ALTHOUGH DELAYS OF SEVERAL MONTHS ARE NOT UNUSUAL.

THE CLAIM IS SETTLED WHEN THE TWO PARTIES AGREE ON THE AMOUNT DUE IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE POLICY CONTRACT LANGUAGE AND THE APPROPRIATE PAYMENT IS MADE (OR

ALTERNATIVELY, THE PROPERTY REPLACEMENT/REPAIR IS PERFORMED BY THE INSURER).

THE RESULTING SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS TYPICALLY FAIRLY SHORT TERM, ALTHOUGH

EXCEPTIONS DO EXIST.

THE LIABILITY PORTION OF THE HOMEOWNERS POLICY

GENERATES CLAIMS WHICH TAKE LONGER TO PAY DUE TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF LITIGATION

AND NEGOTIATION, BUT WITH GENERALLY SMALL REPORTING LAGS. IN ADDITION, RESERVES

RELATED TO UMBRELLA COVERAGES HAVE GREATER UNCERTAINTY SINCE UMBRELLA LIABILITY

PAYMENTS ARE OFTEN MADE FAR INTO THE FUTURE.

OVERALL, THE LINE IS GENERALLY HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO

MODERATE SEVERITY (EXCEPT FOR CATASTROPHES), WITH SIMPLE TO MODERATE CLAIM

COMPLEXITY.

HOMEOWNERS RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN TWO

COMPONENTS: NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED LOSSES AND CATASTROPHE LOSS PAYMENTS.

HISTORICALLY, THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE

ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -31%

TO +3% (AVERAGING -11%) FOR THE COMPANY AND -9% TO +11% (AVERAGING -2%)

FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANYS YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY AND

ARE BASED ON OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS

RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR

CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. HOMEOWNERS AND PERSONAL

LINES OTHER RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 2% OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL LOSS

RESERVES.

THIS LINE COMBINES BOTH LIABILITY AND PROPERTY

COVERAGES; HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVES RELATE TO PROPERTY. WHILE

PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE, THE ONE YEAR CHANGE CAN BE MORE

VOLATILE THAN THE LONGER TAIL PRODUCT LINES. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE

MAJORITY OF THE RESERVE RELATES TO THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR, WHICH IS

SUBJECT TO THE MOST UNCERTAINTY FOR ALL PRODUCT LINES. THIS RECENT ACCIDENT

YEAR UNCERTAINTY IS RELEVANT TO PROPERTY DUE TO WEATHER RELATED EVENTS WHICH

TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE LAST HALF OF THE YEAR AND GENERALLY DO NOT CLEARLY

RESOLVE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

THE COMPANYS CHANGE IN

RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -22% FOR 2006, +3% FOR 2005

AND -31% FOR 2004. THE 2006 CHANGE WAS DUE TO LOWER THAN EXPECTED

ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA AS WELL AS BETTER THAN

EXPECTED NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY, DUE IN PART TO CHANGES

IN THE MARKETPLACE, SUCH AS HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND FEWER SMALL-DOLLAR CLAIMS,

AND CONTINUED EVIDENCE OF A LESS THAN EXPECTED IMPACT FROM DEMAND SURGE. THE

2005 CHANGE WAS DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT FROM THE 2004 FLORIDA

HURRICANES. THE 2004 CHANGE WAS DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE

133

LOSS

DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY FROM FEWER CLAIM COUNTS FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2003 AS A

RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING HIGHER POLICY DEDUCTIBLE LEVELS

AND FEWER SMALL DOLLAR CLAIMS.

INTERNATIONAL AND

OTHER

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER INCLUDES PRODUCTS WRITTEN BY

INTERNATIONAL AND LLOYDS AND OTHER PRODUCTS NOT DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE PRINCIPAL

COMPONENT OF OTHER CLAIM RESERVES IS ASSUMED REINSURANCE WRITTEN ON AN

EXCESS-OF-LOSS BASIS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE REINSURANCE OF NON-U.S. EXPOSURES, AND

IS PRIMARILY RUNOFF BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER CLAIM LIABILITIES RESULT FROM

A MIX OF COVERAGES, CURRENCIES AND JURISDICTIONS/COUNTRIES. THE COMMON

CHARACTERISTIC IS THE NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE ANALYSIS TO THE INDIVIDUAL

COMPONENT, AND THE INABILITY TO RELY ON DATA CHARACTERIZATIONS AND REPORTING

REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. STATUTORY REPORTING FRAMEWORK.

DUE TO CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS MIX FOR THIS LINE OVER

TIME, THE RECENTLY INCURRED CLAIM LIABILITIES ARE RELATIVELY SHORT TERM (DUE TO

BOTH THE PRODUCTS AND THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED, E.G., THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND

AND THE UNITED KINGDOM), WHILE THE OLDER LIABILITIES INCLUDE SOME FROM RUNOFF

OPERATIONS THAT ARE EXTREMELY LONG TAIL (E.G., U.S. EXCESS LIABILITIES

REINSURED THROUGH THE LONDON MARKET, AND SEVERAL UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF).

THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC

COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION, THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (E.G.,

UNDERWRITING POOL VERSUS DIRECT), AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE INSURANCE SALE TO

THE INSURED HAZARD (E.G., INSURED AND INSURER LOCATED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES).

IN PARTICULAR, LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF MAY

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS, SETTLEMENT LAGS AND CLAIM COMPLEXITY, DUE

TO THE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER POOL MEMBERS OR CO-INSURERS THROUGH A

BROKER OR LEAD-INSURER FOR CLAIM SETTLEMENT PURPOSES.

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER RESERVES ARE GENERALLY

ANALYZED BY PROGRAM/POOL, COUNTRY AND GENERAL COVERAGE CATEGORY (E.G., U.S.

LIABILITYEXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE, OR GENERAL LIABILITYMUNICIPALITIESBY

COUNTRY). THE BUSINESS IS ALSO GENERALLY SPLIT BY DIRECT VERSUS ASSUMED

REINSURANCE FOR A GIVEN COVERAGE/JURISDICTION. WHERE THE UNDERLYING INSURED

HAZARD IS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE UNDERLYING COVERAGES ARE GENERALLY

SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND AUTOMOBILE

DISCUSSION ABOVE, BUT UNDER A DIFFERENT LEGAL SYSTEM. WHERE THE UNDERLYING

HAZARD IS WITHIN THE U.S., THE COVERAGE INVOLVED IS TYPICALLY THAT OF GENERAL

LIABILITY, BUT ON AN EXCESS OR EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE BASIS. EXCESS

EXPOSURE REQUIRES THE INSURED TO PROVE NOT ONLY CLAIMS UNDER THE POLICY, BUT

ALSO THE PRIOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS REACHING UP TO THE EXCESS POLICYS ATTACHMENT

POINT.

REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A

MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY EVALUATES

AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY

REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM

REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE

COMPANY BECOMES INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF

THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST

THE REINSURERS TO DETERMINE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND

AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET

OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE

ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ONGOING REVIEW OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING,

LENGTH OF COLLECTION PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES,

APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR

UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS

INVOLVING ESTIMATES. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL

INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES. THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 DECLINED BY $31 MILLION FROM THE SAME DATE IN 2005.

RECOVERABLES ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS

RELATE PRIMARILY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED

ANNUITIES AND REMAINS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE

COMPANIES ISSUING THE ANNUITIES. RECOVERABLES ATTRIBUTABLE TO MANDATORY POOLS

AND ASSOCIATIONS RELATE PRIMARILY TO WORKERS COMPENSATION SERVICE BUSINESS AND

HAVE THE OBLIGATION OF THE PARTICIPATING INSURANCE COMPANIES ON A JOINT AND

SEVERAL BASIS SUPPORTING THESE CESSIONS.

SUCH, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MAY DIFFER

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED IF THE SECURITY WAS SOLD

IMMEDIATELY.

FAIR VALUE IS ESTABLISHED

AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION BY INTERNAL ANALYSIS OR EXTERNAL APPRAISERS, USING

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND OTHER ACCEPTABLE TECHNIQUES. THE COMPANY HAD

VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS

OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS,

WHICH ARE GENERALLY NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INSTRUMENTS IN EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES

AND, HISTORICALLY, HAVE A HOLDING PERIOD OF FOUR TO SEVEN YEARS. THESE

INVESTMENTS HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN MADE IN THE HEALTH CARE, SOFTWARE AND COMPUTER

SERVICES, AND NETWORKING

136

AND INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGIES INFRASTRUCTURES INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY IS INVOLVED WITH

VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES EARLY IN THEIR FORMATION, AS THEY ARE DEVELOPING AND

DETERMINING THE VIABILITY OF, AND MARKET DEMAND FOR, THEIR PRODUCT. GENERALLY,

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES TO RECORD REVENUES

IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT, WHICH CAN OFTEN TAKE THREE TO FOUR

YEARS, AND DOES NOT GENERALLY EXPECT THEM TO BECOME PROFITABLE FOR AN EVEN

LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.

CERTAIN VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS OF THESE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE

REPORTED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE

DETERMINED BY THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER AND REVIEWED BY THE COMPANY FOR

INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THERE IS NO PUBLIC MARKET. THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER

REVIEWS SUCH FACTORS AS RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET STABILITY,

GROWTH, AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTAL STATISTICS IN

ESTIMATING FAIR VALUES OF SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS.

WITH RESPECT TO THE

COMPANYS VALUATION OF SUCH NON-PUBLICLY TRADED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, ON

A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND THE EXTERNAL FUND

MANAGER REVIEW AND CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE VALUATION

OF THE INVESTMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS.

FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

·

THE

INVESTEES MOST RECENT FINANCING EVENTS;

·

AN

ANALYSIS OF WHETHER A FUNDAMENTAL DETERIORATION OR IMPROVEMENT HAS OCCURRED;

·

WHETHER

THE INVESTEES PROGRESS HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE OR LESS THAN EXPECTED;

·

WHETHER

OR NOT THE VALUATIONS HAVE IMPROVED OR DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE INVESTEES

MARKET SECTOR;

·

WHETHER

OR NOT THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER AND THE COMPANY BELIEVE IT IS PROBABLE THAT

THE INVESTEE WILL NEED FINANCING WITHIN SIX MONTHS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN OUR

CARRYING VALUE; AND

·

WHETHER

OR NOT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY, ENABLING IT TO RECEIVE VALUE

EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN OUR COST.

THE QUARTERLY VALUATION

PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ONGOING

RESPONSIBILITY TO FREQUENTLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THOSE INVESTED

ASSETS, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EVENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO

IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS.

NON-PUBLICLY TRADED

INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES

NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS (AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE), PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, OTHER

LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, AND CERTAIN FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. THE COMPANY USES THE

EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR JOINT VENTURES, LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND

CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY SECURITIES. CERTAIN OTHER PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS,

INCLUDING VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

THESE NON-PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES ARE

VALUED BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, RECENT FINANCIAL

INFORMATION AND OTHER MARKET DATA.

IMPAIRMENTS

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WHEN AN

INVESTED ASSETS VALUE DECLINES BELOW COST, ADJUSTED FOR ACCRETION,

AMORTIZATION AND PREVIOUS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS (NEW COST BASIS),

AND THE CHANGE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, OR IF IT IS DETERMINED

THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER ALL AMOUNTS DUE PURSUANT TO THE

ISSUERS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO SALE OR MATURITY. WHEN THE COMPANY

DETERMINES THAT AN INVESTED ASSET IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, THE

INVESTED ASSET IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT

IS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS AS A REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSS. THE FAIR VALUE THEN

BECOMES THE NEW COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT AND ANY SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN

FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED AT DISPOSITION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES A REALIZED LOSS WHEN IMPAIRMENT

IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY EVEN IF A DECISION TO SELL AN INVESTED

ASSET HAS NOT BEEN MADE. WHEN THE COMPANY HAS DECIDED TO SELL A TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTED ASSET AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTED ASSET TO FULLY RECOVER PRIOR TO THE EXPECTED TIME OF

SALE, THE INVESTED ASSET IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THE DECISION TO SELL IS MADE.

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER A DECLINE IS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR

VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF

THE ISSUER, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY.

THE COMPANYS

PROCESS FOR REVIEWING INVESTED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENTS DURING ANY QUARTER

INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING.

·

IDENTIFICATION

AND EVALUATION OF INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE POSSIBLE INDICATIONS OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF INVESTMENTS WITH

GROSS UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES THAT HAVE FAIR VALUES LESS THAN 80% OF COST

FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE MONTHS OR MORE;

·

REVIEW

OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS BASED ON THE INVESTEES CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY,

NEAR-TERM RECOVERY PROSPECTS AND OTHER FACTORS;

·

CONSIDERATION

OF EVIDENTIAL MATTER, INCLUDING AN EVALUATION OF FACTORS OR TRIGGERS THAT MAY

CAUSE INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENTS TO QUALIFY AS HAVING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS; AND

·

DETERMINATION OF THE STATUS

OF EACH ANALYZED INVESTMENT AS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY OR NOT, WITH DOCUMENTATION

OF THE RATIONALE FOR THE DECISION.

SALES OF

TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INVESTED ASSETS

THE COMPANY MAY, FROM TIME

TO TIME, SELL INVESTED ASSETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE THAT WERE

CONSIDERED TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FOR

ALL SUBSEQUENT

138

SALES OF

INVESTED ASSETS THAT WERE CONSIDERED TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT THE BALANCE SHEET

DATE, THE COMPANY CONTEMPORANEOUSLY DOCUMENTS ITS RATIONALE FOR ITS CHANGE IN

INTENT OR ABILITY TO HOLD TO RECOVERY. THE RATIONALE FOR THE CHANGE IN THE

COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT GENERALLY FOCUSES ON CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC FACTS

AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO THE INVESTED ASSET SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET

DATE, SIGNIFICANT UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY NEEDS, OR

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

FIXED MATURITIES

AND EQUITY SECURITIES

AN INVESTMENT IN A FIXED

MATURITY OR EQUITY SECURITY WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR SALE IS IMPAIRED IF ITS FAIR

VALUE FALLS BELOW ITS COST OR NEW COST BASIS AND THE DECLINE IS CONSIDERED TO

BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. A FIXED MATURITY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SECURITYS CONTRACTUAL TERMS OR WHERE THE COMPANY DOES

NOT HAVE THE INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY. EQUITY SECURITIES ARE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED WHEN IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT THE COMPANY WILL

NOT RECOVER ITS COST OVER THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD. FURTHER, FOR SECURITIES

EXPECTED TO BE SOLD, AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IF

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY TO RECOVER PRIOR TO

THE EXPECTED DATE OF SALE. ADDITIONALLY, FOR CERTAIN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL

ASSETS WITH CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS (INCLUDING ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), THE

COMPANY PERIODICALLY UPDATES ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS OVER THE LIFE OF

THE SECURITY. IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITIZED

FINANCIAL ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND THERE HAS BEEN A DECREASE

IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS SINCE THE LAST REVISED

ESTIMATE, CONSIDERING BOTH TIMING AND AMOUNT, THEN AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED.

REAL ESTATE

INVESTMENTS

THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REAL ESTATE PROPERTY IS

REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT

THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT INCLUDES

AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND

EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS MEASURED AS

THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

MORTGAGE LOANS

A MORTGAGE LOAN IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN IT IS

PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST

AMOUNTS DUE. FOR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED, A RESERVE

IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST AND FAIR MARKET

VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY USES

INTEREST RATES REFLECTING THE CURRENT REAL ESTATE FINANCING MARKET RETURNS.

IMPAIRED LOANS WERE NOT MATERIAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005.

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLICLY TRADED

INVESTMENTS

VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT BY THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER AND THE COMPANYS

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF, BASED ON THE SPECIFIC

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

RECOVER ALL OF THE COST OF AN INDIVIDUAL HOLDING. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION,

PLEASE SEE THE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS SECTIONS UNDER THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

ABOVE.

139

GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENTS

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(FAS 142),

PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL SUBSEQUENT TO ACQUISITION. ACCORDINGLY,

THE COMPANY PERFORMS A REVIEW ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, OF GOODWILL HELD BY

ITS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE THE COMPANYS THREE OPERATING AND REPORTABLE

SEGMENTS: BUSINESS INSURANCE, FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL

INSURANCE AND PERSONAL INSURANCE.

IN AUGUST 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A REALIGNMENT

OF TWO OF ITS THREE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE FORMER COMMERCIAL AND

SPECIALTY SEGMENTS WERE REALIGNED INTO THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT AND THE

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT. THE PERSONAL

SEGMENT WAS RENAMED PERSONAL INSURANCE. GOODWILL WAS REALLOCATED AMONG THE

REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO ALIGN THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS WITH THE

APPROPRIATE REPORTING SEGMENT.

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 142, IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO IDENTIFY

ANY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT USING A MULTIPLE-OF-EARNINGS APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS ARE

THEN COMPARED TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEED THEIR FAIR VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS

PERFORMED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY. THE COMPANYS REVIEW

RESULTED IN NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005.

FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS

THIS REPORT MAY CONTAIN, AND MANAGEMENT MAY MAKE,

CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE

SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. ALL STATEMENTS, OTHER THAN STATEMENTS

OF HISTORICAL FACTS, MAY BE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SPECIFICALLY, THE

COMPANY MAY MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, PREMIUM VOLUME, INCOME FROM CONTINUING

OPERATIONS, NET AND OPERATING INCOME AND RETURN ON EQUITY), FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND LIQUIDITY; THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS AND OTHER RESERVES (INCLUDING,

AMONG OTHERS, ASBESTOS CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS); THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF

REINSURANCE COVERAGE; AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. SUCH STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND GENERALLY

BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL, THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED IN, OR IMPLIED OR PROJECTED BY, THE

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION AND STATEMENTS.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD

CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER, SEE ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS AND

ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES.

STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT OR AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE

MADE, AND THE COMPANY UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ITS FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE

CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND PRICES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER RELEVANT MARKET RATE OR PRICE CHANGES. MARKET RISK IS

DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE

RELATED UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE TRADED. THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE

COMPANYS PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES AND HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE COMPANYS MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

DERIVATIVES, ARE PRIMARILY ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005 WAS $72.27 BILLION AND $68.29

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 87% AND 86% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY

SECURITIES, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, APPROXIMATELY 6%

OF THE COMPANYS INVESTED ASSETS WERE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE

COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO EQUITY PRICE RISK IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY HAS NO

DIRECT COMMODITY RISK.

THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS

INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES.

THE PORTFOLIO DURATION RELATIVE TO THE LIABILITIES DURATION IS PRIMARILY

MANAGED THROUGH CASH MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND TREASURY FUTURES TRANSACTIONS.

THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK FOR ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT

IS INTEREST RATE RISK AT THE TIME OF REFINANCING. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND EVALUATES REFINANCING OPPORTUNITIES AS MATURITY

DATES APPROACH. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS DEBT SEE

NOTE 7 TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS.

THE COMPANYS FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURE IS

CONCENTRATED IN THE COMPANYS INVESTED ASSETS AND INSURANCE RESERVES

DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. CASH FLOWS FROM THE COMPANYS FOREIGN

OPERATIONS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTS

DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE INVESTMENTS

PRIMARILY TO FUND INSURANCE RESERVES AND OTHER LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN THE

SAME CURRENCY, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

EXPOSURE. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING COMPRISED

APPROXIMATELY 2.8% AND 2.4% OF THE TOTAL INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY ACCOUNTED FOR

MORE THAN 1.8% OF THE COMPANYS INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 OR 2005.

THERE WERE NO OTHER

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW

THOSE EXPOSURES WERE MANAGED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 COMPARED

TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY

ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ITS PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW

THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS BASED UPON WHAT IS

KNOWN OR EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS.

SENSITIVITY

ANALYSIS

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS

DEFINED AS THE MEASUREMENT OF POTENTIAL LOSS IN FUTURE EARNINGS, FAIR VALUES OR

CASH FLOWS OF MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS RESULTING FROM ONE OR MORE SELECTED

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET RATES OR PRICES OVER A

SELECTED TIME. IN THE COMPANYS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, A HYPOTHETICAL

CHANGE IN MARKET RATES IS SELECTED THAT IS EXPECTED TO REFLECT REASONABLY

POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN THOSE RATES. NEAR-TERM MEANS A PERIOD OF TIME

GOING FORWARD UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET

RATES ASSUMED IN THIS DISCLOSURE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

DOES NOT REFLECT THE RESULTS OF ANY ACTIONS THAT WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE COMPANY TO

MITIGATE SUCH HYPOTHETICAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE.

141

INTEREST RATE RISK

IN THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, THE COMPANY USES

FAIR VALUES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL

INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER

THAN TRADING: FIXED MATURITIES, NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, MORTGAGE

LOANS, SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, DEBT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO THE COMPANYS MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INTEREST

RATE RISK. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USES A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN

INTEREST RATES TO MEASURE THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MODEL.

FOR INVESTED ASSETS WITH PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE RISK, ESTIMATES OF PORTFOLIO DURATION AND CONVEXITY ARE USED TO MODEL THE

LOSS OF FAIR VALUE THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM A PARALLEL INCREASE IN

INTEREST RATES. DURATIONS ON INVESTED ASSETS ARE ADJUSTED FOR CALL, PUT AND

INTEREST RATE RESET FEATURES. DURATIONS ON TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES ARE ADJUSTED

FOR THE FACT THAT THE YIELDS ON SUCH SECURITIES DO NOT NORMALLY MOVE IN

LOCKSTEP WITH CHANGES IN THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE. FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO

DURATIONS ARE CALCULATED ON A MARKET VALUE WEIGHTED BASIS, INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST,

USING HOLDINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005.

FOR DEBT, THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY

CALCULATING HYPOTHETICAL DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005 ENDING PRICES BASED ON

YIELDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE, COMPARING SUCH HYPOTHETICAL

ENDING PRICES TO ACTUAL ENDING PRICES, AND MULTIPLYING THE DIFFERENCE BY THE

PAR OR SECURITIES OUTSTANDING.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USED BY THE COMPANY

PRODUCES A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY

$2.3 BILLION AND $2.2 BILLION BASED ON A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST

RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

THE LOSS ESTIMATES DO NOT

TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE INTERVENTIONS THAT THE COMPANY MIGHT

REASONABLY UNDERTAKE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE OR AVOID LOSSES THAT WOULD RESULT

FROM EMERGING INTEREST RATE TRENDS. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS VALUE ONLY REFLECTS

THE IMPACT OF AN INTEREST RATE INCREASE ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AS A RESULT, THE LOSS VALUE EXCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WHICH IF INCLUDED IN THE

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, WOULD MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE LOSS IN FAIR VALUE

ASSOCIATED WITH A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS FROM FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS. A

HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IS USED

TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FOREIGN DENOMINATED HOLDINGS.

THE POTENTIAL LOSS IS REDUCED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE

USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE

COMPANYS ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT A HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF

FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A LOSS IN FAIR

VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $438 MILLION AND $374 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

ACCOUNTS OF THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY). ON APRIL 1, 2004, TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY

CORP. (TPC) MERGED WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC.

(SPC), AS A RESULT OF WHICH TPC BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THIS TRANSACTION

WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE ACQUISITION WITH TPC TREATED AS THE ACCOUNTING

ACQUIRER. ACCORDINGLY, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE

BUSINESS COMBINATION, USING TPCS HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND APPLYING

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS OF SPC

AS OF APRIL 1, 2004. BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF SPC WERE CONSOLIDATED WITH TPCS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ACCORDINGLY, ALL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

PRESENTED HEREIN FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005

REFLECTS THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS OF SPC AND TPC. THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION

PRESENTED HEREIN FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 REFLECTS

ONLY THE ACCOUNTS OF TPC FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 AND THE

CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS OF SPC AND TPC FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2004.

THE PREPARATION OF THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO PRIOR YEARS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEARS PRESENTATION, INCLUDING RECLASSIFICATIONS

RELATED TO THE REALIGNMENT OF THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS

DESCRIBED IN THE NATURE OF OPERATIONS SECTION OF THIS NOTE. ALL MATERIAL

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

ADOPTION OF NEW

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN

AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R)

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB

STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R)

(FAS 158). FAS 158

REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER TO RECOGNIZE THE FUNDED STATUS OF A BENEFIT PLAN AS AN

ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, MEASURED AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAN ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE AND THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION, AND TO

RECOGNIZE AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER

SOURCES, NET OF TAX, ACTUARIAL GAINS OR LOSSES AND PRIOR SERVICE COSTS OR

CREDITS THAT ARISE DURING THE PERIOD BUT WHICH ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS COMPONENTS

OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST PURSUANT TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 87,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS

(FAS 87), OR FASB

STATEMENT NO. 106,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

(FAS 106). THE

PROVISIONS OF FAS 87 AND FAS 106 CONTINUE TO APPLY IN MEASURING PLAN ASSETS AND

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, AS OF THE DATE OF THE FISCAL YEAR-END STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL POSITION, AND IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.

THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 158 WERE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2006 AND ARE NOT TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF FAS

158 AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 RESULTED IN AN $80 MILLION REDUCTION, NET OF TAX,

TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS RECOGNIZED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE ENDING

12.

CONSIDERING THE

EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT

YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108,

CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING

MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(SAB 108), AS AN

INTERPRETATION BY THE SEC STAFF OF THE PROCESS OF QUANTIFYING FINANCIAL

STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER A MISSTATEMENT IS

MATERIAL. SAB 108 WAS ISSUED TO ADDRESS DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE USED BY

REGISTRANTS IN QUANTIFYING FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS, AND THE POTENTIAL

UNDER THE CURRENT PRACTICE FOR THE BUILD UP OF IMPROPER AMOUNTS ON THE BALANCE

SHEET. SAB 108 REQUIRES REGISTRANTS TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF CORRECTING ALL

MISSTATEMENTS, INCLUDING BOTH THE CARRYOVER AND REVERSING EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR

STATEMENTS, ON THE CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (I.E., THE INCOME

STATEMENT AND THE BALANCE SHEET). STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 99,

MATERIALITY,

WHICH REQUIRES THAT BOTH QUALITATIVE AND

QUANTITATIVE FACTORS BE EVALUATED IN DETERMINING WHETHER A MISSTATEMENT IS

MATERIAL TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE ISSUANCE OF SAB

108.

SAB 108 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR

THE FIRST INTERIM PERIOD OF THE FIRST FISCAL YEAR ENDING AFTER NOVEMBER 15,

2006, WITH EARLY ADOPTION ENCOURAGED. THE ADOPTION OF SAB 108 AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 HAD NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION

OR LIQUIDITY.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED REVISED

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(FAS 123R), AN

AMENDMENT TO FAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION,

AND A REPLACEMENT OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD

OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK

ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

, AND ITS RELATED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE. FAS

123R REQUIRES PUBLIC ENTITIES TO MEASURE THE COST OF EMPLOYEE SERVICES RECEIVED

IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AWARD OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR

VALUE OF THE AWARD AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT COST OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE

PERIOD.

FAS 123R, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006,

REQUIRES ENTITIES THAT USE THE FAIR-VALUE METHOD OF EITHER RECOGNITION OR

DISCLOSURE UNDER FAS 123 TO APPLY A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE PROSPECTIVE

APPLICATION. UNDER MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION, COMPENSATION COST IS

RECOGNIZED ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR ALL UNVESTED AWARDS, BASED ON

THEIR GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE AS CALCULATED UNDER FAS 123 FOR EITHER RECOGNITION

OR PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE PURPOSES.

IN ADDITION, THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN GRANTS OF

EQUITY AWARDS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE ON THE DATE OF GRANT

HAS BEEN CLARIFIED. FAS 123R STATES THAT AN EMPLOYEES SHARE-BASED AWARD

BECOMES VESTED, FOR EXPENSING PURPOSES, AT THE DATE THAT THE EMPLOYEES RIGHT

TO RECEIVE OR RETAIN EQUITY SHARES IS NO LONGER CONTINGENT ON THE SATISFACTION

OF A MARKET, PERFORMANCE OR SERVICE CONDITION. ACCORDINGLY, AWARDS GRANTED TO

RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ARE NOT CONTINGENT ON SATISFYING A SERVICE

CONDITION AND THEREFORE ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT.

ADDITIONALLY, THE PERIOD OVER WHICH COST IS RECOGNIZED FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO

THOSE WHO BECOME RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE BEFORE THE VESTING

DATE WILL BE FROM THE

GRANT DATE TO THE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE DATE RATHER THAN TO THE VESTING DATE.

THIS GUIDANCE IS TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO NEW OR MODIFIED AWARDS GRANTED

UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 123R.

THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R

AT JANUARY 1, 2006 USING MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

LIQUIDITY. SEE NOTE 11.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

AND ERROR CORRECTIONS

IN MAY 2005, THE FASB

ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 154,

ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND ERROR CORRECTIONS

(FAS 154),

WHICH REPLACED APB OPINION NO. 20,

ACCOUNTING CHANGES,

AND FASB STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 3,

REPORTING

CHANGES IN INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FAS 154 CHANGED THE

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ACCOUNTING FOR AND REPORTING OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLE. IT REQUIRES RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF VOLUNTARY CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE AND CHANGES REQUIRED BY

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS WHEN THE STANDARD DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC TRANSITION

PROVISIONS, UNLESS IT IS IMPRACTICABLE TO DO SO. FAS 154 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR

ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS OF ERRORS IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2005. EARLY ADOPTION WAS PERMITTED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS OF

ERRORS MADE IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 1, 2005. IT DID NOT

CHANGE THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS OF ANY EXISTING ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS,

INCLUDING THOSE THAT WERE IN A TRANSITION PHASE AS OF DECEMBER 15, 2005. THE

ADOPTION OF FAS 154 AT JANUARY 1, 2006 HAD NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

THE MEANING OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT AND ITS APPLICATION TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE

FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) FAS 115-1 AND FAS 124-1,

THE MEANING OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT AND ITS APPLICATION TO

CERTAIN INVESTMENTS.

THE FSP ADDRESSES THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHEN

AN INVESTMENT IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED, WHETHER THAT IMPAIRMENT IS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AND THE MEASUREMENT OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS. IT REQUIRES

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW COST BASIS SUBSEQUENT TO THE RECOGNITION OF AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT AND CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ABOUT UNREALIZED LOSSES

THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED AS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. THE FSP IS

EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2005. THE

COMPANY HAD PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED THESE REQUIREMENTS. THEREFORE, THE ADOPTION

OF THE FSP HAD NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

AMERICAN JOBS

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004,

CONGRESS ENACTED THE

APPROVED A DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AJCA TO REPATRIATE

FOREIGN EARNINGS PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE

COMPANY REPATRIATED $158 MILLION OF CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EARNINGS INVESTED

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAX

EXPENSE OF $8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE (ACSEC) ISSUED STATEMENT OF POSITION 05-1,

ACCOUNTING BY INSURANCE ENTERPRISES FOR DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS IN

CONNECTION WITH MODIFICATIONS OR EXCHANGES OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS

(SOP 05-1). SOP 05-1 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING BY INSURANCE

NEW CONTRACT, OR BY AMENDMENT, ENDORSEMENT, OR RIDER TO A CONTRACT, OR BY THE

ELECTION OF A FEATURE OR COVERAGE WITHIN A CONTRACT.

SOP 05-1 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR INTERNAL REPLACEMENTS OCCURRING IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2006, WITH EARLIER ADOPTION ENCOURAGED. THE ADOPTION OF SOP 05-1

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

ACCOUNTING FOR

CERTAIN HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 155,

AND 140

(FAS 155). FAS

155 NULLIFIES THE GUIDANCE IN THE FASBS DERIVATIVES IMPLEMENTATION GROUP ISSUE

ARE FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES OR HYBRID INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN AN EMBEDDED

DERIVATIVE REQUIRING BIFURCATION.

FAS 155 PERMITS ENTITIES TO FAIR VALUE ANY HYBRID

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT CONTAINS AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD

REQUIRE BIFURCATION. THIS ELECTION IS ON A CONTRACT-BY-CONTRACT BASIS AND IS

IRREVOCABLE. ADDITIONALLY, FAS 155 NARROWS THE EXCEPTION AFFORDED TO

INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS AND PRINCIPAL-ONLY STRIPS FROM DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING.  IN ADDITION, FAS 155 CLARIFIES THAT

FAS 155 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

BASIS) EVENT OCCURRING AFTER THE BEGINNING OF AN ENTITYS FISCAL YEAR THAT

BEGINS AFTER SEPTEMBER 15, 2006. AT ADOPTION, FOR CONTRACTS WHERE THE FAIR

OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE EXISTING BIFURCATED HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMBINED HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT

SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED

ACCOUNTING FOR

UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES - AN INTERPRETATION

OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN A COMPANYS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND PRESCRIBES THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION

TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. FIN 48 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON

DE-RECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM

PERIODS, DISCLOSURE AND TRANSITION.

UNDER FIN 48, EVALUATION OF A TAX POSITION IS A

TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS

MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT A TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION,

INCLUDING THE RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION BASED ON THE

TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE A TAX POSITION

THAT MEETS THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF

BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A TAX POSITION IS

MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT

LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.

TAX POSITIONS THAT PREVIOUSLY FAILED TO MEET THE

MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST

SUBSEQUENT PERIOD IN WHICH THE THRESHOLD IS MET. PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED TAX

POSITIONS THAT NO LONGER MEET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT CRITERIA SHOULD BE

DE-RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST SUBSEQUENT FINANCIAL REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE

THRESHOLD IS NO LONGER MET.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ANNOUNCED THAT IT

PLANS TO ISSUE A FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) TO AMEND FIN 48. THE PROPOSED FSP IS

EXPECTED TO BE EXPOSED FOR A 30-DAY COMMENT PERIOD AND, IF ADOPTED, WOULD

BE EFFECTIVE AT THE TIME A COMPANY INITIALLY ADOPTS FIN 48.

FIN 48 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2006. THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF

ADOPTING FIN 48 AT JANUARY 1, 2007, BEFORE CONSIDERING THE IMPACT, IF ANY,

OF THE YET TO BE ISSUED FSP, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157,

FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(FAS

157). FAS 157 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING

FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. IT APPLIES TO

OTHER PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT REQUIRE OR PERMIT FAIR VALUE BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY

NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE STATEMENT DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE

THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

FAS 157 ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY TO INCREASE

CONSISTENCY AND COMPARABILITY IN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES. THE

HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE INPUTS USED IN VALUATION AND GIVES THE HIGHEST

PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL SHOULD

BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE.

FAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

EXPECT THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 157 TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

FASB ISSUED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 06-4,

ACCOUNTING FOR DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ASPECTS

OF ENDORSEMENT SPLIT-DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS

(EITF 06-4).

EITF 06-4 REQUIRES A COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY AND RELATED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ENDORSEMENT SPLIT-DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT

PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO AN EMPLOYEE THAT EXTENDS TO POSTRETIREMENT PERIODS. THE

PROVISIONS OF EITF 06-4 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

FOR MANY FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS INCLUDING

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE CONTRACTS. ENTITIES ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE IN EARNINGS AND TO

EXPENSE UPFRONT COST AND FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ITEM FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION IS ELECTED. ENTITIES ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE REQUIRED TO

DISTINGUISH ON THE FACE OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, THE FAIR VALUE

OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED AND

SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING ANOTHER MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE. AN

ENTITY CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS BY EITHER REPORTING THE FAIR VALUE AND

NON-FAIR-VALUE CARRYING AMOUNTS AS SEPARATE LINE ITEMS OR AGGREGATE THOSE

AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSE PARENTHETICALLY THE AMOUNT OF FAIR VALUE INCLUDED IN THE

AGGREGATE AMOUNT.

FAS 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007. UPON ADOPTION, AN ENTITY

IS PERMITTED TO ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION IRREVOCABLY FOR ANY EXISTING ASSET

OR LIABILITY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE STANDARD. THE ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT WOULD BE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE DATE OF

INITIAL ADOPTION.

INVESTMENTS

FIXED MATURITIES INCLUDE BONDS, NOTES AND REDEEMABLE

PREFERRED STOCKS. FIXED MATURITIES, INCLUDING INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO SECURITIES

LENDING AGREEMENTS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT

FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF INCOME TAXES,

CREDITED OR CHARGED DIRECTLY TO ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM

NONOWNER SOURCES. EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE COMMON AND NONREDEEMABLE

DIRECTLY OWNED. REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION. BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE

SHORTER OF THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OF THE BUILDING OR 39 YEARS. ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION ON REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES WAS $82 MILLION AND

$48 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. REAL ESTATE HELD

FOR SALE IS CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO

SELL.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED

IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE, UNRELATED WILLING PARTIES. AS

SUCH, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MAY DIFFER

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED IF THE SECURITY WAS SOLD

IMMEDIATELY.

REAL ESTATE

FAIR VALUE IS ESTABLISHED

AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION BY INTERNAL ANALYSIS OR EXTERNAL APPRAISERS, USING

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND OTHER ACCEPTABLE TECHNIQUES. THE COMPANY HAD

NO REAL ESTATE HELD FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 OR 2005.

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY NON-PUBLICLY TRADED

INSTRUMENTS IN EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES AND, HISTORICALLY, HAVE A HOLDING PERIOD

OF FOUR TO SEVEN YEARS. THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN MADE IN THE

HEALTH CARE, SOFTWARE AND COMPUTER SERVICES, AND NETWORKING AND INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGIES INFRASTRUCTURES INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY IS INVOLVED WITH

VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES EARLY IN THEIR FORMATION, AS THEY ARE DEVELOPING AND

DETERMINING THE VIABILITY OF, AND MARKET DEMAND FOR, THEIR PRODUCT. GENERALLY,

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES TO RECORD REVENUES

IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT, WHICH CAN OFTEN TAKE THREE TO FOUR

YEARS, AND DOES NOT GENERALLY EXPECT THEM TO BECOME PROFITABLE FOR AN EVEN

LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.

CERTAIN VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS OF THESE VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IS BASED

ON AN ESTIMATE DETERMINED BY THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER AND REVIEWED BY THE

COMPANY FOR INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THERE IS NO PUBLIC MARKET. THE EXTERNAL FUND

MANAGER REVIEWS SUCH FACTORS AS RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE

SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH, AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTAL

STATISTICS IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUES OF SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS.

WITH RESPECT TO THE

COMPANYS VALUATION OF SUCH NON-PUBLICLY TRADED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, ON

A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND THE EXTERNAL FUND

MANAGER REVIEW AND CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE VALUATION

OF THE INVESTMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS.

FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

THE INVESTEE WILL NEED FINANCING WITHIN SIX MONTHS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN OUR

CARRYING VALUE; AND

·

WHETHER

OR NOT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY, ENABLING IT TO RECEIVE VALUE

EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN OUR COST.

THE QUARTERLY VALUATION

PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ONGOING

RESPONSIBILITY TO FREQUENTLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THOSE INVESTED

ASSETS, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EVENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO

IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS.

NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO INCLUDES NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS (AS DISCUSSED ABOVE), PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT

VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, AND CERTAIN FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. THE

COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR JOINT VENTURES, LIMITED

PARTNERSHIPS AND CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY SECURITIES. CERTAIN OTHER PRIVATE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED AT

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

THESE

NON-PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS MANAGEMENT

JUDGMENT, RECENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER MARKET DATA.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS WHEN AN INVESTED ASSETS VALUE DECLINES BELOW COST, ADJUSTED

FOR ACCRETION, AMORTIZATION AND PREVIOUS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS (NEW

COST BASIS), AND THE CHANGE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, OR IF IT IS

DETERMINED THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER ALL AMOUNTS DUE

PURSUANT TO THE ISSUERS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO SALE OR MATURITY. WHEN

THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN INVESTED ASSET IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED, THE INVESTED ASSET IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AND THE AMOUNT OF

THE IMPAIRMENT IS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS AS A REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSS. THE FAIR

VALUE THEN BECOMES THE NEW COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT AND ANY SUBSEQUENT

RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED AT DISPOSITION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES A

REALIZED LOSS WHEN IMPAIRMENT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY EVEN IF A

DECISION TO SELL AN INVESTED ASSET HAS NOT BEEN MADE. WHEN THE COMPANY HAS

DECIDED TO SELL A TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTED ASSET AND

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTED ASSET TO FULLY

RECOVER PRIOR TO THE EXPECTED TIME OF SALE, THE INVESTED ASSET IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DECISION TO SELL IS

MADE.

FACTORS CONSIDERED IN

DETERMINING WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF

TIME AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST, THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND

INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY

ANTICIPATED RECOVERY.

AND EVALUATION OF INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE POSSIBLE INDICATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF INVESTMENTS WITH GROSS UNREALIZED

INVESTMENT LOSSES THAT HAVE FAIR VALUES LESS THAN 80% OF COST FOR SIX

CONSECUTIVE MONTHS OR MORE;

·

REVIEW

OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

·

DETERMINATION

OF THE STATUS OF EACH ANALYZED INVESTMENT AS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY OR NOT, WITH

DOCUMENTATION OF THE RATIONALE FOR THE DECISION.

SALES OF TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INVESTED ASSETS

THE COMPANY MAY, FROM TIME

TO TIME, SELL INVESTED ASSETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE THAT WERE

CONSIDERED TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FOR

ALL SUBSEQUENT SALES OF INVESTED ASSETS THAT WERE CONSIDERED TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, THE COMPANY CONTEMPORANEOUSLY DOCUMENTS ITS

RATIONALE FOR ITS CHANGE IN INTENT OR ABILITY TO HOLD TO RECOVERY.  THE RATIONALE FOR THE CHANGE IN THE COMPANYS

ABILITY AND INTENT GENERALLY FOCUSES ON CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO THE INVESTED ASSET SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET

DATE, SIGNIFICANT UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY NEEDS, OR

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES

AN INVESTMENT IN A FIXED

MATURITY OR EQUITY SECURITY WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR SALE IS IMPAIRED IF ITS FAIR

VALUE FALLS BELOW ITS COST OR NEW COST BASIS AND THE DECLINE IS CONSIDERED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. A FIXED MATURITY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SECURITYS CONTRACTUAL TERMS OR WHERE THE COMPANY DOES

NOT HAVE THE INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY. EQUITY SECURITIES ARE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED WHEN IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT THE COMPANY WILL

NOT RECOVER ITS COST OVER THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD. FURTHER, FOR SECURITIES

EXPECTED TO BE SOLD, AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IF

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY TO RECOVER PRIOR TO

THE EXPECTED DATE OF SALE. ADDITIONALLY, FOR CERTAIN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL

ASSETS WITH CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS (INCLUDING ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), THE

COMPANY PERIODICALLY UPDATES ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF CASH FLOWS OVER THE LIFE OF

THE SECURITY. IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITIZED

FINANCIAL ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND THERE HAS BEEN A DECREASE

IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS SINCE THE LAST REVISED

ESTIMATE, CONSIDERING BOTH TIMING AND AMOUNT, THEN AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

THE CARRYING VALUE OF A

REAL ESTATE PROPERTY IS REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE

REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY.

AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. THE

IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS MEASURED AS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS

FAIR VALUE.

MORTGAGE LOANS

A MORTGAGE LOAN IS

CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO

COLLECT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST AMOUNTS DUE. FOR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT ARE

DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED, A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE AMORTIZED COST AND FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. IN

ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATES REFLECTING THE CURRENT

REAL ESTATE FINANCING MARKET RETURNS. IMPAIRED LOANS WERE NOT MATERIAL AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005.

VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS

VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT BY THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER AND THE COMPANYS

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

RECOVER ALL OF THE COST OF AN INDIVIDUAL HOLDING. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION,

PLEASE SEE THE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS SECTIONS UNDER THE VALUATION OF

INVESTMENTS ABOVE.

NET INVESTMENT

INCOME

INVESTMENT INCOME FROM FIXED MATURITIES AND MORTGAGE

LOANS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONSTANT EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD INCLUDING

ESTIMATED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS, IF ANY. THE EFFECTIVE YIELD USED TO DETERMINE

AMORTIZATION FOR FIXED MATURITIES SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK (E.G.,

ASSET-BACKED, LOAN-BACKED AND STRUCTURED SECURITIES) IS RECALCULATED AND

ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY BASED UPON ACTUAL HISTORICAL AND/OR PROJECTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS, WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM A WIDELY-ACCEPTED SECURITIES DATA PROVIDER. THE

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE YIELD FOR HIGHLY RATED PREPAYABLE FIXED MATURITIES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE YIELD FOR

NON-HIGHLY RATED PREPAYABLE FIXED MATURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE

PROSPECTIVE METHOD.  DIVIDENDS ON EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME WHEN DECLARED. RENTAL INCOME ON REAL ESTATE

IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. SEE NOTE 3 FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION. UNDISTRIBUTED INCOME FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IS

REPORTED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME.

ACCRUAL OF INCOME IS

SUSPENDED ON FIXED MATURITIES OR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT ARE IN DEFAULT, OR ON

WHICH IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AS SCHEDULED. INTEREST

INCOME ON INVESTMENTS IN DEFAULT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY AS PAYMENT IS RECEIVED.

INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET THAT WERE NOT INCOME-PRODUCING

FOR THE PRECEDING 12 MONTHS WERE NOT MATERIAL.

INVESTMENT GAINS

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT

GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF PRETAX REVENUES BASED UPON

RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ONGOING REVIEW OF

AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT

STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. AMOUNTS

DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE, INCLUDING AMOUNTS DUE FROM KNOWN INSOLVENT

REINSURERS, ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. ANY SUBSEQUENT COLLECTIONS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY

WRITTEN OFF ARE REPORTED AS PART OF CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. THE

COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER

VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT

LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES.

DEFERRED

ACQUISITION COSTS

AMOUNTS WHICH VARY WITH

AND ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION OF NEW INSURANCE CONTRACTS,

PRIMARILY COMMISSIONS AND PREMIUM-RELATED TAXES, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED PRO

RATA OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS IN WHICH THE RELATED PREMIUMS ARE EARNED.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS ARE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE RECOVERABLE

FROM FUTURE INCOME AND, IF NOT, ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. FUTURE INVESTMENT

INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RELATED PREMIUMS IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MEASURING THE

RECOVERABILITY OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THIS ASSET. ALL OTHER ACQUISITION EXPENSES

ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED.

CONTRACTHOLDER

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

UNDER CERTAIN WORKERS

COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS

OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS

SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE POLICYHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. THESE

AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN

CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES AND CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

A REVIEW IS PERFORMED ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, OF

GOODWILL HELD BY THE REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE THE COMPANYS THREE OPERATING

AND REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: BUSINESS INSURANCE; FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL &

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE; AND PERSONAL INSURANCE.

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST

STEP IS TO IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT USING A MULTIPLE-OF-EARNINGS

APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS. THE FAIR VALUES OF

THE REPORTING UNITS ARE THEN COMPARED TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING

GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEED THEIR FAIR

VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THAT ARE NOT DEEMED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

USEFUL LIVES. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT DEEMED TO

HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE IS REGULARLY REVIEWED FOR INDICATORS OF

IMPAIRMENTS IN VALUE. IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF

THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE FROM ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND IS

MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE ASSET.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM

RESERVES DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE

LIABILITIES FOR LOSSES FOR SOME LONG-TERM DISABILITY PAYMENTS UNDER WORKERS

COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE, WHICH

TOTALED $1.98 BILLION AND $1.92 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND

2005. RESERVES RELATED TO CERTAIN FIXED AND DETERMINABLE ASBESTOS-RELATED

SETTLEMENTS, WHERE ALL PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND THEIR TIMING ARE KNOWN, TOTALED $34

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 2.6% AT

THAT DATE. THERE WERE NO SUCH RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. RESERVES FOR

CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 7% AND A

RANGE OF RATES FROM 5% TO 7.5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, AND TOTALED $37 MILLION AND $79 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

IN DETERMINING CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, THE COMPANY PERFORMS A CONTINUING REVIEW OF

ITS OVERALL POSITION, ITS RESERVING TECHNIQUES AND ITS REINSURANCE. THE

RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE

COMPANY. THESE RESERVES REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE COST OF ALL INCURRED

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. SINCE THE RESERVES ARE BASED ON

ESTIMATES, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN SUCH RESERVES. THE

EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATED RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. SUCH CHANGES MAY

BE MATERIAL TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD

OCCUR IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

SECURITIES LENDING

THE COMPANY ENGAGES IN

SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES NET INVESTMENT INCOME

FROM THE LENDING OF CERTAIN OF ITS INVESTMENTS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT

PERIODS OF TIME. BORROWERS OF THESE SECURITIES PROVIDE COLLATERAL EQUAL TO AT

LEAST 102% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST.

THIS COLLATERAL IS HELD BY A THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN, AND THE COMPANY HAS THE

RIGHT TO ACCESS THE COLLATERAL ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THE INSTITUTION BORROWING

THE COMPANYS SECURITIES IS IN DEFAULT UNDER THE LENDING AGREEMENT. THEREFORE,

THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RECEIPT OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE

THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN OR THE OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE COLLATERAL. THE LOANED

SECURITIES REMAIN A RECORDED ASSET OF THE COMPANY.

OTHER LIABILITIES

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET IS THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITY FOR GUARANTY FUND AND

OTHER INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. THE LIABILITY FOR EXPECTED STATE GUARANTY

FUND AND OTHER PREMIUM-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE COMPANY WRITES OR

BECOMES OBLIGATED TO WRITE OR RENEW THE PREMIUMS ON WHICH THE ASSESSMENTS ARE

EXPECTED TO BE BASED. THE LIABILITY FOR LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS

THE RELATED LOSSES ARE INCURRED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE

COMPANY HAD A LIABILITY OF $263 MILLION AND $278 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR

GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS AND RELATED RECOVERABLES OF $11 MILLION AND

MISCELLANEOUS REVENUES.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND TAX

RETURN BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, BASED ON ENACTED TAX RATES AND OTHER

PROVISIONS OF THE TAX LAW. THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN TAX LAWS OR RATES ON

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN

OR LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS ARE THEN

TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE CHANGE IN UNREALIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION GAIN OR LOSS DURING THE YEAR, NET OF TAX, IS A COMPONENT OF

SUMMARY OF

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE

COMPENSATION PLAN THAT PERMITS GRANTS OF NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, INCENTIVE

STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK,

STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED OR STOCK-DENOMINATED

AWARDS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

THE STOCK-BASED AWARDS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON

THE DATE OF GRANT. STOCK OPTION FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED BY APPLICATION OF AN

OPTION PRICING MODEL, WHILE RESTRICTED STOCK AND DEFERRED STOCK FAIR VALUE IS

MEASURED AT THE MARKET PRICE OF A SHARE ON THE GRANT DATE.

THE COMPENSATION COST FOR

AWARDS SUBJECT TO A SERVICE CONDITION IS BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD IS EXPECTED TO BE RENDERED.

AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREE-ELIGIBLE OR TO EMPLOYEES THAT BECOME RETIREE-ELIGIBLE

BEFORE AN AWARDS VESTING DATE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE MET THE REQUISITE SERVICE

CONDITION. THE COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A PERFORMANCE CONDITION

IS BASED UPON THE PROBABLE OUTCOME THAT THE PERFORMANCE CONDITION WILL BE

ACHIEVED. THE COMPENSATION COST REFLECTS AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL FORFEITURE RATE OF

5% OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARDS. THAT ESTIMATE IS REVISED IF

SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS EXPECTED

TO VEST IS LIKELY TO DIFFER FROM PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. COMPENSATION COST FOR

AWARDS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE

PERIOD. FOR AWARDS THAT HAVE A GRADED VESTING SCHEDULE, THE COMPENSATION COST

IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD FOR

EACH SEPARATE VESTING PORTION OF THE AWARD AS IF THE AWARD WAS, IN SUBSTANCE,

MULTIPLE AWARDS.

DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY MAY USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EQUITY SWAPS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, OPTIONS,

FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL FUTURES, AS A MEANS OF HEDGING EXPOSURE TO

INTEREST RATE, EQUITY PRICE CHANGE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. THE COMPANYS

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING

PURPOSES. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES ALL DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS, AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND MEASURES THOSE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE. WHERE

APPLICABLE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS USED TO ACCOUNT FOR DERIVATIVES. FOR AN

INSTRUMENT TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE, THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP MUST BE DESIGNATED AND

FORMALLY DOCUMENTED AT INCEPTION, DETAILING THE PARTICULAR RISK MANAGEMENT

OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR THE HEDGE, INCLUDING THE ITEM AND RISK THAT IS BEING

HEDGED, THE DERIVATIVE THAT IS BEING USED, AND HOW EFFECTIVENESS IS BEING

ASSESSED. A DERIVATIVE MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN ACCOMPLISHING THE OBJECTIVE

OF OFFSETTING EITHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS IS EVALUATED ON A

RETROSPECTIVE AND PROSPECTIVE BASIS USING QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF CORRELATION.

IF A HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS FOUND TO BE INEFFECTIVE, IT NO LONGER QUALIFIES AS A

HEDGE, AND ANY EXCESS GAINS OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH INEFFECTIVENESS AS

WELL AS SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE RECOGNITION OF GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFY AS A HEDGE DEPENDS UPON

WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE, A CASH FLOW HEDGE OR A

FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE.

DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT

QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH THE CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN NET REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

2. SEGMENT INFORMATION

THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED INTO THREE REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS: BUSINESS INSURANCE; FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL &

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE; AND PERSONAL INSURANCE. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED

TO GENERATE THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT DATA ARE THE SAME AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1. THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS

IN EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES AND TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED

ASSETS OTHER THAN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WERE NOT MATERIAL.

THE COMPANY ALLOCATES INVESTED ASSETS AND THE RELATED

NET INVESTMENT INCOME (NII) TO ITS REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. PRETAX NET

INVESTMENT INCOME IS ALLOCATED BASED UPON AN INVESTABLE FUNDS CONCEPT, WHICH

TAKES INTO ACCOUNT LIABILITIES (NET OF NON-INVESTED ASSETS) AND APPROPRIATE

CAPITAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EACH SEGMENT. THE INVESTMENT YIELD FOR INVESTABLE

FUNDS REFLECTS THE DURATION OF THE LOSS RESERVES FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME THE LOSSES WERE INCURRED AND A+ RATED

CORPORATE DEBT INSTRUMENT YIELDS. THE INVESTMENT YIELD FOR CAPITAL REFLECTS THE

AVERAGE YIELD ON THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. IT IS THE APPLICATION OF THE

YIELDS TO THE SEGMENTS INVESTABLE FUNDS AND CAPITAL THAT DETERMINES THE

RESPECTIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS SHARE OF ACTUAL NII.

THE COST OF THE COMPANYS CATASTROPHE TREATY PROGRAM

IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS CEDED PREMIUMS AND IS ALLOCATED AMONG REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF ACTUAL MARKET REINSURANCE PRICING

USING EXPECTED LOSSES CALCULATED BY THE COMPANYS CATASTROPHE MODEL, ADJUSTED

FOR ANY EXPERIENCE ADJUSTMENTS. FOR HURRICANE KATRINA IN 2005, THE INITIAL

ALLOCATION OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES TO THE SEGMENTS WAS BASED UPON THE BEST

ESTIMATE OF SEGMENT INCURRED LOSSES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE THE COMPONENTS OF THE

COMPANYS REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AND TOTAL ASSETS BY REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FINANCIAL DATA FOR PRIOR YEARS PRESENTED IN THE TABLES WAS

RECLASSIFIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW SEGMENT STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTED IN

2006.

4. REINSURANCE

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF ASSUMED AND CEDED REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. ASSUMED

REINSURANCE REFERS TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS THAT OTHER

INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN. CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES TRANSFERRING

CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS (ALONG WITH THE RELATED WRITTEN AND EARNED PREMIUMS)

THE COMPANY HAS UNDERWRITTEN TO OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO AGREE TO SHARE

THESE RISKS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF CEDED REINSURANCE IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY,

AT A COST, FROM VOLATILITY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT IT IS PREPARED TO ACCEPT.

REINSURANCE IS PLACED ON BOTH A QUOTA-SHARE AND EXCESS OF LOSS BASIS. CEDED

REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT DISCHARGE THE COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY INSURER,

EXCEPT FOR CASES INVOLVING A NOVATION.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO

MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. IN

ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY BECOME INVOLVED

IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT

IN LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO DETERMINE

THE COMPANYS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS.

THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE

COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS

INVOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS THROUGH ASSUMED REINSURANCE, PRINCIPALLY

WITH REGARD TO RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS IN WORKERS COMPENSATION. THE COMPANY

PROVIDES SERVICES FOR SEVERAL OF THESE INVOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS (MANDATORY

POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS) UNDER WHICH IT WRITES SUCH RESIDUAL MARKET BUSINESS

DIRECTLY, THEN CEDES 100% OF THIS BUSINESS TO THE MANDATORY POOL. SUCH

SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ARRANGED TO PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM ANY CREDIT

RISK, AS ANY CEDED BALANCES ARE JOINTLY BACKED BY ALL THE POOL MEMBERS.

THE COMPANY ASSUMED 100% OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION

PREMIUMS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN BY THE ACCIDENT DEPARTMENT OF ITS FORMER AFFILIATE,

THE TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY.

CERTAIN OF THE ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS THAT THE

COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO WITH NON-AFFILIATED COMPANIES ON AN EXCESS OF LOSS

BASIS DO NOT TRANSFER INSURANCE RISK. THESE CONTRACTS, WHICH TOTALED

THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERED INTO A NEW REINSURANCE AGREEMENT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1,

2004, THAT PROVIDES $300 MILLION AGGREGATE COVERAGE FOR THE 2000 ACCIDENT

YEAR EXPOSURES WRITTEN BY SPC. BECAUSE THE NEW AGREEMENT IS FOR EVENTS

OCCURRING PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT, IT WAS CONSIDERED

RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE AND THE RESULTING $59 MILLION GAIN WAS DEFERRED AND

WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS AMOUNTS ARE RECOVERED FROM THE REINSURER. THROUGH

TERRORISM RISK

INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 AND TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, THE TERRORISM RISK

INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 (THE TERRORISM ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW AND

ESTABLISHED THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM), A TEMPORARY

FEDERAL PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THAT PROVIDED FOR A SYSTEM

OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM

ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN INTEREST. THE

PROGRAM WAS SCHEDULED TO TERMINATE ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005,

THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005 (THE TERRORISM EXTENSION

ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW, REAUTHORIZING THE PROGRAM THROUGH DECEMBER 31,

2007, WHILE REDUCING THE FEDERAL ROLE UNDER THE PROGRAM.

IN ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM

(SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS

THAT VARY BY PROGRAM YEAR OF AMOUNTS $100 MILLION OR LESS, AND MUST BE THE RESULT

OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF

THE TREASURY. THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION CERTAIN OF THE

FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE: FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE, PRIVATE MORTGAGE

INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE, HEALTH

OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD INSURANCE, AND REINSURANCE. THE TERRORISM EXTENSION

ACT EXEMPTED FROM COVERAGE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL TYPES OF INSURANCE, INCLUDING

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY (OTHER THAN DIRECTORS AND

OFFICERS), SURETY, BURGLARY AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS MULTI-PERIL. IN THE

CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE

COVERED BY THE TERRORISM ACT AND THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT. BOTH ACTS

GENERALLY REQUIRE THAT ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN

THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A

PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

FOR A PERCENTAGE OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN

ANNUAL CAP. THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT PERCENTAGE IS 85% IN 2007.

THE DEDUCTIBLE IS

CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE DEDUCTIBLE PERCENTAGE TO THE INSURERS DIRECT EARNED

PREMIUMS FOR COVERED LINES FROM THE CALENDAR YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE

APPLICABLE YEAR. THE DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM WAS 10% FOR 2004, 15% FOR

2005, 17.5% FOR 2006 AND WILL BE 20% FOR 2007. THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED

DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS $2.20 BILLION FOR 2007. THE ANNUAL CAP LIMITS

THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100

BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE $100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A

PROGRAM YEAR, CONGRESS SHALL DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF FUNDS, IF ANY, AVAILABLE

FOR LOSSES THAT EXCEED THE $100 BILLION CAP. THE COMPANY HAD NO

TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES IN 2006, 2005 OR 2004. IF THE PROGRAM IS NOT RENEWED

FOR PERIODS AFTER JANUARY 1, 2008, THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM WILL NOT BE

AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO LOSSES FROM ACTS

OF TERRORISM SUBJECT ONLY TO THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE POLICIES,

INCLUDING POLICIES WRITTEN IN 2007 FOR WHICH THE PERIOD OF COVERAGE EXTENDS

INTO 2008. GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM LOSSES,

AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN THE COMPANYS OWN REINSURANCE

PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVING

NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE

PERIODS, PARTICULARLY IF THE PROGRAM IS NOT EXTENDED. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE

TERRORISM ACT IS EXTENDED, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THIS TYPE OF

CATASTROPHIC RISK BY MONITORING AND CONTROLLING TERRORISM RISK AGGREGATIONS TO

THE BEST OF ITS ABILITY.

THE FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT OF $191 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN 2004

AND WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF NOMINAL CLAIM AND CLAIM EXPENSE

RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES (AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFORMITY WITH THE

ACQUIRERS ACCOUNTING POLICY ON DISCOUNTING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION RESERVES),

EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERNS, THE APRIL 1, 2004 U.S. TREASURY SPOT RATE YIELD

CURVE, A LEVERAGE RATIO ASSUMPTION (RESERVES TO STATUTORY SURPLUS), AND A COST

OF CAPITAL EXPRESSED AS A SPREAD OVER RISK-FREE RATES. THE METHOD USED

CALCULATES A RISK ADJUSTMENT TO A RISK-FREE DISCOUNTED RESERVE THAT WILL, IF

RESERVES RUN OFF AS EXPECTED, PRODUCE RESULTS THAT YIELD THE ASSUMED

COST-OF-CAPITAL ON THE CAPITAL SUPPORTING THE LOSS RESERVES. THE FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT IS REPORTED AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET, AND THE AMOUNTS MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACQUIRERS ACCOUNTING

POLICIES FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS PART OF THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE

RECOGNIZED INTO INCOME OVER THE EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERN. BECAUSE THE TIME

VALUE OF MONEY AND THE RISK ADJUSTMENT (COST OF CAPITAL) COMPONENTS OF THE

INTANGIBLE ASSET RUN OFF AT DIFFERENT RATES, THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN INCOME

MAY BE A NET BENEFIT IN SOME PERIODS AND A NET EXPENSE IN OTHER PERIODS.

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $739 MILLION IN 2004, WHICH

INCLUDED A $300 MILLION CHARGE TO STRENGTHEN SURETY RESERVES, AS WELL AS A $252

MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR AND $39 MILLION

RELATED TO THE COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER. RESULTS IN

2004 ALSO REFLECTED A CHARGE TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED

UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM A CO-SURETY ON A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION

CONTRACTOR CLAIM.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE.

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN 2004 WAS $378 MILLION. IN THE HOMEOWNERS LINE OF BUSINESS, THE

IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS,

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING HIGHER POLICY DEDUCTIBLE

LEVELS AND FEWER SMALL DOLLAR CLAIMS. THESE CHANGES RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN THE

HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN

EXPECTED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOCIETAL

TRENDS. IN ADDITION, BOTH INDUSTRY AND INTERNAL INITIATIVES TO FIGHT FRAUD IN

SEVERAL STATES CAUSED A DECREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS, AS WELL AS A

CHANGE IN THE HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS.

FOR EACH OF THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS BETWEEN

ACCIDENT YEARS OF LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, PURSUANT TO REGULATORY REPORTING

REQUIREMENTS, ARE INCLUDED IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS

ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS AND DID NOT IMPACT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ASBESTOS AND

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE COMPANYS

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INCLUDED $4.47 BILLION AND $4.79

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS, NET OF

REINSURANCE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS

AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS DUE TO THE VAGARIES OF COURT COVERAGE

DECISIONS, PLAINTIFFS EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, THE RISKS INHERENT IN

COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE

WHICH ARE SET FORTH BELOW.

ASBESTOS

RESERVES.

BECAUSE EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS

DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE

EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AT LEAST ANNUALLY ON A

POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS. IN THE COURSE OF THIS REVIEW, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE

ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE

POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF EACH POLICYHOLDERS

POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE

CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT VALUES

OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER

INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS

CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR

DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN

ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE

LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM. FOR THOSE

POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH AN ESTIMATE OF THE GROSS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR

INDEMNITY AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE IS DETERMINED, THE COMPANY

CALCULATES, BY EACH POLICY YEAR, A CEDED REINSURANCE PROJECTION BASED ON ANY

APPLICABLE FACULTATIVE AND TREATY REINSURANCE, PAST CEDED EXPERIENCE AND

REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO

ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES. THE COMPANYS EVALUATIONS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN ANY

DATA FROM WHICH A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY PAYMENT MAY

BE DETERMINED.

THE COMPANY ALSO COMPARES ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET

LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE, YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY EMERGING TRENDS,

FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. NET

ASBESTOS LOSSES AND EXPENSES PAID IN 2006 WERE $469 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $399

MILLION IN 2005. THE $70 MILLION NET INCREASE IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER

REINSURANCE BILLINGS IN 2006. APPROXIMATELY 50% IN 2006 AND 42% IN 2005 OF

TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES RELATE TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY

ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANYS LIABILITY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, NET ASBESTOS RESERVES TOTALED $4.05 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $4.36 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE COMPANY RECORDED PRE-TAX ASBESTOS RESERVE

ADDITIONS OF $155 MILLION, $830 MILLION AND $928 MILLION IN 2006, 2005 AND

2004, RESPECTIVELY, PURSUANT TO THE COMPLETION OF ITS ANNUAL GROUND-UP ASBESTOS

EXPOSURE REVIEW, WHICH INCLUDED AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT

PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF

THE $155 MILLION 2006 PRETAX RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE

PROJECTED DEFENSE COSTS FOR TEN POLICYHOLDERS. ADDITIONALLY, $15 MILLION OF THE

PRETAX RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DELAY IN THE APPROVAL AND

EXPECTED PAYMENT OF THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SETTLEMENT WITH PPG INDUSTRIES, INC.

AS PART OF THE PITTSBURGH CORNING BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN. THE REMAINDER

OF THE RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED LITIGATION ACTIVITY

AGAINST SMALLER, PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. THE ASBESTOS RESERVE ADDITION IN 2005

RESULTED, IN PART, FROM HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE COSTS DUE TO INCREASED

TRIAL ACTIVITY FOR SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED PLAINTIFFS AND PROLONGED LITIGATION

BEFORE CASES ARE SETTLED OR DISMISSED. THE 2005 RESERVE ADDITION ALSO

CONSIDERED THE JANUARY 2006 COURT DECISION

6. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)

VOIDING, ON PROCEDURAL

GROUNDS, THE PREVIOUSLY RENDERED FAVORABLE ARBITRATION DECISION IN THE ONGOING

ACANDS LITIGATION (DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 15). THE ASBESTOS RESERVE

ADDITION RECORDED IN 2004 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION

COSTS AND ACTIVITY SURROUNDING PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS.

AS IN PRIOR YEARS, THE 2006 ANNUAL REVIEW CONSIDERED

ACTIVE POLICYHOLDERS AND LITIGATION CASES, INCLUDING CASES CHALLENGING THE

APPLICABILITY OF AGGREGATE LIMITS ON ASBESTOS CLAIMS. DEVELOPING PAYMENT TRENDS

AMONG POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE AS WELL AS ASSUMED AND

INTERNATIONAL CATEGORIES WERE ALSO ANALYZED. THE 2006 REVIEW OF THE HOME OFFICE

AND FIELD OFFICE CATEGORIES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE NUMBER

OF POLICYHOLDERS, EXPERIENCED AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN NEW CLAIM FILINGS AS WELL

AS IN GROSS INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE PAYMENTS OVER PRIOR YEARS.

THE COMPANY HAS

RECENTLY OBSERVED THE FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT.

·

THE EMERGENCE OF MORE STABLE PAYMENT TRENDS

FOR A GREATER PROPORTION OF POLICYHOLDERS;

·

A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW CLAIMS

RECEIVED;

·

A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE ASBESTOS

EXPOSURES REFLECTING ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY;

·

A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER AND VOLATILITY OF

ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCIES; AND

·

THE ABSENCE OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR

NEW CLASSES OF DEFENDANTS.

WHILE THERE REMAINS UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE

EXPOSURE FROM ASBESTOS CLAIMS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FACTORS NOTED

ABOVE HAVE LED TO A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ITS

ASBESTOS EXPOSURE.

AS A RESULT OF THESE FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE ASBESTOS

ENVIRONMENT, AND IN PARTICULAR THE EMERGENCE OF MORE STABLE PAYMENT PATTERNS,

BEGINNING IN 2007 THE COMPANY IS NOW ABLE TO SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING ANNUAL

IN-DEPTH PROCESS AND THE EXISTING QUARTERLY ASBESTOS REVIEW PROCESS WITH

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATE QUARTERLY RESERVE ANALYSES. THESE ADDITIONAL ANALYSES WILL

PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH AN INCREASED ABILITY TO DETECT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING

TRENDS, INCLUDING REFLECTING ANY SUCH TRENDS IN ITS QUARTERLY RESERVE

ESTIMATES.

ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES.

IN ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND

THE ANTICIPATED COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF SIMILAR EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE

ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE ALLEGATIONS OF

ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM

AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT

ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE

OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE

POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE

COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE

POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF

COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL

NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN

EACH JURISDICTION. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE

THESE RESERVES.

191

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

6. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)

THE COMPANY HAS CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN

THE NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THESE

POLICYHOLDERS GENERALLY PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE

LOWER TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE UTILIZING RISK-BASED

ANALYSIS AND MORE EFFICIENT CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS

EXPERIENCED HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS. THESE INCREASES

HAVE BEEN DRIVEN IN PART BY ADVERSE JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN STATES

REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF COVERAGE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. AS A RESULT OF

THESE TRENDS, THE COMPANY INCREASED ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $120 MILLION IN

2006. IN 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $30 MILLION, PRIMARILY

FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT COSTS. IN 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE

OF $290 MILLION DUE TO REVISED ESTIMATES OF COSTS RELATED TO RECENT SETTLEMENT

INITIATIVES. THE INCREASES IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES IN EACH YEAR WERE NET OF

REINSURANCE. GROSS PAID LOSSES IN 2006 AND 2005 WERE $189 MILLION AND $248

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED

ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED

BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE

UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT

IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE

CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY

INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION

SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER

INCREASE OR DECREASE IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS

ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS

ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE

AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER

INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER

AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

PERTAINING TO THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE EXHAUSTION OR

UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY

AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER

DEFENDANTS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A RECENT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER AND

VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCIES. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT

CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE

AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN

APPLICABLE LEGISLATION, INCLUDING LEGISLATION RELATED TO ASBESTOS REFORM. IT IS

ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LARGE COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE

RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS

PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN

INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT

APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS

RESERVES, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANNUAL GROUND-UP REVIEW OF ASBESTOS POLICYHOLDERS,

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER

DEVELOPMENTS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS MOST RECENT ANNUAL GROUND-UP REVIEW

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006. SEE PART IITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

CATASTROPHE

EXPOSURE

THE COMPANY HAS GEOGRAPHIC EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE

LOSSES IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS

NATURAL AND MAN-MADE EVENTS INCLUDING HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES,

HAIL, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, EXPLOSIONS AND FIRES. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY

OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A

CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE

AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST CATASTROPHES ARE

RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS; HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY

PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE HEAVILY

POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES

THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE.

THERE ARE ALSO RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF

ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES.  FOR

EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY

THE INABILITY BY THE COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE

IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL

AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO

ESTABLISH THE RESERVES.  COMPLEX FACTORS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY

FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES;

ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE;

INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY.  THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHES OCCURRENCE,

SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD.  THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE

ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

$575 MILLION OF PREFERRED SECURITIES, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH, ALONG WITH $18

MILLION IN CAPITAL PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY, WERE USED TO PURCHASE THE

SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY. UPON THE COMPANYS REDEMPTION OF

ITS SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES IN NOVEMBER 2006, ST. PAUL CAPITAL TRUST I IN

TURN USED THE PROCEEDS TO REDEEM ITS PREFERRED SECURITIES. ST. PAUL CAPITAL

TRUST I WAS THEN LIQUIDATED, AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN $18 MILLION

DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL. THE COMPANY RECORDED A $42 MILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE

REDEMPTION OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES, REPRESENTING THE REMAINING

UNAMORTIZED FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT RECORDED AT THE MERGER DATE. THE GAIN WAS RECORDED

IN OTHER REVENUES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. ON NOVEMBER 15,

PERIOD, THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST DUE TO HOLDERS OF THE NOTES WILL CONTINUE TO

ACCUMULATE, AND SUCH DEFERRED INTEREST PAYMENTS WILL THEMSELVES ACCRUE

INTEREST. DEFERRAL OF ANY INTEREST CAN CREATE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS FOR THE

COMPANY. UNLESS PREVIOUSLY REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED, THE NOTES ARE CONVERTIBLE

INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDERS AT ANY TIME AFTER MARCH 27,

2003 AND PRIOR TO APRIL 15, 2032 IF AT ANY TIME (1) THE AVERAGE OF

HAVE OCCURRED. THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A

CONVERSION RATE OF 0.4684 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR EACH $25.00 PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT OF NOTES (EQUIVALENT TO AN INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF $53.37 PER SHARE

OF COMMON STOCK), SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IN CERTAIN EVENTS. ON OR AFTER APRIL 18,

2007, THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT THE COMPANYS OPTION. THE NOTES ARE GENERAL

UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND ARE SUBORDINATED IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ALL EXISTING

AND FUTURE SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS. THE NOTES ARE ALSO EFFECTIVELY SUBORDINATED TO

ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF ANY OF THE

COMPANYS CURRENT OR FUTURE SUBSIDIARIES. IF ALL NOTES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31,

LINE OF CREDIT

AGREEMENT

IN JUNE 2005, THE

COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $1.0 BILLION, FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH

A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT REPLACED AND

CONSOLIDATED THE COMPANYS THREE PRIOR BANK

CREDIT AGREEMENTS THAT HAD COLLECTIVELY PROVIDED THE COMPANY ACCESS TO $1.0

BILLION OF BANK CREDIT LINES. PURSUANT TO COVENANTS IN THE NEW CREDIT

AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN AN EXCESS OF CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OVER

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF NOT LESS THAN $10 BILLION AT ALL TIMES.

THE COMPANY MUST ALSO MAINTAIN A RATIO OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT TO THE

SUM OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT PLUS CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OF NOT GREATER THAN

0.40 TO 1.00. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS OTHER CUSTOMARY

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING

SHELF REGISTRATION

IN DECEMBER 2005, THE

COMPANY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT FOR THE POTENTIAL OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES. THE COMPANY MAY

OFFER THESE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE

AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

PREFERRED STOCK

THE COMPANYS PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

REPRESENTS THE PAR VALUE OF PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING THAT THE COMPANY

ASSUMED IN THE MERGER RELATED TO THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP) TRUST, LESS THE REMAINING PRINCIPAL BALANCE ON THE SOP

TRUST DEBT. THE SOP TRUST BORROWED FUNDS FROM A U.S. UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY TO

FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF THE PREFERRED SHARES, AND THE COMPANY GUARANTEED THE

SOP DEBT. THE FINAL PAYMENT ON THE SOP DEBT WAS MADE IN JANUARY 2005.

THE SOP TRUST MAY AT ANY TIME CONVERT ANY OR ALL OF

THE PREFERRED SHARES INTO SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT A RATE OF

EIGHT SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR EACH PREFERRED SHARE. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

HAS RESERVED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO SATISFY THE

CONVERSION OF ALL PREFERRED SHARES ISSUED TO THE SOP TRUST AND THE REDEMPTION

OF PREFERRED SHARES TO MEET EMPLOYEE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. UPON THE

REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES, THE COMPANY WILL ISSUE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

TO THE TRUST TO FULFILL THE REDEMPTION OBLIGATIONS. SEE NOTE 12. HOLDERS OF THE

PREFERRED STOCK HAVE A PREFERENCE UPON LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP

OF THE COMPANY OF $100 PER SHARE.

IN SEPTEMBER 2005,

THE SOP WAS MERGED INTO THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE

401(K) SAVINGS PLAN). SEE NOTE 12.

COMMON STOCK

THE COMPANY IS GOVERNED BY THE MINNESOTA BUSINESS

CORPORATION ACT. ALL AUTHORIZED SHARES OF VOTING COMMON STOCK HAVE NO PAR

VALUE. SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REACQUIRED ARE CONSIDERED AUTHORIZED AND UNISSUED

SHARES. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF THE COMPANY IS 1.75 BILLION. THE

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ISSUE FIVE MILLION UNDESIGNATED

SHARES. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DESIGNATE THE TYPE OF SHARES AND SET THE

TERMS THEREOF. THE BOARD DESIGNATED 1,450,000 SHARES AS SERIES B

ON FEBRUARY 6, 2007, THE COMPANY, UNDER THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, GRANTED 1,678,215

COMMON STOCK AWARDS IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK AND

PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS TO PARTICIPATING OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. THE

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS, TOTALING 1,097,720 SHARES,

GENERALLY VEST IN FULL AFTER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD FROM DATE OF GRANT. THE

PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS, TOTALING 580,495 TARGET SHARES, REPRESENT SHARES

WHICH THE RECIPIENT MAY EARN UPON THE COMPANYS ATTAINMENT OF CERTAIN

PERFORMANCE GOALS. THE PERFORMANCE GOALS ARE BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ADJUSTED

RETURN ON EQUITY OVER A THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. VESTING OF ANY

PERFORMANCE SHARES IS CONTINGENT UPON THE COMPANY ATTAINING THE RELEVANT

PERFORMANCE PERIOD MINIMUM THRESHOLD RETURN ON EQUITY. IF THE PERFORMANCE

PERIOD RETURN ON EQUITY IS BELOW THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD, NONE OF THE SHARES WILL

VEST; IF PERFORMANCE MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE

TREASURY STOCK

ON MAY 2, 2006, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $2 BILLION OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME

TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET, PURSUANT TO PRE-SET TRADING PLANS MEETING THE

REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 10B5-1 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

1934, IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A STATED

EXPIRATION DATE. THE TIMING AND ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED IN

THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF  FACTORS, INCLUDING CORPORATE AND

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, PRICE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS.

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 22.8 MILLION COMMON SHARES UNDER THE

PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $1.12 BILLION. THE AVERAGE COST PER

SHARE REPURCHASED IN 2006 WAS $49.20.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD $879

MILLION OF CAPACITY REMAINING UNDER THE ORIGINAL $2 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN 2006. IN JANUARY 2007, THE

COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $3 BILLION INCREASE TO THE PROGRAM.

THE COMPANYS 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE LEGACY SPC 1994

STOCK INCENTIVES PLAN AND THE LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN PROVIDE SETTLEMENT

ALTERNATIVES TO EMPLOYEES IN WHICH THE COMPANY REPURCHASES SHARES TO COVER TAX

WITHHOLDING COSTS AND EXERCISE COSTS. DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005, THE COMPANY PURCHASED $61 MILLION AND $33 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PLAN.

COMMON SHARES ACQUIRED ARE REPORTED AS TREASURY STOCK

IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT ANY OF ITS DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS WILL NOT RESULT IN FUTURE TAX BENEFITS, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE MUST BE

ESTABLISHED FOR THE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE

REALIZED. THE NET DECREASES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

WERE $16 MILLION AND $30 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, RELATING IN EACH YEAR TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS. BASED UPON A REVIEW

OF THE COMPANYS ANTICIPATED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND ALSO INCLUDING ALL

OTHER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT

CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL

BE REALIZED.

FOR TAX RETURN PURPOSES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

THE COMPANY HAD A U.S. NET OPERATING LOSS (NOL) CARRYFORWARD THAT EXPIRES, IF

UNUSED, IN 2017-2018. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REALIZING THE BENEFIT OF

NOL CARRYFORWARDS DEPENDS ON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY

TAX LAWS. THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF THOSE NOLS ON A REGULAR TAX BASIS AND AN

ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX (AMT) BASIS WERE $103 MILLION AND $70 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE BENEFIT OF THE NOL CARRYFORWARD HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANYS INTERCOMPANY TAX SHARING AGREEMENT WAS

AMENDED TO INCLUDE THE SPC COMPANIES EFFECTIVE WITH THEIR ACQUISITION ON APRIL 1,

2004.

U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON $245

MILLION OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, AS SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE

OPERATIONS. FURTHERMORE, ANY TAXES PAID TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ON THESE

EARNINGS MAY BE USED AS CREDITS AGAINST THE U.S. TAX ON ANY DIVIDEND

DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SUCH EARNINGS.

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT

(AJCA), WHICH PROVIDED A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. CORPORATIONS TO

85% DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY

REPATRIATED $158 MILLION OF CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EARNINGS INVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $8

11. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS A SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

PLAN, THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

(THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN), WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN JULY 2004 FOLLOWING THE

MERGER OF SPC AND TPC. THE PURPOSES OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN ARE TO REWARD

THE EFFORTS OF THE COMPANYS NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND

OTHER EMPLOYEES AND TO ATTRACT NEW PERSONNEL BY PROVIDING INCENTIVES IN THE

FORM OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN PERMITS GRANTS OF NONQUALIFIED

STOCK OPTIONS, INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED

STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK, STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED OR

STOCK-DENOMINATED AWARDS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THE NUMBER

OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZED FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2004

INCENTIVE PLAN IS 35 MILLION SHARES, SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT MAY BE

AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE

PLAN, THE LEGACY SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS OF TPC AND OF SPC WERE TERMINATED. OUTSTANDING

GRANTS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE TERMINATION OF THESE PLANS, INCLUDING THE GRANT

OF RELOAD OPTIONS RELATED TO PRIOR OPTION GRANTS UNDER THE LEGACY TPC AND THE

LEGACY SPC SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS.

THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN IS THE ONLY PLAN PURSUANT TO

WHICH FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED. IN ADDITION TO THE 35 MILLION

SHARES INITIALLY AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE

FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE COUNTED TOWARDS THE 35 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE AND WILL

BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN: (I) SHARES

OF COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO AN AWARD THAT EXPIRES UNEXERCISED, THAT IS

FORFEITED, TERMINATED OR CANCELED, THAT IS SETTLED IN CASH OR OTHER FORMS OF

PROPERTY, OR OTHERWISE DOES NOT RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK, IN WHOLE OR IN PART; (II) SHARES THAT ARE USED TO PAY THE EXERCISE

PRICE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SHARES USED TO PAY WITHHOLDING TAXES ON AWARDS

GENERALLY; AND (III) SHARES PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ON THE OPEN MARKET

USING CASH OPTION EXERCISE PROCEEDS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCREASE IN

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR GRANT PURSUANT TO SUCH

MARKET PURCHASES SHALL NOT BE GREATER THAN THE NUMBER THAT COULD BE REPURCHASED

AT FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF EXERCISE OF THE STOCK OPTION GIVING RISE TO

SUCH OPTION PROCEEDS. THESE PROVISIONS ALSO APPLY TO AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE

LEGACY TPC AND LEGACY SPC SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS THAT WERE

OUTSTANDING ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, EXCEPT FOR SHARES

DELIVERED TO OR RETAINED IN THE LEGACY TPC PLAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE

WITHHOLDING OF TAXES APPLICABLE TO THE EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS THAT

HAVE RELOAD FEATURES.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS A

COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS (THE 2004 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

PROGRAM). UNDER THE 2004 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

COMPENSATION CONSISTS OF AN ANNUAL RETAINER AND A DEFERRED STOCK AWARD. EACH

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR MAY CHOOSE TO RECEIVE ALL OR A PORTION OF HIS OR HER

ANNUAL RETAINER AND ANY COMMITTEE CHAIR OR CO-CHAIR FEES PAID IN THE FORM OF

CASH, COMMON STOCK OR DEFERRED STOCK. DEFERRED STOCK FOR THE ANNUAL RETAINER,

AND COMMITTEE CHAIR AND CO-CHAIR FEES, IS ELECTED PURSUANT TO THE ST. PAUL

IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR STOCK OPTION AWARDS

DESCRIBED ABOVE, CERTAIN STOCK OPTION AWARDS THAT WERE GRANTED UNDER THE LEGACY

OPTION TO BE GRANTED A NEW OPTION (A RELOAD OPTION) AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL

TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY PRECEDING THE

RELOAD GRANT. THE LEGACY TPC RELOAD OPTION IS PERMITTED ON THE STOCK OPTION

AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2003 AT AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF

SHARES OF THE COMMON STOCK USED TO SATISFY BOTH THE EXERCISE PRICE AND

WITHHOLDING TAXES DUE UPON EXERCISE OF AN OPTION AND VEST SIX MONTHS AFTER THE

GRANT DATE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED ORIGINAL

OPTION. THE LEGACY SPC RELOAD OPTION IS PERMITTED ON STOCK OPTION AWARDS

GRANTED BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2002 AND NOVEMBER 2003 IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMMON STOCK USED TO SATISFY BOTH THE EXERCISE

PRICE AND WITHHOLDING TAXES DUE UPON EXERCISE OF AN OPTION AND VEST ONE YEAR

AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED

ORIGINAL OPTION.

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH

OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT BY APPLICATION OF A VARIATION OF

THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL USING THE ASSUMPTIONS NOTED IN THE

FOLLOWING TABLE. THE EXPECTED TERM OF NEWLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS IS THE TIME

TO VEST PLUS HALF THE REMAINING TIME TO EXPIRATION. THIS CONSIDERS THE VESTING

RESTRICTION AND REPRESENTS AN EVEN PATTERN OF EXERCISE BEHAVIOR OVER THE

REMAINING TERM. RELOAD OPTIONS ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE ORIGINAL

OPTION AND THEREFORE WOULD

HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMMON STOCK OF AN INDUSTRY PEER GROUP OF

ENTITIES, DUE TO THE LIMITED COMPANY STOCK HISTORY, OVER THE ESTIMATED OPTION

TERM BASED ON THE MID-MONTH OF THE OPTION GRANT. THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND IS BASED

UPON THE COMPANYS CURRENT QUARTER DIVIDEND ANNUALIZED AND ASSUMED TO BE

CONSTANT OVER THE EXPECTED OPTION TERM. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE FOR EACH

OPTION IS THE INTERPOLATED MARKET YIELD FOR THE MID-MONTH OF THE OPTION GRANT

ON A U.S. TREASURY BILL WITH A TERM COMPARABLE TO THE EXPECTED OPTION TERM OF

THE GRANTED STOCK OPTION. SHARES RECEIVED THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES UNDER THE

RELOAD PROGRAM ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION ON SALE. A 10% DISCOUNT, AS MEASURED

BY THE ESTIMATED COST OF PROTECTION, HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF

RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD PROGRAMS

AWARDS OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND DEFERRED STOCK ARE MADE

TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN.

SUCH AWARDS INCLUDE RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS UNDER THE CAPITAL ACCUMULATION

PROGRAM (CAP) AND EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 2004

INCENTIVE PLAN. AWARDS ISSUED UNDER CAP ARE IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND

THE NUMBER OF SHARES INCLUDED IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD IS CALCULATED AT A

10% DISCOUNT FROM THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF THE AWARD AND GENERALLY VEST

IN FULL AFTER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. CAP HAS BEEN

DISCONTINUED FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF CAP AWARDS IN FEBRUARY 2006. OTHER

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS ISSUED UNDER THE EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM GENERALLY VEST

IN FULL AFTER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. EXCEPT UNDER LIMITED

CIRCUMSTANCES, DURING THIS PERIOD THE STOCK CANNOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY

THE PARTICIPANT, WHO IS REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE TO THE COMPANY DURING THE

RESTRICTED PERIOD. AWARDS GRANTED TO NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS ARE IN THE FORM OF

DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS. THESE DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS ARE GRANTED AT MARKET PRICE,

COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)

COMMENCING WITH EQUITY GRANTS ON OR AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY BEGAN TO GENERALLY GRANT RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS INSTEAD OF RESTRICTED STOCK. A RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT REPRESENTS THE RIGHT

TO RECEIVE A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS WILL BE

GRANTED AT MARKET PRICE, WILL GENERALLY VEST AFTER THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF

GRANT AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME CONDITIONS AS THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

EXCEPT THAT THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WILL NOT HAVE VOTING RIGHTS AND THE

COMMON STOCK WILL NOT BE ISSUED UNTIL THE VESTING CRITERIA ARE SATISFIED.

ON OCTOBER 25, 2005, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS APPROVED A PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS PROGRAM PURSUANT TO THE 2004

INCENTIVE PLAN. UNDER THE PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE BEGINNING IN 2006,

THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF THE

COMPANY WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF VICE PRESIDENT (OR ITS EQUIVALENT) OR ABOVE. THE

PERFORMANCE AWARDS REPRESENT TARGET SHARES THAT PROVIDE THE RECIPIENT THE RIGHT

TO EARN SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BASED UPON THE COMPANYS

ATTAINMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE GOALS. THE PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR PERFORMANCE

AWARDS GRANTED IN 2006 ARE BASED ON THE COMPANYS ADJUSTED RETURN ON EQUITY

OVER A THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. VESTING OF ANY PERFORMANCE SHARES IS

CONTINGENT UPON THE COMPANY ATTAINING THE RELEVANT PERFORMANCE PERIOD MINIMUM

THRESHOLD RETURN ON EQUITY. IF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD RETURN ON EQUITY IS BELOW

THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD, NONE OF THE SHARES WILL VEST; IF PERFORMANCE MEETS OR

EXCEEDS THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE THRESHOLD, BETWEEN 50%-160% OF THE

PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL VEST, DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL RETURN ON EQUITY

ATTAINED.

THE FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK AND

PERFORMANCE SHARES IS MEASURED AT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY STOCK AT DATE

OF GRANT.

THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF SHARES THAT VESTED DURING THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS $59 MILLION.

SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION RECOGNITION

THE COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A SERVICE

CONDITION IS BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH THE

REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD IS EXPECTED TO BE RENDERED. AWARDS GRANTED TO

RETIREE-ELIGIBLE OR TO EMPLOYEES THAT BECOME RETIREE-ELIGIBLE BEFORE AN AWARDS

VESTING DATE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE MET THE REQUISITE SERVICE CONDITION. THE

COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A PERFORMANCE CONDITION IS BASED UPON

THE PROBABLE OUTCOME THAT THE PERFORMANCE CONDITION WILL BE ACHIEVED. THE

COMPENSATION COST REFLECTS AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL FORFEITURE RATE OF 5% OVER THE

REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARDS. THAT ESTIMATE IS REVISED IF SUBSEQUENT

INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS EXPECTED TO VEST IS

LIKELY TO DIFFER FROM PREVIOUS ESTIMATES.  COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS ARE RECOGNIZED ON

A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. FOR AWARDS THAT HAVE A

GRADED VESTING SCHEDULE, THE COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD FOR EACH SEPARATE VESTING PORTION OF

THE AWARD AS IF THE AWARD WAS, IN SUBSTANCE, MULTIPLE AWARDS. THE TOTAL

COMPENSATION COST FOR ALL SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS RECOGNIZED

IN EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS $147 MILLION.

INCLUDED IN THAT AMOUNT WAS APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION OF COMPENSATION

COSTS RELATED TO AWARDS GRANTED, PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, TO

RETIREE-ELIGIBLE OR TO EMPLOYEES THAT BECAME RETIREE-ELIGIBLE BEFORE THE AWARDS

VESTING DATE. THE RELATED TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WERE $51 MILLION

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE WAS $125 MILLION

OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO ALL NONVESTED SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE

COMPENSATION AWARDS. THIS INCLUDES STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, DEFERRED

STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANYS 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN

AND LEGACY TPC AND LEGACY SPC SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS. THE

UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.7 YEARS.

UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, THE COMPANY HAD $9 MILLION

OF UNRECOGNIZED PRETAX COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO THE PORTION OF AWARDS

GRANTED PRIOR TO THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF FAS 123 (JANUARY 1, 2003) WHICH

REMAINED UNVESTED AND OUTSTANDING. THESE COMPENSATION COSTS ARE BEING

RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE REMAINING REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY

FIFTEEN MONTHS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION

OF REMAINING UNRECOGNIZED PRETAX COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO THESE AWARDS.

THE REQUIREMENT TO REPORT UNEARNED COMPENSATION AS

CONTRA-EQUITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WAS ELIMINATED BY FAS 123R. ACCORDINGLY,

THE COMPANYS UNEARNED COMPENSATION BALANCES WERE RECLASSIFIED TO COMMON STOCK

FOR ALL YEARS PRESENTED.

CASH RECEIVED FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS UNDER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS TOTALED $216 MILLION IN 2006. THE

TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FOR TAX DEDUCTIONS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES

TOTALED $28 MILLION FOR 2006.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION USED TO DETERMINE THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION IS BASED ON THE MOODYS AA CORPORATE BOND INDEX ADJUSTED BY

25 BASIS POINTS TO REFLECT THE LONG DURATION NATURE OF THE PENSION OBLIGATION

AND ADJUSTED TO THE NEAREST QUARTER RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE IS THEN BACK-TESTED

BY COMPARISON TO A YIELD CURVE THAT REFLECTS THE HYPOTHETICAL PORTFOLIO OF HIGH

QUALITY BONDS (RATED AA OR HIGHER BY A RECOGNIZED RATING AGENCY) FOR WHICH THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH OUTFLOWS APPROXIMATES THE ESTIMATED PAYOUTS OF THE

PLAN.

IN CHOOSING THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN, THE

COMPANYS PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL RETURNS

OF EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME MARKETS IN CONJUNCTION WITH TODAYS ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

AS AN INDICATOR OF

SENSITIVITY, INCREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY 1% WOULD

HAVE INCREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $29 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST

COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006. DECREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND

RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 BY $28 MILLION AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE

SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY

$2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006.

SAVINGS PLAN

THE COMPANY, IN SEPTEMBER 2005,

MERGED THE TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC.

SAVINGS PLUS PLAN (SPP), AND THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. STOCK OWNERSHIP

PLAN (SOP) INTO ONE NEW PLAN, THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN

(THE SAVINGS PLAN). SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMPANY EMPLOYEES ARE ELIGIBLE TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SAVINGS PLAN. IN 2006 AND 2005, THE COMPANY MATCHED EMPLOYEE

CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 5% OF ELIGIBLE PAY, WITH A MAXIMUM ANNUAL MATCH OF $5,000

WHICH BECOMES 100% VESTED AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE. THE COMPANY MATCH

CONTRIBUTED TO ACCOUNTS THROUGH 2006 WAS PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK. BEGINNING WITH THE 2006 MATCH THAT WAS CONTRIBUTED IN 2007, THE

COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTION IS MADE IN CASH AND INVESTED ACCORDING TO THE

EMPLOYEES CURRENT INVESTMENT ELECTIONS. THE COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTION CAN

BE REINVESTED AT ANY TIME INTO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT OPTION. THE EXPENSE RELATED

TO THIS PLAN WAS $69 MILLION AND $63 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

LEGACY TPC 401(K) SAVINGS

PLAN

PRIOR TO THE SEPTEMBER 2005

PLAN MERGER, THE COMPANY HAD A 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN UNDER WHICH

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL LEGACY TPC EMPLOYEES AND COMPANY EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER APRIL 1,

2004, WERE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN 2004, THE COMPANY MATCHED EMPLOYEE

CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 5% OF ELIGIBLE PAY BUT NOT MORE THAN $2,500 ANNUALLY. PRIOR

TO 2004, THE COMPANY MATCHED EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 3% OF ELIGIBLE PAY

BUT NOT MORE THAN $1,500 ANNUALLY. THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THIS PLAN WAS $34

MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004.

LEGACY SPC 401(K) SAVINGS

PLUS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

PRIOR

TO THE SEPTEMBER 2005

PLAN MERGER AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER WITH SPC, THE COMPANY ASSUMED THE

ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. SAVINGS PLUS PLAN (SPP), A 401(K) SAVINGS

PLAN AND THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP).

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES WHO WERE HIRED BY LEGACY SPC BEFORE APRIL 1,

2004 WERE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PLANS. IN 2004 UNDER THE SPP, THE

COMPANY MATCHED 100% OF EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 6% OF THEIR

SALARY. THE MATCH WAS IN THE FORM OF PREFERRED SHARES, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE

IN THE SOP, OR IN THE COMPANYS COMMON SHARES. ALSO ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS

WERE PREFERRED SHARES EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF DIVIDENDS ON PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED

SHARES.

TO FINANCE THE PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE FOR FUTURE

ALLOCATION TO QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, THE SOP BORROWED $150 MILLION AT 9.4% FROM A

PRIMARY U.S. UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY. AS THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OF THE

TRUSTS LOAN WAS PAID, A PRO RATA AMOUNT OF PREFERRED STOCK WAS RELEASED FOR

ALLOCATION TO PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES. EACH SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK PAYS A

DIVIDEND OF $11.72 ANNUALLY AND IS CURRENTLY CONVERTIBLE INTO EIGHT SHARES OF

THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS ON ALL SHARES HELD BY THE

TRUST WERE USED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE SOP OBLIGATION. IN ADDITION TO

DIVIDENDS PAID TO THE TRUST, ADDITIONAL CASH CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MADE TO THE SOP

AS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET THE SOPS DEBT OBLIGATION. THE SOPS DEBT

OBLIGATION WAS PAID OFF IN JANUARY 2005 WITH A FINAL PAYMENT OF $5

MILLION; CONSEQUENTLY, ALL PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS ARE NOW PAID TO PREFERRED

STOCKHOLDERS. THE SOP ALLOCATED THE FINAL 71,346 PREFERRED SHARES IN 2004. THE

SOP HAS NO PREFERRED SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE ALLOCATIONS.

ALL COMMON SHARES AND THE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENT OF

ALL PREFERRED SHARES HELD BY THE SOP ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR DILUTED EPS

COMPUTATIONS AND DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALL SHARES ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE

PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF POSITION 76-3, ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR

CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS IN

ACCOUNTING FOR THIS PLAN. THE COMPANY RECORDED AN EXPENSE OF $5 MILLION IN

2004.

THE FOLLOWING SECTION

DESCRIBES THE MAJOR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE

LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS, TO WHICH THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES IS A PARTY OR TO WHICH ANY OF THE COMPANYS PROPERTY IS SUBJECT.

ASBESTOS- AND

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED PROCEEDINGS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE

COMPANY RECEIVES CLAIMS FOR INSURANCE ARISING UNDER POLICIES ISSUED BY THE

COMPANY ASSERTING ALLEGED INJURIES AND DAMAGES FROM ASBESTOS, HAZARDOUS WASTE

AND OTHER TOXIC SUBSTANCES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION,

INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LITIGATION DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY CONTINUES

TO BE SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED LITIGATION. THE CONDITIONS

SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE RELATED LITIGATION

CONTINUE TO CHANGE.

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) IS INVOLVED IN

THREE SIGNIFICANT PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING) RELATING TO

ACANDS, INC. (ACANDS), FORMERLY A NATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR AND INSTALLER OF

PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS. THE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE DISPUTES AS TO WHETHER

AND TO WHAT EXTENT ANY OF ACANDS POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR CURRENT OR FUTURE

BODILY INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. THE

STATUS OF THE VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS IS DESCRIBED BELOW.

ACANDS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN SEPTEMBER 2002 (

IN RE: ACANDS, INC.,

PENDING IN THE

U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE). IN ITS PROPOSED PLAN OF

REORGANIZATION, ACANDS SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A TRUST TO PAY ASBESTOS BODILY

INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST IT AND SOUGHT TO ASSIGN TO THE TRUST ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE

INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. THE PROPOSED PLAN AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

FILED BY ACANDS CLAIMED THAT ACANDS HAD SETTLED THE VAST MAJORITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED

BODILY INJURY CLAIMS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT FOR APPROXIMATELY $2.80

BILLION. ACANDS ASSERTS THAT, BASED ON A PRIOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN TPC AND ACANDS

AND ACANDS INTERPRETATION OF THE JULY 31, 2003 ARBITRATION PANEL RULING

DESCRIBED BELOW, TPC IS LIABLE FOR 45% OF THE $2.80 BILLION. ON JANUARY 26,

2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ISSUED A DECISION REJECTING CONFIRMATION OF ACANDS

PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. THE BANKRUPTCY COURT FOUND, CONSISTENT WITH

TPCS OBJECTIONS TO ACANDS PROPOSED PLAN, THAT THE PROPOSED PLAN WAS NOT

FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR, WAS NOT PROPOSED IN GOOD FAITH AND DID NOT COMPLY WITH SECTION 524(G) OF

THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. ACANDS HAS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL OF THE BANKRUPTCY

COURTS DECISION AND HAS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS FINDINGS OF

FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT. TPC HAS MOVED

TO DISMISS THE APPEAL AND OBJECTIONS AND HAS ALSO FILED AN OPPOSITION TO ACANDS

OBJECTIONS.

AN ARBITRATION WAS COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2001 TO

DETERMINE WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT ACANDS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR BODILY

INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INSURANCE POLICY AGGREGATE LIMITS. ON JULY 31,

2003, THE ARBITRATION PANEL RULED IN FAVOR OF TPC THAT ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY

CLAIMS AGAINST ACANDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE AGGREGATE LIMITS OF THE POLICIES

ISSUED TO ACANDS, WHICH HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED. IN

OCTOBER 2003, ACANDS

COMMENCED A LAWSUIT SEEKING TO VACATE THE ARBITRATION AWARD AS BEYOND THE PANELS

SCOPE OF AUTHORITY (

ACANDS, INC. V.

TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.,

U.S.D.CT. E.D. PA.). ON SEPTEMBER 16,

2004, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED AN ORDER DENYING ACANDS MOTION TO VACATE THE

ARBITRATION AWARD. ON JANUARY 19, 2006, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT REVERSED THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION AND DECLARED THE

ARBITRATION AWARD VOID ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS. ON MAY 22, 2006, THE UNITED

STATES SUPREME COURT DENIED TPCS PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI SEEKING

REVIEW OF THE THIRD CIRCUITS DECISION. AS A RESULT, THE MATTER HAS BEEN

REMANDED TO DISTRICT COURT AND TPC HAS ASKED THE DISTRICT COURT TO REMAND THE

ARBITRATION TO THE PANEL THAT INITIALLY RULED IN FAVOR OF TPC FOR FURTHER

PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE THIRD CIRCUITS DECISION. ACANDS HAS OPPOSED

THAT REQUEST.

IN THE OTHER PROCEEDING, A RELATED CASE PENDING BEFORE

THE SAME COURT AND COMMENCED IN SEPTEMBER 2000 (

ACANDS V. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.

, U.S.D.CT., E.D.

PA.), ACANDS SOUGHT A DECLARATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ASBESTOS BODILY

INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST ACANDS ARE SUBJECT TO OCCURRENCE LIMITS UNDER INSURANCE

POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. TPC FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION BASED UPON

THE JULY 31, 2003 ARBITRATION DECISION DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DISTRICT COURT

FOUND THE DISPUTE WAS MOOT AS A RESULT OF THE ARBITRATION PANELS DECISION AND

DISMISSED THE CASE. AS A RESULT OF THE JANUARY 19, 2006 RULING BY THE

THIRD CIRCUIT AND THE SUPREME COURTS DENIAL OF CERTIORARI, DESCRIBED IN THE

PARAGRAPH ABOVE, THIS CASE HAS BEEN REINSTATED.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IT HAS MERITORIOUS

POSITIONS IN THESE ACANDS-RELATED PROCEEDINGS AND INTENDS TO LITIGATE

VIGOROUSLY.

IN OCTOBER 2001 AND APRIL 2002, TWO

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS (

WISE V.

TRAVELERS

AND

MENINGER V. TRAVELERS

)

WERE FILED AGAINST TPC AND OTHER INSURERS (NOT INCLUDING SPC) IN STATE COURT IN

WEST VIRGINIA. THESE CASES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE

PROCEEDING IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE THAT THE INSURER DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BY

INAPPROPRIATELY HANDLING AND SETTLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO

REOPEN LARGE NUMBERS OF SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR

DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, DIRECTLY ON INSURERS. LAWSUITS SIMILAR TO

WISE

WERE FILED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND

HAWAII (THESE SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII

ACTIONS). ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2001, PLAINTIFFS IN CONSOLIDATED ASBESTOS

ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE A MASS TORT PANEL OF JUDGES IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT

MOVED TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT TO NAME TPC AS A DEFENDANT, ALLEGING THAT TPC

AND OTHER INSURERS BREACHED ALLEGED DUTIES TO CERTAIN USERS OF ASBESTOS

PRODUCTS. IN MARCH 2002, THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION TO AMEND. PLAINTIFFS

SEEK DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF AND

RAISING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE PRESENTED IN THE WEST VIRGINIA AMENDED

COMPLAINT ARE ALSO PENDING IN TEXAS STATE COURT AGAINST TPC AND SPC, AND IN

LOUISIANA STATE COURT AGAINST TPC (THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THESE SUITS, TOGETHER

WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA SUIT, ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE COMMON LAW

CLAIMS). LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF IN OHIO HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.

ALL OF THE ACTIONS AGAINST TPC DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING

PARAGRAPH, OTHER THAN THE HAWAII ACTIONS, HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO A TEMPORARY

RESTRAINING ORDER ENTERED BY THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT IN NEW YORK THAT HAD

PREVIOUSLY PRESIDED OVER AND APPROVED THE REORGANIZATION IN BANKRUPTCY OF TPCS

FORMER POLICYHOLDER JOHNS-MANVILLE CORPORATION AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES. IN AUGUST 2002,

THE BANKRUPTCY COURT HELD A HEARING ON TPCS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY

INJUNCTION PROHIBITING FURTHER PROSECUTION OF THE LAWSUITS PURSUANT TO THE

REORGANIZATION PLAN AND RELATED ORDERS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS HEARING, THE

COURT ORDERED THE PARTIES TO MEDIATION, APPOINTED A MEDIATOR AND CONTINUED THE

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. DURING

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (CONTINUED)

2003, THE SAME BANKRUPTCY

COURT EXTENDED THE EXISTING INJUNCTION TO APPLY TO AN ADDITIONAL SET OF CASES

FILED IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS IN TEXAS AND OHIO AS WELL AS TO THE ATTORNEYS WHO

ARE PROSECUTING THESE CASES. THE ORDER ALSO ENJOINED THESE ATTORNEYS AND THEIR

RESPECTIVE LAW FIRMS FROM COMMENCING ANY FURTHER LAWSUITS AGAINST TPC BASED

UPON THESE ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE COURT. NOTWITHSTANDING

THE INJUNCTION, ADDITIONAL COMMON LAW CLAIMS WERE FILED AND SERVED ON TPC.

ON NOVEMBER 19, 2003, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT A SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS HAD BEEN

REACHED. THIS SETTLEMENT INCLUDES A LUMP-SUM PAYMENT OF UP TO $412 MILLION BY

TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. AFTER CONTINUED MEETINGS

WITH THE MEDIATOR, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON MAY 25,

2004 THAT A SETTLEMENT RESOLVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PENDING AND SIMILAR FUTURE

COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC HAD ALSO BEEN REACHED. THIS SETTLEMENT REQUIRES A

PAYMENT OF UP TO $90 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

CONTINGENCIES. EACH OF THESE SETTLEMENTS IS CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, AN ORDER OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CLARIFYING THAT ALL OF THESE CLAIMS,

AND SIMILAR FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, ARE BARRED BY PRIOR

ORDERS ENTERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORIGINAL

JOHNS-MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.

ON AUGUST 17, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED

AN ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS AND CLARIFYING ITS PRIOR ORDERS THAT ALL OF

THE PENDING STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON LAW

CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST TPC ARE BARRED. THE ORDER ALSO APPLIES TO SIMILAR DIRECT

ACTION CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

FOUR APPEALS WERE TAKEN FROM THE AUGUST 17, 2004

RULING. ON MARCH 29, 2006, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SUBSTANTIALLY AFFIRMED THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS ORDERS WHILE

VACATING THAT PORTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS ORDERS THAT REQUIRED ALL FUTURE

DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST TPC TO FIRST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT BEFORE

PROCEEDING IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. JUDGMENT WAS ENTERED ON MARCH 31,

2006.

FIVE APPEALS FROM THE MARCH 29, 2006 RULING WERE

FILED IN THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT AND TPC FILED A

CROSS-APPEAL. TWO APPELLANTS VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THEIR APPEALS AND A MOTION

TO DISMISS THE CROSS-APPEAL WAS FILED. ADDITIONALLY, TPC APPEALED FROM A

PROCEDURAL ORDER OF THE DISTRICT COURT RELATING TO THE TIMELINESS OF THE

CROSS-APPEAL. ON JANUARY 17, 2007, THE SECOND CIRCUIT DISMISSED TPCS CROSS-APPEAL

AND DENIED TPCS APPEAL FROM THE PROCEDURAL ORDER. THE THREE REMAINING

PRINCIPAL APPEALS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR DISPOSITION AND REMAIN PENDING. IT

IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW THE APPELLATE COURT WILL RULE ON THE

PENDING APPEALS. THE COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY OF THE SETTLEMENT

AMOUNTS UNLESS AND UNTIL THE ORDERS AND RELIEF BECOME FINAL AND ARE NOT SUBJECT

TO ANY FURTHER APPELLATE REVIEW.

SPC, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

RULINGS OR THE SETTLEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, HAS NUMEROUS DEFENSES IN ALL OF THE

DIRECT ACTION CASES ASSERTING COMMON LAW CLAIMS THAT ARE PENDING AGAINST IT. SPCS

DEFENSES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THESE NOVEL THEORIES HAVE NO BASIS IN LAW; THAT

THEY ARE DIRECTLY AT ODDS WITH THE WELL-ESTABLISHED LAW PERTAINING TO THE

INSURED/INSURER RELATIONSHIP; THAT THERE IS NO GENERALIZED DUTY TO WARN AS

ALLEGED BY THE PLAINTIFFS; AND THAT THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AS TO

MANY OF THESE CLAIMS HAS LONG SINCE EXPIRED. MANY OF THESE DEFENSES HAVE BEEN

RAISED IN INITIAL MOTIONS TO DISMISS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS. THERE

HAVE BEEN FAVORABLE RULINGS DURING 2003 AND 2004 IN TEXAS AND DURING 2004 AND

2005 IN OHIO ON SOME OF THESE MOTIONS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS THAT

DEALT WITH STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND THE VALIDITY OF THE ALLEGED CAUSES OF

ACTIONS. ON MAY 26, 2005, THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO, EIGHTH DISTRICT,

AFFIRMED THE EARLIEST OF THESE FAVORABLE RULINGS. IN TEXAS, ONLY ONE COURT,

223

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

15.

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (CONTINUED)

IN JUNE OF 2005, HAS

DENIED THE INSURERS INITIAL CHALLENGES TO THE PLEADINGS. THAT RULING WAS

CONTRARY TO THE RULINGS BY OTHER COURTS IN SIMILAR CASES, AND SPC AND THE OTHER

INSURER DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MANDAMUS PETITION WITH THE TEXAS COURT OF

APPEALS.

THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING ITS ASBESTOS- AND

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF THESE DISPUTES IS UNCERTAIN. IN

THIS REGARD, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE RESOLUTION

STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE, INCLUDING

SETTLING LITIGATION UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE, SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT LEGAL OUTCOMES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. ANY

SUCH DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND

INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THESE

UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE

CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES

OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL

TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

SHAREHOLDER

LITIGATION AND RELATED PROCEEDINGS

THREE ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA. TWO OF THESE ACTIONS, WHICH WERE

ORIGINALLY CAPTIONED

KAHN V. THE ST. PAUL

TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(NOV. 2, 2004) AND

MICHAEL A. BERNSTEIN PROFIT SHARING PLAN V. THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(NOV. 10, 2004),

ARE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT BY CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY

AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND

DIRECTORS. THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED AS

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION II

, AND A

LEAD PLAINTIFF AND LEAD COUNSEL HAVE BEEN APPOINTED. ON JULY 11, 2005, THE

LEAD PLAINTIFF FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT. THE AMENDED

CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS ALLEGED FAILURE TO MAKE DISCLOSURE RELATING TO

THE PRACTICE OF PAYING BROKERS COMMISSIONS ON A CONTINGENT BASIS, THE COMPANYS

ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN A CONSPIRACY TO RIG BIDS AND THE COMPANYS ALLEGEDLY

IMPROPER USE OF FINITE REINSURANCE PRODUCTS. ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2005, THE

COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

IN

RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION

II

MOVED TO DISMISS THE AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT FOR FAILURE

TO STATE A CLAIM. ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS WAS

PRESENTED ON JUNE 15, 2006. BY ORDER DATED SEPTEMBER 25, 2006, THE

COURT DENIED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS. DISCOVERY HAS COMMENCED. ON NOVEMBER 3,

2006, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

IN RE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION II

MOVED FOR PARTIAL JUDGMENT

ON THE PLEADINGS SEEKING DISMISSAL OF THE ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO THE ALLEGEDLY

IMPROPER USE OF FINITE REINSURANCE PRODUCTS. THAT MOTION REMAINS PENDING. IN THE

THIRD ACTION, AN ALLEGED BENEFICIARY OF THE COMPANYS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN

COMMENCED A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CAPTIONED

SPIZIRI V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(DEC. 28, 2004). THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT BASED ON THE THEORY THAT DEFENDANTS WERE

ALLEGEDLY AWARE OF ISSUES CONCERNING THE

224

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

15.

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (CONTINUED)

VALUE OF SPCS LOSS

RESERVES YET FAILED TO PROTECT PLAN PARTICIPANTS FROM CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN

COMPANY STOCK.

ON JUNE 1,

2005, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

SPIZIRI

MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT. ON JANUARY 4, 2006, THE

PARTIES IN

SPIZIRI

ENTERED INTO A STIPULATION OF

SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT REMAINS SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL.

IN ADDITION, TWO DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA AGAINST ALL

OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS FORMER

DIRECTORS, NAMING THE COMPANY AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT.

ROWE V. FISHMAN, ET AL.

(OCT. 22, 2004) AND

CLARK V. FISHMAN, ET AL.

(NOV. 18,

2004). THE DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS

AS

ROWE, ET AL. V. FISHMAN, ET AL.

AND A CONSOLIDATED DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED. THE CONSOLIDATED

DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT ASSERTS STATE LAW CLAIMS, INCLUDING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY

DUTY, BASED ON ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE ALLEGED IN

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION II

AND

SPIZIRI

DESCRIBED ABOVE. ON MARCH 23, 2006, THE COURT

DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND, ON MARCH 30, 2006, ENTERED

JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS. ON JUNE 5,

2006, PLAINTIFFS IN

ROWE

MOVED TO

ALTER OR AMEND THE JUDGMENT FOR LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT. THE COMPANY

AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS OPPOSED THAT MOTION. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2006, THE

PARTIES IN

ROWE

ENTERED INTO A STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT

WHEREBY PLAINTIFFS RELEASED THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FROM LIABILITY IN

EXCHANGE FOR AN AGREEMENT BY DEFENDANTS TO ADOPT CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

MEASURES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY. THE SETTLEMENT REMAINS SUBJECT TO

COURT APPROVAL.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

THE PENDING LAWSUITS HAVE NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY; HOWEVER,

THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF

ONE OR MORE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD. THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY ITS

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED UNDER MINNESOTA LAW. AS PART OF

THAT OBLIGATION, THE COMPANY WILL ADVANCE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ATTORNEYS

FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES THEY INCUR IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN

PROCEEDINGS ADDRESSING DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY

BE INITIATED BY THE COMPANY OR THE REINSURERS AND MAY INVOLVE THE TERMS OF THE

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THE COVERAGE OF PARTICULAR CLAIMS, EXCLUSIONS UNDER THE

AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS COUNTERCLAIMS FOR RESCISSION OF THE AGREEMENTS. ONE OF

THESE DISPUTES IS THE ACTION DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

THE COMPANYS GULF OPERATION BROUGHT AN ACTION ON MAY 22,

2003, AS AMENDED ON MAY 12, 2004, IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, COUNTY

OF NEW YORK (

GULF INSURANCE COMPANY V.

TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL.

), AGAINST TRANSATLANTIC

REINSURANCE COMPANY (TRANSATLANTIC), XL REINSURANCE AMERICA, INC. (XL),

ODYSSEY AMERICA REINSURANCE CORPORATION (ODYSSEY), EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE

COMPANY (EMPLOYERS) AND GERLING GLOBAL REINSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA

(GERLING), TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE UNDER REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF

AND RELATED TO GULFS FEBRUARY 2003 SETTLEMENT OF A COVERAGE DISPUTE UNDER

A VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE PROTECTION INSURANCE POLICY. THE REINSURERS HAVE

ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING RESCISSION OF THE VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF

CONTRACT. SEPARATE ACTIONS FILED BY TRANSATLANTIC AND GERLING HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATED WITH THE ORIGINAL GULF ACTION FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES.

COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (CONTINUED)

ON OCTOBER 1, 2003, GULF ENTERED INTO A FINAL

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH EMPLOYERS, AND ALL CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS WITH

RESPECT TO EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED. ON MAY 26, 2004, THE COURT

DENIED GULFS MOTION TO DISMISS CERTAIN CLAIMS ASSERTED BY TRANSATLANTIC AND DENIED

A JOINT MOTION BY TRANSATLANTIC, XL AND ODYSSEY FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST

GULF. ON DECEMBER 22, 2006, GULF AND XL ENTERED INTO A FINAL SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT WHICH RESOLVES ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN GULF AND XL UNDER THE REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS AT ISSUE IN THE LITIGATION. FACT AND EXPERT DISCOVERY ARE COMPLETE

WITH RESPECT TO THE REMAINING PARTIES: TRANSATLANTIC, ODYSSEY AND GERLING.

GULF, TRANSATLANTIC AND GERLING HAVE FILED MOTIONS FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY

JUDGMENT. THE COURT HAS NOT YET SET A TRIAL DATE. GULF DENIES THE REINSURERS

ALLEGATIONS, BELIEVES THAT IT HAS A STRONG LEGAL BASIS TO COLLECT THE AMOUNTS

DUE UNDER THE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THE

ACTIONS.

BASED ON THE COMPANYS BELIEFS ABOUT ITS LEGAL

POSITIONS IN ITS VARIOUS REINSURANCE RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT ANY OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN THREE CONSOLIDATED

LAWSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF

LOUISIANA ARISING OUT OF DISPUTES WITH CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS OVER WHETHER

ARE PROPOSED CLASS ACTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS ONE OF SEVERAL INSURER

DEFENDANTS.

XAVIER

IS AN INDIVIDUAL SUIT INVOLVING A

PROPERTY INSURANCE POLICY BROUGHT BY ONE OF THE COMPANYS INSUREDS. THE LOSSES

INVOLVED IN ALL OF THESE SUITS ALLEGEDLY WERE CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE NEW

ORLEANS LEVEES. ON NOVEMBER 27, 2006, THE COURT ISSUED A RULING IN THE

THREE CONSOLIDATED CASES DENYING THE MOTIONS OF THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OTHER

INSURERS FOR A SUMMARY DISPOSITION OF THE CASES. THE COURTS RULING DOES NOT

DETERMINE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS ARE OWED UNDER ANY OF THE COMPANYS

POLICIES OR OTHERWISE REACH THE MERITS OF THE POLICYHOLDERS CLAIMS. THE

COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE RULING AND, ALONG WITH CERTAIN OTHER INSURERS NAMED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED LAWSUITS, FILED A MOTION WITH THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, SEEKING TO HAVE THE COURT OF APPEALS ACCEPT AN

IMMEDIATE APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURTS RULING. ON FEBRUARY 1, 2007,

THE FIFTH CIRCUIT ACCEPTED THE APPEAL.

AS PART OF ONGOING,

INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS, THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED

SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

AUTHORITIES. THE AREAS OF PENDING INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE ITS

RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS, AND THE COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT WITH NON-TRADITIONAL

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS.  THE

COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS OR REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION,

IN EACH CASE WITH RESPECT TO ONE OR BOTH OF THE AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE, FROM: (I) STATE

COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE FROM OTHER AGENCIES OR

AUTHORITIES.

THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, OUTSIDE COUNSEL, WITH THE OVERSIGHT OF

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES. THIS REVIEW INITIALLY FOCUSED ON

THE COMPANYS RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND WAS COMMENCED AFTER THE

ANNOUNCEMENT OF LITIGATION BROUGHT BY THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE

AGAINST A MAJOR BROKER.

THE INTERNAL REVIEW WAS EXPANDED TO ADDRESS THE

VARIOUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION DESCRIBED ABOVE AND TO VERIFY WHETHER THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THESE AREAS HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANYS

REVIEW HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE, INVOLVING THE EXAMINATION OF E-MAILS AND

UNDERWRITING FILES, AS WELL AS INTERVIEWS OF CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES. THE

COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO RECEIVE AND RESPOND TO ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION AND WILL EXPAND ITS REVIEW ACCORDINGLY.

TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS FOUND ONLY A FEW INSTANCES OF

CONDUCT THAT WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE CODE OF CONDUCT. THE

COMPANY HAS RESPONDED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO RESPOND, APPROPRIATELY TO ANY SUCH

CONDUCT.

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL REVIEW WITH RESPECT TO FINITE

REINSURANCE CONSIDERED FINITE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY BOTH PURCHASED AND SOLD. THE

COMPANY HAS COMPLETED ITS REVIEW WITH RESPECT TO THE IDENTIFIED FINITE PRODUCTS

PURCHASED AND SOLD, AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT NO ADJUSTMENT TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS REQUIRED.

EXCEPT AS SETTLED AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE

INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE ONGOING, AS ARE THE COMPANYS

EFFORTS TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUTHORITIES, AND THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES COULD

ASK THAT ADDITIONAL WORK BE PERFORMED OR REACH CONCLUSIONS DIFFERENT FROM THE

COMPANYS. ACCORDINGLY, IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO REACH ANY CONCLUSIONS AS TO

THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS.

FOUR PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS ARE PENDING AGAINST A NUMBER OF INSURANCE BROKERS AND INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, BY PLAINTIFFS WHO

ALLEGEDLY PURCHASED INSURANCE PRODUCTS THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE DEFENDANT

BROKERS. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT VARIOUS INSURANCE BROKERS CONSPIRED WITH EACH

OTHER AND WITH VARIOUS INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS

AFFILIATES, TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE PREMIUMS, ALLOCATE BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS AND

RIG BIDS FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS OFFERED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. THE COMPLAINTS ARE

CAPTIONED.

PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING THE FOUR NAMED PLAINTIFFS IN THE ABOVE-REFERENCED CLASS

ACTIONS, FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT NAMING VARIOUS

BROKERS AND INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, ON

BEHALF OF A PUTATIVE NATIONWIDE CLASS OF POLICYHOLDERS. THE COMPLAINT INCLUDES

CAUSES OF ACTION UNDER THE SHERMAN ACT, THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT

PROHIBITING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. PLAINTIFFS SEEK MONETARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING

PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND TREBLED DAMAGES, PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, RESTITUTION,

INCLUDING DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS, INTEREST AND COSTS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS

FEES. ON NOVEMBER 29, 2005, ALL DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT

FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM. ORAL ARGUMENTS ON THE DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS

WERE HEARD ON JULY 26, 2006. ON OCTOBER 3, 2006, THE COURT RULED THAT

THE COMPLAINT FAILED TO PLEAD ACTIONABLE CLAIMS UNDER THE SHERMAN ACT OR RICO,

PROVIDED PLAINTIFFS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPLEAD THOSE CLAIMS AND RESERVED

DECISION WITH RESPECT TO REMAINING STATE LAW CLAIMS. ON NOVEMBER 30, 2006,

DEFENDANTS RENEWED THEIR MOTIONS TO DISMISS. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2006, THE

NAMED PLAINTIFFS MOVED TO CERTIFY A NATIONWIDE CLASS CONSISTING OF ALL PERSONS

WHO BETWEEN AUGUST 26, 1994 AND THE DATE OF CLASS CERTIFICATION ENGAGED

THE SERVICES OF A BROKER DEFENDANT (OR RELATED ENTITY) IN CONNECTION WITH THE

PROCUREMENT OR RENEWAL OF INSURANCE AND WHO ENTERED INTO OR RENEWED A CONTRACT

OF INSURANCE WITH ONE OR MORE OF THE INSURER DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY.

THE RENEWED MOTION TO DISMISS AND CLASS CERTIFICATION MOTION REMAIN PENDING.

ALSO, ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN STATE AND FEDERAL

COURTS AGAINST THE COMPANY INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

AND FURTHER

ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NO

MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY.

IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY IS

INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS, NOT INVOLVING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS,

ARISING MOSTLY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS EITHER AS A

LIABILITY INSURER DEFENDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS,

OR AS AN INSURER DEFENDING CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST IT RELATING TO COVERAGE OR

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES. WHILE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A

FUTURE PERIOD, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, NONE WOULD LIKELY HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

ON JULY 23, 2004, THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION

OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATE PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $1.63

BILLION ($1.07 BILLION AFTER-TAX). THE COMPANY RECORDED THESE ADJUSTMENTS AS

CHARGES IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004.

THROUGH AN INFORMAL COMMENT PROCESS, THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION

FINANCE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, WHICH THE COMPANY HAS

PROVIDED. SPECIFICALLY, THE STAFF HAS ASKED FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE

COMPANYS ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN OF SPCS INSURANCE RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND PREMIUMS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AND HOW THOSE

ADJUSTMENTS MAY RELATE TO SPCS RESERVES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER OF SPC

AND TPC. AFTER REVIEWING THE STAFFS

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

15.

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (CONTINUED)

QUESTIONS

AND COMMENTS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

FOR THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE. IF, HOWEVER, THE STAFF DISAGREES, SOME OR

ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS BEING DISCUSSED MAY NOT BE RECORDED AS CHARGES IN THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, THEREBY INCREASING NET INCOME FOR

THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2004 AND INCREASING SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, 2005 AND 2004, IN EACH CASE BY THE APPROXIMATE AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF THE

CHANGE. THE EFFECT ON TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTS

OF DEFERRED TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, 2005 AND 2004 WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL. INCREASES TO GOODWILL AND DEFERRED

DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANYS

REPORTS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED

WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS RULES AND

FORMS, AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER,

AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURES. ANY

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE

ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THE DESIRED CONTROL OBJECTIVES. THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, HAS EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006. BASED UPON THAT EVALUATION AND SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENTS REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED

TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE

COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED BY MANAGEMENT, ARE UNDER THE GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF

THE COMPANYS AUDIT COMMITTEE.

THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT.

·

PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

·

PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY

IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS;

AND

·

PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO

THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS,

OR THAT THE DEGREE OR COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY

DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE STANDARD MEASURES

ADOPTED BY MANAGEMENT IN MAKING ITS EVALUATION ARE THE MEASURES IN THE

INTERNAL-CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK PUBLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

BASED UPON ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED

THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, AND THAT THERE WERE NO MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF THAT DATE.

KPMG LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM, WHICH HAS AUDITED AND REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-K, HAS ISSUED ITS WRITTEN ATTESTATION

REPORT ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

THAT THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND

SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND AN OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY

OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO

THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS,

OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY

DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, IS

FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY

THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS

OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OF THE ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME, CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH
