item1.business
the travelers companies,inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the company) is a holding company principally
engaged, through its subsidiaries, in providing a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations and
individuals. the company is incorporated as a general business corporation under the laws of the state of minnesota and is one of the oldest insurance organizations in the united states, dating back
to 1853. the principal executive offices of the company are located at 485 lexington avenue, new york, new york 10017, and its telephone number is (917)778-6000. the company also
maintains executive offices in hartford, connecticut,
and st.paul, minnesota. the term "trv" in this document refers to the travelers companies,inc., the parent holding company excluding subsidiaries.
for
a summary of the company's revenues, operating income and total assets by reportable business segments, see note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
property and casualty insurance operations
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive in the areas of price, service, product offerings, agent
relationships and method of distribution. distribution methods include the use of independent agents, exclusive agents, direct marketing (including use of toll-free numbers and the
internet) and/or salaried employees. according toa.m. best, there are approximately 1,036 property and casualty groups in the united states, comprising approximately 2,462 property and
casualty companies. of those groups, the top 150 accounted for approximately 92% of the consolidated industry's total net written premiums in 2010. the company competes with both foreign and domestic
insurers. in addition, several property and casualty insurers writing commercial lines of business, including the company, offer products for alternative forms of risk protection in addition to
traditional insurance products. these products include large deductible programs and various forms of self-insurance, some of which utilize captive insurance companies and risk retention
groups. the company's competitive position in the marketplace is based on many factors, including the following:
premiums charged;
contract terms and conditions;
products and services offered;
claim service;
agent, broker and client relationships;
local presence;
geographic scope of business;
overall financial strength;
ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;
experience and qualifications of employees; and
technology and information systems.
in
addition, the marketplace is affected by available capacity of the insurance industry, as measured by policyholders' surplus, and the availability of reinsurance. industry capacity as
measured by policyholders' surplus expands and contracts primarily in conjunction with profit levels generated by the industry, less amounts returned to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases. capital raised by debt and equity offerings may also increase policyholders' surplus.
table of contents
pricing and underwriting
pricing of the company's property and casualty insurance products is generally developed based upon an estimation of expected losses,
the expenses associated with producing, issuing and servicing business and managing claims, the time value of money related to the expected loss and expense cash flows, and a reasonable allowance for
profit that considers the capital needed to support the company's business. the company has a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that over the long-term emphasizes
profitable growth rather than premium volume or market share. the company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations regarding rate and policy form approvals. the applicable
state laws and regulations establish standards in certain lines of business to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or used to engage in unfair price competition.
the company's ability to increase rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each respective state's requirements, as well as the competitive market environment.

catastrophe exposure
the wide geographic distribution of the company's property and casualty insurance operations exposes it to claims arising out of
catastrophes. the company uses various analyses and methods, including sophisticated computer modeling processes, to continually monitor and analyze underwriting risks of business in natural
catastrophe-prone areas and target risk areas for conventional terrorist attacks (defined as attacks other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events). the company relies, in part, upon
this analysis to make underwriting decisions designed to manage its exposure on catastrophe-exposed business. for example, the company has limited the writing of new property and homeowners business
in some markets and has selectively taken underwriting actions on existing business. these underwriting actions include tightened underwriting standards, selective price increases and deductibles
specific to hurricane-, tornado-, wind- and hail-prone areas. see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationscatastrophe
table of contents
modeling"
and "changing climate conditions." the company also utilizes reinsurance to manage its aggregate exposures to catastrophes. see "reinsurance."
the
company is organized into three reportable business segments: business insurance; financial, professional& international insurance; and personal insurance.
business insurance
the business insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services to its clients
primarily in the united states. business insurance is organized into the following six groups, which collectively comprise business insurance core
operations:
select accounts provides small businesses with property and casualty
products, including commercial multi-peril, property, general liability, commercial auto and workers' compensation insurance.
commercial accounts provides mid-sized businesses with
property and casualty products, including commercial multi-peril, property, general liability, commercial auto and workers' compensation insurance.
national accounts provides large companies with casualty products and
services, including workers' compensation, general liability and automobile liability, as well as property coverages, generally utilizing loss-sensitive products, on both a bundled and
unbundled basis. national accounts also includes the company's commercial residual market business, which primarily offers workers' compensation products and services to the involuntary market.
industry-focused underwriting.the following units provide
targeted industries with differentiated combinations of insurance coverage, risk management, claims handling and other services:
construction serves a broad range of construction businesses, offering
guaranteed cost products for small to mid-sized policyholders and loss-sensitive programs for larger accounts. for the larger accounts, the customer and the company work
together in actively managing and controlling exposure and claims, and they share risk through policy features such as deductibles or retrospective rating. products offered include workers'
compensation, general liability, umbrella and commercial auto coverages, and other risk management solutions.
technology serves small to large companies involved in telecommunications,
information technology, medical technology and electronics manufacturing, offering a comprehensive portfolio of products and services. products offered include property, commercial auto, general
liability, workers' compensation, umbrella, internet liability, technology errors and omissions coverages and global companion products.
public sector services provides insurance products and services to public
entities including municipalities, counties, indian nation gaming organizations and selected special government districts such as water and sewer utilities. the policies written by this unit typically
cover property, commercial auto, general liability and professional liability exposures.
oil& gas provides specialized property and liability products and
services for customers involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, including operators and drilling contractors, as well as various service and supply companies and
manufacturers that support upstream operations. the policies written by this business group cover risks including physical damage, liability and business interruption.
table of contents
agribusiness serves small to medium-sized agricultural businesses,
including farms, ranches, wineries and related operations, offering property and liability coverages other than workers' compensation.
target risk underwriting.the following units serve
commercial businesses requiring specialized product underwriting, claims handling and risk management services:
national property provides traditional and customized property insurance
programs to large and mid-sized customers, including office building owners, manufacturers, municipalities and schools, retailers and service businesses. these insurance programs cover
losses on buildings, business personal property and business interruption exposures.
inland marine provides insurance for goods in transit and movable objects
for customers such as jewelers, museums, contractors and the transportation industry. builders' risk insurance is also offered to customers during the construction, renovation or repair of buildings
and other structures.
ocean marine serves the marine transportation industry and related
services, as well as other businesses involved in international trade. the company's product offerings in this unit fall under six main coverage categories: marine liability, cargo, hull and
machinery, protection and indemnity, pleasure craft, and marine property and liability.
excess casualty serves small to mid-sized commercial
businesses, offering mono-line umbrella and excess coverage where the company typically does not write the primary casualty coverage, or where other business units within the company
prefer to access the underwriting expertise and/or limit capacity of the excess casualty business unit.
boiler& machinery serves small to large companies, offering
comprehensive breakdown coverages for equipment, including property and business interruption coverages. through the boilerre unit, boiler& machinery also serves other property and casualty
carriers that do not have in-house expertise with reinsurance, underwriting, engineering, claim handling and risk management services for this type of coverage.
global underwriting provides insurance to foreign organizations with
property and liability exposures located in the united states (reverse-flow) as part of a global program.
specialized distribution.the following units market and
underwrite their products to customers predominantly through licensed wholesale, general and program agents that manage customers' unique insurance requirements:
northland provides insurance coverage for the commercial transportation
industry, as well as commercial liability and package policies for small, difficult to place specialty classes of commercial business on an admitted or excess and surplus lines basis.
national programs offers tailored property and casualty programs on an
admitted basis for customers with common risk characteristics or coverage requirements. programs available include those for entertainment, architects and engineers, equipment rental, golf services
and owners of franchised businesses.
business
insurance also includes the special liability group (which manages the company's asbestos and environmental liabilities) and the assumed reinsurance and certain international
and other runoff operations, which are collectively referred to as business insurance other.

principal markets and methods of distribution
business insurance distributes its products through approximately 10,500 independent agencies and brokers located throughout the united
states that are serviced by 120 field offices and three customer service centers. business insurance continues to make significant investments in enhanced technology utilizing internet-based
applications to provide real-time interface capabilities with independent agencies and brokers. business insurance builds relationships with well-established, independent
insurance agencies and brokers. in selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products, business insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency's or broker's financial
strength, staff experience and strategic fit with the company's operating and marketing plans. once an agency or broker is appointed, business insurance carefully monitors its performance. the
majority of products offered by the select accounts, commercial accounts, industry-focused underwriting and target-risk underwriting groups are distributed through a common base of
independent agents and brokers, many of whom also sell the company's personal insurance products. additionally, the industry-focused underwriting and target risk underwriting groups may underwrite
business with agents that specialize in servicing the needs of certain of the industries served by these groups.
select accounts is a leading provider of property and casualty insurance products to small businesses, generally with fewer than 50
employees. products offered by select accounts are guaranteed-cost policies, including packaged products covering property and liability exposures. each small business risk is
independently evaluated via an automated underwriting platform which in turn enables agents to quote, bind and issue a substantial amount of small business risks at their desktop. risks with more
complex characteristics are underwritten with the assistance of company personnel. the automated underwriting platform has significantly streamlined the agent desktop underwriting process and, as a
result, has allowed the company to expand the number of distributors affiliated with select accounts.
table of contents
commercial accounts sells a broad range of property and casualty insurance products through a large network of independent agents and
brokers, primarily targeting mid-sized businesses with 50 to 1,000 employees. the company offers a full line of products to its commercial accounts customers with an emphasis on guaranteed
cost programs. each account is underwritten based on the unique risk characteristics, loss history and coverage needs of the account. the ability to underwrite at this detailed level allows commercial
accounts to have a broad risk appetite and a diversified customer base.
national accounts sells a variety of casualty products and services to large companies through a network of national and regional brokers,
primarily utilizing loss-sensitive products in connection with a large deductible or self-insured program and, to a lesser extent, a retrospectively rated or a guaranteed cost
insurance policy. national accounts also provides property and casualty products and services through retail brokers on an unbundled basis, using third-party administrators for insureds who utilize
programs such as collateralized deductibles, captive reinsurers and self-insurance. national accounts provides insurance-related services, such as risk management services, claims
administration, loss control and risk management information services, either in addition to, or in lieu of, pure risk coverage, and generated $195million of fee income in 2011, excluding
commercial residual market business. the commercial residual market business of national accounts sells claims and policy management services to workers' compensation pools throughout the united
states, and generated $61million in fee income in 2011.
workers'
compensation accounted for approximately 73% of sales to national accounts customers during 2011, based on direct written premiums and fees.
industry-focused underwriting markets property and casualty insurance products and services through a large network of agents and brokers.
these products and services are tailored to targeted industry segments of significant size and complexity that require unique underwriting, claim, risk management or other insurance-related products
and services.
target risk underwriting markets property and casualty insurance products and services through a large network of agents and brokers to a
wide customer base having specialized property and casualty coverage requirements.
specialized distribution distributes admitted and excess and surplus lines property and casualty products predominantly through selected
wholesale agents, both on a brokerage and managing general underwriting basis, and through selected program agents. brokers, general agents and program agents operate in certain markets that are not
typically served by the company's appointed retail agents, or they maintain certain affinity arrangements in specialized market segments. the wholesale excess and surplus lines market, which is
characterized by the absence of rate and form regulation, allows for more flexibility to write certain classes of business. in working with wholesale or program agents on a brokerage basis,
specialized distribution underwrites the business and sets the premium level. in working with wholesale or program agents on a managing general underwriting or program manager basis, the agents
produce and underwrite business subject to underwriting guidelines that have been specifically designed for each facility or program.
pricing and underwriting
business insurance has developed an underwriting and pricing methodology that incorporates underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial
and product development disciplines for particular industries, and enables business insurance to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters. this approach is designed to
maintain high-quality underwriting and pricing discipline utilizing proprietary data gathered and analyzed with respect to business over many years. the underwriters and engineers use this
information, which provides specialized knowledge about specific industry segments, to assess and evaluate risks prior to quotation.
table of contents
for
smaller businesses meeting pre-determined exposure characteristics and thresholds, select accounts utilizes an automated underwriting system that enables agents to issue
a significant number of policies at their desktop.
a
portion of business in this segment, particularly in national accounts and construction, is written with large deductible insurance policies. under workers' compensation insurance
contracts with deductible features, the company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. the company is subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount
and is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. at december31, 2011, contractholder payables on unpaid losses within the deductible layer of large deductible policies and the
associated receivables were each approximately $5.15billion. retrospectively rated policies are primarily used for workers' compensation coverage. although the retrospectively rated feature of
the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the company, it introduces additional credit risk to the company. premium receivables from holders of retrospectively rated policies totaled
approximately $190million at december31, 2011. significant collateral, primarily letters of credit and, to a lesser extent, cash collateral or trusts, is generally requested for large
deductible plans and/or retrospectively rated policies that provide for deferred collection of deductible recoveries and/or ultimate premiums. the amount of collateral requested is predicated upon the
creditworthiness of the customer and the nature of the insured risks. business insurance continually monitors the credit exposure on individual accounts and the adequacy of collateral.
product lines
the business insurance segment writes the following types of coverages:
workers'
compensation.provides coverage for employers for specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to
employees. there are typically four types of benefits payable under workers' compensation policies: medical benefits, disability benefits, death benefits and vocational rehabilitation benefits. the
company emphasizes managed care cost containment strategies, which involve employers, employees and care providers in a cooperative effort that focuses on the injured employee's early return to work
and cost-effective quality care. the company offers the following types of workers' compensation products:
guaranteed-cost insurance products, in which policy premium charges are fixed for the period of coverage and
do not vary as a result of the insured's loss experience;
loss-sensitive insurance products, including large deductible and retrospectively rated policies, in which
fees or premiums are adjusted based on actual loss experience of the insured during the policy period; and
service programs, which are generally sold to the company's national accounts customers, where the company receives fees
rather than premiums for providing loss prevention, risk management, and claim and benefit administration services to organizations under service agreements.
the
company also participates in state assigned risk pools as a servicing carrier and pool participant.
commercial
automobile.provides coverage for businesses against losses incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties,
property damage to an insured's vehicle and property damage to other vehicles and other property resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks in a business.
property.provides coverage for loss of or damage to buildings, inventory and
equipment from a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, volcanic eruptions, theft, vandalism, fires,
explosions,
table of contents
terrorism
and financial loss due to business interruption resulting from covered property damage. for additional information on terrorism coverages, see "reinsurancecatastrophe
reinsuranceterrorism risk insurance acts." property also includes specialized equipment insurance, which provides coverage for loss or damage resulting from the mechanical breakdown of
boilers and machinery, and ocean and inland marine insurance, which provides coverage for goods in transit and unique, one-of-a-kind exposures.
general
liability.insures businesses against third-party claims arising from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their
operations, including as a result of injuries sustained from products sold. specialized liability policies may also include coverage for directors' and officers' liability arising in their official
capacities, employment practices liability insurance, fiduciary liability for trustees and sponsors of pension, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans, errors and omissions insurance for
employees, agents, professionals and others arising from acts or failures to act under specified circumstances, as well as umbrella and excess insurance.
commercial
multi-peril.provides a combination of the property and liability coverages described in the foregoing product line descriptions.
net retention policy
the following discussion reflects the company's retention policy with respect to the business insurance segment as of january1,
2012. for third-party liability, business insurance generally limits its net retention, through the use of reinsurance, to a maximum of $18.8million per insured, per occurrence after the
company retains an aggregate layer of expected losses. the net retained amount per risk for property exposures is generally limited to $18.0million, after reinsurance. the company generally
retains its workers' compensation exposures. reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per-risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are
reached. the company utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. the company may also retain amounts greater than those
described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

competition
the insurance industry is represented in the commercial marketplace by many insurance companies of varying size as well as other
entities offering risk alternatives, such as self-insured retentions or captive programs. market competition works within the insurance regulatory framework to set the price charged for
insurance products and the levels of coverage and service provided. a company's success in the competitive commercial insurance landscape is largely measured by its ability to provide insurance and
services, including claims handling and risk control services, at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer, as well as its ability to retain existing customers and to
attract new customers.
select
accounts business is typically written through independent agents and, to a lesser extent, regional brokers and direct writers. both national and regional property and casualty
insurance companies compete in the select accounts market which generally comprises lower-hazard, "main street" business customers. risks are underwritten and priced using standard industry practices
and a combination of proprietary and standard industry product offerings. competition in this market is primarily based on product offerings, service levels, ease of doing business and price. select
accounts has established a strong marketing relationship with its distribution network and has provided this network with defined underwriting policies, a broad array of products, competitive prices
and a highly
efficient, automated platform that significantly reduces the time period between quoting a price on a policy and issuing that policy. in addition, the company has established centralized service
centers to help agents perform many service functions, in return for a fee.
commercial
accounts business has historically been principally written through independent agents and brokers. competitors in this market are primarily national property and casualty
insurance companies that write most classes of business using traditional products and pricing, and regional insurance companies. companies compete based on product offerings, service levels, price
and claim and loss prevention services. efficiency through automation and rapid response time to customer needs is one key to success in this market.
in
the national accounts market, competition is based on price, product offerings, claim and loss prevention services, managed care cost containment, risk management information systems
and collateral requirements. national accounts competes with national property and casualty insurance companies, as well as with other underwriters of property and casualty insurance in the
alternative risk transfer market, such as risk retention groups, self-insurance plans, captives managed by others, and a variety of other risk-financing vehicles and
mechanisms. the residual market group competes for state contracts to provide claims and policy management services. national accounts services approximately 32% of the total workers' compensation
assigned risk market, making the company one of the largest servicing carriers in the industry.
there
are several other business groups in business insurance that compete in focused target markets. each of these markets is different and requires unique combinations of industry
knowledge, customized coverage, specialized risk control and loss handling services, along with partnerships with agents and brokers that also focus on these markets. some of these business groups
compete with national carriers with similarly dedicated underwriting and marketing groups, whereas others compete with smaller regional companies. each of these business groups has regional structures
that allow them to deliver personalized service and local knowledge to their customer base. specialized agents and brokers, including managing general agents and wholesale agents, supplement this
strategy. in all of these business groups, the competitive strategy typically is market leadership attained through focused industry knowledge applied to insurance and risk needs.
financial, professional& international insurance
the financial, professional& international insurance segment includes surety and financial liability coverages, which primarily
use credit-based underwriting processes, as well as property and
table of contents

the republic of ireland, offers specialized insurance and risk management services to several customer groups, including, among others, those in the technology, public services, and financial and
professional services industry sectors. international, through its lloyd's syndicate (syndicate 5000), for which the company provides 100% of the capital, underwrites through five principal business
unitsmarine, global property, accident& special risks, power& utilities and aviation.

principal markets and methods of distribution
within the financial, professional& international insurance segment, bond& financial products distributes the vast
majority of its products in the united states through approximately 6,200 of the same independent agencies and brokers that distribute the business insurance segment's products. these independent
agencies and brokers are located throughout the united states. bond& financial products, in conjunction with the business insurance segment, continues to make investments in enhanced
technology utilizing internet-based applications to provide real-time interface capabilities with its independent agencies and brokers. bond& financial products builds
relationships with well-established, independent insurance agencies and brokers. in selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products, bond& financial
products considers, among other attributes, each agency's or broker's profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic fit with its operating and marketing plans. once an agency or
broker is appointed, its ongoing performance is closely monitored. in addition, bond& financial products sells its surety products through independent brokers in the united kingdom.
the
international market distributes its products principally through brokers in the domestic markets of each of the countries in which it operates. it also writes business at lloyd's,
where its products are distributed through lloyd's wholesale and retail brokers. by virtue of lloyd's worldwide licenses, financial, professional& international insurance has access to
international markets across the world. in late 2008, the company commenced an exclusive relationship with a broker in the republic of ireland that significantly increased the 2009 volume of personal
automobile coverage written and also resulted in the company writing personal household coverages. the company ceased writing business through this relationship in the fourth quarter of 2010 and
ceased writing all remaining personal insurance business in the republic of ireland in the fourth quarter of 2011.
pricing and underwriting
financial, professional& international insurance has developed underwriting and pricing methodologies that incorporate
dedicated underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product development disciplines. this approach is designed to maintain high quality underwriting and pricing discipline, based on an
in-depth knowledge of the specific account, industry or country. underwriters use industry and proprietary data gathered and analyzed over many years to assess and evaluate risks prior to
quotation, and then use proprietary forms (for non-lloyd's and non-surety markets) to tailor insurance coverage to insureds within target markets. this methodology enables
financial, professional& international insurance to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters.
product lines
the financial, professional& international insurance segment writes the following types of
coverages:
fidelity and
surety.provides fidelity insurance coverage, which protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an
employee, and surety, which is a three-party agreement whereby the insurer agrees to pay a third party or make complete an obligation in response to the default, acts or omissions of an insured.
surety is generally provided for construction performance, legal matters such as appeals, trustees in bankruptcy and probate and other performance bonds.
general
liability.provides coverage for specialized liability exposures as described above in more detail in the "business insurance" section
of this report.
international.provides coverage for employers' liability (similar to workers'
compensation coverage in the united states), public and product liability (the equivalent of general liability), professional indemnity (similar to professional liability coverage), motor (similar to
automobile
table of contents
coverage
in the united states), property, surety, marine, aviation, personal accident and kidnap& ransom. marine provides coverage for ship hulls, cargoes carried, private yachts,
marine-related liability, offshore energy, ports and terminals, fine art and terrorism. aviation provides coverage for worldwide aviation risks including physical damage and liabilities for airline,
aerospace, general aviation, aviation war and space risks. personal accident provides financial protection in the event of death or disablement due to accidental bodily injury, while kidnap&
ransom provides financial protection against kidnap, hijack, illegal detention and extortion. while the covered hazards may be similar to those in the u.s. market, the different legal environments can
make the product risks and coverage terms potentially very different from those the company faces in the united states.
other.coverages include property, workers' compensation, commercial automobile and
commercial multi-peril, which are described above in more detail in the "business insurance" section of this report.
net retention policy
the following discussion reflects the company's retention policy with respect to the financial, professional& international
insurance segment as of january1, 2012. in the u.s. operations for third party liability, including but not limited to umbrella liability, professional liability, directors' and officers'
liability, and employment practices liability, financial, professional& international insurance generally limits net retentions, through the use of reinsurance, to up to $15.2million
per policy after the company retains an aggregate layer of expected losses. for surety protection, where insured limits are often significant, the company generally retains up to $55.0million
probable maximum loss (pml) per principal but may retain higher amounts based on the type of obligation, credit quality and other credit risk factors. in the international operations,
per-risk retentions are usually limited up to $16.0million, after reinsurance. reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per risk
retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached. the company utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. the
company may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

table of contents
competition
the competitive landscape in which bond& financial products operates is affected by many of the same factors described
previously for the business insurance segment. competitors in this market are primarily national property and casualty insurance companies that write most classes of business using traditional
products and pricing and, to a lesser extent, regional insurance companies and companies that have developed niche programs for specific industry segments.
bond&
financial products underwrites and markets its products to national, mid-sized and small businesses and organizations, as well as individuals. the company
believes that its reputation for timely and consistent decision making, a nationwide network of local underwriting, claims and industry experts and strong producer and customer relationships, as well
as its ability to offer its customers a full range of products, provides bond& financial products an advantage over many of its competitors and enables it to compete effectively in a complex,
dynamic marketplace. the company believes that the ability of bond& financial products to cross-sell its products to customers of the business insurance and personal insurance
segments provides additional competitive advantages for the company.
international
competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of ireland. companies compete on the basis of price, product
offerings and the level of claim and risk management services provided. the company has developed expertise in various markets in these countries similar to those served in the united states and
provides both property and casualty coverage for these markets.
at
lloyd's, international competes with other syndicates operating in the lloyd's market as well as international and domestic insurers in the various markets where the lloyd's operation
writes business worldwide. competition is again based on price, product and service. the company focuses on lines it believes it can underwrite effectively and profitably with an emphasis on
short-tail insurance lines.
personal insurance
the company's personal insurance segment writes a broad range of property and casualty insurance covering individuals' personal risks.
the primary products of automobile and homeowners insurance are complemented by a broad suite of related coverages.

principal markets and methods of distribution
personal insurance products are distributed primarily through approximately 12,500 independent agents located throughout the united
states, supported by personnel in 16 marketing regions and seven service centers. while the principal markets for personal insurance products continue to be in states along the east coast, california
and texas, the business continues to expand its geographic presence across the united states.
table of contents
in
selecting new independent agencies to distribute its products, personal insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency's profitability, financial stability, staff experience
and strategic fit with the
segment's operating and marketing plans. once an agency is appointed, personal insurance carefully monitors its performance.
agents
can access the company's agency service portal for a number of resources including customer service, marketing and claims management. in addition, agencies can choose to shift the
ongoing service responsibility for personal insurance's customers to one of the company's five customer care centers, where the company provides, on behalf of an agency, a comprehensive array of
direct customer service needs, including response to billing and coverage inquiries, and policy changes. approximately 1,900 agents take advantage of this service alternative.
personal
insurance also distributes its products through additional channels, including sponsoring organizations such as corporations that make the company's product offerings available
to their employees primarily through payroll deduction, consumer associations and affinity groups. personal insurance handles the sales and service for these programs either through a sponsoring
independent agent or through two of the company's call center locations. in addition, since 1995, the company has had a marketing agreement with geico to underwrite homeowners business for their auto
customers.
in
2009, the company began marketing its insurance products directly to consumers, largely through online channels. the investment in the direct-to-consumer
initiative generated modest growth in premium volume for personal insurance in 2009, 2010 and 2011, which was consistent with the company's expectations. however, the
direct-to-consumer initiative, while intended to enhance the company's long-term ability to compete successfully in a consumer-driven marketplace, is expected to
remain unprofitable for a number of years as this business grows and matures.
pricing and underwriting
personal insurance has developed a product management methodology that integrates the disciplines of underwriting, claim, actuarial and
product development. this approach is designed to maintain high quality underwriting discipline and pricing segmentation. proprietary data accumulated over many years is analyzed, and personal
insurance uses a variety of proprietary and vendor produced risk differentiation models to facilitate its pricing segmentation. the company's product management area establishes underwriting
guidelines integrated with its filed pricing and rating plans, which enable personal insurance to execute its risk selection and pricing processes.
pricing
for personal automobile insurance is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and by inflation in the cost of automobile repairs, medical care and litigation of
liability claims. as a result, the profitability of the business is largely dependent on promptly identifying and responding to disparities between premium levels and projected claim costs, and
obtaining approval from state regulatory authorities when necessary for filed rate changes.
pricing
in the homeowners business is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and by inflation in the cost of building supplies, labor and household possessions. in
addition to the normal risks associated with any multiple peril coverage, the profitability and pricing of homeowners insurance is affected by the incidence of natural disasters, particularly those
related to weather and earthquakes. changes to methods of marketing and underwriting in some jurisdictions are subject to state-imposed restrictions, which can make it more difficult for an insurer to
significantly manage catastrophe exposures.
personal
insurance utilizes technology to maximize independent agents' ease of doing business with the company. automated quote transactions can be submitted online by independent agents
either through personal insurance's proprietary platform, their own agency management platform or comparative raters (discussed in more detail in the "competition" section that follows). nearly all
new business policies can be issued online either by using the agents' own platform or personal insurance's platform, both of which interface with personal insurance's underwriting and rating systems
to monitor
table of contents
transactions
for compliance with the company's underwriting and pricing programs. all online business is subject to consultative review by personal insurance's in-house underwriters, and
audits are conducted by an internal peer review team across all of the company's independent agency-generated business on a systematic sampling basis.
insurers
writing personal lines property and casualty policies may be unable to increase prices until some time after the costs associated with coverage have increased, primarily because
of state insurance rate regulation. the pace at which an insurer can change rates in response to increased costs depends, in part, on whether the applicable state law requires prior approval of rate
increases or notification to the regulator either before or after a rate change is imposed. in states with prior approval laws, rates must be approved by the regulator before being used by the
insurer. in states having "file-and-use" laws, the insurer must file rate changes with the regulator, but does not need to wait for approval before using the new rates. a
"use-and-file" law requires an insurer to file rates within a period of time after the insurer begins using the new rate. approximately one-half of the states
require prior approval of most rate changes. the company's ability or willingness to raise prices, modify underwriting terms or reduce exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to
considerations of public policy, the evolving political environment, changes in the general economic climate and/or social responsibilities. the company also may choose to write business it might not
otherwise write for strategic purposes, such as improving access to other underwriting opportunities.
product lines
the primary coverages in personal insurance are personal automobile and homeowners and other insurance sold to individuals. personal
insurance had approximately 7.8million active policies (e.g.,policies-in-force) at december31, 2011.
the
personal insurance segment writes the following types of coverages:
personal automobile provides coverage for liability to others for both
bodily injury and property damage, uninsured motorist protection, and for physical damage to an insured's own vehicle from collision. in addition, many states require policies to provide first-party
personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.
homeowners and other provides protection against losses to dwellings and
contents from a variety of perils (excluding flooding) as well as coverage for personal liability. the company writes homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and tenants, and rental
properties. the company writes coverage for boats and yachts and valuable personal items such as jewelry, and also writes coverages for umbrella liability, identity fraud, and weddings and special
events.
net retention policy
the following discussion reflects the company's retention policy with respect to the personal insurance segment as of january1,
2012. the company generally retains its primary personal auto exposures in their entirety. for personal property insurance, there is an $8.0million maximum retention per risk. personal
insurance retains the first $10.0million of umbrella policies and purchases facultative reinsurance for limits over $10.0million. the company utilizes facultative reinsurance to
provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. the company may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual
characteristics of the risk.

competition
although national companies write the majority of this business, personal insurance also faces competition from many regional and
hundreds of local companies. personal insurance primarily competes based on service, ease of doing business, price, stability of the insurer and name recognition. personal insurance competes for
business within each independent agency since these agencies also offer policies of competing companies. at the agency level, competition is primarily based on the level of service, including claims
handling, the level of automation and the development of long-term relationships with individual agents, as well as on price. in recent years, many independent personal insurance agents
have begun utilizing price comparison rating technology, sometimes referred to as "comparative raters," as a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple companies. comparative
raters tend to put additional focus on price over other competitive criteria. personal insurance also competes with insurance companies that use exclusive agents or salaried employees to sell their
products, as well as those that employ direct marketing strategies, including the use of toll-free numbers and the internet. personal insurance believes that its continued focus on
underwriting and pricing segmentation, claim settlement effectiveness strategies and expense management practices enables it to price its products competitively in all of its distribution channels.
claims management
the company's claim functions are managed through its claims services operation, with locations in the united states and in the
countries where it does business. with more than 13,000 employees, claims services employs a diverse group of professionals, including claim adjusters, appraisers, attorneys, investigators, engineers,
accountants, system specialists and training, management and support personnel. approved external service providers, such as independent adjusters and appraisers, investigators and attorneys, are
available for use as appropriate.
table of contents
u.s. field claim management teams located in 21 claim centers and 60 satellite and specialty-only offices in 46 states are organized to maintain focus
on the specific claim characteristics unique to the businesses within the company's business segments. claim teams with specialized skills, required licenses, resources and workflows are matched to
the unique exposures of those businesses, with local claims management dedicated to achieving optimal results within each segment. the company's home office operations provide additional support in
the form of workflow design, quality management, information technology, advanced management information and data analysis, training, financial reporting and control, and human resources strategy.
this structure permits the company to maintain the economies of scale of a large, established company while retaining the agility to respond promptly to the needs of customers, brokers, agents and
underwriters. claims management for international is generally provided locally by staff in the respective international locations due to local knowledge of applicable laws and regulations, although
it is also managed by the company's u.s. claims services organization to leverage that knowledge base and to share best practices.
an
integral part of the company's strategy to benefit customers and shareholders is its continuing industry leadership in the fight against insurance fraud through its investigative
services unit. the company has a nationwide staff of experts that investigate a wide array of insurance fraud schemes using in-house forensic resources and other technological tools. this
staff also has specialized expertise in fire scene examinations, medical provider fraud schemes and data mining. the company also dedicates investigative resources to ensure that violations of law are
reported to and prosecuted by law enforcement agencies.
claims
services uses technology, management information and data analysis to assist the company in reviewing its claim practices and results in order to evaluate and improve its claims
management performance. the company's claims management strategy is focused on segmentation of claims and appropriate technical specialization to drive effective claim resolution. the company
continually monitors its investment in claim resources to maintain an effective focus on claim outcomes and a disciplined approach to continual improvement. the company operates a
state-of-the-art claims training facility, offering hands-on experiential learning to help ensure that its claim professionals are properly trained. in
recent years, the company has invested significant additional resources in many of its claim handling operations and routinely monitors the effect of those investments to ensure a consistent
optimization among outcomes, cost and service.
in
recent years, claims services refined its catastrophe response strategy to increase the company's ability to respond to a significant catastrophic event using its own personnel,
enabling it to minimize reliance on independent adjustors and appraisers. the company has developed a large dedicated catastrophe response team and trained a large enterprise response team of existing
employees who can be deployed on short notice in the event of a catastrophe that generates claim volume exceeding the capacity of the dedicated catastrophe response team. in recent years, these
internal resources were successfully deployed to respond to a record number of catastrophe claims.
reinsurance
the company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. the company cedes to reinsurers
a portion of these risks and pays premiums based upon the risk and exposure of the policies subject to such reinsurance. ceded reinsurance involves credit risk, except with regard to mandatory pools
and associations, and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits. although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the company remains liable as the direct
insurer on all risks reinsured. reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts. the company also holds collateral,
including trust agreements, escrow funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. the company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its
reinsurance arrangements periodically. reinsurers are selected based on
table of contents
their
financial condition, business practices, the price of their product offerings and the value of collateral provided. after reinsurance is purchased, the company has limited ability to manage the
credit risk to a reinsurer. in addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the european union
and the united kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the
transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority. for additional information concerning reinsurance, see note5 of notes to the company's consolidated financial
statements and "item1arisk factors."
the
company utilizes a variety of reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to large property and casualty losses, including:
facultative reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for all or a portion of the insurance provided by a single
policy and each policy reinsured is separately negotiated;
quota share reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for an agreed-upon fixed percentage of liabilities,
premiums and losses for each policy covered on a pro rata basis;
treaty reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for a specified type or category of risks; and
catastrophe reinsurance, in which the company is indemnified for an amount of loss in excess of a specified retention with
respect to losses resulting from a catastrophic event.
for
a description of reinsurance-related litigation, see note15 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
included
in reinsurance recoverables are certain amounts related to structured settlements, which comprise annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain
personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the
life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the company's consolidated balance sheet as a liability and as a reinsurance recoverable, as the company retains the
contingent liability to the claimant. in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the
company would be required to make such payments, if and to the extent the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations.
catastrophe reinsurance
catastrophes can be caused by a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes,
hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods and volcanic eruptions. catastrophes can also result from a terrorist attack (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological
events), explosions, infrastructure failures or as a consequence of political instability. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. the extent of losses from a
catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas;
however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those areas that are heavily populated. the company generally seeks to manage its exposure to
catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. the company utilizes a general catastrophe reinsurance treaty with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage its
exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes. in addition to the coverage provided under this treaty, the company also utilizes a catastrophe bond program, as well as a northeast catastrophe
reinsurance treaty, to protect against certain losses resulting from catastrophes in the northeastern united states.
general catastrophe reinsurance treaty.the general catastrophe reinsurance treaty covers the accumulation of net property losses
arising out of one
occurrence. the treaty covers all of the
table of contents
company's
exposures in the united states and canada and their possessions, and waters contiguous thereto, the caribbean and mexico. the treaty only provides coverage for terrorism events in limited
circumstances and excludes entirely losses arising from nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.

catastrophe bond program.on december18, 2009, longpoint re ii,ltd. (longpoint re ii), a newly formed independent cayman
islands
insurance company, successfully completed an offering to unrelated investors of $500million aggregate principal amount of catastrophe bonds. in connection with the offering, the company and
longpoint re ii entered into two reinsurance agreements (covering a three-year and four-year period, respectively), each providing up to $250million of reinsurance on a
proportional basis from losses resulting from certain hurricane events in the northeastern united states.
under
the terms of these reinsurance agreements, the company is obligated to pay annual reinsurance premiums to longpoint re ii for the reinsurance coverage. the reinsurance agreements
utilize a dual trigger that is based upon the company's covered losses incurred and an index that is created by applying predetermined percentages to insured industry losses in each state in the
covered area as reported by a third-party service provider. the reinsurance agreements meet the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the guidance for reinsurance
contracts. amounts payable to the company under the reinsurance agreements with respect to any covered event will be determined by the index-based losses from such event (which are designed to
approximate the company's actual losses), but cannot exceed the company's actual losses from such event. the company's actual loss experience may differ from the index-based losses. the principal
amount of the
catastrophe bonds will be reduced by any amounts paid to the company under the reinsurance agreements.
the
attachment point for the index-based losses and the maximum limit are reset annually to maintain modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss on the respective catastrophe
bonds equal to the initial modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss. the two reinsurance agreements provide protection for covered events occurring before or on december18, 2012
and december18, 2013, respectively. in accordance with the longpoint re ii program, the index-based losses attachment point was reset on may1, 2011. for the period may1, 2011
through april30, 2012,
table of contents
the
company will be entitled to begin recovering amounts under the two reinsurance agreements if the index-based losses in the covered area for a single occurrence reach an initial attachment amount
of $2.208billion. the full $250million coverage amount of each agreement is available on a proportional basis until index-based losses reach a maximum $2.793billion limit. the
company has not incurred any losses that have resulted or are expected to result in a recovery under the longpoint re ii agreements since their inception. for the period may1, 2012 through
april30, 2013, the attachment point for the index-based losses and the maximum limit will be based on the new version of the third-party proprietary computer model used to estimate potential
hurricane losses for the entire industry, discussed in "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscatastrophe
modeling." the company has not yet determined the state weightings for the may1, 2012 reset. however, it is estimated that the attachment point for the index-based losses and the maximum limit
on the reinsurance agreements in the longpoint re ii program will increase by as much as 70%, reflecting increases in the third-party model's industry estimate of covered losses. the company regularly
reviews its catastrophe reinsurance coverage and may seek additional catastrophe reinsurance coverage, either through general catastrophe reinsurance or through catastrophe bonds, to provide
protection against the higher potential retention of catastrophe losses resulting from the expected increase in the attachment point.
as
with any reinsurance agreement, there is credit risk associated with collecting amounts due from reinsurers. with regard to longpoint re ii, the credit risk is mitigated by two
reinsurance trust accounts, one for each agreement. each reinsurance trust account has been funded by longpoint re ii with money market funds that invest solely in direct government obligations backed
by the u.s. government with maturities of no more than 13months. the money market funds must have a principal stability rating of at least aaam by standard& poor's. other permissible
investments include repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by direct government obligations backed by the u.s. government with terms of no more than 397 calendar days, and cash.
at
the time the agreements were entered into with longpoint re ii, the company evaluated the applicability of the accounting guidance that addresses variable interest entities or vies.
under this guidance, an entity that is formed for business purposes is considered a vie if: (a)the equity investors
lack the direct or indirect ability through voting rights or similar rights to make decisions about an entity's activities that have a significant effect on the entity's operations, or (b)the
equity investors do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. additionally, a company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses from a vie's activities
or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's expected residual returns, or both, is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the vie and is required to consolidate the vie in the company's
financial statements.
as
a result of the evaluation of the reinsurance agreement with longpoint re ii, the company concluded that it was a vie because the conditions described in items(a) and
(b)above were present. however, while longpoint re ii was determined to be a vie, the company concluded that it did not have a variable interest in the entity, as the variability in its
results, caused by the reinsurance agreements, is expected to be absorbed entirely by the investors in the catastrophe bonds issued by the longpoint re ii and residual amounts earned by it, if any,
are expected to be absorbed by the equity investors (the company has neither an equity nor a residual interest in longpoint re ii).
accordingly,
the company is not the primary beneficiary of longpoint re ii and does not consolidate that entity in the company's consolidated financial statements. additionally, because
the company has no intention to pursue any transaction that would result in it acquiring interest in and becoming the primary beneficiary of longpoint re ii, the consolidation of that entity in the
company's consolidated financial statements in future periods is unlikely.
northeast catastrophe reinsurance treaty.in addition to its general catastrophe treaty and its multi-year catastrophe bond program, the
company also is party to a northeast general catastrophe
table of contents
treaty
which provides up to $600million of coverage, subject to a $2.25billion retention, for losses arising from hurricanes, earthquakes and winter storm or freeze losses from
virginia to maine for the period july1, 2011 through june30, 2012. losses from a covered event (occurring over several days) anywhere in the united states, canada, the caribbean and
mexico may be used to satisfy the retention. recoveries under the catastrophe bond programs (if any) would be first applied to reduce losses subject to this treaty.
general catastrophe aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty.for the period january1, 2012 to december31,
2012, the company has entered into a reinsurance agreement
that covers the accumulation of net property losses arising both out of one occurrence and out of significant retentions from multiple occurrences. qualifying losses are comprised of various amounts
of retained losses in excess of $100million per event. the treaty provides coverage for 15% of $1.0billion in excess of $1.5billion of qualifying losses. the treaty covers all
of the company's exposures in the united states and canada and their possessions, and waters contiguous thereto, the caribbean and mexico.
earthquake excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty.the company renewed its earthquake excess-of-loss
treaty that provides for up to $142.5million of coverage, subject to a $125million retention, for earthquake losses incurred under policies written by the national property business
unit in the company's business insurance segment for the period july1, 2011 through june30, 2012.
international reinsurance treaties.for business underwritten in canada, the united kingdom and republic of ireland and in the company's
operations
at lloyd's, separate reinsurance protections are purchased locally that have lower net retentions more commensurate with the size of the respective local balance sheet. the company conducts an ongoing
review of its risk and catastrophe coverages and makes changes as it deems appropriate.
terrorism risk insurance program.the terrorism risk insurance program (the program) is a federal program administered by the
department of the
treasury that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest. the
program has been authorized through 2014. for a further description of the program, including the company's estimated deductible under the program in 2012, see note5 of notes to the company's
consolidated financial statements in this annual report and "item1arisk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and
adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance."
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment
expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported.
the
company continually refines its reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process that includes review of key assumptions, underlying variables and historical loss experience. the
company reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the periods in which the estimates are changed. in establishing reserves, the company takes into account estimated recoveries
for reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. the reserves are also reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company. for additional information on the process of estimating reserves and
a discussion of underlying variables and risk factors, see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical
accounting estimates."
the
process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables (discussed by product line in the "critical accounting
estimates" section of "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
table of contents
operations")
are affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial trends and legislative changes, among others. the impact of many of
these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in the
underlying insurance contract (e.g.,claims-made versus occurrence), claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of the
occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the insured event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). informed judgment is applied throughout the
process.
the
company derives estimates for unreported claims and development on reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of historical patterns of loss development by accident year for
each type of exposure and business unit. similarly, the company derives estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses principally from actuarial analyses of historical development patterns of the
relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business and type of exposure. for a description of the company's reserving methods for asbestos and environmental claims, see
"item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsasbestos claims and litigation," and "environmental claims and
litigation."
discounting
the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for most long-term disability and annuity claim payments, primarily
arising from workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies, were discounted to the present value of estimated future payments using a rate of 5% at both
december31, 2011 and 2010. these discounted reserves totaled $2.20billion and $2.09billion at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
claims and claim adjustment expense development table
the table that follows sets forth the year-end reserves from 2001 through 2011 and the subsequent changes in those
reserves, presented on a historical basis. the original estimates, cumulative amounts paid and re-estimated reserves in the table for the years 2001 through 2003 have not been restated to
reflect the acquisition by travelers property casualty corp. (tpc) of the st.paul companies,inc. (spc) in 2004 (referred to hereafter as the merger). the table includes spc reserves
beginning at december31, 2004.
the
data in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the securities and exchange commission (sec). care must be taken to avoid misinterpretation by those
unfamiliar with this information or familiar with other data commonly reported by the insurance industry. the data in the table is not accident year data, but rather a display of 2001 to
2011year-end reserves and the subsequent changes in those reserves.
for
instance, the "cumulative deficiency (redundancy)" shown in the table for each year represents the aggregate amount by which original estimates of reserves as of that
year-end have changed in subsequent years. accordingly, the cumulative deficiency for a year relates only to reserves at that year-end and those amounts are not additive.
expressed another way, if the original reserves at the end of 2001 included $4million for a loss that is finally paid in 2006 for $5million, the $1million deficiency (the
excess of the actual payment of $5million over the original estimate of $4million) would be included in the cumulative deficiencies in each of the years 2001 to 2005 shown in the
accompanying table.
various
factors may distort the re-estimated reserves and cumulative deficiency or redundancy shown in the table. for example, a substantial portion of the cumulative
deficiencies shown in the table arise from claims on policies written prior to the mid-1980s involving liability exposures such as asbestos and environmental claims. in the
post-1984 period, the company has developed more stringent
table of contents
underwriting
standards and policy exclusions and has significantly contracted or terminated the writing of these risks. see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operationsasbestos claims and litigation," and "environmental claims and litigation." general conditions and trends that have affected the
development of these liabilities in the past will not necessarily recur in the future.
other
factors that affect the data in the table include the discounting of certain reserves (as discussed above) and the use of retrospectively rated insurance policies. for example,
reserves for long-term disability and annuity claim payments (tabular reserves), primarily arising from workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies,
are discounted to reflect the time value of money. apparent deficiencies will continue to occur as the discount on these workers' compensation reserves is accreted at the appropriate interest rates.
also, a portion of national accounts business is underwritten with retrospectively rated insurance policies in which the ultimate loss experience is primarily borne by the insured. for this business,
increases in loss experience result in an increase in reserves and an offsetting increase in amounts recoverable from insureds. likewise, decreases in loss experience result in a decrease in reserves
and an offsetting decrease in amounts recoverable from these insureds. the amounts recoverable on these retrospectively rated policies mitigate the impact of the cumulative deficiencies or
redundancies on the company's earnings but are not reflected in the table.
because
of these and other factors, it is difficult to develop a meaningful extrapolation of estimated future redundancies or deficiencies in loss reserves from the data in the table.

for years prior to 2004, the table excludes reserves of spc, which were acquired in the merger on april1, 2004. accordingly, the reserve
development (net reserves for claims and claim adjustment expense re-estimated as of subsequent years less net reserves recorded at the end of the year, as originally estimated) for years
prior to 2004 relates only to losses recorded by tpc and does not include reserve development recorded by spc. for 2004 and subsequent years, the table includes spc reserves acquired and subsequent
development recorded on those reserves. at december31, 2004, spc gross reserves were $23,274million, and net reserves were $15,959million.
in
december 2008, the company completed the sale of unionamerica holdings limited (unionamerica), which comprised its united kingdom (u.k.)-based runoff insurance and reinsurance
businesses. (unionamerica was acquired in 2004 as part of the merger.) immediately before the sale, the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves of unionamerica totaled $790million. as a
result of the sale, those obligations ceased being the responsibility of the company and its affiliates. the sale is reflected in the table as a reduction in december31, 2008 net reserves of
$790million and as a $790million increase in paid losses for each of the years 2004 through 2007 to reflect the transfer (payment) of the reserves to the buyer, resulting in no impact
to incurred losses.

reserves on statutory accounting basis
at december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (net of reinsurance) shown in the preceding
table, which are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap reserves), were $20million, $20million and $18million higher, respectively,
than those reported in the company's respective annual reports filed with insurance regulators, which are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices (statutory reserves).
the
differences between gaap and statutory reserves are primarily due to the differences in gaap and statutory accounting for two items, (1)fees associated with billing of
required reimbursements under large deductible business, and (2)the accounting for retroactive reinsurance. for large deductible business, the company pays the deductible portion of a casualty
insurance claim and then seeks reimbursement from the insured, plus a fee. this fee is reported as fee income for gaap reporting, but as an offset to claim expenses paid for statutory reporting.
retroactive reinsurance balances result from reinsurance placed to cover losses on insured events occurring prior to the inception of a reinsurance contract. for gaap reporting, retroactive
reinsurance balances are included in reinsurance recoverables and result in lower net reserve amounts. statutory accounting practices require retroactive reinsurance balances to be recorded in other
liabilities as contra-liabilities rather than in loss reserves.
asbestos and environmental claims
asbestos and environmental claims are segregated from other claims and are handled separately by the company's special liability group,
a separate unit staffed by dedicated legal, claim, finance and engineering professionals. for additional information on asbestos and environmental claims, see "item7management's
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsasbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation."
intercompany reinsurance pooling arrangements
most of the company's insurance subsidiaries are members of an intercompany property and casualty reinsurance pooling arrangement.
pooling arrangements permit the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool's policyholders' surplus rather than just on its own policyholder surplus. under such arrangements,
the members share substantially all insurance business that is written and allocate the combined premiums, losses and expenses.
ratings
ratings are an important factor in assessing the company's competitive position in the insurance industry. the company receives ratings
from the following major rating agencies:a.m. best company (a.m.best), fitch ratings (fitch), moody's investors service (moody's) and standard& poor's corp. (s&p). rating
agencies typically issue two types of ratings for insurance companies: claims-paying (or
table of contents
financial
strength) ratings which reflect the rating agency's assessment of an insurer's ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders and debt ratings which reflect the rating agency's
assessment of a company's prospects for repaying its debts and are considered by lenders in connection with the setting of interest rates and terms for a company's short- and long-term
borrowings. agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and they may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. each agency's rating should be evaluated
independently of any other agency's rating. the system and the number of rating categories can vary widely from rating agency to rating agency. customers usually focus on claims-paying ratings, while
creditors focus on debt ratings. investors use both to evaluate a company's overall financial strength. the ratings issued on the company or its subsidiaries by any of these agencies are announced
publicly and are available on the company's website and from the agencies.
a
downgrade in one or more of the company's claims-paying ratings could negatively impact the company's business volumes and competitive position because demand for certain of its
products may be reduced, particularly because many customers require that the company maintain minimum ratings to enter into or renew business with it.
additionally,
a downgrade in one or more of the company's debt ratings could adversely impact the company's ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds, including in
the syndicated bank loan market, and/or result in higher financing costs. for example, downgrades in the company's debt ratings could result in higher interest expense under the company's revolving
credit agreement (under which the cost of borrowing could range from libor plus 100 basis points to libor plus 175 basis points, depending on the company's debt ratings), the company's commercial
paper program, or in the event that the company were to access the capital markets by issuing debt or similar types of securities. see "item7"management's discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources" for a discussion of the company's revolving credit agreement and commercial paper program. the company considers the
level of increased cash funding requirements in the event of a ratings downgrade as part of the evaluation of the company's liquidity requirements. the company currently believes that a
one- to two-notch downgrade in its debt ratings would not result in a material increase in interest expense under its existing credit agreement and commercial paper programs.
in addition, the company considers the impact of a ratings downgrade as part of the evaluation of its common share repurchases.

investment operations
the majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid taxable u.s.
government, tax-exempt u.s.
municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds. the company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and the company's investment purchases and sales are
executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy its insurance and debt obligations. generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the company's fixed
maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company's insurance reserves. the company's management of the duration of the fixed maturity investment portfolio has historically
produced a duration that exceeds the estimated duration of the company's net insurance liabilities. recently, the estimated average effective duration of the company's portfolio of fixed maturity and
short-term security investments has declined, primarily due to the impact of declining market yields and tightening investment spreads on existing holdings of mortgage-backed securities
(both of which impact the assumptions related to optional pre-payments), an increase in pre-refunded municipal bonds and general portfolio management decisions. the company has
also recently experienced an increase in the estimated average effective duration of its net insurance liabilities, primarily reflecting the impact of declining market interest rates, as well as an
increase in workers' compensation insurance business volume. as a result, the estimated average effective duration of the company's net insurance liabilities exceeded that of its portfolio of fixed
maturity and short-term security investments at december31, 2011. the substantial amount by which the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the expected present value
of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the company's ability to fund claim
payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.
the
company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships, real estate and insurance
joint ventures, mortgage loans, venture capital (through direct ownership and limited partnerships) and trading securities. these investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also
involve varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.

regulation
u.s. state and federal regulation
trv's insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the various states and jurisdictions in which they transact business. the
extent of regulation varies, but generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state. the regulation,
supervision and administration relate, among other things, to standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on
investments, premium rates, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of
securities for the benefit of policyholders, approval of policy forms and the regulation of market conduct, including the use of credit information in underwriting as well as other underwriting and
claims practices. in addition, many states have enacted variations of competitive
ratemaking laws, which allow insurers to set certain premium rates for certain classes of insurance without having to obtain the prior approval of the state insurance department. state insurance
departments also conduct periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of insurance companies and require the filing of financial and other reports on a quarterly and annual
basis. state insurance regulation continues to evolve in response to the changing economic and business environment as well as efforts by regulators internationally to develop a consistent approach to
regulations. these changes are evidenced by the recent changes that the states have made to provide greater emphasis on understanding an insurer's corporate governance and control environment,
including enterprise risk management (erm), in conducting financial examinations. additional requirements are also expected. for example, the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) is
considering an own risk and solvency assessment (orsa) requirement, which if adopted by states would require insurers to perform an orsa and, upon
request, file an orsa report that describes for the regulators the erm process used by an insurer. see "enterprise risk management" herein for further discussion of the company's erm. trv's insurance
subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact insurance business in all u.s. states, the district of columbia, guam, puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands.
although
the u.s. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, in 2010 the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the
dodd-frank act) established a federal insurance office within the u.s. department of the treasury. the federal insurance office has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather
data and information regarding the insurance industry and insurers, including conducting a study for submission to the u.s. congress on how to modernize and improve insurance regulation in the u.s.
further, the dodd-frank act gives the federal reserve supervisory authority over a number of nonbank financial services holding companies, including insurance companies, if they are
designated by a two-thirds vote of a financial stability oversight council (the council) as "systemically important financial institutions" (sifi). while recent rules proposed by the
council support the company's view that it will not be designated as a sifi as defined in the dodd-frank act, it is possible that the council may change its rules or interpretations in the
future and conclude that the company is a sifi. if the company were designated as "systemically important," the federal reserve's supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened
financial regulation and could impact requirements regarding the company's capital, liquidity and leverage as well as its business and investment conduct. as a result of the foregoing, the
dodd-frank act, or other additional state and federal regulation that is adopted in the future, could impose significant burdens on the company, including impacting the ways in which it
conducts its business, increasing compliance costs and duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive disadvantage, particularly relative to smaller insurers that may not be subject
to the same level of regulation.
insurance regulation concerning dividends from insurance subsidiaries.trv's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the
state of
connecticut. the connecticut insurance holding company laws
table of contents
require
notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend from an insurance subsidiary that, together with other distributions made within the
preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurance subsidiary's policyholders' surplus as of the preceding december31, or the insurance subsidiary's net income for the
twelve-month period ending the preceding december31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. this declaration or payment is further
limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.
the
insurance holding company laws of other states in which trv's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive,
limitations on the payment of dividends.
rate and rule approvals.trv's insurance subsidiaries are subject to each state's laws and regulations regarding rate and rule
approvals. the
applicable laws and regulations are used by states to establish standards to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition. an
insurer's ability to increase rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each respective state's requirements.
requirements for exiting geographic markets and/or canceling or nonrenewing policies.several states have laws and regulations which
may impact the
timing and/or the ability of an insurer to either discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in that state. these laws and regulations typically require prior notice, and in some instances
insurance department approval, prior to discontinuing a line of business or withdrawing from that state, and they allow insurers to cancel or non-renew certain policies only for certain
specified reasons.
assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling and reinsurance arrangements.virtually all states
require
insurers licensed to do business in their state, including trv's insurance subsidiaries, to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some claimants because of the insolvency of other insurers. many
states also have laws that establish second-injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury.
trv's
insurance subsidiaries are also required to participate in various involuntary assigned risk pools, principally involving workers' compensation, automobile insurance, property
windpools in states prone
to property damage from hurricanes, and fair plans, which provide various insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage in the voluntary
market.
assessments
may include any charge mandated by statute or regulatory authority that is related directly or indirectly to underwriting activities. examples of such mechanisms include, but
are not limited to, the florida hurricane catastrophe fund, florida citizens property insurance corporation, louisiana citizens property insurance corporation, and the texas windstorm insurance
association. amounts payable or paid as a result of arrangements that are in substance reinsurance, including certain involuntary pools where insurers are required to assume premiums and losses from
those pools, are accounted for as reinsurance (e.g.,national workers compensation reinsurance pool, north carolina beach plan). amounts related to assessments from arrangements that are not
reinsurance are reported as a component of "general and administrative expenses." for additional information concerning assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other mandatory
pooling and reinsurance agreements including state-funding mechanisms, see item1a"risk factors."
insurance regulatory information system.the naic developed the insurance regulatory information system (iris) to help state regulators
identify
companies that may require special attention. financial examiners review annual statements and key financial ratios based on year-end data. these ratios assist state insurance departments
in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. each ratio has an established "usual range" of results.
table of contents
a
ratio result falling outside the usual range of iris ratios, however, is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system.
furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. generally, an insurance company will become subject to
regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges of four or more of the ratios.
based
on preliminary 2011 iris ratios calculated by the company for its lead insurance subsidiaries, the travelers indemnity company and st.paul fire and marine insurance company
had results outside the normal range for one iris ratio due to the size of their investments in non-fixed maturity securities. travelers casualty and surety company and the standard fire
insurance company had results outside the normal range for two iris ratios due to the amount of dividends paid to their respective parent. additionally, travelers casualty and surety company had
results outside the normal range for one iris ratio due to the amount of dividends received from its subsidiaries.
in
2010, the following lead insurance subsidiaries had results outside the normal range due to the actions taken by the company during 2010 to dividend excess capital to the holding
company: the travelers indemnity company had results outside the normal range for one iris ratio due to the amount of dividends received from its subsidiaries and for three iris ratios due to the
amount of dividends paid to its parent; travelers casualty and surety company and the standard fire insurance company had results outside the normal range for one iris ratio due to the amount of
dividends received from their subsidiaries and for two iris ratios due to the amount of dividends paid to their parent; and st.paul fire and marine insurance company had results outside the
normal range for three iris ratios due to the amount of dividends paid to its parent.
management
does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2011 iris ratio results for the lead insurance subsidiaries or their insurance subsidiaries. in all instances in prior
years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required.
risk-based capital (rbc) requirements.the naic has an rbc requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies. the rbc
requirement determines minimum capital requirements and is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. under laws adopted by individual states, insurers having total
adjusted capital less than that required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy.
the
formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital above the rbc requirement. therefore, it is inappropriate
and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. at december31, 2011, all of trv's insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the rbc requirement.
investment regulation.insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality
and
concentration of investments. in general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage
loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications. at december31, 2011, the company was in compliance with these laws and
regulations.
international regulation
trv's insurance underwriting subsidiaries based in the united kingdom, travelers insurance company limited and travelers casualty and
surety company of europe limited, are regulated by the financial services authority (fsa). the fsa's principal objectives are to maintain market confidence, promote public understanding of the
financial system, protect consumers, and fight financial crime. trv's managing agency (travelers syndicate managementltd.) of its lloyd's syndicate is also
table of contents
regulated
by the fsa, which has delegated certain regulatory responsibilities to the council of lloyd's. the fsa will be merged into the bank of england during 2012.
through
lloyd's, trv is licensed to write business in over 75 countries throughout the world by virtue of lloyd's international licenses. in each such country, trv's managing agency, as
part of lloyd's, is subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country. in addition, trv's lloyd's managing agency has an underwriting agency and a service company in singapore, the
operations of which are regulated by the monetary authority of singapore. a trv subsidiary, travelers casualty and surety company, has a representative office in china. the representative office is
regulated by the china insurance regulatory commission. a trv subsidiary, tci global services,inc., has a liaison office in india. insurance business in india is regulated by the insurance
regulatory and development authority.
trv's
insurance operations in the republic of ireland are regulated by the insurance supervision departments of the central bank of ireland. such operations are conducted through an
irish branch of travelers insurance company limited which, as mentioned above, is regulated by the fsa. in canada, the conduct of trv's insurance business is regulated by the office of the
superintendent of financial institutions under provisions of the insurance companies act. trv has an interest in jmalucelli, a joint venture holding company in brazil. jmalucelli's subsidiaries
operate in the insurance and reinsurance business in brazil and are regulated by the superintendencia de seguros privados.
regulators
require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on the type and amount of insurance policies in-force.
the
european union's executive body, the european commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called solvency ii that would apply to the company's
businesses across the european union beginning as soon as the first quarter of 2013. however, the european parliament has scheduled a vote in 2012 on whether to delay the implementation date. under
solvency ii, it is possible that the u.s. parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary's capital position
is dependent on the parent company and the u.s. company is not already subject to regulations deemed "equivalent" to solvency ii. in addition, regulators in countries where the company has operations
are working with the international association of insurance supervisors (and in the u.s., with the naic) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including group supervision. while it is
not certain how or if these actions will impact the company, it does not currently expect the capital management strategies for its u.s. operating companies or its european union operating companies
will be materially impacted.
insurance holding company statutes
as a holding company, trv is not regulated as an insurance company. however, since trv owns capital stock in insurance subsidiaries, it
is subject to state insurance holding company statutes, as well as certain other laws, of each of its insurance subsidiaries' states of domicile. all holding company statutes, as well as other laws,
require disclosure and, in some instances, prior approval of material transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate. the holding company statutes and other laws also require, among other
things, prior approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer, some transactions between affiliates and the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions.
insurance regulations concerning change of control.many state insurance regulatory laws contain provisions that require advance
approval by state
agencies of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled, or, in some cases, having substantial business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled, in that state.
table of contents
the
laws of many states also contain provisions requiring pre-notification to state agencies prior to any change in control of a non-domestic insurance company
admitted to transact business in that state. while these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, they do authorize issuance of
cease and desist
orders with respect to the non-domestic insurer if it is determined that some conditions, such as undue market concentration, would result from the acquisition.
any
transactions that would constitute a change in control of any of trv's insurance subsidiaries would generally require prior approval by the insurance departments of the states in
which the insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or commercially domiciled. they may also require pre-acquisition notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition
notification provisions and in which such insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business.
two
of trv's insurance subsidiaries and its operations at lloyd's are domiciled in the united kingdom. insurers in the united kingdom are subject to change of control restrictions in the
financial services and markets act of 2000 including approval of the fsa. some of trv's other insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in, or authorized to conduct insurance business in, canada.
authorized insurers in canada are subject to change of control restrictions in section407 of the insurance companies act, including approval of the office of the superintendent of financial
institutions.
these
requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the ownership of common stock, including transactions that could be advantageous to trv's
shareholders.
enterprise risk management
as a large property and casualty insurance enterprise, the company is exposed to many risks. these risks are a function of the
environments within which the company operates. since certain risks can be correlated with other risks, an event or a series of events can impact multiple areas of the company simultaneously and have
a material effect on the company's results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. these exposures require an entity-wide view of risk and an understanding of the potential
impact on all aspects of the company's operations. it also requires the company to manage its risk-taking to be within its risk appetite in a prudent and balanced effort to create and
preserve value for all of the company's stakeholders. this approach to company-wide risk evaluation and management is commonly called enterprise risk management (erm). erm activities
involve both the identification and assessment of a broad range of risks and the execution of synchronized strategies to effectively manage such risks. effective erm also includes the determination of
the company's risk capital needs, which takes into account regulatory requirements and credit rating considerations, in addition to economic and other factors.
erm
at the company is an integral part of business operations. all risk owners across all functions, all corporate leaders and the board of directors are engaged in erm. erm involves
risk-based analytics, as well as reporting and feedback throughout the enterprise in support of the company's long-term financial strategies and objectives.
the
company uses various methods, including sophisticated computer modeling processes, to analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with them. these analyses and methods are
used in making underwriting and reinsurance decisions as part of managing the company's exposure to catastrophic events. in addition to catastrophe modeling and analysis, the company also models and
analyzes its exposure to other extreme events. these analytical techniques are an integral component of the company's erm process and further support the company's long-term financial
strategies and objectives.
in
addition to the day-to-day erm activities within the company's business units, other key internal risk management functions include the management committee
(comprised of the company's
table of contents
chief
executive officer and the other most senior members of management), the enterprise and underwriting risk committees of management, the credit committee, the chief compliance officer, the
business conduct officer, the corporate actuarial group, the corporate audit group, the accounting policy group, the enterprise underwriting group and many others. a senior executive oversees the erm
process. the mission of this executive is to facilitate risk assessment and to collaborate in implementing effective risk management strategies throughout the company. another strategic erm objective
of this executive includes working across the company to enhance effective and realistic risk modeling capabilities as part of the company's overall effort to understand and manage its portfolio of
risks to be within its risk appetite. board oversight of erm is provided by the risk committee of the board of directors, which reviews the strategies, processes and controls pertaining to the
company's insurance operations and oversees the implementation, execution and performance of the company's erm program.
the
company's erm efforts build upon the foundation of an effective internal control environment. erm expands the internal control objectives of effective and efficient operations,
reliable financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to fostering, leading and supporting an integrated, risk-based culture within the company that focuses on
value creation and preservation. however, the company can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that these objectives will be met. further, the design of any risk management or control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. as a result, the possibility of material financial loss remains in spite
of the company's significant erm efforts. an investor should carefully consider the risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report, including the discussions included in
"item1arisk factors," "item7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk," and "item8financial statements and
supplementary data."
other information
customer concentration
in the opinion of the company's management, no material part of the business of the company and its subsidiaries is dependent upon a
single customer or group of customers, the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the company, and no one customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for 10% or more
of the company's consolidated revenues.
employees
at december31, 2011, the company had approximately 30,600 employees. the company believes that its employee relations are
satisfactory. none of the company's employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

glossary of selected insurance terms
accident year
the annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.
adjusted unassigned surplus
unassigned surplus as of the most recent statutory annual report reduced by twenty-five percent of that year's
unrealized appreciation in value or revaluation of assets or unrealized profits on investments, as defined in that report.
admitted insurer
a company licensed to transact insurance business within a state.
agent
a licensed individual who sells and services insurance policies, receiving a commission from the insurer for
selling the business and a fee for servicing it. an independent agent represents multiple insurance companies and searches the market for the best product for its client.
annuity
a contract that pays a periodic benefit over the remaining life of a person (the annuitant), the lives of two or
more persons or for a specified period of time.
table of contents
assigned risk pools
reinsurance pools which cover risks for those unable to purchase insurance in the voluntary market. possible reasons for this
inability include the risk being too great or the profit being too small under the required insurance rate structure. the costs of the risks associated with these pools are charged back to insurance carriers in proportion to their direct
writings.
assumed reinsurance
insurance risks acquired from a ceding company.
average value analysis
a conventional actuarial method used to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an
accident year/product line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the unpaid losses.
the basic premise of the method is that average claim values are stable and predictable over time for a
particular cohort of claims. the method is utilized most often where ultimate claim counts are known or reliably estimable fairly early after the start of an accident year and average values are expected to be fairly predictable from one year to the
next.
the method comes up with an estimate of ultimate claims counts by accident year cohort, and multiplies it by an
estimate of average claim value by accident year cohort, with multiple methods used to estimate these average claim values.
book value per share
total common shareholders' equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding.
bornhuetter-ferguson method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an accident
year/product line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the outstanding losses.
the basic premise of the method is that the historical ratio of additional claim activity to earned premium for
a given product line component/age-to-age period is stable and predictable. it implicitly assumes that the actual activity to date for past periods for that cohort is not a credible predictor of future activity for that cohort, or at least is not
credible enough to override the "a priori" assumption as to future activity. it may be applied to either paid or case incurred claim data. it is used most often where the claim data is sparse and/or volatile and for relatively young cohorts with low
volumes and/or data credibility.
to illustrate, the method may assume that the ratio of additional paid losses from the 12 to 24month
period for an accident year is 10% of the original "a priori" expected losses for that accident year. the original "a priori" expected losses are typically based on the original loss ratio assumption for that accident year, with subsequent adjustment
as facts develop.
table of contents
the ultimate losses equal actual activity to date plus the expected values for future periods.
broker
one who negotiates contracts of insurance or reinsurance on behalf of an insured party, receiving a commission
from the insurer or reinsurer for placement and other services rendered.
capacity
the percentage of surplus, or the dollar amount of exposure, that an insurer or reinsurer is willing or able to
place at risk. capacity may apply to a single risk, a program, a line of business or an entire book of business. capacity may be constrained by legal restrictions, corporate restrictions or indirect restrictions.
captive
a closely-held insurance company whose primary purpose is to provide insurance coverage to the company's owners
or their affiliates.
case-incurred development method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an accident
year/product line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the unpaid losses.
the approach is the same as that described in this glossary under the "paid loss development method," but based
on the growth in cumulative case-incurred losses (i.e.,the sum of claim-adjustor incurred estimates for claims in the cohort) rather than paid losses. the basic premise of the method is that cumulative case incurred losses for a given cohort of
claims will grow in a stable, predictable pattern from year-to-year, based on the age of the cohort.
case reserves
claim department estimates of anticipated future payments to be made on each specific individual reported
claim.
casualty insurance
insurance which is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e.,not the
insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured resulting therefrom. it includes, but is not limited to, employers' liability, workers' compensation, public liability, automobile liability, personal liability and aviation liability insurance.
it excludes certain types of losses that by law or custom are considered as being exclusively within the scope of other types of insurance, such as fire or marine.
table of contents
catastrophe
a severe loss, resulting from a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms,
earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods and volcanic eruptions. catastrophes can also result from a terrorist attack (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), explosions, infrastructure
failures or as a consequence of political instability. each catastrophe has unique characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount. their effects are included in net and operating income and claims and claim adjustment
expense reserves upon occurrence. a catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.
catastrophe loss
loss and directly identified loss adjustment expenses from catastrophes.
catastrophe reinsurance
a form of excess of loss reinsurance which, subject to a specified limit, indemnifies the ceding company for the
amount of loss in excess of a specified retention with respect to an accumulation of losses resulting from a catastrophic event. the actual reinsurance document is called a "catastrophe cover." these reinsurance contracts are typically designed to
cover property insurance losses but can be written to cover casualty insurance losses such as from workers' compensation policies.
cede; ceding company
when an insurer reinsures its liability with another insurer or a "cession," it "cedes" business and is referred
to as the "ceding company."
ceded reinsurance
insurance risks transferred to another company as reinsurance. see "reinsurance."
claim
request by an insured for indemnification by an insurance company for loss incurred from an insured
peril.
claim adjustment expenses
see "loss adjustment expenses (lae)."
claims and claim adjustment expenses
see "loss" and "loss adjustment expenses (lae)."
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
see "loss reserves."
cohort

all claims for a given product in a given market for a given accident year would represent a cohort of claims.
commercial multi-peril policies
refers to policies which cover both property and third-party liability exposures.
commutation agreement
an agreement between a reinsurer and a ceding company whereby the reinsurer pays an agreed-upon amount in
exchange for a complete discharge of all obligations, including future obligations, between the parties for reinsurance losses incurred.

the ratio of debt to total capitalization.
table of contents
debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain (loss) on investments
the ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and
losses.
deductible
the amount of loss that an insured retains.
deferred acquisition costs
primarily commissions and premium-related taxes that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of
new contracts and are deferred and amortized to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses when reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap).
deficiency
with regard to reserves for a given liability, a deficiency exists when it is estimated or determined that the
reserves are insufficient to pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. where the deficiency is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of deficiency (or even the finding of whether or not a deficiency exists) may change as
new information becomes available.
demand surge
significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for
those materials and services, commonly as a result of a large catastrophe resulting in significant widespread property damage.
direct written premiums
the amounts charged by an insurer to insureds in exchange for coverages provided in accordance with the terms of
an insurance contract. the amounts exclude the impact of all reinsurance premiums, either assumed or ceded.
earned premiums or premiums earned
that portion of property casualty premiums written that applies to the expired portion of the policy term.
earned premiums are recognized as revenues under both statutory accounting practices (sap) and gaap.
excess liability
additional casualty coverage above a layer of insurance exposures.
excess of loss reinsurance
reinsurance that indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified portion of losses over a specified dollar
amount or "retention."

the regular (voluntary) market. fair plans are set up on a state-by-state basis to cover only those risks in that state. for more information, see "residual market (involuntary business)."
table of contents
fidelity and surety programs
fidelity insurance coverage protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee. surety
is a three-party agreement in which the insurer agrees to pay a third party or make complete an obligation in response to the default, acts or omissions of an insured.
gaap combined ratio
the sum of the loss and lae ratio, the underwriting expense ratio and, where applicable, the ratio of dividends
to policyholders to net premiums earned. a combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. a combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss.
gaap combined ratio excluding incremental impact of direct to consumer initiative
the gaap combined ratio adjusted to exclude the direct, variable impact of the company's direct-to-consumer
initiative in the personal insurance segment.
gross written premiums
the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of
the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.
ground-up analysis
a method to estimate ultimate claim costs for a given cohort of claims such as an accident year/product line
component. it involves analyzing the exposure and claim activity at an individual insured level and then through the use of deterministic or stochastic scenarios and/or simulations, estimating the ultimate losses for those insureds. the total losses
for the cohort are then the sum of the losses for each individual insured.
in practice, the method is sometimes simplified by performing the individual insured analysis only for the
larger insureds, with the costs for the smaller insureds estimated via sampling approaches (extrapolated to the rest of the smaller insured population) or aggregate approaches (using assumptions consistent with the ground-up larger insured
analysis).
guaranteed cost products
an insurance policy where the premiums charged will not be adjusted for actual loss experience during the
covered period.
guaranty fund
a state-regulated mechanism that is financed by assessing insurers doing business in those states. should
insolvencies occur, these funds are available to meet some or all of the insolvent insurer's obligations to policyholders.
holding company liquidity
total cash, short-term invested assets and other readily marketable securities held by the holding
company.
incurred but not reported (ibnr) reserves
reserves for estimated losses and lae that have been incurred but not yet reported to the insurer. this includes
amounts for unreported claims, development on known cases, and re-opened claims.

paid development method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an accident
year/product line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the unpaid losses.
the basic premise of the method is that cumulative paid losses for a given cohort of claims will grow in a
stable, predictable pattern from year-to-year, based on the age of the cohort. these age-to-age growth factors are sometimes called "link ratios."
for example, if cumulative paid losses for a product line xyz for accident year 2004 were $100 as of
december31, 2004 (12months after the start of that accident year), then grew to $120 as of december31, 2005 (24months after the start), the link ratio for that accident year from 12 to 24months would be 1.20. if the link
ratio for other recent accident years from 12 to 24months for that product line were also at or around 1.20, then the method would assume a similar result for the most recent accident year, i.e.,that it too would have its cumulative paid
losses grow 120% from the 12month to 24month valuation.
this is repeated for each age-to-age period into the future until the age-to-age link ratios for future periods
are assumed to be 1.0 (i.e.,the age at which cumulative losses are assumed to have stopped growing).
table of contents
a given accident year's cumulative losses are then projected to ultimate by multiplying current cumulative losses by successive
age-to-age link ratios up to that future age where growth is expected to end. for example, if growth is expected to end at 60months, then the ultimate indication for an accident year with cumulative losses at 12months equals those losses
times a 12 to 24month link ratio, times a 24 to 36month link ratio, times a 36 to 48month link ratio, times a 48 to 60month link ratio.
advanced applications of the method include adjustments for changing conditions during the historical period and
anticipated changes in the future.
policyholders' surplus
as determined under sap, the amount remaining after all liabilities, including loss reserves, are subtracted
from all admitted assets. admitted assets are assets of an insurer prescribed or permitted by a state to be recognized on the statutory balance sheet. policyholders' surplus is also referred to as "surplus" or "statutory surplus" for statutory
accounting purposes.
pool
an organization of insurers or reinsurers through which particular types of risks are underwritten with premiums,
losses and expenses being shared in agreed-upon percentages.
premiums
the amount charged during the year on policies and contracts issued, renewed or reinsured by an insurance
company.
property insurance
insurance that provides coverage to a person or business with an insurable interest in tangible property for
that person's or business's property loss, damage or loss of use.

reinsurance wherein the insurer cedes an agreed-upon fixed percentage of liabilities, premiums and losses for
each policy covered on a pro rata basis.
rates
amounts charged per unit of insurance.
redundancy
with regard to reserves for a given liability, a redundancy exists when it is estimated or determined that the

exists) may change as new information becomes available.
reinstatement premiums

table of contents
renewal premium change
the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes.
renewal rate change
the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, excluding exposure changes.
reported claim development method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate claim counts for a given cohort of claims such as an
accident year/product line component. if the reported-to-date counts are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate counts, the result is an indication of the ibnr counts.
the approach is the same as that described in this glossary under the "paid loss development method", but based
on the growth in cumulative claim counts rather than paid losses. the basic premise of the method is that cumulative claim counts for a given cohort of claims will grow in a stable, predictable pattern from year-to-year, based on the age of the
cohort.
residual market (involuntary business)
insurance market which provides coverage for risks for those unable to purchase insurance in the voluntary
market. possible reasons for this inability include the risks being too great or the profit potential too small under the required insurance rate structure. residual markets are frequently created by state legislation either because of lack of
available coverage such as: property coverage in a windstorm prone area or protection of the accident victim as in the case of workers' compensation. the costs of the residual market are usually charged back to the direct insurance carriers in
proportion to the carriers' voluntary market shares for the type of coverage involved.

s-curve method
a mathematical function which depicts an initial slow change, followed by a rapid change and then ending in a
slow change again. this results in an "s" shaped line when depicted graphically. the actuarial application of these curves fit the reported data to date for a particular cohort of claims to an s-curve to project future activity for that
cohort.
second-injury fund
the employer of an injured, impaired worker is responsible only for the workers' compensation benefit for the
most recent injury; the second-injury fund would cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a prior condition. the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and
self-insureds based on either premiums or losses.
self-insured retentions
that portion of the risk retained by a person for its own account.
servicing carrier
an insurance company that provides, for a fee, various services including policy issuance, claims adjusting and
customer service for insureds in a reinsurance pool.

third-party liability
a liability owed to a claimant (third party) who is not one of the two parties to the insurance contract. insured liability
claims are referred to as third-party claims.
total capitalization
the sum of total shareholders' equity and debt.
treaty reinsurance
the reinsurance of a specified type or category of risks defined in a reinsurance agreement (a "treaty") between
a primary insurer or other reinsured and a reinsurer. typically, in treaty reinsurance, the primary insurer or reinsured is obligated to offer and the reinsurer is obligated to accept a specified portion of all that type or category of risks
originally written by the primary insurer or reinsured.
umbrella coverage
a form of insurance protection against losses in excess of amounts covered by other liability insurance policies
or amounts not covered by the usual liability policies.
unassigned surplus
the undistributed and unappropriated amount of policyholders' surplus.
underwriter

order to charge an appropriate premium for each accepted risk. the underwriter is expected to select business that will produce an average risk of loss no greater than that anticipated for the class of business.
underwriting
the insurer's or reinsurer's process of reviewing applications for insurance coverage, and the decision as to
whether to accept all or part of the coverage and determination of the applicable premiums; also refers to the acceptance of that coverage.
underwriting expense ratio
for sap, it is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred less other income to net written premiums. for gaap,
it is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred reduced by an allocation of fee income and billing and policy fees to net earned premiums.

item1a.risk factors
you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report, including our consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto.
catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to
raise
capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes
can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods and volcanic eruptions.
catastrophes can also be man-made, such as a terrorist attack (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), explosions, infrastructure failures or a
consequence of political instability. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposures in the united states, which include, but are not limited
to: hurricanes from maine through texas; tornadoes throughout the central, mid-atlantic and southeastern regions of the united states; earthquakes in california, the new madrid region and
the pacific northwest region of north america; wildfires, particularly in the southwest; and terrorism in major cities in the united states. in addition, our international operations subject us to
catastrophe exposures in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of ireland, as well as to a variety of world-wide catastrophe exposures through our lloyd's operations.
the
incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that both the frequency and severity of natural and man-made catastrophic events
could increase. some scientists believe that in recent years changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world and created
additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. for example, in recent years hurricane activity has impacted areas further inland than previously experienced, thus expanding our overall
hurricane exposure. additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornadoes and hail storms have increased, especially in 2011.
all
of the catastrophe modeling tools that we use, or that we rely on from outside parties, to help manage certain of our catastrophe exposures are based on assumptions and judgments
that are subject to error and mis-estimation and may produce estimates that are materially different than actual results. in addition, compared to models for hurricanes and earthquakes,
models for tornadoes and hail storms are newer, less reliable (given the even greater difficulty of predicting the risks), not as extensively tested and used on a much more limited basis by us and the
industry. further, changes in climate conditions could cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively evaluate and manage catastrophe risk. see "we
may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results" below as well as "item7management's discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operationscatastrophe modeling" and "changing climate conditions."
the
extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. increases in the value
and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future. for example, the specific geographic
location impacted by tornadoes is inherently random and unpredictable and the specific location impacted by a tornado may or may not be highly populated and may or may not have a high concentration of
our insured exposures. in addition, states have from time to time passed legislation, and regulators have taken action, that has the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe
risk, such as legislation prohibiting insurers from reducing exposures or withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas or mandating that insurers participate in residual markets. participation in residual
market mechanisms has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant losses or assessments to insurers, including us, and, in certain states, those losses or assessments may not be
commensurate with our direct catastrophe exposure in
table of contents
those
states. if our competitors leave those states having residual market mechanisms, remaining insurers, including us, may be subject to significant increases in losses or assessments following a
catastrophe. in addition, following catastrophes, there are sometimes legislative and administrative initiatives and court decisions that seek to expand insurance coverage for catastrophe claims
beyond the original intent of the policies or seek to prevent the application of deductibles. also, our ability to adjust terms, including deductible levels, or to increase pricing to the extent
necessary to offset rising costs of catastrophes, particularly in the personal insurance segment, requires approval of regulatory authorities of certain states. our ability or our willingness to
manage our catastrophe exposure by raising prices, modifying underwriting terms or reducing exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public policy, the evolving
political environment, changes in the general economic climate and/or social responsibilities. we also may choose to write business in catastrophe-prone areas that we might not otherwise write for
strategic purposes, such as improving our access to other underwriting activities.
there
are also risks that impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability to
access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the
reserves. complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional
living expenses; the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage; business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectability. the timing of a catastrophe's
occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to us in estimating reserves for that reporting period. the estimates related to catastrophes
are adjusted as actual claims emerge and additional information becomes available.
exposure
to catastrophe losses or actual losses resulting from a catastrophe could adversely affect our financial strength and claims-paying ratings and could impair our ability to raise
capital on acceptable terms or at all. also, as a result of our exposure to catastrophe losses or actual losses following a catastrophe, rating agencies may further increase capital requirements,
which may require us to raise capital to maintain our ratings or adversely affect our ratings. a ratings downgrade could hurt our ability to compete effectively or attract new business. in addition,
catastrophic events could cause us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely impact the cost and availability of reinsurance. such events can also impact the credit of our
reinsurers. for a discussion of our catastrophe reinsurance coverage, see "item1businessreinsurancecatastrophe reinsurance." catastrophic events could
also adversely impact the credit of the issuers of securities, such as states or municipalities, in whom we have invested.
in
addition, coverage in our reinsurance program for terrorism is limited. although the terrorism risk insurance program (the program) provides benefits in the event of certain acts of
terrorism, those benefits are subject to a deductible and other limitations. under this program, once our losses exceed 20% of our commercial property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding
calendar year, the
federal government will reimburse us for 85% of our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism which exceed this deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100billion. our
estimated deductible under the program is $2.17billion for 2012. in addition, because the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied
to specific circumstances. it is also possible that future legislative action could change the program. the program is due to expire at the end of 2014, unless extended.
because
of the risks set forth above, catastrophes such as those caused by various natural events or man-made events such as a terrorist attack, including "unconventional"
acts of terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. further, while
we seek to manage our exposure to
table of contents
man-made
catastrophic events involving conventional means, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or more
man-made catastrophic events involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological means.
during or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected.over the
past several years, worldwide financial markets have experienced significant disruptions and, during a portion of this period, the united states and many other economies experienced a prolonged
economic downturn, resulting in heightened credit risk, reduced valuation of investments and decreased economic activity. while economic conditions have generally moderated, financial markets continue
to experience periodic disruptions, and there is continued uncertainty regarding the duration and strength of any economic recovery. even if growth continues, it may be at a slow rate for an extended
period of time, and other economic conditions, such as the residential and commercial real estate environment and employment rates, may continue to be weak. in addition, while inflation has recently
been limited and that trend may continue, it is possible that steps taken by the federal government to stabilize financial markets and improve economic conditions could lead to an inflationary
environment. furthermore, financial markets may again experience significant and prolonged disruption.
economic
uncertainty has recently been exacerbated by the increased potential for default by one or more european sovereign debt issuers, the potential partial or complete dissolution of
the eurozone and its common currency and the negative impact of such events on global financial institutions and capital markets generally. actions or inactions of european governments may impact
these actual or perceived risks. in the u.s. during 2011, one rating agency downgraded the u.s.'s long-term debt credit rating from aaa. future actions or inactions of the united states
government, including a shutdown of the federal government, could increase the actual or perceived risk that the u.s. may not ultimately pay its obligations when due and may disrupt financial markets.
if
economic conditions remain weak or deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial
position and/or liquidity. several of the risk factors discussed below identify risks that result from, or are exacerbated by, an economic slowdown or financial disruption. these include risks
discussed below related to our investment portfolio, reinsurance arrangements, other credit exposures, our estimates of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, emerging claim and coverage
issues, the competitive environment, regulatory developments and the impact of rating agency actions. you should also refer to "item7management's discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operation", particularly the "outlook" section.
many
of these risks could materialize, and our financial results could be negatively impacted, even after the end of an economic downturn or financial disruption. during or following an
economic downturn, lower levels of economic activity could reduce (and historically have reduced) exposure changes at renewal. they also could adversely impact (and historically have adversely
impacted) audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written, particularly in our business units within business insurance, which could
adversely impact our written premiums. in addition, because earned premiums lag written premiums, our results can be adversely affected after general economic conditions have improved. an inflationary
environment (which may follow government efforts to stabilize the economy) may also, as we discuss below, adversely impact our loss costs and could adversely impact the valuation of our investment
portfolio. finally, as a result of the financial market disruptions over the past several years, we may, as discussed below, face increased regulation.
if actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, our
financial results could be materially and adversely affected.claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not
table of contents
represent
an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, generally utilizing actuarial expertise
and projection techniques, at a given accounting date.
the
process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables can be affected by both
internal and
external events, such as: changes in claims handling procedures; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures on medical costs and auto and home repair costs; economic
conditions including general inflation; legal trends and legislative changes; and varying judgments and viewpoints of the individuals involved in the estimation process, among others. the impact of
many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly
by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time
between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer).
as
discussed above, it is possible that steps taken by the federal government to stabilize the economy could lead to an inflationary environment, which could in turn, lead to an increase
in our loss costs. the impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines of business that are considered "long tail", such as general liability, as they require a relatively
long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. changes in the level of inflation also result in an increased level of uncertainty in our estimation of claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves, particularly for long tail lines of business. in addition, inflationary pressures in medical costs may be increased by the healthcare reform legislation. the estimation of
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may also be more difficult during times of adverse or uncertain economic conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders,
including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or increased frequency of small claims or delays in the reporting of claims.
we
continually refine our claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and
settled and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. business judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to
multiple sets of data and analyses. different experts may choose different assumptions when faced with material uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas
of focus. hence, such experts may at times produce estimates materially different from each other. this risk may be exacerbated in the context of an acquisition. experts providing input to the various
estimates and underlying assumptions include actuaries, underwriters, claim personnel and lawyers, as well as other members of management. therefore, management may have to consider varying individual
viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
we
attempt to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established or reviewed. due to the inherent uncertainty
underlying claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, the final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses will likely be higher or lower than the
related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than is currently reserved.
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities resulting from one insured event, or an accumulation of insured events, may exceed the current related reserves. in
addition, our estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in
estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and/or our financial position.

expense reserves."
our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses.investment returns are an important part
of our
overall profitability. fixed maturity and short-term investments comprised approximately 93% of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december31, 2011. changes in
interest rates caused by inflation or other factors (inclusive of credit spreads) affect the carrying value of our fixed maturity investments and returns on our fixed maturity and
short-term investments. a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on short-term investments and new fixed maturity investments (including those purchased to
re-invest maturities from the existing portfolio), thereby negatively impacting our net investment income, while rising interest rates reduce the market value of existing fixed maturity
investments. interest rates in recent periods have been at or near historically low levels, and it is possible that rates may remain at low levels for a prolonged period. the value of our fixed
maturity and short-term investments is subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to a deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers
of the securities held in our portfolio, or due to a deterioration in the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an issuer's payments of such investments. such defaults and impairments
could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. during an economic downturn, fixed maturity and short-term investments could be subject to a higher risk of
default.
our
fixed maturity investment portfolio is invested, in substantial part, in obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal
bond portfolio). notwithstanding the relatively low historical rates of default on many of these obligations and notwithstanding that we typically seek to invest in high-credit-quality
securities (including those with structural protections such as being secured by dedicated or pledged sources of revenue), our municipal bond portfolio could be subject to default or impairment. in
particular:
the prolonged economic downturn that began in 2008, and the limited economic recovery, has resulted in many states and
local governments operating under deficits or projected deficits. the severity and duration of these deficits could have an adverse impact on the collectability and valuation of our municipal bond
portfolio. these deficits may be exacerbated by the impact of unfunded pension plan obligations or by declining municipal tax bases and revenues in times of financial stress.
some issuers may be unwilling to increase tax rates, or to reduce spending, to fund interest or principal payments on
their municipal bonds, or may be unable to access the municipal bond market to fund such payments. the risk of widespread defaults may increase if some issuers voluntarily choose to default, instead
of implementing difficult fiscal measures, and the actual or perceived consequences (such as reduced access to capital markets) are less severe than expected.
the risk of widespread defaults may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit states, municipalities
and political subdivisions to file for bankruptcy protection where they were not permitted before. in addition, the collectability and valuation of municipal bonds may be adversely affected if there
are judicial interpretations in a bankruptcy or other proceeding that lessen the value of structural protections. for example, in a recent municipal bankruptcy proceeding the debtor challenged the
effectiveness of structural protections thought to be provided by municipal securities backed by a dedicated source of revenue.
our
portfolio has also benefited from tax exemptions and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as
foreign tax credits).
table of contents
federal
and/or state tax legislation could be enacted in connection with deficit reduction or various types of fundamental tax reform that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages
currently benefiting us and could adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio.
our
investment portfolio includes: residential mortgage-backed securities; collateralized mortgage obligations; pass-through securities and asset-backed securities
collateralized by sub-prime mortgages; commercial mortgage-backed securities; and wholly-owned real estate, real estate partnerships and mortgage loans, all of which could be adversely
impacted by further declines in real estate valuations and/or financial market disruption. in addition, the potential for
protracted disruption and/or suspension of foreclosure practices could also impact the returns on certain of these portfolios.
we
also invest a portion of our assets in equity securities, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships, all of which are subject to greater
volatility in their investment returns than fixed maturity investments. general economic conditions, changes in applicable tax laws and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the
value of our non-fixed maturity investments and the realization of net investment income, and/or result in realized investment losses. as a result of these factors, we may realize reduced
returns on these investments, incur losses on sales of these investments and be required to write down the value of these investments, which could reduce our net investment income and result in
realized investment losses.
our
investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are
illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e.,the carrying amount) of the portion of the investment portfolio that is carried at fair value as reflected in our
financial statements is not reflective of prices at which actual transactions could occur.
because
of the risks set forth above, the value of our investment portfolio could decrease, we could experience reduced net investment income and we could experience realized and/or
unrealized investment losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation.
with
regard to asbestos claims, we continue to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from policyholders (including others seeking coverage under a policy). factors underlying
these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on previously peripheral defendants. the focus on these defendants is primarily the
result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. the bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has prompted plaintiffs to aggressively
seek out potential new defendants and has caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but who remain in the tort system. currently, in many jurisdictions,
those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible
disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. this trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on
previously peripheral defendants, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payments experienced by us.
we
also continue to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or a
portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. in these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated
as a separate occurrence under the policy. it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor
and our other defenses are not
table of contents
successful,
our coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily
injury claims against the policyholders. accordingly, although we have seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these
claims.
further,
in addition to asbestos claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including us, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with
respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. it is possible that the filing of other direct actions against
insurers, including us, could be made in the future. it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against
insurers based on novel legal theories of liability.
with
regard to environmental claims, we continue to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of
toxic substances. mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. for instance, the comprehensive environmental response,
compensation and liability act (cercla), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened
releases of hazardous substances. this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. liability
under cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties.
the
company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. the company believes that some court decisions
have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction.
uncertainties
surrounding the final resolution of these asbestos and environmental claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for such claims and related
litigation. as a result,
these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without
limitation:
the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation;
any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants;
a further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is
anticipated;
the role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued;
the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental
claims in a manner inconsistent with our previous assessment of these claims;
the number and outcome of direct actions against us;
future developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims;
the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy
limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers; and
uncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants.
table of contents
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and
environmental claims. this environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges
to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until
settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in
bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective.
while
the ongoing evaluation of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded
theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in
liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. see the "asbestos claims and litigation" and
"environmental claims and litigation" sections of "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." also see
"item3legal proceedings."
we are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or
substances.in addition to asbestos and environmental claims, we face exposure to other types of mass tort claims, including claims related to exposure to
potentially harmful products or substances, including lead paint, silica and welding rod fumes. establishing claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for mass tort claims is subject to
uncertainties because of many factors, including expanded theories of liability, disputes concerning medical causation with respect to certain diseases, geographical concentration of the lawsuits
asserting the claims and the potential for a large rise in the total number of claims without underlying epidemiological developments suggesting an increase in disease rates. moreover, evolving
judicial interpretations regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liabilities, as well as the application of
insurance coverage to these claims, make it difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims.
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, our estimate of claims and claim
adjustment expenses may change, and such change could be material. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially
and adversely affect our results of operations.
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and
other
environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge. these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our
underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to:
judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability;
plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including us, in purported class action litigation relating to
claims-handling and other practices;
claims relating to construction defects, which often present complex coverage and damage valuation questions;
claims under directors'& officers' insurance policies relating to losses from involvement in financial market
activities, such as mortgage or financial product origination, distribution, structuring or servicing and foreclosure procedures; failed financial institutions; fraud, including
table of contents
those
related to investment management businesses; possible accounting irregularities; and corporate governance issues;
the assertion of "public nuisance" or similar theories of liability, pursuant to which plaintiffs seek to recover monies
spent to administer public health care programs, abate hazards to public health and safety and/or recover damages purportedly attributable to a "public nuisance";
claims relating to molestation by an employee of an insured;
medical developments that link health issues to particular causes, resulting in liability claims;
claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies; and
claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions, including higher frequency and severity of weather-related
events.
in
some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies. as a result, the full extent of liability under our
insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued.
in
addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to deem by statute the existence of a covered occurrence, to
extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business.
the
effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of
operations.
the intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.the
property and
casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, and we believe that it will remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. we compete with both domestic and foreign insurers which may offer
products at prices and on terms that are not consistent with our economic standards in an effort to maintain or increase their business. the competitive environment in which we operate could also be
impacted by current general economic conditions, which could reduce the volume of business available to us as well as to our competitors. in addition, the competitive environment could be impacted by
changes in customer preferences, including customer demand for direct distribution channels. see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationoutlook."
a
substantial majority of the company's personal insurance business is written after an agent compares quotes using comparative raters, a cost-efficient means of obtaining
quotes from multiple companies. the usage of comparative raters tends to increase the focus on price over other competitive criteria. over time, this increased focus on price may provide a relative
advantage to carriers that have more efficient cost structures and that are better able to accurately estimate, and price for, claims and claim adjustment expenses. if we are not able to operate with
a competitive cost structure or accurately estimate and price for claims and claim adjustment expenses, our underwriting margins could be adversely affected over time. additionally, there is potential
for similar technology to be used to access comparative rates for small commercial business. agents and brokers may also create alternate distribution channels for commercial business, such as
insurance exchanges, that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.
our
competitive position is based on many factors including but not limited to our:
ability to retain existing customers, to obtain new business and to profitably price our business;
agent, broker and client relationships;
speed of claims payment;
table of contents
premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered (including the ability to design customized
programs);
ability to provide our products and services in a cost effective manner;
perceived overall financial strength and corresponding ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;
reputation, experience and qualifications of employees;
geographic scope of business;
local presence; and
ability to keep pace relative to our competitors with changes in technology and information systems.
we
may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. if competition limits our ability to retain existing business or write new business at
adequate rates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. see "competition" sections of the discussion on business segments in "item1business."
we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at
all.although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. as a result,
ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. accordingly, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.
in
the past, certain reinsurers have ceased writing business and entered into runoff. some of our reinsurance claims may be disputed by the reinsurers, and we may ultimately receive
partial or no payment. this is a particular risk in the case of claims that relate to insurance policies written many years ago, including those relating to asbestos and environmental claims. in
addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the european union and the united kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less
creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority.
included
in reinsurance recoverables are certain amounts related to structured settlements. structured settlements comprise annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to
settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where we did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured
settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables as we retain the contingent liability to the claimant. in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, we
would be required to make such payments if and to the extent not paid by state guaranty associations.
many
reinsurance companies and life insurance companies were negatively impacted by the financial markets disruption and the economic downturn over the past several years. a number of
these
companies, including certain of those with which we conduct business, were downgraded by various rating agencies during this time period. for a discussion of our top reinsurance groups by reinsurance
recoverable and the top five groups by amount of structured settlements provided, see "item7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationsreinsurance recoverables."
the
availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity. the availability of reinsurance capacity can be
impacted by general economic conditions and conditions in the reinsurance market, such as the occurrence of significant
table of contents
reinsured
events. the availability and cost of reinsurance could affect our business volume and profitability.
because
of the risks set forth above, we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at
commercially reasonable rates or at all, and/or life insurance companies may fail to make required annuity payments, and thus our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we are exposed to credit risk in certain of our business operations.in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our investment
portfolio and
reinsurance recoverables (discussed above), we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business operations, including credit risk relating to policyholders, independent agents and
brokers.
we
are exposed to credit risk in our surety insurance operations, where we guarantee to a third party that our customer will satisfy certain performance obligations (e.g., a construction
contract) or certain financial obligations. if a customer of ours defaults, we may suffer losses and not be reimbursed by that customer. in addition, it is customary practice in the surety business
for multiple insurers to participate as co-sureties on large surety bonds. under these arrangements, the co-surety obligations are typically joint and several, in which case we
are also exposed to credit risk with respect to our co-sureties.
in
addition, a portion of our business is written with large deductible insurance policies. under workers' compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, we are obligated to
pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. we are subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the
deductible amount, and, as a result, we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder. moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers' compensation policies (i.e., policies in
which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period). retrospectively rated policies expose us to additional credit
risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium.
our
efforts to mitigate the credit risk that we have to our insureds may not be successful. to reduce such credit risk, we require certain insureds to post collateral for some or all of
these obligations, often in the form of pledged securities such as money market funds or letters of credit provided by banks. in cases where we receive pledged securities and the insureds are unable
to honor their obligations, we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged and/or the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed during an insured's bankruptcy. in cases where
we receive letters of credit from banks and the insureds are unable to honor their obligations, we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit.
in
accordance with industry practice, when policyholders purchase insurance policies from us through independent agents and brokers, the premiums relating to those policies are often
paid to the agents and brokers for payment to us. in most jurisdictions, the premiums will be deemed to have been paid to us whether or not they are actually received by us. consequently, we assume a
degree of credit risk associated with amounts due from independent agents and brokers.
to
a large degree, the credit risk we face is a function of the economy; accordingly, we face a greater risk in an economic downturn. while we attempt to manage the risks discussed above
through underwriting and investment guidelines, collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful. for example, collateral obtained may subsequently have little
or no value. as a result, our exposure to the above credit risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
table of contents
within the united states, our businesses are heavily regulated by the states in which we conduct business, including licensing and supervision, and changes in regulation may reduce
our
profitability and limit our growth.these regulatory systems are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of
insurers, their shareholders and other investors. for example, to protect policyholders whose insurance company becomes financially insolvent, guaranty funds have been established in all 50 states to
pay the covered claims of policyholders in the event of an insolvency of an insurer, subject to applicable state limits. the funding of guaranty funds is provided through assessments levied against
remaining insurers in the marketplace. as a result, the insolvency of one or more insurance companies could result in additional assessments levied against us.
these
regulatory systems also address authorization for lines of business, policyholders' surplus requirements, limitations on the types and amounts of certain investments, underwriting
limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurer's business.
in
recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. further, the naic and state insurance regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing
on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. in a time of financial uncertainty or a prolonged economic downturn
or otherwise, regulators may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations. for example, insurance regulators may choose to restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make
payments to their parent companies or reject rate increases due to the economic environment. the state insurance regulators may also increase the statutory capital requirements for our insurance
subsidiaries.
in
addition, state tax laws that specifically impact the insurance industry, such as premium taxes or other taxes, may be enacted or changed by states to raise revenues.
state
regulations or laws that are adopted or amended may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus
could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.
changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on us and otherwise adversely impact our results.while the u.s. federal
government
has not historically regulated the insurance business, in 2010 the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act) established a federal
insurance office within the u.s. department of the treasury. the federal insurance office has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather data and information regarding the insurance
industry and insurers, including conducting a study for submission to the u.s. congress on how to modernize and improve insurance regulation in the u.s.
further, the dodd-frank act gives the federal reserve supervisory authority over a number of nonbank financial services holding companies, including insurance companies, if they are
designated by a two-thirds vote of a financial stability oversight council (the council) as "systemically important financial institutions" (sifi). while recent rules proposed by the
council support our view that we will not be designated as a sifi as defined in the dodd-frank act, it is possible that the council may change its rules or interpretations in the future
and conclude that we are a sifi. if we were designated as "systemically important," the federal reserve's supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation and
could impact requirements regarding our capital, liquidity and leverage as well as our business and investment conduct. as a result of the foregoing, the dodd-frank act, or other
additional federal regulation that is adopted in the future, could impose significant burdens on us, including impacting the ways in which we conduct our business, increasing compliance costs and
duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive disadvantage, particularly relative to smaller insurers that may not be subject to the same level of regulation.
table of contents
even
if we are not subject to additional regulation by the federal government, significant financial sector regulatory reform, including the dodd-frank act, could have a
significant impact on us. for example, regulatory reform could have an unexpected impact on our rights as a creditor or on our competitive position. in particular, the dodd-frank act
authorizes assessments to pay for the resolution of systemically important financial institutions that have become insolvent. we (as a financial company with more than $50billion in assets)
could be assessed, and, although any such assessment is required to be risk weighted (i.e., riskier firms pay more), such costs could be material to us and are not currently estimable.
other
potential changes in u.s. federal legislation, regulation and/or administrative policies, including the potential repeal of the mccarran-ferguson act and potential changes in
federal taxation, could also significantly harm the insurance industry, including us.
a downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase
our
borrowing costs.claims-paying and financial strength ratings are important to an insurer's competitive position. rating agencies review insurers' ratings
periodically, and change their ratings criteria periodically, and therefore our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. a downgrade in one or more of our ratings could negatively impact
our business volumes because demand for certain of our products may be reduced, particularly because many customers may require that we maintain minimum ratings to enter into or renew business with
us. additionally, we may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs. if significant losses, including, but not limited to, those resulting from one or
more major catastrophes, or significant reserve additions or significant investment losses were to cause our capital position to deteriorate significantly, or if one or more rating
agencies substantially increase their capital requirements, we may need to raise equity capital in the future (which we may not be able to do at a reasonable cost or at all) in order to maintain our
ratings or limit the extent of a downgrade. a continued trend of more frequent and severe weather-related catastrophes or a prolonged economic downturn may lead rating agencies to substantially
increase their capital requirements. for further discussion about our ratings, see, "item1businessratings."
the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations, pay future shareholder
dividends
or make future share repurchases.our holding company relies on dividends from our insurance subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and
principal on outstanding debt, to pay dividends to shareholders, to make contributions to our qualified domestic pension plan, to pay other corporate expenses and to make share repurchases. the
ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in the future will depend on their statutory surplus, earnings and regulatory restrictions.
we
are subject to regulation by some states as an insurance holding company system. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum
amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. in a time of prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, regulators may choose to
further restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies. the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company is also restricted
by regulations that set standards of solvency that must be met and maintained.
the
inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in an amount sufficient to meet our debt service obligations and other cash requirements could harm
our ability to meet our obligations, to pay future shareholder dividends and to make share repurchases.
disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us.we market our insurance products
primarily
through independent agents and brokers. an
table of contents
important
part of our business is written through less than a dozen such intermediaries. further, there has been a trend of increased consolidation by agents and brokers, which could impact our
relationships with and fees paid to some agents and brokers. loss of all or a substantial portion of the
business provided through such agents and brokers could materially and adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations.
we
may also seek to develop new product distribution channels, including our current efforts to establish a direct-to-consumer platform in the personal insurance
segment. in addition, agents and brokers may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business, such as insurance exchanges, that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.
our or their efforts with respect to alternate distribution channels could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting
in a lower volume of business generated from these sources.
we
rely on internet applications for the marketing and sale of certain of our products, and we may increasingly rely on internet applications and toll-free numbers for
distribution. in some instances, our agents and brokers are required to access separate business platforms to execute the sale of our personal insurance or commercial insurance products. should
internet disruptions occur, or frustration with our business platforms or distribution initiatives develop among our independent agents and brokers, the resulting loss of business could materially and
adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations. see "if we experience difficulties with technology, data security and/or outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our
business could be negatively impacted" below.
our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets may not be successful and may create enhanced risks.a number of our
recent and
planned business initiatives involve developing new products or expanding existing products in targeted markets. this includes the following efforts, from time to time, to protect or grow market
share:
we may develop products that insure risks we have not previously insured or contain new coverage or coverage terms.
we may refine our underwriting processes. for example, in certain of our businesses in recent years, we have substantially
increased the volume of business that flows through our automated underwriting and pricing systems.
we may seek to expand distribution channels, such as our efforts to develop a direct-to-consumer
platform in personal insurance.
we may focus on geographic markets within or outside of the united states where we have had relatively little or no market
share.
we
may not be successful in introducing new products or expanding in targeted markets and, even if we are successful, these efforts may create enhanced risks. among other
risks:
demand for new products or in new markets may not meet our expectations.
to the extent we are able to market new products or expand in new markets, our risk exposures may change, and the data and
models we use to manage such exposures may not be as sophisticated as those we use in existing markets or with existing products. this, in turn, could lead to losses in excess of our expectations.
models underlying automated underwriting and pricing decisions may not be effective.
efforts to develop new products or markets have the potential to create or increase distribution channel conflict, such as
described above under "disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us."
table of contents
in connection with the conversion of existing policyholders to a new product, some policyholders' pricing may increase,
while the pricing for other policyholders may decrease, the net impact of which could negatively impact retention and margins.
to develop new products or markets, we may need to make substantial capital and operating expenditures, which may also
negatively impact results in the near term.
if
our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets are not successful, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
any net deferred tax asset could be adversely affected by a reduction in the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate.federal tax
legislation could be
enacted to reduce the existing statutory u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35%, which would, accordingly, reduce any net deferred tax asset. the amount of any net deferred tax asset is
volatile and significantly impacted by changes in unrealized investment gains and losses. the effect of a reduction in a tax rate on net deferred tax assets is required to be recognized, in full, as a
reduction of income from continuing operations in the period when enacted and, therefore, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
we may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.the
profitability of our
property and casualty business substantially depends on the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in pricing our policies. we utilize third-party and
proprietary models to help us price business in a manner that is intended to be consistent, over time, with actual results and return objectives. we incorporate the company's historical loss
experience, external industry data and economic indices into our modeling processes, and we use various methods, including predictive modeling, forecasting and sophisticated simulation modeling
techniques, to analyze loss trends and the risks associated with our assets and liabilities. we also use these modeling processes, analyses and methods in making underwriting, pricing and reinsurance
decisions as part of managing our exposure to catastrophes and other extreme adverse events. these modeling processes incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and
variability of: interest rates, inflation, capital requirements, and frequency and severity of losses, among others, that are difficult to make and may differ materially from actual results.
whether
we use a proprietary or third-party model, future experience may be materially different from past and current experience incorporated in a model's forecasts or simulations. this
includes the likelihood of events occurring or continuing or the correlation among events. if we fail to appropriately price the risks we insure, or fail to change our pricing model to appropriately
reflect our current
experience, or if our claims experience is more frequent or severe than our underlying risk assumptions, our profit margins may be negatively affected. if we underestimate the frequency and/or
severity of extreme adverse events occurring, our financial condition may be adversely affected. if we overestimate the risks we are exposed to, we may overprice our products, and new business growth
and retention of our existing business may be adversely affected. as we expand into different markets and geographies, we will write more policies in markets and geographical areas where we have less
data specific to these new markets and geographies, and, accordingly, we may be more susceptible to error in our models and strategy. see "item7management's discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operationscatastrophe modeling."
third
party models may provide substantially different indications than what our proprietary modeling processes provide. for example, during the first quarter of 2011, a new version of a
third-party computer model utilized by us, as well as others in the insurance industry, to estimate potential aggregate hurricane losses was released. after evaluating multiple models and calibrating
our own historical loss experience and underwriting practices, we increased our estimated modeled loss, using our own proprietary modeling processes, from a single u.s. hurricane by a range of 10% to
24%. see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscatastrophe modeling." third-party model estimates of losses can
be, and often have been, materially
table of contents
different
for similar events in comparison to our proprietary estimates. the differences between third-party model estimates and our proprietary estimates are driven by the use of different data sets
as well as different assumptions and forecasts regarding the frequency and severity of events and claims arising from the events. these assumptions and forecasts may be difficult to make and may
differ materially from actual results.
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our business outside the united states.we conduct business outside the united
states primarily
in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of ireland. in addition, we have commenced a joint venture in brazil and may also explore opportunities in other countries, including latin american
countries and other emerging markets such as india and china.
while
our business outside of the united states currently constitutes a relatively small portion of our revenues, in conducting such business we are subject to a number of significant
risks, particularly in emerging economies. these risks include restrictions such as price controls, capital controls, currency exchange limits, ownership limits and other restrictive or
anti-competitive governmental actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation. our investments outside the united states may also subject us to currency risk
and, in some markets, it may be difficult
to effectively hedge that risk. in addition, in some markets, we may invest as part of a joint venture with a local counterparty. because our governance rights may be limited, we may not have control
over the ability of the joint venture to make certain decisions and/or mitigate risks it faces, and significant disagreements with a joint venture counterparty may adversely impact our investment.
investments outside the united states also subject us to additional domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws in other countries that
prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials. although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws, if those controls are ineffective
and an employee or intermediary fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties and our business and our reputation could be adversely affected. some
countries, particularly emerging economies, have laws and regulations that lack clarity and, even with local expertise and effective controls, it can be difficult to determine the exact requirements
of, and potential liability under, the local laws. for example, in some jurisdictions, including brazil, parties to a joint venture may, in some circumstances, have liability for some obligations of
the venture and that liability may extend beyond the capital invested. failure to comply with local laws in a particular market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and
negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally.
new regulations outside of the u.s., including in the european union, could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our
growth.insurance laws or regulations that are adopted or amended in jurisdictions outside the u.s. may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and
may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.
in
particular, the european union's executive body, the european commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called solvencyii that would
apply to our businesses in the european union beginning as soon as the first quarter of 2013. under solvencyii, it is possible that the direct or indirect parent of a european union subsidiary
(including a u.s. parent company) could be subject to certain solvencyii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary's capital position is dependent on an affiliated or parent
company and the affiliated or parent company is not already subject to regulations deemed "equivalent" to solvencyii. in addition, regulators in countries where we have operations are working
with the international association of insurance supervisors (iais) (and in the u.s., with the naic) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including group supervision. while it is not
yet known how these actions will impact us, such regulation could result in increased costs of compliance, increased disclosure and less flexibility in our capital management.
table of contents
the iais is also working with the financial stability board created by the g-20 and is expected to recommend a methodology for determining whether and
which, if any, insurance companies pose a systemic risk to the global economy. such insurers would be designated "globally systemically important financial institutions" (g-sifis) and
would likely be subject to higher capital requirements, enhanced supervision or both. the iais has not yet decided upon the criteria for or the consequences of such designation.
our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in
technology.we depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business and processing claims, as well as for providing the data and analytics we
utilize to manage our business, and thus our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems
that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner. some system development projects are long-term in nature, may negatively impact our
expense ratios as we invest in the projects and may cost more than we expect to complete. in addition, system development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are complete, or may
be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in accelerated recognition of expenses. if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology
portfolio, or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect, our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement our
strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted.
if we experience difficulties with technology, data security and/or outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively
impacted.while technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives present significant risks.
our business is highly dependent upon our employees' ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions. a shut-down of, or inability to access,
one or more of our facilities; a power outage; or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such
functions on a timely basis. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or industrial accident, or due to a computer virus, our systems could be inaccessible for an
extended period of time. in addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems increasingly interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service
denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if our business continuity plans did not sufficiently address
such a business interruption, system failure or service denial, this could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims
in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions.
our
operations rely on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. computer viruses, hackers,
employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber attacks or other disruptions. in addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal,
confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. while we attempt to develop secure transmission capabilities with third-party vendors and others with whom we do business,
we may be unable to put in place secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and, in addition, these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the
confidentiality of the information.
these
increased risks, and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security, could expose us to data loss, disruption of service, monetary and reputational damages and
significant increases in compliance costs. as a result, our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected.
table of contents
we
have increasingly outsourced certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may continue to do so in the future. if we do not effectively develop, implement
and monitor our outsourcing relationships, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize expected
productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business. our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions
to third parties may
expose us to enhanced risk related to data security or service disruptions, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. in addition, our ability to receive services from third party
providers outside of the united states might be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies inside or outside of the united states. as a
result, our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected.
acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences.from time
to time we may
investigate and pursue acquisition opportunities if we believe that such opportunities are consistent with our long-term objectives and that the potential rewards of an acquisition exceed
the risks. the process of integrating an acquired company or business can be complex and costly, however, and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. for example, acquisitions
may present significant risks, including:
the potential disruption of our ongoing business;
the ineffective integration of underwriting, claims handling and actuarial practices;
the uncertainty of an acquiree's reserve estimates;
the diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges;
the loss of key employees;
the cultural challenges associated with integrating employees; and
the impact of an acquisition on our financial position and/or credit ratings.
the
acquired business may not perform as projected, and any cost savings and other synergies anticipated from the acquisition may not materialize. there is no guarantee that any
businesses acquired in the future will be successfully integrated, and the ineffective integration of our businesses and processes may result in substantial costs or delays and adversely affect our
ability to compete.
changes to existing accounting standards may adversely impact our reported results.as a u.s.-based sec reporting company, we are
currently required
to prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board (fasb). during the last several
years, the securities and exchange commission (sec) has been evaluating whether, when and how international financial reporting standards (ifrs) should be incorporated into the u.s. financial
reporting system, including for companies such as us. the fasb and the iasb have also embarked on a long-term project to converge gaap and ifrs. additionally, the iasb and the fasb are in
the process of developing a global insurance standard that may involve methodologies for valuing insurance contract liabilities that may be significantly different from the methodologies required by
current gaap. we are not able to predict whether we will choose to, or be required to, adopt ifrs or how the adoption of ifrs (or the convergence of gaap and ifrs, including the project for valuing
insurance contract liabilities) may impact our financial statements in the future. changes in accounting standards, particularly those that specifically apply to insurance company operations, may
impact the content and presentation of our reported financial results and could have adverse consequences to our reported financial results, including lower reported results of operations and
shareholders' equity and increased volatility and decreased comparability of our reported results with other insurers.
table of contents
we could be adversely affected if our controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not
effective.our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claim processing and investment
activities, many of which are highly complex. these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards. a control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. if our controls are not effective, it could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk
exposure (including underwriting, credit and investment risk) or damage to our reputation.
our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.there is significant competition from
within the
property and casualty insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially in key positions. our performance is largely dependent on the talents, efforts and
proper conduct of highly-skilled individuals; therefore, our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses and to expand into new business areas depends on our ability to attract new
employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. if we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate our employees, our business, financial results and reputation could be
materially and adversely affected.
loss of or significant restriction on the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of personal insurance products could reduce our future
profitability.in personal insurance, we use credit scoring as a factor in pricing decisions where allowed by state law. some consumer groups and regulators have
questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against people with low incomes, minority groups and the elderly and are calling for the prohibition or restriction on the use of
credit scoring in underwriting and pricing. laws or regulations that significantly curtail the use of credit scoring, if enacted in a large number of states, could adversely affect our future
profitability.

the
company's board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to
pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of rule10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. the authorizations do not
have a stated expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the company's financial position, earnings, capital
requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, share price, catastrophe losses, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, other investment
opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions), market conditions and other factors.
the

following discussions of the company's net income and segment operating income (loss) are presented on an after-tax basis. discussions of the components of net income and
segment operating income are presented on a pretax basis, unless otherwise noted. discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis.
overview
diluted net income per share of $3.36 in 2011 decreased by 49% from 2010, while net income of $1.43billion decreased by 56%
from 2010. the lower rate of decline in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of common share repurchases. the decline in net income in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily reflected a
significant increase in catastrophe losses and lower net favorable prior year reserve development, along with lower underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development
("underlying underwriting margins") related to earned pricing and loss cost trends, higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, and lower net investment income and net realized
investment gains. catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 were $2.56billion and $1.11billion, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 and 2010 was
$715million and $1.25billion,
table of contents
respectively.
net income in 2011 benefited from a reduction in income tax expense of $104million resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters.
diluted
net income per share of $6.62 in 2010 increased by 5% over 2009, despite a decrease in reported net income, due to the favorable impact of common share repurchases. net income of
$3.22billion in 2010 was $406million lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting a significant increase in catastrophe losses, a modest decline in net favorable prior year reserve
development and reduced underlying underwriting margins related to earned pricing and loss cost trends, partially offset by increases in net investment income and net realized investment gains. net
income in 2009 reflected a reduction in income tax expense of $89million resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters and an $87million reduction in the
estimate of property windpool assessments related to hurricane ike that had been recorded in general and administrative expenses in 2008. catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $1.11billion
and $457million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 was $1.25billion and $1.33billion, respectively.
revenues
earned premiums
earned premiums of $22.09billion in 2011 were $658million, or 3%, higher than in 2010. in the business insurance

2011 declined by $167million
compared with 2010, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market, as well as lower average levels of fixed maturity invested assets due to the
company's common share repurchases. net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments of $355million in 2011 was $15million lower than in 2010. the average

in
the second quarter of 2009, the company adopted updated accounting guidance that changed the reporting of other-than-temporary impairments. see note1
of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of the adoption.
other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments investment impairments in 2011 and 2010 were not significant. in 2009,
worldwide financial markets experienced significant disruptions, and the united states and many other countries experienced an economic downturn, resulting in heightened credit risks, reduced
valuations of investments and decreased economic activity. these factors resulted in $258million of other-than-temporary impairment losses in 2009. impairments in the
fixed maturity portfolio in 2009 were $169million and included $81million related to structured mortgage securities, $70million related to various issuers' deteriorated
financial position and $18million with respect to securities that the company either had the intent to sell or did not have the ability to assert an intention to hold until recovery in fair
value. equity impairments in 2009 were $79million, the majority of which were related to issuers in the financial services industry. impairments in 2009 also included $10million
related to other investments.
other net realized investment gainsother net realized investment gains in 2011 were $80million, primarily driven by $52million of net
realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $46million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities and $41million of net realized

investment
gains related to other investments, partially offset by net realized investment losses of $62million associated with u.s. treasury futures contracts (which require daily
mark-to-market settlement and are used to shorten the duration of the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio).
other
net realized investment gains in 2010 were $290million, including a $205million pretax gain resulting from the company's sale of substantially all of its remaining
common stock holdings in verisk analytics,inc. (verisk) for total proceeds of approximately $230million as part of a secondary public offering of verisk. the 2010 total also included
$96million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments and $25million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities. these gains were
partially offset by $30million of net realized investment losses related to u.s. treasury futures contracts.
other
net realized investment gains in 2009 were $275million. in october 2009, the company sold a portion of its common stock holdings in verisk for total proceeds of
approximately $184million as part of the initial public offering of verisk. the company recorded a pretax realized investment gain of $159million on this sale in 2009. other net
realized investment gains in 2009 also included $100million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $23million of net realized investment gains
associated with the u.s. treasury futures contracts and $23million of net realized investment losses related to foreign exchange.
other revenues
other revenues primarily consist of premium installment charges. in 2010, this category also included $60million of expenses
related to the company's purchase and retirement of $885million of its $1.0billion 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2011 were $16.28billion, $3.07billion, or 23%, higher than in 2010. the
increase primarily reflected the significant increase in catastrophe losses, a decrease in net favorable prior year reserve development, the impact of loss cost trends and higher
non-catastrophe weather-related losses. catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 were $2.56billion and $1.11billion, respectively. catastrophe losses in 2011 primarily resulted
from numerous tornadoes, wind and hail storms and severe winter storms, as well as hurricane irene. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 and 2010 was $715million and
$1.25billion, respectively. with respect to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011, accident years prior to and including 2009 experienced $1.10billion of net favorable
prior year reserve development, while the 2010 accident year experienced $383million of net unfavorable prior year reserve development. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve
development are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.
claims
and claim adjustment expenses were $13.21billion in 2010, $802million, or 6%, higher than in 2009. the increase primarily reflected the significant increase in
catastrophe losses, the modest decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and the impact of loss cost trends. catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $1.11billion and
$457million, respectively. catastrophe losses in 2010 primarily resulted from several severe wind and hail storms, as well as severe winter storms and an earthquake in chile. catastrophe
losses in 2009 primarily resulted from several wind and hail storms, as well as flooding. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 were $1.25billion and
$1.33billion, respectively.
table of contents
amortization of deferred acquisition costs
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2011 was $3.88billion, $74million, or 2%, higher than in 2010. the
amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 was $3.80billion, virtually level with the 2009 total. changes in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in both 2011 and 2010 were
generally consistent with the changes in earned premiums as compared with the respective prior year.
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses in 2011 were $3.56billion, $150million, or 4%, higher than in 2010. the increase in
2011 was primarily due to a higher level of state assessment expenses in the business insurance segment, increases in employee- and technology-related costs to enhance operations and support future
business growth in the financial, professional& international insurance segment and costs associated with the company's direct to consumer initiative in the personal insurance segment.
general
and administrative expenses in 2010 were $3.41billion, $40million, or 1%, higher than in 2009. the 2009 total included a reduction of $87million in the
estimate of property windpool assessments due to a decline in estimated insurance industry losses related to hurricane ike. excluding that adjustment in 2009, general and administrative expenses in
2010 were $47million, or 1%, lower than in 2009. the decline was concentrated in the business insurance segment, and was largely offset by higher expenses in the personal insurance segment
resulting from the company's direct to consumer initiative and in the financial, professional& international insurance segment due to employee- and technology-related costs to enhance
operations and support future business growth.
hurricane-related
property windpool assessments are levied on insurers periodically by state-created insurance and windstorm insurance entities such as citizens property insurance
corporation in florida, louisiana citizens property insurance corporation and the texas windstorm insurance association. these assessments are levied on the insurers writing business in those states
to fund the operating deficits of such entities during periods of significant storm activity. hurricane-related assessments are reported as a component of "general and administrative expenses" as the
amounts paid to such entities are not insured losses of the company.
interest expense
interest expense in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $386million, $388million and $382million, respectively. the
increase in 2010 over 2009 primarily reflected a higher average level of debt outstanding in 2010.
effective tax rate
the company's effective tax rate was (5%), 25% and 23% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. the company's income tax benefit of
$74million in 2011 primarily reflected the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the company's income tax provision. in addition, the income tax benefit in
2011 included the $104million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters recorded in the first quarter of 2011. the effective tax rate in 2009 also
benefited from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. excluding that benefit in 2009, the effective tax rates in 2010 and 2009 were virtually level.
gaap combined ratios
the consolidated gaap combined ratio of 105.1% in 2011 was 11.9 points higher than the consolidated gaap combined ratio of 93.2% in
2010.
table of contents
the
consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 72.9% in 2011 was 11.9 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.0% in 2010. catastrophe losses
accounted for 11.6 points and 5.2 points of the 2011 and 2010 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development provided 3.2 points and 5.8 points of
benefit to the consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011 and 2010, respectively. the consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year
reserve development in 2011 was 2.9 points higher than the 2010 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of loss cost trends and higher non-catastrophe weather-related
losses.
the
consolidated underwriting expense ratio of 32.2% in 2011 was level with the underwriting expense ratio in 2010.
the
consolidated gaap combined ratio of 93.2% in 2010 was 4.0 points higher than the consolidated gaap combined ratio of 89.2% in 2009.
the
consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.0% in 2010 was 3.7 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.3% in 2009. catastrophe losses
accounted for 5.2 points and 2.1 points of the 2010 and 2009 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development provided 5.8 points and 6.2 points of
benefit to the consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010 and 2009, respectively. the consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year
reserve development in 2010 was 0.2 points higher than the 2009 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of loss cost trends.
the
consolidated underwriting expense ratio of 32.2% in 2010 was 0.3 points higher than the 2009 consolidated underwriting expense ratio of 31.9%. the 2009 ratio reflected a 0.4 point
benefit resulting from the reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to hurricane ike. excluding that factor in 2009, the consolidated underwriting expense ratio in 2010 was
0.1 points lower than in 2009.

overview
operating income of $1.35billion in 2011 was $947million, or 41%, lower than in 2010. the decrease in 2011 primarily
reflected lower net favorable prior year reserve development and a significant increase in catastrophe losses, along with lower underlying underwriting margins related to earned pricing and loss cost
trends, and lower net investment income. these factors were partially offset by an increase in business volumes and a $76million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various
prior year tax matters. net favorable prior year reserve development was $245million in 2011, compared with $901million in 2010. catastrophe losses in 2011 were $1.02billion,
compared with $437million in 2010.
operating
income of $2.30billion in 2010 was $289million, or 11%, lower than in 2009. the decrease in 2010 primarily reflected a significant increase in catastrophe
losses, a modest decline in net favorable prior year reserve development, lower underlying underwriting margins related to earned pricing and loss cost trends, partially offset by an increase in net
investment income and a decline in general and administrative expenses. in addition, operating income in 2009 included a benefit of $42million from the favorable resolution of various prior
year tax matters and a $38million reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to hurricane ike. catastrophe losses in 2010 were $437million, compared with
$176million in 2009. net favorable prior year reserve development was $901million in 2010, compared with $1.03billion in 2009.
revenues
earned premiums
earned premiums of $11.33billion in 2011 were $561million, or 5%, higher than in 2010, primarily reflecting the impact
of an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. earned premiums in 2011 also benefited from positive audit premium adjustments related to increased insured exposures for
existing policyholders, compared with negative audit premium adjustments in 2010 related to decreased insured exposures for existing policyholders. in 2010, earned premiums of $10.77 billon were
$202million, or 2%, lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting reduced insured exposures due to lower levels of economic activity in 2010.
table of contents
net investment income
net investment income of $2.04billion in 2011 was $115million, or 5%, lower than in 2010. in 2010, net investment
income of $2.16billion was $254million, or 13% higher than in 2009. refer to the "net investment income" section of "consolidated results of operations" herein for a discussion of the
changes in the company's net investment income in 2011 and 2010 as compared with the respective prior year. in addition, refer to note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial
statements herein for a discussion of the company's net investment income allocation methodology.
fee income
national accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services
to large companies that choose to self-insure a portion of their insurance risks, as well as claims and policy management
services to workers' compensation residual market pools. fee income in 2011 increased by $10million, or 4%, over 2010, driven by strong business retention rates coupled with higher serviced
premium and claim volume in workers' compensation residual market pools. in 2010, fee income decreased $21million, or 7%, from 2009, primarily reflecting lower new business volume due to lower
levels of economic activity and lower serviced premium and claim volume due to the de-population of workers' compensation residual market pools. the decline in 2010 also reflected the
impact of both lower claim volume and lower loss costs (as fees are based either on the number of claims serviced or as a percentage of losses) driven by workers' compensation reforms, as well as
overall lower claim frequency and increased competition.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2011 were $8.45billion, $1.94billion, or 30%, higher than in 2010. the increase
in 2011 primarily reflected a significant decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and a significant increase in catastrophe losses, along with the impact of loss cost trends that
included slightly higher than expected loss costs in the workers' compensation and commercial auto product lines. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was $245million, compared
with $901million in 2010. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was primarily driven by better than expected loss development in the general liability product line (excluding
increases to asbestos and environmental reserves discussed below), which was concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2005-2008 and reflected what the company believes are more
favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected, as well as better than expected loss development for the 2008 and 2009 accident years in the property product line.
the workers' compensation line of business contributed slightly to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011, as favorable reserve development for the 2003-2009 accident years
was largely offset by net unfavorable reserve development for the 2010 accident year related to higher than expected loss frequency. these factors were partially offset by $175million and
$76million increases to asbestos and environmental reserves in 2011, respectively (discussed in further detail in the "asbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation"
sections herein), unfavorable prior year reserve development in the commercial multi-peril product line driven by higher than expected late reported hail claims from 2010 and unfavorable prior year
reserve development in the commercial automobile product line that reflected worse than expected severity for the 2009-2010 accident years. catastrophe losses in 2011 were
$1.02billion, compared with $437million in 2010. catastrophe losses in 2011 primarily resulted from winter storms and severe wind and hail storms throughout the united states, as well
as hurricane irene.
claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2010 were $6.50billion, $467million, or 8%, higher than in 2009. the increase in 2010 primarily reflected a significant increase
in catastrophe losses, a modest

decline
in net favorable prior year reserve development and the impact of loss cost trends. catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $437million and $176million, respectively.
catastrophe losses in 2010 primarily resulted from several severe wind and hail storms as well as severe winter storms. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 was
$901million and $1.03billion, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 was driven by better than expected loss development in the property, general liability
(excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves discussed below) and workers' compensation product lines for multiple accident years, as well as in assumed reinsurance, which is in runoff.
the property product line improvement primarily occurred in the 2008 and 2009 accident years as a result of better than expected loss development in industry-focused underwriting and target risk
underwriting. the general liability product line improvement was concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior and reflected what the company believes are more favorable legal and
judicial environments than what the company previously expected. net favorable prior year reserve development in the workers' compensation product line was concentrated in accident years 2007 and
prior and resulted from better than expected loss development. the improvement in assumed reinsurance resulted primarily from favorable resolutions of claims and disputes from accident years 2002 and
prior. in addition, better than expected loss development in the business insurance segment in recent years resulted in a favorable re-estimation of reserves for unallocated loss
adjustment expenses in 2010. the net favorable prior year reserve development in these product lines in 2010 was partially offset by $140million and $35million increases to asbestos
and environmental reserves, respectively (discussed in further detail in the "asbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation" sections herein).
net
favorable prior year reserve development in 2009 of $1.03billion was driven by better than expected loss development primarily concentrated in the general liability
(excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves discussed below), commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and commercial property product lines for recent accident years, reflecting
greater reductions in frequency than the company expected based upon long-term frequency trends that have been declining. the general liability and commercial multi-peril product lines
experienced better than anticipated loss development that was attributable to several factors, including what the company believes to be improved legal and judicial environments, as well as enhanced
risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. the commercial automobile line of business experienced better than expected loss development that was attributable to what the company
believes to be more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected, claim handling initiatives and improvements in auto safety technology. the commercial property
product line improvement primarily occurred in the 2007 and 2008 accident years as a result of better than expected loss development for certain large national property and inland marine exposures. in
addition, the commercial property product line's 2005 accident year experience improved due to the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, hurricane katrina. the net
favorable prior year reserve development in these product lines in 2009 was partially offset by $185million and $70million increases to asbestos reserves and environmental reserves,
respectively (discussed in more
detail in the "asbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation" sections herein).
amortization of deferred acquisition expenses
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2011 was $1.82billion, $66million, or 4%, higher than in 2010. the
amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 was $1.75billion, $26million, or 1%, lower than in 2009. the changes in both 2011 and 2010 were consistent with the changes in earned
premiums compared to the respective prior year.
table of contents
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses in 2011 were $1.94billion, $40million, or 2%, higher than in 2010, primarily driven
by a higher level of state assessment expenses related to workers' compensation business in new york, which more than offset an overall reduction in operating expenses.
general
and administrative expenses in 2010 were $1.90billion, $62million, or 3%, lower than in 2009. the 2009 total included a $38million reduction in the
estimate of property windpool assessments related to hurricane ike. adjusting for that reduction in 2009, general and administrative expenses in 2010 were $100million, or 5%, lower than in
2009, driven by a decline in loss-based assessments that reflected the impact of favorable prior year reserve development and favorable rate changes, as well as a decline in
employee-related expenses and a reduction in the amount of the company's corporate advertising expense allocated to this segment resulting from a change in focus to the personal insurance segment's
direct to consumer initiative in 2010.
gaap combined ratios
the gaap combined ratio of 104.7% in 2011 was 13.4 points higher than the gaap combined ratio of 91.3% in 2010.
in
2011, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 73.1% was 14.0 points higher than the 2010 ratio of 59.1%. catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 accounted for 9.0 points and 4.1
points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development provided 2.2 points and 8.4 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio in 2011 and 2010, respectively. the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011 excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 2.9 points higher than the 2010 ratio on
the same basis, reflecting the impact of loss cost trends described above.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 31.6% in 2011 was 0.6 points lower than the 2010 underwriting expense ratio, primarily reflecting the impact of higher earned premiums.
the
gaap combined ratio of 91.3% in 2010 was 5.2 points higher than the gaap combined ratio of 86.1% in 2009.
in
2010, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.1% was 5.2 points higher than the 2009 ratio of 53.9%. catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 accounted for 4.1 points and 1.6
points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development provided 8.4 points and 9.3 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio in 2010 and 2009, respectively. the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010 excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 1.8 points higher than the 2009 ratio on
the same basis, reflecting the impact of loss cost trends described above.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 32.2% in 2010 was level with the 2009 underwriting expense ratio. the underwriting expense ratio in 2009 included a 0.3 point benefit from the reduction
in the estimate of windpool assessments described above. adjusting for that factor in 2009, the underwriting expense ratio for 2010 was 0.3 points lower than the 2009 underwriting expense ratio. the
improvement in the 2010 adjusted underwriting expense ratio reflected the decline in expenses described above.

in
2011, gross and net written premiums both increased by 4% over 2010. the increase in gross and net written premiums in 2011 was concentrated in commercial accounts and
industry-focused underwriting and, to a lesser extent, in select accounts. gross and net written premiums were favorably impacted by positive audit premium adjustments in 2011, as compared with
negative adjustments in 2010. overall business retention rates remained strong in 2011 and were consistent with 2010. both components of renewal premium changesrenewal rate changes and
insured exposure growthwere positive in 2011 and improved over 2010. new business levels in 2011 declined modestly from 2010.
in
2010, gross and net written premiums decreased by 2% and less than 1%, respectively, from 2009. the difference in rates of decline between gross and net written premiums in 2010 was
concentrated in national accounts. a significant portion of gross written premiums for products offered by national accounts is ceded to other insurers and residual market pools. as a result, the
decline in gross written premiums did not have a proportional impact on net written premiums. the decline in gross and net written premiums in 2010 was driven in large part by lower levels of economic
activity that impacted exposure changes at renewal, audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations.
select accounts.net written premiums of $2.78billion in 2011 increased by 2% over 2010. business retention rates remained strong
and were
consistent with 2010. renewal premium changes, comprising both renewal rate changes and insured exposure growth, remained positive in 2011. renewal premium changes in 2011 were level with 2010, as
growth in renewal rate changes was offset by a lower
table of contents
level
of insured exposure growth. new business volume in 2011 declined from 2010. net written premiums of $2.72billion in 2010 decreased 1% from 2009. business retention rates in 2010 remained
strong but were slightly lower than in 2009. renewal premium changes remained positive in 2010 and
increased over 2009, reflecting positive renewal rate changes and modest exposure growth. new business volume in 2010 declined compared with 2009, driven by lower business volumes from larger accounts
where marketplace competition remained high.
commercial accounts.net written premiums of $2.89billion in 2011 increased by 12% over 2010. the increase was partially due to
the benefit
of positive audit premium adjustments, compared with negative adjustments in 2010. business retention rates remained strong, decreasing slightly in 2011 compared with 2010. renewal premium changes
were positive in 2011 and increased over 2010, primarily driven by positive renewal rate changes. new business volume in 2011 declined slightly from 2010. net written premiums of $2.58billion
in 2010 were 3% higher than in 2009. business retention rates in 2010 remained strong and increased slightly over 2009. renewal premium changes in 2010 were slightly positive, as positive renewal rate
changes were largely offset by a modest decline in exposures that reflected the impact of general economic conditions. new business levels also increased over 2009.
national accounts.net written premiums of $782million in 2011 decreased by 3% from 2010, primarily reflecting negative
retrospective premium
adjustments related to prior year policies. business retention rates remained high in 2011 and increased slightly over 2010, while renewal premium changes in 2011 also increased over 2010. new
business volume in 2011 declined slightly from 2010. net written premiums of $806million in 2010 were 11% lower than in 2009, reflecting reduced insurance exposures driven by lower levels of
economic activity, lower prior year retrospective premium adjustments and the loss of a large account. despite the loss of that account, business retention rates remained high in 2010.
industry-focused underwriting.net written premiums of $2.41billion in 2011 increased by 5% over 2010, primarily driven by growth
in
construction, oil& gas and technology. net written premiums of $2.30billion in 2010 increased 1% over 2009. premium growth in 2010 was concentrated in the technology, agribusiness and
oil& gas business units.
target risk underwriting.net written premiums of $1.59billion in 2011 increased slightly over 2010, as premium growth in inland
marine and
excess casualty was largely offset by a decline in national property. net written premiums of $1.57billion in 2010 were slightly higher than in 2009, as premium growth in the boiler&
machinery and inland marine business units was largely offset by a decline in national property premium volume.
specialized distribution.net written premiums of $880million in 2011 increased slightly over 2010, driven
by growth in the national programs business unit. net written premiums of $872million in 2010 were 2% lower than in 2009, primarily driven by negative renewal premium changes in both the
northland and national programs business units. business retention rates in both business units increased over 2009.

overview
operating income of $647million in 2011 was $27million, or 4%, higher than operating income in 2010, primarily
reflecting an increase in underwriting margins, partially offset by a decline in net investment income. the increase in underwriting margins was driven by higher net favorable prior year reserve
development, declines in catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses and a $14million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters,
partially offset by the impact of lower business volume, higher general and administrative expenses and a higher level of what the company defines as large losses. net favorable prior year reserve
development in 2011 was $360million, compared with $259million in 2010. catastrophe losses in 2011 were $55million, compared with $82million in 2010.
operating
income of $620million in 2010 was $22million, or 3%, lower than in 2009, primarily driven by increases in catastrophe losses, non-catastrophe
weather-related losses, and general and administrative expenses, as well as lower business volumes, which were partially offset by an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. net
favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 was $259million and $168million, respectively. catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $82million and
$3million, respectively.
revenues
earned premiums
earned premiums of $3.17billion in 2011 decreased by $143million, or 4%, from 2010. the decline primarily reflected the
impact of the termination of an exclusive broker relationship in the republic of ireland in the fourth quarter of 2010, lower construction surety premium volumes over the preceding twelve months,
intentional underwriting actions undertaken in the company's operations at lloyd's intended to improve risk and reward (particularly in the catastrophe-exposed lines of business) and competitive
market conditions. earned premiums in 2011 benefited slightly from the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. in addition, earned premiums in 2010 benefited from the impact of a
reduction in surety reinsurance costs associated with prior year reinsurance treaties.
table of contents
earned
premiums of $3.32billion in 2010 were slightly lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting the impact of intentional underwriting actions taken and competitive market
conditions in the professional liability business unit and in the company's operation at lloyd's. these factors were largely offset by lower reinsurance costs, the impact of changes in the structure
of the company's reinsurance during the first quarter of 2010 that modestly increased retentions to directionally align retentions in the company's international business with its u.s. practices, and
the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
net investment income
net investment income of $414million in 2011 decreased by $25million, or 6%, compared with 2010. in 2010, net
investment income of $439million declined by $13million, or 3%, from 2009. included in the financial, professional& international insurance segment are certain legal entities
whose invested assets and related net investment income are reported exclusively in this
segment and not allocated among all business segments. as a result, reported net investment income in the financial, professional& international insurance segment reflects a significantly
smaller proportion of allocated net investment income, including that from the company's non-fixed maturity investments that experienced a substantial increase in investment income in
2010. refer to the "net investment income" section of "consolidated results of operations" herein for a discussion of the change in the company's consolidated net investment income in 2011 and 2010 as
compared with the respective prior years. in addition, refer to note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company's net investment income
allocation methodology.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2011 were $1.49billion, $213million, or 13%, lower than in 2010, primarily
reflecting an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development, a decline in catastrophe losses, lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and lower business volume, partially
offset by a higher level of large losses. net favorable prior year reserve development was $360million and $259million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. both bond& financial
products and international contributed to the net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011. in bond& financial products, net favorable development in 2011 primarily reflected better
than expected results for accident years 2008 and prior for the contract surety business, and better than expected loss development for liability lines of business, driven by the fiduciary product for
accident years 2008 and prior. in international, net favorable development in 2011 reflected better than expected loss development in canada, primarily in the surety, directors and officers, and
general liability lines of business for recent accident years and better than expected development in the company's operation at lloyd's in the aviation, kidnap& ransom, and property lines for
recent accident years. catastrophe losses in 2011 were $55million, compared with $82million in 2010. catastrophe losses in 2011 included losses from floods in thailand and an
earthquake in japan. catastrophe losses in 2010 primarily resulted from an earthquake in chile.
claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2010 were $1.70billion, $47million, or 3%, lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in net favorable prior year
reserve development, partially offset by increases in catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses. in addition, the 2009 total included an increase in reserves for a
non-renewed professional liability program in the republic of ireland. net favorable prior year reserve development was $259million and $168million in 2010 and 2009,
respectively. in bond& financial products, net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 was driven by better than expected loss development in the surety and management liability lines
of business due to lower than expected claim activity and loss severity in the 2008 and prior accident years. in international, the majority of net favorable prior year reserve
development in 2010 occurred at the company's operation at lloyd's, in canada and in the united kingdom. net favorable prior year
table of contents
reserve
development in 2009 was driven by better than expected loss development in international, particularly in the united kingdom and canada. in addition, the aviation and property lines of
business at lloyd's experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009. in bond& financial products, better than expected loss development for the contract surety business within
the fidelity and surety product line for recent accident years also resulted in net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009. catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $82million and
$3million, respectively.
amortization of deferred acquisition costs
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was $603million in 2011, $9million, or 1%, lower than in 2010. the
decrease in 2011 was less than the decrease in earned premiums, primarily due to the increase to earned premiums in 2010 as a result of a reduction in surety reinsurance costs associated with prior
year reinsurance treaties. the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was $612million in 2010, $10million, or 2%, lower than in 2009, consistent with the decline in earned premiums
when factoring in the impact on earned premiums in 2010 of the reduction in surety reinsurance costs associated with prior year reinsurance treaties.
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses of $648million in 2011 were $40million, or 7%, higher than in 2010. general and
administrative expenses of $608million in 2010 were $29million, or 5%, higher than the 2009 total of $579million. the increases in both 2011 and 2010 primarily reflecting
increases in employee- and technology-related costs in international to enhance operations and support future business growth.
gaap combined ratios
the gaap combined ratio of 85.8% in 2011 was 1.9 points lower than the gaap combined ratio of 87.7% in 2010.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 46.4% in 2011 was 4.5 points lower than the 2010 ratio of 50.9%. catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 accounted for 1.7 and 2.4 points of the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development provided 11.3 points and 7.8 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011
and 2010, respectively. the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011 excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 0.3 points lower than the 2010 ratio on the same basis,
reflecting the factors discussed above.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 39.4% in 2011 was 2.6 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 36.8% in 2010. the increase in 2011 primarily reflected lower earned premium
volumes in international and construction surety and the increase in general and administrative expenses discussed above.
the
gaap combined ratio of 87.7% in 2010 was 0.4 points lower than the gaap combined ratio of 88.1% in 2009.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 50.9% in 2010 was 1.2 points lower than the 2009 ratio of 52.1%. catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 accounted for 2.4 and 0.1 points of the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development provided 7.8 points and 5.1 points of benefit, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010
and 2009, respectively. the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2010 excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 0.8 points lower than the 2009 ratio on the same basis,
reflecting the factors discussed above.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 36.8% in 2010 was 0.8 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 36.0% in 2009, primarily reflecting the increase in general and
administrative expenses discussed above.

with 2009.
net
written premiums of $1.95billion in bond& financial products in 2011 were $28million, or 1%, lower than in 2010, reflecting lower construction surety premium
volume due to the continued slowdown in construction spending, and disciplined underwriting. the decrease also reflected the impact of reductions in surety reinsurance costs in 2010 associated with
prior year reinsurance treaties. excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures, business retention rates in 2011 remained strong and were higher than in
2010. renewal premium changes in 2011 were slightly positive (compared with slightly negative in 2010), as the modest growth in insured exposures exceeded negative renewal rate changes. new business
volume in 2011 increased considerably over 2010.
net
written premiums of $1.98billion in bond& financial products in 2010 were $59million, or 3% lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting the impact of
underwriting actions taken and competitive market conditions in the professional liability and public company liability business units. in addition, construction and commercial surety net written
premium volume declined in 2010 compared with 2009, reflecting the impact of the economic downturn. these factors were partially offset by a reduction in reinsurance costs. excluding the surety line
of business, business retention rates in 2010 were strong and slightly higher than in 2009. renewal premium changes in 2010 were negative, reflecting both a decline in renewal rate changes and reduced
insured exposures due to intentional underwriting actions taken and lower levels of economic activity. new business volume in 2010 declined from 2009, which reflected increasingly competitive market
conditions in 2010.
net
written premiums of $1.15billion in international in 2011 were $81million, or 7%, lower than in 2010, primarily reflecting the company's withdrawal from personal
insurance business in the republic of ireland during the preceding twelve months. excluding the surety line of business, business retention rates in 2011 declined from 2010, primarily as a result of
the company's withdrawal from personal insurance business in the republic of ireland. new business volume in international in 2011 decreased from 2010, primarily reflecting the company's withdrawal
from personal insurance business in the republic of ireland and intentional underwriting actions in the company's operations at lloyd's. renewal premium changes in 2011 were flat in 2011 (compared
with slightly positive in 2010), as positive renewal rate changes were offset by a decline in insured exposures.
table of contents
net
written premiums of $1.23billion in international in 2010 were $15million, or 1%, lower than in 2009, primarily reflecting the impact of intentional underwriting
actions and competitive market conditions. those factors were largely offset by changes in the structure of the company's reinsurance that modestly increased retentions to directionally align
retentions in the company's international business with its u.s. practices, as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. in late 2008, the company commenced an exclusive
relationship with a broker in the republic of ireland that significantly increased the 2009 volume of personal automobile coverage written and also resulted in the company writing personal household
coverages. the company ceased writing business through this relationship in the fourth quarter of 2010. excluding the surety line of business, retention rates in 2010 declined from 2009. new business
volume also declined in 2010, primarily due to intentional underwriting actions and the termination of a broker relationship in the republic of ireland. renewal premium changes were slightly positive
in 2010, driven by positive renewal rate changes, partially offset by reduced insured exposures.

overview
an operating loss of ($332) million in 2011 compared with operating income of $440million in 2010. this decline in operating
income was primarily driven by a significant increase in catastrophe losses, along with lower underlying underwriting margins related to earned pricing and loss cost trends, higher than expected
non-catastrophe weather-related losses, lower net investment income and an increase in expenses related to the company's direct to consumer initiative. these factors were partially offset
by the favorable impact of increased business volumes, an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development and a $10million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various
prior year tax matters. catastrophe losses in 2011 were $1.49billion, compared with $594million in 2010. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was $110million,
compared with $87million in 2010.
in
2010, operating income of $440million was $161million, or 27%, lower than in 2009. the decline primarily reflected the significant increase in catastrophe losses, a
decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and an increase in expenses related to the company's direct to consumer initiative. these factors were partially offset by increases in net
investment income and business
table of contents
volume,
the favorable impact of earned pricing and loss cost trends, as well as a reduction in non-catastrophe weather-related losses. in addition, operating income in 2009 included a
$48million reduction in the estimate of property windpool assessments related to hurricane ike that had been recorded in general and administrative expenses in 2008. catastrophe losses in 2010
and 2009 were $594million and $278million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 was $87million and $135million, respectively.
revenues
earned premiums
earned premiums of $7.59billion in 2011 were $240million, or 3%, higher than in 2010. earned premiums of
$7.35billion in 2010 were $232million, or 3%, higher than in 2009. the increases in both years primarily reflected an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.
net investment income
net investment income of $424million in 2011 decreased by $40million, or 9%, from 2010. in 2010, net investment income
of $464million increased by $42million, or 10%, over 2009. refer to the "net investment income" section of "consolidated results of operations" herein for a discussion of the change in
the company's net investment income in 2011 and 2010 as compared with the respective prior year. in addition, refer to note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a
discussion of the company's net investment income allocation methodology.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses of $6.34billion in 2011 were $1.34billion, or 27%, higher than in 2010. the
increase primarily reflected the significant increase in catastrophe losses, along with the impact of loss cost trends, higher than expected non-catastrophe weather-related losses and
higher business volumes. these factors were partially offset by an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 were $1.49billion and
$594million, respectively. catastrophe losses in 2011 included the impact of multiple tornadoes and hail storms, primarily in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states, as well as
hurricane irene. catastrophe losses in 2010 resulted from several severe wind and hail storms. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 and 2010 was $110million and
$87million, respectively. the 2011 total was driven by better than expected loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in the first half of 2010, as well as better than expected
loss development in the 2006-2010 accident years for the umbrella line of business in the homeowners and other product line, partially offset by worse than expected loss development in the
automobile product line for the 2007-2010 accident years.
claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2010 were $5.01billion, $382million, or 8%, higher than in 2009. the total in 2010 reflected the significant increase in
catastrophe losses, the reduction in net favorable prior year reserve development and increased business volume, partially offset by a decline in non-catastrophe weather-related losses and
improved loss cost trends. catastrophe losses in 2010 and 2009 were $594million and $278million, respectively. catastrophe losses in 2009 primarily resulted from several wind and hail
storms, as well as flooding. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 and 2009 was $87million and $135million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in
2010 was concentrated in the homeowners and other product line, primarily driven by favorable loss development in the 2008 and prior accident years, primarily for the umbrella line of business,
partially offset by unfavorable loss development in the 2009 accident year for the homeowners line of business that was driven by higher than anticipated late-reported claims related to
storms in
table of contents
2009.
net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009 primarily reflected favorable loss development related to hurricanes ike and katrina, as well as the 2007 california wildfires.
amortization of deferred acquisition costs
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was $1.46million in 2011, $17million, or 1%, higher than in 2010. the
increase in 2011 was less than the increase in earned premiums, primarily reflecting an increase in the number of agents reverting to a contingent commission compensation program (the costs of which
are classified in "general and administrative expenses") from a fixed-value compensation program (the costs of which are classified in "amortization of deferred acquisition costs"). the amortization
of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 was $1.44billion, $25million, or 2%, higher than in 2009. the increase in 2010 was consistent with the increase in earned premiums.
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses of $908million in 2011 were $41million, or 5%, higher than in 2010. the increase in
2011 was primarily driven by costs associated with the company's direct to consumer initiative, as well as the increase in contingent commission expense due to the increase in the number of agents
reverting to a contingent commission compensation program. the cost of the contingent commission program is not subject to deferred acquisition cost accounting treatment and, therefore, is expensed as
incurred.
general
and administrative expenses of $867million in 2010 were $83million, or 11%, higher than in 2009. the total in 2009 reflected a $48million reduction in the
estimate of property windpool assessments related to hurricane ike, which occurred in 2008. adjusting for the impact of the reduction in windpool assessments in 2009, general and administrative
expenses in 2010 increased $35million, or 4%, over 2009, primarily reflecting growth in business volume and continued costs supporting business growth and product development, including the
company's direct to consumer initiative.
gaap combined ratio
the gaap combined ratio of 113.6% in 2011 was 15.3 points higher than the gaap combined ratio of 98.3% in 2010.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 83.5% in 2011 was 15.4 points higher than the 2010 ratio of 68.1%. catastrophe losses accounted for 19.6 and 8.1 points of the loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio in 2011 and 2010, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development provided 1.5 points and 1.2 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in
2011 and 2010, respectively. the 2011 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development was 4.2 points higher than the 2010 ratio on the same
basis, primarily reflecting the impact of higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 30.1% in 2011 was 0.1 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 30.2% in 2010. the slight decline in the underwriting expense ratio for 2011
compared with 2010 reflected growth in earned premiums and increases in costs associated with the company's direct to consumer initiative, the impacts of which were largely offsetting.
the
gaap combined ratio of 98.3% in 2010 was 3.7 points higher than the gaap combined ratio of 94.6% in 2009.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 68.1% in 2010 was 3.1 points higher than the 2009 ratio of 65.0%. catastrophe losses accounted for 8.1 and 3.9 points of the loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio in 2010 and 2009, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development provided 1.2 points and 1.9 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in
2010 and 2009, respectively. the 2010 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior
table of contents
year
reserve development was 1.8 points lower than the 2009 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 30.2% in 2010 was 0.6 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.6% in 2009. the 2009 underwriting expense ratio included a 0.7 point
benefit from the reduction in the estimate of windpool assessments described above.

the
operating loss for interest expense and other in 2011 was $39million lower than in 2010, primarily reflecting $39million of expenses related to the company's purchase

asbestos claims and litigation
the company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have
expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. the company continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the
company's policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy), including claims against the company's policyholders by individuals who do not appear to be impaired by asbestos
exposure. factors underlying these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on previously peripheral defendants. the focus on these
defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. in addition to contributing to the overall number of
claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments
by insurers, including the company. the bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in
the tort system. currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the
courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. this trend of prioritizing claims involving credible
evidence of injuries, along with the focus on previously peripheral defendants, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payments experienced by the company. the company's
asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through
exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers.
the
company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or
a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. in these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated
as a separate occurrence under the policy. it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor
and other company defenses are not successful, the company's coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable
per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. accordingly, although the company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with
these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims.
table of contents
many
coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of
settlement negotiations. settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than
originally anticipated. there also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement, which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the
company. as in the past, the company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.
in
addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to
the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. it is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers,
including the company, could be made in the future. it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers
based on novel legal theories of liability. the company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.
travelers
property casualty corp. (tpc), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, had entered into settlement agreements, which are subject to a number of contingencies, in connection
with a number of these direct action claims. for a full discussion of these settlement agreements, including subsequent appeals and court decisions that have delayed their implementation, see the
"asbestos direct action litigation" section of note15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
because
each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. among the factors
which the company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; limits
and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement
values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in
any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject
to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.
the
company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder
bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. the company also analyzes developing payment patterns among
policyholders in the home office, field office and assumed reinsurance and other categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. in addition, the company reviews its historical
gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity.
conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves nor have the company's evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity
payment.
in
the third quarter of 2011, the company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review and noted the following
trends:
continued high level of litigation activity involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness;
an increase in severity for certain policyholders as a result of the continued high level of litigation activity;
stable payment patterns for a significant proportion of policyholders;
table of contents
a further decrease in the number of large asbestos exposures confronting the company due to additional settlement
activity;
continued moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity; and
the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants.
while
the company believes that over the past several years there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the company's overall asbestos exposure, there nonetheless
remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims.
as
in prior years, the annual claim review considered active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and "non-product" liability. while the home office and
field office categories, which account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, experienced a slight reduction in the number of policyholders with open asbestos
claims compared with the prior year period, gross asbestos-related payments in these categories increased slightly in 2011 compared with 2010. payments on behalf of policyholders in these categories
continue to be influenced by the high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury continue to target previously
peripheral defendants.
the
completion of these reviews and analyses in 2011 and 2010 resulted in $175million and $140million increases, respectively, in the company's net asbestos reserves,
primarily driven by increases in the company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders and higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance
accounts. the increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from recent payment trends being moderately higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the
current litigation environment discussed above. notwithstanding these trends, the company's overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods. the
increase in 2010 also reflected increases in costs of litigating asbestos-related coverage matters and was partially offset by a $70million benefit from the reduction in the allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance resulting from a favorable ruling related to a reinsurance dispute. in 2009, the company recorded a $185million increase in asbestos reserves, primarily driven by a
slight increase in the company's assumption for projected defense costs related to many policyholders.
net
asbestos losses paid in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $284million, $350million and $341million, respectively. the decrease in gross and net paid losses in 2011
primarily resulted from completing, during 2010, the final installment payments on a previously reserved settlement. approximately 19%, 32% and 41% of total net paid losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively, related to policyholders with whom the company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the company's liability.

the
"policyholders with settlement agreements" category includes structured settlements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to tpc, wellington accounts. reserves are based
on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. structured settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be
paid at
table of contents
scheduled
times. included in this category are tpc's reserves for the settlements of the statutory and hawaii actions and the common law claims, which are described in the "asbestos direct action
litigation" section of note15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be
provided. payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. wellington accounts refer to the 35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement
settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. many of the aspects of the wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the
parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed.
the
"home office and field office" category relates to all other policyholders and also includes unallocated ibnr reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related
coverage litigation. policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified
threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential "non-product" exposures, size of policyholder and
geographic distribution of
products or services sold by the policyholder. in addition to ibnr amounts contained in the reserves for "home office and field office" policyholders and the costs of litigating asbestos coverage
matters, the company has established a reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders, new claims from policyholders reporting claims for the first time and policyholders
for which there is, or may be, litigation and direct actions against the company. the "assumed reinsurance and other" category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various
pool participations.
on
january29, 2009, the company and ppg industries, inc ("ppg"), along with approximately 30 other insurers of ppg, agreed in principle to an agreement to settle asbestos-related
coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to ppg. the tentative settlement agreement has been incorporated into the modified third amended plan of reorganization ("amended plan") proposed as
part of the pittsburgh corning corp. ("pcc", which is 50% owned by ppg) bankruptcy proceeding. pursuant to the proposed amended plan, which was filed on january30, 2009, pcc, along with
enumerated other companies (including ppg as well as the company as a participating insurer), are to receive protections afforded by section524(g) of the bankruptcy code from certain
asbestos-related bodily injury claims. under the agreement in principle, the company has the option to make a series of payments over the next 20years totaling approximately
$620million to the trust to be created under the amended plan, or it may elect to make a one-time discounted payment, which, as of march31, 2012, would total approximately
$468million (approximately $439million after reinsurance). the agreement in principle with ppg is subject to numerous contingencies, including final court approval of the amended plan,
and the company has no obligation to make the settlement payment until all contingencies are satisfied. the company's obligations under this agreement in principle are included in the "home office and
field office" category in the preceding table.

environmental claims and litigation
the company continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their
alleged disposition of toxic substances. mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. for instance, the comprehensive
environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to
releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own
remedial action. liability under cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties.
the
company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. the company believes that some court decisions
have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. these decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the company
prior to the mid-1980s. these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount
being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.
the
resolution of environmental exposures by the company generally occurs by settlement on a policyholder-by-policyholder basis as opposed to a
claim-by-claim basis. generally, the company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future
environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. this form of settlement is commonly referred to as a "buy-back" of policies for
future environmental liability. in addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance
table of contents
obligation
which the company may have for other claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. the company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which
extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. where appropriate, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the company. the company's
general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related
costs.
in
establishing environmental reserves, the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. in the course of this analysis,
the company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures. in addition, the company considers the many
variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature
of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall
nature of the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of
other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential
non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. the evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information
concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves.
in
its review of environmental reserves, the company considers: past settlement payments; changing judicial and legislative trends; its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental
coverage matters; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up actions for both on- and off-site waste disposal activities;
the potential for adverse development; the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements.
the
duration of the company's investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the
company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. these factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of
underlying litigation or claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the company and the willingness of the policyholder and the company to negotiate, if appropriate,
a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and policyholder-by-policyholder, the company
cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim. however, based upon the company's experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several
years.
the
company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time. these policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower
tier defendants. further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient
clean-up technologies. over the past several years, the company has experienced generally favorable trends in overall environmental claim payments, in the number of new policyholders
tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. however, in 2011, the company increased its net
environmental reserves by $76million, primarily because the degree to which those favorable trends continued was less than anticipated. in 2010, the company increased its net environmental
reserves by $35million due to a modest upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders. the company increased its net environmental
reserves by $70million in 2009, due to a slight increase in the number of
table of contents
policyholders
tendering claims for the first time and upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders.
net
environmental losses paid in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $86million, $77million and $91million, respectively. at december31, 2011, approximately 93% of
the net environmental reserve (approximately $316million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the
anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. the bulk reserve the company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process
environmental claims and the company's experience in resolving those claims. the balance, approximately 7% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $25million), consists of case
reserves.

uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves
as a result of the processes and procedures described above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and
environmental claims at december31, 2011 are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. however, the uncertainties surrounding the final
resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject to
revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any
impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and
environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of
available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the company,
future developments pertaining to the company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to
table of contents
policyholders,
whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. in addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of
policyholders and other defendants. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and
environmental claims. this environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges
to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until
settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in
bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental
reserves, the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments. (also see note15 of notes to the consolidated financial statements).
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, the company's estimate of claims and
claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that
could be material to the company's operating results in future periods.
investment portfolio
the company's invested assets at december31, 2011 were $72.70billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and
short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate and 5% in other investments. because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments,
the company employs a conservative investment philosophy. a significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid taxable u.s.
government, tax-exempt u.s. municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds.
the
carrying value of the company's fixed maturity portfolio at december31, 2011 was $64.23billion. the company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity
investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the company's insurance and debt obligations. the weighted average credit
quality of the company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding u.s. treasury securities, was "aa2" at both december31, 2011 and 2010. standard& poor's recent downgrade
of the credit rating of securities issued by the u.s. government had minimal impact on the overall credit quality of the company's fixed maturity portfolio at december31, 2011. below
investment grade securities represented 3.1% and 3.0% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the average effective duration of fixed
maturities and short-term securities was 3.2 (3.4 excluding short-term securities) at december31, 2011 and 3.6 (3.9 excluding short-term securities) at
december31, 2010. the decline in duration reflected the impact of declining market yields on existing holdings of municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities (which impact the assumptions
related to optional pre-payments and the related estimate of effective duration for callable securities).

the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2011 and 2010 included $39.02billion and
$39.54billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). the municipal
bond portfolio is diversified across the united states, the district of columbia and puerto rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts
and similar issuers. included in the municipal bond portfolio at december31, 2011 and 2010 were $7.33billion and $7.29billion, respectively, of advance refunded or
escrowed-to-maturity bonds (collectively referred to as pre-refunded bonds), which are bonds for which an irrevocable trust has been established to fund the
remaining payments of principal and interest. such escrow accounts are verified as to their sufficiency by an external auditor and are almost exclusively comprised of u.s. treasury securities. moody's
investors service has assigned negative outlooks to municipal securities in both the state sector and local government sector within the united states.

the
company bases its investment decision on the underlying credit characteristics of the municipal security. while its municipal bond portfolio includes a number of securities that were
enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default, the company does not rely on enhanced credit characteristics provided by such third-party
insurance. the downgrade during 2008 and 2009 of credit ratings of insurers of these securities resulted in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of many such securities to the underlying rating of
the respective security. of the insured municipal securities in the company's investment portfolio at december31, 2011, approximately 99% were rated at a3 or above, and approximately 92% were
rated at aa3 or above, without the benefit of insurance. the company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the company's results of
operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities, as well as the company's ability and intent to hold the securities. the average
credit rating of the underlying issuers of these securities was "aa2" at december31, 2011. the average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was "aa1" at december31,
2011 with and without the enhancement provided by third-party insurance.

using external rating agencies or by the company when a public rating does not exist. the table includes $150million of short-term
securities which have the highest ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. for purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated
"a-1+" and/or "p-1," are included as "aaa" rated securities.
on
january13, 2012, standard& poor's downgraded the sovereign ratings of nine eurozone countries, including france (from "aaa" to "aa+"), austria (from "aaa" to "aa+"),
and spain (from "aa-" to "a"). on january27, 2012, fitch downgraded the sovereign ratings of five eurozone countries, including spain (from "aa-" to "a"). if these
downgrades were in effect at december31, 2011, the average credit rating of spain for "debt securities issued by foreign governments" in the foregoing table would have been "a2." the
downgrades of the remaining four countries did not alter their average credit quality ratings shown in the foregoing table.
in
addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the company has exposure totaling $262million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships
(both of which are included in other investments in the company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across europe. the company has unfunded commitments totaling
$134million to these partnerships. the company also has $4million of nonredeemable preferred stock (included in equity securities on the company's consolidated balance sheet) issued by
companies in the eurozone.
mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities
the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2011 and 2010 included $3.52billion and
$4.16billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities including
table of contents
pass-through-securities
and collateralized mortgage obligations (cmo), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). while prepayment risk for
both guaranteed and non-guaranteed securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the company's investment strategy
generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges. included in the totals at december31, 2011 and 2010 were $1.82billion and $2.09billion,
respectively, of gnma, fnma and fhlmc (excluding fha project loans) guaranteed residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities classified as available for sale. also included in those
totals were residential cmos classified as available for sale with a fair value of $1.70billion and $2.07billion, at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
approximately
38% of the company's cmo holdings were guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by gnma, fnma or fhlmc at both december31, 2011 and 2010. the
average credit rating of the $1.05billion and $1.28billion of non-guaranteed cmo holdings at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, was "ba1" and "baa1,"
respectively. the average credit rating of all of the above securities was "aa3" and "aa1" at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
the
company makes investments in residential cmos that are either guaranteed by gnma, fnma or fhlmc, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective
securitizations. both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential cmos allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. in
addition, non-guaranteed residential cmos provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. senior and super-senior cmos are protected, to
varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. the company's investment strategy is to purchase cmo tranches that are expected to offer the
most favorable return given the company's assessment of associated risks. the company does not purchase residual interests in cmos.
commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans
at december31, 2011 and 2010, the company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including fha project loans) of
$446million and $549million, respectively. the company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or
liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities.
alternative documentation mortgages and sub-prime mortgages
at december31, 2011 and 2010, the "mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through
securities" and "asset-backed and other" categories in the foregoing table included collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages and asset-backed securities
collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a collective fair value of $351million and $297million, respectively (comprising approximately 0.5% of the company's total fixed
maturity investments at both dates). the disruption in secondary investment markets provided the company with the opportunity to selectively acquire additional mortgage-backed securities at discounted
prices. the company purchased $128million and $31million of such securities in the years ended december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the company defines
sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: low fico scores, above-prime interest
rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the underlying loans
primarily meet the government-sponsored entities' requirements for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entities' guidelines for documentation, property type, debt and
loan-to-value ratios. the average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the company was "baa2" at both december31, 2011 and 2010.

other investments
at december31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of the company's other investments was $3.45billion and
$2.93billion, respectively. the company's other investments are primarily comprised of private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships, joint ventures, mortgage
loans, venture capital (through direct ownership and limited partnerships) and trading securities, which are subject to more volatility than the company's fixed maturity investments. these asset
classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. net investment income provided by these asset classes was $292million and
$304million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared with negative net investment income of $106million in 2009. the negative net investment income in 2009 reflected market conditions.
securities lending
the company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its
investments to other institutions for short periods of time. the company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended december31, 2011, 2010 and
2009.

fixed maturities portfolio at december31, 2011 experienced an increase in valuation compared with the prior year-end, primarily due to the continuing decline in market interest
rates. the company's fixed maturities and equity securities portfolios at december31, 2010 experienced increases in valuations compared with the prior year-end, which were offset
by a decrease in net unrealized appreciation on other investments that primarily resulted from the company's sale of substantially all of its common stock holdings in verisk analytics,inc.
that sale generated a pretax realized investment gain of $205million in 2010.

catastrophe modeling
the company uses various analyses and methods, including computer modeling processes, to analyze catastrophic events and the risks
associated with them. the company uses these analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. there are no industry-standard
methodologies or assumptions for projecting
table of contents
catastrophe
exposure. accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.
during
the first quarter of 2011, a new version of a third-party proprietary computer model utilized by the company, as well as others in the insurance industry, to estimate potential
aggregate hurricane losses was released. after evaluating multiple third-party models and calibrating its own historical loss experience and underwriting practices, the company increased its estimated
modeled loss, using its own proprietary modeling processes, from a single u.s. hurricane by a range of 10% to 24%. for each modeled event, the percentage magnitude of the loss increase within this
range will vary based on this evaluation.
the
tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts
(expressed in dollars and as a percentage of the company's common equity), based on the current version of the proprietary computer model utilized by the company at december31, 2011. for
example, on the basis described below the tables, the company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the company's loss from a single u.s. hurricane in a one-year timeframe
would equal or exceed $1.4billion, or 6% of the company's common equity at december31, 2011.

(1)an
event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a "1-in-50year event." as noted
above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not
over a multi-year timeframe. also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular
period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe.
(2)the
percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a)indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b)total common equity excluding net
unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes. net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily
indicative of operating trends. accordingly, the company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane
or single earthquake on the company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.
table of contents
the threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the company's in-force portfolio at december31, 2011 and catastrophic
reinsurance program at january1, 2012, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude most loss adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates.
the amounts for hurricanes reflect u.s. exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. the amounts for
earthquakes reflect u.s. and canadian exposures and include property exposures and workers' compensation exposures. the company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses
arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.
catastrophe
modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. these inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may
result in volatility in the modeled output. catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. catastrophe
modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. consequently, catastrophe
modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. in the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of
exceedance decreases. in other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. actual
losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. in addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.
moreover,
the company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed
to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, volcanic eruptions and acts of
terrorism. for these other perils, in contrast to hurricanes and earthquakes, models are less widely used, or are not used, by the company and by the industry. further, compared to models for
hurricanes and earthquakes, models, if any, for the other perils are newer, less reliable (given the even greater difficulty of predicting the risks) and not as extensively tested.
for
more information about the company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see "item1arisk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect
our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and
"item1arisk factorswe may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results."
changing climate conditions
severe weather events over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created
uncertainty regarding insurers' exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophe and other weather-related events. some scientists believe that, in recent years, changing climate conditions have
added to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters. accordingly, if climate conditions change in the future, the company's catastrophe models may be less reliable.
the
company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under "risk factors" in item1a of this report and under
"outlook" herein. for example, among other things:
increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under
policies issued by the company. see "risk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could
adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and "outlookunderwriting gain/loss."
table of contents
changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the company invests.
for example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers in the southwestern united states, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of
issuers in the southeastern united states, among other areas. see "risk factorsour investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses."
increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the company and its
customers. for example, state insurance regulation could impact the company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. if the company is unable to
implement risk based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased
losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. see "risk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or
liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance."
the full range of potential liability exposures related to climate change continues to evolve. through the company's
emerging issues committee and its committee on climate, energy and the environment, the company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess
climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. see "risk factorsthe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our
business are uncertain."
climate
change regulation also could increase the company's customers' costs of doing business. for example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less
available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. also, increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity, which would
decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses.
the
company regularly reviews emerging issues, such as changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help
determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products.
reinsurance recoverables
ceded reinsurance involves credit risk, except with regard to mandatory pools for which liability is mostly joint and several, and is
generally subject to aggregate loss limits. although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks
reinsured. reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts. the company also holds collateral, including trust agreements,
escrow funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. the company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements
periodically. reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices and the price of their product offerings. after reinsurance is purchased, the company has limited ability
to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer. in addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the european union and the united kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance
arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority.
the
company has also entered into master security agreements with certain reinsurers. these agreements define conditions that require the reinsurer to provide collateral. the specific
conditions and the amounts and form of collateral to be provided by these agreements vary based on a number of

holdings, inc. has entered into a merger agreement with alleghany corporation in a transaction expected to be finalized in the first quarter
of 2012.
at
december31, 2011, the company held $1.9billion of collateral in the form of letters of credit, trust agreements and funds held to fully or partially collateralize
certain reinsurance recoverables.
also
included in reinsurance recoverables are certain amounts related to structured settlements, which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain
personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the
life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the company's consolidated balance sheet as a liability and as a reinsurance recoverable, as the company retains the
contingent liability to the claimant. in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the company would be required to make such payments if and to the extent
the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. the following table presents the company's top five groups

reinsurance
companies and life insurance companies continued to be negatively impacted by turbulent economic conditions, significant catastrophe events and investment portfolio
challenges during 2011. a number of such companies have been subjected to downgrades and/or negative outlook changes by various ratings agencies, including those with which the company conducts
business. the company considers these factors in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts.
outlook
the following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the company's results of operations and capital
position.
premiums.the company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. net written premiums comprise both renewal
business and new
business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. when business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease
(renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the company considers as a measure of units of exposure. net written premiums from both renewal
and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of the business insurance
segment, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. net written premiums are also impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related
costs.
given
the possibility that more active weather patterns such as the company experienced in 2011 and 2010 may continue, as well as the possibility that interest rates may remain low for
some period of time, along with the current level of profitability in certain of its product lines, the company is undertaking efforts to improve its underwriting margins. these efforts include
seeking improved rates, as well as improved terms and conditions on many of its insurance products, and may also include other initiatives, such as reducing operating expenses and acquisition costs.
these efforts may not be successful and may result in lower retention and new business levels and therefore lower business volumes. nonetheless, the company currently expects retention levels (the
amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong relative to historical experience. the company also expects to continue to achieve renewal
price increases during 2012. in the business insurance segment, the company expects a continued increase in renewal premium
changes, including increases in both of its components of rate changes and, subject to the economic uncertainties described below, insured exposures, during 2012, compared with 2011. in the financial,
professional& international insurance segment, the company expects that renewal premium changes, primarily due to the insured exposure component, will modestly improve during 2012 compared
with 2011. in the personal insurance segment, the company expects both agency automobile and agency homeowners and other renewal premium changes during 2012 will remain positive and will be slightly
higher than in 2011 based on the company's actions to file for rate increases. the need for state
table of contents
regulatory
approval for changes to personal property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium changes.
the
pricing environment for new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal rate changes, given the volume of new business relative to renewal
business. property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2012 for new business, not only in business insurance and financial, professional & international
insurance, but also in personal insurance, where price comparison technology used by agents and brokers, sometimes referred to as "comparative raters", has increased the focus on price over other
competitive factors. see "risk factorsthe intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability." in addition, the
company launched a new distribution channel in 2009 that markets personal insurance products directly to consumers, which is expected to generate modest growth in premium volume for personal insurance
during 2012.
current
economic conditions have been somewhat volatile and there is increased uncertainty as to whether the u.s. or the global economy will grow modestly, remain stagnant or enter a
recession. economic growth experienced in 2011 may or may not continue, or may continue at a slower rate for an extended period of time. in addition, some economic conditions, such as the commercial
and residential real estate environment and employment rates, may continue to be weak. if weak economic conditions persist or deteriorate, the resulting low levels of economic activity could impact
exposure changes at renewal and the company's ability to write business at acceptable rates. additionally, low levels of economic activity could adversely impact audit premium adjustments, policy
endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. all of the foregoing, in turn, could adversely impact net written premiums during 2012 and, since earned premiums lag
net written premiums, earned premiums could be adversely impacted during and following 2012.
underwriting gain/loss.the company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or
unfavorable
prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins.
catastrophe
and other weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. the company experienced significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses in 2011
which adversely impacted its results of operations. the company's results of operations would continue to be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses were to
occur during 2012.
the
company utilizes a general catastrophe reinsurance treaty with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage its exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes. in addition to the coverage
provided under this treaty, the company also utilizes a catastrophe bond program, as well as a northeast catastrophe reinsurance treaty, to protect against certain losses resulting from catastrophes
in the northeastern united states. for additional information regarding the company's catastrophe reinsurance program, see "item1businessreinsurance" in this report.
as
discussed in more detail in item1, the attachment point for index-based losses and the maximum limit of the company's catastrophe bond program are reset annually to maintain
modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss on the respective catastrophe bonds equal to the initial modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss. for the period may1, 2012
through april30, 2013, the attachment point for the index-based losses and the maximum limit will be based on the new version of the third-party proprietary computer model used to estimate
potential hurricane losses for the entire industry, discussed in "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationscatastrophe modeling." the company estimates that the attachment point for the index-based losses and the maximum limit on the reinsurance agreements in the catastrophe bond
program will increase by as much as 70%, reflecting increases in the third-party model's industry estimate of covered losses. the company regularly reviews its catastrophe reinsurance coverage and may
seek additional catastrophe reinsurance coverage, either through general catastrophe
table of contents
reinsurance
or through catastrophe bonds, to provide protection against the higher potential retention of catastrophe losses resulting from the expected increase in the attachment point.
increased
late reporting of weather-related losses by claimants over the last several years, particularly losses from hail damage, has also adversely impacted the company's results of
operations. actions that the company has taken in response, including increased pricing in some areas, changes to terms and conditions and an increased focus on fraud detection, may not be successful.
in
recent years, the company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development, although at lower levels in recent quarters, driven by better
than expected loss experience in all of the company's segments. the lower levels of prior year reserve development in
recent quarters may be in part due to the estimation process incorporating those factors that led to the higher levels of prior year reserve development in previous years. if that trend continues, the
better than expected loss experience may continue at these recent lower levels, or even lower levels. however, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves, loss experience could develop such that the company recognizes higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable
prior year reserve development in future periods. in addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may
result in the company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods.
in
business insurance, the company expects that the anticipated impact of the improving trend in renewal premium changes, partially offset by an expected modest increase in underlying
losses, and weather patterns consistent with the company's expectations will likely result in underlying underwriting margins during 2012 that are higher than in 2011, beginning in the first half of
2012. in financial, professional& international insurance, the company expects that the anticipated impact of lower underlying losses, partially offset by higher employee- and
technology-related costs to enhance operations and support future business growth in international, will likely result in underlying underwriting margins during 2012 that are modestly higher than in
2011, beginning in the first half of 2012. in personal insurance, the company anticipates increased underlying underwriting margins during 2012 as compared with 2011, beginning in the first half of
2012, reflecting the anticipated impact of continued positive renewal premium changes, partially offset by a modest increase in underlying losses, and weather patterns consistent with the company's
expectations. also in personal insurance, the company's direct to consumer initiative, as discussed above, while intended to enhance the company's long-term ability to compete successfully
in a consumer-driven marketplace, is expected to remain unprofitable for a number of years as this book of business grows and matures.
investment portfolio.the company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment
portfolio
and a relatively short average effective duration. the company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. currently, the majority of the company's investments are comprised of a widely
diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid taxable u.s. government, tax-exempt u.s. municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds. the company reduced its
short-term investment holdings from $5.62billion at december31, 2010 to $3.59billion at december31, 2011.
the
company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships, real estate and insurance
joint ventures, mortgage loans, venture capital (through direct ownership and limited partnerships) and trading securities. these investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also
involve varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.
net
investment income is a material contributor to the company's results of operations. long-term interest rates declined in the second half of 2011 and are very low by
historic standards. as a result, the company expects investment returns for its fixed maturity investment
portfolio to be slightly lower during 2012 than in recent periods due to lower reinvestment yields available for maturing long-term
table of contents
fixed
maturity investments. short-term interest rates are expected to remain at or near historically low levels during 2012. given recent unfavorable general economic and investment market
conditions, the company expects investment income from the non-fixed maturity portfolio in 2012 to be lower than in 2011. if general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions
deteriorate in 2012, the company could also experience further reduction in net investment income and/or significant realized investment losses, including impairments. for further discussion of the
company's investment portfolio, see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsinvestment portfolio" in this report.
for a discussion of the risks to our business during or following a financial market disruption and risks to our investment portfolio, see the risk factors entitled "during or following a period of
financial market disruption or economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected" and "our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized
losses" included in "risk factors" in parti, item1a of this report.
capital position.the company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value,
expects to
continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders. in recent years, the company has returned capital to its shareholders, comprising dividends to common
shareholders and common share repurchases, in amounts that have exceeded its operating income. in 2012, the company expects that the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share
repurchases will likely not exceed operating income. in addition, actual amounts of common share repurchases will also depend on a variety of additional factors, including corporate and regulatory
requirements, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company's existing ratings from independent rating agencies, share price, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, strategic
initiatives and other market conditions. for information regarding the company's common share repurchases in 2011, see "liquidity and capital resourcesshare repurchases" in this report.
the
company had a net after-tax unrealized investment gain of $2.77billion in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2011. while the company
does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders' equity,
and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects.
many
of the statements in this "outlook" section are forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the company's
control. actual
results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. further, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and the company
undertakes no obligation to update them. see "forward looking statements." for a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the company's results of operations or
financial position, see "item1arisk factors" and "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationscritical accounting estimates" in this report.
liquidity and capital resources
liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash
requirements of its business operations. the liquidity requirements of the company's business have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, asset maturities and income received on
investments. cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses, and in recent years, for common share repurchases. the timing
and amount of catastrophe claims are inherently unpredictable. such claims increase liquidity requirements. the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and
reinsurance coverage disputes. additionally, the variability of asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation,
table of contents
may
also result in increased liquidity requirements. it is the opinion of the company's management that the company's future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the above sources.
at
december31, 2011, total cash and short-term invested assets aggregating $2.39billion and having a weighted average maturity of 74days were held in
the united states by the holding company. these assets are sufficient to meet the holding company's current liquidity requirements and are more than two times the company's minimum target level. these
liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt service and contributions to its qualified pension plan from time to time.
the
holding company is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. u.s. income taxes have not been recognized on
$649million of the company's foreign operations' undistributed earnings as of december31, 2011, as such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations.
furthermore, taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits against the u.s. tax on dividend distributions if
such earnings were to be distributed to the holding company. the amount of undistributed earnings from foreign operations and related taxes on those undistributed earnings were not material to the
company's financial position or liquidity at december31, 2011.
the
company has a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which permits it to issue securities from time to time. the company also has a
$1.0billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in 2013. this line of credit also supports the company's $800million commercial paper
program, of which $100million was outstanding at december31, 2011. the company is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs.
the
company currently utilizes uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately $432million to provide much of the capital needed
to support its obligations at lloyd's. if uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the company can collateralize these letters of credit or
may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at lloyd's, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand.
operating activities
net cash flows provided by operating activities were $2.17billion, $3.05billion and $4.23billion in 2011, 2010
and 2009, respectively. cash flows in 2011 reflected an increase in losses paid related to catastrophes and ongoing business (including the impact of increased loss costs), a higher level of
contributions to the company's qualified domestic pension plan and lower receipts related to net investment income as compared with 2010. these factors were partially offset by a higher level of
collected premiums, a lower level of paid operating expenses and a lower level of paid losses related to asbestos claims and operations in runoff. cash flows in 2010 reflected a higher level of claims
and claim adjustment expense payments due to the impact of loss cost trends and a higher level of catastrophe loss payments, as well as a lower level of reinsurance recoveries, partially offset by
declines in the amount of contributions to the company's qualified domestic pension plan and lower claims and claim adjustment expense payments related to operations in runoff as compared with 2009.
in the years ended december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the company contributed $185million, $35million and $260million, respectively, to its qualified domestic pension
plan.
investing activities
net cash flows provided by investing activities were $1.15billion and $2.11billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively,
compared with net cash flows used in investing activities of
$899million in 2009. the company's consolidated total investments at december31, 2011 decreased by $21million from year-end 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of
the company's common share repurchases of $2.90billion under its share repurchase authorization and shareholder dividends of $665million, largely
table of contents
offset
by operating cash flows of $2.17billion and a $1.57billion increase in net pretax unrealized appreciation of investments.
on
june17, 2011, the company acquired 43% of the common stock of j. malucelli participaes em seguros e resseguros s.a, a brazilian company
("jmalucelli"). jmalucelli is currently the market leader in surety in brazil based on market share. the company's investment was approximately $410million in u.s. dollars, which was funded
with cash provided internally from an operating subsidiary of the company. the company has an option to increase its interest in jmalucelli up to 49.9% within 18months from the date of the
consummation of the transaction.
the
primary goals of the company's assetliability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in
projected liability cash flows. generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company's
insurance reserves. although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the expected present value of
the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the company's ability to fund claim payments
without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.
financing activities
net cash flows used in financing activities were $3.31billion, $5.22billion and $3.44billion in 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. the totals in each year reflected common share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and the repayment of debt, partially offset by the proceeds from employee stock option
exercises and, in 2010 and 2009, the issuance of debt.
debt transactions.
2011.on june1, 2011, the company repaid the remaining $9million principal balance on its 7.22% real estate non-recourse
debt.
2010.on november1, 2010, the company issued $500million aggregate principal amount 3.90% senior notes that will mature on
november1, 2020, and $750million aggregate principal amount 5.35% senior notes that will mature on november1, 2040. the net proceeds of these issuances, after original issuance
discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, were approximately $496million and $738million, respectively. interest on the senior notes is
payable semi-annually in arrears on november1 and may1 of each year. the senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the company's
option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a)100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or (b)the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis
(assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current treasury rate (as defined) plus 15 basis points for the 2020 senior notes and 20 basis points
for the 2040 notes.
prior
to november 2010, the company was subject to a replacement capital covenant that it had granted to the holders of its 6.75% senior notes due june20, 2036 (the senior
notes). the replacement capital covenant restricted the company's ability to repurchase its $1.00billion in outstanding 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated
debentures due march15, 2067 (the debentures). in november 2010, the company paid approximately $4million to holders of the senior notes to terminate the replacement capital covenant.
following the termination, the company purchased approximately $885million aggregate principal amount of the debentures. a $60million pretax loss was recognized in 2010 related to
these transactions.
table of contents
on september16, 2010, the company repaid the remaining $4million principal balance on its 7.81% private placement senior notes. on
august23, 2010, the company's $21million, 7.415% medium-term notes matured and were fully paid. on april15, 2010, the company's $250million, 8.125% senior
notes matured and were fully paid. all of these debt payments were made from internally-generated funds.
2009.on june2, 2009, the company issued $500million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% senior notes that will mature on
june2, 2019. the net proceeds of the issuance, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, were approximately
$494million. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on june2 and december2 of each year. the senior notes are redeemable in whole at any
time or in part from time to time, at the company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a)100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or (b)the sum
of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date
of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current treasury rate (as defined) plus 35 basis
points.
on
march3, 2009, the company's zero coupon convertible notes with an effective yield of 4.17% and a remaining principal balance of $141million matured and were fully
paid.
the
amounts of debt obligations, other than commercial paper, that becomes due in 2012 and 2013 are $250million and $500million, respectively. in 2014, no debt
obligations become due.
dividends.dividends paid to shareholders were $665million, $673million and $693million in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.
on january24, 2012, the company's board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share, payable march30, 2012 to shareholders of record on march9, 2012.
the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the company's common stock will be at the discretion of the company's board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the
company's financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems
relevant. dividends will be paid by the company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the company.
share repurchases.the company's board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be
made from time
to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of rule10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, in private transactions
or otherwise. the authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the
company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal
requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions), market conditions and other factors. the following table summarizes repurchase activity in

from
the inception of the first authorization in may 2006 through december31, 2011, the company repurchased a cumulative total of 340.0million shares for a total cost of
$17.39billion, or an average of $51.16 per share.
in
2011, 2010 and 2009, the company acquired 1.4million, 1.3million and 1.5million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock
primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options.
conversion of preferred stock to common stock.in may 2011, the company's board of directors authorized the redemption of the company's
preferred
stock held by the travelers 401(k) savings plan (the savings plan) and gave notice of that redemption to the appropriate fiduciaries of the savings plan. following a fiduciary review, the savings plan
exercised its right to convert each preferred share into eight shares of the company's common stock. as a result, all preferred shares outstanding on june7, 2011 (190,083shares) were
converted into a total of 1.52million shares of the company's common stock.
capital resources
capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise

the
debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments is calculated by dividing (a)debt by (b)total capitalization
excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes. net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors
and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. accordingly, in the opinion of the company's management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis
provides another useful metric for investors to understand the company's financial leverage position. the company's debt-to-total capital ratio of 23.4% at december31,
2011 calculated on this basis was within the company's target range.
line of credit agreement.the company is party to a three-year, $1.0billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of
financial institutions that expires in june 2013. pursuant to the credit agreement covenants, the company must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth (generally defined as shareholders' equity plus
certain trust preferred and mandatorily convertible securities, reduced for goodwill and other intangible assets) of $14.35billion. the company must also maintain a ratio of total debt to the
sum of total debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than 0.40 to 1.00. in addition, the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of
default, including with respect to a change in control, which is defined to include the acquisition of 35% or more of the company's voting stock and certain changes in the composition of the company's
board of directors. at december31, 2011, the company was in compliance with these covenants. generally, the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from libor plus 100 basis points
to libor plus 175 basis points depending on the company's credit ratings. at december31, 2011, that cost would have been libor plus 125 basis points had there been any amounts outstanding
under the credit agreement. this line of credit also supports the company's commercial paper program.
shelf registration.in december 2011, the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration
statement for the
potential offering and sale of securities to replace the
company's previous registration statement that had expired in the normal course of business. the company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at
the time of offering. during 2010, the company issued securities with a principal amount of $1.25billion under the prior shelf registration statement.
share repurchase authorization.at december31, 2011, the company had $3.61billion of capacity remaining under its share
repurchase
authorization approved by the board of directors.
contractual obligations
the following table summarizes, as of december31, 2011, the company's future payments under contractual obligations and
estimated claims and claim-related payments. the table excludes short-term obligations and includes only liabilities at december31, 2011 that are expected to be settled in cash.
the
table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related payments. the amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates,
generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques, at a given accounting date. these estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on
the company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other
factors. variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends
and legislative changes. many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the
policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. the future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount (including severity
considerations) and timing. amount and timing

are
frequently estimated separately. an estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim-related payments is generally reliable only in the aggregate with some
unavoidable estimation uncertainty.

the
company has entered into reinsurance agreements to protect itself from potential losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept as
described in note5 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
in
order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must
transfer amount and timing risk. since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by
the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured
contracts. the presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance (see
below). the assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities.
reinsurance
agreements that do not transfer both amount and timing risk are accounted for as deposits and included in "reinsurance contracts
accounted for as deposits" in the table above.

the
amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been
adjusted to reflect the time value of money. accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the company's balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and
the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet. (see note1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.)
(8)workers'
compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under
such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. "claims from large deductible
table of contents
policies"
represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. the liability and the related
deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as "contractholder payables" and "contractholder receivables," respectively. most deductibles for such policies
are paid directly from the policyholder's escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder. the payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within "claims and claim
adjustment expenses" in the above table. because the timing of the collection of the deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant
(contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table.

(9)the
amounts in "loss-based assessments" relate to estimated future payments of second-injury fund assessments which would result from payment of
current claim liabilities. second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition. for loss-based assessments, the cost is
shared by the insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on losses. amounts relating to second-injury fund
assessments are included in "other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet.
(10)the
amounts in "reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits" represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted
for as deposits. amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in "other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet. the amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and
have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the company's balance sheet to the extent that deposit values in the balance sheet have been
discounted using deposit accounting.
(11)the
amounts in "payout from ceded funds withheld" represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance
arrangements whereby the company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held.
(12)the
company's current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are $356million. offsetting these liabilities
are deferred tax assets of $324million associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized.
the
above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event
of default by the company issuing the annuity. the company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements. in addition, the company is not currently
subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan. accordingly, future contributions are not included in the foregoing table.
dividend availability
the company's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the state of connecticut. the insurance holding company laws of
connecticut applicable to the company's subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other
distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer's capital and surplus as of the preceding december31, or the insurer's net income for the
twelve-month period ending the preceding december31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. this declaration or payment is further
limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.
table of contents
the insurance holding company laws of other states in which the company's subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances
somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. a maximum of $1.96billion is available by the end of 2012 for such dividends without prior approval of the connecticut
insurance department. the company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2012 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2012, which could result in certain
dividends being subject to approval by the connecticut insurance department. the holding company received $2.33billion of dividends from its domestic insurance subsidiaries in 2011.
pension and other postretirement benefit plans
the company sponsors a qualified non-contributory pension plan (the qualified plan), which covers substantially all
employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula. in addition, the company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain highly compensated employees
and also sponsors a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for certain retirees.
the
qualified plan is subject to regulations under the employee retirement income act of 1974 as amended (erisa), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and requires
such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the pension benefit guaranty corporation(pbgc). the company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the qualified plan for
2012 and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2013. the company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding
requirements. the company made discretionary contributions to the qualified plan of $185million, $35million, and $260million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. in
determining future contributions, the company considers the performance of the plan's investment portfolio, the effects of interest rates on the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the
company's other capital requirements. the company has not determined whether or not additional discretionary funding will be made in the current year or beyond. however, the company currently
believes, subject to actual plan performance and funded status at the time, that it may make discretionary pension contributions of approximately $75 million to $100 million annually over the next few
years.
the
qualified plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return. the company's overall strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for
long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. the current target allocations for
plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. for 2012, the company plans to apply an expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.50%, down from 8.00% in 2011. the reduction reflects the company's current expectations of long-term returns on the plan's invested
assets, taking into account the current low level of long-term interest rates as well as the federal reserve's commentary in january 2012 regarding expected interest rate levels through
2014, and projecting a return to more normal levels of long-term interest rates in the future.
for
further discussion of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see note13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
risk-based capital
the naic adopted rbc requirements for property casualty companies to be used as minimum capital requirements by the naic and states to
identify companies that merit further regulatory action. the formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital above the rbc
requirements. therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. at december31, 2011, all of the company's insurance subsidiaries had
adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any company or regulatory action.
table of contents
off-balance sheet arrangements
the company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to certain investments, third-party loans related to
certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications, including those related to the sale of business entities. see
note15 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements. the company does not expect these arrangements to have a material effect on the company's financial position, changes in
financial position, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
critical accounting estimates
the company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and
related reinsurance recoverables, investment valuation and impairments and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments.

impact from certain reclassifications made to 2010 amounts to conform to 2011 presentation.
the
$187million decrease in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since december31, 2010 primarily reflected the impact of net favorable prior year reserve
development and payments related to operations in runoff, including asbestos and environmental claims, partially offset by the significant catastrophe losses incurred in 2011 and growth in business
volume.
asbestos
and environmental reserves are included in the general liability, commercial multi-peril and international and other lines in the foregoing summary table. asbestos and
environmental reserves are discussed separately; see "asbestos claims and litigation", "environmental claims and litigation" and "uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental
reserves."
claims
and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims
that have been incurred but not yet reported (ibnr). claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates,
generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. these estimates are
table of contents
expectations
of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review
of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. in establishing gross claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves, the company also considers salvage and subrogation. estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in "reinsurance recoverables" as an asset on the company's
consolidated balance sheet. the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company.
the
process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables can be affected by both
internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative
changes, among others. the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. estimation difficulties also differ significantly by
product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time
between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual
experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. the company continually refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims
are reported and settled. the company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established. due to the
inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses
may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially
different than the amount currently recordedfavorable or unfavorable.
because
establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves may change. the company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.
there
are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes and other
catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and
regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding
versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold
damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. the timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the
company in estimating reserves for that reporting period. the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.
a
portion of the company's claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $3.13billion at december31, 2011) are for asbestos and environmental claims and related
litigation. while the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded theories of
liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the company's management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding
these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the
table of contents
company's
future operating results. see the preceding discussion of "asbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation."
general discussion
the process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim
data. data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated
by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line. such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and
when appropriate. the process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information.
multiple
estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and
disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. the relative
strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change
with each evaluation. the estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated.
in
most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. this will result in a range of reasonable
estimates for any particular claim liability. the company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable, given
subsequent information. reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. these reviews may substantiate the validity of
management's recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate.
the
exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for
an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. as a result, the company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. in
addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process.
property-casualty
insurance policies are either written on a claims-made or on an occurrence basis. claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements
in individual policies, claims reported during the policy period. policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even
if the insured reports the loss many years later.
most
general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. these policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years
following the policy issuance. the occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction
general liability, including construction defect. occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation and
judicial interpretations and societal litigation dynamics, among others.
a
basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors
discussed below. to the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if
available and when appropriate, external data. such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the
table of contents
particular
claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process.
informed
judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. this includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. in
addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. therefore, management may have to
consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. it is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger,
consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult.
the
variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the
reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line.
product
lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final
resolution of those claims. short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. the longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to
estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty.
a
major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. the reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes
estimating ibnr inherently more uncertain. in addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of ibnr to the total claim liability for the product line. writing new products with
material reporting lags can result in adding several years' worth of ibnr claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with
pricing and reserving such products. the most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims.
for
some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. these lines are generally referred to as being "low frequency/high severity," while lines without
this "large claim" sensitivity are referred to as "high frequency/low severity." estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number
of potentially large claims. as a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. in contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is
relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable.
claim
complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and
claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater
estimation uncertainty.
actuaries
have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. the human element in the application of actuarial
judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional
experiences and areas of focus. hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other.
lastly,
significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. events such as mergers increase the
inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization.
table of contents
risk factors
the major causes of material uncertainty ("risk factors") generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately
analyzed component of the product line. in a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. for example, a method may explicitly
assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. actual results will
likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently.
some
risk factors will affect more than one product line. examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions,
court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line.
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components.
the
effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. for example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the
risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors.
the
evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. for example, the timing of claims payments in one
geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region.
while
some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more
evolutionary. evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. the final
impact is not known until all steps have occurred.
sudden
changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. evolutionary changes
generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable.
actuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
the principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the company's actuaries are the paid development method, the case incurred
development method, the bornhuetter-ferguson (bf) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method. the bf method is usually utilized for more recent accident
periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible. these are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods. (see
glossary for an explanation of these methods).
while
these are the principal methods utilized throughout the company, actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods
developed within the casualty actuarial profession. the company's actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of
new techniques that might improve current and future estimates.
some
components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component. in such cases, the
company's actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims. the reserves excluding such large
table of contents
claims
are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described above. the reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods, such
as:
estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods,
adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available.
utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate
accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates. (this monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates.)
utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the
estimated ultimate small claims from conventional analysis.
ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental).
the
results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including paid-to-incurred loss ratios, implied
incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios and non-zero claim severity trends. an actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss
development to expected development based on the prior review. additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods.
the
methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management's existing estimate for prior accident periods. for the initial estimate of the current accident year, the
available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. hence, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method, which uses the
earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio. the projected loss ratio is determined through an analysis of prior periods' experience, using loss trend, rate level
differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years. the exact number of prior accident years utilized
varies by product line component, based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate.
management's estimates
at least once per quarter, certain company management meets with its actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense
reserve analyses. based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. in doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided
represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. for example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic
region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. the resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a
change in ultimate claim liability.
such
an assessment requires considerable judgment. it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. even if a change
is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. the overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several
months to perform. this is because the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. it may also
include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. as a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected
in the company's estimated claim liabilities. the final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new
actionable information.
the
audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for providing oversight of reserving propriety, and annually reviews the process by which the company establishes reserves.
table of contents
discussion of product lines
the following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. there are many additional risk factors
that may impact ultimate claim costs. each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves.
for example, in workers' compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs.
thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation.
in
order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over
a one-year period are provided for the u.s. product lines. this information is provided for both the company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most
recent publicly available data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. these changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual
statement data found in schedulep of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided
by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense. data presented for the company includes history for the entire
travelers group (u.s. companies only), whether or not the individual subsidiaries were originally part of spc or tpc. this treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by
state regulatory authorities for schedulep. comparable data for non-u.s. companies is not available.
general liability
general liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims
from a given accident year. the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as
self-insured retentions. there are numerous
components underlying the general liability product line. some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within 5 to 7years),
while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g.,a reporting lag of a decade or more for "construction defect" claims).
while
the majority of general liability coverages are written on an "occurrence" basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional
liability) are typically insured on a "claims-made" basis.
general
liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property
damage. bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder's legal obligation arising from non-intentional
acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. in some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future
medical treatment costs. property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant's private property arising from the policyholder's legal obligation for non-intentional
acts. in most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter. in addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. these exposures include
asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect, medical malpractice and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis. these unique categories often require a very
high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods.
table of contents
defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid
claims. for some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim. such "defense within
the limits" policies are most common for "claims-made" products. when defense costs are outside of the limits, amounts paid for defense costs do not erode the policy limits.
this
line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the united states (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). major contributors to
this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e.,the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties
involved in the underlying tort action, whether the "event" triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the
individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e.,coverage dispute potential), and the
potential for mass claim actions. claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. this is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have
ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars
involved and the underlying settlement complexity). claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e.,the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market
and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure).
the
amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. the components in this product line with the longest latency,
longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity
issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect, medical malpractice and other mass tort actions. many components of general liability are not
subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. in general, policies providing coverage with shorter
reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential
hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics.
in
addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development and s-curve methods for
the construction defect components of this product line. the construction defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for ibnr claim counts.
for components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the company relies more heavily on the bf method than on the paid and case incurred
development methods.

unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability
(excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied
from -8% to 14% (averaging 1%) for the company and from -5% to 7% (averaging 0%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven
by, and are based on, observed events during the year. because the high end of the company's range of historical adverse development comes from certain businesses that the company
has since exited, the company believes that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
general liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 25% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, was -8% for 2011, -5% for 2010 and
-5% for 2009. the 2011 change was concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2005-2008 and reflected what the company believes are more favorable legal and judicial
environments than what the company previously expected. the 2010 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior and reflected what the company believes are
more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected. the 2009 change was driven by several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, as well as
enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives.
property
property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability
coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). it is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line,
except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. the claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the
insurer. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims.
table of contents
property
reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. examples of common risk factors, or
perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:
property
risk factors
physical concentration of policyholders
availability and cost of local contractors
for the more severe catastrophic events, "demand surge" inflation, which refers to significant short-term
increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services
local building codes
amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims)
frequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed
court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding)
lags in reporting claims (e.g.,winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to
roofs and/or equipment on roofs)
court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations
property
book of business risk factors
policy provisions mix (e.g.,deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)
changes in underwriting standards
unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1%
increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -34% to 26% (averaging -13%)
for the company, and from -14% to 7% (averaging -7%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on,
observed events during the year. because the high end of the company's range of historical adverse development comes from certain businesses that the company has since exited, the company believes
that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. property reserves represent
approximately 3% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
since
property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. this is due to the fact that the
majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to
property because of weather related events which, notwithstanding 2010 and 2011 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the
following year. reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. the reserve estimates for this
product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for unprecedented significant catastrophes such as the events of september11, 2001
and hurricane katrina.
table of contents
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -5% for 2011, -25% for 2010 and -9% for 2009. the 2011 change primarily reflected
better than expected development in the 2008 and 2009 accident years for certain large national property and ocean marine exposures. the 2010 change primarily occurred in the 2008 and 2009 accident
years as a result of better than expected loss development in industry-focused underwriting and target risk underwriting. the 2009 change was primarily driven by better than expected loss development
in the 2007 and 2008 accident years for certain large national property and inland marine exposures. in addition, the 2005 accident year experience improved due to the litigation environment relating
to, and ongoing claim settlements for, hurricane katrina.
commercial multi-peril
commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore,
includes both short and long tail coverages. for property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability
coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims.
the
reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. the reserving
risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. commercial multi-peril is generally sold to smaller-sized
accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and property includes larger customers.
see
"property risk factors" and "general liability risk factors," discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril.
unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial
multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each
future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -16% to 3% (averaging -5%)
for the company, and from -5% to 6% (averaging 0%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events
during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. commercial
multi-peril reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 7% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
as
discussed above, this line combines general liability and property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 3% for 2011, 0% for 2010 and -8% for 2009. the 2011 change reflected unfavorable loss development driven by
late reporting of hail claims incurred in 2010. the 2009 change was attributable to several factors, including improved legal and judicial environments, and enhanced risk control, underwriting and
claim process initiatives. also contributing to the change was improvement in the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, hurricane katrina.
commercial automobile
the commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail
coverages. the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. the payments that take
table of contents
longer
to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. in general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high
frequency, low to moderate severity. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.
commercial
automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. these last two
components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented.
the
company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. this is supplemented with detailed custom
analyses where needed.
examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:
bodily
injury and property damage liability risk factors
trends in jury awards
changes in the underlying court system
changes in case law
litigation trends
frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits
change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents
changes in auto safety technology

unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial
automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
table of contents
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -10% to 5% (averaging -3%)
for the company, and from -3% to 5% (averaging -1%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on,
observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product
line. commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 5% for 2011, -1% for 2010 and -6% for 2009. the 2011 change reflected worse than expected
severity for the 2009 and 2010 accident years. the 2009 change was a result of better than expected loss development, primarily for recent accident years, which was attributable to several factors,
including improved legal and judicial environments, and enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives.
workers' compensation
workers' compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims
from a given accident year. while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course
of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. in addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker's life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going
medical care. despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency
with moderate severity. the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker's injury. overall,
the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk.
workers'
compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses.
examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers' compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:
indemnity
risk factors
time required to recover from the injury
degree of available transitional jobs
degree of legal involvement
changes in the interpretations and processes of the workers' compensation commissions' oversight of claims(1)
future wage inflation for states that index benefits
changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds
medical
risk factors
changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules ("inflation")
(1)these
are administrative bodies that evaluate whether or not a given claim for workers' compensation benefits is valid. their duties include the
determination of whether a given injury arose out of the scope of employment or the determination of the degree of injury where disputes exist.

historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -1% to 2% (averaging 0%) for the company,
and from -1% to 4% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the
company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. workers' compensation reserves
represent approximately 33% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 0% in 2011, -1% in 2010 and -1% for 2009.
fidelity and surety
fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. it takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle fidelity
claims. the volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured's business operations, amount of policy limit and
attachment point of coverage. the uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. the high
frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates whereas, the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a
wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity policies.
table of contents
surety
has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can
result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured. (large construction projects can take many years to complete.)
the frequency of losses in surety generally correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured contractor to fulfill its contractual obligations. the
company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through disciplined risk selection and adherence to underwriting standards. the volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of
business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract
funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of an insured's assets. certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. these can
include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. other claim factors affecting reserve variability of
surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g.,salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured.

unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves

reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -11% to 138% (averaging 14%) for the
company, and from -13% to 24% (averaging 4%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during
the year. because the high end of the company's range was due to acquired business in 2004, the company believes that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible
one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 3% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
in
general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -11% for 2011, -6% for 2010 and -7% for 2009. the 2011 change primarily reflected
better than expected development for accident years 2008 and prior for the contract surety business. the 2010 change was driven by better than expected loss development due to lower than expected
claim activity and loss severity, primarily for the contract surety business in this product line for the 2008 and prior accident years. the 2009 change was a result of better than expected loss
development for the contract surety business within this product line, primarily driven by favorable settlements on large claims from older accident years.
personal automobile
personal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical
damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. reporting lags are
relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. it is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to
moderate severity product line. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.
personal
automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and
comprehensive claims. these last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented.

the company, and from -4% to 0% (averaging -2%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed
events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
personal automobile reserves represent approximately 5% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 3% for 2011, 0% for 2010 and 0% for 2009. the 2011 change reflected worse than expected severity for the
2007-2010 accident years.
homeowners and personal lines other
homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the
claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. claims on property coverage are typically reported
soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. the resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist.
the
liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags. in
addition, reserves related to umbrella coverages have greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future.
table of contents
overall,
the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity.
homeowners
reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments.

historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business, which for statutory reporting purposes is included
with the general liability line of business) over the last nine years has varied from -31% to 3% (averaging -12%) for the
table of contents
company,
and from -8% to 11% (averaging -3%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed
events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent approximately 3% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
this
line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. while property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year
change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year,
which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which, notwithstanding 2010 and 2011
experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take
even longer to resolve.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business) was -7% for 2011, 2% for 2010 and -14% for 2009. the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line including the umbrella line of business was -11% for 2011, -4% for 2010 and -12% for 2009. the 2011
change reflected better than expected loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in the first half of 2010, as well as better than expected loss development in the
2006-2010 accident years for the umbrella line of business. the 2010 change reflected favorable loss development in the 2008 and prior accident years, primarily for the
umbrella line of business, partially offset by unfavorable loss development in the 2009 accident year for the homeowners' line of business that was driven by higher than anticipated
late-reported claims related to storms in 2009. the 2009 change primarily reflected favorable loss development related to hurricanes ike and katrina, as well as the 2007 california
wildfires.
international and other
international and other includes products written by international and other products not discussed above. the principal component of
"other" claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non-u.s. exposures, and is runoff business.
international
and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. the common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the
individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the u.s. statutory reporting framework.
due
to changes in the business mix for this line over time, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved,
e.g.,the republic of ireland and the united kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g.,u.s. excess liabilities
reinsured through the london market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the
distribution system (e.g.,underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g.,insured and insurer located in different countries). in
particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool
members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes.
international
and other reserves are generally analyzed by program/pool, country and general coverage category (e.g.,u.s. liabilityexcess of loss reinsurance, or
general liabilitymunicipalitiesby country). the business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage/jurisdiction. where the underlying
insured hazard is outside the united states, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the general liability and property discussion
table of contents
above,
provided that reserves relating to insured hazards outside the united states are analyzed taking into account differences in the legal environment and differences in terms and conditions,
including, for example and where applicable, that in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy limits on certain
liability coverages. where the underlying hazard is within the u.s., the coverage involved is typically that of general liability and property, but on an excess or
excess-of-loss reinsurance basis. excess exposure requires the insured to "prove" not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the
excess policy's attachment point.
examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required international and other reserves (beyond those included in the general
discussion section) include:
international
and other risk factors
changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers
changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision
new theories of liability
trends in jury awards
changes in the propensity to sue
changes in statutes of limitations
changes in the underlying court system
distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues
changes in tort law
changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data)
international
and other book of business risk factors
changes in policy provisions (e.g.,deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, "claims-made"
language)
changes in underwriting standards
product mix (e.g.,size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix)
unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for international and
other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each
future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. international and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent
approximately 8% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
international
and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff. comparative historical information is not available for international product
lines as insurers domiciled outside of the u.s. do not fileu.s. statutory reports. comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible
one-year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business. accordingly, the company has not included comparative analyses for international and other.

subsidiary of old mutual u.s. life holdings,inc. prior to being sold by its u.k. parent company to harbinger groupinc. and being renamed.
the
$700million decline in net reinsurance recoverables since december31, 2010 reflected cash collections and the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development.
amounts
recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers
under voluntary
reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the company becomes involved in coverage disputes
with its reinsurers. some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the company's rights and obligations under the various
reinsurance agreements. the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.
the
reinsurance agreements that the company entered into as part of its catastrophe bond programs are dual trigger contracts and meet the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance
in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. the company's catastrophe bond programs are described in more detail in
"item1businesscatastrophe reinsurance."
the
company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. the allowance is based upon the company's ongoing review of
amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. accordingly, the establishment of
reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. from time to time, as a result of the
long-tailed nature of the underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, the company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts. changes in estimated
reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges.
recoverables
attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the
company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities. recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate
primarily to workers' compensation service business. these recoverables are supported by the participating
table of contents
insurance
companies' obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company's voluntary market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. in the event a member of a
mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool's or association's obligations, the other members' share of such obligation increases proportionally.
on
august20, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in new york state court captioned united states fidelity& guaranty company v. american
re-insurance company, et al., the trial court granted summary judgment for united states fidelity and guaranty company (usf&g), a subsidiary of the company, and on
october25, 2010, entered judgment against american re-insurance company, a subsidiary of munich re (american re) and three other reinsurers, awarding usf&g
$251million plus pre-judgment interest in the amount of $169million. the judgment, including the award of interest, was appealed to the new york supreme court, appellate
division, first department. on january24, 2012, the appellate division affirmed the judgment, which, as of that date, totaled $467million, comprising the judgment of
$251million and interest of $216million (including post-judgment interest). post-judgment interest continues to accrue (without compounding) at the rate of 9% until the
judgment is paid. on january30, 2012, the reinsurers filed a motion with the appellate division seeking permission to appeal its decision to the new york court of appeals. whether the
appellate division grants permission to appeal is within its discretion. the $251million awarded by the court represents the amount owed to usf&g under the terms of the disputed reinsurance
agreements and is reported as part of reinsurance recoverables in the company's consolidated balance sheet. the interest awarded by the court, including post-judgment interest, is treated
for accounting purposes as a gain contingency in accordance with fasb topic 450, contingencies, and accordingly has not been recognized in the company's
consolidated financial statements.
investment valuation and impairments
fair value measurements
the company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair
value accounting guidance. the framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and requires that observable inputs be used in the
valuations when available. the disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. in
determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
that reflect the company's significant market assumptions. the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:
level1unadjusted
quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability
to access.
level2quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g.,interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss
severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.
level3valuations
based on models where significant inputs are not observable. the unobservable inputs reflect the company's
own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use.
valuation of investments reported at fair value in financial statements
the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction
between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e.,not in a
table of contents
forced
transaction. the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g.,a forced
transaction. additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair
value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.
for
investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in
level1 of the hierarchy. the company receives the quoted market prices from a third party, nationally recognized pricing service (pricing service). when quoted market prices are unavailable,
the company utilizes a pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value, which is mainly used for its fixed maturity investments. the fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are
included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. if quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the company produces an estimate of fair value
based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as level2 or level3. the company
bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction.
fixed maturities
the company utilizes a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities. the pricing
service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. since fixed maturities other than u.s. treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily
basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which include available relevant market information, benchmark
curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. additionally, the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.
the
pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. the market inputs utilized
in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark
securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. the extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions. depending on the security,
the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. for some securities, additional inputs may be necessary.
the
pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. if
the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to
make assumptions for market-based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions.
the
fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed
maturities, other than u.s. treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. the estimated fair value of u.s. treasury
securities is included in the amount disclosed in level1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.
the
company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the company's knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained
are representative of the prices in the market. in addition, the company has periodic discussions with the
table of contents
pricing
service to discuss any changes in their process and reactions to overall markets. the company produces a report monthly that lists all price changes from the previous month in excess of 10%.
the company reviews the report and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value. in addition, the company has implemented various other processes including randomly
selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing reports that contain securities whose valuation did not change from
their previous valuation (stale price review). the company also uses an additional independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service's valuation of the company's fixed maturity
portfolio. these processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the pricing service.
the
company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an internal matrix that
is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. the underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the u.s. treasury curve are
the bofa merrill lynch u.s. corporate index and the bofa merrill lynch high yield bb rated index. the company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in level2, since all
significant inputs are market observable.
while
the vast majority of the company's municipal bonds are included in level2, the company holds a small number of municipal bonds which are not valued by the pricing service
and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. due to the limited amount of observable market
information, the company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in level3. additionally, the company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have
characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. for these fixed maturities, the company obtains a quote from a broker (typically a market maker). due to the disclaimers on the quotes
that indicate that the price is indicative only, the company includes these fair value estimates in level3.
non-fixed maturities and other investments not reported at fair value
see note4 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the determination of fair value of
non-fixed maturities and valuation of investments not reported at fair value in the financial statements.
investment impairments
the company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary
impairments. some of the factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1)for fixed maturity investments, whether the company intends to
sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2)for non-fixed
maturity investments, the company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3)the likelihood of
the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities (i.e.,whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4)the length of time and extent to
which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5)the financial condition, near-term and
long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices.
reporting of other-than-temporary impairments
for fixed maturity investments that the company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company would
not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value,
table of contents
the
company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains (losses). the
impairment related to all other factors is reported in accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources.
for
non-fixed maturity investments and for fixed maturity investments the company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company will be required to
sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses).
upon
recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the
other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains (losses). the new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however,
for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the
investment.
due
to the subjective nature of the company's analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the company
could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer. additionally, it is possible that the issuer's actual ability to
meet contractual obligations may be different than what the company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods.

future application of accounting standards
see note1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards
updates.
the
company is currently required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), as promulgated by the financial accounting
standards board (fasb). during the last several years, the securities and exchange commission (sec) has been evaluating whether, when and how international financial reporting standards (ifrs) should
be incorporated into the u.s. financial reporting system. before making a decision, the sec is completing its work plan to evaluate the remaining differences between gaap and ifrs and examine the
variations in the way ifrs was applied by various foreign companies that file financial statements with the sec. in december 2011, the sec staff provided an update of its progress but declined to
provide a timetable for completing its analysis and making a recommendation.
the
international accounting standards board (iasb) and the fasb continue to work on a joint project to develop a global insurance standard that involves methodologies for valuing
insurance contract liabilities that may be significantly different from the methodologies required by current
table of contents
gaap.
the fasb and the iasb have also embarked on a long-term project to converge gaap and ifrs. the company is not able to predict whether it will choose to, or be required to, adopt ifrs
or how the adoption of ifrs (or the convergence of gaap and ifrs, including the joint project for valuing insurance contract liabilities) may impact the company's financial statements in the future.

item7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
market risk
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates (inclusive of credit
spreads), foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related
underlying assets are traded. the following is a discussion of the company's primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of december31, 2011. the company's market risk
sensitive instruments, including derivatives, are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading.
table of contents
the
carrying value of the company's investment portfolio at december31, 2011 and 2010 was $72.70billion and $72.72billion, respectively, of which 88% and 86% was
invested in fixed maturity
securities, respectively. at december31, 2011 and 2010, approximately 6.2% and 6.0%, respectively, of the company's invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies. the company's
exposure to equity price risk is not significant. the company has no direct commodity risk and is not a party to any credit default swaps.
the
primary market risks to the investment portfolio are interest rate risk and credit risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. the portfolio duration relative to
the liabilities' duration is primarily managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions.
at
december31, 2011 and 2010, the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio included collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages and
asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a collective fair value of $351million and $297million, respectively (comprising approximately 0.5% of
the company's total fixed maturity investments at both dates). the disruption in secondary investment markets for mortgage-backed securities provided the company with the opportunity to selectively
acquire additional asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages at discounted prices. the company purchased $128million and $31million of such securities
in 2011 and 2010, respectively. the company defines sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following
characteristics: low fico scores, above-prime interest rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. alternative documentation
securitizations are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the government-sponsored entities' requirements for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entities' guidelines
for documentation, property type, debt and loan-to-value ratios. the average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the company was "baa2" at both
december31, 2011 and 2010.
the
company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2011 included securities issued by numerous states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively
referred to as the municipal bond portfolio), a number of which were enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default. the downgrade of
credit ratings of insurers of these securities in recent years has resulted in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities to the underlying rating of the respective security. of the
insured municipal securities in the company's investment portfolio at december31, 2011, approximately 99% were rated at a3 or above, and approximately 92% were rated at aa3 or above, without
the benefit of insurance. the company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or
liquidity, due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities, as well as the company's ability and intent to hold the securities. the average credit rating of the underlying
issuers of these securities was "aa2" at december31, 2011. the average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was "aa1" at december31, 2011 with and without the
third-party insurance.
on
april2, 2009, municipal securities issued by local governments within the united states were assigned a negative outlook by moody's investors service. notwithstanding the
relatively low historical rates of default on many of these obligations and notwithstanding that the company typically seeks to invest in high-credit-quality securities (including those
with structural protections such as being secured by dedicated or pledged sources of revenue), during or following an economic downturn,
the company's municipal bond portfolio could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue. the severity and duration of state and local
government budget deficits could have an adverse impact on the collectability and valuation of the company's municipal bond portfolio. in addition, some issuers may be unwilling to increase tax rates,
or to reduce spending, to fund interest or principal payments on their municipal bonds, or may be unable to access the municipal bond market to fund such payments. the risk of widespread defaults may
increase if
table of contents
some
issuers voluntarily choose to default, instead of implementing difficult fiscal measures, and the actual or perceived consequences (such as reduced access to capital markets) are less severe than
expected. the risk may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit states, or additional municipalities and political subdivisions, to file for bankruptcy protection or if there are
judicial interpretations that, in a bankruptcy or other proceeding, lessen the value of structural protections.
the
company's tax-exempt fixed maturity investment portfolio was $38.52billion and $39.03billion at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. federal
and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or improve some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the company and result in an adverse or favorable impact on the value
of these holdings.
the
primary market risk for all of the company's debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing. the company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing
opportunities as maturity dates approach. for additional information regarding the company's debt see note8 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements as well as the
"liquidity and capital resources" section of "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
the
company's foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the company's invested assets and insurance reserves denominated in foreign currencies. cash flows from the
company's foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies. the company purchases these investments primarily to fund insurance
reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency, effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure. invested assets denominated in the british pound sterling comprised
approximately 2.4% and 2.5% of the total invested assets at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. invested assets denominated in the canadian dollar comprised approximately 2.4% and 2.3% of
the total invested assets at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. invested assets denominated in other currencies at december31, 2011 and 2010 were not material.
there
were no other significant changes in the company's primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended december31, 2011 compared to the
year ended
december31, 2010. the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based
upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.
sensitivity analysis
sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings, fair values or cash flows of market sensitive
instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period of time. in the company's sensitivity analysis model, a
hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. "near-term" means a period of time going
forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure, especially since this
sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value.
interest rate risk
in this sensitivity analysis model, the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss. the sensitivity analysis model includes
the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading: fixed maturities, non-redeemable preferred stocks, mortgage loans, short-term securities, debt
and derivative financial instruments. the primary market risk to the company's market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk (inclusive of credit spreads). the sensitivity analysis model uses
various
table of contents
basis
point changes in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model.
for
invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk, estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result
from a parallel increase in interest rates. durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put and interest rate reset features. durations on tax-exempt securities are adjusted for
the fact that the yields on
such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the u.s. treasury curve. fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis, including accrued
interest, using holdings as of december31, 2011 and 2010.
for
debt, the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical december31, 2011 and 2010 ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a 100 basis point change,
comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices, and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding.
the
sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately $1.79billion and $2.00billion based on a
100 basis point increase in interest rates at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
the
loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from
emerging interest rate trends. in addition, the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company's financial instruments.
foreign currency exchange rate risk
the company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments. a
hypothetical 10% reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings. the company's analysis indicates that a
hypothetical 10% reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $452million and $434million at
december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the travelers companies, inc. and subsidiaries
as of december31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december31, 2011, in
conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
as
discussed in note1 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed its method of accounting for other-than-temporary impairments of debt
securities as of april1, 2009 due to the adoption of new fasb guidance.
we
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the travelers companies, inc. and subsidiaries' internal control
over financial reporting as of december31, 2011, based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by

the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries         notes to consolidated financial statements
1. summary of significant accounting policies
basis of presentation
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the travelers companies,inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the
company). the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
claims and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. certain reclassifications have been made to the 2010 and 2009 financial statements to conform to the
2011 presentation. all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
adoption of accounting standards updates
creditors' evaluation of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring
in april 2011, the fasb issued updated guidance to clarify whether a modification or restructuring of a receivable is considered a
troubled debt restructuring, i.e.,whether the creditor has granted a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. a modification or restructuring that is
considered a troubled debt restructuring will result in the creditor having to account for the receivable as being impaired and will also result in additional disclosure of the creditors' troubled
debt restructuring activities. the provisions of the guidance were effective for the quarter ended september30, 2011 on a retrospective basis to the beginning of the year. the adoption of this
guidance did not have any effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
other-than-temporary impairments
in april 2009, the fasb issued updated guidance, which provides clarification that an other-than-temporary
impairment is recognized when an entity has the intent to sell a debt security or when it is more likely than not that an entity will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated
recovery in value.
additionally,
the guidance changes the presentation and amount of other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in the income statement for instances in which
the company does not intend to sell a debt security, or it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell a debt security prior to the anticipated recovery of its remaining cost
basis. the company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains (losses).
the impairment related to all other factors is reported in "accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources."
in
addition to the changes in measurement and presentation, the disclosures related to other-than-temporary impairments relating to debt securities are expanded,
and all such disclosures are required to be included in both interim and annual periods.
the
guidance was effective for interim periods ending after june15, 2009. the adoption of the guidance on april1, 2009 resulted in an increase in retained earnings of
$71million, which was offset by a corresponding decrease in "accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources" of the same amount.

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
accounting standards not yet adopted
accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts
in october 2010, the fasb issued updated guidance to address diversity in practice for the accounting for costs associated with
acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. this guidance modifies the definition of acquisition costs to specify that a cost must be directly related to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal
insurance contract in order to be deferred. if application of this guidance would result in the capitalization of acquisition costs that had not previously been capitalized by a reporting entity, the
entity may elect not to capitalize those costs.
the
updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending march31, 2012. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have any effect on the company's results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.
transfers and servicing
in april 2011, the fasb issued updated guidance related to the accounting for repurchase agreements and other agreements that entitle
and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity. the updated guidance eliminates the criteria to assess whether a transferor is required to have the ability to
repurchase or redeem the financial assets in order to demonstrate effective control over the transferred asset. transferors that maintain effective control over a transferred asset are required to
account for the transaction as a secured borrowing rather than a sale.
the
updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending march31, 2012. the updated guidance applies to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or
after the effective date. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have any effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
presentation of comprehensive income
in june 2011, the fasb issued updated guidance to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income by
eliminating the option of presenting components of comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders' equity. the updated guidance requires that all nonowner changes in
shareholders' equity be presented either as a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. the updated guidance is to be applied retrospectively
and is effective for the quarter ending march31, 2012. early adoption is permitted.
the
updated guidance will result in a change in the presentation of the company's consolidated financial statements but will not have any impact on the company's results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.
intangiblesgoodwill and other
in september 2011, the fasb issued updated guidance that modifies the manner in which the two-step impairment test of
goodwill is applied. under the updated guidance, an entity may assess qualitative factors (such as changes in management, key personnel,
strategy, key technology, or customers) that may impact a reporting unit's fair value and lead to the determination that it is more
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
likely
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. if an entity determines that it is more likely than not, it must perform an impairment
test.
the
first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the carrying value of a reporting unit
exceeds the estimated fair value, a second step must be performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. in the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is
determined in the same manner as goodwill is measured in a business combination (i.e.,by measuring the fair value of the reporting unit's assets, liabilities and unrecognized intangible assets
and determining the remaining amount ascribed to goodwill) and comparing the amount of the implied goodwill to the carrying amount of the goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill
exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
the
updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending march31, 2012. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the company's results of
operations, financial position or liquidity.
accounting policies
investments
fixed maturity and equity securities
fixed maturities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks. fixed maturities, including instruments subject to securities
lending agreements, are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to accumulated
other changes in equity from nonowner sources. equity securities, which include public common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are classified as available for sale with changes in fair
value, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources.
real estate investments
the company's real estate investments include warehouses, office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly
owned. real estate is recorded on the purchase date at the purchase price, which generally represents fair value, and is supported by internal analysis or external appraisals, using discounted cash
flow analyses and other acceptable valuation techniques. real estate held for investment purposes is subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. buildings are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the expected useful life of the building or 39years. real estate held for sale is carried at lower of cost or fair value, less estimated
cost to sell.
short-term securities
short-term securities have an original maturity of less than one year and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates
fair value.
other investments
investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
the
company uses the equity method of accounting for private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. the partnerships and the hedge funds generally report
investments on their balance sheet at fair value. the financial statements prepared by the investee are received by the company on a lag basis, with the lag period generally dependent upon the type of
underlying investments. the private equity and real estate partnerships provide financial information quarterly which is generally available to investors, including the company, within three to six
months following the date of the reporting period. the hedge funds provide financial information monthly, which is generally available to investors within one month following the date of the reporting
period. the company regularly requests financial information from the partnerships prior to the receipt of the partnerships' financial statements and records any material information obtained from
these requests in its consolidated financial statements.
common
stock with transfer restrictions and other
also
included in other investments are common stock with transfer restrictions, non-public common and preferred equities, mortgage loans, trading securities and derivatives.
common stock with transfer restrictions and non-public common and preferred equities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value, net of income taxes, charged or credited
directly to accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources. mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost. trading securities are marked to market with the change in fair value recognized in
net investment income during the current period. the company's derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value, with the changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statement of
income in net realized investment gains (losses). for a further discussion of the derivatives used by the company, see note3.
net investment income
investment income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized based on the constant effective yield method which includes an
adjustment for estimated principal repayments, if any. the effective yield used to determine amortization for fixed maturities subject to prepayment risk (e.g.,asset-backed,
loan-backed and structured securities) is recalculated and adjusted periodically based upon actual historical and/or projected future cash flows, which are obtained from a widely-accepted
securities data provider. the adjustments to the yield for highly rated
prepayable fixed maturities are accounted for using the retrospective method. the adjustments to the yield for non-highly rated prepayable fixed maturities are accounted for using the
prospective method. dividends on equity securities (including those with transfer restrictions) and venture capital investments are recognized in income when declared. rental income on real estate is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. see note3 for further discussion. investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships
and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the company's share of the investee's earnings or losses in the fund is reported in net investment income. trading
securities are marked to market with the change in fair value recognized in net investment income during the current period.
accrual
of income is suspended on non-securitized fixed maturities or mortgage loans that are in default, or on which it is likely that future payments will not be made as
scheduled. interest income on investments in default is recognized only when payments are received. investments included in the consolidated balance sheet that were not income-producing for the
preceding 12months were not material.

for
fixed maturities where the company records an other-than-temporary impairment, a determination is made as to the cause of the impairment and whether the
company expects a recovery in the value. for fixed maturities where the company expects a recovery in value, not necessarily to par, the constant effective yield method is utilized and the investment
is amortized to the expected recovery amount.
investment gains and losses
net realized investment gains and losses are included as a component of pretax revenues based upon specific identification of the
investments sold on the trade date. included in net realized investment gains (losses) are other-than-temporary impairment losses on invested assets other than those
investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting as described in the "investment impairments" section that follows.
investment impairments
the company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary
impairments. some of the factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1)for fixed maturity investments, whether the company intends to
sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2)for non-fixed
maturity investments, the company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3)the likelihood of
the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities (i.e.,whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4)the length of time and extent to
which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5)the financial condition, near-term and
long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices.
other-than-temporary
impairments of fixed maturities and equity securities
for
fixed maturity investments that the company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company would not be required to sell before an anticipated
recovery in value, the company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains
(losses). the impairment related to all other factors is reported in accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources.
for
equity securities (including public common, non-redeemable preferred stock and common stock with transfer restrictions) and for fixed maturity investments the company
intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized
investment gains (losses).
upon
recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the
other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains (losses). the new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however,
for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis and the expected

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
cash
flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment.
determination of credit loss
the company determines the credit loss component of fixed maturity investments by utilizing discounted cash flow modeling to determine
the present value of the security and comparing the present value with the amortized cost of the security. if the amortized cost is greater than the present value of the expected cash flows, the
difference is considered a credit loss and recognized in net realized investment gains (losses).
for
non-structured fixed maturities (u.s. treasury securities, obligations of u.s. government and government agencies and authorities, obligations of states, municipalities
and political subdivisions, debt securities issued by foreign governments, and certain corporate debt), the estimate of expected cash flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery
time frame and assessing whether further principal and interest will be received. the determination of recovery value incorporates an issuer valuation assumption utilizing one or a combination of
valuation methods as deemed appropriate by the company. the company determines the undiscounted recovery value by allocating the estimated value of the issuer to the company's assessment of the
priority of claims. the present value of the cash flows is determined by applying the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the
security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment) and an estimated recovery time frame. generally, that time frame for securities for which the issuer is in bankruptcy is
12months. for securities for which the issuer is financially troubled but not in bankruptcy, that time frame is generally 24months. included in the present value calculation are
expected principal and interest payments; however, for securities for which the issuer is classified as bankrupt or in default, the present value calculation assumes no interest payments and a single
recovery amount.
in
estimating the recovery value, significant judgment is involved in the development of assumptions relating to a myriad of factors related to the issuer including, but not limited to,
revenue, margin and earnings projections, the likely market or liquidation values of assets, potential additional debt to be incurred pre- or post-bankruptcy/restructuring, the
ability to shift existing or new debt to different priority layers, the amount of restructuring/bankruptcy expenses, the size and priority of unfunded pension obligations, litigation or other
contingent claims, the treatment of intercompany claims and the likely outcome with respect to inter-creditor conflicts.
for
structured fixed maturity securities (primarily residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities),
the company estimates the present value of the security by projecting future cash flows of the assets underlying the securitization, allocating the flows to the various tranches based on the structure
of the securitization, and determining the present value of the cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the
security if the implied rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment or changes in expected cash flows). the company incorporates levels of delinquencies, defaults and severities as well as
credit attributes of the remaining assets in the securitization, along with other economic data, to arrive at its best estimate of the parameters applied to the assets underlying the securitization.
in order to project cash flows, the following assumptions are applied to the assets underlying the securitization: (1)voluntary prepayment rates, (2)default rates and

real estate investments
on
at least an annual basis, the company obtains independent appraisals for substantially all of its real estate investments. in addition, the carrying value
of all real estate investments is reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. the review for
impairment considers the valuation from the independent appraisal, when applicable, and incorporates an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the real estate property. an impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the real estate property. the impairment loss is the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value.
other investments
investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships
included
in other investments are private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships that generally report investments on their balance sheet at fair value and
are accounted for by the company using the equity method of accounting. the company reviews these investments for impairment no less frequently than quarterly and monitors the performance throughout
the year through discussions with the managers/general partners. if the company becomes aware of an impairment of a partnership's investments at the balance sheet date prior to receiving the
partnership's financial statements, it will recognize an impairment by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the partnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income.
mortgage loans
a
mortgage loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect principal and interest amounts due. for mortgage loans that are determined to be
impaired, a reserve is established for the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the underlying collateral. in estimating fair value, the company uses interest rates reflecting
the current real estate financing market returns.
changes in intent to sell temporarily impaired assets
the
company may, from time to time, sell invested assets subsequent to the balance sheet date that it did not intend to sell at the balance sheet date.
conversely, the company may not sell invested assets that it asserted that it intended to sell at the balance sheet date. such changes in intent are generally due to events occurring subsequent to the
balance sheet date. the types of events that may result in a change in intent include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances related to the invested asset
(e.g.,a downgrade or upgrade from a
rating agency), significant unforeseen changes in liquidity needs, or changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment.

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
securities lending
the company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its
investments to other institutions for short periods of time. borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest.
this collateral is held by a third-party custodian, and the company has the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution borrowing the company's securities is in default under
the lending agreement. therefore, the company does not recognize the receipt of the collateral held by the third-party custodian or the obligation to return the collateral. the loaned securities
remain a recorded asset of the company. the company accepts only cash as collateral for securities on loan and restricts the manner in which that cash is invested.
reinsurance recoverables
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. the company reports its
reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. the allowance is based upon the company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection
periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. amounts deemed to be uncollectible, including amounts due from known insolvent
reinsurers, are written off against the allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. any subsequent collections of amounts previously written off are reported as part of claims and
claim adjustment expenses. the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from
reinsurer insolvencies.
deferred acquisition costs
amounts which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new insurance contracts, consisting of commissions and
premium-related taxes, are deferred and amortized pro rata over the contract periods in which the related premiums are earned. deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are
recoverable from future income and, if not, are charged to expense. future investment income attributable to related premiums is taken into account in measuring the recoverability of the carrying
value of this asset. all other acquisition expenses are charged to operations as incurred.
contractholder receivables and payables
under certain workers' compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, the company is obligated to pay the claimant for the
full amount of the claim. the company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. these amounts are included on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet in
contractholder payables and contractholder receivables, respectively.
goodwill and other intangible assets
the company performs a review, on at least an annual basis, of goodwill held by the reporting units which are the company's three
operating and reportable segments: business insurance; financial, professional& international insurance; and personal insurance. the company estimates the fair value
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
of
its reporting units and compares it to their carrying value, including goodwill. if the carrying values of the reporting units were to exceed their fair value, the amount of the impairment would be
calculated and goodwill adjusted accordingly.
the
company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. the discounted cash flow model is an income approach to valuation that is based on a
detailed cash flow analysis for deriving a current fair value of reporting units and is representative of the company's reporting units' current and expected future financial performance. other
indefinite-lived intangible assets held by the company are also reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis. the classification of the asset as indefinite-lived is reassessed and an impairment
is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
intangible
assets that are deemed to have a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives. the carrying amount of intangible assets with a finite useful life is regularly
reviewed for indicators of impairment in value. impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the
difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
the
company's review did not result in an impairment of its goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangibles or finite-lived intangible assets, and none of the company's reporting units had
a reasonable risk of failing the initial impairment test for the years ended december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent estimates for the ultimate cost of unpaid reported and unreported claims
incurred and related expenses. the reserves are adjusted regularly based upon experience. included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in the consolidated balance sheet are certain
reserves discounted to the present value of estimated future payments. the liabilities for losses for most long-term disability and annuity claim payments, primarily arising from workers'
compensation insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies, were discounted using a rate of 5% at both december31, 2011 and 2010. these discounted reserves totaled
$2.20billion and $2.09billion at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
the
company performs a continuing review of its claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, including its reserving techniques and its reinsurance. the reserves are also reviewed
regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company. since the reserves are based on estimates, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such reserves. the effects of changes in such
estimated reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. such changes in estimates could occur in a future period and may be material to the
company's results of operations and financial position in such period.
other liabilities
included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet is the company's estimate of its liability for guaranty fund and other
insurance-related assessments. the liability for expected state guaranty fund and other premium-based assessments is recognized as the company writes or becomes obligated to write or renew the
premiums on which the assessments are expected to be based. the liability for loss-based assessments is recognized as the related losses are incurred. at december31, 2011 and 2010,
the company had a liability of $293million and $294million, respectively, for guaranty
table of contents

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
fund
and other insurance-related assessments and related recoverables of $19million and $24million, respectively. the liability for such assessments and the related recoverables are
not discounted for the time value of money. the loss-based assessments are expected to be paid over a period ranging from one year to the life expectancy of certain workers' compensation
claimants and the recoveries are expected to occur over the same period of time.
also
included in other liabilities is an accrual for policyholder dividends. certain insurance contracts, primarily workers' compensation, are participating whereby dividends are paid to
policyholders in accordance with contract provisions. net written premiums for participating dividend policies were approximately 1% of total company net written premiums for each of the years ended
december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. policyholder dividends are accrued against earnings using best available estimates of amounts to be paid. the liability accrued for policyholder dividends
totaled $54million and $45million at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
treasury stock
treasury stock represents the cost of common stock repurchased by the company, which stock represents authorized and unissued shares of
the company under the minnesota business corporation act.
statutory accounting practices
the company's insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the state of connecticut, prepare statutory financial statements in
accordance with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance departments of the states of domicile. prescribed statutory accounting practices are those practices that are
incorporated directly or by reference in state laws, regulations, and general administrative rules applicable to all insurance enterprises domiciled in a particular state. permitted statutory
accounting practices include practices not prescribed by the domiciliary state, but allowed by the domiciliary state regulatory authority. the impact of any permitted accounting practices on
policyholders' surplus of the company is not material.
premiums and unearned premium reserves
premiums are recognized as revenues pro rata over the policy period. unearned premium reserves represent the unexpired portion of
policy premiums. accrued retrospective premiums are included in premium balances receivable. premium balances receivable are reported net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible premium amounts.
ceded
premiums are charged to income over the applicable term of the various reinsurance contracts with third party reinsurers. prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired
portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as part of other assets.
reinsurance to close
under the accounting conventions used by lloyd's members, each underwriting account is normally kept open for three years and the
underwriting results determined at the end of the third year when the account is closed, although a longer period may be required in order to determine reserves at the required degree of
accuracy/confidence for exposures having significant uncertainty. when a year of account is closed, a reinsurance contract (the "reinsurance to close" or ritc) is entered into with a
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
subsequent
year of account (normally the following year of account) in consideration for which all subsequent underwriting transactions resulting from the closing year and all previous years reinsured
therein are brought forward to (accepted by) the subsequent year of account.
the
amount of the assets received in an ritc is equal to the accepted claims including incurred but not reported (ibnr) claims and is undiscounted for the time value of money.
accordingly, there is no gain or loss at the time the assets and liabilities are acquired and recognized by the subsequent year of account. in addition, there is no impact on reported premiums and
losses as a result of an ritc transaction.
fee income
fee income includes servicing fees from carriers and revenues from large deductible policies and service contracts and is recognized
pro rata over the contract or policy periods.
other revenues
other revenues include revenues from premium installment charges, which are recognized as collected, revenues of noninsurance
subsidiaries other than fee income and gains and losses on dispositions of assets and redemption of debt, and other miscellaneous revenues.
income taxes
the company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax effects attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. the effect of a change in tax laws or rates
on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not
that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
foreign currency translation
the company assigns functional currencies to its foreign operations, which are generally the currencies of the local operating
environment. foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the functional currency, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in earnings. functional currency amounts are then
translated into u.s. dollars. the foreign currency remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for items reported in the balance sheets and average exchange rates for
items recorded in earnings. the change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year, net of tax, is a component of accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources.
share-based compensation
the company has an employee stock incentive compensation plan that permits grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock, stock units, performance awards and other stock-based or stock-denominated awards with respect to the company's common stock.
table of contents

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
compensation
cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of an award, utilizing the assumptions discussed in note12. compensation cost is recognized for
financial reporting purposes over the period in which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). in connection with certain share-based
awards, participants are entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, either in cash or dividend equivalent shares, commensurate with the dividends paid to common shareholders. dividends
and dividend equivalent shares on awards that are expected to vest are recorded in retained earnings. dividends on awards that are not expected to vest are not subject to forfeiture and are,
therefore, recorded as compensation expense.
nature of operations
the company is organized into three reportable business segments: business insurance; financial, professional& international
insurance; and personal insurance. these segments reflect the manner in which the company's businesses are currently managed and represent an aggregation of products and services based on type of
customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which risks are underwritten.
the
specific business segments are as follows:
business insurance
the business insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services to its clients
primarily in the united states. business insurance is organized into the following six groups, which collectively comprise business insurance core

based on market share. the company's investment in jmalucelli is accounted for using the equity method and is included in "other investments" on the consolidated balance sheet.
personal insurance
the personal insurance segment writes a broad range of property and casualty insurance covering individuals' personal risks. the
primary products of automobile and homeowners insurance are complemented by a broad suite of related coverages.
automobile
policies provide coverage for liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage, uninsured motorist protection, and for physical damage to an insured's own
vehicle from collision. in addition, many states require policies to provide first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.

writes homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and tenants, and rental properties. the company writes coverage for boats and yachts and valuable personal items such as jewelry, and also
writes coverages for umbrella liability, identity fraud, and weddings and special events.
2. segment information
the company is organized into three reportable business segments: business insurance; financial, professional& international insurance; and personal insurance. the accounting
policies used to generate the following segment data are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note1.
except
as described below for certain legal entities, the company allocates its invested assets and the related net investment income to its reportable business segments. pretax net
investment income is allocated based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each
segment. for investable funds, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the estimated duration of the loss reserves' future cash flows, the interest rate environment at the time the
losses were incurred and a+ rated corporate debt instrument yields. for capital, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the average yield on the total investment portfolio. the
benchmark investment yields are applied to each segment's investable funds and capital, respectively, to produce a total notional investment income by segment. the company's actual net investment
income is allocated to each segment in proportion to the respective segment's notional investment income to total notional investment income. there are certain legal entities within the company that
are dedicated to specific reportable business segments. the invested assets and related net investment income from these legal

real estate
the company's real estate investments include warehouses, office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly
owned. the company negotiates commercial leases with individual tenants through unrelated, licensed real estate brokers. negotiated terms and conditions include, among others, rental rates, length of
lease period and improvements to the premises to be provided by the landlord.
in
2011 and 2009, there were no sales of real estate investments. proceeds from the sale of real estate investments totaled $10million in 2010. gross gains of $3million
were realized on those sales and there were no gross losses. the company had no real estate held for sale at december31, 2011 and 2010. accumulated depreciation on real estate held for
investment purposes was $226million and $200million at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
future
minimum rental income expected on operating leases relating to the company's real estate properties is $80million, $72million, $62million,
$53million, $36million for 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and $56million for 2017 and thereafter.
short-term securities
the company's short-term securities consist of aaa-rated registered money market funds, u.s. treasury
securities and high-quality commercial paper (primarily a1/p1) with a combined average of 79days to maturity at december31, 2011. the amortized cost of these securities,
which totaled $3.59billion and $5.62billion at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, approximated their fair value.
variable interest entities
entities which do not have sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support
or in which the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of a controlling financial interest are referred to as variable interest entities (vie). a vie is consolidated by the
variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest (primary beneficiary) as a result of having both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most
significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. the company
determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of an entity subject to consolidation based on a qualitative assessment of the vie's capital structure, contractual terms, nature of the vie's
operations and purpose and the company's relative exposure to the related risks of the vie on the date it becomes initially involved in the vie. the company reassesses its vie determination with
respect to an entity on an ongoing basis.
the
company is a passive investor in limited partner equity interests issued by third party vies. these include certain of the company's investments in private equity limited
partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships where the company is not related to the general partner. these investments are generally accounted for under the equity method and reported in
the company's consolidated balance sheet as other investments unless the company is deemed the primary beneficiary. these equity interests generally cannot be redeemed. distributions from these
investments are received by the company as a result of liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds and/or as income

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
3. investments (continued)
distribution.
the company's maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the company's consolidated balance sheet and any
unfunded commitment. neither the carrying amounts nor the unfunded commitments related to these vies are material.
unrealized investment losses
the following tables summarize, for all investments in an unrealized loss position at december31, 2011 and 2010, the aggregate
fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of
time those securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position. the fair value amounts reported in the tables are estimates that are prepared using the process described in note4.
the company also relies upon estimates of several factors in its review and evaluation of individual investments, using the process described in note1, in determining whether such investments
are other-than-temporarily impaired.

concentrations and credit quality
concentrations of credit risk arise from exposure to counterparties that are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic
characteristics that could cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
the company seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties, obtaining collateral as deemed appropriate, and applying controls that include credit
approvals, limits of credit exposure, and other monitoring procedures.
at
december31, 2011 and 2010, other than u.s. treasury securities and obligations of u.s. government and government agencies and authorities, the company was not exposed to any
concentration of credit risk of a single issuer greater than 5% of shareholders' equity of the company.
included
in fixed maturities are below investment grade assets totaling $1.96billion and $1.88billion at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the company
defines its below investment grade assets as those securities rated below investment grade by external rating agencies, or the equivalent by the company when a public rating does not exist. such
assets include publicly traded below investment grade bonds and certain other privately issued bonds that are classified as below investment grade loans.

the company uses u.s. treasury note futures transactions to modify the effective duration of specific assets within the investment
portfolio and enters into 90-day futures contracts on 2-year, 5-year, 10-year and 30-year u.s. treasury notes which require a daily
mark-to-market and settlement with the broker. the notional value of the open u.s. treasury futures contracts was $900million and $400million at
december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. net realized investment gains in 2011, 2010 and 2009 included net losses of $62million, net losses of $30million and net gains of
$23million, respectively, related to u.s. treasury futures contracts.
in
2010 and 2009, the company recorded net realized investment gains of $5million and $7million, respectively, related to its holdings of six million stock purchase
warrants of platinum underwriters holdings,ltd., a publicly-held company. these warrants were not designated and did not qualify for hedge accounting, and, as such, the
mark-to-market changes in fair value were reflected in net realized investment gains (losses). in october 2010, the company sold these stock purchase warrants for proceeds that
approximated their carrying value at the date of sale.

the
company purchases investments that have embedded derivatives, primarily convertible debt securities. these embedded derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in value
reflected in net realized investment gains (losses). derivatives embedded in convertible debt securities are reported on a combined basis with their host instrument and are classified as fixed
maturity securities. the company recorded a net realized investment loss of $2million in 2011, a net realized investment loss of $1million in 2010 and a net realized investment gain of
$1million in 2009 related to these embedded derivatives.
4. fair value measurements
the company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. the framework is based
on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. the disclosure of fair
value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the
estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the company's significant market
assumptions. the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. the
three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:
level1unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in
active markets that the company has the ability to access.
level2quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;
quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g.,interest rates, yield curves,
prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.
level3valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable.
the unobservable inputs reflect the company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use.
valuation of investments reported at fair value in financial statements
the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction
between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e.,not in a forced transaction. the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the
security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g.,a forced transaction. additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based
inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.
for
investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in
level1 of the hierarchy. the company receives the quoted market prices from a third party, nationally recognized pricing service (pricing service). when quoted market prices are unavailable,
the company utilizes a pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value, which is mainly used for its fixed
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
4. fair value measurements (continued)
maturity
investments. the fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. if quoted market prices and an estimate from
a pricing service are unavailable, the company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the level of observable market inputs, will
render the fair value estimate as level2 or level3. the company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third-party market
participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction.
fixed maturities
the company utilizes a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities. the pricing
service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. since fixed maturities other than u.s. treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily
basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which include available relevant market information, benchmark
curves, benchmarking of like securities,
sector groupings and matrix pricing. additionally, the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.
the
pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. the market inputs utilized
in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark
securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. the extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions. depending on the security,
the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. for some securities, additional inputs may be necessary.
the
pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. if
the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to
make assumptions for market-based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions.
the
fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed
maturities, other than u.s. treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. the estimated fair value of u.s. treasury
securities is included in the amount disclosed in level1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.
the
company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an internal matrix that
is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. the underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the u.s. treasury curve are
the bofa merrill lynch u.s. corporate index and the bofa merrill lynch high yield bb rated index. the company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in level2, since all
significant inputs are market observable.

while
the vast majority of the company's municipal bonds are included in level2, the company holds a small number of municipal bonds which are not valued by the pricing service
and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. due to the limited amount of observable market
information, the company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in level3. additionally, the company holds a small
amount of other fixed maturity investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. for these fixed maturities, the company obtains a quote from a broker (typically a
market maker). due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the company includes these fair value estimates in level3.
equitiespublic common and preferred
for public common and preferred stocks, the company receives prices from a nationally recognized pricing service that are based on
observable market transactions and includes these estimates in the amount disclosed in level1. infrequently, current market quotes in active markets are unavailable for certain
non-redeemable preferred stocks held by the company. in these instances, the company receives an estimate of fair value from the pricing service that provides fair value estimates for the
company's fixed maturities. the service utilizes some of the same methodologies to price the non-redeemable preferred stocks as it does for the fixed maturities. the company includes the
fair value estimate for these non-redeemable preferred stocks in the amount disclosed in level2.
at
december31, 2010, the estimated fair value of stocks having transfer restrictions that expired within one year was determined by adjusting the observed market price of the
securities for a liquidity discount which takes into consideration the restrictions that existed at december31, 2010 and was based on market observable inputs. as a result of adjusting the
market price to reflect the impact of the transfer restrictions on estimated fair value, the company disclosed these holdings in level2 at december31, 2010. at december31,
2011, the company held no stocks having transfer restrictions that expired within one year.
other investments
the company holds investments in various publicly-traded securities which are reported in other investments. these investments include
securities in the company's trading portfolio, mutual funds and other small holdings. the $42million fair value of these investments at both december31, 2011 and 2010 was disclosed in
level1. at december31, 2011 and 2010, the company held investments in non-public common and preferred equity securities, with fair value estimates of $44million and
$57million, respectively, reported in other investments, where the fair value estimate is determined either internally or by an external fund manager based on recent filings, operating
results, balance sheet stability, growth and other business and market sector fundamentals. due to the significant unobservable inputs in these valuations, the company includes the total fair value
estimate for all of these investments at december31, 2011 and 2010 in the amount disclosed in level3.
derivatives
at december31, 2011 and 2010, the company held $22million and $37million, respectively, of convertible bonds
containing embedded conversion options that are valued separately from the host bond contract in the amount disclosed in level2fixed maturities.

the
company had no financial assets or financial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended december31, 2011 and
2010.
financial instruments disclosed, but not carried, at fair value
the company uses various financial instruments in the normal course of its business. the company's insurance contracts are excluded
from fair value of financial instruments accounting guidance and, therefore, are not included in the amounts discussed below.
the
carrying values of cash, short-term securities and investment income accrued approximated their fair values.
the
carrying values of $552million and $647million of financial instruments classified as other assets approximated their fair values at december31, 2011 and
2010, respectively. the carrying values of $3.93billion and $3.75billion of financial instruments classified as other liabilities at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively,
also approximated their fair values. fair value is determined using various methods including discounted cash flows, as appropriate for the various financial instruments.
the
carrying value and fair value of the company's debt at december31, 2011 was $6.61billion and $7.71billion, respectively. the respective totals at
december31, 2010 were $6.61billion and $7.21billion. the company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 93% and 94% of its debt, other
than commercial paper, at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the pricing service utilizes market quotations for debt that have quoted prices in active markets. for the small amount of
the company's debt securities for which a pricing service is not used, the company utilizes pricing estimates from a nationally recognized broker/dealer to estimate fair value. if estimates of fair
value are unavailable from the pricing service or the broker/dealer, the

company
produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques which are based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporates all available relevant observable
market inputs.
the
fair value of commercial paper included in debt outstanding at december31, 2011 and 2010 approximated its book value because of its short-term nature.
5. reinsurance
the company's consolidated financial statements reflect the effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions. assumed reinsurance refers to the acceptance of certain insurance risks
that other insurance companies have underwritten. ceded reinsurance involves transferring certain insurance risks (along with the related written and earned premiums) the company has underwritten to
other insurance companies who agree to share these risks. the primary purpose of ceded reinsurance is to protect the company, at a cost, from losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept.
reinsurance is placed on both a quota-share and excess of loss basis. ceded reinsurance arrangements do not discharge the company as the primary insurer, except for instances where the primary policy
or policies have been novated.
the
company utilizes general catastrophe reinsurance treaties with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage its exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes. in addition to the coverage
provided under these treaties, the company also utilizes a catastrophe bond program and a northeast catastrophe reinsurance treaty to protect against losses resulting from catastrophes in the
northeastern united states. the company also utilizes an excess-of-loss treaty in its national property business unit of the business insurance segment to protect against
earthquake losses up to a certain threshold.
the
company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
insolvencies. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the company may become involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and
arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. the company employs dedicated specialists and strategies
to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.
included
in reinsurance recoverables are certain amounts related to involuntary reinsurance arrangements. the company is required to participate in various involuntary reinsurance
arrangements through assumed reinsurance, principally with regard to residual market mechanisms in workers'
compensation and automobile insurance, as well as homeowners' insurance in certain coastal areas. in addition, the company provides services for several of these involuntary arrangements ("mandatory
pools and associations") under which it writes such residual market business directly, then cedes 100% of this business to the mandatory pool. such participations and servicing arrangements are
arranged to mitigate credit risk to the company, as any ceded balances are jointly backed by all the pool members.
also
included in reinsurance recoverables are certain amounts related to structured settlements. structured settlements are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to
settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant, the
structured settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables as the company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required
annuity payments, the company would be required to make such payments if and to the extent not paid by state guaranty associations.

terrorism risk insurance program
the terrorism risk insurance program (the program) is a federal program administered by the department of the treasury that provides
for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest. the program has been
authorized through 2014.
in
order for a loss to be covered under the program (subject losses), the loss must meet certain aggregate industry loss minimums and must be the result of an event that is certified as
an act of terrorism by the u.s. secretary of the treasury, in concurrence with the secretary of state and the attorney general of the united states. the annual aggregate industry loss minimum is
$100million through 2014. the program excludes from participation the following types of insurance: federal crop

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
5. reinsurance (continued)
insurance,
private mortgage insurance, financial guaranty insurance, medical malpractice insurance, health or life insurance, flood insurance, reinsurance, commercial automobile, professional
liability (other than directors and officers'), surety, burglary and theft, and farm-owners multi-peril. in the case of a war declared by congress, only workers' compensation losses are
covered by the program. all commercial property and casualty insurers licensed in the united states are generally required to participate in the program. under the program, a participating insurer is
entitled
to be reimbursed by the federal government for 85% of subject losses, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap.
the
deductible for any calendar year is equal to 20% of the insurer's direct earned premiums for covered lines for the preceding calendar year. the company's estimated deductible under
the program is $2.17billion for 2012. the annual cap limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100billion. once subject losses have reached the
$100billion aggregate during a program year, participating insurers will not be liable under the program for additional covered terrorism losses for that program year. the company has had no
terrorism-related losses since the program was established. since the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how they will be applied to specific circumstances.
it is also possible that future legislative action could change the program. further, given the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism losses, as well as the limited terrorism coverage in
the company's own reinsurance program, future losses from acts of terrorism, particularly involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could be material to the company's operating
results, financial position and/or liquidity in future periods. while the company seeks to manage its exposure to man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means, there can be no
assurance that the company would have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or more man-made catastrophic events involving nuclear, biological, chemical or
radiological means.

(1)the
fair value adjustment of $191million was recorded in connection with the merger of the st.paul companies,inc. and travelers
property casualty corp. in 2004 and was based on management's estimate of nominal claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables (after adjusting for conformity with the
acquirer's accounting policy on discounting of workers' compensation reserves), expected payment patterns, the april1, 2004 u.s. treasury spot rate yield curve, a leverage ratio assumption
(reserves to statutory surplus), and a cost of capital expressed as a spread over risk-free rates. the method used calculates a risk adjustment to a risk-free discounted
reserve that will, if reserves run off as expected, produce results that yield the assumed cost-of-capital on the capital supporting the loss reserves. the fair value
adjustment is reported as an other intangible asset on the consolidated balance sheet, and the amounts measured in accordance with the acquirer's accounting policies for insurance contracts are
reported as part of the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. the intangible asset will be recognized into income over the expected payment pattern. because the
time value of money and the risk adjustment (cost of capital) components of the intangible asset run off at different rates, the amount recognized in income may be a net benefit in some periods and a
net expense in other periods.

gross
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at december31, 2011 and 2010 decreased by $184million and $1.99billion from the respective prior
year-end, primarily reflecting ongoing claims and claim adjustment expense activity, including losses incurred and payments made, as well as net favorable prior year reserve development
and payments related to operations in runoff, partially offset by the significant catastrophe losses incurred in 2011 and growth in business volume.
the
$848million decline in reinsurance recoverables at december31, 2011 compared with the prior year reflected cash collections and the impact of net favorable prior year
reserve development. the $1.31billion decline in reinsurance recoverables at december31, 2010 compared with the prior year-end primarily reflected cash collections and the
impact of net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.
prior year reserve development
the following disclosures regarding reserve development are on a "net of reinsurance" basis.
2011.
in 2011, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $842million of net favorable development for claims
arising in prior years, including $715million of net favorable prior year reserve development impacting the company's results of operations, which excludes $45million of accretion of
discount. overall, accident years prior to and including 2009 experienced $1.10billion of net favorable reserve development, while the 2010 accident year experienced $383million of net
unfavorable reserve development.
business insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was $245million, primarily driven by better than
expected loss
development in the general liability product line (excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves discussed below) which was concentrated in excess coverages for accident years
2005-2008 and reflected what the company believes are more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected, as well as net favorable prior year reserve
development in the property product line that reflected better than expected loss development for the 2008 and 2009 accident years. the workers' compensation line of business also contributed slightly
to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011, as favorable loss development for the 2003-2009 accident years was largely offset by net unfavorable loss development for the 2010
accident year. these factors were partially offset by $175million and $76million increases to asbestos and environmental reserves in 2011, respectively (discussed in further detail in
the "asbestos and environmental reserves" section below), unfavorable prior year reserve development in the commercial multi-peril product line driven by late reporting of hail claims incurred in 2010
and unfavorable prior year reserve development in the commercial automobile product line that reflected worse than expected severity for the 2009-2010 accident years.
financial, professional& international insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was $360million.
in
bond& financial products, net favorable development in 2011 primarily reflected better than expected results for accident years 2008 and prior for the contract surety business, and better than
expected loss development for liability lines of business, driven by the fiduciary product for accident years 2008 and prior. in international, net favorable development in 2011 reflected better than
expected loss development in canada, primarily in the surety, directors and officers, and general liability lines of business for recent accident years and better than expected development in the

personal insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was $110million, driven by better than expected loss
development
related to catastrophe losses incurred in the first half of 2010, as well as better than expected loss development in the 2006-2010 accident years for the umbrella line of business in the
homeowners and other product line, partially offset by unfavorable prior year reserve development in the automobile product line that was driven by worse than expected loss experience for the
2007-2010 accident years.
2010.
in 2010, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $1.42billion of net favorable development for claims
arising in prior years, including $1.25billion of net favorable prior year reserve development impacting the company's results of operations, which excludes $45million of accretion of
discount.
business insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 totaled $901million, driven by better than expected loss
development
in the property, general liability (excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves discussed below) and workers' compensation product lines for multiple accident years, as well as in
assumed reinsurance, which is in runoff. the property product line improvement primarily occurred in the 2008 and 2009 accident years as a result of better than expected loss development in
industry-focused underwriting and target risk underwriting. the general liability product line improvement was concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior and reflected what the
company believes are more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected. net favorable prior year reserve development in the workers' compensation product line
was concentrated in accident years 2007 and prior and resulted from better than expected loss development. the improvement in assumed reinsurance resulted primarily from favorable resolutions of
claims and disputes from accident years 2002 and prior. in addition, better than expected loss development in the business insurance segment in recent years resulted in a favorable
re-estimation of reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses in 2010. the net favorable prior year reserve development in these product lines in 2010 was partially offset by
$140million and $35million increases to asbestos and environmental reserves, respectively.
financial, professional& international insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $259million in
2010. in
bond& financial products, net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 was driven by better than expected loss development in the surety and management liability lines of business due
to lower than expected claim activity and loss severity in the 2008 and prior accident years. in international, the majority of net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 occurred at the
company's operation at lloyd's, in canada and in the united kingdom.
personal insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development of $87million in 2010 was concentrated in the homeowners and
other product
line, primarily driven by favorable loss development in the 2008 and prior accident years, primarily for the umbrella line of business, partially offset by unfavorable loss development in the 2009
accident year for the homeowners line of business that was driven by higher than anticipated late-reported claims related to storms in 2009.

2009.
in 2009, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $1.45billion of net favorable development for claims
arising in prior years, including $1.33billion of net favorable prior year reserve development impacting the company's results of operations, which excludes $54million of accretion of
discount.
business insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $1.03billion in 2009, driven by better than expected
loss
development primarily concentrated in the general liability (excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves discussed below), commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and commercial
property product lines for recent accident years. the general liability and commercial multi-peril product lines experienced better than anticipated loss development that was attributable to several
factors, including what the company believes is improved legal and judicial environments, as well as enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim process initiatives. the commercial automobile line
of business experienced better than expected loss development that was attributable to what the company believes are more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously
expected, claim handling initiatives and improvements in auto safety technology. the commercial property product line improvement primarily occurred in the 2007 and 2008 accident years as a result of
better than expected loss development for certain large national property and inland marine exposures. in addition, the commercial property product line's 2005 accident year experience improved due to
the litigation environment relating to, and ongoing claim settlements for, hurricane katrina. the net favorable prior year reserve development in these product lines in 2009 was partially offset by a
$185million increase to asbestos reserves and a $70million increase to environmental reserves.
financial, professional& international insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $168million in
2009, driven by
better than expected loss development in international, particularly in the united kingdom and canada. in addition, the aviation and property lines of business at lloyd's experienced net favorable
prior year loss development in 2009. in bond& financial products, better than expected loss development for the contract surety business within the fidelity and surety product line for recent
accident years also resulted in net favorable prior year reserve development in 2009.
personal insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $135million in 2009, driven by favorable loss
development related to
hurricanes ike and katrina, as well as the 2007 california wildfires.
asbestos and environmental reserves
at december31, 2011 and 2010, the company's claims and claim adjustment expense reserves included $2.78billion and
$2.90billion, respectively, for asbestos and environmental-related claims, net of reinsurance.
it
is difficult to estimate the reserves for asbestos and environmental-related claims due to the vagaries of court coverage decisions, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, the
risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, including without limitation, those which are set forth below.

7. insurance claim reserves (continued)
asbestos reserves.because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the
company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. among the factors which the company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance
coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the
jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role
of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if
any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.
the
company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder
bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. the company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office, field office and assumed reinsurance and other
categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. in addition, the company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience,
year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to
establish asbestos reserves nor have the company's evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.
in
the third quarter of 2011, the company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review and noted the following
trends:
continued high level of litigation activity involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness;
an increase in severity for certain policyholders as a result of the continued high level of litigation activity;
stable payment patterns for a significant proportion of policyholders;
a further decrease in the number of large asbestos exposures confronting the company due to additional settlement
activity;
continued moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity; and
the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants.
while
the company believes that over the past several years there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the company's overall asbestos exposure, there nonetheless
remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims.
as
in prior years, the annual claim review considered active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and "non-product" liability. while the home office and
field office categories, which account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, experienced a slight reduction in the number of policyholders with open asbestos
claims compared with the prior year period, gross asbestos-related payments in these categories increased slightly in 2011 compared with 2010. payments on behalf of policyholders in these categories
continue to be influenced by the high
table of contents

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
7. insurance claim reserves (continued)
level
of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury continue to target previously peripheral defendants.
the
completion of these reviews and analyses in 2011 and 2010 resulted in $175million and $140million increases, respectively, in the company's net asbestos reserves,
primarily driven by increases in the company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders and higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance
accounts. the increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from recent payment trends being moderately higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the
current litigation environment discussed above. notwithstanding these trends, the company's overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods. the
increase in 2010 also reflected increases in costs of litigating asbestos-related coverage matters and was partially offset by a $70million benefit from the reduction in the allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance resulting from a favorable ruling related to a reinsurance dispute. in 2009, the company recorded a $185million increase in asbestos reserves, primarily driven by a
slight increase in the company's assumption for projected defense costs related to many policyholders.
net
asbestos losses paid in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $284million, $350million and $341million, respectively. approximately 19%, 32% and 41% of total net paid
losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the company's liability.
environmental reserves.in establishing environmental reserves, the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and
the anticipated
cost of resolution, if any. in the course of this analysis, the company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of
similar exposures. in addition, the company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total
number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each
site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the
company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of
non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. the evaluation of the exposure presented
by a policyholder can change as information concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves.
the
company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time. these policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower
tier defendants. further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient
clean-up technologies. over the past several years, the company has experienced generally favorable trends in overall environmental claim payments, in the number of new policyholders
tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. however, in 2011, the company increased its net
environmental reserves by $76million, primarily because the degree to which those favorable trends continued was less than anticipated. in 2010, the company
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
7. insurance claim reserves (continued)
increased
its net environmental reserves by $35million due to a modest upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders. the company
increased its net environmental reserves by $70million in 2009, due to a slight increase in the number of policyholders tendering claims for the first time and upward development in the
expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders.
asbestos and environmental reserves.as a result of the processes and procedures described above, management believes that the reserves
carried for
asbestos and environmental claims at december31, 2011 are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. however, the uncertainties surrounding the
final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject
to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation,
any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and
environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of
available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the company,
future developments pertaining to the company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to
policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. in addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of
policyholders and other defendants. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and
environmental claims. this environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges
to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until
settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in
bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental
reserves, the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, the company's estimate of claims and
claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that
could be material to the company's operating results in future periods.
catastrophe exposure
the company has geographic exposure to catastrophe losses, which can be caused by a variety of events, including, among others,
hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods and volcanic eruptions. catastrophes can also result from a
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
7. insurance claim reserves (continued)
terrorist
attack (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), explosions, infrastructure failures or as a consequence of political instability. the incidence and
severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the
severity of the event. most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily
populated. the company generally seeks to mitigate its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance.
there
are also risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of the
company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information
available to establish the reserves. complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution
exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage and business income interruption costs; and reinsurance
collectibility. the timing of a catastrophe's occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to us in estimating reserves for that reporting
period. the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.

2011 debt repayment.on june1, 2011, the company repaid the remaining $9million principal balance on its 7.22% real estate
non-recourse debt.
2010 debt issuanceon november1, 2010, the company issued $500million aggregate principal amount 3.90% senior notes that will mature

issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, totaled approximately $496million and $738million, respectively. interest on the senior
notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on november1 and may1 of each year. the senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the
company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a)100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be

or (b)the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of
redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current treasury
rate (as defined) plus 15 basis points for the 2020 senior notes and 20 basis points for the 2040 notes.
2010 debt payments and maturitiesprior to november2010, the company was subject to a replacement capital covenant that it had granted to the
holders of its 6.75% senior notes due june20, 2036 (the senior notes). the replacement capital covenant restricted the company's ability to repurchase its $1.00billion in outstanding
6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures due march15, 2067 (the debentures). in november2010, the company paid approximately
$4million to holders of the senior notes to terminate the replacement capital covenant. following the termination, the company purchased approximately $885million aggregate principal
amount of the debentures. a $60million pretax loss was recognized in 2010 related to these transactions.
on
september16, 2010, the company repaid the remaining $4million principal balance on its 7.81% private placement senior notes. on august23, 2010, the company's
$21million, 7.415% medium-term notes matured and were fully paid. on april15, 2010, the company's $250million, 8.125% senior notes matured and were fully paid. all
of these debt payments were made from internally generated funds.
description of debt
commercial paperthe company maintains an $800million commercial paper program, supported by a $1.0billion bank credit agreement that
expires on june10, 2013. (see "line of credit agreement" discussion that follows). interest rates on commercial paper issued in 2011 ranged from 0.1% to 0.3%, and in 2010 ranged from 0.2% to
0.3%.
senior notesthe company's various senior debt issues are unsecured obligations that rank equally with one another. interest payments are made
semi-annually. the company generally may redeem some or all of the notes prior to maturity in accordance with terms unique to each debt instrument.
junior subordinated debenturesthe company's $115million remaining aggregate principal amount of 6.25%
fixed-to-floating rate debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 6.25% from the date of issuance to, but excluding, march15, 2017, payable semi-annually
in arrears on march15 and september15. from and including march15, 2017, the debentures will bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month libor plus 2.215%, payable
quarterly on march15, june15, september15 and december15 of each year. the company can redeem the debentures at its option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after
march15, 2017 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest. the company can redeem the debentures at its option prior to
march15, 2017 (a)in whole at any time or in part from time to time or (b)in whole, but not in part, in the event of certain tax or rating agency events relating to the
debentures, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed and the applicable make-whole amount, in each case plus any accrued and unpaid
interest.
the
company has the right, on one or more occasions, to defer the payment of interest on the debentures. the company will not be required to settle deferred interest until it has

for
five consecutive years or, if earlier, made a payment of current interest during a deferral period. the company may defer interest for up to ten consecutive years without giving rise to an event
of default. deferred interest will accumulate additional interest at an annual rate equal to the annual interest rate then applicable to the debentures.
the
debentures have a final maturity date of march15, 2067 and a scheduled maturity date of march15, 2037. the company can redeem the debentures at its option any time
(as described above) using any source of funds, including cash. if the company chooses not to redeem the debentures, then during the 180-day period ending not more than 15 and not less
than ten business days prior to the scheduled maturity date, the company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell enough qualifying capital securities to permit repayment of the
debentures at the scheduled maturity date. if any debentures remain outstanding after the scheduled maturity date, unless and until the company redeems the debentures (as described above) using any
source of funds, including cash, the company shall be required to use its commercially reasonable efforts on a quarterly basis to raise sufficient proceeds from the sale of qualifying capital
securities to permit the repayment in full of the debentures. if there are remaining debentures at the final maturity date, the company is required to redeem the debentures using any source of funds.
qualifying capital securities are securities (other than common stock, qualifying warrants, mandatorily convertible preferred stock, debt exchangeable for common equity, and debt exchangeable for
preferred equity) which generally are treated by the ratings agencies as having similar equity content to the debentures.
the
company's three other junior subordinated debenture instruments are all similar in nature to each other. three separate business trusts issued preferred securities to investors and
used the proceeds to purchase the company's subordinated debentures. interest on each of the instruments is paid semi-annually.
the
company's consolidated balance sheet includes the debt instruments acquired in the merger, which were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. the resulting fair value
adjustment is being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments using the effective-interest method. the amortization of the fair value adjustment reduced interest expense by

line of credit agreement
the company is party to a three-year, $1.0billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial
institutions that expires in june2013. pursuant to the credit agreement covenants, the company must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth (generally defined as shareholders' equity plus
certain trust preferred and mandatorily convertible securities, reduced for goodwill and other intangible assets) of $14.35billion. the company must also maintain a ratio of total debt to the
sum of total debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than 0.40 to 1.00. in addition, the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of
default, including with respect to a change in control, which is defined to include the acquisition of 35% or more of the company's voting stock and certain changes in the composition of the company's
board of directors. at december31, 2011, the company was in compliance with these covenants. generally, the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from libor plus 100 basis points
to libor plus 175 basis points depending on the company's credit ratings. at december31, 2011, that cost would have been libor plus 125 basis points had there been any amounts outstanding
under the credit agreement. this line of credit also supports the company's commercial paper program.
shelf registration
in december2011, the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement for the
potential offering and sale of securities to replace the company's previous registration statement that had expired in the normal course of business. the company may offer these securities from time
to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering. during 2010, the company issued securities with a principal amount of $1.25billion under the prior shelf
registration statement.

the company's board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to
time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of rule10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, in private transactions or
otherwise. the authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the company's
financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements,
regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions), market conditions and other factors. the following table summarizes repurchase activity in 2011 and

the
company's amended and restated 2004 stock incentive plan provides settlement alternatives to employees in which the company retains shares to cover tax withholding costs and exercise
costs. during the years ended december31, 2011 and 2010, the company acquired $82million and $66million, respectively, of its common stock under this plan.
common
shares acquired are reported as treasury stock in the consolidated balance sheet.
preferred stock
the company's preferred shareholders' equity at december31, 2010 represented the par value of preferred shares outstanding
related to a legacy stock ownership plan (sop) trust which was subsequently merged into the travelers 401(k) savings plan (the savings plan). the sop trust could at any time convert any or all of the
preferred shares into shares of the company's common stock at a rate of eight shares of common stock for each preferred share. in may2011, the company's board of directors authorized the
redemption of the company's preferred stock held by the savings plan and gave notice of that redemption to the appropriate fiduciaries of the savings plan. following a fiduciary review, the savings
plan exercised its right to convert each preferred share into eight shares of the company's common stock. as a result, all preferred shares outstanding on june7, 2011 (190,083 shares) were
converted into a total of 1.52million shares of the company's common stock.
dividend availability
the company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends
available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. a maximum of $1.96billion is available by the end of 2012 for such dividends

insurance subsidiaries in 2011.

if
the company determines that any of its deferred tax assets will not result in future tax benefits, a valuation allowance must be established for the portion of these assets that are
not expected to be
realized. based upon a review of the company's anticipated future taxable income, and also including all other available evidence, both positive and negative, the company's management concluded that
it is more likely than not that the gross deferred tax assets will be realized.
for
tax return purposes, as of december31, 2011, the company had net operating loss (nol) carryforwards on a regular tax basis and an alternative minimum tax (amt) basis of
approximately $59million and $14million, respectively. these nol carryforwards expire, if unused, in 2018. in addition, the company has amt credit carryforwards of $95million
which are available to reduce future federal regular income taxes over an indefinite period. the amount and timing of realizing the benefits of nol and amt credit carryforwards depend on future
taxable income and limitations imposed by tax laws. the benefits of the nol and amt credit carryforwards have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are included in net deferred
tax assets.
u.s.
income taxes have not been recognized on $649million of the company's foreign operations' undistributed earnings as of december31, 2011, as such earnings are
intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations. furthermore, any taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits against the u.s. tax on any dividend
distributions from such earnings.

certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of deductibility. the timing of such deductibility would not affect the annual effective tax rate.
the
company recognizes accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes. during the years ended december31, 2011 and 2010, the company
recognized approximately $(122)million and $79million in interest, respectively. the company had approximately $48million and $170million accrued for the payment of
interest at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
the
irs is conducting an examination of the company's u.s. income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. the company does not expect any significant changes to its liability for unrecognized tax
benefits during the next twelve months.
12. share-based incentive compensation
the company has a share-based incentive compensation plan, the travelers companies,inc. amended and restated 2004 stock incentive plan (the 2004 incentive plan), which replaced
prior share-based incentive compensation plans (legacy plans). the purposes of the 2004 incentive plan are to align the interests of the company's non-employee directors, executive
officers and other
employees with those of the company's shareholders, and to attract and retain personnel by providing incentives in the form of stock-based awards. the 2004 incentive plan permits grants of
nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock, deferred stock units, performance awards and other stock-based
or stock-denominated awards with respect to the company's common stock. the number of shares of the company's common stock authorized for grant under the 2004 incentive plan is 35million
shares, subject to additional shares that may be available for awards as described below. the company has a policy of issuing new shares to settle the exercise of stock option awards and the vesting
of other equity awards.
in
connection with the adoption of the 2004 incentive plan, legacy share-based incentive compensation plans were terminated. outstanding grants were not affected by the termination of
these legacy plans, including the grant of reload options related to prior option grants under the legacy plans. all outstanding options with a reload feature expire in 2013.
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
12. share-based incentive compensation (continued)
the 2004 incentive plan is the only plan pursuant to which future stock-based awards may be granted. in addition to the 35million shares initially authorized for issuance under
the 2004 incentive plan, the following will not be counted towards the 35million shares available and will be available for future grants under the 2004 incentive plan: (i)shares of
common stock subject to an award that expires unexercised, that is forfeited, terminated or canceled, that is settled in cash or other forms of property,
or otherwise does not result in the issuance of shares of common stock, in whole or in part; (ii)shares that are used to pay the exercise price of stock options and shares used to pay
withholding taxes on awards generally; and (iii)shares purchased by the company on the open market using cash option exercise proceeds; provided, however, that the increase in the number of
shares of common stock available for grant pursuant to such market purchases shall not be greater than the number that could be repurchased at fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock
option giving rise to such option proceeds. these provisions also apply to awards granted under the legacy share-based incentive compensation plans that were outstanding on the effective date of the
2004 incentive plan.
the
company also has a compensation program for non-employee directors (the director compensation program). under the director compensation program, non-employee
directors' compensation consists of an annual retainer, a deferred stock award, committee chair fees and a lead director fee. each non-employee director may choose to receive all or a
portion of his or her annual retainer in the form of cash or deferred stock units which vest upon grant. the annual deferred stock awards vest in full one day prior to the date of the company's annual
meeting of shareholders occurring in the year following the year of the grant date, subject to continued service. any of the deferred stock awards may accumulate, including reinvestment dividends,
until distribution either in a lump sum six months after termination of service as a director or, if the director so elects, in annual installments beginning at least six months following termination
of service as a director. the shares of deferred stock units issued under the director compensation program are awarded under the 2004 incentive plan.
stock option awards
stock option awards granted to eligible officers and key employees have a ten-year term. prior to january1, 2007,
stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the company's common stock on the day preceding the date of grant. beginning january1, 2007, all stock
options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant. the stock options granted generally vest upon meeting certain years of service
criteria. except as the compensation committee of the board may allow in the future, stock options cannot be sold or transferred by the participant. the stock options granted under the 2004 incentive
plan vest three years after grant date (cliff vest).
in
addition to the stock option awards described above, certain stock option awards that were granted under legacy plans permit an employee exercising an option to be granted a new
option (a reload option) at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date on which the original option is exercised. the reload option is permitted on certain
stock option awards granted prior to january 2003 at an amount equal to the number of shares of the common stock used to satisfy both the exercise price and withholding taxes due upon exercise of an
option and vest either six months or one year after the grant date and are exercisable for the remaining term of the related original option.
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
12. share-based incentive compensation (continued)
the
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant by application of a variation of the black-scholes option pricing model using the assumptions noted in the following
table. the expected term of newly granted stock options is the time to vest plus half the remaining time to expiration. this considers the vesting restriction and represents an even pattern of
exercise behavior over the remaining term. reload options are exercisable for the remaining term of the original option and therefore would generally have a shorter expected term. beginning in april
2010, due to the company having attained sufficient history with respect to changes in its stock prices over time, the expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the
company's common stock for the same period as the estimated option term based on the mid-month of the option grant. prior to april 2010, the expected volatility was based on the average
historical volatility of the common stock of an industry peer group of entities due to the limited company stock history. the expected dividend is based upon the company's current quarter dividend
annualized and assumed to be constant over the expected option term. the risk-free interest rate for each option is the interpolated market yield for the mid-month of the
option grant on a u.s. treasury bill with a term comparable to the expected option term of the granted stock option. shares received through option exercises under the reload program are subject to
either a one-year or two-year restriction on sale. a discount, as measured by the estimated cost of protecting against changes in market value, 5% for one year sales
restrictions and 10% for two year sales restrictions, has been applied to the fair value of reload options granted to reflect these sales restrictions. the following assumptions were used in
estimating the fair value of options on grant date for the years ended december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock and performance share award programs
the company, commencing with equity grants on or after january1, 2007, issues restricted stock unit awards to eligible officers

from the date of grant, do not have voting rights and the underlying shares of common stock are not issued until the vesting criteria is satisfied.
the
company also has a performance share awards program pursuant to the 2004 incentive plan which became effective beginning in 2006. under the program, the company may issue performance
share awards to certain employees of the company who hold positions of vice president (or its equivalent) or above. the performance awards provide the recipient the right to earn shares of the
company's common stock based upon the company's attainment of certain performance goals. the performance goals for performance awards are based on the company's adjusted return on equity over a
three-year performance period. vesting of any performance shares is contingent upon the company attaining the relevant performance period minimum threshold return on equity. if the
performance period return on equity is below the minimum threshold, none of the shares will vest. if performance meets or exceeds the minimum performance threshold, a range of performance shares will
vest (50%160% for awards granted prior to and including february 2009; 50%150% for awards granted in february 2010; 50%130% for awards granted in february 2011
and 50%130% for awards granted in february 2012), depending on the actual return on equity attained.
the
fair value of restricted stock units, deferred stock and performance shares is measured at the market price of the company stock at date of grant.
the
total fair value of shares that vested during the years ended december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $121million, $113million and $78million,
respectively.

on
february7, 2012, the company, under the 2004 stock incentive plan, granted 1,556,874 common stock awards in the form of restricted stock units, deferred stock and performance
share

awards
to participating officers, non-employee directors and other key employees. the restricted stock units and deferred stock awards totaled 882,764 shares while the performance share
awards totaled 674,110 shares. the fair value per share attributable to the common stock awards on the date of grant was $59.74.
share-based compensation cost recognition
the amount of compensation cost for awards subject to a service condition is based on the number of shares expected to be issued and is
recognized over the time period for which service is to be provided (requisite service period). awards granted to retiree-eligible employees or to employees who become retiree-eligible before an
award's vesting date are considered to have met the requisite service condition. the compensation cost for awards subject to a performance condition is based upon the probable outcome of the
performance condition, which on the grant date reflects an estimate of attaining 100% of the performance shares granted. the compensation cost reflects an estimated annual forfeiture rate from 3.5% to
4% over the requisite service period of the awards. that estimate is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments expected to vest is likely to differ from
previous estimates. compensation costs for awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. for awards that have a graded vesting schedule, the
compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple
awards. the total compensation cost for all share-based incentive compensation awards recognized in earnings for the years ended december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $121million,
$128million and $127million, respectively. included in these amounts are compensation cost adjustments of $4million, $10million and $11million, for the years
ended december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, that reflected the cost associated with the updated estimate of performance shares due to attaining certain performance levels from the
date of the initial grant of the performance awards. the related tax benefits recognized in earnings were $42million, $44million and $44million for the years ended
december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
at
december31, 2011, there was $114million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested share-based incentive compensation awards. this includes stock
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock and performance shares granted under the company's 2004 incentive plan. the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7years.
cash
received from the exercise of employee stock options under share-based compensation plans totaled $314million and $408million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. the tax
benefit realized for tax deductions from employee stock options exercised during 2011 and 2010 totaled $30million and $28million, respectively.
13. pension plans, retirement benefits and savings plans
the company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, which covers substantially all employees and provides benefits under a cash balance formula,
except that employees satisfying certain age and service requirements remain covered by a prior final average pay formula. in addition, the company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan
which covers certain

the
total accumulated benefit obligation for the company's defined benefit pension plans was $2.83billion and $2.54billion at december31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. the qualified domestic plan accounted for $2.65billion and $2.37billion of the total accumulated benefit obligation at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively,
whereas the nonqualified and foreign plans accounted for $0.18billion and $0.17billion of the total accumulated benefit obligation at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
for
pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, the aggregate projected benefit obligation was $2.88billion and the aggregate accumulated
benefit obligation was $2.82billion at december31, 2011. the fair value of plan assets for the above plans was $2.49billion and $2.42billion at december31, 2011
and 2010, respectively.
the
company has discretion regarding whether to provide additional funding and when to provide such funding to its qualified pension plan. in 2011 and 2010, the company voluntarily made
contributions totaling $185million and $35million, respectively, to the qualified pension plan. the company has not determined whether or not additional funding will be made during
2012. there is no required contribution to the qualified pension plan during 2012.

the
discount rate assumption used to determine the benefit obligation was based on a yield-curve approach. under this approach, a weighted average yield is determined from a hypothetical
portfolio of high quality fixed maturity corporate bonds (rated aa or higher) available at the year-end valuation date for which the timing and amount of cash outflows correspond with the
timing and amount of the estimated benefit payouts of the company's benefit plan.
in
choosing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company's pension plan investment committee considered the historical returns of equity and fixed
maturity markets in conjunction with prevailing economic and financial market conditions.
as
an indicator of sensitivity, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $25million at
december31, 2011, and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense by $1million for the year ended december31, 2011.
decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december31, 2011 by
$21million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense by $1million for the year ended december31, 2011.
plan assets
pension plan assets are invested for the exclusive benefit of the plan participants and beneficiaries and are intended, over time, to
satisfy the benefit obligations under the plan. risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial position. the asset mix guidelines
have been established and are reviewed quarterly. these guidelines are intended to serve as tools to facilitate the investment of plan assets to maximize long-term total return and the
ongoing oversight of the plan's investment performance. investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through daily and monthly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability
measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.
the
company's overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit
payments with a wide
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
13. pension plans, retirement benefits and savings plans (continued)
diversification
of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. the current target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the
remainder allocated to short-term securities. equity securities primarily include investments in large, medium and small-cap companies primarily located in the united states.
fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, u.s. treasury securities and debt securities issued by foreign governments. other
investments include a hedge fund and two private equity funds held by the company's qualified defined benefit pension plan. the hedge fund is a "fund of funds" that is multi-strategy. one private
equity fund is focused on financial companies, and the other is focused on real estate-related investments.
at
december31, 2010, equity securities included 797,600 shares of the company's common stock with a market value of $44million. in january 2011, the company purchased
these shares from the pension plan under the company's share repurchase authorization for a total cost of approximately $45million, the market value on that date.
fair value measurementpension plans and other postretirement benefit assets
for a discussion of the methods employed by the company to measure the fair value of invested assets, see note4. the following
discussion of fair value measurements applies exclusively to the company's pension plans and other postretirement benefit assets.
fair
value estimates for equity and bond mutual funds held by the pension plans reflect prices received from an external pricing service that are based on observable market transactions.
these estimates are included in level1.
short-term
securities are carried at fair value which approximates cost plus accrued interest or amortized discount. the fair value or market value of these is periodically
compared to this amortized cost and is based on significant observable inputs as determined by an external pricing service. accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such short-term
securities, other than u.s. treasury securities and money market mutual funds, provided by an external pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. the
estimated fair value of u.s. treasury securities and money market mutual funds is included in the amount disclosed in level1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.

savings plan
the company has a savings plan, the travelers 401(k) savings plan (the savings plan), in which substantially all company employees are
eligible to participate. under the savings plan, the company matches employee contributions up to 5% of eligible pay, with a maximum annual match of $5,000 which becomes 100% vested after three years
of service. for the year ended december31, 2011, existing employees whose annual base salary on december31, 2010 was $175,000 or
more, and employees hired during 2011 at an annual base salary of $175,000 or more, were not eligible for the company's matching contribution. the company's matching contribution is made in cash and
invested according to the employee's current investment elections. the company's matching contribution can be reinvested at any time into any other investment option. the total expense related to the
savings plan was $89million, $93million and $98million for the years ended december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
included
in the savings plan are a legacy savings plus plan (spp) and a stock ownership plan (sop) in which substantially all employees who were hired by legacy spc before
april1, 2004 were eligible to participate. in 2004 under the spp, the company matched 100% of employees' contributions up to a maximum of 6% of their salary. the match was in the form of
preferred shares, to the extent available in the sop, or in the company's common shares. also allocated to participants were preferred shares equal to the value of dividends on previously allocated
shares. each share of preferred stock paid a dividend of $11.72 annually and was convertible into eight shares of the company's common stock. the sop has no preferred shares available for future
allocations. as described in more detail in note9 above, all preferred shares outstanding on june7, 2011 (190,083 shares) were converted into a total of 1.52million shares of
the company's common stock.
all
common shares held by the savings plan are considered outstanding for diluted eps computations and dividends paid on all shares are charged to retained earnings.
14. leases
rent expense was $191million, $206million and $211million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

contingencies
this section describes the major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which
the company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the company's properties is subject.
asbestos- and environmental-related proceedings
in the ordinary course of its insurance business, the company receives claims for insurance arising under policies issued by the
company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage
litigation, including, among others, the litigation described below. the company is defending asbestos-and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses;
however, the outcomes of these disputes are uncertain. in this regard, the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss
exposure, including settling litigation under appropriate circumstances.
asbestos direct action litigationin october 2001 and april 2002, two purported class action suits (wise v.
travelers and meninger v. travelers) were filed against travelers property casualty corp. (tpc) and other insurers (not
including the st.paul companies,inc. (spc)) in state court in west virginia. these and other cases subsequently filed in west virginia were consolidated into a single proceeding in the
circuit court of kanawha county, west virginia. the plaintiffs allege that the insurer defendants engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of state statutes by inappropriately handling and
settling asbestos claims. the plaintiffs seek to reopen large numbers of settled asbestos claims and to impose liability for damages, including punitive damages, directly on insurers. similar lawsuits
alleging inappropriate handling and settling of asbestos claims were filed in massachusetts and hawaii state courts. these suits are collectively referred to as the statutory and hawaii actions.
in
march 2002, the plaintiffs in consolidated asbestos actions pending before a mass tort panel of judges in west virginia state court amended their complaint to include tpc as a
defendant, alleging that tpc and other insurers breached alleged duties to certain users of asbestos products. the plaintiffs seek damages, including punitive damages. lawsuits seeking similar relief
and raising similar allegations, primarily violations of purported common law duties to third parties, have also been asserted in various state courts against tpc and spc. the claims asserted in these
suits are collectively referred to as the common law claims.
the
federal bankruptcy court that had presided over the bankruptcy of tpc's former policyholder johns-manville corporation issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the prosecution of
the statutory actions (but not the hawaii actions), the common law claims and an additional set of cases filed in various state courts in texas and ohio, and enjoining certain attorneys from filing
any further lawsuits against tpc based on similar allegations. notwithstanding the injunction, additional common law claims were filed against tpc.

in
november 2003, the parties reached a settlement of the statutory and hawaii actions. this settlement includes a lump-sum payment of up to $412million by tpc,
subject to a number of significant contingencies. in may 2004, the parties reached a settlement resolving substantially all pending and similar future common law claims against tpc. this settlement
requires a payment of up to $90million by tpc, subject to a number of significant contingencies. among the
contingencies for each of these settlements is a final order of the bankruptcy court clarifying that all of these claims, and similar future asbestos-related claims against tpc, are barred by prior
orders entered by the bankruptcy court ("the 1986 orders").
on
august17, 2004, the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the settlements and clarifying that the 1986 orders barred the pending statutory and hawaii actions and
substantially all common law claims pending against tpc ("the clarifying order"). the clarifying order also applies to similar direct action claims that may be filed in the future.
on
march29, 2006, the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york substantially affirmed the clarifying order while vacating that portion of the order that required
all future direct actions against tpc to first be approved by the bankruptcy court before proceeding in state or federal court.
various
parties appealed the district court's march29, 2006 ruling to the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit. on february15, 2008, the second circuit issued an
opinion vacating on jurisdictional grounds the district court's approval of the clarifying order. on february29, 2008, tpc and certain other parties to the appeals filed petitions for
rehearing and/or rehearing en banc, requesting reinstatement of the district court's judgment, which were denied. tpc and certain other parties filed
petitions for writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking review of the second circuit's decision, and on december12, 2008, the petitions were granted.
on
june18, 2009, the supreme court ruled in favor of tpc, reversing the second circuit's february15, 2008 decision, finding, among other things, that the 1986 orders are
final and generally bar the statutory and hawaii actions and substantially all common law claims against tpc. further, the supreme court ruled that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to issue the
clarifying order. however, since the second circuit had not ruled on certain additional issues, principally related to procedural matters and the adequacy of notice provided to certain parties, the
supreme court remanded the case to the second circuit for further proceedings on those specific issues. on october21, 2009, all but one of the objectors to the clarifying order requested that
the second circuit dismiss their appeal of the order approving the settlement, and that request was granted.
on
march22, 2010, the second circuit issued an opinion in which it found that the notice of the 1986 orders provided to the remaining objector was insufficient to bar
contribution claims by that objector against tpc. on april5, 2010, tpc filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc with the second
circuit, requesting further review of its march22, 2010 opinion, which was denied on may25, 2010. on august18, 2010, tpc filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the united
states supreme court seeking review of the second circuit's march22, 2010 opinion, and a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking an order from the supreme court requiring the second circuit to
comply with the supreme court's june18, 2009 ruling in tpc's favor. the supreme court denied the petitions on november29, 2010.

the
plaintiffs in the statutory and hawaii actions and the common law claims actions filed motions to compel with the bankruptcy court on september2, 2010 and september3,
2010, respectively, arguing that all conditions precedent to the settlements have been met and seeking to require tpc to pay the settlement amounts. on september30, 2010, tpc filed an
opposition to the plaintiffs' motions to compel on the grounds that the conditions precedent to the settlements, principally the requirement that all contribution claims be barred, have not been met
in light of the second circuit's march22, 2010 opinion. on december16, 2010, the bankruptcy court granted the plaintiffs' motions and ruled that tpc was required to fund the
settlements. on january20, 2011, the bankruptcy court entered judgment in accordance with its december16, 2010 ruling and ordered tpc to pay the settlement amounts plus prejudgment
interest. on january21, 2011, tpc filed an appeal with the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york from the bankruptcy court's january20, 2011 judgment. on
january24, 2011, certain of the plaintiffs in the common law claims actions appealed that portion of the bankruptcy court's january20, 2011 judgment that denied their request for an
order of contempt and for sanctions. oral argument on the appeals took place on january9, 2012, and the parties await the court's decision.
spc,
which is not covered by the manville bankruptcy court rulings or the settlements described above, is a party to pending direct action cases in texas state court asserting common law
claims. all such cases that are still pending and in which spc has been served are currently on the inactive docket in texas state court. if any of those cases becomes active, spc intends to litigate
those cases vigorously. spc was previously a defendant in similar direct actions in ohio state court. those actions have all been dismissed following favorable rulings by ohio trial and appellate
courts. from time to time, spc and/or its subsidiaries have been named in individual direct actions in other jurisdictions.
outcome and impact of asbestos and environmental claims and litigation.currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and
their impact on
the future development of claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. any such development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes
in applicable legislation. because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, the company's estimate of ultimate
claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement
charges that could be material to the company's results of operations in future periods.
other proceedings not arising under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements
broker anti-trust litigationin 2005, four putative class action lawsuits were brought against a number of insurance brokers and insurers,
including the company, by plaintiffs who allegedly purchased insurance products through one or more of the defendant brokers. the plaintiffs alleged that various insurance brokers conspired with each
other and with various insurers, including the company, to artificially inflate premiums, allocate brokerage customers and rig bids for insurance products offered to those customers. to the extent
they were not originally filed there, the federal class actions were transferred to the u.s. district court for the district of new jersey and were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings
with other class actions under the caption in re insurance brokerage antitrust litigation. on august1, 2005, various plaintiffs, including the
four named plaintiffs in the above-referenced class actions, filed an amended consolidated class action complaint naming various brokers

and
insurers, including the company, on behalf of a putative nationwide class of policyholders. the complaint included causes of action under the sherman act, the racketeer influenced and corrupt
organizations act (rico), state common law and the laws of the various states prohibiting antitrust violations. the complaint sought monetary damages, including punitive damages and trebled damages,
permanent injunctive relief, restitution, including disgorgement of profits, interest and costs, including attorneys' fees. all defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.
after giving plaintiffs multiple opportunities to replead, the court dismissed the sherman act claims on august31, 2007 and the rico claims on september28, 2007, both with prejudice,
and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. the plaintiffs appealed the district court's decisions to the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit. on
august16, 2010, the third circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of all sherman act and rico claims against certain defendants, including the company, except for sherman act and rico
claims involving the sale of excess casualty insurance through a single defendant broker, as well as all state law claims, which they remanded to the district court for further proceedings. on
october1, 2010, defendants, including the company, filed renewed motions to dismiss the remanded claims. on march18, 2011, the company and certain other defendants entered into an
agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. the settlement, under which the company agreed to pay $6.75million, is subject to court approval. preliminary approval of the settlement
was granted on june27, 2011. on september14, 2011, the court conducted a final fairness hearing and the settling parties await the court's decision.
otherin addition to those described above, the company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages relating
to insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements. based upon currently available information, the company does not believe it is
reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the company's results of operations or have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position or
liquidity.
gain contingencies
on august20, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in new york state court captioned united states
fidelity& guaranty company v. american re-insurance company, et al., the trial court granted summary judgment for united states fidelity and guaranty
company (usf&g), a subsidiary of the company, and on october25, 2010, entered judgment against american re-insurance company, a subsidiary of munich re (american re) and three
other reinsurers, awarding usf&g $251million plus pre-judgment interest in the amount of $169million. the judgment, including the award of interest, was appealed to the new
york supreme court, appellate division, first department. on january24, 2012, the appellate division affirmed the judgment, which, as of that date, totaled $467million, comprising the
judgment of $251million and interest of $216million (including post-judgment interest). post-judgment interest continues to accrue (without compounding) at the rate of 9%
until the judgment is paid. on january30, 2012, the reinsurers filed a motion with the appellate division seeking permission to appeal its decision to the new york court of appeals. whether
the appellate division grants permission to appeal is within its discretion. the $251million awarded by the court represents the amount owed to usf&g under the terms of the disputed
reinsurance agreements and is reported as part of reinsurance recoverables in the company's consolidated balance sheet. the interest awarded by the court, including post-judgment interest,
is treated for accounting purposes as a gain contingency

in
accordance with fasb topic 450, contingencies, and accordingly has not been recognized in the company's consolidated financial statements.
in
an unrelated action, the travelers indemnity company is one of the settlement class plaintiffs and a class member in a class action lawsuit captioned safeco
insurance company of america, et al. v. american international group,inc. et al. (u.s. district court, n.d. ill.) in which the defendants are alleged to have engaged in
the under-reporting of workers' compensation premium in connection with a workers' compensation reinsurance pool in which several subsidiaries of the company participate. on
july26, 2011, the court granted preliminary approval of a class settlement pursuant to which the defendants agreed to pay $450million to the class. the settlement includes a plan of
allocation of the settlement proceeds among the class members. on december21, 2011, the court entered an order granting final approval of the settlement. on january19, 2012, three
parties who objected to the settlement filed notices of appeal from the court's orders approving the settlement with the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit. the company anticipates that its
allocation from the settlement fund, in the event the court's approval of the class settlement is affirmed, will be approximately $90million. this amount is treated for accounting purposes as
a gain contingency in accordance with fasb topic 450, contingencies, and accordingly has not been recognized in the company's consolidated financial
statements.
other commitments and guarantees
commitments
investment commitmentsthe company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships in which it invests.
these commitments totaled $1.15billion and $1.26billion at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
guarantees
the company has contingent obligations for guarantees related to certain investments, third-party loans related to certain investments,
certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries, and various other indemnifications, including those related to the sale of business entities. the company also provides standard
indemnifications to service providers in the normal course of business. the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications have no
stated or notional amounts or limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and, accordingly, the company is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential payments for such
arrangements. the maximum amount of the company's obligation for guarantees of certain investments and third-party loans related to certain investments
that are quantifiable was $126million at december31, 2011, approximately $63million of which is indemnified by a third party. the maximum amount of the company's obligation
related to the guarantee of certain insurance policy obligations of a former insurance subsidiary was $480million at december31, 2011, all of which is indemnified by a third party.
in
the ordinary course of selling business entities to third parties, the company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of representations and warranties
with respect to the business entities being sold, covenants and obligations of the company and/or its subsidiaries following the closing, and in certain cases obligations arising from undisclosed
liabilities, adverse reserve development, imposition of additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse

interpretation
of the tax law, or certain named litigation. such indemnification provisions generally survive for periods ranging from seven years following the applicable closing date to the
expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations, although, in some cases, there may be other agreed upon term limitations or no term limitations. certain of these contingent obligations are subject
to deductibles which have to be incurred by the obligee before the company is obligated to make payments. the maximum amount of the company's contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the
sale of business entities that are quantifiable was $1.22billion at december31, 2011, of which $9million was recognized on the balance sheet at that date.
16. noncash investing and financing activities
there were no material noncash financing or investing activities during the years ended december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
17. consolidating financial statements of the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries

not applicable.
item9a.controls and procedures
the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in rules13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (exchange act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company's reports under the
exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission's rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. the
company's management, with the participation of the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company's
disclosure controls and procedures as of december31, 2011. based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded
that, as of december31, 2011, the design and operation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.
in
addition, there was no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the exchange act) that occurred during the quarter ended december31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over
financial reporting.
table of contents
management's report on internal control over financial reporting
management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the
company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements of the company in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the company's accounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained
by management, are under the general oversight of the company's audit committee.
the
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company's management and directors; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management
has assessed the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2011. the standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are
the measures in the internal controlintegrated framework published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
based
upon its assessment, management has concluded that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at december31, 2011, and that there were no
material weaknesses in the company's internal control over financial reporting as of that date.
kpmgllp,
an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this form10-k,
has issued its report on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting which follows this report.

report of independent registered public accounting firm
the
board of directors and stockholders
the travelers companies,inc.:
we
have audited the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries' (the company) internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2011, based on criteria
established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso).
the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.
we
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in
our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2011, based on criteria established in  internal controlintegrated
framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
we
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheet of the travelers
companies,inc. and subsidiaries as of december31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended december31, 2011, and our report dated february16, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december31,

schedules as listed in the accompanying index. these financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statement schedules based on our audits.
in
our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein.
as
discussed in note1 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed its method of accounting for other-than-temporary impairments of debt
securities as of april1, 2009 due to the adoption of new fasb guidance.

the travelers companies,inc.  (parent company only)         notes to the condensed financial information of registrant
1.other revenues
in 2010, other revenues included $60million of expenses related to the company's purchase and retirement of $885million of its $1.0billion
6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures.
2.guarantees
the travelers companies,inc. (trv) has contingent obligations for guarantees related to its subsidiary's debt obligations and various other
indemnifications, including those related to the sale of business entities. trv also provides standard indemnifications to service providers in the normal course of business. the indemnification
clauses are often standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications have no stated or notional amounts or limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and,
accordingly, trv is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential payments for such arrangements.
in
the ordinary course of selling business entities to third parties, trv has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of representations and warranties with
respect to the business entities being sold, covenants and obligations of trv and/or its subsidiaries following the closing, and in certain cases obligations arising from undisclosed liabilities,
adverse reserve development, imposition of additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law, or certain named litigation. such indemnification
provisions generally survive for periods ranging from eight years following the applicable closing date to the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations, although, in some cases, there may be
other agreed upon term limitations or no term limitations. certain of these contingent obligations are subject to deductibles which have to be incurred by the obligee before trv is obligated to make
payments. the maximum amount of trv's contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of business entities that are quantifiable was $93million at december31, 2011, of
which $9million was recognized on the balance sheet at that date.
trv
has fully and unconditionally guaranteed certain debt obligations of tpc, its wholly-owned subsidiary, which totaled $1.20billion at december31, 2011. prior to the
merger of tpc and spc in 2004, tpc fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of all principal, premiums, if any, and interest on certain debt obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiary tighi.
trv has fully and
unconditionally guaranteed such guarantee obligations of tpc. see note17 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
