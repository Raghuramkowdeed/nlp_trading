THE GROWTH IN PRETAX INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2000 WAS

CENTERED IN OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO A $330 MILLION INCREASE IN REALIZED INVESTMENT

GAINS AND IMPROVED UNDERWRITING RESULTS IN SEVERAL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS.  PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING RESULTS IN BOTH 2000 AND

1999 BENEFITED FROM THE AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE

TREATIES DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL ON PAGE 10 OF THIS REPORT. IN

ADDITION, AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES,

DURING WHICH PRICING LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INDUSTRY FAILED TO KEEP PACE WITH RISING LOSS COSTS, THE PRICING

ENVIRONMENT IMPROVED IN NEARLY ALL MARKET SECTORS IN 2000,

CONTRIBUTING TO OUR IMPROVEMENT OVER 1999.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

THE REINSURANCE TREATIES IN BOTH YEARS REFERRED TO ABOVE, OUR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2000 TOTALED $6.36

BILLION, NEARLY $1 BILLION HIGHER THAN COMPARABLE 1999 VOLUME OF

$5.38 BILLION.

MAJOR 2000 TRANSACTIONS.  IN APRIL 2000, WE COMPLETED OUR

ACQUISITION OF MMI COMPANIES, INC. ("MMI"), AN INTERNATIONAL HEALTH

CARE RISK SERVICES COMPANY, FOR A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $206

MILLION IN CASH AND THE ASSUMPTION OF $165 MILLION OF MMI DEBT AND

CAPITAL SECURITIES.  IN FEBRUARY 2000, WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION

OF PACIFIC SELECT INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC. ("PACIFIC SELECT"), A

CALIFORNIA COMPANY THAT PROVIDES EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE COVERAGES TO

HOMEOWNERS IN THAT STATE, FOR A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $37

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

IN MAY 2000, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR NONSTANDARD AUTO

INSURANCE OPERATIONS PRIOR TO CLOSING).  NOTE 14 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 68 AND 69 OF OUR 2000

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT

THIS SALE AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

IN 2000, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED APPROXIMATELY 18 MILLION OF OUR

COMMON SHARES FOR A TOTAL COST OF $536 MILLION.  THE SHARES

REPURCHASED REPRESENTED 8% OF OUR TOTAL SHARES OUTSTANDING AT THE

BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.  THE REPURCHASES WERE FINANCED THROUGH A

COMBINATION OF INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND THE ISSUANCE OF NEW

DEBT.

ALSO IN 2000, OUR SUBSIDIARY, ST. PAUL CAPITAL LLC, EXERCISED ITS

RIGHT TO CAUSE THE CONVERSION RIGHTS OF THE OWNERS OF ITS $207

MILLION, 6% CONVERTIBLE MONTHLY INCOME PREFERRED SECURITIES (MIPS)

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE

OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OPERATIONS CONSIST OF FIVE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS THAT UNDERWRITE PRIMARY INSURANCE ("PRIMARY

INSURANCE OPERATIONS"), A REINSURANCE SEGMENT ("ST. PAUL RE"), AND

AN INVESTMENT SEGMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING AND OVERSEEING

OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  OUR PRIMARY INSURANCE

OPERATIONS UNDERWRITE PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE AND PROVIDE

INSURANCE-RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL AND

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND IN SELECTED

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR LARGEST PRIMARY

INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY IS ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE

INSURANCE COMPANY ("FIRE AND MARINE").  THREE OF THE FIVE BUSINESS

SEGMENTS IN OUR PRIMARY INSURANCE OPERATIONS COMPRISE OUR GLOBAL

SPECIALTY PRACTICES ORGANIZATION, WHICH UNDERWRITES SPECIALTY

COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COVERAGES ON A GLOBAL BASIS.

THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF PROPERTY-LIABILITY REVENUES ARE PREMIUMS

EARNED FROM INSURANCE POLICIES AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS, INCOME

EARNED FROM THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND GAINS FROM SALES OF

INVESTMENTS.  ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS

PUBLISHED IN "BEST'S REVIEW" WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURERS DOING BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR PROPERTY-

LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS RANKED 14TH ON THE BASIS OF 1999

WRITTEN PREMIUMS.

PRINCIPAL DEPARTMENTS AND PRODUCTS.  THE "PROPERTY-LIABILITY

UNDERWRITING RESULTS BY SEGMENT" TABLE INCLUDED IN "MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" ON PAGE 25 OF OUR 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH SUMMARIZES WRITTEN PREMIUMS, UNDERWRITING

RESULTS AND STATUTORY COMBINED RATIOS FOR EACH OF OUR UNDERWRITING

SEGMENTS FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION

ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF, AND PRODUCTS OFFERED BY, OUR PROPERTY-

LIABILITY INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS.

PRIMARY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

----------------------------

OUR PRIMARY INSURANCE OPERATIONS CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING FIVE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

COMMERCIAL LINES GROUP.  THE COMMERCIAL LINES GROUP, IN GENERAL,

UNDERWRITES GENERAL LIABILITY AND CASUALTY, PROPERTY, WORKERS'

COMPENSATION, COMMERCIAL AUTO, INLAND MARINE, UMBRELLA AND EXCESS

LIABILITY, AND PACKAGE COVERAGES IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS

SEGMENT INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS CENTERS: MIDDLE MARKET

COMMERCIAL PROVIDES "ALL LINES" PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE

AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR MIDSIZE AND LARGE COMMERCIAL

ENTERPRISES THAT GENERALLY HAVE LESS THAN $500 MILLION IN TOTAL

REVENUES.  TAILORED COVERAGES AND PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED TO SPECIFIC

CUSTOMER GROUPS SUCH AS GOLF FACILITIES, MUSEUMS, COLLEGES AND

SCHOOLS, MULTIPURPOSE RECREATIONAL FACILITIES, MANUFACTURERS,

WHOLESALERS, PROCESSORS AND SERVICE-RELATED INDUSTRIES (RETAILERS,

INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND HOSPITALITY AND ENTERTAINMENT FIRMS).

SMALL COMMERCIAL PROVIDES COVERAGES TO SMALL BUSINESSES, INCLUDING

RETAILERS, WHOLESALERS, PROFESSIONAL OFFICES, MANUFACTURERS AND

CONTRACTORS. THE MIDDLE MARKET COMMERCIAL AND SMALL COMMERCIAL

BUSINESS CENTERS ALSO BOTH OFFER UNIQUE COVERAGES FOR GROUP

ACCOUNTS, SUCH AS FRANCHISE OPERATIONS, ASSOCIATIONS AND MULTI-

LOCATION ACCOUNTS.

OUR TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS CENTER MARKETS PROPERTY AND LIABILITY

COVERAGES AND RISK CONTROL SERVICES TO THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY.  THE

LARGE ACCOUNTS BUSINESS CENTER SERVES LARGE COMMERCIAL ENTITIES

WITH REVENUES IN EXCESS OF $500 MILLION, OFFERING COMPREHENSIVE

GLOBAL PROGRAMS INCLUDING LARGE DEDUCTIBLES, SELF-INSURED

RETENTIONS, AND RETROSPECTIVE RATING PLANS.  THE NATIONAL PROGRAMS

BUSINESS CENTER UNDERWRITES INSURANCE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NATIONAL IN

SCOPE AND MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA, INCLUDING PREMIUM VOLUME AND

PROFITABILITY POTENTIAL.

THE CATASTROPHE RISK BUSINESS CENTER UNDERWRITES PROPERTY COVERAGE

PACIFIC SELECT IN FEBRUARY 2000 EXPANDED OUR INVOLVEMENT IN

CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE COVERAGES.

OUR PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH

PROVIDE SPECIALIZED UNDERWRITING SKILLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

SERVICES FOR THE CLASSES OF BUSINESS THAT THEY WRITE, IS ALSO

INCLUDED IN COMMERCIAL LINES GROUP RESULTS.  THESE POOLS AND

ASSOCIATIONS SERVE TO INCREASE THE UNDERWRITING CAPACITY OF

PARTICIPATING COMPANIES FOR INSURANCE POLICIES WHERE THE

CONCENTRATION OF RISK IS SO HIGH OR THE AMOUNT SO LARGE THAT A

SINGLE COMPANY COULD NOT PRUDENTLY ACCEPT THE ENTIRE RISK.  WE

LIMIT OUR PARTICIPATION IN THESE POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS.

GLOBAL HEALTHCARE.  OUR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE SEGMENT IS ONE COMPONENT

OF OUR GLOBAL SPECIALTY PRACTICES ORGANIZATION.  THIS SEGMENT

UNDERWRITES PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY, PROPERTY AND GENERAL LIABILITY

INSURANCE THROUGHOUT THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE UNITED

STATES AND IN SELECTED INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  PRODUCTS INCLUDE

DENTAL PROFESSIONALS AND NURSES); INDIVIDUAL HEALTHCARE FACILITIES

(INCLUDING HOSPITALS, LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES AND OTHER

LOSS CONTROL SERVICES ARE VITAL COMPONENTS OF GLOBAL HEALTHCARE'S

INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  OUR HEALTHCARE SEGMENT IS ONE OF

THE LEADING MEDICAL LIABILITY INSURERS IN THE UNITED STATES.

DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, TO A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CLIENTS

SPECIALIZING IN GENERAL CONTRACTING, HIGHWAY AND BRIDGE

CONSTRUCTION, ASPHALT PAVING, UNDERGROUND AND PIPELINE

MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION.  BID BONDS PROVIDE

FINANCIAL ASSURANCE THAT A BID HAS BEEN SUBMITTED IN GOOD FAITH AND

THAT THE CONTRACTOR INTENDS TO ENTER INTO THE CONTRACT AT THE PRICE

BID AND PROVIDE THE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS.

PERFORMANCE BONDS PROTECT THE OBLIGEE FROM FINANCIAL LOSS SHOULD

THE CONTRACTOR FAIL TO PERFORM THE CONTRACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS.  PAYMENT BONDS

GUARANTEE THAT THE CONTRACTOR WILL PAY CERTAIN SUBCONTRACTOR, LABOR

AND MATERIAL BILLS ASSOCIATED WITH A PROJECT.  THE COMMERCIAL

BONDS.

DATA PUBLISHED BY AFIANZA, THE MEXICAN SURETY COMMISSION,

AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY 40% OF THE MEXICAN

SURETY BOND MARKET BASED ON ANNUAL WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2000.

GLOBAL SPECIALTY PRACTICES ORGANIZATION, IS COMPOSED OF THE

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE AND PROVIDES RELATED SERVICES TO SELF-

INSURED COMPANIES AND INSURANCE POOLS, IN ADDITION TO CEDING TO AND

REINSURING CAPTIVE INSURERS, ALL WITHIN THE ALTERNATIVE RISK

EXPECT TO PAY TO THE CLAIMANT ARE REFERRED TO AS LOSSES.  THE COSTS

OF INVESTIGATING, RESOLVING AND PROCESSING THESE CLAIMS ARE

REFERRED TO AS LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES ("LAE").  WE ESTABLISH

RESERVES THAT REFLECT THE ESTIMATED UNPAID TOTAL COST OF THESE TWO

ITEMS.  THE RESERVES FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE AT DEC. 31, 2000

COVER CLAIMS THAT WERE INCURRED NOT ONLY IN 2000 BUT ALSO IN PRIOR

YEARS.  THEY INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL COST OF CLAIMS THAT

HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPORTED BUT NOT YET SETTLED ("CASE" RESERVES),

AND THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED ("IBNR"

RESERVES).  LOSS RESERVES ARE REDUCED FOR ESTIMATES OF SALVAGE AND

SUBROGATION.

LOSS RESERVES FOR TABULAR WORKERS' COMPENSATION BUSINESS AND

CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT

VALUE.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE DISCOUNTED LIABILITIES

IS SET FORTH IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON

PAGES 51 THROUGH 54 OF OUR 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, AND

IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  DURING 2000, $7.9 MILLION OF

DISCOUNT WAS AMORTIZED AND $2.9 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT WAS

ACCRUED.

MANAGEMENT CONTINUALLY REVIEWS LOSS RESERVES, USING A VARIETY OF

STATISTICAL AND ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES TO ANALYZE CURRENT CLAIM

COSTS, FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY DATA, AND PREVAILING ECONOMIC, SOCIAL

AND LEGAL FACTORS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES CURRENTLY

ESTABLISHED FOR LOSSES AND LAE ARE ADEQUATE TO COVER THEIR EVENTUAL

COSTS.  HOWEVER, FINAL CLAIM PAYMENTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE

RESERVES, PARTICULARLY WHEN THESE PAYMENTS MAY NOT TAKE PLACE FOR

SEVERAL YEARS.  RESERVES ESTABLISHED IN PRIOR YEARS ARE ADJUSTED AS

LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED RESERVES ARE REFLECTED IN

RESULTS IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THEY ARE MADE.

TEN-YEAR DEVELOPMENT.  THE TABLE ON PAGE 9 PRESENTS A DEVELOPMENT

OF NET LOSS AND LAE RESERVE LIABILITIES AND PAYMENTS FOR THE YEARS

1990 THROUGH 2000.  THE TOP LINE ON THE TABLE SHOWS THE ESTIMATED

LIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE, NET OF REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES, RECORDED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE FOR EACH OF THE

YEARS INDICATED.

THE TABLE EXCLUDES THE RESERVES AND ACTIVITY OF ECONOMY FIRE AND

CASUALTY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ("ECONOMY"), WHICH WERE

INCLUDED IN THE SALE OF OUR STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS

TO METROPOLITAN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY

("METROPOLITAN") IN 1999.  THE TABLE DOES, HOWEVER, INCLUDE

RESERVES AND ACTIVITY FOR THE NON-ECONOMY STANDARD PERSONAL

INSURANCE BUSINESS THAT WAS SOLD TO METROPOLITAN, SINCE WE REMAIN

LIABLE FOR CLAIMS ON NON-ECONOMY STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCE

POLICIES THAT RESULT FROM LOSSES OCCURRING PRIOR TO SEPT. 30, 1999

(THE CLOSING DATE OF THE SALE).  ALSO EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ARE

THE RESERVES AND ACTIVITY FOR OUR NONSTANDARD AUTO BUSINESS, WHICH

WE SOLD TO PRUDENTIAL IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2000.  NOTES 8 AND

14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 59, AND PAGES

68 AND 69, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS,

WHICH INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE SALE OF THESE

OPERATIONS AND THE RELATED RESERVES, ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE.

IN 1997, WE CHANGED THE METHOD BY WHICH WE ASSIGN LOSS ACTIVITY TO

A PARTICULAR YEAR FOR ASSUMED REINSURANCE WRITTEN BY OUR U.K.-BASED

REINSURANCE OPERATION.  PRIOR TO 1997, THAT LOSS ACTIVITY WAS

ASSIGNED TO THE YEAR IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING REINSURANCE CONTRACT

WAS WRITTEN.  IN 1997, OUR ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT AN EXCESS AMOUNT

OF LOSS ACTIVITY WAS BEING ASSIGNED TO PRIOR YEARS BECAUSE OF THIS

PRACTICE.  AS A RESULT, WE IMPLEMENTED AN IMPROVED PROCEDURE IN

1997 THAT MORE ACCURATELY ASSIGNS LOSS ACTIVITY FOR THIS BUSINESS

TO THE YEAR IN WHICH IT OCCURRED.  THIS CHANGE HAD THE IMPACT OF

INCREASING FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT ON PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES

BY APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION IN 1997.  THERE WAS NO NET IMPACT ON

TOTAL INCURRED LOSSES, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THERE WAS A CORRESPONDING

INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CURRENT YEAR LOSS ACTIVITY IN 1997.

DEVELOPMENT DATA FOR INDIVIDUAL YEARS PRIOR TO 1997 IN THIS TABLE

WERE NOT RESTATED TO REFLECT THIS NEW PROCEDURE BECAUSE RELIABLE

DATA TO DO SO WAS NOT AVAILABLE.

THE UPPER PORTION OF THE TABLE, WHICH SHOWS THE RE-ESTIMATED

AMOUNTS RELATING TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED LIABILITIES, IS BASED

UPON EXPERIENCE AS OF THE END OF EACH SUCCEEDING YEAR.  THESE

ESTIMATES ARE EITHER INCREASED OR DECREASED AS FURTHER INFORMATION

BECOMES KNOWN ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS AND AS CHANGES IN THE TREND

OF CLAIM FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY BECOME APPARENT.

THE "CUMULATIVE REDUNDANCY" LINE ON THE TABLE FOR ANY GIVEN

YEAR REPRESENTS THE AGGREGATE CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATES FOR ALL

YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO THE YEAR THE RESERVES WERE INITIALLY

ESTABLISHED.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE 1991 RESERVE OF $12,838 MILLION

DEVELOPED TO $12,470 MILLION, OR A $368 MILLION REDUNDANCY, BY THE

END OF 1993.  BY THE END OF 2000, THE 1991 RESERVE HAD DEVELOPED A

REDUNDANCY OF $1,107 MILLION.  THE CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE OF 1991

LOSS RESERVES WERE REFLECTED IN OPERATIONS DURING THE PAST NINE

YEARS.

IN 1993, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 113, "ACCOUNTING AND

REPORTING FOR REINSURANCE OF SHORT-DURATION AND LONG-DURATION

CONTRACTS."  THIS STATEMENT REQUIRED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ON UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE BE SHOWN AS AN

ASSET, INSTEAD OF THE PRIOR PRACTICE OF NETTING THIS AMOUNT AGAINST

INSURANCE RESERVES FOR BALANCE SHEET REPORTING PURPOSES.

THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE TABLE, WHICH INCLUDES DATA FOR ONLY THOSE

PERIODS IMPACTED SINCE THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 113 (THE YEARS 1992

THROUGH 2000), REPRESENTS A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE NET RESERVE

LIABILITY AS SHOWN ON THE TOP LINE OF THE TABLE AND THE GROSS

RESERVE LIABILITY AS SHOWN ON OUR BALANCE SHEET.  THIS PORTION OF

THE TABLE ALSO PRESENTS THE GROSS RE-ESTIMATED RESERVE LIABILITY AS

OF THE END OF THE LATEST RE-ESTIMATION PERIOD (DEC. 31, 2000) AND

THE RELATED RE-ESTIMATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE.  WE DID NOT

RESTATE DATA FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 1992 IN THIS TABLE FOR PRESENTATION

ON A GROSS BASIS DUE TO THE IMPRACTICALITY OF DETERMINING SUCH

GROSS DATA ON A RELIABLE BASIS FOR OUR FOREIGN UNDERWRITING

OPERATIONS.

THE LOWER PORTION OF THE TABLE PRESENTS THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID

WITH RESPECT TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED LIABILITY AS OF THE END OF

EACH SUCCEEDING YEAR.  FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF DEC. 31, 2000, $9,343

MILLION OF THE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED $11,731 MILLION OF LOSSES AND

LAE THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED FOR THE YEARS UP TO AND INCLUDING 1991

HAVE BEEN PAID.  THUS, AS OF DEC. 31, 2000, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT

$2,388 MILLION OF INCURRED LOSSES AND LAE HAVE YET TO BE PAID FOR

THE YEARS UP TO AND INCLUDING 1991.

CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED IN EVALUATING THE INFORMATION SHOWN ON

THIS TABLE.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EACH AMOUNT INCLUDES THE

EFFECTS OF ALL CHANGES IN AMOUNTS FOR PRIOR PERIODS.  FOR EXAMPLE,

THE PORTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT SHOWN FOR YEAR-END 1995 RESERVES

THAT RELATES TO 1990 LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE

REDUNDANCY (DEFICIENCY) FOR THE YEARS 1990 THROUGH 1995.

IN ADDITION, THE TABLE PRESENTS CALENDAR YEAR DATA.  IT DOES NOT

PRESENT ACCIDENT OR POLICY YEAR DEVELOPMENT DATA, WHICH SOME

READERS MAY BE MORE ACCUSTOMED TO ANALYZING.  THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC

AND LEGAL CONDITIONS AND OTHER TRENDS WHICH HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON

THE CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN THE PAST ARE NOT

NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE FUTURE.  ACCORDINGLY, READERS ARE

CAUTIONED AGAINST EXTRAPOLATING ANY CONCLUSIONS ABOUT FUTURE

RESULTS FROM THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS TABLE.

NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON PAGE 59 OF OUR

2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF

BEGINNING AND ENDING LOSS RESERVE LIABILITIES FOR EACH OF THE LAST

THREE YEARS AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RESERVES IS CONTAINED IN THE "LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS

CLAIMS" SECTIONS OF "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" ON PAGES

CEDED REINSURANCE.  THROUGH CEDED REINSURANCE, OTHER INSURERS AND

REINSURERS AGREE TO SHARE CERTAIN RISKS THAT OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

UNDERWRITTEN.  THE PURPOSE OF REINSURANCE IS TO LIMIT A CEDING

INSURER'S MAXIMUM NET LOSS ARISING FROM LARGE RISKS OR

CATASTROPHES.  REINSURANCE ALSO SERVES TO INCREASE THE DIRECT

WRITING CAPACITY OF THE CEDING INSURER.  AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON

CEDED LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS AN ASSET.  IN ADDITION, THROUGH

AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS TREATIES, REINSURANCE CAN SERVE TO REDUCE

THE VOLATILITY OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESULTS OF PRIMARY

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE UNDERWRITING ENTITIES.

THE COLLECTIBILITY OF REINSURANCE IS SUBJECT TO THE SOLVENCY OF

REINSURERS.  OUR REINSURANCE CREDIT RISK COMMITTEE, WHICH HAS

ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL STANDARDS TO DETERMINE QUALIFIED, FINANCIALLY

SECURE REINSURERS, GUIDES THE PLACEMENT OF CEDED REINSURANCE.

UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL

PROPERTY - LIABILITY INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

OBJECTIVES.  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVES THE OVERALL INVESTMENT

PLAN FOR THE COMPANIES WITHIN THE ST. PAUL'S PROPERTY-LIABILITY

OPERATIONS.  EACH SUBSIDIARY DEVELOPS ITS OWN SPECIFIC INVESTMENT

POLICY TAILORED TO COMPLY WITH DOMESTIC LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND

THE OVERALL CORPORATE INVESTMENT PLAN.  THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF

THOSE PLANS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

1)   TO MAINTAIN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED FIXED MATURITIES PORTFOLIO

STRUCTURED TO MAXIMIZE INVESTMENT RETURNS WHILE GENERATING

SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND OPERATIONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS;

2)   TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN HIGH-QUALITY

INSTRUMENTS; AND

3)   TO PROVIDE FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ENHANCE SHAREHOLDER VALUE THROUGH

INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENT CLASSES, SUCH AS EQUITY

SECURITIES, VENTURE CAPITAL AND REAL ESTATE.

THE  FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ON EACH OF  OUR

INVESTED ASSET CLASSES.

FIXED MATURITIES.  FIXED MATURITIES CONSTITUTED 75% (AT COST) OF

OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OPERATIONS' INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

AT DEC. 31, 2000.  THE PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF HIGH-

QUALITY, INTERMEDIATE-TERM TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND

CORPORATE BONDS AND TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS.  THE TABLE ON

THE FOLLOWING PAGE PRESENTS INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIXED MATURITIES

PORTFOLIO FOR THE YEARS 1998 THROUGH 2000 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS).

WE DETERMINE THE MIX OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT

SECURITIES BASED ON OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED TAX POSITION AND THE

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENT YIELDS AT

THE TIME OF PURCHASE.  TAXABLE, INTERMEDIATE-TERM, INVESTMENT-GRADE

SECURITIES ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF NEW BOND PURCHASES IN EACH

OF THE YEARS 2000, 1999 AND 1998.  WE CARRY THE FIXED MATURITIES

PORTFOLIO ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, WITH

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION AND DEPRECIATION (NET OF TAXES) RECORDED IN

COMMON SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY.

THE FIXED MATURITIES PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED CONSERVATIVELY TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE RETURNS WHILE LIMITING EXPOSURE TO RISKS.  APPROXIMATELY

94% OF THE FIXED MATURITIES PORTFOLIO IS RATED AT INVESTMENT GRADE

LEVELS (BBB- OR BETTER).  THE REMAINING 6% OF THE PORTFOLIO IS

SPLIT BETWEEN NONRATED AND NON-INVESTMENT GRADE (HIGH-YIELD)

SECURITIES.  WE BELIEVE THE NONRATED SECURITIES WOULD BE CONSIDERED

INVESTMENT-GRADE IN QUALITY IF RATED.

EQUITIES.  EQUITY SECURITIES COMPRISED 5% OF THE PROPERTY-LIABILITY

OPERATIONS' INVESTMENTS (AT COST) AT DEC. 31, 2000, AND CONSIST OF

A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF COMMON STOCKS, WHICH ARE HELD WITH THE

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF ACHIEVING CAPITAL APPRECIATION.  SALES OF

EQUITIES GENERATED $95 MILLION OF PRETAX REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS

IN 2000, AND DIVIDEND INCOME TOTALED $15 MILLION.  THE PORTFOLIO'S

CARRYING VALUE AT YEAR-END INCLUDED $326 MILLION OF PRETAX

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION.

REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE LOANS.  OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONS'

REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS CONSIST OF A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF

COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND WAREHOUSE PROPERTIES THAT WE OWN DIRECTLY OR

HAVE PARTIAL INTEREST IN THROUGH JOINT VENTURES.  THE PROPERTIES

ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND HAD

AN OCCUPANCY RATE OF 95% AT DEC. 31, 2000.  WE ALSO HAVE A

PORTFOLIO OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED IN THE

MERGER WITH USF&G.;  THE REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO

PRODUCED $103 MILLION OF PRETAX INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2000 AND

GENERATED $4 MILLION OF PRETAX REALIZED GAINS.

VENTURE CAPITAL.  SECURITIES OF SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES

SPANNING A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES COMPRISE OUR VENTURE CAPITAL

HOLDINGS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 3% OF PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS

(AT COST) AT DEC. 31, 2000.  THESE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE FORM OF

LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OR DIRECT EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS GENERATED PRETAX REALIZED INVESTMENT

GAINS OF $554 MILLION IN 2000.  THE CARRYING VALUE OF VENTURE

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AT DEC. 31, 2000 INCLUDED $406 MILLION OF

PRETAX UNREALIZED APPRECIATION.

SECURITIES LENDING COLLATERAL.  THIS INVESTMENT CLASS, WHICH

COMPRISED 6% OF PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS AT  DEC. 31, 2000,

CONSISTS OF COLLATERAL HELD ON CERTAIN FIXED-MATURITY SECURITIES

LOANED TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS THROUGH A LENDING AGENT FOR SHORT

PERIODS OF TIME.  THE COLLATERAL IS MAINTAINED AT 102%, MARKED TO

MARKET DAILY, OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES.  WE

RETAIN FULL OWNERSHIP OF THE LOANED SECURITIES AND ARE INDEMNIFIED

BY THE LENDING AGENT IN THE EVENT A BORROWER BECOMES INSOLVENT OR

FAILS TO RETURN THE SECURITIES.

SHORT-TERM AND OTHER INVESTMENTS.  OUR PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDES

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INVESTMENTS, WHICH IN

THE AGGREGATE COMPRISED 6% OF PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS AT

DEC. 31, 2000.

DERIVATIVES.  OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT OPERATIONS HAVE HAD

LIMITED INVOLVEMENT WITH DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

PRIMARILY FOR PURPOSES OF HEDGING AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES.  OUR INVESTMENT

OPERATIONS HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN THE DERIVATIVES MARKET FOR

ASSET MANAGEMENT

THE JOHN NUVEEN COMPANY ("NUVEEN") IS OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT

SUBSIDIARY.  THE ST. PAUL AND ITS LARGEST PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY, ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY

("FIRE AND MARINE") HOLD A COMBINED 78% INTEREST IN NUVEEN.

NUVEEN'S PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES ARE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND THE

DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES FOR ADVISORS TO THE AFFLUENT AND HIGH-NET-WORTH MARKET

SEGMENTS.  NUVEEN PROVIDES INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

INDIVIDUALLY MANAGED ACCOUNTS, MUTUAL FUNDS, EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS

(CLOSED-END FUNDS) AND DEFINED PORTFOLIOS THROUGH REGISTERED

REPRESENTATIVES ASSOCIATED WITH UNAFFILIATED FIRMS, INCLUDING

BROKER-DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, AFFILIATES OF INSURANCE

PROVIDERS, FINANCIAL PLANNERS, ACCOUNTANTS, CONSULTANTS, AND

INVESTMENT ADVISERS.

NUVEEN'S PRIMARY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES GENERATE TWO PRINCIPAL SOURCES

OF REVENUE:  (1) ONGOING ADVISORY FEES EARNED ON ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INDIVIDUALLY MANAGED ACCOUNTS, MUTUAL FUNDS

AND EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS; AND (2) TRANSACTION-BASED REVENUE EARNED

UPON THE SALE OF DEFINED PORTFOLIO AND MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTS.

NUVEEN'S BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED THROUGH SIX SUBSIDIARIES: NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS, A REGISTERED BROKER AND DEALER IN SECURITIES UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND FIVE INVESTMENT ADVISORY

SUBSIDIARIES REGISTERED UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940.

THE FIVE INVESTMENT ADVISORY SUBSIDIARIES ARE NUVEEN ADVISORY CORP.

(NAC), NUVEEN INSTITUTIONAL ADVISORY CORP. (NIAC), NUVEEN ASSET

MANAGEMENT INC. (NAM), RITTENHOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.

(RITTENHOUSE) AND NUVEEN SENIOR LOAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.

(NSLAM).  NUVEEN INVESTMENTS PROVIDES INVESTMENT PRODUCT

DISTRIBUTION AND RELATED SERVICES FOR NUVEEN'S MANAGED FUNDS AND

DEFINED PORTFOLIOS.  NAC, NIAC AND NSLAM PROVIDE INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR AND ADMINISTER THE BUSINESS AFFAIRS OF THE

NUVEEN MANAGED FUNDS.  RITTENHOUSE AND NAM PROVIDE INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALLY MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND

RITTENHOUSE ALSO ACTS AS SUB-ADVISER AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER FOR A

MUTUAL FUND MANAGED BY NIAC.

AT DEC. 31, 2000, NUVEEN'S ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT TOTALED $62.0

BILLION, CONSISTING OF $28.4 BILLION OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS,

$21.7 BILLION OF MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND $11.9 BILLION OF MUTUAL

FUNDS.  MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ACCOUNTED FOR 66% OF THE UNDERLYING

MANAGED ASSETS.

IN 2000, NUVEEN REPURCHASED 1,175,916 OF ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON

SHARES FOR A TOTAL COST OF $51 MILLION. IN 1999, NUVEEN REPURCHASED

914,100 OF ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES FOR A TOTAL COST OF $36

MILLION.  THE REPURCHASES IN BOTH YEARS WERE SOLELY FROM MINORITY

SHAREHOLDERS.  OUR OWNERSHIP SHARE IN NUVEEN DID NOT MATERIALLY

CHANGE IN EITHER YEAR AS A RESULT OF THESE SHARE REPURCHASES, DUE

TO NUVEEN'S ISSUANCE OF COMMON SHARES RELATED TO STOCK OPTION AND

OTHER INCENTIVE PLANS.

COMPETITION AND REGULATION

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN GENERAL CONTINUES TO BE AFFECTED

BY AN INTENSIFYING COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AS DEMONSTRATED BY

CONSOLIDATION THROUGH MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND COMPETITION FROM

NEW ENTRANTS, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS USING NEW

TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE INTERNET, TO ESTABLISH OR EXPAND THEIR

BUSINESS.  THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT, PASSED IN 1999, WHICH

REPEALED U.S. LAWS THAT SEPARATED COMMERCIAL BANKING, INVESTMENT

BANKING AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES, TOGETHER WITH CHANGES TO THE

INDUSTRY RESULTING FROM PREVIOUS REFORMS, HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER

OF COMPANIES COMPETING FOR A SIMILAR CUSTOMER BASE.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE.  OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL

UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER

INSURERS AND REINSURERS.  IN ADDITION, MANY LARGE COMMERCIAL

CUSTOMERS SELF-INSURE THEIR RISKS OR UTILIZE LARGE DEDUCTIBLES ON

PURCHASED INSURANCE.  OUR SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE PRINCIPALLY BY

ATTEMPTING TO OFFER A COMBINATION OF SUPERIOR PRODUCTS,

UNDERWRITING EXPERTISE AND SERVICES AT A COMPETITIVE, YET

PROFITABLE, PRICE.  THE COMBINATION OF PRODUCTS, SERVICES, PRICING

AND OTHER METHODS OF COMPETITION VARIES BY LINE OF INSURANCE AND BY

COVERAGE WITHIN EACH LINE OF INSURANCE.

WE AND OUR UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY

CERTAIN STATES AS AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM.  SUCH

REGULATION GENERALLY PROVIDES THAT TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN COMPANIES

WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM MUST BE FAIR AND EQUITABLE.

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS AMONG SUCH AFFILIATED COMPANIES, CERTAIN

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FROM UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN

MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN COMPANIES WITHIN THE SYSTEM MAY BE

SUBJECT TO PRIOR NOTICE TO, OR PRIOR APPROVAL BY, STATE REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES.  DURING 2000, WE RECEIVED $483 MILLION OF CASH

DIVIDENDS FROM OUR U.S. UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS.  ALTHOUGH $1.6

BILLION WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS IN 2000, BUSINESS AND

REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS MAY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS

ACTUALLY PAID. IN ADDITION, ANY CHANGE OF CONTROL (GENERALLY

PRESUMED BY THE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS TO OCCUR WITH THE ACQUISITION

OF 10% OR MORE OF AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY'S VOTING SECURITIES)

OF THE ST. PAUL AND ITS UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES IS SUBJECT TO

PRIOR APPROVAL BY REGULATORS.

THE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LICENSING AND

SUPERVISION BY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE JURISDICTIONS

IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS.  THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF SUCH

REGULATION VARY BUT GENERALLY HAVE THEIR SOURCE IN STATUTES WHICH

DELEGATE REGULATORY, SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS TO

INSURANCE REGULATORS, WHICH IN THE U.S. ARE STATE AUTHORITIES.

SUCH REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNDERWRITING

SUBSIDIARIES MAY RELATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO THE STANDARDS OF

SOLVENCY WHICH MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED; THE LICENSING OF

INSURERS AND THEIR AGENTS; THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON

INVESTMENTS; RESTRICTIONS ON THE SIZE OF RISK WHICH MAY BE INSURED

UNDER A SINGLE POLICY; DEPOSITS OF SECURITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF

POLICYHOLDERS; REGULATION OF POLICY FORMS AND PREMIUM RATES;

PERIODIC EXAMINATION OF THE AFFAIRS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES; ANNUAL

AND OTHER REPORTS REQUIRED TO BE FILED ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION

OF INSURERS OR FOR OTHER PURPOSES; REQUIREMENTS REGARDING RESERVES

FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND OTHER MATTERS; THE NATURE OF AND

LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND SHAREHOLDERS; THE

NATURE AND EXTENT OF REQUIRED PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE GUARANTY

FUNDS; AND THE INVOLUNTARY ASSUMPTION OF HARD-TO-PLACE OR HIGH-RISK

INSURANCE BUSINESS, PRIMARILY IN WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE

LINES.

LOSS RATIO TRENDS IN PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE UNDERWRITING

EXPERIENCE MAY BE IMPROVED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGING THE

KINDS OF COVERAGES PROVIDED BY POLICIES, PROVIDING LOSS PREVENTION

AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INCREASING PREMIUM RATES, PURCHASING

REINSURANCE OR BY A COMBINATION OF THESE.  THE ABILITY OF OUR

INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET EMERGING ADVERSE

UNDERWRITING TRENDS MAY BE DELAYED, FROM TIME TO TIME, BY THE

EFFECTS OF LAWS WHICH REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL BY INSURANCE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CHANGES IN POLICY FORMS AND PREMIUM

RATES.  OUR U.S. UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS DO BUSINESS IN ALL 50

STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO, GUAM AND THE U.S.

VIRGIN ISLANDS.  MANY OF THESE JURISDICTIONS REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL

OF MOST OR ALL PREMIUM RATES.

OUR INSURANCE UNDERWRITING BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IS

REGULATED BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA).  THE FSA'S

PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES ARE TO ENSURE THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

RESPONSIBLY MANAGED, THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDS TO MEET

LIABILITIES TO POLICYHOLDERS AND THAT THEY MAINTAIN REQUIRED LEVELS

OF SOLVENCY.  IN CANADA, THE CONDUCT OF INSURANCE BUSINESS IS

REGULATED UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT OF 1992,

WHICH REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVELS OF

CAPITAL DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSURANCE POLICIES IN

FORCE.  THE LLOYD'S OPERATION IS CURRENTLY REGULATED BY THE COUNCIL

OF LLOYD'S, A SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATION, WHICH WILL IN DUE

COURSE BE REGULATED BY THE FSA.  WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS

IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE UNDERWRITE

INSURANCE BUSINESS.

LIFE INSURANCE.  OUR LIFE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE IN A

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, WITH APPROXIMATELY 1,400 COMPANIES

NATIONWIDE IN THE INDUSTRY INCLUDING STOCK AND MUTUAL COMPANIES.

F&G; LIFE RANKED 117TH BASED ON 1999 STATUTORY NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN,

120TH BASED ON 1999 STATUTORY ASSETS, AND 174TH BASED ON 1999

STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS.  IN THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY,

INTEREST CREDITING RATES, UNDERWRITING PHILOSOPHY, POLICY FEATURES,

FINANCIAL STABILITY, CREDIT STANDING AND SERVICE QUALITY ARE

IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS.  F&G; LIFE'S PRODUCTS COMPETE NOT

ONLY WITH THOSE OFFERED BY OTHER LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES, BUT ALSO

WITH OTHER INCOME ACCUMULATION-ORIENTED PRODUCTS OFFERED BY OTHER

FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES.  THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS

EXPERIENCED CONSIDERABLE COMPETITIVE AND ECONOMIC PRESSURE IN

RECENT PERIODS AS A RESULT OF FLUCTUATING INTEREST RATES AND OTHER

FACTORS.

F&G; LIFE IS SUBJECT TO LICENSING AND SUPERVISION BY GOVERNMENT

REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS.

THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF REGULATION VARY BUT GENERALLY HAVE THEIR

SOURCE IN STATUTES WHICH DELEGATE REGULATORY, SUPERVISORY AND

ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS TO STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS.  SUCH

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF F&G; LIFE MAY RELATE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, TO THE STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY WHICH MUST BE MET AND

MAINTAINED; THE LICENSING OF INSURERS AND AGENTS; THE NATURE OF AND

LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS; DEPOSITS OF SECURITIES FOR THE BENEFIT

OF POLICYHOLDERS; REGULATION OF POLICY FORMS; PERIODIC EXAMINATION

OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE COMPANY; ANNUAL AND OTHER REPORTS REQUIRED TO

BE FILED; REQUIREMENTS REGARDING RESERVES FOR POLICYHOLDER

BENEFITS; FIXING MAXIMUM INTEREST RATES ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICY

LOANS AND MINIMUM RATES FOR ACCUMULATION OF SURRENDER VALUES; THE

NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND

SHAREHOLDERS; AND THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF REQUIRED PARTICIPATION

IN INSURANCE GUARANTY FUNDS.

ASSET MANAGEMENT.  NUVEEN IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN

ALL ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS.  INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD TO THE

PUBLIC BY BROKER-DEALERS, BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHERS.

NUVEEN COMPETES WITH THESE OTHER PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS PRIMARILY ON

THE BASIS OF THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS OFFERED, THE INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE OF SUCH PRODUCTS, QUALITY OF SERVICE, FEES CHARGED, THE

LEVEL AND TYPE OF BROKER COMPENSATION, THE MANNER IN WHICH SUCH

PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED AND DISTRIBUTED, AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO

INVESTORS.

NUVEEN IS A PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANY REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND LISTED ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.

ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, IS A BROKER-DEALER

REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND IS

SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS, INC. AND OTHER

FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS.  IT

IS ALSO SUBJECT TO NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT RESTRICT ITS

ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS.  NUVEEN'S OTHER FIVE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

INVESTMENT ADVISERS REGISTERED UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF

1940.  AS SUCH, THEY ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

FIRE AND MARINE OWNS OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS BUILDINGS, LOCATED

AT 385 WASHINGTON STREET AND 130 WEST SIXTH STREET, ST. PAUL, MN.

THESE BUILDINGS ARE ADJACENT TO ONE ANOTHER AND CONSIST OF

APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GROSS FLOOR SPACE.  FIRE

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES BUILDING AND OFF-SITE COMPUTER PROCESSING

OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED.  FIRE AND MARINE ALSO OWNS THE FORMER USF&G;

HEADQUARTERS CAMPUS KNOWN AS MOUNT WASHINGTON CENTER, LOCATED IN

BALTIMORE, MD.  THE CAMPUS CURRENTLY HOUSES OFFICES FOR CERTAIN

EXECUTIVES OF THE ST. PAUL, AS WELL AS OFFICES FOR CERTAIN

UNDERWRITING, LEGAL AND CLAIM PERSONNEL.  A TRAINING AND

DEVELOPMENT CENTER ALSO RESIDES ON THE MOUNT WASHINGTON CAMPUS.

FIRE AND MARINE HAS LEASED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ONE OF THE

BUILDINGS ON THE CAMPUS TO AN OUTSIDE PARTY.

ST. PAUL INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY LTD. OWNS A BUILDING IN

LONDON, ENGLAND, WHICH HOUSES A PORTION OF ITS OPERATIONS.  WE

RETAINED OWNERSHIP OF ANOTHER BUILDING IN LONDON SUBSEQUENT TO THE

SALE OF MINET TO AON IN 1997, WHICH WE WERE LEASING TO AN OUTSIDE

PARTY AT DEC. 31, 2000.  IN A TRANSACTION COMPLETED IN MARCH 2001,

WE SOLD A 50% INTEREST IN THIS BUILDING.

FIRE AND MARINE AND ITS SUBSIDIARY, ST. PAUL PROPERTIES, INC., OWN

A PORTFOLIO OF INCOME-PRODUCING PROPERTIES IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS

ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT THEY HAVE PURCHASED FOR INVESTMENT.

OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES RENT OR LEASE OFFICE SPACE IN MOST

CITIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE CURRENTLY OWNED AND LEASED OFFICE

FACILITIES OF THE ST. PAUL AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ADEQUATE FOR THE

CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE LEVEL OF OPERATIONS.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

------    -----------------

THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THE "LEGAL MATTERS" SECTION OF NOTE 13

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE "ENVIRONMENTAL

AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS" SECTION OF "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS," WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OUR 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS ON PAGES 67 AND 68, AND 36, RESPECTIVELY, ARE

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

IN 1990, AT THE DIRECTION OF THE UK DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND

INDUSTRY (DTI), FIVE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES OF LONDON

UNITED INVESTMENTS PLC (LUI) SUSPENDED UNDERWRITING NEW INSURANCE

BUSINESS.  AT THE SAME TIME, FOUR OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES, BEING

INSOLVENT, SUSPENDED PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND HAVE SINCE BEEN PLACED

IN PROVISIONAL LIQUIDATION.  THE FIFTH SUBSIDIARY, WALBROOK

INSURANCE COMPANY, CONTINUED PAYING CLAIMS UNTIL MAY OF 1992 BUT

HAS NOW ALSO BEEN PLACED IN PROVISIONAL INSOLVENT LIQUIDATION.

WEAVERS UNDERWRITING AGENCY (WEAVERS), AN LUI SUBSIDIARY, MANAGED

THESE INSURERS.  MINET, A FORMER INSURANCE BROKERAGE SUBSIDIARY OF

OURS, HAD BROKERED BUSINESS TO AND FROM WEAVERS FOR MANY YEARS.

FROM 1973 THROUGH 1980, OUR UK-BASED UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS, NOW

CALLED ST. PAUL INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY LTD. (SPI), HAD

ACCEPTED BUSINESS FROM WEAVERS.  A PORTION OF THAT BUSINESS WAS

CEDED BY SPI TO REINSURERS.  CERTAIN OF THOSE REINSURERS HAVE

CHALLENGED THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN REINSURANCE CONTRACTS RELATING

TO THE WEAVERS POOL, OF WHICH SPI WAS A MEMBER, IN AN ATTEMPT TO

AVOID LIABILITY UNDER THOSE CONTRACTS.  SPI AND OTHER MEMBERS OF

THE WEAVERS POOL ARE SEEKING ENFORCEMENT OF THE REINSURANCE

CONTRACTS.  MINET MAY ALSO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ARISING FROM ITS ROLE AS ONE OF THE MAJOR BROKERS FOR WEAVERS.

WHEN WE SOLD MINET IN MAY 1997, WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THE

PURCHASER FOR MOST OF MINET'S PRECLOSING LIABILITIES, INCLUDING

LIABILITIES RELATING TO THE WEAVERS MATTER. WE WILL VIGOROUSLY

CONTEST ANY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THE WEAVERS MATTER AND WE

RECOGNIZE THAT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, IF ADVERSE

TO US, MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THAT OUTCOME OCCURS, BUT WE BELIEVE IT WILL NOT

HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY OR OVERALL

FINANCIAL POSITION.
