TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY) IS A HOLDING COMPANY PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED,

THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, IN PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT UNITS, ASSOCIATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. THE

COMPANY IS INCORPORATED AS A GENERAL BUSINESS

CORPORATION UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA AND IS ONE OF THE OLDEST INSURANCE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, DATING BACK TO 1853. THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF THE COMPANY ARE

LOCATED AT 485 LEXINGTON AVENUE, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10017, AND ITS TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (917) 778-6000. THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS EXECUTIVE OFFICES IN HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT, AND

ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA. THE TERM "TRV" IN THIS DOCUMENT REFERS TO THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY EXCLUDING SUBSIDIARIES.

FOR

A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND TOTAL ASSETS BY REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE AREAS OF PRICE, SERVICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AGENT RELATIONSHIPS AND

METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION. DISTRIBUTION METHODS INCLUDE THE USE OF INDEPENDENT AGENTS, EXCLUSIVE AGENTS, DIRECT MARKETING AND/OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES. ACCORDING TO A.M. BEST, THERE ARE

APPROXIMATELY 1,200 PROPERTY AND CASUALTY GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES, COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 2,650 PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COMPANIES. OF THOSE GROUPS, THE TOP 150 ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 92% OF

THE CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRY'S TOTAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2015. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INSURERS. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL

LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS AND

VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE, SOME OF WHICH UTILIZE CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS. THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

THE FOLLOWING.



ABILITY TO PROFITABLY PRICE BUSINESS, RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND OBTAIN NEW BUSINESS;



PREMIUMS CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED (INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED PROGRAMS);



AGENT, BROKER AND POLICYHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS;



ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS;



SPEED OF CLAIMS PAYMENT;



ABILITY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER;



ABILITY TO ADAPT TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS MODELS, TECHNOLOGY, CUSTOMER PREFERENCES OR REGULATION IMPACTING THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY

OPERATES;



PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CORRESPONDING RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES;



REPUTATION, EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES;



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS; AND



LOCAL PRESENCE.

IN

ADDITION, THE MARKETPLACE IS AFFECTED BY THE AVAILABLE CAPACITY OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, AS MEASURED BY STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE FROM BOTH

TRADITIONAL

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SOURCES,

SUCH AS REINSURANCE COMPANIES AND CAPITAL MARKETS (THROUGH CATASTROPHE BONDS), AND NON-TRADITIONAL SOURCES, SUCH AS HEDGE FUNDS AND PENSION PLANS. INDUSTRY CAPACITY AS MEASURED BY STATUTORY

CAPITAL AND SURPLUS EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS PRIMARILY IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROFIT LEVELS GENERATED BY THE INDUSTRY, LESS AMOUNTS RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. CAPITAL

RAISED BY DEBT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS MAY ALSO INCREASE STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN ESTIMATION OF EXPECTED LOSSES, THE

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCING, ISSUING AND SERVICING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY RELATED TO THE EXPECTED LOSS AND EXPENSE CASH FLOWS, AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR

PROFIT THAT CONSIDERS THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. THE COMPANY HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES PRODUCT RETURNS AND PROFITABLE

GROWTH OVER THE LONG-TERM RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING RATE AND POLICY FORM APPROVALS. THE

APPLICABLE STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISH STANDARDS IN CERTAIN LINES OF BUSINESS TO ENSURE THAT RATES ARE NOT EXCESSIVE, INADEQUATE, UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY, OR USED TO ENGAGE IN UNFAIR PRICE

COMPETITION. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO INCREASE RATES AND THE RELATIVE TIMING OF THE PROCESS ARE DEPENDENT UPON EACH RESPECTIVE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE COMPETITIVE MARKET ENVIRONMENT.

CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE

THE WIDE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSES IT TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF CATASTROPHES.

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY AND THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER MODELING PROCESSES, TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR AND ANALYZE UNDERWRITING RISKS OF BUSINESS IN NATURAL

CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS AND TARGET RISK AREAS FOR CONVENTIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS (DEFINED AS ATTACKS OTHER THAN NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS). THE COMPANY RELIES, IN PART, UPON

THESE ANALYSES TO MAKE UNDERWRITING DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE ON CATASTROPHE-EXPOSED BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF THESE ANALYSES, THE COMPANY HAS AT VARIOUS TIMES LIMITED THE

WRITING OF NEW PROPERTY AND HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS IN SOME MARKETS AND HAS SELECTIVELY TAKEN UNDERWRITING ACTIONS ON NEW AND EXISTING BUSINESS. THESE UNDERWRITING ACTIONS ON NEW AND EXISTING BUSINESS

INCLUDE TIGHTENING UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, SELECTIVE PRICE INCREASES AND CHANGES TO DEDUCTIBLES SPECIFIC TO HURRICANE-, TORNADO-, WIND- AND HAIL-PRONE AREAS. SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING" AND "CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS." THE

BUSINESS

DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER ATTRIBUTES, EACH AGENCY'S OR BROKER'S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, STAFF EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH THE COMPANY'S

OPERATING AND MARKETING PLANS. ONCE AN AGENCY OR BROKER IS APPOINTED, BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE CAREFULLY MONITORS ITS PERFORMANCE. THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCTS OFFERED IN THE UNITED STATES ARE

DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A COMMON BASE OF INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, MANY OF WHOM ALSO SELL THE COMPANY'S PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL OPERATIONS MAY UNDERWRITE BUSINESS WITH

AGENTS THAT SPECIALIZE IN SERVICING THE NEEDS OF CERTAIN OF THE INDUSTRIES SERVED BY THESE OPERATIONS. BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE CONTINUES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ENHANCED

COVERING PROPERTY AND LIABILITY EXPOSURES. EACH SMALL BUSINESS RISK IS INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATED VIA AN AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING PLATFORM WHICH IN TURN ENABLES AGENTS TO QUOTE, BIND AND ISSUE A

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF NEW SMALL BUSINESS RISKS AT THEIR DESKTOP IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN QUOTING A PRICE ON A NEW POLICY AND

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ISSUING

THAT POLICY. RISKS WITH MORE COMPLEX CHARACTERISTICS ARE UNDERWRITTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF COMPANY PERSONNEL. SELECT ACCOUNTS HAS ESTABLISHED A STRONG MARKETING RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND HAS PROVIDED THIS NETWORK WITH DEFINED UNDERWRITING POLICIES, A BROAD ARRAY OF PRODUCTS AND COMPETITIVE PRICES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED CENTRALIZED SERVICE

CENTERS TO HELP AGENTS PERFORM MANY SERVICE FUNCTIONS, IN RETURN FOR A FEE.



MIDDLE MARKET

BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES WITH 50 TO 1,000 EMPLOYEES THROUGH A LARGE NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. THE COMPANY OFFERS A FULL LINE OF PRODUCTS TO ITS MIDDLE MARKET CUSTOMERS WITH AN

EMPHASIS ON GUARANTEED COST PROGRAMS. EACH ACCOUNT IS UNDERWRITTEN BASED ON THE UNIQUE RISK CHARACTERISTICS, LOSS HISTORY AND COVERAGE NEEDS OF THE ACCOUNT. THE ABILITY TO UNDERWRITE AT THIS DETAILED

LEVEL ALLOWS MIDDLE MARKET TO HAVE A BROAD RISK APPETITE AND A DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE. WITHIN MIDDLE MARKET, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE TAILORED TO CERTAIN TARGETED INDUSTRY SEGMENTS OF SIGNIFICANT

SIZE AND COMPLEXITY THAT REQUIRE UNIQUE UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, RISK MANAGEMENT OR OTHER INSURANCE-RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

ADMINISTRATORS FOR INSUREDS WHO UTILIZE PROGRAMS SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED DEDUCTIBLES, CAPTIVE REINSURERS AND SELF-INSURANCE. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS PROVIDES INSURANCE-RELATED SERVICES, SUCH AS RISK

MANAGEMENT SERVICES, CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION, LOSS CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SERVICES, EITHER IN ADDITION TO, OR IN LIEU OF, PURE RISK COVERAGE, AND GENERATED $253 MILLION OF FEE

CERTAIN AFFINITY ARRANGEMENTS IN SPECIALIZED MARKET SEGMENTS. THE WHOLESALE EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES MARKET, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF RATE AND FORM REGULATION, ALLOWS FOR MORE

FLEXIBILITY TO WRITE CERTAIN CLASSES OF BUSINESS. IN WORKING WITH AGENTS OR PROGRAM MANAGERS ON A BROKERAGE BASIS, SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION UNDERWRITES THE BUSINESS AND SETS THE PREMIUM LEVEL. IN

WORKING WITH AGENTS OR PROGRAM MANAGERS WITH DELEGATED UNDERWRITING AUTHORITY, THE AGENTS PRODUCE AND UNDERWRITE BUSINESS SUBJECT TO UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR

INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS PRINCIPALLY THROUGH BROKERS IN EACH OF THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES. INTERNATIONAL ALSO WRITES BUSINESS AT LLOYD'S, WHERE ITS PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH LLOYD'S WHOLESALE AND RETAIL BROKERS. BY VIRTUE OF LLOYD'S WORLDWIDE LICENSES,

BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE HAS ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS ACROSS THE WORLD.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE UTILIZES UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINES FOR PARTICULAR

INDUSTRIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS OF PROPRIETARY DATA GATHERED AND ANALYZED OVER MANY YEARS, TO FACILITATE ITS RISK SELECTION PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING PARAMETERS. THE COMPANY

UTILIZES BOTH STANDARD INDUSTRY FORMS AND PROPRIETARY FORMS FOR THE INSURANCE POLICIES IT ISSUES.

A

PORTION OF BUSINESS IN THIS SEGMENT, PARTICULARLY IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSTRUCTION, IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE

CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT

AND IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK UNTIL SUCH REIMBURSEMENT IS MADE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES ON UNPAID LOSSES WITHIN THE DEDUCTIBLE LAYER OF LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES AND THE

ASSOCIATED RECEIVABLES WERE EACH APPROXIMATELY $4.61 BILLION. BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE ALSO UTILIZES RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES FOR ANOTHER PORTION OF THE BUSINESS, PRIMARILY

FOR WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGE. ALTHOUGH THE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED FEATURE OF THE POLICY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES INSURANCE RISK FOR THE COMPANY, IT INTRODUCES ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY.

PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE FROM HOLDERS OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $70 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016. SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND, TO A

LESSER EXTENT, CASH COLLATERAL, TRUSTS OR SURETY BONDS, IS GENERALLY OBTAINED FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PLANS AND/OR RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES THAT PROVIDE FOR DEFERRED COLLECTION OF DEDUCTIBLE

RECOVERIES AND/OR ULTIMATE PREMIUMS. THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL REQUESTED IS PREDICATED UPON THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER AND THE NATURE OF THE INSURED RISKS. BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL

INSURANCE CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE CREDIT EXPOSURE ON INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS AND THE ADEQUACY OF COLLATERAL. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES, SEE

"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSWE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN OF OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN GUARANTEE OR INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS

THAT WE HAVE WITH THIRD PARTIES."

COMPETITION

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS REPRESENTED IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE BY MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZE AS WELL AS OTHER ENTITIES

OFFERING RISK ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS OR CAPTIVE PROGRAMS. MARKET COMPETITION WORKS WITHIN THE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO SET THE PRICE CHARGED FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND

THE LEVELS OF COVERAGE AND SERVICE PROVIDED. A COMPANY'S SUCCESS IN THE COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE LANDSCAPE IS LARGELY MEASURED BY ITS ABILITY

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO

PROFITABLY PROVIDE INSURANCE AND SERVICES, INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING AND RISK CONTROL, AT PRICES AND TERMS THAT RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS. SEE

"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSTHE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE, AND THE IMPACT OF INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES ON THE INSURANCE

INDUSTRY AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY."

DOMESTIC

COMPETITORS TYPICALLY WRITE SELECT ACCOUNTS BUSINESS THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS, AND AS DIRECT

WRITERS. BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE IN THE SELECT ACCOUNTS MARKET WHICH GENERALLY COMPRISES LOWER-HAZARD, "MAIN STREET" BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. RISKS ARE

UNDERWRITTEN AND PRICED USING STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRODUCT OFFERINGS. COMPETITION IN THIS MARKET IS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRODUCT OFFERINGS,

SERVICE LEVELS, EASE OF DOING BUSINESS AND PRICE.

COMPETITORS

TYPICALLY WRITE MIDDLE MARKET BUSINESS THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. SEVERAL OF MIDDLE MARKET'S OPERATIONS REQUIRE UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE,

CUSTOMIZED COVERAGE, SPECIALIZED RISK CONTROL AND LOSS HANDLING SERVICES, ALONG WITH PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENTS AND BROKERS THAT ALSO FOCUS ON THESE MARKETS. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY

NATIONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND PRICING, AND REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES. COMPANIES COMPETE BASED ON PRODUCT

OFFERINGS, SERVICE LEVELS, PRICE AND CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES. EFFICIENCY THROUGH AUTOMATION AND RESPONSE TIME TO AGENT, BROKER AND CUSTOMER NEEDS IS ONE KEY TO SUCCESS IN THIS MARKET.

IN

THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS MARKET, COMPETITION IS BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES, MANAGED CARE COST CONTAINMENT, RISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY COMPETES WITH NATIONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS WITH OTHER UNDERWRITERS OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE IN THE

ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER MARKET, SUCH AS SELF-INSURANCE PLANS, CAPTIVES MANAGED BY OTHERS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER RISK-FINANCING VEHICLES AND MECHANISMS. THE RESIDUAL MARKET DIVISION COMPETES FOR

STATE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

FIRST

PARTY AND SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION COMPETE IN FOCUSED TARGET MARKETS. EACH OF THESE MARKETS IS DIFFERENT AND REQUIRES UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE, CUSTOMIZED

COVERAGE, SPECIALIZED RISK CONTROL AND LOSS HANDLING SERVICES, ALONG WITH PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENTS AND BROKERS THAT ALSO FOCUS ON THESE MARKETS. SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH NATIONAL CARRIERS

WITH SIMILARLY DEDICATED UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING GROUPS, WHEREAS OTHERS COMPETE WITH SMALLER REGIONAL COMPANIES. EACH OF THESE BUSINESSES HAS REGIONAL STRUCTURES THAT ALLOW THEM TO DELIVER

PERSONALIZED SERVICE AND LOCAL KNOWLEDGE TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. SPECIALIZED AGENTS AND BROKERS, INCLUDING WHOLESALE AGENTS AND PROGRAM MANAGERS, SUPPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY. IN ALL OF THESE BUSINESSES,

THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY TYPICALLY IS THE APPLICATION OF FOCUSED INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE TO INSURANCE AND RISK NEEDS.

INTERNATIONAL

INTERNATIONAL COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC INSURERS IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND BRAZIL.

COMPANIES COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE LEVEL OF CLAIM AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROVIDED. THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED EXPERTISE IN VARIOUS MARKETS IN THESE COUNTRIES

SIMILAR TO THOSE SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDES BOTH PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COVERAGE FOR THESE MARKETS.

AT

LLOYD'S, INTERNATIONAL COMPETES WITH OTHER SYNDICATES OPERATING IN THE LLOYD'S MARKET AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC INSURERS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS WHERE THE LLOYD'S OPERATION

WRITES BUSINESS WORLDWIDE. COMPETITION IS AGAIN BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT AND SERVICE. THE COMPANY FOCUSES ON LINES IT BELIEVES IT CAN UNDERWRITE EFFECTIVELY AND PROFITABLY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON

SHORT-TAIL INSURANCE LINES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BOND &

SPECIALTY INSURANCE UNDERWRITES AND MARKETS ITS PRODUCTS TO ALL SIZES OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS

REPUTATION FOR TIMELY AND CONSISTENT DECISION MAKING, A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCAL UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS AND INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND STRONG PRODUCER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AS WELL AS ITS ABILITY TO

OFFER ITS CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE OF PRODUCTS, PROVIDES BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE AN ADVANTAGE OVER MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS AND ENABLES IT TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN A COMPLEX, DYNAMIC

MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE ABILITY OF BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE TO CROSS-SELL ITS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS OF BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE AND PERSONAL INSURANCE PROVIDES

ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES FOR THE COMPANY. SEE "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSTHE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE, AND THE IMPACT OF INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND

PRINCIPAL MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION

PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED AND DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 10,900 ACTIVE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES LOCATED THROUGHOUT

THE UNITED STATES, SUPPORTED BY PERSONNEL IN NINE SALES REGIONS. IN ADDITION, SALES AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH FIVE CONTACT CENTERS. WHILE THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS FOR PERSONAL

INSURANCE PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO BE IN STATES ALONG THE EAST COAST, CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS, THE BUSINESS CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

IN

SELECTING NEW INDEPENDENT AGENCIES TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, PERSONAL INSURANCE CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER ATTRIBUTES, EACH AGENCY'S PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL STABILITY, STAFF EXPERIENCE

AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH ITS OPERATING AND MARKETING PLANS. ONCE AN AGENCY IS APPOINTED, PERSONAL INSURANCE CAREFULLY MONITORS ITS PERFORMANCE.

AGENTS

CAN ACCESS THE COMPANY'S AGENCY SERVICE PORTAL FOR A NUMBER OF RESOURCES INCLUDING CUSTOMER SERVICE, MARKETING AND CLAIMS MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, AGENCIES CAN CHOOSE TO SHIFT THE

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ONGOING

SERVICE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE'S CUSTOMERS TO ONE OF THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER CARE CENTERS, WHERE THE COMPANY PROVIDES, ON BEHALF OF AN AGENCY, A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF CUSTOMER

SERVICE NEEDS, INCLUDING RESPONSE TO BILLING AND COVERAGE INQUIRIES, AND POLICY CHANGES. APPROXIMATELY 1,400 AGENTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SERVICE ALTERNATIVE, FOR WHICH THEY GENERALLY PAY A FEE.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE ALSO MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH ADDITIONAL CHANNELS, INCLUDING CORPORATIONS THAT MAKE THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS AVAILABLE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES

PRIMARILY THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTION, CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS AND AFFINITY GROUPS. PERSONAL INSURANCE HANDLES THE SALES AND SERVICE FOR THESE PROGRAMS EITHER THROUGH A SPONSORING INDEPENDENT AGENT OR

THROUGH THE COMPANY'S CONTACT CENTER LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION, SINCE 1995, THE COMPANY HAS HAD A MARKETING AGREEMENT WITH GEICO TO UNDERWRITE HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS FOR CERTAIN OF THEIR AUTO CUSTOMERS.

THE

COMPANY ALSO MARKETS ITS INSURANCE PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS, LARGELY THROUGH ONLINE CHANNELS. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN THE DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER INITIATIVE, WHICH BEGAN IN

2009, HAS GENERATED GROWING BUT STILL MODEST PREMIUM VOLUME FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE IN RECENT YEARS, REFLECTIVE OF THE COMPANY'S TARGETED CUSTOMER BASE. THE DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER INITIATIVE, WHILE

INTENDED TO ENHANCE THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN A CONSUMER-DRIVEN MARKETPLACE, IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN MODEST WITH RESPECT TO PREMIUM VOLUME AND REMAIN UNPROFITABLE FOR A

NUMBER OF YEARS.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PERSONAL INSURANCE HAS DEVELOPED A PRODUCT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT INTEGRATES THE DISCIPLINES OF UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING DISCIPLINE AND PRICING SEGMENTATION. PROPRIETARY DATA ACCUMULATED OVER MANY YEARS IS ANALYZED AND PERSONAL INSURANCE USES A

VARIETY OF RISK DIFFERENTIATION MODELS TO FACILITATE ITS PRICING SEGMENTATION. THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT MANAGEMENT AREA ESTABLISHES UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES INTEGRATED WITH ITS FILED PRICING AND RATING

PLANS, WHICH ENABLE PERSONAL INSURANCE TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE ITS RISK SELECTION AND PRICING PROCESSES.

PRICING

FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE IS DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND CHANGES IN SEVERITY, INCLUDING INFLATION IN THE COST OF AUTOMOBILE REPAIRS,

MEDICAL CARE AND RESOLUTION OF LIABILITY CLAIMS. PRICING IN THE HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS IS DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND CHANGES IN SEVERITY, INCLUDING INFLATION IN THE

COST OF BUILDING SUPPLIES, LABOR AND HOUSEHOLD POSSESSIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY MULTIPLE PERIL COVERAGE, THE PROFITABILITY AND PRICING OF BOTH HOMEOWNERS AND AUTOMOBILE

INSURANCE ARE AFFECTED BY THE INCIDENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO WEATHER AND, FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE, EARTHQUAKES. INSURERS WRITING PERSONAL LINES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

POLICIES MAY BE UNABLE TO INCREASE PRICES UNTIL SOME TIME AFTER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COVERAGE HAVE INCREASED, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF STATE INSURANCE RATE REGULATION. THE PACE AT WHICH AN INSURER

CAN CHANGE RATES IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED COSTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON WHETHER THE APPLICABLE STATE LAW REQUIRES PRIOR APPROVAL OF RATE INCREASES OR NOTIFICATION TO THE REGULATOR EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER

A RATE CHANGE IS IMPOSED. IN STATES WITH PRIOR APPROVAL LAWS, RATES MUST BE APPROVED BY THE REGULATOR BEFORE BEING USED BY THE INSURER. IN STATES HAVING "FILE-AND-USE" LAWS, THE INSURER MUST FILE RATE

CHANGES WITH THE REGULATOR, BUT DOES NOT NEED TO WAIT FOR APPROVAL BEFORE USING THE NEW RATES. A "USE-AND-FILE" LAW REQUIRES AN INSURER TO FILE RATES WITHIN A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE INSURER BEGINS

USING THE NEW RATE. APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE STATES REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL OF MOST RATE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES TO METHODS OF MARKETING AND UNDERWRITING IN SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

STATE-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, WHICH CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN INSURER TO SIGNIFICANTLY MANAGE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES.

THE

COMPANY'S ABILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO RAISE PRICES, MODIFY UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCE EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND/OR CHANGES IN THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE. THE

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANY

ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE WRITE IN SOME STATES FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING ACCESS TO OTHER COMMERCIAL OR PERSONAL UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES. IN

CHOOSING TO WRITE BUSINESS IN SOME STATES, THE COMPANY ALSO CONSIDERS THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THOSE STATES' RESIDUAL MARKETS AND GUARANTY FUNDS, AS WELL AS OTHER PROPERTY AND CASUALTY BUSINESS THE

COMPANY WRITES IN THOSE STATES.

PRODUCT LINES

THE PRIMARY COVERAGES IN PERSONAL INSURANCE ARE PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER INSURANCE SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS. PERSONAL INSURANCE

HAD APPROXIMATELY 6.9 MILLION ACTIVE POLICIES (E.G., POLICIES-IN-FORCE) AT DECEMBER 31, 2016.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE WRITES THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF COVERAGES.



PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY TO OTHERS FOR BOTH BODILY INJURY AND

PROPERTY DAMAGE, UNINSURED MOTORIST PROTECTION, AND FOR PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO AN INSURED'S OWN VEHICLE FROM COLLISION, FIRE, FLOOD, HAIL AND THEFT. IN ADDITION, MANY STATES REQUIRE POLICIES TO PROVIDE

FIRST-PARTY PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION, FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AS NO-FAULT COVERAGE.



HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER

PROVIDES PROTECTION AGAINST LOSSES TO RESIDENCES AND CONTENTS FROM A

VARIETY OF PERILS (EXCLUDING FLOODING) AS WELL AS COVERAGE FOR PERSONAL LIABILITY. THE COMPANY WRITES HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE FOR DWELLINGS, CONDOMINIUMS AND TENANTS, AND RENTAL PROPERTIES. THE COMPANY

ALSO WRITES COVERAGE FOR BOATS AND YACHTS AND VALUABLE PERSONAL ITEMS SUCH AS JEWELRY, AND ALSO WRITES COVERAGES FOR UMBRELLA LIABILITY, IDENTITY FRAUD, AND WEDDINGS AND SPECIAL EVENTS.

NET RETENTION POLICY PER RISK

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S RETENTION POLICY WITH RESPECT TO PERSONAL INSURANCE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017. PERSONAL

INSURANCE GENERALLY RETAINS ITS PRIMARY PERSONAL AUTO EXPOSURES IN THEIR ENTIRETY. FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY INSURANCE, THERE IS AN $8.0 MILLION MAXIMUM RETENTION PER RISK, NET OF REINSURANCE.

PERSONAL INSURANCE USES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIMITS CAPACITY OR TO REDUCE RETENTIONS ON AN INDIVIDUAL RISK BASIS. PERSONAL INSURANCE ISSUES UMBRELLA POLICIES UP TO A MAXIMUM

LIMIT OF $10.0 MILLION PER RISK. PERSONAL INSURANCE MAY ALSO RETAIN AMOUNTS GREATER THAN THOSE DESCRIBED HEREIN BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RISK.

COMPETITION

ALTHOUGH NATIONAL COMPANIES WRITE THE MAJORITY OF THIS BUSINESS, PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM MANY REGIONAL AND HUNDREDS OF

LOCAL COMPANIES. PERSONAL INSURANCE PRIMARILY COMPETES BASED ON BREADTH OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PRICE, SERVICE (INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING), EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, STABILITY OF THE INSURER AND NAME

RECOGNITION. PERSONAL INSURANCE COMPETES FOR BUSINESS WITHIN EACH INDEPENDENT AGENCY SINCE THESE AGENCIES ALSO OFFER POLICIES OF COMPETING COMPANIES. AT THE AGENCY LEVEL, COMPETITION IS PRIMARILY

BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE (INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING), THE LEVEL OF AUTOMATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIVIDUAL AGENTS. IN RECENT YEARS, MOST INDEPENDENT PERSONAL INSURANCE

AGENTS HAVE BEGUN UTILIZING PRICE COMPARISON RATING TECHNOLOGY, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS "COMPARATIVE RATERS," AS A COST-EFFICIENT MEANS OF OBTAINING QUOTES FROM MULTIPLE COMPANIES. BECAUSE THE USE OF

THIS TECHNOLOGY FACILITATES THE PROCESS OF GENERATING MULTIPLE QUOTES, THE TECHNOLOGY HAS INCREASED PRICE COMPARISON ON NEW BUSINESS AND, INCREASINGLY, ON RENEWAL BUSINESS. PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO

COMPETES WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT USE EXCLUSIVE AGENTS OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THOSE THAT EMPLOY DIRECT MARKETING STRATEGIES. SEE "ITEM 1ARISK

FACTORSTHE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE, AND THE IMPACT OF INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE

OPERATE, COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY."

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY'S CLAIM FUNCTIONS ARE MANAGED THROUGH ITS CLAIMS SERVICES ORGANIZATION, WITH LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE OTHER

COUNTRIES WHERE IT DOES BUSINESS. WITH MORE THAN 12,000 EMPLOYEES, CLAIMS SERVICES EMPLOYS A GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS WITH DIVERSE SKILLS, INCLUDING CLAIM

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADJUSTERS,

APPRAISERS, ATTORNEYS, INVESTIGATORS, ENGINEERS, ACCOUNTANTS, NURSES, SYSTEM SPECIALISTS AND TRAINING, MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL. APPROVED EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS

INVESTIGATORS, ATTORNEYS AND, IN THE RARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN NECESSARY, INDEPENDENT ADJUSTERS AND APPRAISERS, ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE AS APPROPRIATE.

UNITED

STATES FIELD CLAIM MANAGEMENT TEAMS LOCATED IN 21 CLAIM CENTERS AND 53 SATELLITE AND SPECIALTY-ONLY OFFICES IN 45 STATES ARE ORGANIZED TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC CLAIM

CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE TO THE BUSINESSES WITHIN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS SEGMENTS. CLAIM TEAMS WITH SPECIALIZED SKILLS, REQUIRED LICENSES, RESOURCES AND WORKFLOWS ARE MATCHED TO THE UNIQUE EXPOSURES OF

THOSE BUSINESSES, WITH LOCAL CLAIMS MANAGEMENT DEDICATED TO ACHIEVING OPTIMAL RESULTS WITHIN EACH SEGMENT. THE COMPANY'S HOME OFFICE OPERATIONS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF WORKFLOW

DESIGN, QUALITY MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCED MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS, TRAINING, FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONTROL, AND HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY. THIS STRUCTURE PERMITS

THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF A LARGE, ESTABLISHED COMPANY WHILE RETAINING THE AGILITY TO RESPOND PROMPTLY TO THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS, BROKERS, AGENTS AND UNDERWRITERS. CLAIMS

MANAGEMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL, WHILE GENERALLY PROVIDED LOCALLY BY STAFF IN THE RESPECTIVE INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS DUE TO LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IS ALSO MANAGED BY THE

COMPANY'S CLAIMS SERVICES ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITES STATES TO LEVERAGE THAT KNOWLEDGE BASE AND TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES.

AN

INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY TO BENEFIT CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS IS ITS CONTINUING INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INSURANCE FRAUD THROUGH ITS INVESTIGATIVE

SERVICES UNIT. THE COMPANY HAS A NATIONWIDE STAFF OF EXPERTS WHO INVESTIGATE A WIDE ARRAY OF INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEMES USING IN-HOUSE FORENSIC RESOURCES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS. THIS STAFF ALSO

HAS SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE IN FIRE SCENE EXAMINATIONS, MEDICAL PROVIDER FRAUD SCHEMES AND DATA MINING. THE COMPANY ALSO DEDICATES INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT VIOLATIONS OF LAW ARE REPORTED

TO AND PROSECUTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

CLAIMS

SERVICES USES TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS TO ASSIST THE COMPANY IN REVIEWING ITS CLAIM PRACTICES AND RESULTS IN ORDER TO EVALUATE AND IMPROVE ITS CLAIMS

MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON SEGMENTATION OF CLAIMS AND APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL SPECIALIZATION TO DRIVE EFFECTIVE CLAIM RESOLUTION. THE COMPANY

CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS INVESTMENT IN CLAIM RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE FOCUS ON CLAIM OUTCOMES AND A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT. THE COMPANY OPERATES A STATE-OF-THE-ART

CLAIMS TRAINING FACILITY WHICH OFFERS HANDS-ON EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING TO HELP ENSURE THAT ITS CLAIM PROFESSIONALS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED. IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL

RESOURCES IN MANY OF ITS CLAIM HANDLING OPERATIONS AND ROUTINELY MONITORS THE EFFECT OF THOSE INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE A CONSISTENT OPTIMIZATION AMONG OUTCOMES, COST AND SERVICE.

CLAIMS

SERVICES' CATASTROPHE RESPONSE STRATEGY IS TO RESPOND TO A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHIC EVENT USING ITS OWN PERSONNEL, ENABLING IT TO MINIMIZE RELIANCE ON INDEPENDENT ADJUSTERS AND

APPRAISERS. THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED A LARGE DEDICATED CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM AND TRAINED A LARGE ENTERPRISE RESPONSE TEAM OF EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHO CAN BE DEPLOYED ON SHORT NOTICE IN THE EVENT OF

A CATASTROPHE THAT GENERATES CLAIM VOLUME EXCEEDING THE CAPACITY OF THE DEDICATED CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM. IN RECENT YEARS, THESE INTERNAL RESOURCES WERE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED TO RESPOND TO A RECORD

NUMBER OF CATASTROPHE CLAIMS.

REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY REINSURES A PORTION OF THE RISKS IT UNDERWRITES IN ORDER TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES AND TO PROTECT ITS CAPITAL. THE COMPANY

CEDES TO REINSURERS A PORTION OF THESE RISKS AND PAYS PREMIUMS BASED UPON THE RISK AND EXPOSURE OF THE POLICIES SUBJECT TO SUCH REINSURANCE. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS TO

MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LARGE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY LOSSES, INCLUDING CATASTROPHE, TREATY, FACULTATIVE AND QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE. CEDED REINSURANCE

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVOLVES

CREDIT RISK, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS, AND IS PREDOMINANTLY SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF

THE REINSURANCE CEDED, THE COMPANY REMAINS LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED AFTER REDUCTIONS FOR KNOWN INSOLVENCIES AND AFTER ALLOWANCES FOR

UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS COLLATERAL, INCLUDING TRUST AGREEMENTS, ESCROW FUNDS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, UNDER CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF REINSURERS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND REVIEWS ITS REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS PERIODICALLY. REINSURERS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES, THE PRICE OF THEIR

PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL PROVIDED. AFTER REINSURANCE IS PURCHASED, THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED ABILITY TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK TO A REINSURER. IN ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF

JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A

COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY.

FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING REINSURANCE, SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS." FOR A DESCRIPTION OF

REINSURANCE-RELATED LITIGATION, SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY A VARIETY OF EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HURRICANES, TORNADOES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL,

WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS, VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND OTHER NATURALLY-OCCURRING EVENTS, SUCH AS SOLAR FLARES. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO RESULT FROM TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER

INTENTIONALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTS INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING

NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, CYBER-ATTACKS, EXPLOSIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A

CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS;

HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO

CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SUMMARIZES THE COMPANY'S CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE AT JANUARY 1,

2017.

CORPORATE CATASTROPHE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATY.

THIS TREATY COVERS THE ACCUMULATION OF CERTAIN PROPERTY LOSSES ARISING FROM ONE

OR MULTIPLE

OCCURRENCES FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2017 THROUGH AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2017: 75% ($1.5 BILLION) OF QUALIFYING LOSSES COVERED BY THE TREATY AND 25% ($500 MILLION) OF

QUALIFYING LOSSES RETAINED BY THE COMPANY PART OF $2.0 BILLION EXCESS OF $3.0 BILLION. QUALIFYING LOSSES FOR EACH OCCURRENCE ARE AFTER A $100 MILLION DEDUCTIBLE. THE TREATY COVERS

ALL OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA AND THEIR TERRITORIES AND POSSESSIONS, THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS, MEXICO AND ALL WATERS CONTIGUOUS THERETO. THE TREATY ONLY PROVIDES COVERAGE

FOR TERRORISM EVENTS IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXCLUDES ENTIRELY LOSSES ARISING FROM NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL ATTACKS.

CATASTROPHE BONDS.

THE COMPANY HAS CATASTROPHE PROTECTION THROUGH AN INDEMNITY REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH LONG POINT RE III LTD.

(LONG POINT

RE III), AN INDEPENDENT CAYMAN ISLANDS COMPANY LICENSED AS A CLASS C INSURER IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS. THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT EXPIRES IN MAY 2018 AND MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR

AS REINSURANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE FOR REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT, LONG POINT RE III ISSUED NOTES (GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS "CATASTROPHE BONDS") TO

INVESTORS IN AMOUNTS EQUAL TO THE FULL COVERAGE PROVIDED UNDER THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE PROCEEDS WERE DEPOSITED IN A REINSURANCE TRUST ACCOUNT. THE BUSINESSES COVERED BY THIS

REINSURANCE AGREEMENT ARE SUBSETS OF THE COMPANY'S OVERALL INSURANCE PORTFOLIO, COMPRISING SPECIFIED PROPERTY COVERAGES SPREAD ACROSS THE FOLLOWING GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS: CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE,

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, MAINE, MARYLAND, MASSACHUSETTS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, PENNSYLVANIA, RHODE ISLAND, VIRGINIA AND VERMONT.

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH LONG POINT RE III PROVIDES COVERAGE OF UP TO $300 MILLION TO THE COMPANY FOR LOSSES FROM TROPICAL CYCLONES, EARTHQUAKES,

SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OR WINTER STORMS IN THE LOCATIONS LISTED ABOVE. THE ATTACHMENT POINT AND MAXIMUM LIMIT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE RESET ANNUALLY TO ADJUST THE EXPECTED LOSS OF THE LAYER WITHIN A

PREDETERMINED RANGE. FOR THE PERIOD MAY 16, 2016 THROUGH AND INCLUDING MAY 15, 2017, THE COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO BEGIN RECOVERING AMOUNTS UNDER THIS REINSURANCE AGREEMENT IF THE COVERED

LOSSES IN THE COVERED AREA FOR A SINGLE OCCURRENCE REACH AN INITIAL ATTACHMENT AMOUNT OF $1.968 BILLION. THE FULL $300 MILLION COVERAGE AMOUNT IS AVAILABLE ON A PROPORTIONAL BASIS UNTIL

SUCH COVERED LOSSES REACH A MAXIMUM $2.468 BILLION. THE COVERAGE UNDER THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO SPECIFIED PROPERTY COVERAGE WRITTEN IN PERSONAL INSURANCE; SELECT ACCOUNTS, MIDDLE

MARKET (EXCLUDING EXCESS CASUALTY), FIRST PARTY (EXCLUDING BOILER & MACHINERY) AND SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION IN BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE; AND BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE OTHER

IN BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE.

UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY ANNUAL REINSURANCE PREMIUMS TO LONG POINT RE III FOR THE REINSURANCE COVERAGE. AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THE

COMPANY UNDER THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY COVERED EVENT CANNOT EXCEED THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL LOSSES FROM SUCH EVENT. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE CATASTROPHE BONDS WILL BE REDUCED BY

ANY AMOUNTS PAID TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT.

AS

WITH ANY REINSURANCE AGREEMENT, THERE IS CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTING AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS. WITH REGARD TO LONG POINT RE III, THE CREDIT RISK IS MITIGATED BY A

REINSURANCE TRUST ACCOUNT THAT HAS BEEN FUNDED BY LONG POINT RE III WITH MONEY MARKET FUNDS THAT INVEST SOLELY IN DIRECT GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS BACKED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH

MATURITIES OF NO MORE THAN 13 MONTHS. THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS MUST HAVE A PRINCIPAL STABILITY RATING OF AT LEAST AAAM BY STANDARD & POOR'S ON THE ISSUANCE DATE OF THE BONDS AND THEREAFTER

MUST BE RATED BY STANDARD & POOR'S. OTHER PERMISSIBLE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MONEY MARKET FUNDS WHICH INVEST IN REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY DIRECT GOVERNMENT

OBLIGATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS OF ANY AGENCY BACKED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH TERMS OF NO MORE THAN 397 CALENDAR DAYS, AND CASH.

AT

THE TIME THE AGREEMENT WAS ENTERED INTO WITH LONG POINT RE III, THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT ADDRESSES VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES OR VIES.

UNDER THIS GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY THAT IS FORMED FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES IS CONSIDERED A VIE IF: (A) THE EQUITY INVESTORS LACK THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT ABILITY THROUGH VOTING RIGHTS OR SIMILAR RIGHTS

TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT AN ENTITY'S ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENTITY'S OPERATIONS, OR (B) THE EQUITY INVESTORS DO NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR THE

ENTITY TO SUPPORT ITS ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONALLY, A COMPANY THAT ABSORBS A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES FROM A VIE'S ACTIVITIES OR IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE ENTITY'S EXPECTED RESIDUAL

RETURNS, OR BOTH, IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE VIE AND IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS

A RESULT OF THE EVALUATION OF THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH LONG POINT RE III, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS A VIE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN ITEMS (A) AND

(B) ABOVE WERE PRESENT. HOWEVER, WHILE LONG POINT RE III WAS DETERMINED TO BE A VIE, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT IT DID NOT HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST IN THE ENTITY, AS THE VARIABILITY IN ITS

RESULTS, CAUSED BY THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT, IS EXPECTED TO BE ABSORBED ENTIRELY BY THE INVESTORS IN THE CATASTROPHE BONDS ISSUED BY LONG POINT RE III AND RESIDUAL AMOUNTS EARNED

BY IT, IF ANY, ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABSORBED BY THE EQUITY INVESTORS (THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER AN EQUITY NOR A RESIDUAL INTEREST IN LONG POINT RE III).

ACCORDINGLY,

THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF LONG POINT RE III AND DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THAT ENTITY IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY,

BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NO INTENTION TO PURSUE ANY TRANSACTION THAT WOULD RESULT IN IT ACQUIRING INTEREST IN AND BECOMING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF LONG POINT RE III, THE CONSOLIDATION OF THAT ENTITY

IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS IS UNLIKELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY HAS NOT INCURRED ANY LOSSES THAT HAVE RESULTED OR ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A RECOVERY UNDER THE LONG POINT RE III AGREEMENT SINCE ITS INCEPTION.

NORTHEAST PROPERTY CATASTROPHE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATY.

THIS TREATY PROVIDES UP TO $800 MILLION PART OF $850 MILLION

2016), UP TO C$200 MILLION (US$149 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016) AND FOR 100% OF LOSSES IN EXCESS OF C$200 MILLION (US$149 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016), UP

TO C$600 MILLION (US$446 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016).

OTHER INTERNATIONAL REINSURANCE TREATIES.

FOR OTHER BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN CANADA, AS WELL AS FOR BUSINESS WRITTEN IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, THE

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, BRAZIL AND IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S, SEPARATE REINSURANCE PROTECTIONS ARE PURCHASED LOCALLY THAT HAVE LOWER NET RETENTIONS MORE COMMENSURATE WITH THE SIZE OF THE

RESPECTIVE LOCAL BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY

CONDUCTS AN ONGOING REVIEW OF ITS RISK AND CATASTROPHE COVERAGES AND MAKES CHANGES AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM.

THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE

TREASURY AUTHORIZED

THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2020 THAT PROVIDES FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION

OF THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IN 2017, SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR

CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS RESERVE ESTIMATES AS PART OF A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS THAT INCLUDES REVIEW OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS, UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE.

THE COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, THE COMPANY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED

RECOVERIES FOR REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION. THE RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING

RESERVES AND A DISCUSSION OF UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND RISK FACTORS, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES."

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES (DISCUSSED BY PRODUCT LINE IN THE "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES" SECTION OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS") ARE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS

CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, INFLATION, JUDICIAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF

THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE

UNDERLYING INSURANCE CONTRACT (E.G., CLAIMS-MADE VERSUS OCCURRENCE), CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF THE OCCURRENCE

DATE FOR A CLAIM, AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INSURED EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

THE

COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES FOR UNREPORTED CLAIMS AND DEVELOPMENT WITH RESPECT TO REPORTED CLAIMS PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT BY

ACCIDENT YEAR FOR EACH TYPE OF EXPOSURE AND BUSINESS UNIT. SIMILARLY, THE COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES OF UNPAID LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT

PATTERNS OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO LOSSES FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AND TYPE OF EXPOSURE. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY'S RESERVING METHODS FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION," AND

"ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION."

CERTAIN

OF THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT VALUE. SEE NOTE 7 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION.

RESERVES ON STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014, CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (NET OF REINSURANCE) PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP RESERVES) WERE $44 MILLION HIGHER, $41 MILLION HIGHER AND $29 MILLION HIGHER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN THOSE REPORTED IN THE COMPANY'S

RESPECTIVE ANNUAL REPORTS FILED WITH INSURANCE REGULATORS, WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES (STATUTORY RESERVES).

THE

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GAAP AND STATUTORY RESERVES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN GAAP AND STATUTORY ACCOUNTING FOR TWO ITEMS: (1) FEES ASSOCIATED WITH BILLING OF

REQUIRED REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER LARGE DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS, AND (2) THE ACCOUNTING FOR RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE. FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY PAYS THE DEDUCTIBLE PORTION OF A CASUALTY

INSURANCE CLAIM AND THEN SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE INSURED, PLUS A FEE. THIS FEE IS REPORTED AS FEE INCOME FOR GAAP REPORTING, BUT AS AN OFFSET TO CLAIM EXPENSES PAID FOR STATUTORY REPORTING.

RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES RESULT FROM REINSURANCE PLACED TO COVER LOSSES ON INSURED EVENTS OCCURRING PRIOR TO THE

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCEPTION

OF A REINSURANCE CONTRACT. FOR GAAP REPORTING, RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES ARE INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND RESULT IN LOWER NET RESERVE AMOUNTS. STATUTORY ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES REQUIRE RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES TO BE RECORDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES AS CONTRA-LIABILITIES RATHER THAN IN LOSS RESERVES.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS ARE SEGREGATED FROM OTHER CLAIMS AND ARE HANDLED SEPARATELY BY THE COMPANY'S SPECIAL LIABILITY GROUP, A

SEPARATE UNIT STAFFED BY DEDICATED LEGAL, CLAIM, FINANCE AND ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION."

INTERCOMPANY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

MOST OF THE COMPANY'S DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE MEMBERS OF AN INTERCOMPANY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENT.

POOLING ARRANGEMENTS PERMIT THE PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO RELY ON THE CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE POOL'S STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS RATHER THAN JUST ON ITS OWN STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. UNDER SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS, THE MEMBERS SHARE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INSURANCE BUSINESS THAT IS WRITTEN AND ALLOCATE THE COMBINED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES.

RATINGS

RATINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ASSESSING THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES RATINGS FROM THE

FOLLOWING MAJOR RATING AGENCIES: A.M. BEST COMPANY (A.M. BEST), FITCH RATINGS (FITCH), MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODY'S) AND STANDARD & POOR'S CORP. (S&P). RATING AGENCIES TYPICALLY

ISSUE TWO TYPES OF RATINGS FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES.

CLAIMS-PAYING (OR FINANCIAL STRENGTH) RATINGS, WHICH REFLECT THE RATING AGENCY'S ASSESSMENT OF AN INSURER'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS, AND DEBT RATINGS, WHICH REFLECT

THE RATING AGENCY'S ASSESSMENT OF A COMPANY'S PROSPECTS FOR REPAYING ITS DEBTS AND ARE CONSIDERED BY LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTING OF INTEREST RATES AND TERMS FOR A COMPANY'S SHORT- AND

LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. AGENCY RATINGS ARE NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY, SELL OR HOLD ANY SECURITY, AND THEY MAY BE REVISED OR WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME BY THE RATING AGENCY. EACH AGENCY'S RATING SHOULD BE

EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER AGENCY'S RATING. THE SYSTEM AND THE NUMBER OF RATING CATEGORIES CAN VARY WIDELY FROM RATING AGENCY TO RATING AGENCY. CUSTOMERS USUALLY FOCUS ON CLAIMS-PAYING

RATINGS, WHILE CREDITORS FOCUS ON DEBT RATINGS. INVESTORS USE BOTH TO EVALUATE A COMPANY'S OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH. THE RATINGS ISSUED ON THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES BY ANY OF THESE AGENCIES

ARE ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY AND ARE AVAILABLE ON THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE AND FROM THE AGENCIES.

A

DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS VOLUMES AND COMPETITIVE POSITION BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS

PRODUCTS MAY BE REDUCED, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE SOME CUSTOMERS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATINGS TO ENTER INTO, MAINTAIN OR RENEW BUSINESS WITH IT.

ADDITIONALLY,

A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS, INCLUDING IN

THE SYNDICATED BANK LOAN MARKET, AND/OR RESULT IN HIGHER FINANCING COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, DOWNGRADES IN THE COMPANY'S DEBT RATINGS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER THE COMPANY'S REVOLVING

CREDIT AGREEMENT (UNDER WHICH THE COST OF BORROWING COULD RANGE FROM LIBOR PLUS 87.5 BASIS POINTS TO LIBOR PLUS 150 BASIS POINTS, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S DEBT RATINGS), THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL

PAPER PROGRAM, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY WERE TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS BY ISSUING DEBT OR SIMILAR TYPES OF SECURITIES. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVOLVING

CREDIT AGREEMENT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE LEVEL OF INCREASED CASH FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE AS PART OF THE EVALUATION OF THE

COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT A ONE- TO TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN ITS DEBT RATINGS WOULD NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER ITS EXISTING

CREDIT AGREEMENT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE AS PART OF THE EVALUATION OF ITS COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES.

RATING AGENCY ACTIONS

THE FOLLOWING RATING AGENCY ACTIONS WERE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY FROM FEBRUARY 11, 2016, THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY FILED

ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, THROUGH FEBRUARY 16, 2017.



ON JULY 22, 2016, A.M. BEST AFFIRMED ALL RATINGS OF THE COMPANY, EXCEPT RATINGS FOR TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED, WHICH

WERE AFFIRMED ON DECEMBER 23, 2016. THE OUTLOOK FOR ALL RATINGS IS STABLE.



ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2016, FITCH AFFIRMED ALL RATINGS OF THE COMPANY. THE OUTLOOK FOR ALL RATINGS IS STABLE.

INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

THE MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID, TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT,

TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL AND TAXABLE CORPORATE AND U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT

PURCHASES AND SALES ARE EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY ITS INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. GENERALLY, THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS PRODUCED

BY THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO ADEQUATELY FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE RESERVES. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT OF THE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO,

INCLUDING ITS USE OF TREASURY FUTURES AT TIMES, HAS PRODUCED A DURATION THAT IS LESS THAN THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES. THE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT BY WHICH THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS,

CONTRIBUTES TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUND CLAIM PAYMENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO INVESTS MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES. THESE

INVESTMENT CLASSES

HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT ALSO INVOLVE VARYING DEGREES OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND LESS LIQUIDITY.

REGULATION

U.S. STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION

TRV'S DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE COLLECTIVELY LICENSED TO TRANSACT INSURANCE BUSINESS IN ALL U.S. STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,

GUAM, PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE VARIOUS STATES AND JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY TRANSACT BUSINESS. THE EXTENT OF REGULATION VARIES, BUT GENERALLY

DERIVES FROM STATUTES THAT DELEGATE REGULATORY, SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO A DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN EACH STATE AND JURISDICTION. THE REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION

RELATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED, THE LICENSING OF INSURERS AND THEIR AGENTS, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS, PREMIUM RATES,

RESTRICTIONS ON THE SIZE OF RISKS THAT MAY BE INSURED UNDER A SINGLE POLICY, RESERVES AND PROVISIONS FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS, DEPOSITS OF SECURITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF

POLICYHOLDERS, APPROVAL OF POLICY FORMS AND THE REGULATION OF MARKET CONDUCT, INCLUDING THE USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION IN UNDERWRITING AS WELL AS OTHER UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PRACTICES. STATE

INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS ALSO CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND MARKET CONDUCT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND REQUIRE THE FILING OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER REPORTS ON A QUARTERLY AND

ANNUAL BASIS.

STATE

INSURANCE REGULATION CONTINUES TO EVOLVE IN RESPONSE TO THE CHANGING ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS EFFORTS BY REGULATORS INTERNATIONALLY TO DEVELOP A CONSISTENT

APPROACH TO REGULATION. WHILE THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT HISTORICALLY REGULATED THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2010 ESTABLISHED A

FEDERAL INSURANCE

OFFICE (FIO) WITHIN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. WHILE THE FIO HAS LIMITED REGULATORY AUTHORITY, IT HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN THE DISCUSSIONS TO DEVELOP INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY STANDARDS FOR THE

INSURANCE INDUSTRY. IN RESPONSE TO THESE INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS, THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS, THROUGH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC), ARE WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE

AND THE FIO TO CONSIDER AND DEVELOP CHANGES TO THE U.S. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.

THESE

CHANGES ARE EVIDENCED BY THE INCORPORATION OF SUPERVISORY COLLEGES INTO THE U.S. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. A SUPERVISORY COLLEGE IS A FORUM OF THE REGULATORS HAVING JURISDICTIONAL

AUTHORITY OVER A HOLDING COMPANY'S VARIOUS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING FOREIGN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, CONVENED TO MEET WITH THE INSURER'S EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, TO EVALUATE THE INSURER FROM BOTH

A GROUP-WIDE AND LEGAL-ENTITY BASIS. SOME OF THE ITEMS EVALUATED DURING THE COLLEGES INCLUDE THE INSURER'S BUSINESS STRATEGIES, ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

WHILE

INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES IS REGULATED ON A LEGAL-ENTITY BASIS, THE NAIC HAS ADOPTED CHANGES TO ITS MODEL HOLDING COMPANY ACT THAT SOME STATES, INCLUDING THE STATE OF

CONNECTICUT, HAVE ENACTED TO ALLOW THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO BE DESIGNATED AS THE GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISOR (I.E., LEAD REGULATOR) FOR THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM BASED UPON CERTAIN

CRITERIA, INCLUDING THE PLACE OF DOMICILE OF THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HOLDING THE MAJORITY OF THE INSURANCE GROUP'S PREMIUMS, ASSETS, OR LIABILITIES. BASED UPON THESE CRITERIA, THE STATE OF

CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT IS DESIGNATED AS TRV'S LEAD REGULATOR AND CONDUCTS THE SUPERVISORY COLLEGES FOR THE COMPANY.

INSURANCE REGULATION CONCERNING DIVIDENDS FROM INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.

TRV'S PRINCIPAL DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN

THE STATE OF

CONNECTICUT. THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS REQUIRE NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND FROM AN INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARY THAT, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY'S STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING

DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY'S NET INCOME FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES AND BY STATE REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH TRV'S DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE

RESTRICTIVE, LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

RATE AND RULE APPROVALS.

TRV'S DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO EACH STATE'S LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING RATE AND RULE

APPROVALS.

THE APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GENERALLY ESTABLISH STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT RATES ARE NOT EXCESSIVE, INADEQUATE, UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY OR USED TO ENGAGE IN UNFAIR PRICE COMPETITION. AN

INSURER'S ABILITY TO ADJUST RATES AND THE RELATIVE TIMING OF THE PROCESS ARE DEPENDENT UPON EACH STATE'S REQUIREMENTS. MANY STATES HAVE ENACTED VARIATIONS OF COMPETITIVE RATEMAKING LAWS, WHICH ALLOW

INSURERS TO SET CERTAIN PREMIUM RATES FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF INSURANCE WITHOUT HAVING TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXITING GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS AND/OR CANCELING OR NONRENEWING POLICIES.

SEVERAL STATES HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH

MAY IMPACT THE

TIMING AND/OR THE ABILITY OF AN INSURER TO EITHER DISCONTINUE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE ITS WRITINGS IN THAT STATE. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TYPICALLY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE, AND IN SOME INSTANCES

INSURANCE DEPARTMENT APPROVAL, PRIOR TO DISCONTINUING A LINE OF BUSINESS OR WITHDRAWING FROM THAT STATE, AND THEY ALLOW INSURERS TO CANCEL OR NON-RENEW CERTAIN POLICIES ONLY FOR CERTAIN SPECIFIED

REASONS.

ASSESSMENTS FOR GUARANTY FUNDS AND SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY ASSIGNED RISK AND REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS.

VIRTUALLY ALL

STATES REQUIRE

INSURERS LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS IN THEIR STATE, INCLUDING TRV'S DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, TO BEAR A PORTION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED BY SOME CLAIMANTS BECAUSE OF THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURERS.

MANY STATES ALSO HAVE LAWS THAT ESTABLISH SECOND-INJURY FUNDS TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO INJURED EMPLOYEES FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRIOR CONDITION OR INJURY.

TRV'S

DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNED RISK POOLS, PRINCIPALLY INVOLVING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE,

PROPERTY WINDPOOLS IN STATES PRONE TO PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM HURRICANES AND FAIR PLANS, AS WELL AS AUTOMOBILE ASSIGNED RISK PLANS THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE NOT POOLED WITH OTHER CARRIERS, WHICH PROVIDE

VARIOUS INSURANCE COVERAGES TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE THAT COVERAGE IN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET.

ASSESSMENTS

MAY INCLUDE ANY CHARGE MANDATED BY STATUTE OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY THAT IS RELATED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES. EXAMPLES OF SUCH MECHANISMS INCLUDE, BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND, FLORIDA CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION, NATIONAL WORKERS' COMPENSATION REINSURANCE POOL, VARIOUS WORKERS' COMPENSATION RELATED

FUNDS (E.G., THE FLORIDA SPECIAL DISABILITY TRUST), NORTH CAROLINA BEACH PLAN, LOUISIANA CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION, AND THE TEXAS WINDSTORM INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. AMOUNTS PAYABLE

OR PAID AS A RESULT OF ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE IN SUBSTANCE REINSURANCE, INCLUDING CERTAIN INVOLUNTARY POOLS WHERE INSURERS ARE REQUIRED TO ASSUME PREMIUMS AND LOSSES FROM THOSE POOLS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

AS REINSURANCE (E.G., NATIONAL WORKERS' COMPENSATION REINSURANCE POOL, NORTH CAROLINA BEACH PLAN). AMOUNTS RELATED TO ASSESSMENTS FROM ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE NOT REINSURANCE ARE REPORTED AS A

COMPONENT OF "GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES," SUCH AS THE FLORIDA SPECIAL DISABILITY TRUST. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

CONCERNING ASSESSMENTS FOR GUARANTY FUNDS AND SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY ASSIGNED RISK AND REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS INCLUDING STATE-FUNDING MECHANISMS, SEE "ITEM 1ARISK

FACTORS."

INSURANCE REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM.

THE NAIC DEVELOPED THE INSURANCE REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM (IRIS) TO HELP STATE REGULATORS

IDENTIFY

COMPANIES THAT MAY REQUIRE REGULATORY ATTENTION. FINANCIAL EXAMINERS REVIEW ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RESULTS OF KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS BASED ON YEAR-END DATA WITH THE GOAL OF IDENTIFYING

INSURERS THAT APPEAR TO REQUIRE IMMEDIATE REGULATORY ATTENTION. EACH RATIO HAS AN ESTABLISHED "USUAL RANGE" OF RESULTS. A RATIO RESULT FALLING

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUTSIDE

THE USUAL RANGE, HOWEVER, IS NOT NECESSARILY CONSIDERED ADVERSE; RATHER, UNUSUAL VALUES ARE USED AS PART OF THE REGULATORY EARLY MONITORING SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, IN SOME YEARS, IT MAY NOT BE

UNUSUAL FOR FINANCIALLY SOUND COMPANIES TO HAVE SEVERAL RATIOS WITH RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES. GENERALLY, AN INSURANCE COMPANY MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY OR, DEPENDING ON THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, REGULATORY ACTION IF CERTAIN OF ITS KEY IRIS RATIOS FALL OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES AND THE INSURER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION IS TRENDING DOWNWARD.

BASED

ON PRELIMINARY 2016 IRIS RATIOS CALCULATED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS LEAD DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE

IRIS RATIO DUE TO THE SIZE OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES, WHILE TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY AND ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS

OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE IRIS RATIO DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. IN 2015, THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY AND TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY HAD

RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THESE SAME RATIOS.

MANAGEMENT

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE REGULATORY ACTION AS A RESULT OF THE 2016 IRIS RATIO RESULTS FOR THE LEAD INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. IN ALL INSTANCES IN PRIOR

YEARS, REGULATORS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED UPON FOLLOW-UP THAT NO REGULATORY ACTION WAS REQUIRED.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC) REQUIREMENTS.

THE NAIC HAS AN RBC REQUIREMENT WHICH SETS FORTH MINIMUM CAPITAL STANDARDS FOR MOST PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY

INSURANCE COMPANIES AND IS INTENDED TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THESE NAIC RBC REQUIREMENTS BASED ON LAWS

THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES. THESE REQUIREMENTS SUBJECT INSURERS HAVING POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED BY THE RBC

CALCULATION TO VARYING DEGREES OF REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL INADEQUACY. EACH OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS AT DECEMBER 31,

2016 SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE LEVEL AT WHICH ANY RBC REGULATORY ACTION WOULD OCCUR.

WHILE

THERE IS CURRENTLY NO GROUP REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, A COMPARISON OF AN INSURER'S POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS ON A COMBINED BASIS TO THE LEGAL ENTITY NAIC

RBC REQUIREMENTS ON A COMBINED BASIS CAN PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION REGARDING AN INSURANCE GROUP'S OVERALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY IN THE U.S. THE AMOUNT OF POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS HELD BY THE COMPANY'S U.S.

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 DETERMINED ON A COMBINED BASIS SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THE LEVEL AT WHICH THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO RBC REGULATORY ACTION (COMPANY ACTION

LEVEL) ON A COMBINED BASIS AT THAT DATE.

THE

FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE AMONG ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH LEVELS OF CAPITAL ABOVE THE RBC REQUIREMENT. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE

AND INEFFECTIVE TO USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES.

INVESTMENT REGULATION.

INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTMENTS MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH PRESCRIBE THE KIND, QUALITY

AND

CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS. IN GENERAL, THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERMIT INVESTMENTS IN FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS, CORPORATE BONDS, PREFERRED AND COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES, MORTGAGE

LOANS, REAL ESTATE AND CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENTS, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED LIMITS AND CERTAIN OTHER QUALIFICATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES BASED IN CANADA, AND THE CANADIAN BRANCH OF ONE OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, ARE REGULATED FOR

SOLVENCY PURPOSES BY THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (OSFI) UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT (CANADA). THESE CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES AND THE CANADIAN BRANCH

ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CANADIAN PROVINCIAL AND TERRITORIAL

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSURANCE

LEGISLATION WHICH REGULATES MARKET CONDUCT, INCLUDING PRICING, UNDERWRITING, COVERAGE AND CLAIM CONDUCT, IN VARYING DEGREES BY PROVINCE/TERRITORY AND BY PRODUCT LINE.

TRV'S

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES BASED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE REGULATED BY TWO REGULATORY BODIES, THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY (PRA) AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (FCA). THE

PRA'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO PROMOTE THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF INSURERS FOR THE PROTECTION OF POLICYHOLDERS, WHILE THE FCA HAS THREE OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES: (I) TO SECURE AN APPROPRIATE

DEGREE OF PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS, (II) TO PROTECT AND ENHANCE THE INTEGRITY OF THE UK FINANCIAL SYSTEM, AND (III) TO PROMOTE EFFECTIVE COMPETITION IN THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS. TRV'S

INSURANCE OPERATIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE IRISH BRANCH OF TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED WHICH IS SUPERVISED BY THE INSURANCE SUPERVISION DEPARTMENTS OF THE

CENTRAL BANK OF IRELAND (AS TO CONDUCT) AND ALSO BY THE PRA.

TRV'S

MANAGING AGENCY (TRAVELERS SYNDICATE MANAGEMENT LIMITED) (TSML) OF ITS LLOYD'S SYNDICATE (SYNDICATE 5000) IS ALSO REGULATED BY THE PRA AND THE FCA, WHICH HAVE DELEGATED CERTAIN

REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE COUNCIL OF LLOYD'S. TRAVELERS SYNDICATE 5000 IS ABLE TO WRITE BUSINESS IN OVER 75 JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BY VIRTUE OF LLOYD'S INTERNATIONAL LICENSES. IN

EACH SUCH JURISDICTION, THE POLICIES WRITTEN BY TSML, AS PART OF LLOYD'S, ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND INSURANCE REGULATIONS OF THAT JURISDICTION. TRAVELERS UNDERWRITING AGENCY LIMITED, WHICH AS AN

INSURANCE INTERMEDIARY IS REGULATED BY THE FCA, PRODUCES INSURANCE BUSINESS FOR TRAVELERS SYNDICATE 5000.

A

TRV SUBSIDIARY, TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY, HAS A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN CHINA. THE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IS REGULATED BY THE CHINA INSURANCE REGULATORY COMMISSION. A TRV

SUBSIDIARY, TCI GLOBAL SERVICES, INC., HAS A LIAISON OFFICE IN INDIA. INSURANCE BUSINESS IN INDIA IS REGULATED BY THE INSURANCE REGULATORY AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. TRV'S BRAZILIAN OPERATIONS

ARE REGULATED BY THE SUPERINTENDENCIA DE SEGUROS PRIVADOS (SUSEP).

REGULATORS

IN THESE JURISDICTIONS REQUIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVELS OF CAPITAL DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSURANCE POLICIES IN FORCE.

EACH OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD CAPITAL ABOVE THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016.

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, TRV IS NOT REGULATED AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. HOWEVER, SINCE TRV OWNS CAPITAL STOCK IN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, IT IS

SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER LAWS, OF EACH OF ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES' STATES OF DOMICILE. ALL HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS OTHER LAWS,

REQUIRE DISCLOSURE AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, PRIOR APPROVAL OF MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND AN AFFILIATE. THE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES AND OTHER LAWS ALSO REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PRIOR APPROVAL OF AN ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF A DOMESTIC INSURER, SOME TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AFFILIATES AND THE PAYMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS.

INSURANCE REGULATIONS CONCERNING CHANGE OF CONTROL.

MANY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY LAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE ADVANCE

APPROVAL BY STATE

AGENCIES OF ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT IS DOMICILED, OR, IN SOME CASES, HAVING SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS THAT IT IS DEEMED TO BE COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED, IN THAT STATE.

THE

LAWS OF MANY STATES ALSO CONTAIN PROVISIONS REQUIRING PRE-NOTIFICATION TO STATE AGENCIES PRIOR TO ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF A NON-DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY ADMITTED TO TRANSACT

BUSINESS IN THAT STATE. WHILE THESE PRE-NOTIFICATION STATUTES DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE STATE AGENCY TO DISAPPROVE THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, THEY DO AUTHORIZE ISSUANCE OF CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS WITH RESPECT

TO THE NON-DOMESTIC INSURER IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT SOME CONDITIONS, SUCH AS UNDUE MARKET CONCENTRATION, WOULD RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION.

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANY

TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF ANY OF TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD GENERALLY REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATES IN

WHICH THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED OR COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED. THEY MAY ALSO REQUIRE PRE-ACQUISITION NOTIFICATION IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED PRE-ACQUISITION NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS

AND IN WHICH SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ADMITTED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS.

TWO

OF TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND ITS OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S ARE DOMICILED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. INSURERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS,

INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE PRA AND FCA. TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DOMICILED IN, OR AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT

INSURANCE BUSINESS IN, CANADA ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING APPROVAL OF OSFI. TRV'S BRAZILIAN OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CHANGE OF CONTROL AND

OTHER SHARE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING APPROVAL OF SUSEP.

THESE

REQUIREMENTS MAY DETER, DELAY OR PREVENT TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING THE CONTROL OF OR THE OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO TRV'S

SHAREHOLDERS.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

FOR A DISCUSSION OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, SEE "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS" INCLUDING "CHANGES IN

FEDERAL REGULATION COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON US AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS" AND "REGULATORY CHANGES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN CANADA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION,

COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH."

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

AS A LARGE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE ENTERPRISE, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO MANY RISKS. THESE RISKS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTS

WITHIN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. SINCE CERTAIN RISKS CAN BE CORRELATED WITH OTHER RISKS, AN EVENT OR A SERIES OF EVENTS CAN IMPACT MULTIPLE AREAS OF THE COMPANY SIMULTANEOUSLY AND HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY. THESE EXPOSURES REQUIRE AN ENTITY-WIDE VIEW OF RISK AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON ALL ASPECTS OF

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MANAGE ITS RISK-TAKING TO BE WITHIN ITS RISK APPETITE IN A PRUDENT AND BALANCED EFFORT TO CREATE AND PRESERVE VALUE FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S

STAKEHOLDERS. THIS APPROACH TO COMPANY-WIDE RISK EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT IS COMMONLY CALLED ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM). ERM ACTIVITIES INVOLVE BOTH THE IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF A BROAD

RANGE OF RISKS AND THE EXECUTION OF SYNCHRONIZED STRATEGIES TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE SUCH RISKS. EFFECTIVE ERM ALSO INCLUDES THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANY'S RISK CAPITAL NEEDS, WHICH TAKES INTO

ACCOUNT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND CREDIT RATING CONSIDERATIONS, IN ADDITION TO ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.

ERM

AT THE COMPANY IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. ALL CORPORATE LEADERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE ENGAGED IN ERM. ERM INVOLVES RISK-BASED ANALYTICS, AS WELL AS

REPORTING AND FEEDBACK THROUGHOUT THE ENTERPRISE IN SUPPORT OF THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES.

THE

COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY AND THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER MODELING PROCESSES, TO MAKE UNDERWRITING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION TO CATASTROPHE MODELING AND ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY ALSO MODELS AND ANALYZES ITS EXPOSURE TO OTHER EXTREME EVENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES PROPRIETARY AND

THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER MODELING PROCESSES TO EVALUATE CAPITAL ADEQUACY. THESE ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES ARE AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THE COMPANY'S ERM PROCESS AND FURTHER SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM

FINANCIAL STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES.

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

ADDITION TO THE DAY-TO-DAY ERM ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS, KEY INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING COMMITTEES

(COMPRISED OF THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE OTHER MOST SENIOR MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT), THE ENTERPRISE AND BUSINESS RISK COMMITTEES OF MANAGEMENT, THE CREDIT COMMITTEE, CHIEF LEGAL

OFFICER, GENERAL COUNSEL, THE CHIEF ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE OFFICER, THE CORPORATE ACTUARIAL GROUP, THE CORPORATE AUDIT GROUP, THE CORPORATE CONTROLLER GROUP, THE ACCOUNTING POLICY GROUP AND THE

ENTERPRISE UNDERWRITING GROUP, AMONG OTHERS. A SENIOR EXECUTIVE TEAM COMPRISED OF THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF ERM, THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER AND THE CHIEF UNDERWRITING OFFICER OVERSEES THE

ERM PROCESS. THE MISSION OF THIS TEAM IS TO FACILITATE RISK ASSESSMENT AND TO COLLABORATE IN IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY. ANOTHER STRATEGIC ERM

OBJECTIVE OF THIS TEAM INCLUDES WORKING ACROSS THE COMPANY TO ENHANCE EFFECTIVE AND REALISTIC RISK MODELING CAPABILITIES AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S OVERALL EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE ITS PORTFOLIO

OF RISKS TO BE WITHIN ITS RISK APPETITE. BOARD OVERSIGHT OF ERM IS PROVIDED BY THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH REVIEWS THE STRATEGIES, PROCESSES AND CONTROLS PERTAINING TO THE

COMPANY'S INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND OVERSEES THE IMPLEMENTATION, EXECUTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY'S ERM PROGRAM.

THE

COMPANY'S ERM EFFORTS BUILD UPON THE FOUNDATION OF AN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT. ERM EXPANDS THE INTERNAL CONTROL OBJECTIVES OF EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT OPERATIONS,

RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, TO FOSTERING, LEADING AND SUPPORTING AN INTEGRATED, RISK-BASED CULTURE WITHIN THE COMPANY THAT FOCUSES ON VALUE

CREATION AND PRESERVATION. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF ANY RISK MANAGEMENT OR CONTROL SYSTEM

MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. AS A RESULT, THE POSSIBILITY OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS REMAINS IN SPITE OF THE

COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ERM EFFORTS. AN INVESTOR SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING THE DISCUSSIONS INCLUDED IN

"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS," "ITEM 7AQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK," AND "ITEM 8FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA."

OTHER INFORMATION

CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION

IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, NO MATERIAL PART OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS DEPENDENT UPON A SINGLE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED REVENUES.

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

A FORM OF EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE WHICH, SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIED LIMIT, INDEMNIFIES THE CEDING COMPANY FOR THE AMOUNT OF

LOSS IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED RETENTION WITH RESPECT TO AN ACCUMULATION OF LOSSES AND RELATED REINSURANCE REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS RESULTING FROM A CATASTROPHIC EVENT. THE ACTUAL REINSURANCE DOCUMENT IS CALLED A "CATASTROPHE COVER." THESE REINSURANCE

CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY DESIGNED TO COVER PROPERTY INSURANCE LOSSES BUT CAN BE WRITTEN TO COVER CASUALTY INSURANCE LOSSES SUCH AS FROM WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICIES.

COMBINED RATIO

FOR STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES (SAP), THE COMBINED RATIO IS THE SUM OF THE SAP LOSS AND LAE RATIO AND THE SAP UNDERWRITING EXPENSE

RATIO AS DEFINED IN THE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRED BY INSURANCE REGULATORS. THE COMBINED RATIO AS USED IN THIS REPORT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF, AND IS CALCULATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS, THE SAP COMBINED RATIO EXCEPT THAT THE SAP UNDERWRITING

EXPENSE RATIO IS BASED ON NET

WRITTEN

PREMIUM AND THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO AS USED IN THIS REPORT IS BASED ON NET

EARNED

PREMIUMS.

THE COMBINED RATIO IS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S UNDERWRITING DISCIPLINE, EFFICIENCY IN ACQUIRING AND SERVICING ITS

BUSINESS AND OVERALL UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY. A COMBINED RATIO UNDER 100% GENERALLY INDICATES AN UNDERWRITING PROFIT. A COMBINED RATIO OVER 100% GENERALLY INDICATES AN UNDERWRITING LOSS.

OTHER COMPANIES' METHOD OF COMPUTING A SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE COMPANY'S METHOD OF COMPUTING

THIS RATIO.

INVOLVES ANALYZING THE EXPOSURE AND CLAIM ACTIVITY AT AN INDIVIDUAL INSURED LEVEL AND THEN THROUGH THE USE OF DETERMINISTIC OR STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS AND/OR SIMULATIONS, ESTIMATING THE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR THOSE INSUREDS. THE TOTAL LOSSES FOR THE COHORT

ARE THEN THE SUM OF THE LOSSES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL INSURED.

IN PRACTICE, THE METHOD IS SOMETIMES SIMPLIFIED BY PERFORMING THE INDIVIDUAL INSURED ANALYSIS ONLY FOR THE LARGER INSUREDS,

WITH THE COSTS FOR THE SMALLER INSUREDS ESTIMATED VIA SAMPLING APPROACHES (EXTRAPOLATED TO THE REST OF THE SMALLER INSURED POPULATION) OR AGGREGATE APPROACHES (USING ASSUMPTIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE GROUND-UP LARGER INSURED ANALYSIS).

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO AND "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES."

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO

RAISE

CAPITAL AND THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE.

OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY

VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HURRICANES, TORNADOES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS, VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND OTHER

NATURALLY-OCCURRING EVENTS, SUCH AS SOLAR FLARES. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO BE MAN-MADE, SUCH AS TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER INTENTIONALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTS INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL,

CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, CYBER-ATTACKS, EXPLOSIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR BUSINESS SUBJECTS US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES AND

CANADA, WHICH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: HURRICANES FROM MAINE THROUGH TEXAS; TORNADOES AND HAIL STORMS THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL, MID-ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEASTERN REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES;

EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA, THE NEW MADRID REGION AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGION OF NORTH AMERICA; WILDFIRES, PARTICULARLY IN WESTERN STATES AND CANADA; AND TERRORISM IN MAJOR CITIES IN THE UNITED

STATES. IN ADDITION TO OUR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND BRAZIL AS

WELL AS TO A VARIETY OF WORLD-WIDE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES THROUGH OUR LLOYD'S OPERATIONS.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL AND MAN-MADE

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD INCREASE. SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES HAVE UNDERSCORED THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE CLIMATE TRENDS, AND POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD

ADD TO THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND CREATE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO FUTURE TRENDS AND EXPOSURES. FOR EXAMPLE, OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, HURRICANE ACTIVITY HAS IMPACTED

AREAS FURTHER INLAND THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED BY US, AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES HAVE RESULTED IN LARGER POPULATIONS IN COASTAL AREAS WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO SEVERE STORMS AND RELATED

STORM SURGE, THUS EXPANDING OUR POTENTIAL FOR LOSSES FROM HURRICANES. ADDITIONALLY, BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TORNADO AND HAIL STORMS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN MORE VOLATILE DURING THE

LAST DECADE. MOREOVER, WE COULD EXPERIENCE MORE THAN ONE SEVERE CATASTROPHIC EVENT IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.

ALL

OF THE CATASTROPHE MODELING TOOLS THAT WE USE, OR THAT WE RELY ON FROM OUTSIDE PARTIES, TO EVALUATE CERTAIN OF OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT

ARE SUBJECT TO ERROR AND MIS-ESTIMATION AND MAY PRODUCE ESTIMATES THAT ARE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN ACTUAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, COMPARED TO MODELS FOR HURRICANES, MODELS FOR EARTHQUAKES ARE LESS

RELIABLE DUE TO THERE BEING A MORE LIMITED NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL EVENTS TO ANALYZE, WHILE MODELS FOR TORNADOES AND HAIL STORMS ARE NEWER AND MAY BE EVEN LESS RELIABLE DUE TO THE HIGHLY

RANDOM GEOGRAPHIC NATURE AND SIZE OF THESE EVENTS. AS A RESULT, MODELS FOR EARTHQUAKES AND TORNADO AND HAIL STORMS MAY HAVE EVEN

GREATER DIFFICULTY PREDICTING RISKS AND ESTIMATING LOSSES. FURTHER, CHANGES IN CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD CAUSE OUR UNDERLYING MODELING DATA TO BE LESS PREDICTIVE, THUS LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO

EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE AND MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK. AS COMPARED TO NATURAL CATASTROPHES, MODELING FOR MAN-MADE CATASTROPHES, SUCH AS TERRORISM, IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AND LESS RELIABLE, AND FOR SOME

EVENTS, CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO RELIABLE MODELING TECHNIQUES. SEE "WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS PROVIDE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS" BELOW AS

WELL AS "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING" AND "CHANGING CLIMATE

CONDITIONS."

THE

EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT, THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT AND THE COVERAGE PROVIDED,

WHICH CAN BE BOTH PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COVERAGES. INCREASES IN THE VALUE AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF INSURED PROPERTY, THE NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS EXPOSED TO CERTAIN EVENTS AND THE EFFECTS OF

INFLATION COULD INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF CLAIMS FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION IMPACTED BY TORNADOES IS INHERENTLY RANDOM AND UNPREDICTABLE AND

THE SPECIFIC LOCATION IMPACTED BY A TORNADO MAY OR MAY NOT BE HIGHLY POPULATED AND MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF OUR INSURED EXPOSURES.

STATES

HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME PASSED LEGISLATION, AND REGULATORS HAVE TAKEN ACTION, THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK, SUCH AS

LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS FROM REDUCING EXPOSURES OR WITHDRAWING FROM CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS OR MANDATING THAT INSURERS PARTICIPATE IN RESIDUAL MARKETS. PARTICIPATION IN RESIDUAL MARKET

MECHANISMS HAS RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS TO INSURERS, INCLUDING US, AND, IN CERTAIN STATES, THOSE LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH

OUR DIRECT CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE IN THOSE STATES. IF OUR COMPETITORS LEAVE THOSE STATES HAVING RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS, REMAINING INSURERS, INCLUDING US, MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN

LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE. IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE INITIATIVES AND COURT DECISIONS THAT SEEK TO EXPAND INSURANCE

COVERAGE FOR CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE POLICIES OR SEEK TO PREVENT THE APPLICATION OF DEDUCTIBLES. ALSO, OUR ABILITY TO ADJUST TERMS, INCLUDING DEDUCTIBLE LEVELS, OR TO

INCREASE PRICING TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO OFFSET RISING COSTS OF CATASTROPHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, REQUIRES APPROVAL OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN STATES. OUR

ABILITY OR OUR WILLINGNESS TO MANAGE OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE BY RAISING PRICES, MODIFYING UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCING EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DUE

TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND/OR CHANGES IN THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE. WE ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IN CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS THAT WE MIGHT

NOT OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING OUR ACCESS TO OTHER UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES.

THERE

ARE ALSO FACTORS THAT IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES

CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND;

EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE; BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION COSTS; LATE REPORTED CLAIMS; LITIGATION; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTABILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS AS ACTUAL

CLAIMS EMERGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

EXPOSURE

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES RESULTING FROM A CATASTROPHE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS AND COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE

CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE, RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS. A RATINGS DOWNGRADE COULD HURT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD CAUSE

US TO EXHAUST OUR AVAILABLE REINSURANCE LIMITS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE. SUCH EVENTS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE CREDIT OF OUR REINSURERS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE, SEE "ITEM 1BUSINESSREINSURANCECATASTROPHE REINSURANCE." CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE CREDIT OF

THE ISSUERS OF SECURITIES, SUCH AS STATES OR MUNICIPALITIES, IN WHICH WE HAVE INVESTED.

IN

ADDITION, COVERAGE IN OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR TERRORISM IS LIMITED. ALTHOUGH THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM PROVIDES BENEFITS IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM,

THOSE BENEFITS ARE SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS AND THE PROGRAM IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 31, 2020. UNDER CURRENT PROVISIONS OF THIS PROGRAM, ONCE OUR LOSSES EXCEED

20% OF OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PREMIUM FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE US FOR 83% OF OUR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM

WHICH EXCEED THIS DEDUCTIBLE UP TO A TOTAL INDUSTRY PROGRAM CAP OF $100 BILLION. OUR ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS $2.45 BILLION FOR 2017. OVER THE REMAINING FOUR-YEAR LIFE

OF THE REAUTHORIZED PROGRAM, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT PERCENTAGE WILL FALL FROM 83% TO 80%. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS LAW IS UNTESTED, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL

UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW IT WILL BE APPLIED TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR EXAMPLE, APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO A SPECIFIC EVENT WILL DEPEND UPON WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT HAS DESIGNATED SUCH EVENT AS A

COVERED EVENT. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE LEGISLATION COULD CHANGE OR ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY INCREASING OUR EXPOSURE TO TERRORISM LOSSES, OR BY

LOWERING OUR BUSINESS VOLUME THROUGH EFFORTS TO AVOID THAT EXPOSURE. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM, SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL OR MAN-MADE EVENTS, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK OR OTHER INTENTIONALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTS,

INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS OR CYBER-ATTACKS, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY.

FURTHER, WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING FROM A HIGH FREQUENCY OF HIGH SEVERITY NATURAL CATASTROPHES AND/OR OF MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL

MEANS. IN ADDITION, WHILE

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE

SEEK TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL MEANS, WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ONE OR MORE MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC

EVENTS INVOLVING "UNCONVENTIONAL" MEANS, SUCH AS NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS.

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED OUR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE NECESSARY, INCLUDING

AS

A RESULT OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE

ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS: CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES; ADVERSE CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS, INCLUDING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES AND TECHNOLOGY CHANGES WHICH MAY IMPACT MEDICAL,

AUTO AND HOME REPAIR COSTS; ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING GENERAL AND WAGE INFLATION; LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES; AND VARYING JUDGMENTS AND VIEWPOINTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE

ESTIMATION PROCESS, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE

ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF

OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER).

IT

IS POSSIBLE THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PAST OR FUTURE STEPS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STIMULATE THE U.S. ECONOMY, INCLUDING TAX REFORM AND CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

REGULATION, SUCH AS THE POTENTIAL FOR A DESTINATION-BASED, BORDER-ADJUSTABLE CONSUMPTION TAX SYSTEM AND/OR TARIFFS, COULD LEAD TO HIGHER INFLATION THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, WHICH COULD IN TURN LEAD TO

AN INCREASE IN OUR LOSS COSTS. THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON LOSS COSTS COULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED FOR THOSE LINES OF BUSINESS THAT ARE CONSIDERED "LONG TAIL," SUCH AS GENERAL LIABILITY, AS THEY REQUIRE A

RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. IN ADDITION, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF CLAIMS COSTS, INCLUDING THOSE IN "LONG TAIL" LINES OF BUSINESS, CONSISTS

OF MEDICAL COSTS. CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE AVAILABILITY, COST AND ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS FOR MEDICAL SERVICES, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, AS A RESULT,

INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN MEDICAL COSTS MAY INCREASE OR CLAIM FREQUENCY AND/OR SEVERITY MAY OTHERWISE BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. THE ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES MAY ALSO BE

MORE DIFFICULT DURING TIMES OF ADVERSE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS DUE TO UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR OF CLAIMANTS AND POLICYHOLDERS, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT REPORTING OF EXPOSURES AND/OR LOSSES, REDUCED MAINTENANCE OF INSURED PROPERTIES,

INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SMALL CLAIMS OR DELAYS IN THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES MAY BE INFLUENCED BY OTHER EXTERNAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING CONTINUED INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY PLAINTIFF ATTORNEYS.

WE

CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR, ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS, ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND

SETTLED, AND THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT EVOLVES. BUSINESS JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO

MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. DIFFERENT EXPERTS MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND AREAS

OF FOCUS. HENCE, SUCH EXPERTS MAY AT TIMES PRODUCE ESTIMATES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. THIS RISK MAY BE EXACERBATED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACQUISITION. EXPERTS PROVIDING INPUT TO THE VARIOUS

ESTIMATES AND UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE ACTUARIES, UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS OTHER

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MEMBERS

OF MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

WE

ATTEMPT TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED OR REVIEWED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY

UNDERLYING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ESTIMATES, THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WILL LIKELY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE

RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN IS CURRENTLY RESERVED.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM ONE INSURED EVENT, OR AN ACCUMULATION OF INSURED EVENTS, MAY EXCEED THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN

ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD,

CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

FOR

A DISCUSSION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES BY PRODUCT LINE, INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF COMMON FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT REQUIRED RESERVES, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES."

DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR DETERIORATION AND LIKELY WILL

EXPERIENCE PERIODS OF DISRUPTION OR DETERIORATION IN THE FUTURE. IF FINANCIAL MARKETS EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY LIKELY WOULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. FOR EXAMPLE, FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS HAVE RESULTED IN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCED BUSINESS VOLUME, AS WELL AS

HEIGHTENED CREDIT RISK AND REDUCED VALUATIONS FOR CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENTS. AN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT, AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY AFTER A DISRUPTION OR OTHERWISE,

MAY ALSO, AS WE DISCUSS IN RISK FACTORS ABOVE, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LOSS COSTS AND THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

FINANCIAL

MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COULD BE EXACERBATED BY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY IN MANY REGIONS OF THE WORLD. THIS CAN IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS EVEN IF WE DO NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THE REGION SUBJECT TO THE INSTABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, DUE TO GLOBALIZATION, INSTABILITY IN ONE REGION CAN SPREAD TO OTHER REGIONS WHERE WE DO BUSINESS. IN

EUROPE, UNCERTAINTY IN RECENT YEARS HAS INCLUDED THE INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT ISSUERS, THE POTENTIAL PARTIAL OR COMPLETE DISSOLUTION OF THE EUROZONE AND

ITS COMMON CURRENCY AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SUCH POTENTIAL EVENTS ON GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY. ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING THE UNITED

KINGDOM'S EXPECTED WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, MAY IMPACT THESE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED RISKS. IN THE UNITED STATES, FUTURE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT MAY ALSO IMPACT

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NEW U.S. ADMINISTRATION MAY ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE U.S. FEDERAL BUDGET AND TAXES, THE NATIONAL DEBT, INTERNATIONAL TRADE, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND

REGULATION GENERALLY DIFFERENTLY THAN THE PRIOR U.S. ADMINISTRATION, ALL OF WHICH MAY CONTRIBUTE, POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY, TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY AND CREATE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY.

SEVERAL

OF THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND BELOW IDENTIFY RISKS THAT COULD RESULT FROM, OR BE EXACERBATED BY, FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION, AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN OR ECONOMIC

UNCERTAINTY. THESE INCLUDE RISKS DISCUSSED ABOVE RELATED TO OUR ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, AND THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES, REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS, OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND

THE IMPACT OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS," PARTICULARLY THE

"OUTLOOK" SECTION, FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE RISKS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR MATERIAL REALIZED OR UNREALIZED

LOSSES.

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY. FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 93% OF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES CAUSED BY INFLATION OR OTHER FACTORS (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS) AFFECT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS ON OUR FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND NEW FIXED MATURITY

INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING THOSE PURCHASED TO RE-INVEST MATURITIES FROM THE EXISTING PORTFOLIO), THEREBY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME, WHILE RISING INTEREST RATES REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE

OF EXISTING FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, THEREBY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR BOOK VALUE. DURING 2016, THE NET PRE-TAX UNREALIZED GAIN IN OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO DECREASED FROM $1.78 BILLION TO

$865 MILLION AS INTEREST RATES INCREASED. ANY FUTURE INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS) WOULD RESULT IN A FURTHER DECLINE IN THAT UNREALIZED GAIN POSITION OR IN AN

UNREALIZED LOSS, THEREBY ADVERSELY IMPACTING OUR BOOK VALUE. INTEREST RATES IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN AT VERY LOW LEVELS RELATIVE TO HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT RATES MAY

REMAIN AT LOW LEVELS FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD. THE VALUE OF OUR FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MAY DEFAULT OR BECOME IMPAIRED DUE TO A

DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR PORTFOLIO, OR DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN INSURER THAT GUARANTEES AN ISSUER'S

PAYMENTS OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. SUCH DEFAULTS AND IMPAIRMENTS COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS COULD BE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT. RAPID CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OIL PRICES, COULD ALSO SUBJECT CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENTS TO A HIGHER RISK

OF DEFAULT.

OUR

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED, IN SUBSTANTIAL PART, IN OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL

BOND PORTFOLIO). NOTWITHSTANDING THE RELATIVELY LOW HISTORICAL RATES OF DEFAULT ON MANY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT WE TYPICALLY SEEK TO INVEST IN HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY SECURITIES

(INCLUDING THOSE WITH STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS SUCH AS BEING SECURED BY DEDICATED OR PLEDGED SOURCES OF REVENUE), OUR MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO COULD BE SUBJECT TO DEFAULT OR IMPAIRMENT. IN

PARTICULAR.



IN RECENT YEARS, MANY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER DEFICITS OR PROJECTED DEFICITS. THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THESE

DEFICITS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION OF OUR MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO. THESE DEFICITS MAY BE EXACERBATED BY THE IMPACT OF UNFUNDED PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS OR BY DECLINING MUNICIPAL TAX BASES AND REVENUES IN TIMES OF FINANCIAL STRESS.



SOME ISSUERS MAY BE UNWILLING TO INCREASE TAX RATES, OR TO REDUCE SPENDING, TO FUND INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THEIR MUNICIPAL BONDS, OR

MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET TO FUND SUCH PAYMENTS. THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD DEFAULTS MAY INCREASE IF SOME ISSUERS VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO DEFAULT, INSTEAD OF IMPLEMENTING DIFFICULT

FISCAL MEASURES, AND THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CONSEQUENCES (SUCH AS REDUCED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS) ARE LESS SEVERE THAN EXPECTED.



THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD DEFAULTS MAY ALSO INCREASE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN LEGISLATION THAT PERMIT STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL

SUBDIVISIONS TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION WHERE THEY WERE NOT PERMITTED BEFORE. IN ADDITION, THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION OF MUNICIPAL BONDS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THERE ARE JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS IN A BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER PROCEEDING THAT LESSEN THE VALUE OF STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, DEBTORS MAY CHALLENGE THE EFFECTIVENESS

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF

STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS THOUGHT TO BE PROVIDED BY MUNICIPAL SECURITIES BACKED BY A DEDICATED SOURCE OF REVENUE. THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION MAY ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THERE ARE JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS IN A BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER PROCEEDING THAT QUESTION THE PAYMENT PRIORITY OF MUNICIPAL BONDS.

APPROXIMATELY

30% OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO IS EXPECTED TO MATURE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS (THIS INCLUDES THE EARLY REDEMPTION OF BONDS, ASSUMING INTEREST RATES (INCLUDING CREDIT

SPREADS) DO NOT RISE SIGNIFICANTLY BY APPLICABLE CALL DATES). FOR A SCHEDULE OF THE CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF OUR FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO BY YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO." OF THAT MATURING PORTFOLIO, A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT

INCLUDES MUNICIPAL BONDS THAT HAVE BEEN PRE-REFUNDED WITH U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. AS A RESULT, EVEN IF OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, THE OVERALL

YIELD ON AND COMPOSITION OF OUR PORTFOLIO COULD BE MEANINGFULLY IMPACTED BY THE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR REINVESTMENT WITH THE PROCEEDS OF MATURED BONDS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YIELDS REMAIN LOW

WHEN WE REINVEST SUCH PROCEEDS, OUR FUTURE NET INVESTMENT INCOME WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC BONDS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE AT THE TIME OF RE-INVESTMENT, THE MIX

OF SPECIFIC ISSUERS IN OUR FIXED-INCOME AND MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO WILL CHANGE.

OUR

PORTFOLIO HAS BENEFITED FROM TAX EXEMPTIONS (SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO INTEREST FROM MUNICIPAL BONDS) AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE GOVERNING

DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH AS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). CHANGES IN THESE LAWS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. SEE "CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS OR IN THE

TAX LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US" BELOW.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES: RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS; PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY

SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES; COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; AND WHOLLY-OWNED REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUATIONS

AND/OR FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION.

WE

ALSO INVEST A PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN OTHER

TYPES OF NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS WITH EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE RISK, SUCH AS OIL. ALL OF THESE ASSET CLASSES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY IN THEIR INVESTMENT

RETURNS THAN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR NON-FIXED MATURITY

INVESTMENTS AND THE REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME, AND/OR RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY REALIZE REDUCED RETURNS ON THESE INVESTMENTS, INCUR LOSSES

ON SALES OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. FROM TIME TO TIME,

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS TO MANAGE THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, WHICH CAN RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASED VALUATION UNCERTAINTIES WHEN INVESTMENT MARKETS ARE ILLIQUID. THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE

ILLIQUID, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (I.E., THE CARRYING AMOUNT) OF THE PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AS REFLECTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF PRICES AT WHICH ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS COULD OCCUR.

GIVEN

THAT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN AND COULD BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, WE MAY, DEPENDING ON CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE FUTURE, MAKE CHANGES TO THE MIX OF INVESTMENTS IN OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THESE CHANGES MAY IMPACT THE DURATION, VOLATILITY AND RISK OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE REALIZED AND/OR

UNREALIZED

INVESTMENT LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY.

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BECAUSE OF OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

WITH REGARD

TO ASBESTOS

CLAIMS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS (INCLUDING OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY). FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS

INCLUDE CONTINUED INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS AND THE CONTINUED FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION. THE

FOCUS ON THESE DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. THE BANKRUPTCY OF MANY TRADITIONAL

DEFENDANTS HAS ALSO CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY

SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION

ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET. THIS TREND OF PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT

TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION, HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS WE EXPERIENCED.

WE

ALSO CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A

PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED

AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDER'S FAVOR

AND OUR OTHER DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF

ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN A MODERATION IN THE OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF

THESE CLAIMS.

FURTHER,

IN ADDITION TO CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO

THE HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS,

INCLUDING US, COULD BE MADE IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON

NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY.

WITH

REGARD TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR ALLEGED

DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARISE UNDER VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND

THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE

PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS MAY BE IMPOSED ON CERTAIN PARTIES EVEN IF THEY DID NOT CAUSE THE RELEASE OR

THREATENED RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SOME

COURT

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECISIONS

HAVE INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO

JURISDICTION.

UNCERTAINTIES

SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS AND RELATED

LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT

LIMITATION.



THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION;



A FURTHER INCREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE, AND/OR THE NUMBER OF, ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED;



THE EMERGENCE OF A GREATER NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS THAN ANTICIPATED AS A RESULT OF EXTENDED LIFE EXPECTANCIES RESULTING FROM MEDICAL ADVANCES

AND LIFESTYLE IMPROVEMENTS;



THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES WE HAVE ISSUED;



THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES CONCERNING COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS

ASSESSMENT OF THESE DISPUTES;



THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST US;



FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS;



ANY IMPACT ON ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WE INSURE DUE TO THE BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS;



THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH

THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS; AND



UNCERTAINTIES ARISING FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS.

IT

IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS

ENVIRONMENT COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION AND FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR

JUDICIAL REFORMS

ESTABLISHING MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A

LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE.

WHILE

THE ONGOING EVALUATION OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN

LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND

"ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS." ALSO SEE

"ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS."

THE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE, AND THE IMPACT OF INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE

OPERATE,

COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY.

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND

WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL REMAIN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INSURERS WHICH MAY

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OFFER

PRODUCTS AT PRICES AND ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ECONOMIC STANDARDS IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE THEIR BUSINESS. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD

ALSO BE IMPACTED BY CURRENT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS AVAILABLE TO US AS WELL AS TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN RECENT YEARS, PENSION AND HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHER

ENTITIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL AVAILABLE CAPITAL AND POTENTIALLY LOWER RETURN OBJECTIVES HAVE INCREASINGLY SOUGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES.

WELL-CAPITALIZED NEW ENTRANTS TO THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRIES, EXISTING COMPETITORS THAT RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL INFUSIONS OF CAPITAL, AS WELL AS COMPETITORS THAT CAN

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MORE FAVORABLE TAX DOMICILES THAN THE UNITED STATES, MAY CONDUCT BUSINESS IN WAYS THAT ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND PROFITABILITY. FURTHER, AN EXPANDED SUPPLY OF

REINSURANCE CAPITAL MAY LOWER COSTS FOR INSURERS THAT RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON REINSURANCE AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, THOSE INSURERS MAY BE ABLE TO PRICE THEIR PRODUCTS MORE COMPETITIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, INCLUDING CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, NOT ONLY IN PERSONAL LINES (WHERE WE CURRENTLY AND MAY

INCREASINGLY COMPETE AGAINST DIRECT WRITERS), BUT ALSO IN COMMERCIAL LINES (WHERE DIRECT WRITERS MAY BECOME A MORE SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF COMPETITION IN THE FUTURE, PARTICULARLY IN THE SMALL COMMERCIAL

MARKET). CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY ALSO COULD ALTER THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND/OR THE RATES OR TERMS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IN

PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE USE OF COMPARATIVE RATING TECHNOLOGIES HAS IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT, OUR BUSINESS AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE

COMPANY'S PERSONAL INSURANCE NEW BUSINESS IS WRITTEN AFTER AN AGENT COMPARES QUOTES USING COMPARATIVE RATING TECHNOLOGIES, A COST-EFFICIENT MEANS OF OBTAINING QUOTES FROM MULTIPLE COMPANIES. BECAUSE

THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, WHETHER BY AGENTS OR DIRECTLY BY CUSTOMERS, FACILITATES THE PROCESS OF GENERATING MULTIPLE QUOTES, THE TECHNOLOGY HAS INCREASED PRICE COMPARISON ON NEW BUSINESS AND,

INCREASINGLY, ON RENEWAL BUSINESS. IT ALSO HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF QUOTE ACTIVITY AND A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF QUOTES THAT RESULT IN NEW BUSINESS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND THESE TRENDS MAY

CONTINUE OR ACCELERATE. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OPERATE WITH A COMPETITIVE COST STRUCTURE OR ACCURATELY ESTIMATE AND PRICE FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, OUR BUSINESS VOLUME AND UNDERWRITING

MARGINS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OVER TIME. ADDITIONALLY, SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY IS STARTING TO BE USED TO ACCESS COMPARATIVE RATES FOR SMALL COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND THAT TREND MAY CONTINUE OR

ACCELERATE.

TECHNOLOGY

COMPANIES OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES HAVE CREATED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE CREATE, DIGITALLY-ENABLED ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. THESE ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS MAY COMPETE WITH US DIRECTLY BY PROVIDING, OR ARRANGING TO PROVIDE, INSURANCE COVERAGE THEMSELVES. SEE ALSO

"DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US" BELOW.

OTHER

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY PRESENT COMPETITIVE RISKS. FOR EXAMPLE, INNOVATIONS, SUCH AS TELEMATICS AND OTHER USAGE-BASED METHODS OF DETERMINING PREMIUMS, CAN IMPACT PRODUCT DESIGN

AND PRICING AND MAY BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTOR. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION COULD BE IMPACTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEPLOY, IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER, TECHNOLOGY THAT

COLLECTS AND ANALYZES A WIDE VARIETY OF DATA POINTS (SO-CALLED "BIG DATA" ANALYSIS) TO MAKE UNDERWRITING OR OTHER DECISIONS, OR IF OUR COMPETITORS COLLECT AND USE DATA WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY

TO ACCESS OR USE. SEE ALSO "OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY"

BELOW.

COMPETITIVE

DYNAMICS MAY IMPACT THE SUCCESS OF EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERWRITING MARGINS ON OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THESE EFFORTS COULD INCLUDE SEEKING IMPROVED RATES, AS WELL AS

IMPROVED TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND COULD ALSO INCLUDE OTHER INITIATIVES, SUCH AS REDUCING OPERATING EXPENSES AND ACQUISITION COSTS. THESE EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND/OR MAY RESULT IN LOWER

RETENTION AND NEW BUSINESS LEVELS AND THEREFORE LOWER BUSINESS VOLUMES. IN ADDITION, IF OUR UNDERWRITING IS NOT EFFECTIVE, FURTHER EFFORTS TO INCREASE RATES COULD ALSO LEAD TO "ADVERSE SELECTION",

WHEREBY ACCOUNTS RETAINED HAVE HIGHER LOSSES, AND ARE LESS PROFITABLE, THAN ACCOUNTS LOST. FOR MORE DETAIL, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOUTLOOK."

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SIMILAR TO OTHER INDUSTRIES, THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS UNDERGOING RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL AND OTHER CHANGE. TRADITIONAL INSURANCE INDUSTRY

PARTICIPANTS, TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, "INSURTECH" START-UP COMPANIES, THE NUMBER OF WHICH HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS, AND OTHERS ARE FOCUSED ON USING TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION TO

SIMPLIFY AND IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, INCREASE EFFICIENCIES, REDESIGN PRODUCTS, ALTER BUSINESS MODELS AND EFFECT OTHER POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE CHANGES IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. IF WE DO NOT

ANTICIPATE, KEEP PACE WITH AND ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL AND OTHER CHANGES IMPACTING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, IT COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE, DECREASE THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS, AND

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ALSO POSE RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS. FOR

EXAMPLE, TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS DRIVERLESS VEHICLES, ASSISTED-DRIVING TECHNOLOGIES, TECHNOLOGIES THAT FACILITATE RIDE OR HOME SHARING, SMART HOMES OR AUTOMATION COULD REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF

OUR PRODUCTS, CREATE COVERAGE ISSUES OR IMPACT THE FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY OF LOSSES, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY.

OVERALL,

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IN OUR VARIOUS BUSINESSES IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO OUR.



ABILITY TO PROFITABLY PRICE OUR BUSINESS, RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND OBTAIN NEW BUSINESS;



PREMIUMS CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED (INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED PROGRAMS);



AGENT, BROKER AND POLICYHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS;



ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS;



SPEED OF CLAIMS PAYMENT;



ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER;



ABILITY TO ADAPT TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS MODELS, TECHNOLOGY, CUSTOMER PREFERENCES OR REGULATION IMPACTING THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE;



PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CORRESPONDING RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES;



REPUTATION, EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES;



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS; AND



LOCAL PRESENCE.

WE

MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN CONTINUING TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON ANY OF THESE BASES IN THE FUTURE. IF COMPETITION OR TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER CHANGES TO THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE

LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING BUSINESS OR WRITE NEW BUSINESS AT ADEQUATE RATES OR ON APPROPRIATE TERMS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE "COMPETITION"

SECTIONS OF THE DISCUSSION ON BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN "ITEM 1BUSINESS."

DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US

.    WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS

PRIMARILY

THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN THROUGH LESS THAN A DOZEN SUCH INTERMEDIARIES. FURTHER, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND OF INCREASED CONSOLIDATION BY AGENTS

AND BROKERS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH, AND FEES PAID TO, SOME AGENTS AND BROKERS, AND/OR OTHERWISE NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PRICING OR DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. AGENTS AND BROKERS

MAY INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH US TO THE EXTENT THAT MARKETS INCREASINGLY PROVIDE THEM WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO PROVIDERS OF CAPITAL SEEKING EXPOSURE TO INSURANCE RISK. SEE ALSO "THE INTENSE COMPETITION

THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY." IN ALL OF THE FOREGOING SITUATIONS, LOSS

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF

ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDED THROUGH SUCH AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE

MAY ALSO SEEK TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, WHICH COULD DISRUPT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR AGENTS AND BROKERS. IN ADDITION, AGENTS AND BROKERS MAY CREATE ALTERNATE

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND PRICING. ACCESS TO GREATER LEVELS OF DATA AND INCREASED UTILIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY BY AGENTS AND

BROKERS MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, BROKERS INCREASINGLY HAVE BEEN PACKAGING PORTFOLIOS OF RISKS TOGETHER AND OFFERING THEM TO A

NARROWER RANGE OF CARRIERS AS WELL AS, IN SOME CASES, REQUESTING A COMMITMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PORTFOLIOS IN ADVANCE. OUR EFFORTS OR THEIR EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO NEW PRODUCTS OR ALTERNATE

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE WAY AGENTS AND BROKERS UTILIZE DATA AND TECHNOLOGY, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS WHO CURRENTLY

MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, RESULTING IN A LOWER VOLUME AND/OR PROFITABILITY OF BUSINESS GENERATED FROM THESE SOURCES.

WE

RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKETING AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY INCREASINGLY RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS AND TOLL-FREE NUMBERS FOR DISTRIBUTION. IN

SOME INSTANCES, OUR AGENTS AND BROKERS ARE REQUIRED TO ACCESS SEPARATE BUSINESS PLATFORMS TO EXECUTE THE SALE OF OUR PERSONAL INSURANCE OR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. SHOULD INTERNET DISRUPTIONS

OCCUR, OR FRUSTRATION WITH OUR BUSINESS PLATFORMS OR DISTRIBUTION INITIATIVES DEVELOP AMONG OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, ANY RESULTING LOSS OF BUSINESS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE "IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA SECURITY AND/OR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED" BELOW.

CUSTOMERS

IN THE PAST HAVE BROUGHT CLAIMS AGAINST US FOR THE ACTIONS OF OUR AGENTS. EVEN WITH PROPER CONTROLS IN PLACE, ACTUAL OR ALLEGED ERRORS OR INACCURACIES BY OUR AGENTS COULD

RESULT IN OUR INVOLVEMENT IN DISPUTES, LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTIONS RELATED TO ACTIONS TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN BY OUR AGENTS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO, AND MAY FACE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING, MASS TORT CLAIMS SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR

SUBSTANCES.

IN ADDITION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO OTHER TYPES OF MASS TORT CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES, SUCH AS LEAD PAINT, SILICA AND WELDING ROD FUMES. ESTABLISHING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MASS TORT CLAIMS IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTIES

BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, DISPUTES CONCERNING MEDICAL CAUSATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DISEASES, GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION OF THE LAWSUITS ASSERTING THE

CLAIMS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE RISE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS WITHOUT UNDERLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN DISEASE RATES. MOREOVER, EVOLVING JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS TORT THEORIES AND DEFENSES, INCLUDING APPLICATION OF VARIOUS THEORIES OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF INSURANCE

COVERAGE TO THESE CLAIMS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE, AND SUCH CHANGE COULD BE MATERIAL. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

AS INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL, JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND

OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIM AND COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING BY EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OUR

UNDERWRITING INTENT, BY INCREASING THE NUMBER,

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SIZE

OR TYPES OF CLAIMS OR BY MANDATING CHANGES TO OUR UNDERWRITING PRACTICES. EXAMPLES OF EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED

TO.



JUDICIAL EXPANSION OF POLICY COVERAGE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW OR EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY;



PLAINTIFFS TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATING TO CLAIMS-HANDLING AND OTHER

PRACTICES;



CLAIMS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS, WHICH OFTEN PRESENT COMPLEX COVERAGE AND DAMAGE VALUATION QUESTIONS;



CLAIMS UNDER DIRECTORS' & OFFICERS' INSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO LOSSES FROM INVOLVEMENT IN FINANCIAL MARKET ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS

MORTGAGE OR FINANCIAL PRODUCT ORIGINATION, DISTRIBUTION, STRUCTURING OR SERVICING AND FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES; FAILED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; FRAUD; IMPROPER SALES PRACTICES; POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING

IRREGULARITIES; AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ISSUES;



CLAIMS RELATED TO DATA AND NETWORK SECURITY BREACHES, INFORMATION SYSTEM FAILURES OR CYBER-ATTACKS, INCLUDING CASES WHERE COVERAGE WAS NOT

INTENDED TO BE PROVIDED;



THE ASSERTION OF "PUBLIC NUISANCE" OR SIMILAR THEORIES OF LIABILITY, PURSUANT TO WHICH PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO RECOVER MONIES SPENT TO ADMINISTER

PUBLIC HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, ABATE HAZARDS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND/OR RECOVER DAMAGES PURPORTEDLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A "PUBLIC NUISANCE";



CLAIMS RELATED TO LIABILITY OR WORKERS' COMPENSATION ARISING OUT OF THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR PANDEMIC;



CLAIMS RELATING TO ABUSE BY AN EMPLOYEE OR A VOLUNTEER OF AN INSURED;



CLAIMS THAT LINK HEALTH ISSUES TO PARTICULAR CAUSES (FOR EXAMPLE, CUMULATIVE TRAUMATIC HEAD INJURY FROM SPORTS OR OTHER CAUSES), RESULTING IN

LIABILITY OR WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS;



CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT ONE OR MORE OF OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT ON PERSONS BELONGING TO A PROTECTED CLASS IN VIOLATION OF

THE LAW, INCLUDING THE FAIR HOUSING ACT;



CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF MODERN TECHNIQUES AND PRACTICES USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXTRACTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES, SUCH AS HYDRAULIC FRACTURING

OR WASTEWATER INJECTION;



CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF PERSONAL CARS, HOMES OR OTHER PROPERTY IN COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS RIDE OR HOME SHARING;



CLAIMS RELATING TO UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES OF CURRENT OR NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS MODELS OR PROCESSES, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF RELATED

BEHAVIORAL CHANGES; AND



CLAIMS RELATING TO POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, INCLUDING HIGHER FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS.

IN

SOME INSTANCES, THESE EMERGING ISSUES MAY NOT BECOME APPARENT FOR SOME TIME AFTER WE HAVE ISSUED THE AFFECTED INSURANCE POLICIES. AS A RESULT, THE FULL EXTENT OF LIABILITY UNDER OUR

INSURANCE POLICIES MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THE POLICIES ARE ISSUED.

IN

ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL PASSAGE OF NEW LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO EXPAND THE RIGHT TO SUE, TO REMOVE LIMITATIONS ON RECOVERY, TO DEEM BY STATUTE THE EXISTENCE OF A COVERED OCCURRENCE, TO

EXTEND THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OR OTHERWISE TO REPEAL OR WEAKEN TORT REFORMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

THE

EFFECTS OF THESE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL AND WE

ARE

EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO OUR STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS.

ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO US TO THE EXTENT OF THE CEDED REINSURANCE, WE REMAIN LIABLE AS

THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. AS A RESULT, CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT ELIMINATE OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR

ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS.

IN

THE PAST, CERTAIN REINSURERS HAVE CEASED WRITING BUSINESS AND ENTERED INTO RUNOFF. SOME OF OUR REINSURANCE CLAIMS MAY BE DISPUTED BY THE REINSURERS, AND WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE

PARTIAL OR NO PAYMENT. THIS IS A PARTICULAR RISK IN THE CASE OF CLAIMS THAT RELATE TO INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN

ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS

CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS ARE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SETTLE

CERTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE WE DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT

IS INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED CLAIM COST IS INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, AS WE RETAIN THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT.

SOME OF THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM WHICH WE HAVE PURCHASED STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS SUBSEQUENT TO THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE. IF IT IS

EXPECTED THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PAY, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF THE RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE IF, AND TO THE EXTENT, THE PURCHASED ANNUITIES ARE NOT COVERED BY

STATE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR TOP

REINSURANCE GROUPS BY REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE AND THE TOP FIVE GROUPS BY AMOUNT OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS PROVIDED, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES."

THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRICE AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY. THE AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE CAPACITY CAN BE

IMPACTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONS IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET, SUCH AS THE OCCURRENCE OF SIGNIFICANT REINSURED EVENTS. THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE COULD AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, RECENTLY HAVE BEEN PRESSURING THE U.S. TO REDUCE ITS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR U.S. CEDING COMPANIES TO

OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM REINSURERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHICH, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR U.S. COMPANIES, INCLUDING US, TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL, IF ANY, IN

SUCH REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL, AND/OR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY FAIL TO MAKE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, AND THUS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN OF OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN GUARANTEE OR INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH THIRD

PARTIES.

IN ADDITION TO EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES (DISCUSSED ABOVE), WE ARE

EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN SEVERAL OTHER AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK RELATING TO POLICYHOLDERS, INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

WE

ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN OUR SURETY INSURANCE OPERATIONS, WHERE WE GUARANTEE TO A THIRD PARTY THAT OUR CUSTOMER WILL SATISFY CERTAIN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (E.G., A

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT) OR

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN

FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING EXPOSURE TO LARGE CUSTOMERS WHO MAY HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO MULTIPLE THIRD PARTIES. IF OUR CUSTOMER DEFAULTS, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES AND NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THAT

CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, IT IS CUSTOMARY PRACTICE IN THE SURETY BUSINESS FOR MULTIPLE INSURERS TO PARTICIPATE AS CO-SURETIES ON LARGE SURETY BONDS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE CO-SURETY OBLIGATIONS

ARE TYPICALLY JOINT AND SEVERAL, IN WHICH CASE WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR CO-SURETIES.

IN

ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER CASUALTY INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE

CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE SETTLED CLAIM. WE ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, AND, AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK TO THE POLICYHOLDER.

MOREOVER, CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND/OR GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES (I.E., POLICIES IN WHICH PREMIUMS ARE ADJUSTED AFTER THE POLICY PERIOD

BASED ON THE ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER DURING THE POLICY PERIOD). RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADJUSTED PREMIUM IS GREATER

THAN THE ORIGINAL PREMIUM.

OUR

EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK THAT WE HAVE TO OUR INSUREDS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. TO REDUCE SUCH CREDIT RISK, WE REQUIRE CERTAIN INSUREDS TO POST COLLATERAL FOR SOME OR ALL OF

THESE OBLIGATIONS, OFTEN IN THE FORM OF PLEDGED SECURITIES SUCH AS MONEY MARKET FUNDS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY BANKS, SURETY BONDS OR CASH. IN CASES WHERE WE RECEIVE PLEDGED SECURITIES AND THE

INSUREDS ARE UNABLE TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON THE SECURITIES PLEDGED AND/OR THE RISK THAT OUR ACCESS TO THAT COLLATERAL MAY BE STAYED DURING AN INSURED'S

BANKRUPTCY. IN CASES WHERE WE RECEIVE LETTERS OF CREDIT FROM BANKS AND THE INSUREDS ARE UNABLE TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE BANKS THAT ISSUED THE LETTERS OF

CREDIT.

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHEN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE INSURANCE POLICIES FROM US THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE PREMIUMS RELATING TO THOSE POLICIES ARE OFTEN

PAID TO THE AGENTS AND BROKERS FOR PAYMENT TO US. IN MOST JURISDICTIONS, THE PREMIUMS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PAID TO US WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY US. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ASSUME A

DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS DUE FROM INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

TO

A LARGE DEGREE, THE CREDIT RISK WE FACE IS A FUNCTION OF THE ECONOMY; ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE A GREATER RISK IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE RISKS DISCUSSED ABOVE

THROUGH UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS, OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE, COLLATERAL OBTAINED MAY SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE LITTLE OR NO VALUE.

FURTHER, THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL PROTECTION WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN ON THE BUSINESS WE WRITE IN CERTAIN MARKETS HAS DECREASED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DECREASE, AS A RESULT OF COMPETITION. WE ARE

ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CERTAIN GUARANTEE OR INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH THIRD PARTIES. SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS A

RESULT, OUR EXPOSURE TO THE ABOVE CREDIT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED BY THE STATES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING LICENSING AND SUPERVISION, AND CHANGES IN REGULATION MAY REDUCE

OUR

PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

THESE REGULATORY SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS, AND NOT NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF

INSURERS, THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INVESTORS. FOR EXAMPLE, TO PROTECT POLICYHOLDERS WHOSE INSURANCE COMPANY BECOMES FINANCIALLY INSOLVENT, GUARANTY FUNDS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ALL 50 STATES TO

PAY THE COVERED CLAIMS OF POLICYHOLDERS IN THE EVENT OF AN INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURER, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE STATE LIMITS. THE FUNDING OF GUARANTY FUNDS IS PROVIDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST

REMAINING INSURERS IN THE MARKETPLACE. AS A RESULT, THE INSOLVENCY OF ONE OR MORE INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST US. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL STATES RESTRICT THE

TIMING AND/OR THE ABILITY OF AN INSURER TO DISCONTINUE WRITING A LINE OF BUSINESS OR TO CANCEL OR NON-RENEW CERTAIN POLICIES.

THESE

REGULATORY SYSTEMS ALSO ADDRESS AUTHORIZATION FOR LINES OF BUSINESS, STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS, LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS,

UNDERWRITING

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIMITATIONS,

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS, CHANGES IN CONTROL, PREMIUM RATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF AN INSURER'S BUSINESS INCLUDING,

MOST RECENTLY, CYBER-SECURITY.

THE

STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN UNDER CONTINUING SCRUTINY, AND SOME STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR INCREASE STATE AUTHORITY TO

REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES. FURTHER, THE NAIC AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY RE-EXAMINE EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON

MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

AS

PART OF THESE CHANGES, INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS WERE AMENDED TO REQUIRE INSURERS WHO ARE PART OF A HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM TO FILE AN ENTERPRISE RISK REPORT TO PROVIDE THE

LEAD INSURANCE REGULATOR WITH A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM) FRAMEWORK INCLUDING THE MATERIAL RISKS WITHIN THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM THAT COULD POSE RISK TO THE

INSURANCE ENTITIES WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. INSURERS HAVING PREMIUM VOLUME ABOVE CERTAIN THRESHOLDS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PERFORM AT LEAST ANNUALLY A SELF-ASSESSMENT

OF THEIR CURRENT AND FUTURE RISKS, INCLUDING THEIR LIKELY FUTURE SOLVENCY POSITION (KNOWN AS AN OWN RISK AND SOLVENCY ASSESSMENT OR ORSA) AND FILE A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT WITH THE INSURER'S LEAD

INSURANCE REGULATOR. THE REQUIREMENT FOR AN INSURER TO CONDUCT AN ORSA IS INTENDED TO FOSTER AN EFFECTIVE LEVEL OF ERM AT ALL INSURERS WITHIN A HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM, AND TO PROVIDE A GROUP-WIDE

PERSPECTIVE ON RISK AND CAPITAL AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE LEGAL ENTITY VIEW. ORSA IS NOW INCLUDED IN THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS (IAIS) STANDARDS AND IS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF

IMPLEMENTATION IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, CANADA, AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, AS A RESULT OF ORSA AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT MAY BE USED BY INSURANCE REGULATORS, OUR STATES OF

DOMICILE OR OTHER REGULATORY BODIES MAY REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR ERM PROCESS (E.G., PRESCRIBE THE USE OF SPECIFIC MODELS OR THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS IN THE COMPANY'S MODELS) THAT

HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO WRITE CERTAIN RISKS, LIMIT OUR RISK APPETITE TO WRITE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS OR REDUCE OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FLEXIBILITY. SEE "ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT" FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S ERM.

THE

NAIC AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS, AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE, ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE IAIS TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL COMMON FRAMEWORK (COMFRAME)

FOR THE SUPERVISION OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS (IAIGS). IF ADOPTED, COMFRAME WOULD REQUIRE THE DESIGNATION OF A GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISOR (REGULATOR) FOR EACH IAIG AND WOULD IMPOSE A GROUP

CAPITAL REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD BE APPLIED TO AN IAIG IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT LEGAL ENTITY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS. IN RESPONSE TO COMFRAME, THE NAIC DEVELOPED A

MODEL LAW THAT ALLOWS STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS IN THE U.S. TO BE DESIGNATED AS GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISORS FOR U.S. BASED IAIGS. ADDITIONALLY, THE NAIC IS DEVELOPING A GROUP CAPITAL ANALYTICAL TOOL THAT

WOULD BE APPLIED TO U.S. BASED INSURANCE GROUPS IN ADDITION TO THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC) REQUIREMENT THAT IS APPLIED ON A LEGAL ENTITY BASIS. THESE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS COULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT

OF CAPITAL THAT THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO HAVE AND COULD RESULT IN THE COMPANY BEING SUBJECT TO INCREASED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

REGULATORS

MAY CHOOSE TO ADOPT MORE RESTRICTIVE INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDS TO THEIR

PARENT COMPANIES OR THEY COULD REJECT RATE INCREASES DUE TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS MAY ALSO INCREASE THE STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, STATE TAX LAWS THAT SPECIFICALLY IMPACT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES OR OTHER TAXES, COULD BE ENACTED OR CHANGED BY STATES TO RAISE REVENUES.

STATE

LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR HIGHER COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND THUS

COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A DOWNGRADE IN OUR CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INCREASE

OUR

BORROWING COSTS.

CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO AN INSURER'S COMPETITIVE POSITION. RATING AGENCIES PERIODICALLY REVIEW INSURERS'

RATINGS AND CHANGE THEIR RATINGS CRITERIA; THEREFORE, OUR CURRENT RATINGS MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES

BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE REDUCED, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE MANY CUSTOMERS MAY REQUIRE THAT WE MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATINGS TO ENTER INTO, MAINTAIN OR RENEW BUSINESS WITH US.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND WE MAY INCUR HIGHER BORROWING COSTS. IF SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RESULTING FROM ONE OR

MORE MAJOR CATASTROPHES, OR SIGNIFICANT RESERVE ADDITIONS OR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT LOSSES WERE TO CAUSE OUR CAPITAL POSITION TO DETERIORATE SIGNIFICANTLY, OR IF ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES

SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE (WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO AT A REASONABLE COST OR AT ALL, ESPECIALLY AT A TIME OF FINANCIAL

MARKET DISRUPTION) IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR LIMIT THE EXTENT OF A DOWNGRADE. A CONTINUED TREND OF MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHES OR A PROLONGED FINANCIAL MARKET

DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN MAY LEAD RATING AGENCIES TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. SEE ALSO "DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED." FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR RATINGS, SEE "ITEM 1BUSINESSRATINGS."

THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS, PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER

DIVIDENDS

OR MAKE FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES.

OUR HOLDING COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND

PRINCIPAL ON OUTSTANDING DEBT, TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN, TO PAY OTHER CORPORATE EXPENSES AND TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES. THE

ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THEIR STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS, EARNINGS AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE REGULATION AS AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. OUR U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. IN A TIME OF PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR OTHERWISE, INSURANCE REGULATORS MAY

CHOOSE TO FURTHER RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IS ALSO

RESTRICTED BY REGULATIONS THAT SET STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED.

THE

INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS COULD HARM

OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS, TO PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES.

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN TARGETED MARKETS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND MAY CREATE ENHANCED RISKS.

A NUMBER OF OUR

RECENT AND

PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES INVOLVE DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPANDING EXISTING PRODUCTS IN TARGETED MARKETS. THIS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING EFFORTS, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO PROTECT OR GROW MARKET

SHARE.



WE MAY DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT INSURE RISKS WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY INSURED, CONTAIN NEW COVERAGE OR COVERAGE TERMS OR CONTAIN DIFFERENT

COMMISSION TERMS.



WE MAY REFINE OUR UNDERWRITING PROCESSES.



WE MAY SEEK TO EXPAND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.



WE MAY FOCUS ON GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE HAVE HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE OR NO MARKET SHARE.

WE

MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPANDING IN TARGETED MARKETS AND, EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL, THESE EFFORTS MAY CREATE ENHANCED RISKS. AMONG OTHER

TO THE EXTENT WE ARE ABLE TO MARKET NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN NEW MARKETS, OUR RISK EXPOSURES MAY CHANGE, AND THE DATA AND MODELS WE USE TO

MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES MAY NOT BE AS SOPHISTICATED OR EFFECTIVE AS THOSE WE USE IN EXISTING MARKETS OR WITH EXISTING PRODUCTS. THIS, IN TURN, COULD LEAD TO LOSSES IN EXCESS OF OUR EXPECTATIONS.



MODELS UNDERLYING AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DECISIONS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.



EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE OR INCREASE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CONFLICT, SUCH AS DESCRIBED ABOVE

UNDER "DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US."



IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS TO A NEW PRODUCT, SOME POLICYHOLDERS' PRICING MAY INCREASE, WHILE THE PRICING FOR

OTHER POLICYHOLDERS MAY DECREASE, THE NET IMPACT OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT RETENTION AND PROFIT MARGINS.



TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, WE MAY NEED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES, WHICH MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT

RESULTS IN THE NEAR TERM.

IF

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN TARGETED MARKETS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS PROVIDE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS.

THE

PROFITABILITY OF OUR

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS WE USE IN PRICING OUR POLICIES. WE UTILIZE PROPRIETARY AND

THIRD PARTY MODELS TO HELP US PRICE BUSINESS IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO BE CONSISTENT, OVER TIME, WITH ACTUAL RESULTS AND RETURN OBJECTIVES. WE INCORPORATE THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE, EXTERNAL INDUSTRY DATA AND ECONOMIC INDICES INTO OUR MODELING PROCESSES, AND WE USE VARIOUS METHODS, INCLUDING PREDICTIVE MODELING, FORECASTING AND SOPHISTICATED SIMULATION MODELING

TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE LOSS TRENDS AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE ALSO USE THESE MODELING PROCESSES, ANALYSES AND METHODS IN MAKING UNDERWRITING, PRICING AND REINSURANCE

DECISIONS AS PART OF MANAGING OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES AND OTHER EXTREME ADVERSE EVENTS. THESE MODELING PROCESSES INCORPORATE NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND FORECASTS ABOUT THE FUTURE LEVEL AND

VARIABILITY OF: FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES, INFLATION, INTEREST RATES AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AMONG OTHERS, THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO MAKE AND MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.

WHETHER

WE USE A PROPRIETARY OR THIRD PARTY MODEL, FUTURE EXPERIENCE MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM PAST AND CURRENT EXPERIENCE INCORPORATED IN A MODEL'S FORECASTS OR SIMULATIONS. THIS

INCLUDES THE LIKELIHOOD OF EVENTS OCCURRING OR CONTINUING OR THE CORRELATION AMONG EVENTS. THIRD PARTY MODELS MAY PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN WHAT OUR PROPRIETARY MODELING

PROCESSES PROVIDE. AS A RESULT, THIRD PARTY MODEL ESTIMATES OF LOSSES CAN BE, AND OFTEN HAVE BEEN, MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FOR SIMILAR EVENTS IN COMPARISON TO OUR PROPRIETARY ESTIMATES. THE DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THIRD PARTY MODEL ESTIMATES AND OUR PROPRIETARY ESTIMATES ARE DRIVEN BY THE USE OF DIFFERENT DATA SETS AS WELL AS DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND FORECASTS REGARDING THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF

EVENTS AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE EVENTS.

IF

WE FAIL TO APPROPRIATELY PRICE THE RISKS WE INSURE, OR FAIL TO CHANGE OUR PRICING MODELS TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT OUR CURRENT EXPERIENCE, OR IF OUR CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS MORE FREQUENT

OR SEVERE THAN OUR UNDERLYING RISK ASSUMPTIONS, OUR PROFIT MARGINS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE FREQUENCY AND/OR SEVERITY OF EXTREME ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRING, OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE RISKS WE ARE EXPOSED TO, WE MAY OVERPRICE OUR PRODUCTS, AND NEW

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS

GROWTH AND RETENTION OF OUR EXISTING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. AS WE EXPAND INTO DIFFERENT MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES, WE WILL WRITE MORE POLICIES IN MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS

WHERE WE HAVE LESS DATA SPECIFIC TO THESE NEW MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES, AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ERROR IN OUR MODELS AND STRATEGY. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING."

OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY.

WE DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS FOR CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND PROCESSING CLAIMS, AS WELL AS FOR PROVIDING THE DATA AND ANALYTICS WE

UTILIZE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS, AND THUS OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON MAINTAINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ENHANCE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS

THAT SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN A COST AND RESOURCE EFFICIENT MANNER. SOME SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR EXPENSE

RATIOS AS WE INVEST IN THE PROJECTS AND MAY COST MORE THAN WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE. IN ADDITION, SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY NOT DELIVER THE BENEFITS OR PERFORM AS EXPECTED, OR MAY BE REPLACED OR

BECOME OBSOLETE MORE QUICKLY THAN EXPECTED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, ADDITIONAL COSTS OR ACCELERATED RECOGNITION OF EXPENSES. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGE AND

UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, OR IF THE COSTS OF DOING SO ARE HIGHER THAN WE EXPECT, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE SERVICES TO, AND CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH, NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN A COST

EFFECTIVE MANNER AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA AND NETWORK SECURITY (INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF CYBER ATTACKS), OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OR CLOUD-BASED TECHNOLOGY, OUR ABILITY

TO

CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

WHILE TECHNOLOGY CAN STREAMLINE MANY BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE COST OF OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY

INITIATIVES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISKS. OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR EMPLOYEES' ABILITY TO PERFORM, IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. A SHUT-DOWN OF,

OR INABILITY TO ACCESS, ONE OR MORE OF OUR FACILITIES (INCLUDING OUR PRIMARY DATA PROCESSING FACILITY); A POWER OUTAGE; OR A FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR

OTHER SYSTEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SUCH FUNCTIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS, PARTICULARLY IF SUCH AN INTERRUPTION LASTS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE EVENT OF A COMPUTER

VIRUS OR DISASTER SUCH AS A NATURAL CATASTROPHE, TERRORIST ATTACK OR INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT, OUR SYSTEMS COULD BE INACCESSIBLE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OUR INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS INCREASINGLY INTERFACE WITH AND DEPEND ON THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING CLOUD-BASED, WE COULD EXPERIENCE SERVICE DENIALS OR FAILURES OF CONTROLS IF DEMAND

FOR OUR SERVICE EXCEEDS CAPACITY OR A THIRD-PARTY SYSTEM FAILS OR EXPERIENCES AN INTERRUPTION. BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS AND FAILURES OF CONTROLS COULD ALSO RESULT IF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS DO NOT

INTERFACE WITH EACH OTHER AS INTENDED. BUSINESS CONTINUITY CAN ALSO BE DISRUPTED BY AN EVENT, SUCH AS A PANDEMIC, THAT RENDERS LARGE NUMBERS OF A WORKFORCE UNABLE TO WORK AS NEEDED, PARTICULARLY AT

CRITICAL LOCATIONS; FOR EXAMPLE, OUR LARGEST LOCATION EMPLOYS ABOUT 20% OF OUR EMPLOYEES. IF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, SYSTEM FAILURE OR

SERVICE DENIAL, THIS COULD RESULT IN A DETERIORATION OF OUR ABILITY TO WRITE AND PROCESS NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS, PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE, PAY CLAIMS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR PERFORM OTHER NECESSARY

BUSINESS FUNCTIONS.

OUR

OPERATIONS RELY ON THE RELIABLE AND SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. COMPUTER VIRUSES, HACKERS

(INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS, ORGANIZATIONS OR ROGUE STATES) AND EMPLOYEE OR VENDOR MISCONDUCT, AND OTHER EXTERNAL HAZARDS, COULD EXPOSE OUR DATA SYSTEMS TO SECURITY BREACHES, CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER

DISRUPTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY E-MAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION

CAPABILITIES WITH THIRD-PARTY VENDORS AND OTHERS WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE SECURE

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAPABILITIES

WITH ALL OF SUCH VENDORS AND THIRD PARTIES AND, IN ADDITION, THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION.

LIKE

OTHER GLOBAL COMPANIES, OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE REGULARLY SUBJECT TO AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE TARGET OF COMPUTER VIRUSES, MALWARE OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODES, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS,

CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER COMPUTER-RELATED PENETRATIONS. WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THREATS TO OUR DATA AND SYSTEMS, TO DATE, WE ARE NOT AWARE THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL CYBER-SECURITY BREACH.

HOWEVER, OVER TIME, THE SOPHISTICATION OF THESE THREATS CONTINUES TO INCREASE. OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL CONTROLS AS WELL AS OTHER PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CYBER

INCIDENTS AND PROTECT OUR INFORMATION MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO DETECT OR PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, OTHER PHYSICAL AND ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, CYBER-ATTACKS OR OTHER SECURITY BREACHES TO OUR COMPUTER

SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD RESULT IN GREATER OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY MAY FURTHER EXPOSE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO THE RISK OF

CYBER-ATTACKS.

WE

HAVE OUTSOURCED CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES AND MAY INCREASINGLY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MONITOR

OUR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, IF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS DO NOT PERFORM AS ANTICIPATED, IF WE EXPERIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH A TRANSITION, OR IF OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS RELEVANT TO

OUR BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS ARE TERMINATED, WE MAY NOT REALIZE EXPECTED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS OR COST EFFICIENCIES AND MAY EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, INCREASED COSTS AND A LOSS OF

BUSINESS. OUR OUTSOURCING OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED RISK RELATED TO DATA SECURITY, SERVICE DISRUPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

OUR CONTROL SYSTEM, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES OR HARM TO OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. SEE ALSO "WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR CONTROLS DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE

WITH GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE." IN ADDITION TO RISKS CAUSED BY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE IMPACTED BY CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, UNANTICIPATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR PUBLIC POLICY INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

THE

INCREASED RISKS IDENTIFIED ABOVE COULD EXPOSE US TO DATA LOSS, DISRUPTION OF SERVICE, MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES, COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN

COMPLIANCE COSTS AND COSTS TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY AND RESILIENCY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. THE COMPROMISE OF PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD ALSO SUBJECT US TO LEGAL LIABILITY

OR REGULATORY ACTION UNDER EVOLVING CYBER-SECURITY, DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY LAWS AND REGULATIONS ENACTED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, CANADA, THE EUROPEAN UNION OR OTHER

JURISDICTIONS OR BY VARIOUS REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS OR EXCHANGES. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MIGHT BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS OR IN THE TAX LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US.

TAX LAWS MAY CHANGE

IN WAYS THAT

ADVERSELY IMPACT US. FOR EXAMPLE, FEDERAL TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED TO REDUCE THE EXISTING STATUTORY U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35%, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDINGLY, REDUCE ANY U.S.

DEFERRED TAX ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF ANY NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS VOLATILE AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES. THE EFFECT OF A REDUCTION IN A TAX RATE ON NET

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED, IN FULL, AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN ENACTED AND, ALONG WITH OTHER CHANGES IN THE TAX RULES THAT MAY

INCREASE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL TAX EXPENSE, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, A REDUCTION IN THE EXISTING STATUTORY U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE

COULD INCREASE THE AFTER-TAX EFFECT OF FUTURE SIGNIFICANT LOSS EVENTS AND OUR AFTER-TAX BORROWING COSTS.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS BENEFITED FROM CERTAIN TAX EXEMPTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE GOVERNING DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED

DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH AS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). FEDERAL AND/OR STATE TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED IN CONNECTION WITH

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFICIT

REDUCTION OR VARIOUS TYPES OF FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM THAT WOULD LESSEN OR ELIMINATE SOME OR ALL OF THE TAX ADVANTAGES CURRENTLY BENEFITING US AND THEREFORE COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, SUCH LEGISLATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PARTICULARLY CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF INTEREST FROM MUNICIPAL BONDS

(WHICH COMPRISE 45% OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016), WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF THOSE BONDS.

OTHER

TAX LAW CHANGES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, BUDGET CONSTRAINTS FACED BY MANY STATES AND LOCALITIES INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL RAISE REVENUE BY ENACTING LEGISLATION INCREASING THE TAXES PAID BY INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY FEDERAL TAX REFORM THAT IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE

U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE IN A "REVENUE NEUTRAL" MANNER COULD INCLUDE OTHER PROVISIONS THAT MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR TAXABLE INCOME OR OTHERWISE INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. FOR

EXAMPLE, POTENTIAL TAX REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES COULD INCLUDE A DESTINATION-BASED, BORDER-ADJUSTABLE CONSUMPTION TAX SYSTEM AND/OR TARIFFS THAT COULD IMPACT THE COST OF REINSURANCE AND/OR IMPORTED

MATERIALS WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR LOSS COSTS.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OUTSIDE

THE UNITED

STATES PRIMARILY IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. IN ADDITION, WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN BRAZIL, PRIMARILY THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE,

AND WE HAVE AN INDIRECT INTEREST IN A JOINT VENTURE IN COLOMBIA. WE MAY ALSO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND OTHER EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS

INDIA.

IN

CONDUCTING BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL RISKS, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS

PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE LIMITS, OWNERSHIP LIMITS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE OR ANTI-COMPETITIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS OR REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION. A PORTION OF OUR PREMIUMS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES IS GENERATED IN CANADA, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF WHICH CONSISTS OF AUTOMOBILE PREMIUMS FROM THE PROVINCE OF

ONTARIO, WHICH IS A HIGHLY REGULATED MARKET. OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY ALSO SUBJECT US TO CURRENCY RISK AND, IN SOME MARKETS, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE THAT

RISK, OR WE MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE THAT RISK. IN ADDITION, IN SOME MARKETS, WE MAY INVEST AS PART OF A JOINT VENTURE WITH A LOCAL COUNTERPARTY. BECAUSE OUR GOVERNANCE RIGHTS MAY BE LIMITED, WE MAY

NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE ABILITY OF THE JOINT VENTURE TO MAKE CERTAIN DECISIONS AND/OR MITIGATE RISKS IT FACES, AND SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS WITH A JOINT VENTURE COUNTERPARTY MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT

OUR INVESTMENT AND/OR REPUTATION. OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS RESULTING FROM THE NEED TO RECOGNIZE AND SUBSEQUENTLY REVISE A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE ASSOCIATED WITH INCOME TAXES IF WE BECAME UNABLE TO FULLY UTILIZE ANY DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS FROM THOSE FOREIGN OPERATIONS. ALSO, POLITICAL INSTABILITY,

PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES, AND CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS AROUND THE GLOBE, COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN SUCH REGIONS.

OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND SIMILAR LAWS IN

OTHER COUNTRIES THAT PROHIBIT THE MAKING OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN OFFICIALS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POLICIES AND CONTROLS IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, IF THOSE

CONTROLS ARE INEFFECTIVE AND AN EMPLOYEE OR INTERMEDIARY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD SUFFER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND OUR BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SOME COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY EMERGING ECONOMIES, HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LACK CLARITY AND, EVEN WITH LOCAL EXPERTISE AND EFFECTIVE CONTROLS, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE

THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF, AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER, THE LOCAL LAWS. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING BRAZIL, PARTIES TO A JOINT VENTURE MAY, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, HAVE LIABILITY FOR SOME

OBLIGATIONS OF THE VENTURE,

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND

THAT LIABILITY MAY EXTEND BEYOND THE CAPITAL INVESTED. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT

NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESS IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY.

IN

ADDITION, COMPETITION FOR SKILLED EMPLOYEES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS AND OTHER NON-U.S. LOCATIONS MAY BE INTENSE. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HIRE, INTEGRATE, MOTIVATE AND RETAIN A SUFFICIENT

NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND NECESSARY FOR OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES, THOSE BUSINESSES AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

REGULATORY CHANGES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN CANADA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR

GROWTH.

INSURANCE LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND

MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR HIGHER COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND THUS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

IN

PARTICULAR, THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EXECUTIVE BODY, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, IMPLEMENTED NEW CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND RISK MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS CALLED SOLVENCY II ON JANUARY 1, 2016

THAT APPLY TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION. UNDER SOLVENCY II, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE U.S. PARENT OF A EUROPEAN UNION SUBSIDIARY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SOLVENCY II

REQUIREMENTS IF THE REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT THE SUBSIDIARY'S CAPITAL POSITION IS DEPENDENT ON THE PARENT COMPANY AND THE U.S. PARENT IS NOT ALREADY SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS DEEMED "EQUIVALENT" TO

SOLVENCY II. IN ADDITION, REGULATORS IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY HAS OPERATIONS ARE WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS (IAIS) (AND WITH THE NAIC, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE AND FIO IN THE U.S.) TO CONSIDER CHANGES TO INSURANCE COMPANY SUPERVISION, INCLUDING GROUP SUPERVISION AND GROUP CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE

IAIS HAS DEVELOPED A METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING "GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSURERS" (G-SIIS) AND HIGH LEVEL POLICY MEASURES THAT WILL APPLY TO THE G-SIIS. THE METHODOLOGY AND

MEASURES WERE ENDORSED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (FSB) CREATED BY THE G-20. USING THE IAIS METHODOLOGY, THE FSB, WORKING WITH NATIONAL AUTHORITIES AND THE IAIS, IDENTIFIED NINE INSURERS IN

NOVEMBER 2016 THAT THEY DESIGNATED AS G-SIIS. THE IAIS IS WORKING ON THE POLICY MEASURES WHICH INCLUDE HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ENHANCED SUPERVISION. THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS A

G-SII BY THE FSB; HOWEVER, THE FSB UPDATES THE LIST ANNUALLY, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE METHODOLOGIES COULD BE AMENDED OR INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE AND THE COMPANY COULD BE NAMED AS A

G-SII.

THE

IAIS IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR THE SUPERVISION OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS (COMFRAME). AS THE CURRENT DRAFT OF COMFRAME IS

COMPLETED, IT LIKELY WILL LEAD TO SIMILAR POLICY MEASURES AS THOSE BEING DEVELOPED FOR G-SIIS BEING MADE APPLICABLE TO INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS (OR "IAIGS"), INCLUDING GROUP

SUPERVISION, GROUP CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND RESOLUTION PLANNING, I.E., A WRITTEN PLAN DEVELOPED BY A FINANCIAL GROUP DETAILING HOW IT WOULD BE WOUND DOWN IN THE EVENT OF AN INSOLVENCY. THE

IAIS IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FIELD TESTING THE GROUP CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUP UNDER THE CURRENT CONSULTATION DRAFT. IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT COMFRAME, IF ADOPTED, COULD LEAD TO ENHANCED SUPERVISION AND HIGHER CAPITAL STANDARDS ON A GLOBAL BASIS IF THE IAIS, THE NAIC AND THE INDIVIDUAL STATES ADOPT THE PROPOSED OR SIMILAR

PROVISIONS.

WHILE

IT IS NOT YET KNOWN HOW OR IF THESE ACTIONS WILL IMPACT US, SUCH REGULATION COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS OF COMPLIANCE, INCREASED DISCLOSURE AND LESS FLEXIBILITY IN OUR CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOSS OF OR SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, SUCH AS CREDIT SCORING, OR OTHER DATA OR METHODOLOGIES, IN THE PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

OF

OUR PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

OUR UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO COMPETITIVELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AT A

LEVEL THAT WILL ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE US FOR THE RISKS ASSUMED. AS A RESULT, RISK SELECTION AND PRICING THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF ACTUARIALLY SOUND AND SEGMENTED UNDERWRITING CRITERIA IS CRITICAL.

HOWEVER, LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE FINDINGS, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL THE USE OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF UNDERWRITING CRITERIA. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY USE CREDIT SCORING AS A

FACTOR IN PRICING DECISIONS WHERE ALLOWED BY STATE LAW. SOME CONSUMER GROUPS AND/OR REGULATORS HAVE ALLEGED THAT THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING VIOLATES THE LAW BY DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PERSONS BELONGING

TO A PROTECTED CLASS AND ARE CALLING FOR THE PROHIBITION OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING. A VARIETY OF OTHER UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND OTHER DATA OR

METHODOLOGIES USED IN PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE CRITICIZED BY REGULATORS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CONSUMER GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS ON SIMILAR OR OTHER GROUNDS.

RESULTING REGULATORY ACTIONS OR LITIGATION COULD RESULT IN NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND/OR GENERATE ADVERSE RULES OR FINDINGS, SUCH AS CURTAILING THE USE OF IMPORTANT UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, OR OTHER DATA OR

METHODOLOGIES, EACH OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY RESULT IN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

FROM TIME

TO TIME WE MAY

INVESTIGATE AND PURSUE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES IF WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES AND THAT THE POTENTIAL REWARDS OF AN ACQUISITION JUSTIFY THE RISKS.

THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING AN ACQUIRED COMPANY OR BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, HOWEVER, AND MAY CREATE UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENDITURES. FOR EXAMPLE, ACQUISITIONS MAY PRESENT

SIGNIFICANT RISKS, INCLUDING.



THE POTENTIAL DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESS;



THE INEFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF, OR OTHER DIFFICULTIES WITH, UNDERWRITING, RISK MANAGEMENT, CLAIMS HANDLING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND

ACTUARIAL PRACTICES;



UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO AN ACQUIREE'S RESERVE ESTIMATES AND ITS DESIGN AND OPERATION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING;



THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO ACQUISITION INTEGRATION CHALLENGES;



THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES;



UNFORESEEN LIABILITIES;



DIFFICULTIES IN ACHIEVING THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN ACQUISITION, INCLUDING THE BUSINESS, FINANCIAL, TECHNOLOGICAL OR DISTRIBUTION

OBJECTIVES;



THE CULTURAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING EMPLOYEES; AND



THE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR CREDIT RATINGS.

ACQUIRED

BUSINESSES MAY NOT PERFORM AS PROJECTED, ANY COST SAVINGS AND OTHER SYNERGIES ANTICIPATED FROM THE ACQUISITION MAY NOT MATERIALIZE AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTEGRATION MAY

BE GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED. ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR DELAYS AND ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS MIGHT BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR CONTROLS DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS ARE NOT

EFFECTIVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE ON A DAILY BASIS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING, CLAIM PROCESSING AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX. THESE ACTIVITIES OFTEN ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNAL GUIDELINES AND POLICIES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM'S OBJECTIVES WILL

66

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BE

MET. IF OUR CONTROLS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, IT COULD LEAD TO FINANCIAL LOSS, UNANTICIPATED RISK EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK), ERRORS IN FINANCIAL REPORTING OR DAMAGE TO

OUR REPUTATION. SEE ALSO "IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA AND NETWORK SECURITY, OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, OR CLOUD-BASED TECHNOLOGY, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED."

IN

ADDITION, INEFFECTIVE CONTROLS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY JOINT VENTURES OR RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, COULD LEAD TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION. THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS AND

AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AND PENALTIES CLAIMED IN LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY OR

SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT. SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES

.    THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM

WITHIN THE

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN KEY POSITIONS AND THOSE POSSESSING HIGHLY SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE IN AREAS

SUCH AS UNDERWRITING, DATA AND ANALYTICS, TECHNOLOGY AND E-COMMERCE. OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS, EFFORTS AND PROPER CONDUCT OF HIGHLY-SKILLED INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING OUR SENIOR

EXECUTIVES (MANY OF WHOM HAVE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY), AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGULARLY ENGAGES IN SUCCESSION DISCUSSIONS. SEE "ITEM 10DIRECTORS,

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE" FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, INCLUDING OUR SENIOR LEADERS. FOR MANY OF OUR SENIOR POSITIONS, WE

COMPETE FOR TALENT NOT JUST WITH INSURANCE OR FINANCIAL SERVICE COMPANIES, BUT WITH OTHER LARGE COMPANIES AND OTHER BUSINESSES. OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES AND TO

EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR

EMPLOYEES, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND REPUTATION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE OUR OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS FOR INFRINGING THE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF OTHERS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TRADEMARKS, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

SEE "ITEM 1OTHER INFORMATIONINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY." WE MAY NOT, HOWEVER, BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE AND DISCLOSURE BY OTHERS.

FURTHER, THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS MAY NOT PREVENT OUR COMPETITORS FROM INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPING TRADEMARKS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS. MOREOVER, THE AGREEMENTS WE EXECUTE TO

PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE BREACHED, AND WE MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE REMEDIES IN RESPONSE. OUR ATTEMPTS TO PATENT OR REGISTER OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE U.S. AND

WORLDWIDE MAY NOT SUCCEED INITIALLY OR MAY LATER BE CHALLENGED BY THIRD PARTIES. FURTHER, THE LAWS OF CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS. WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE INITIATION OF EXPENSIVE AND PROTRACTED LITIGATION, AND WE MAY NOT PREVAIL. ANY

INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.

WE

MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES FROM TIME TO TIME THAT OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN RECENT YEARS, CERTAIN

ENTITIES HAVE ACQUIRED PATENTS IN ORDER TO ALLEGE CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT AGAINST COMPANIES, INCLUDING IN SOME CASES, US. ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US COULD CAUSE US

TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME AND MONEY TO DEFEND OURSELVES, REGARDLESS OF THE MERITS OF THE CLAIMS. IF WE ARE FOUND TO INFRINGE ANY THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, IT COULD RESULT IN

REPUTATIONAL HARM, PAYMENT OF SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES, PAYMENT OF LICENSE FEES (IF LICENSES ARE EVEN AVAILABLE TO US, ON REASONABLE TERMS OR OTHERWISE) AND/OR SUBSTANTIAL TIME AND EXPENSE TO

REDESIGN OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGIES TO AVOID THE INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WE USE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE IN SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TECHNOLOGIES.

IF ANY OF OUR SOFTWARE VENDORS OR LICENSORS ARE FACED WITH INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WE MAY LOSE OUR ABILITY TO USE SUCH SOFTWARE UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS RESOLVED. IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY

REDESIGN AN INFRINGING PRODUCT, SERVICE OR TECHNOLOGY (OR PROCURE A SUBSTITUTE VERSION), THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.

CHANGES IN FEDERAL REGULATION COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON US AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

THE DODD-FRANK WALL

STREET REFORM

AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2010 (THE DODD-FRANK ACT) ESTABLISHED A FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE (FIO) WITHIN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. THE FIO HAS LIMITED REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND IS

EMPOWERED TO GATHER DATA AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND INSURERS, BUT IT HAS IN THE PAST RECOMMENDED AN EXPANDED FEDERAL ROLE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. THE DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO GIVES

THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER A NUMBER OF NONBANK FINANCIAL SERVICES HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING INSURANCE COMPANIES, IF THEY ARE DESIGNATED BY A TWO-THIRDS VOTE OF A FINANCIAL

STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE FSOC) AS "SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS" (SIFI) OR OWN A BANK OR THRIFT. THE COMPANY, BASED UPON THE FSOC'S RULES AND INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE, HAS NOT

BEEN DESIGNATED AS A SIFI AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. NONETHELESS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FSOC MAY CHANGE ITS RULES OR INTERPRETATIONS IN THE FUTURE AND CONCLUDE THAT WE ARE

A SIFI. IF WE WERE DESIGNATED AS A SIFI, THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY COULD INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE HEIGHTENED FINANCIAL REGULATION AND COULD IMPACT REQUIREMENTS REGARDING OUR

CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE AS WELL AS OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT CONDUCT. THE DODD-FRANK ACT ALSO AUTHORIZES ASSESSMENTS TO PAY FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SIFI'S THAT HAVE BECOME INSOLVENT. WE (AS A

FINANCIAL COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN ASSETS) COULD BE ASSESSED, AND, ALTHOUGH ANY SUCH ASSESSMENT IS REQUIRED TO BE RISK WEIGHTED (I.E., RISKIER FIRMS PAY MORE), SUCH COSTS

COULD BE MATERIAL TO US AND ARE NOT CURRENTLY ESTIMABLE. AS A RESULT OF THE FOREGOING, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, INCLUDING ANY CHANGES THERETO AS A RESULT OF ITS CURRENT RE-EVALUATION OR OTHERWISE, OR OTHER

ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REGULATION THAT IS ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE, COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON US, INCLUDING IMPACTING THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, INCREASING COMPLIANCE COSTS AND

DUPLICATING STATE REGULATION, AND COULD RESULT IN A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE, PARTICULARLY RELATIVE TO OTHER COMPETITORS THAT MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LEVEL OF REGULATION.

EVEN

IF WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SECTOR REGULATORY REFORM, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON US. FOR EXAMPLE,

REGULATORY REFORM COULD HAVE AN UNEXPECTED IMPACT ON OUR RIGHTS AS A CREDITOR OR ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

OTHER

POTENTIAL CHANGES IN U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL REPEAL OF THE MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT (WHICH EXEMPTS INSURANCE FROM

MOST FEDERAL REGULATION) AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN FEDERAL TAXATION, COULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING US.

CHANGES TO EXISTING U.S. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPORTED RESULTS.

AS A U.S.-BASED SEC REGISTRANT, WE ARE

CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO

PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (U.S. GAAP), AS PROMULGATED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB), SUBJECT TO THE

ACCOUNTING RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). DURING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE SEC HAS BEEN EVALUATING WHETHER, WHEN AND HOW INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING

STANDARDS (IFRS) SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE U.S. FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEM, INCLUDING FOR COMPANIES SUCH AS US. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER WE WILL CHOOSE, OR BE REQUIRED, TO ADOPT IFRS

OR HOW THE ADOPTION OF IFRS (OR ANY FUTURE EFFORTS BY THE SEC TO CONVERGE U.S. GAAP AND IFRS) MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FUTURE. CHANGES IN U.S. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS,

PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT SPECIFICALLY APPLY TO PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY OPERATIONS, MAY IMPACT THE CONTENT AND PRESENTATION OF OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND COULD CAUSE INCREASED VOLATILITY IN REPORTED EARNINGS, RESULTING IN OTHER ADVERSE

IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY'S RATINGS AND COST OF CAPITAL, AND DECREASE THE UNDERSTANDABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AS WELL AS THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR REPORTED RESULTS WITH OTHER INSURERS.

THE

COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATIONS UNDER WHICH REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET, PURSUANT TO PRE-SET TRADING

PLANS MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 10B5-1 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. THE AUTHORIZATIONS DO NOT HAVE A STATED EXPIRATION DATE. THE

TIMING AND ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, EARNINGS, SHARE PRICE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES,

MAINTAINING CAPITAL LEVELS COMMENSURATE WITH THE COMPANY'S DESIRED RATINGS FROM INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, FUNDING OF THE COMPANY'S QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S

OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, OTHER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED FINANCINGS), MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED 9,045 SHARES FOR A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED

SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. THESE SHARES CONSISTED OF SHARES RETAINED TO COVER PAYROLL WITHHOLDING TAXES IN CONNECTION WITH THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS AND PERFORMANCE SHARE

AWARDS, AND SHARES USED BY EMPLOYEES TO COVER THE PRICE OF CERTAIN STOCK OPTIONS THAT WERE EXERCISED.

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS OF THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME AND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME ARE PRESENTED ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS. DISCUSSIONS OF THE COMPONENTS OF NET INCOME AND SEGMENT OPERATING

INCOME ARE PRESENTED ON A PRE-TAX BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. DISCUSSIONS OF EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE ARE PRESENTED ON A DILUTED BASIS.

OVERVIEW

DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE OF $10.28 IN 2016 DECREASED BY 6% FROM DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE OF $10.88 IN 2015. NET INCOME OF

$3.01 BILLION IN 2016 DECREASED BY 12% FROM NET INCOME OF $3.44 BILLION IN 2015. THE LOWER RATE OF DECREASE IN DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF SHARE REPURCHASES IN

RECENT PERIODS. THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE PRE-TAX IMPACTS OF (I) HIGHER CATASTROPHE LOSSES, (II) LOWER UNDERWRITING MARGINS EXCLUDING CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ("UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS"), (III) LOWER NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND (IV) LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

(V) HIGHER OTHER REVENUES AND (VI) HIGHER NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2016 AND 2015 WERE $877 MILLION AND $514 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NET FAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2016 AND 2015 WAS $771 MILLION AND $941 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOWER UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRIMARILY

RESULTED FROM (I) HIGHER LOSS ESTIMATES IN THE PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE FOR BODILY INJURY LIABILITY COVERAGES, (II) THE IMPACT OF LOSS COST TRENDS THAT MODESTLY

EXCEEDED EARNED PRICING IN BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE AND (III) HIGHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS NET PRE-TAX DECREASE IN INCOME WAS A RELATED

DECREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

DILUTED

NET INCOME PER SHARE OF $10.88 IN 2015 INCREASED BY 2% OVER DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE OF $10.70 IN 2014. NET INCOME OF $3.44 BILLION IN 2015 DECREASED BY 7% FROM NET

INCOME OF $3.69 BILLION IN 2014. THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE COMPARED WITH THE PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN NET INCOME REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF SHARE REPURCHASES IN RECENT

PERIODS. THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE PRE-TAX IMPACTS OF (I) LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME, (II) LOWER NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS, (III) A DECLINE IN OTHER

REVENUES AND (IV) SLIGHTLY LOWER UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (V) LOWER CATASTROPHE LOSSES. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2015 AND 2014 WERE $514 MILLION AND

$709 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN BOTH 2015 AND 2014 WAS $941 MILLION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS NET PRE-TAX DECREASE IN INCOME WAS A RELATED

DECREASE IN INCOME

TAX EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN 2015 WAS REDUCED BY $32 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS.

THE

COMPANY HAS INSURANCE OPERATIONS IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, AS WELL AS IN BRAZIL, PRIMARILY THROUGH A JOINT VENTURE. BECAUSE THESE OPERATIONS ARE

CONDUCTED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014, CHANGES IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAD THE IMPACT OF LOWERING THE REPORTED LINE ITEMS IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME BY INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS. THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S

NET INCOME OR BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE'S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE YEARS REPORTED.

REVENUES

EARNED PREMIUMS

EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2016 WERE $24.53 BILLION, $660 MILLION OR 3% HIGHER THAN IN 2015. IN BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE,

EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2016 INCREASED BY 1% OVER 2015. IN BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE, EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2016 WERE COMPARABLE TO 2015. IN PERSONAL INSURANCE, EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2016 INCREASED BY 8%

OVER 2015. EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2015 WERE $23.87 BILLION, $161 MILLION OR 1% HIGHER THAN IN 2014. IN EACH OF BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE AND BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE,

EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2015 WERE COMPARABLE TO 2014. IN PERSONAL INSURANCE, EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2015 INCREASED BY 2% OVER 2014.

FACTORS

CONTRIBUTING TO THE CHANGES IN EARNED PREMIUMS IN EACH SEGMENT IN 2016 AND 2015 COMPARED WITH THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS

THAT FOLLOW.

NET

INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2016 WAS $2.30 BILLION, $77 MILLION OR 3% LOWER THAN IN 2015. NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS IN 2016 WAS

$1.98 BILLION, $110 MILLION LOWER THAN IN 2015. THE DECREASE PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER LONG-TERM REINVESTMENT RATES AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET AND A MODESTLY LOWER AMOUNT OF FIXED

INCOME INVESTMENTS THAT WERE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANY'S $524 MILLION PAYMENT RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. LITIGATION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016. NET INVESTMENT

INCOME FROM SHORT-TERM SECURITIES IN 2016 WAS $29 MILLION, $17 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2015, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES. NET INVESTMENT INCOME GENERATED BY

NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS IN 2016 WAS $330 MILLION, $13 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2015, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RETURNS FROM PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

WITH THE INCREASE IN EARNED PREMIUMS. AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS IN 2015 WAS $1.16 BILLION, $10 MILLION OR 1% LOWER THAN IN 2014.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF $988 MILLION IN BOTH 2016 AND 2015 WERE COMPARABLE WITH THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN 2016 WAS $191 MILLION, $211 MILLION OR 52% LOWER THAN IN 2015, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE

$590 MILLION DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES IN 2016. INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN 2015 WAS $402 MILLION, $36 MILLION OR 10% HIGHER THAN IN 2014, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE

$101 MILLION INCREASE IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $4 MILLION REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS IN 2015.

COMBINED RATIO

THE COMBINED RATIO OF 95.1% IN 2016 WAS 8.5 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE COMBINED RATIO OF 86.6% IN 2015.

THE

LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 67.8% IN 2016 WAS 9.7 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 58.1% IN 2015. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN

2016 ACCOUNTED FOR 0.5 POINTS OF THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2016. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT PROVIDED 3.8 POINTS OF BENEFIT TO THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RATIO IN 2015. CATASTROPHE LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR 4.5 POINTS AND 3.6 POINTS OF THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS IN 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE UNDERLYING LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RATIO IN 2016 WAS 4.5 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2015 RATIO ON THE SAME BASIS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING (I) HIGHER LOSS ESTIMATES IN THE AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE FOR BODILY INJURY LIABILITY COVERAGES,

(II) THE TENURE IMPACT OF HIGHER LEVELS OF NEW BUSINESS IN RECENT YEARS IN THE AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE AND (III) A HIGHER LEVEL OF AUTOMOBILE BUSINESS RELATIVE TO HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER

BUSINESS.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 27.3% IN 2016 WAS 1.2 POINTS LOWER THAN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 28.5% IN 2015, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN EARNED

PREMIUMS.

THE

COMBINED RATIO OF 86.6% IN 2015 WAS 2.1 POINTS LOWER THAN THE COMBINED RATIO OF 88.7% IN 2014.

THE

LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 58.1% IN 2015 WAS 1.5 POINTS LOWER THAN THE 2014 RATIO OF 59.6%. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2015 AND 2014 PROVIDED 3.8

POINTS AND 2.4 POINTS OF BENEFIT TO THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO, RESPECTIVELY. CATASTROPHE LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR 3.6 POINTS AND 4.7 POINTS OF THE 2015 AND 2014 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RATIO, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2015 UNDERLYING LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO WAS 1.0 POINT HIGHER THAN THE 2014 RATIO ON THE SAME BASIS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING (I) THE TENURE IMPACT OF

HIGHER LEVELS OF NEW BUSINESS IN RECENT YEARS IN THE AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE AND (II) A HIGHER LEVEL OF AUTOMOBILE BUSINESS RELATIVE TO HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER BUSINESS.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 28.5% IN 2015 WAS 0.6 POINTS LOWER THAN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 29.1% IN 2014, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER COMMISSION EXPENSES.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS THAT HAVE EXPANDED

INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS

CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AND CONTINUES TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM THE COMPANY'S POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH

INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY). FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS INCLUDE CONTINUED INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS AND THE CONTINUED FOCUS BY

PLAINTIFFS ON DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION. THE FOCUS ON THESE DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO

HAVE SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES BY

INITIALLY DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. THE BANKRUPTCY OF MANY TRADITIONAL DEFENDANTS HAS

ALSO CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND

WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION ARE HAVING THEIR

HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET. PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF

ASBESTOS LITIGATION, CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENT PATTERNS EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE EXPERIENCE

ALSO HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER

PARTICIPATING INSURERS.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR

A PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED

AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDER'S FAVOR

AND OTHER COMPANY DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, THE COMPANY'S COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND

THE NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS SEEN A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE

ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

MANY

COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN

ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. THERE ALSO MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE A COURT MAY NOT APPROVE A PROPOSED

92

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SETTLEMENT,

WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FOR THE COMPANY. AS IN THE PAST, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN

ADDITION TO CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO

THE HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) HAD PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH A NUMBER OF THESE DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS (DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENTS). THE COMPANY HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN LITIGATION CONCERNING WHETHER ALL OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE

DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENTS HAD BEEN SATISFIED. ON JULY 22, 2014, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT RULED THAT ALL OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENTS HAD

BEEN SATISFIED. ON JANUARY 15, 2015, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED AN ORDER DIRECTING THE COMPANY TO PAY $579 MILLION TO THE PLAINTIFFS, COMPRISED OF THE $502 MILLION SETTLEMENT

AMOUNTS, PLUS PRE- AND POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST OF $77 MILLION, AND THE COMPANY MADE THAT PAYMENT IN 2015. FOR A FULL DISCUSSION OF THESE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND RELATED LITIGATION, SEE THE

"SETTLEMENT OF ASBESTOS DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION" SECTION OF NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY, COULD BE MADE IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS

BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THESE CLAIMS AND HAS RECEIVED FAVORABLE RULINGS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.

ON

JANUARY 29, 2009, THE COMPANY AND PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. (PPG), ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY 30 OTHER INSURERS OF PPG, AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO SETTLE ASBESTOS-RELATED COVERAGE

LITIGATION UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO PPG (THE "AGREEMENT"). THE AGREEMENT WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE MODIFIED THIRD AMENDED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION ("AMENDED PLAN") PROPOSED AS PART OF THE

PITTSBURGH CORNING CORP. (PCC, WHICH IS 50% OWNED BY PPG) BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED PLAN, WHICH WAS FILED ON JANUARY 30, 2009, PCC, ALONG WITH ENUMERATED OTHER COMPANIES

(INCLUDING PPG AS WELL AS THE COMPANY AS A PARTICIPATING INSURER), RECEIVE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE FROM CERTAIN ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS.

UNDER THE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAD THE OPTION TO MAKE A SERIES OF PAYMENTS OVER 20 YEARS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $620 MILLION TO THE TRUST CREATED UNDER THE AMENDED PLAN, OR IT COULD

ELECT TO MAKE A DISCOUNTED PAYMENT. ON JANUARY 7, 2016, THE REMAINING OBJECTIONS TO THE AMENDED PLAN WERE DISMISSED. ON APRIL 27, 2016, THE AMENDED PLAN BECAME EFFECTIVE AND ALL THE

REMAINING CONDITIONS TO THE AGREEMENT WERE SATISFIED. THE COMPANY FULLY SATISFIED ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE AGREEMENT BY MAKING A DISCOUNTED PAYMENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016. THE COMPANY'S PAYMENT

TOTALED $524 MILLION, OF WHICH $518 MILLION WAS RELATED TO ASBESTOS RESERVES. THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT WERE INCLUDED IN ITS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015.

BECAUSE

EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AT LEAST ANNUALLY. AMONG THE FACTORS

WHICH THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER IN THE COURSE OF THIS REVIEW ARE: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS

AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT

VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS;

AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE LIMIT AND

THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM.

93

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IN-DEPTH ASBESTOS CLAIM REVIEW, INCLUDING A REVIEW OF ACTIVE POLICYHOLDERS AND LITIGATION CASES FOR POTENTIAL PRODUCT AND

"NON-PRODUCT" LIABILITY, AND NOTED THE CONTINUATION OF THE FOLLOWING TRENDS.



CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS INVOLVING INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS ASBESTOS-RELATED ILLNESS, PRIMARILY

INVOLVING MESOTHELIOMA CLAIMS;



WHILE OVERALL PAYMENT PATTERNS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY STABLE, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN SEVERITY FOR CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS DUE TO THE

CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY; AND



CONTINUED MODERATE LEVEL OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCY ACTIVITY.

IN

THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE CATEGORY, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICYHOLDERS WITH ACTIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS, THE NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING ASBESTOS

CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS WITH OPEN ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BOTH GROSS AND NET ASBESTOS-RELATED PAYMENTS DECLINED SLIGHTLY WHEN COMPARED TO 2015. PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF

POLICYHOLDERS IN THIS CATEGORY CONTINUE TO BE INFLUENCED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WHERE INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS ASBESTOS-RELATED INJURY,

PRIMARILY MESOTHELIOMA, CONTINUE TO TARGET DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION.

THE

COMPANY'S QUARTERLY ASBESTOS RESERVE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANALYZES DEVELOPING PAYMENT PATTERNS AMONG POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE, AND ASSUMED REINSURANCE AND OTHER

CATEGORIES AS WELL AS PROJECTED REINSURANCE BILLINGS AND RECOVERIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE, YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY

EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS

ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES NOR HAVE THE COMPANY'S EVALUATIONS RESULTED IN ANY WAY OF DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY PAYMENT.

THE

COMPLETION OF THESE REVIEWS AND ANALYSES IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014 RESULTED IN $225 MILLION, $224 MILLION AND $250 MILLION INCREASES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE COMPANY'S

NET ASBESTOS RESERVES. IN EACH YEAR, THE RESERVE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF PROJECTED SETTLEMENT AND DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO A BROAD NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE CATEGORY DUE TO A HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY SURROUNDING MESOTHELIOMA CLAIMS. THIS INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATE OF PROJECTED

SETTLEMENT AND DEFENSE COSTS RESULTED FROM PAYMENT TRENDS THAT CONTINUE TO BE HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT DISCUSSED ABOVE. OVER THE PAST

DECADE, THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, HAS EXPERIENCED NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WITH REGARD TO ASBESTOS RESERVES, BUT THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT OVER THAT PERIOD THERE HAS BEEN A REDUCTION IN THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S OVERALL ASBESTOS EXPOSURE AS THE OVERALL ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT HAS EVOLVED FROM ONE DOMINATED BY

EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RISKS, PARTICULARLY COVERAGE DISPUTES RELATING TO POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHO WERE ASSERTING THAT THEIR CLAIMS WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THE AGGREGATE LIMITS CONTAINED

IN THEIR POLICIES, TO AN ENVIRONMENT PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A FREQUENCY OF LITIGATION RELATED TO INDIVIDUALS WITH MESOTHELIOMA. THE COMPANY'S OVERALL VIEW OF THE CURRENT UNDERLYING ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT

IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM RECENT PERIODS AND THERE REMAINS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

NET

ASBESTOS PAID LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSES IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014 WERE $708 MILLION, $770 MILLION AND $242 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NET PAYMENTS IN 2016 INCLUDED THE

PAYMENT OF THE $518 MILLION SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS RELATED TO PPG AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. NET PAYMENTS IN 2015 INCLUDED THE PAYMENT OF THE $502 MILLION SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE

SETTLEMENT OF ASBESTOS DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. APPROXIMATELY

THE

POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS CATEGORY INCLUDES STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS, COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS AND, WITH RESPECT TO TPC, WELLINGTON ACCOUNTS. RESERVES ARE BASED ON

THE EXPECTED PAYOUT FOR EACH POLICYHOLDER UNDER THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENT. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS ARE ARRANGEMENTS

UNDER WHICH POLICYHOLDERS AND/OR PLAINTIFFS AGREE TO FIXED FINANCIAL AMOUNTS TO BE PAID AT SCHEDULED TIMES. COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS REPRESENT AGREEMENTS WITH POLICYHOLDERS ON SPECIFIED AMOUNTS

OF COVERAGE TO BE PROVIDED. PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL MAXIMUMS AND ARE ONLY MADE WHEN VALID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED. WELLINGTON ACCOUNTS REFER TO THE 35 DEFENDANTS THAT ARE PARTIES TO

A 1985 AGREEMENT SETTLING CERTAIN DISPUTES CONCERNING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEIR ASBESTOS CLAIMS. MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF THE WELLINGTON AGREEMENT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF COVERAGE IN PLACE

ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED ON SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE AND THE TERMS UNDER WHICH THE COVERAGE CAN BE ACCESSED. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN 2016 THE COMPANY PAID A $518 MILLION

SETTLEMENT RELATED TO ASBESTOS-RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO PPG. THAT AMOUNT HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN THE POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS CATEGORY IN THE

FOREGOING TABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. AS ALSO DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN 2015 THE COMPANY PAID A $502 MILLION SETTLEMENT RELATED TO THE ASBESTOS DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION.

THE

HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE CATEGORY RELATES TO ALL OTHER POLICYHOLDERS AND ALSO INCLUDES IBNR RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR THE COSTS OF DEFENDING ASBESTOS-RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION.

IBNR RESERVES IN THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE CATEGORY INCLUDE AMOUNTS FOR NEW CLAIMS AND ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT ON EXISTING HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE POLICYHOLDERS, AS WELL AS RESERVES FOR CLAIMS

FROM POLICYHOLDERS REPORTING ASBESTOS CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND FOR POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH THERE IS, OR MAY BE, LITIGATION. POLICYHOLDERS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR THE ANNUAL HOME OFFICE REVIEW BASED

UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: A COMBINATION OF PAST PAYMENTS AND CURRENT CASE RESERVES IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED THRESHOLD (CURRENTLY $100,000), PERCEIVED LEVEL OF EXPOSURE, NUMBER OF REPORTED CLAIMS,

PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATIONS AND POTENTIAL "NON-PRODUCT" EXPOSURES, SIZE OF POLICYHOLDER AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD BY THE POLICYHOLDER. THE ASSUMED REINSURANCE AND

OTHER CATEGORY PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF REINSURANCE OF EXCESS COVERAGE, INCLUDING VARIOUS POOL PARTICIPATIONS.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AND CONTINUES TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF

THEIR ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO

RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN

REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS

HAVE INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY THE COMPANY

PRIOR TO THE MID-1980S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WHEN SUBMITTED, RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT

BY THE CLAIMANT FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

THE

RESOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES BY THE COMPANY GENERALLY OCCURS THROUGH SETTLEMENTS WITH POLICYHOLDERS AS OPPOSED TO CLAIMANTS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY STRIVES TO EXTINGUISH ANY

OBLIGATIONS IT MAY HAVE UNDER ANY POLICY ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER FOR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXTINGUISH ANY PENDING COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTE WITH THE POLICYHOLDER.

96

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIS

FORM OF SETTLEMENT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A "BUY-BACK" OF POLICIES FOR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE AGREEMENTS HAVE ALSO EXTINGUISHED ANY INSURANCE OBLIGATION

WHICH THE COMPANY MAY HAVE FOR OTHER CLAIMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ASBESTOS AND OTHER CUMULATIVE INJURY CLAIMS. THE COMPANY AND ITS POLICYHOLDERS MAY ALSO AGREE TO SETTLEMENTS WHICH EXTINGUISH

ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM KNOWN SPECIFIED SITES OR CLAIMS. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THESE AGREEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE INDEMNITIES AND HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S GENERAL

PURPOSE IN EXECUTING THESE AGREEMENTS IS TO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE AND ELIMINATE THE RISKS PRESENTED BY COVERAGE LITIGATION WITH THE POLICYHOLDER AND RELATED COSTS.

IN

ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS,

THE COMPANY GENERALLY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE AND RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS: THE NATURE

OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE

CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER

AVAILABLE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN

EACH JURISDICTION. THE EVALUATION OF THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY A POLICYHOLDER CAN CHANGE AS INFORMATION CONCERNING THAT POLICYHOLDER AND THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED IS DEVELOPED. CONVENTIONAL

ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES.

IN

ITS REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS: PAST SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS; CHANGING JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE TRENDS; ITS RESERVES FOR THE COSTS OF LITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL

COVERAGE MATTERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR POLICYHOLDERS WITH SMALLER EXPOSURES TO BE NAMED IN NEW CLEAN-UP ACTIONS FOR BOTH ON-AND OFF-SITE WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES; THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT;

THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL NEW CLAIMS BEYOND PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS; AND THE POTENTIAL HIGHER COSTS FOR NEW SETTLEMENTS.

THE

DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE EXTENT OF TIME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE ESTIMATE, IF ANY, OF THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM TO THE

COMPANY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND ARE DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE COOPERATION OF THE POLICYHOLDER IN PROVIDING CLAIM INFORMATION, THE PACE OF

UNDERLYING LITIGATION OR CLAIM PROCESSES, THE PACE OF COVERAGE LITIGATION BETWEEN THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY TO NEGOTIATE, IF APPROPRIATE,

A RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE PERTAINING TO THESE CLAIMS. BECAUSE THESE FACTORS VARY FROM CLAIM-TO-CLAIM AND POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY CANNOT PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE OF THE DURATION

OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM. HOWEVER, BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THESE CLAIMS, THE DURATION MAY VARY FROM MONTHS TO SEVERAL YEARS.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE NOTICES FROM POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME, FREQUENTLY UNDER POLICIES ISSUED PRIOR TO THE MID-1980S. THESE POLICYHOLDERS CONTINUE TO

PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE LOWER TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, IN MANY INSTANCES, CLEAN-UP COSTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT RISK-BASED

SITE ANALYSES AND MORE EFFICIENT CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED GENERALLY FAVORABLE TRENDS IN THE NUMBER OF NEW POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IN THE NUMBER OF PENDING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. HOWEVER, THE DEGREE TO WHICH THOSE FAVORABLE TRENDS HAVE CONTINUED HAS BEEN LESS

THAN ANTICIPATED. IN ADDITION, RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS HAS BEEN GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED, DRIVEN BY CLAIMS AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS. AS

A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $82 MILLION, $72 MILLION AND $87 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

97

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NET ENVIRONMENTAL PAID LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSES WERE $61 MILLION, $55 MILLION AND $84 MILLION IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016, APPROXIMATELY 93% OF THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $354 MILLION) WAS CARRIED IN A BULK RESERVE AND INCLUDED UNRESOLVED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, INCURRED

BUT NOT REPORTED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTES RELATING TO THESE CLAIMS. THE BULK RESERVE THE COMPANY CARRIES IS ESTABLISHED AND ADJUSTED BASED UPON THE

AGGREGATE VOLUME OF IN-PROCESS ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THOSE CLAIMS. THE BALANCE, APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY

$28 MILLION), CONSISTS OF CASE RESERVES.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DISCUSSED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT

TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS

DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS

ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE, AND/OR THE NUMBER OF, ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED, THE

EMERGENCE OF A GREATER NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS THAN ANTICIPATED AS A RESULT OF EXTENDED LIFE EXPECTANCIES RESULTING FROM MEDICAL ADVANCES AND LIFESTYLE IMPROVEMENTS, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR

EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

98

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLAIMS

IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO THE COMPANY'S

ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY

LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS. IN ADDITION, UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO

PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS ENVIRONMENT COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN

APPLICABLE LEGISLATION AND FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR JUDICIAL REFORMS ESTABLISHING MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR

THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE

RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER

PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER

DEVELOPMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT INSURANCE RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT

CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WERE $70.49 BILLION, OF WHICH 93% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, 1% IN EQUITY SECURITIES, 1% IN REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AND 5% IN OTHER INVESTMENTS. BECAUSE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS TO FUND FUTURE CLAIMS PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY

EMPLOYS A CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID, TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT,

TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL AND TAXABLE CORPORATE AND U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS.

THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WAS $60.52 BILLION. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY

INVESTMENTS, AND INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES ARE EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, BOTH INCLUDING AND EXCLUDING U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, WAS "AA2" AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND 2015. BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES REPRESENTED 2.9% AND 2.8% OF THE TOTAL FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE

DURATION OF FIXED MATURITIES AND SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WAS 4.2 (4.5 EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM SECURITIES) AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 3.9 (4.2 EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM SECURITIES) AT DECEMBER 31,

2015.

OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS

THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 INCLUDED $31.91 BILLION AND $31.41 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES WHICH ARE OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO). THE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO IS

DIVERSIFIED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND PUERTO RICO AND INCLUDES GENERAL OBLIGATION AND REVENUE BONDS ISSUED BY STATES, CITIES, COUNTIES, SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SIMILAR

ISSUERS. INCLUDED IN THE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 WERE $5.16 BILLION AND $6.06 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF PRE-REFUNDED BONDS, WHICH ARE BONDS FOR

WHICH STATES OR MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ESTABLISHED IRREVOCABLE TRUSTS, ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY COMPRISED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, WHICH WERE CREATED TO SATISFY THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENTS OF

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. THE IRREVOCABLE TRUSTS ARE VERIFIED AS TO THEIR SUFFICIENCY BY AN INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION AGENT OF THE UNDERWRITER, ISSUER OR TRUSTEE. ALL OF THE COMPANY'S HOLDINGS OF

SECURITIES ISSUED BY PUERTO RICO AND RELATED ENTITIES HAVE BEEN PRE-REFUNDED AND THEREFORE ARE DEFEASED BY U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES.

102

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY BASES ITS INVESTMENT DECISION ON THE UNDERLYING CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MUNICIPAL SECURITY. WHILE ITS MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO INCLUDES A NUMBER

OF SECURITIES THAT WERE ENHANCED BY THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF AN ISSUER DEFAULT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RELY ON ENHANCED CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS

PROVIDED BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE AS PART OF ITS INVESTING DECISIONS. OF THE INSURED MUNICIPAL SECURITIES IN THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, APPROXIMATELY 99% WERE

RATED AT "A3" OR ABOVE, AND APPROXIMATELY 96% WERE RATED AT "AA3" OR ABOVE, WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A LOSS OF THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE WOULD NOT RESULT IN A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE UNDERLYING CREDIT STRENGTH OF THE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S

ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITIES. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE UNDERLYING ISSUERS OF THESE SECURITIES WAS "AA2" AT DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE ENTIRE

MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO WAS "AA1" AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, WITH AND WITHOUT THE ENHANCEMENT PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE.

RATED

USING EXTERNAL RATING AGENCIES OR BY THE COMPANY WHEN A PUBLIC RATING DOES NOT EXIST. THE TABLE INCLUDES $350 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WHICH

HAVE THE HIGHEST RATINGS ISSUED BY EXTERNAL RATING AGENCIES FOR SHORT-TERM ISSUANCES. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS TABLE, THE SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, WHICH ARE RATED "A-1+" AND/OR "P-1," ARE INCLUDED AS "AAA"

RATED SECURITIES.

IN

ADDITION TO FIXED MATURITIES NOTED IN THE FOREGOING TABLE, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE TOTALING $146 MILLION TO PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS

(BOTH OF WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET) WHOSE PRIMARY INVESTING FOCUS IS ACROSS EUROPE. THE COMPANY HAS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TOTALING

$113 MILLION TO THESE PARTNERSHIPS. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS $4 MILLION OF NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK (INCLUDED IN EQUITY SECURITIES ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET) ISSUED

BY COMPANIES IN THE EUROZONE.

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS AND PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES

THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 INCLUDED $1.71 BILLION AND $1.98 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, INCLUDING PASS-THROUGH-SECURITIES AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS), ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK (EITHER

SHORTENING OR LENGTHENING OF DURATION). WHILE PREPAYMENT RISK FOR SECURITIES AND ITS EFFECT ON INCOME CANNOT BE FULLY CONTROLLED, PARTICULARLY WHEN INTEREST RATES MOVE DRAMATICALLY, THE COMPANY'S

INVESTMENT STRATEGY GENERALLY FAVORS SECURITIES THAT REDUCE THIS RISK WITHIN EXPECTED INTEREST RATE RANGES. THE COMPANY MAKES INVESTMENTS IN RESIDENTIAL CMOS THAT ARE EITHER GUARANTEED BY GNMA, FNMA

OR FHLMC, OR IF NOT GUARANTEED, ARE SENIOR OR SUPER-SENIOR POSITIONS WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE SECURITIZATIONS. BOTH GUARANTEED AND NON-GUARANTEED RESIDENTIAL CMOS ALLOCATE THE DISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS

FROM THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES AMONG DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BONDHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, NON-GUARANTEED RESIDENTIAL CMOS PROVIDE STRUCTURES THAT ALLOCATE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT LOSSES TO DIFFERENT CLASSES OF

BONDHOLDERS. SENIOR AND SUPER-SENIOR CMOS ARE PROTECTED, TO VARYING DEGREES,

104

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FROM

CREDIT LOSSES AS THOSE LOSSES ARE INITIALLY ALLOCATED TO SUBORDINATED BONDHOLDERS. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO PURCHASE CMO TRANCHES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OFFER THE MOST FAVORABLE

RETURN GIVEN THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ASSOCIATED RISKS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PURCHASE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN CMOS. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN RESIDENTIAL

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 3 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION MORTGAGES AND SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDED CMOS BACKED BY ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION

MORTGAGES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES WITH A COLLECTIVE FAIR VALUE OF $142 MILLION AND $185 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (COMPRISING LESS THAN 1% OF THE

COMPANY'S TOTAL FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AT BOTH DATES). THE COMPANY DEFINES SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AS INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY EXHIBIT ONE OR MORE OF THE

FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: LOW FICO SCORES, ABOVE-PRIME INTEREST RATES, HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS OR HIGH DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIOS. ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION SECURITIZATIONS ARE THOSE IN WHICH THE

UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES' REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT SCORE BUT DO NOT MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES' GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION, PROPERTY TYPE, DEBT

AND LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING ON THESE SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS HELD BY THE COMPANY WAS "BA3" AND "BA2" AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

BELIEVE THIS PORTFOLIO EXPOSES IT TO A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE PORTFOLIO'S RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND PROJECT LOANS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE COMPANY HELD COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (INCLUDING FHA PROJECT LOANS) OF

$938 MILLION AND $865 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS PORTFOLIO EXPOSES IT TO A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE PORTFOLIO'S RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE AND THE UNDERLYING CREDIT STRENGTH OF THESE SECURITIES. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES, SEE NOTE 3 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

EQUITY SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, REAL ESTATE AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THESE INVESTED ASSET CLASSES.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY ALSO INVESTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS

ARE NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITIES AND DERIVATIVES. THESE ASSET CLASSES HAVE HISTORICALLY PROVIDED A HIGHER RETURN THAN FIXED MATURITIES BUT ARE SUBJECT TO MORE VOLATILITY. AT BOTH

DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER INVESTMENTS WAS $3.45 BILLION.

SECURITIES LENDING

THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES NET INVESTMENT INCOME BY LENDING CERTAIN OF ITS INVESTMENTS TO

OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE COMPANY HAD $286 MILLION AND $269 MILLION OF SECURITIES ON LOAN, RESPECTIVELY, AS PART OF A

TRI-PARTY LENDING AGREEMENT. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY BALANCE OF SECURITIES ON LOAN DURING 2016 AND 2015 WAS $346 MILLION AND $268 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. BORROWERS OF THESE SECURITIES PROVIDE

COLLATERAL EQUAL TO AT LEAST 102% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES PLUS ACCRUED

105

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEREST.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCURRED ANY INVESTMENT LOSSES IN ITS SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014.

LLOYD'S TRUST DEPOSIT

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A LLOYD'S TRUST DEPOSIT, WHEREBY OWNED SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $97 MILLION AND

$140 MILLION HELD BY A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY, WERE PLEDGED INTO A LLOYD'S TRUST ACCOUNT TO PROVIDE A PORTION OF THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO

SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS AT LLOYD'S.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS.

FOR

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS WHERE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE COMPANY DID NOT REACH A DECISION TO IMPAIR, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY

TO HOLD SUCH INVESTMENTS TO A PROJECTED RECOVERY IN VALUE, WHICH MAY NOT BE UNTIL MATURITY.

PURCHASES

AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON CASH REQUIREMENTS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES INVESTMENTS TO

BE SOLD TO ACHIEVE ITS PRIMARY INVESTMENT GOALS OF ASSURING THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS TO OPTIMIZE INVESTMENT RETURNS, GIVEN THESE OBLIGATIONS.

CATASTROPHE MODELING

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY AND THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER MODELING PROCESSES, TO MAKE UNDERWRITING AND

REINSURANCE DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. THERE ARE NO INDUSTRY-STANDARD METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS FOR PROJECTING CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE. ACCORDINGLY, CATASTROPHE

ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY DIFFERENT INSURERS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE.

107

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS AND EVALUATES CHANGES IN THIRD-PARTY MODELS AND, WHEN NECESSARY, CALIBRATES THE CATASTROPHE RISK MODEL ESTIMATES DELIVERED VIA ITS

OWN PROPRIETARY MODELING PROCESSES. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, RECENT EVENTS, UNDERWRITING PRACTICES, MARKET SHARE ANALYSES, EXTERNAL SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS AND VARIOUS OTHER

FACTORS INCLUDING NON-MODELED LOSSES TO REFINE ITS PROPRIETARY VIEW OF CATASTROPHE RISK. THESE PROPRIETARY MODELS ARE CONTINUALLY UPDATED AS NEW INFORMATION EMERGES.

THE

TABLES BELOW SET FORTH THE PROBABILITIES THAT ESTIMATED LOSSES, COMPRISING CLAIMS AND ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES (BUT EXCLUDING UNALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES), FROM

A SINGLE EVENT OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME WILL EQUAL OR EXCEED THE INDICATED LOSS AMOUNTS (EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY), BASED ON THE PROPRIETARY AND

THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER MODELS UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY AT DECEMBER 31, 2016. FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE BASIS DESCRIBED BELOW THE TABLES, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THERE IS A ONE PERCENT CHANCE THAT THE

COMPANY'S LOSS FROM A SINGLE U.S. HURRICANE IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME WOULD EQUAL OR EXCEED $1.3 BILLION, OR 6% OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2016.

AN

EVENT THAT HAS, FOR EXAMPLE, A 2% LIKELIHOOD OF EXCEEDANCE IS SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS A "1-IN-50 YEAR EVENT." AS NOTED ABOVE, HOWEVER, THE PROBABILITIES IN

THE TABLE REPRESENT THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSSES FROM A SINGLE EVENT EQUALING OR EXCEEDING THE INDICATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME, NOT OVER A MULTI-YEAR TIMEFRAME. ALSO, BECAUSE THE

PROBABILITIES RELATE TO A SINGLE EVENT, THE PROBABILITIES DO NOT ADDRESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN ONE EVENT OCCURRING IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, AND, THEREFORE, THE AMOUNTS DO NOT ADDRESS POTENTIAL

AGGREGATE CATASTROPHE LOSSES OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME.

(2)

THE

PERCENTAGE OF COMMON EQUITY IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING (A) INDICATED LOSS AMOUNTS IN DOLLARS BY (B) TOTAL COMMON EQUITY EXCLUDING NET UNREALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES. NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY BOTH DISCRETIONARY AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE

OF OPERATING TRENDS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT USES THE PERCENTAGE OF COMMON EQUITY CALCULATED ON THIS BASIS AS A METRIC TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A SINGLE HURRICANE OR SINGLE

EARTHQUAKE ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION FOR PURPOSES OF MAKING UNDERWRITING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS.

THE

THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS IN THE TABLES ABOVE, WHICH ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY'S IN-FORCE PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE PROGRAM AT JANUARY 1,

2017, ARE NET OF

108

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REINSURANCE,

AFTER-TAX AND EXCLUDE UNALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN LESS THAN 10% OF LOSS ESTIMATES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S REINSURANCE, SEE

"ITEM 1REINSURANCE." THE AMOUNTS FOR HURRICANES REFLECT U.S. AND CANADIAN EXPOSURES AND INCLUDE PROPERTY EXPOSURES, PROPERTY RESIDUAL MARKET EXPOSURES AND AN ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN

NON-PROPERTY EXPOSURES. THE HURRICANE LOSS AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY'S CATASTROPHE RISK MODEL ESTIMATES AND INCLUDE LOSSES FROM THE HURRICANE HAZARDS OF WIND AND STORM SURGE. THE AMOUNTS FOR

EARTHQUAKES REFLECT U.S. AND CANADIAN PROPERTY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXPOSURES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE INCLUSION OF HURRICANE OR EARTHQUAKE LOSSES ARISING FROM OTHER GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS OR OTHER EXPOSURES WOULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS.

CATASTROPHE

MODELING RELIES UPON INPUTS BASED ON EXPERIENCE, SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND HISTORY. THESE INPUTS REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGES WHICH MAY

RESULT IN VOLATILITY IN THE MODELED OUTPUT. CATASTROPHE MODELING OUTPUT MAY ALSO FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR RISKS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF NORMAL PROBABILITY OR ARE OTHERWISE UNFORESEEABLE. CATASTROPHE

MODELING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE PORTION OF PURCHASED REINSURANCE THAT IS COLLECTIBLE AFTER A CATASTROPHIC EVENT, WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE MATERIALLY INCORRECT. CONSEQUENTLY, CATASTROPHE

MODELING ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. IN THE TABLES ABOVE, THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE LIKELIHOOD OF

EXCEEDANCE DECREASES. IN OTHER WORDS, IN THE CASE OF A RELATIVELY MORE REMOTE EVENT (E.G., 1-IN-1,000), THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT IS RELATIVELY LESS RELIABLE. ACTUAL LOSSES FROM AN

EVENT COULD MATERIALLY EXCEED THE INDICATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT. IN ADDITION, MORE THAN ONE SUCH EVENT COULD OCCUR IN ANY PERIOD.

MOREOVER,

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF MATERIAL LOSSES FROM OTHER THAN PROPERTY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGES ARISING OUT OF HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, AND IT IS EXPOSED

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES FROM PERILS OTHER THAN HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, SUCH AS TORNADOES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS, VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND OTHER

NATURALLY-OCCURRING EVENTS, SUCH AS SOLAR FLARES, AS WELL AS ACTS OF TERRORISM AND CYBER-RISK.



CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND

OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS PROVIDE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT INDICATIONS THAN ACTUAL RESULTS."

CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS

SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES HAVE UNDERSCORED THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE CLIMATE TRENDS AND CREATED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING

INSURERS' EXPOSURES TO FINANCIAL LOSS AS A RESULT OF CATASTROPHES AND OTHER WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, HURRICANE AND STORM SURGE ACTIVITY HAVE IMPACTED AREAS FURTHER INLAND THAN PREVIOUSLY

EXPERIENCED, AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES HAVE RESULTED IN LARGER POPULATIONS IN COASTAL AREAS WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO SEVERE STORMS, THUS EXPANDING THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL FOR LOSSES FROM

HURRICANES. ADDITIONALLY, BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TORNADO AND HAIL STORMS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN MORE VOLATILE DURING THE LAST DECADE. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO

INCREASED LOSSES FROM CATASTROPHES AND OTHER WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S CATASTROPHE MODELS MAY BE LESS RELIABLE DUE TO THE INCREASED UNPREDICTABILITY IN FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY

OF SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS OR OTHER EMERGING TRENDS IN CLIMATE CONDITIONS.

THE

COMPANY DISCUSSES HOW POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS MAY PRESENT OTHER ISSUES FOR ITS BUSINESS UNDER "RISK FACTORS" IN ITEM 1A OF THIS REPORT AND UNDER

"OUTLOOK." FOR EXAMPLE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

INCREASINGLY UNPREDICTABLE AND SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CLAIMS UNDER POLICIES ISSUED BY

THE COMPANY. SEE "RISK FACTORSCATASTROPHE LOSSES

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND

COST OF REINSURANCE" AND "OUTLOOKUNDERWRITING GAIN/LOSS."



CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD ALSO IMPACT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF ISSUERS OF SECURITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY INVESTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WATER

SUPPLY ADEQUACY COULD IMPACT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF BOND ISSUERS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES, AND MORE FREQUENT AND/OR SEVERE HURRICANES COULD IMPACT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF ISSUERS IN THE

SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES, AMONG OTHER AREAS. SEE "RISK FACTORSOUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR MATERIAL REALIZED

OR UNREALIZED LOSSES."



INCREASED REGULATION ADOPTED IN RESPONSE TO POTENTIAL CHANGES IN CLIMATE CONDITIONS MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY AND ITS CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE,

STATE INSURANCE REGULATION COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE PROPERTY EXPOSURES IN AREAS VULNERABLE TO SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE DRIVEN LOSSES. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT RISK BASED

PRICING, MODIFY POLICY TERMS OR REDUCE EXPOSURES TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO ADDRESS RISING LOSSES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES AND SMALLER SCALE WEATHER EVENTS (SHOULD THOSE INCREASED LOSSES OCCUR), ITS

BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE "RISK FACTORSCATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE." IN ADDITION, CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION COULD INCREASE THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS' COSTS OF DOING

BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, INSUREDS FACED WITH CARBON MANAGEMENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE LESS AVAILABLE CAPITAL FOR INVESTMENT IN LOSS PREVENTION AND SAFETY FEATURES WHICH MAY, OVER TIME,

INCREASE LOSS EXPOSURES. INCREASED REGULATION MAY ALSO RESULT IN REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, WHICH WOULD DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF INSURABLE ASSETS AND BUSINESSES.



THE FULL RANGE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. THROUGH THE COMPANY'S EMERGING ISSUES COMMITTEE

AND ITS COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY WORKS WITH ITS BUSINESS UNITS AND CORPORATE GROUPS, AS APPROPRIATE, TO IDENTIFY AND TRY TO ASSESS CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED LIABILITY

ISSUES, WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AND OFTEN HARD TO FULLY EVALUATE. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS EMERGING ISSUES, INCLUDING CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, TO CONSIDER POTENTIAL CHANGES TO ITS

MODELING AND THE USE OF SUCH MODELING, AS WELL AS TO HELP DETERMINE THE NEED FOR NEW UNDERWRITING STRATEGIES, COVERAGE MODIFICATIONS OR NEW PRODUCTS. SEE "RISK FACTORSTHE EFFECTS OF

EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN."

CERTAIN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS, WHICH ARE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SETTLE CERTAIN PERSONAL

PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE THE COMPANY DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE AMOUNT DUE FROM THE LIFE

INSURANCE COMPANY RELATED TO THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS A REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE AND THE RELATED CLAIM COST IS INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY FOR

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, AS THE COMPANY RETAINS THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IF IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PAY, THE COMPANY WOULD

RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF THE RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE IF, AND TO THE EXTENT, THE PURCHASED ANNUITIES ARE NOT COVERED BY STATE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE

COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY

PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPANY'S TOP FIVE GROUPS BY STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 (IN MILLIONS). ALSO

THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS THE RATINGS AND RELATED OUTLOOK ASSIGNED TO REINSURANCE COMPANIES AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES BY VARIOUS INDEPENDENT RATINGS AGENCIES IN ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF

ITS ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS.

OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES OUTLOOK INFORMATION FOR CERTAIN KEY DRIVERS OF THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL POSITION.

PREMIUMS.

THE COMPANY'S EARNED PREMIUMS ARE A FUNCTION OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS COMPRISE BOTH RENEWAL

BUSINESS AND NEW

BUSINESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED PREMIUM OVER THE LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING POLICIES. WHEN BUSINESS RENEWS, THE AMOUNT OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUSINESS MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE

(RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE) AS A RESULT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN RATE AND/OR INSURED EXPOSURES, WHICH THE COMPANY CONSIDERS AS A MEASURE OF UNITS OF EXPOSURE (SUCH AS THE NUMBER AND VALUE OF VEHICLES

OR PROPERTIES INSURED). NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FROM BOTH RENEWAL AND NEW BUSINESS, AND THEREFORE EARNED PREMIUMS, ARE IMPACTED BY COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

WHICH, PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE, AFFECT AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, POLICY ENDORSEMENTS AND MID-TERM CANCELLATIONS. PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET

CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THE STRUCTURE OF REINSURANCE PROGRAMS AND RELATED COSTS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES.

OVERALL,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS RETENTION LEVELS (THE AMOUNT OF EXPIRING PREMIUM THAT RENEWS, BEFORE THE IMPACT OF RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES) WILL REMAIN STRONG BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS DURING

2017. IN BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT DOMESTIC RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES DURING 2017 WILL REMAIN POSITIVE AND WILL BE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LEVELS ATTAINED IN

2016. GIVEN THE RELATIVELY SMALLER AMOUNT OF PREMIUM THAT THE COMPANY GENERATES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND THE TRANSACTIONAL NATURE OF SOME OF THOSE MARKETS, PARTICULARLY LLOYD'S,

INTERNATIONAL RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES DURING 2017 COULD BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER, BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH OR SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN THE LEVELS ATTAINED IN 2016. IN BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS THAT RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES WITH RESPECT TO MANAGEMENT LIABILITY BUSINESS DURING 2017 WILL REMAIN POSITIVE, BUT WILL BE LOWER THAN THE LEVELS ATTAINED IN 2016. WITH RESPECT TO SURETY

BUSINESS WITHIN BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME DURING 2017 WILL BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER

THAN THE LEVEL ATTAINED IN 2016. IN PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT AGENCY AUTO RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES DURING 2017 WILL REMAIN POSITIVE AND WILL BE HIGHER THAN THE LEVELS ATTAINED IN

2016, AND AGENCY HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES DURING 2017 WILL REMAIN POSITIVE AND WILL BE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LEVELS ATTAINED IN 2016. THE NEED FOR STATE REGULATORY APPROVAL

FOR

112

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES

TO PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRICES, AS WELL AS COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS, MAY IMPACT THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES.

PROPERTY

AND CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE DURING 2017 FOR NEW BUSINESS. IN EACH OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS SEGMENTS, NEW BUSINESS GENERALLY HAS

LESS OF AN IMPACT ON UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY THAN RENEWAL BUSINESS, GIVEN THE VOLUME OF NEW BUSINESS RELATIVE TO RENEWAL BUSINESS. HOWEVER, IN PERIODS OF MEANINGFUL INCREASES IN NEW BUSINESS,

DESPITE ITS POSITIVE IMPACT ON UNDERWRITING GAINS OVER TIME, THE IMPACT OF HIGHER NEW BUSINESS LEVELS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMBINED RATIO IN THE SHORT-TERM.

GENERAL

ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING A VARIETY OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MATTERS, SUCH AS THE POLITICAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, THE U.S. FEDERAL BUDGET AND

POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TAX LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE REPEAL, REPLACEMENT OR MODIFICATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE

UNITED KINGDOM'S EXPECTED WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, RAPID CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, SUCH AS IN OIL, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, HAS ADDED TO

THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY. IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, THE RESULTING LOWER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD IMPACT EXPOSURE CHANGES AT RENEWAL AND THE COMPANY'S

ABILITY TO WRITE BUSINESS AT ACCEPTABLE RATES. ADDITIONALLY, LOWER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, POLICY ENDORSEMENTS AND MID-TERM CANCELLATIONS AFTER

POLICIES ARE WRITTEN. ALL OF THE FOREGOING, IN TURN, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2017, AND BECAUSE EARNED PREMIUMS ARE A FUNCTION OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS, EARNED PREMIUMS COULD BE

ADVERSELY IMPACTED ON A LAGGING BASIS.

UNDERWRITING GAIN/LOSS.

THE COMPANY'S UNDERWRITING GAIN/LOSS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND NET FAVORABLE OR

UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS.

CATASTROPHE

AND NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF SIGNIFICANT

CATASTROPHE AND NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES WERE TO OCCUR.

FOR

A NUMBER OF YEARS, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS HAVE INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER,

GIVEN THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY IN ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, LOSS EXPERIENCE COULD DEVELOP SUCH THAT THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES HIGHER OR LOWER LEVELS OF FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, NO FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OR UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, THE ONGOING REVIEW OF PRIOR YEAR CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, OR OTHER CHANGES IN CURRENT PERIOD CIRCUMSTANCES, MAY RESULT IN THE COMPANY REVISING CURRENT YEAR LOSS ESTIMATES UPWARD OR DOWNWARD IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE CURRENT YEAR.

IT

IS POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO HIGHER INFLATION THAN THE COMPANY HAD ANTICIPATED, WHICH COULD IN TURN LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANY'S LOSS COSTS

AND THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES. THESE IMPACTS OF INFLATION ON LOSS COSTS AND CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES COULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED FOR THOSE

LINES OF BUSINESS THAT ARE CONSIDERED "LONG TAIL", SUCH AS GENERAL LIABILITY, AS THEY REQUIRE A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION, SEE "PART IITEM 1ARISK FACTORSIF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED OUR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED

LEVEL OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE NECESSARY, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY

OPERATES, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED," AND "CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS OR IN THE TAX LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US."

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS AND THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO DURING 2017 WILL BE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH THOSE IN 2016,

REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF LOSS TRENDS IN EXCESS OF EARNED PRICING, LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER (AND MORE NORMALIZED) LEVELS OF NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES.

IN

BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS AND THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO DURING 2017 WILL BE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH THOSE IN 2016.

IN

PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS DURING 2017 WILL BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IN 2016 AND THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO DURING 2017 WILL BE BROADLY

CONSISTENT WITH 2016. IN AGENCY AUTOMOBILE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS AND THE UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO WILL IMPROVE IN 2017 COMPARED WITH 2016, REFLECTING ACTIONS TAKEN

TO IMPROVE PROFITABILITY THAT WILL EARN IN INCREASINGLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN AGENCY HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT UNDERLYING UNDERWRITING MARGINS WILL BE SLIGHTLY LOWER AND THE

UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO WILL BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN 2017 THAN IN THE 2016, REFLECTING HIGHER (AND MORE

NORMALIZED) LEVELS OF LOSS ACTIVITY. ALSO IN PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE COMPANY'S DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE, THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL THAT THE COMPANY LAUNCHED IN 2009, WHILE INTENDED TO ENHANCE THE

COMPANY'S LONG-TERM ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN A CONSUMER-DRIVEN MARKETPLACE, IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN MODEST WITH RESPECT TO PREMIUM VOLUME AND REMAIN UNPROFITABLE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AS THIS

BOOK OF BUSINESS GROWS AND MATURES.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ITS INVESTMENT STRATEGY ON MAINTAINING A HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND A

RELATIVELY SHORT AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION. THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF FIXED MATURITIES AND SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WAS 4.2 (4.5 EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM SECURITIES) AT DECEMBER 31, 2016.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS TO MANAGE THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE COMPANY HAD

$400 MILLION NOTIONAL VALUE OF OPEN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES ITS INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES AND MIX. CURRENTLY, THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS

ARE COMPRISED OF A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY, LIQUID, TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL AND TAXABLE CORPORATE AND U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS.

THE

COMPANY ALSO INVESTS MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES. THESE

INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER DEGREES OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND LESS LIQUIDITY.

NET

INVESTMENT INCOME IS A MATERIAL CONTRIBUTOR TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH INTEREST RATES INCREASED IN THE LATTER PART OF 2016, THEY REMAIN AT VERY LOW LEVELS BY

HISTORICAL STANDARDS. BASED ON THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE IMPACT OF LOWER REINVESTMENT YIELDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF A SLIGHTLY HIGHER LEVEL OF

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, COULD, DURING 2017, RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION TO $20 MILLION OF LOWER AFTER-TAX NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THAT PORTFOLIO ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AS

COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING QUARTERS OF 2016. NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN 2016 WAS HIGHER THAN IN 2015. THE IMPACT OF FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS ON NET

INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DURING 2017 IS HARD TO PREDICT. IF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND/OR INVESTMENT MARKET CONDITIONS DETERIORATE DURING 2017, THE

COMPANY COULD EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND/OR SIGNIFICANT REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES, INCLUDING IMPAIRMENTS.

THE

COMPANY HAD A NET PRE-TAX UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN OF $865 MILLION ($569 MILLION AFTER-TAX) IN ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2016.

WHILE THE COMPANY DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO PREDICT FUTURE INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS, A RISING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WOULD REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, AND A DECLINING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WOULD HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECTS. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS BENEFITED

114

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FROM

CERTAIN TAX EXEMPTIONS (PRIMARILY THOSE RELATED TO INTEREST FROM MUNICIPAL BONDS) AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE GOVERNING DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS AND TAX

CREDITS (SUCH AS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). CHANGES IN THESE LAWS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. SEE "CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAWS OR IN THE TAX LAWS OF OTHER

CAPITAL POSITION.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS A STRONG CAPITAL POSITION AND, AS PART OF ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE,

EXPECTS TO

CONTINUE TO RETURN CAPITAL NOT NEEDED TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT, GENERALLY OVER TIME, THE COMBINATION OF DIVIDENDS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND

COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES WILL LIKELY NOT EXCEED OPERATING INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE TIMING AND ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, EARNINGS, SHARE PRICE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES, MAINTAINING CAPITAL LEVELS COMMENSURATE WITH THE COMPANY'S DESIRED RATINGS FROM INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES,

FUNDING OF THE COMPANY'S QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, OTHER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED FINANCINGS), MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2016, SEE "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES."

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, PRIMARILY IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM (INCLUDING LLOYD'S), THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND BRAZIL, THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL IS ALSO

SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. FOR EXAMPLE, STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN COMPARISON TO OTHER CURRENCIES COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF SHAREHOLDERS'

EQUITY. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURE, SEE "PART IIITEM 7AQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK."

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO MEET THE CASH REQUIREMENTS OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND TO

SATISFY GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES WHEN NEEDED.

OPERATING COMPANY LIQUIDITY.

THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED

FROM PREMIUMS,

FEES, INCOME RECEIVED ON INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT MATURITIES. CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. THE

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES' LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CATASTROPHE CLAIMS, WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AS WELL AS THE TIMING AND

AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE RECOVERIES, WHICH MAY BE AFFECTED BY

REINSURER SOLVENCY AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE DISPUTES. ADDITIONALLY, THE VARIABILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIM PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS THE VOLATILITY OF POTENTIAL JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS ARISING OUT OF

LITIGATION, MAY ALSO RESULT IN INCREASED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT THAT THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES' FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS WILL BE ADEQUATELY MET FROM ALL

OF THE SOURCES DESCRIBED ABOVE. SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED, THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES PAY DIVIDENDS TO

THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENT COMPANIES, WHICH IN TURN PAY DIVIDENDS TO THE CORPORATE HOLDING (PARENT) COMPANY (TRV). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS PAID BY THE COMPANY'S

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, SEE "PART IITEM 1REGULATION."

HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY.

TRV'S LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS, DEBT SERVICING, COMMON SHARE

REPURCHASES AND, FROM

TIME TO TIME, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, TRV HELD TOTAL CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTED ASSETS IN THE UNITED STATES AGGREGATING

$1.68 BILLION AND HAVING A WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF 81 DAYS. TRV HAS ESTABLISHED A HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY TARGET EQUAL TO ITS ESTIMATED ANNUAL PRE-TAX INTEREST EXPENSE AND COMMON

SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS (CURRENTLY APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION). TRV'S HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY OF $1.68 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 EXCEEDED THIS TARGET AND IT IS THE OPINION OF

THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT THAT THESE ASSETS ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET TRV'S CURRENT LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.

TRV

IS NOT DEPENDENT ON DIVIDENDS OR OTHER FORMS OF REPATRIATION FROM ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS. U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED ON

$358 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS' UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, AS SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE OPERATIONS.

FURTHERMORE, TAXES PAID TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ON THESE EARNINGS MAY BE USED AS CREDITS AGAINST THE U.S. TAX ON DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE HOLDING COMPANY.

THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED TAXES ON THOSE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY AT DECEMBER 31,

2016.

TRV

HAS A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION THAT EXPIRES ON JUNE 17, 2019 WHICH PERMITS IT TO ISSUE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME. TRV

ALSO HAS A $1.0 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT FACILITY WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT EXPIRES ON JUNE 7, 2018. THIS LINE OF CREDIT ALSO SUPPORTS TRV'S $800 MILLION

COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, OF WHICH $100 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2016. TRV IS NOT RELIANT ON ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM TO MEET ITS OPERATING CASH FLOW NEEDS.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZED UNCOLLATERALIZED LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED BY MAJOR BANKS WITH AN AGGREGATE LIMIT OF APPROXIMATELY $179 MILLION, TO PROVIDE A PORTION OF THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO

SUPPORT ITS OBLIGATIONS AT LLOYD'S AT DECEMBER 31, 2016. IF UNCOLLATERALIZED LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE PRICE OR AT ALL IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY CAN COLLATERALIZE

THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT OR MAY HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF SUPPORTING ITS OBLIGATIONS AT LLOYD'S, WHICH COULD INCLUDE UTILIZING HOLDING COMPANY FUNDS ON HAND.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE $4.20 BILLION, $3.43 BILLION AND $3.69 BILLION IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014,

RESPECTIVELY. CASH FLOWS IN 2016 REFLECTED HIGHER LEVELS OF COLLECTED PREMIUMS, PROCEEDS FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF A REINSURANCE DISPUTE AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND LOWER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LEVELS OF PAYMENTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND

COMMISSION EXPENSES. THE HIGHER LEVEL OF PAYMENTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2016 INCLUDED THE COMPANY'S $524 MILLION PAYMENT RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE PPG

INDUSTRIES, INC. LITIGATION AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTION. CASH FLOWS IN 2015 INCLUDED THE COMPANY'S $579 MILLION PAYMENT RELATED TO THE

SETTLEMENT OF THE ASBESTOS DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND A LOWER LEVEL OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF COLLECTED PREMIUMS AND A LOWER CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMPANY'S QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN. CASH FLOWS IN 2014 PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER LEVELS OF PAYMENTS FOR

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND COMMISSION EXPENSES, AS WELL AS HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LEVELS OF COLLECTED PREMIUMS. THESE

INCREASES IN 2014 INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY (DOMINION). IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS

TOTALING $200 MILLION, $100 MILLION AND $200 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO ITS QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN. THE QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN WAS 101% AND 96% FUNDED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.46 BILLION IN 2016, COMPARED WITH NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF

$317 MILLION AND $206 MILLION IN 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 INCREASED BY $18 MILLION, OR LESS THAN 1%

FROM YEAR-END 2015, PRIMARILY REFLECTING NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, LARGELY

OFFSET BY COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES, A DECREASE IN THE UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS AND DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS. THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31,

2015 DECREASED BY $2.79 BILLION, OR 4% FROM YEAR-END 2014, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECREASE IN THE UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS, COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS PAID TO

SHAREHOLDERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

THE

COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO SUPPORT ITS INSURANCE OPERATIONS; ACCORDINGLY, THE PORTFOLIO IS POSITIONED TO MEET OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS. AS SUCH, THE PRIMARY

GOALS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS ARE TO SATISFY THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER FLUCTUATIONS IN PROJECTED LIABILITY CASH FLOWS. GENERALLY,

THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO ADEQUATELY FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EXACT

CASH FLOW MATCH IN EACH PERIOD, THE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT BY WHICH THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW

FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUND CLAIM PAYMENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS CREDIT

FACILITIES.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE $2.81 BILLION, $3.73 BILLION AND $3.81 BILLION IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014,

RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTALS IN EACH YEAR PRIMARILY REFLECTED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES AND

REPURCHASES TOTALING $2.40 BILLION UNDER THE COMPANY'S SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION, A DECREASE IN NET UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS OF $559 MILLION AND SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS

OF $762 MILLION, LARGELY OFFSET BY NET INCOME OF $3.01 BILLION.

THE

DEBT-TO-TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO EXCLUDING NET UNREALIZED GAIN ON INVESTMENTS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING (A) DEBT BY (B) TOTAL CAPITALIZATION EXCLUDING NET UNREALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS, NET OF TAXES. NET UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY BOTH INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, IN THE

OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, THE DEBT-TO-TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO CALCULATED ON THIS BASIS PROVIDES ANOTHER USEFUL METRIC FOR INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL LEVERAGE POSITION. THE

COMPANY'S RATIO OF DEBT-TO-TOTAL CAPITAL (EXCLUDING AFTER-TAX NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS) OF 22.3% AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WAS WITHIN THE COMPANY'S TARGET RANGE OF 15% TO 25%.

CREDIT AGREEMENT.

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO A FIVE-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS

THAT EXPIRES ON JUNE 7, 2018. TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SHELF REGISTRATION.

THE COMPANY HAS FILED A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION THAT

EXPIRES ON

JUNE 17, 2019 FOR THE POTENTIAL OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES. THE COMPANY MAY OFFER THESE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF OFFERING.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE COMPANY HAD $934 MILLION OF CAPACITY REMAINING UNDER ITS SHARE

AUTHORIZATION APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ESTIMATED CLAIMS

AND CLAIM-RELATED PAYMENTS. THE TABLE EXCLUDES SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS AND INCLUDES ONLY LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED IN CASH.

THE

TABLE BELOW INCLUDES THE AMOUNT AND ESTIMATED FUTURE TIMING OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM-RELATED PAYMENTS. THE AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE EXACT LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT ESTIMATES,

GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST BASED ON

THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY, FREQUENCY, LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS.

VARIABLES IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION OR DEFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND

LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. MANY OF THESE ITEMS ARE NOT DIRECTLY QUANTIFIABLE, PARTICULARLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE MAY

120

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BE

SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND THE TIME IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER. THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE TABLE

BELOW REQUIRED ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT (INCLUDING SEVERITY CONSIDERATIONS) AND TIMING. AMOUNT AND TIMING ARE FREQUENTLY ESTIMATED SEPARATELY. AN ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS RELATED TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM-RELATED PAYMENTS HAS UNAVOIDABLE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

THE

COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES AND PROTECT ITS CAPITAL AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN

ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING, A REINSURANCE AGREEMENT MUST INDEMNIFY THE INSURER FROM INSURANCE RISK, I.E., THE AGREEMENT MUST TRANSFER AMOUNT AND TIMING RISK. SINCE THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH INFLOWS FROM SUCH REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES BY THE INSURER, REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE LIABILITIES (THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES) RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING REINSURED CONTRACTS. THE PRESENCE OF ANY FEATURE

THAT CAN DELAY TIMELY REIMBURSEMENT OF CLAIMS BY A REINSURER RESULTS IN THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DEPOSIT RATHER THAN REINSURANCE. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT

AND TIMING OF THE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE USED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE RELATED LIABILITIES.

BELOW THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, NET OF THE ESTIMATED RECOVERY OF THE DEDUCTIBLE. THE LIABILITY AND THE RELATED DEDUCTIBLE RECEIVABLE FOR UNPAID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

"CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES" AND "CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES," RESPECTIVELY. MOST DEDUCTIBLES FOR SUCH POLICIES ARE PAID DIRECTLY FROM THE POLICYHOLDER'S ESCROW WHICH IS PERIODICALLY REPLENISHED BY THE

POLICYHOLDER. THE PAYMENT OF THE LOSS AMOUNTS ABOVE THE DEDUCTIBLE ARE REPORTED WITHIN "CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES" IN THE ABOVE TABLE. BECAUSE THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF THE DEDUCTIBLE

(CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES) OCCURS SHORTLY AFTER THE PAYMENT OF THE DEDUCTIBLE TO A CLAIMANT (CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES), THESE CASH FLOWS OFFSET EACH OTHER IN THE TABLE.

THE

ESTIMATED TIMING OF THE PAYMENT OF THE CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES AND THE COLLECTION OF CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES FOR WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICIES IS PRESENTED BELOW.

THE

AMOUNTS IN "LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS" RELATE TO ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS OF SECOND-INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM PAYMENT OF CURRENT CLAIM

LIABILITIES. SECOND INJURY FUNDS COVER THE COST OF ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. FOR LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS, THE COST IS SHARED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND

SELF-INSUREDS, FUNDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SELF-INSUREDS BASED ON LOSSES. AMOUNTS RELATING TO SECOND-INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN "OTHER LIABILITIES" IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE

COMPANY'S CURRENT LIABILITIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ARE $534 MILLION. OFFSETTING THESE LIABILITIES ARE

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $491 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES THAT WOULD EXIST IF THESE POSITIONS BECOME REALIZED.

THE

ABOVE TABLE DOES NOT INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF LIABILITIES REPORTED FOR STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT

OF DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY ISSUING THE ANNUITY. THE COMPANY IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO INCUR MATERIAL FUTURE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY

SUBJECT TO ANY MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR ITS QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. ACCORDINGLY, FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FOREGOING TABLE.

DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT. THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF CONNECTICUT

APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRES NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND THAT, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE

123

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GREATER

OF 10% OF THE INSURER'S STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURER'S NET INCOME FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31,

IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND BY STATE REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME

INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE RESTRICTIVE, LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. A MAXIMUM OF $3.69 BILLION IS AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2017 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS TO THE HOLDING COMPANY, TRV, WITHOUT

PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE TO ACCELERATE THE TIMING WITHIN 2017 AND/OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2017,

WHICH COULD RESULT IN CERTAIN DIVIDENDS BEING SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.

IN

ADDITION TO THE REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE PAID BY THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE

PAID TO THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS IS LIMITED, TO A LESSER DEGREE, BY CERTAIN COVENANTS CONTAINED IN ITS LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

MAINTAIN A

MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TRV

IS NOT DEPENDENT ON DIVIDENDS OR OTHER FORMS OF REPATRIATION FROM ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN

OPERATIONS ARE NOT MATERIAL AND ARE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE OPERATIONS.

TRV

AND ITS TWO NON-INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES RECEIVED DIVIDENDS OF $3.05 BILLION, $3.75 BILLION AND $4.10 BILLION FROM THEIR U.S. INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY SPONSORS A QUALIFIED NON-CONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN (THE QUALIFIED PLAN), WHICH COVERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

DOMESTIC EMPLOYEES AND PROVIDES BENEFITS PRIMARILY UNDER A CASH BALANCE FORMULA. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SPONSORS A NONQUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WHICH COVERS CERTAIN HIGHLY-COMPENSATED

EMPLOYEES, PENSION PLANS FOR EMPLOYEES OF ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AND A POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES SATISFYING CERTAIN AGE AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND FOR

CERTAIN RETIREES.

THE

QUALIFIED PLAN IS SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME ACT OF 1974 AS AMENDED (ERISA), WHICH REQUIRES PLANS TO MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS OF FUNDING AND REQUIRES

SUCH PLANS TO SUBSCRIBE TO PLAN TERMINATION INSURANCE THROUGH THE PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION (PBGC). THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENT FOR THE QUALIFIED PLAN FOR 2017

AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE HAVING A MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENT IN 2018. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION IN MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THOSE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014, THERE WAS NO MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENT FOR THE QUALIFIED PLAN. IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $200 MILLION,

$100 MILLION AND $200 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE QUALIFIED PLAN. IN DETERMINING FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS, THE COMPANY WILL CONSIDER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PLAN'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE

EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATES ON THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE PLAN AND THE COMPANY'S OTHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT ADDITIONAL VOLUNTARY FUNDING WILL

BE MADE IN 2017. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES, SUBJECT TO ACTUAL PLAN PERFORMANCE AND FUNDED STATUS AT THE TIME, THAT IT MAY MAKE VOLUNTARY PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY

$75 MILLION TO $100 MILLION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN 2017.

124

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2016, THE COMPANY BEGAN USING A FULL YIELD-CURVE APPROACH IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS FOR ITS

QUALIFIED AND NONQUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS AND ITS DOMESTIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. FOR A FULL DISCUSSION OF THE RATIONALE AND IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE IN APPROACH, SEE NOTE 14 OF

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE COMPANY UPDATED ITS MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS FOR ESTIMATING ITS QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN LIABILITIES UTILIZING NEW MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALES

ISSUED BY THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES. THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALES DECREASED THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $32 MILLION AND $57 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS ARE MANAGED TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM TOTAL RETURN WHILE MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RISK. THE COMPANY'S OVERALL STRATEGY IS TO ACHIEVE A MIX OF

APPROXIMATELY 85% TO 90% OF INVESTMENTS FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND 10% TO 15% FOR NEAR-TERM BENEFIT PAYMENTS WITH A DIVERSIFICATION OF ASSET TYPES, FUND STRATEGIES AND FUND MANAGERS. THE CURRENT TARGET

ALLOCATIONS FOR PLAN ASSETS ARE 55% TO 65% EQUITY SECURITIES AND 20% TO 40% FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER ALLOCATED TO SHORT-TERM SECURITIES. FOR 2017, THE COMPANY PLANS TO APPLY AN

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OF 7.00%, THE SAME RATE THAT WAS APPLIED IN 2016. THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN

REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD TO LONG-TERM RETURNS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PENSION PLAN'S ASSET ALLOCATION TARGETS, THE HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE AND

CURRENT VALUATION OF U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND THE LEVEL OF LONG TERM INTEREST RATE AND INFLATION EXPECTATIONS. THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ALSO

CONTEMPLATES A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS OF LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES IN THE FUTURE.

FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, SEE NOTE 14 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

THE NAIC HAS AN RBC REQUIREMENT FOR MOST PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHICH DETERMINES MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND IS

INTENDED TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THESE NAIC RBC REQUIREMENTS BASED ON LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY

INDIVIDUAL STATES. THESE REQUIREMENTS SUBJECT INSURERS HAVING POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED BY THE RBC CALCULATION TO VARYING DEGREES OF REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF

CAPITAL INADEQUACY. EACH OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE LEVEL AT WHICH ANY RBC REGULATORY ACTION WOULD

OCCUR. REGULATORS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE LOCATED REQUIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVELS OF CAPITAL DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSURANCE POLICIES IN FORCE. EACH OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD CAPITAL SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO CERTAIN CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS FOR GUARANTEES RELATED TO SELLING BUSINESSES TO THIRD PARTIES, CERTAIN INVESTMENTS,

THIRD-PARTY LOANS RELATED TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN INSURANCE POLICY OBLIGATIONS OF FORMER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND VARIOUS OTHER INDEMNIFICATIONS. SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE ARRANGEMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL POSITION, REVENUES AND EXPENSES,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

GROSS

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 DECREASED BY $346 MILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2015. THIS DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE

IMPACTS OF (I) PAYMENTS RELATED TO OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S $524 MILLION PAYMENT RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. LITIGATION AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTION AND (II) NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

IMPACTS OF (III) HIGHER VOLUMES OF INSURED EXPOSURES AND (IV) LOSS COST TRENDS FOR THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR.

ASBESTOS

AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER LINES IN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY TABLE. ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE DISCUSSED SEPARATELY; SEE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION", "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES."

CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED

AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED (IBNR) AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT

INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, PRIMARILY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION METHODS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS

WILL COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY

AND FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING GROSS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, THE COMPANY ALSO CONSIDERS SALVAGE AND

SUBROGATION. ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE ARE INCLUDED IN "REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES" AS AN ASSET ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY.

126

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, CHANGES IN INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE

CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY

PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME

BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL

EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS

ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. THE COMPANY RIGOROUSLY ATTEMPTS TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE

INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT ENVIRONMENT, FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES, AS

CLAIMS ARE SETTLED IN THE FUTURE, MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNT CURRENTLY RECORDEDFAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE.

BECAUSE

ESTABLISHMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES, CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES MAY CHANGE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED.

THERE

ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES, TORNADOES AND OTHER

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND

REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE INTERPRETATION OF POLICY TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF DEMAND

SURGE, INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION, FRAUD, THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A

REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

A

PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S GROSS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (TOTALING $1.91 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016) ARE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

RELATED LITIGATION. WHILE THE ONGOING REVIEW OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES

REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT INSURANCE RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. SEE THE

PRECEDING DISCUSSION OF "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION."

GENERAL DISCUSSION

THE PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING THE LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES BEGINS WITH THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CLAIM DATA. DATA

ON INDIVIDUAL REPORTED CLAIMS, BOTH CURRENT AND HISTORICAL, INCLUDING PAID AMOUNTS AND INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES, ARE GROUPED BY COMMON CHARACTERISTICS

127

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(COMPONENTS)

AND EVALUATED BY ACTUARIES IN THEIR ANALYSES OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES. SUCH DATA IS OCCASIONALLY SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA AS AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE PROCESS OF

ANALYZING RESERVES FOR A COMPONENT IS UNDERTAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS, GENERALLY QUARTERLY, IN LIGHT OF CONTINUALLY UPDATED INFORMATION.

MULTIPLE

ESTIMATION METHODS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES. EACH ESTIMATION METHOD HAS ITS OWN SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES AND ITS OWN ADVANTAGES AND

DISADVANTAGES, WITH NO SINGLE ESTIMATION METHOD BEING BETTER THAN THE OTHERS IN ALL SITUATIONS AND NO ONE SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES BEING MEANINGFUL FOR ALL PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS. THE RELATIVE

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE PARTICULAR ESTIMATION METHODS WHEN APPLIED TO A PARTICULAR GROUP OF CLAIMS CAN ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME. THEREFORE, THE ACTUAL CHOICE OF ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CAN CHANGE

WITH EACH EVALUATION. THE ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CHOSEN ARE THOSE THAT ARE BELIEVED TO PRODUCE THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATION AT THAT PARTICULAR EVALUATION DATE FOR THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED.

IN

MOST CASES, MULTIPLE ESTIMATION METHODS WILL BE VALID FOR THE PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED. THIS WILL RESULT IN A RANGE OF REASONABLE

ESTIMATES FOR ANY PARTICULAR CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY USES SUCH RANGE ANALYSES TO BACK TEST WHETHER PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES FOR RESERVES BY REPORTING SEGMENTS ARE REASONABLE, GIVEN

AVAILABLE INFORMATION. REPORTED VALUES FOUND TO BE CLOSER TO THE ENDPOINTS OF A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER DETAILED REVIEWS. THESE REVIEWS MAY SUBSTANTIATE THE VALIDITY OF

MANAGEMENT'S RECORDED ESTIMATE OR LEAD TO A CHANGE IN THE REPORTED ESTIMATE.

THE

EXACT BOUNDARY POINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN QUANTITATIVE IN NATURE, AS NO CLEAR LINE OF DEMARCATION EXISTS TO DETERMINE WHEN THE SET OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR

AN ESTIMATION METHOD SWITCHES FROM BEING REASONABLE TO UNREASONABLE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ENDPOINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE OR WOULD BE COMPARABLE ACROSS COMPANIES. IN

ADDITION, POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT ESTIMATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES MAKE THE AGGREGATION OF INDIVIDUAL RANGES A HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL AND INEXACT PROCESS.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

INSURANCE POLICIES ARE EITHER WRITTEN ON A "CLAIMS-MADE" OR ON AN "OCCURRENCE" BASIS. CLAIMS-MADE POLICIES GENERALLY COVER, SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL

POLICIES, CLAIMS REPORTED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD. POLICIES THAT ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS REQUIRE THAT THE INSURED DEMONSTRATE THAT A LOSS OCCURRED IN THE POLICY PERIOD, EVEN IF THE INSURED

REPORTS THE LOSS MANY YEARS LATER.

MOST

GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. THESE POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT OVER TIME AS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE IN THE YEARS

FOLLOWING THE POLICY ISSUANCE. THE OCCURRENCE FORM, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, IS ALSO USED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION

GENERAL LIABILITY,

INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. OCCURRENCE-BASED FORMS OF INSURANCE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PROJECTION OF LOSS TRENDS, WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING FUTURE INFLATION, JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND SOCIETAL LITIGATION TRENDS (E.G., SIZE OF JURY AWARDS AND PROPENSITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO PURSUE LITIGATION), AMONG OTHERS.

A

BASIC PREMISE IN MOST ACTUARIAL ANALYSES IS THAT PAST PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED IN THE DATA WILL REPEAT THEMSELVES IN THE FUTURE, ABSENT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS

DISCUSSED BELOW. TO THE EXTENT A MATERIAL CHANGE AFFECTING THE ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY IS KNOWN, SUCH CHANGE IS ESTIMATED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL COMPANY DATA AND, IF

AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXTERNAL DATA. SUCH A MEASUREMENT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR CLAIM PORTFOLIO AND THE KNOWN CHANGE BEING EVALUATED. SIGNIFICANT

STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS.

INFORMED

JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE RESERVING PROCESS. THIS INCLUDES THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. IN

ADDITION TO

128

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACTUARIES,

EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE RESERVING PROCESS ALSO INCLUDE UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER

VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES. IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE, SUCH AS A MERGER, CONSISTENT

APPLICATION OF INFORMED JUDGMENT BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT.

THE

VARIABLES DISCUSSED ABOVE IN THIS GENERAL DISCUSSION HAVE DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON RESERVE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE CLAIM TAIL, THE

REPORTING LAG, THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CLAIM PROCESS FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE.

PRODUCT

LINES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIABLE AS EITHER LONG TAIL OR SHORT TAIL, BASED ON THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING CLAIMS UNDER A POLICY AND THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THOSE CLAIMS. SHORT TAIL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED QUICKLY, RESULTING IN LESS ESTIMATION VARIABILITY. THE LONGER THE TIME TO FINAL CLAIM RESOLUTION, THE GREATER THE EXPOSURE TO

ESTIMATION RISKS AND HENCE THE GREATER THE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

A

MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE CLAIM TAIL IS THE REPORTING LAG. THE REPORTING LAG, WHICH IS THE TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING A CLAIM AND THE REPORTING OF THE CLAIM TO THE INSURER, MAKES

ESTIMATING IBNR INHERENTLY MORE UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, THE GREATER THE REPORTING LAG, THE GREATER THE PROPORTION OF IBNR TO THE TOTAL CLAIM LIABILITY FOR THE PRODUCT LINE. WRITING NEW PRODUCTS WITH

MATERIAL REPORTING LAGS

CAN RESULT IN ADDING SEVERAL YEARS' WORTH OF IBNR CLAIM EXPOSURE BEFORE THE REPORTING LAG EXPOSURE BECOMES CLEARLY OBSERVABLE, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ESTIMATING THE LIABILITIES

FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR SUCH PRODUCTS. THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF CLAIM LIABILITIES WITH LONG REPORTING LAGS ARE ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

FOR

SOME LINES, THE IMPACT OF LARGE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS CAN BE MATERIAL TO THE ANALYSIS. THESE LINES ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS BEING "LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY," WHILE LINES WITHOUT

THIS "LARGE CLAIM" SENSITIVITY ARE REFERRED TO AS "HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY." ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY LINES CAN BE SENSITIVE TO THE IMPACT OF A SMALL NUMBER

OF POTENTIALLY LARGE CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE ROLE OF JUDGMENT IS MUCH GREATER FOR THESE RESERVE ESTIMATES. IN CONTRAST, FOR HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY LINES THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS IS

RELATIVELY MINOR AND THE RANGE OF REASONABLE RESERVE ESTIMATES IS LIKELY NARROWER AND MORE STABLE.

CLAIM

COMPLEXITY CAN ALSO GREATLY AFFECT THE ESTIMATION PROCESS BY IMPACTING THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ESTIMATE, THE POTENTIAL STABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING DATA AND

CLAIM PROCESS, AND THE ABILITY TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA. PRODUCT LINES WITH GREATER CLAIM COMPLEXITY, SUCH AS FOR CERTAIN SURETY AND CONSTRUCTION EXPOSURES, HAVE INHERENTLY GREATER

ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

ACTUARIES

HAVE TO EXERCISE A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT IN THE EVALUATION OF ALL THESE FACTORS IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF RESERVES. THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN THE APPLICATION OF ACTUARIAL

JUDGMENT IS UNAVOIDABLE WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY. DIFFERENT ACTUARIES MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH SUCH UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL

EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF FOCUS. HENCE, THE ESTIMATES SELECTED BY THE VARIOUS ACTUARIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EACH OTHER.

LASTLY,

SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN ALSO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS. EVENTS SUCH AS MERGERS INCREASE THE

INHERENT UNCERTAINTY OF RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, UNTIL STABLE TRENDS RE-ESTABLISH THEMSELVES WITHIN THE NEW ORGANIZATION.

RISK FACTORS

THE MAJOR CAUSES OF MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY ("RISK FACTORS") GENERALLY WILL VARY FOR EACH PRODUCT LINE, AS WELL AS FOR EACH SEPARATELY ANALYZED

COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT LINE. IN A FEW CASES, SUCH RISK FACTORS ARE EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ESTIMATION METHOD, BUT IN MOST CASES, THEY ARE IMPLICIT. FOR EXAMPLE, A

129

TABLE OF CONTENTS

METHOD

MAY EXPLICITLY ASSUME THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS WILL CLOSE EACH YEAR, BUT WILL IMPLICITLY ASSUME THAT THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING CONTRACT LANGUAGE WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED.

ACTUAL RESULTS WILL LIKELY VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS, CAUSING ACTUAL PAID LOSSES, AS CLAIMS ARE SETTLED IN THE FUTURE, TO BE DIFFERENT IN AMOUNT THAN THE RESERVES BEING

ESTIMATED CURRENTLY.

SOME

RISK FACTORS WILL AFFECT MORE THAN ONE PRODUCT LINE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CHANGES IN CLAIM DEPARTMENT PRACTICES, CHANGES IN SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS,

COURT ACTIONS, TIMELINESS OF CLAIM REPORTING, STATE MIX OF CLAIMANTS AND DEGREE OF CLAIMANT FRAUD. THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF A RISK FACTOR WILL ALSO VARY BY COMPONENTS WITHIN A PRODUCT LINE.

INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER RISK FACTORS WITHIN PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS.

THE

EFFECT OF A PARTICULAR RISK FACTOR ON ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES CANNOT BE ISOLATED IN MOST CASES. FOR EXAMPLE, ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL CLAIM SETTLEMENTS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL COURT RULINGS, BUT THE FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TYPICALLY DOES NOT DELINEATE HOW MUCH OF THE SETTLED AMOUNT IS DUE TO THIS AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE

EVALUATION OF DATA IS ALSO SUBJECT TO DISTORTION FROM EXTREME EVENTS OR STRUCTURAL SHIFTS, SOMETIMES IN UNANTICIPATED WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TIMING OF CLAIMS PAYMENTS IN ONE

GEOGRAPHIC REGION MAY BE IMPACTED IF CLAIM ADJUSTERS ARE TEMPORARILY REASSIGNED FROM THAT REGION TO HELP SETTLE CATASTROPHE CLAIMS IN ANOTHER REGION.

WHILE

SOME CHANGES IN THE CLAIM ENVIRONMENT ARE SUDDEN IN NATURE (SUCH AS A NEW COURT RULING AFFECTING THE INTERPRETATION OF ALL CONTRACTS IN THAT JURISDICTION), OTHERS ARE MORE

EVOLUTIONARY. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES CAN OCCUR WHEN MULTIPLE FACTORS AFFECT FINAL CLAIM VALUES, WITH THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING EACH FACTOR BEING RESOLVED SEPARATELY, IN STEPWISE FASHION. THE FINAL

IMPACT IS NOT KNOWN UNTIL ALL STEPS HAVE OCCURRED.

SUDDEN

CHANGES GENERALLY CAUSE A ONE-TIME SHIFT IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME LAG IN RELIABLE QUANTIFICATION OF THEIR IMPACT. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES GENERALLY

CAUSE A SERIES OF SHIFTS IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, AS EACH COMPONENT OF THE EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE BECOMES EVIDENT AND ESTIMABLE.

ACTUARIAL METHODS FOR ANALYZING AND ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES

THE PRINCIPAL ESTIMATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT'S EXISTING ESTIMATES FOR PRIOR ACCIDENT

PERIODS ARE THE PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD, THE CASE INCURRED DEVELOPMENT METHOD, THE BORNHUETTER-FERGUSON (BF) METHOD, AND AVERAGE VALUE ANALYSIS COMBINED WITH THE REPORTED CLAIM DEVELOPMENT

METHOD. THE BF METHOD IS USUALLY UTILIZED FOR MORE RECENT ACCIDENT PERIODS, WITH A TRANSITION TO OTHER METHODS AS THE UNDERLYING CLAIM DATA BECOMES MORE VOLUMINOUS AND THEREFORE MORE CREDIBLE. THESE

ESTIMATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS ARE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS. (SEE NOTE 7 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THESE METHODS).

WHILE

THE COMPANY UTILIZES THESE CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE CLAIMS LIABILITY FOR ITS VARIOUS BUSINESSES, COMPANY ACTUARIES EVALUATING A PARTICULAR COMPONENT FOR A

PRODUCT LINE MAY SELECT FROM THE FULL RANGE OF METHODS DEVELOPED WITHIN THE CASUALTY ACTUARIAL PROFESSION. THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES ARE ALSO CONTINUALLY MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE PROFESSION

FOR ADVANCES IN EXISTING TECHNIQUES OR THE CREATION OF NEW TECHNIQUES THAT MIGHT IMPROVE CURRENT AND FUTURE ESTIMATES.

SOME

COMPONENTS OF A PRODUCT LINE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFREQUENT LARGE CLAIMS OR NOT BE SUBJECT TO CONVENTIONAL METHODS. IN SUCH CASES, THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS WILL ISOLATE

SUCH COMPONENTS FOR REVIEW. THE RESERVES EXCLUDING SUCH LARGE CLAIMS ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED USING THE CONVENTIONAL

130

TABLE OF CONTENTS

METHODS

DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE CLAIMS ARE THEN ANALYZED UTILIZING VARIOUS METHODS, SUCH AS.



ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF LARGE CLAIMS AND THEIR AVERAGE VALUES BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS FROM PRIOR ACCIDENT PERIODS, ADJUSTED FOR THE CURRENT

ENVIRONMENT AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH ACTUAL DATA FOR THE ACCIDENT YEAR ANALYZED TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE.



UTILIZING INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES OF THE LARGE CLAIMS, COMBINED WITH CONTINUAL MONITORING OF THE AGGREGATE ACCURACY OF SUCH CLAIM

ADJUSTER ESTIMATES. (THIS MONITORING MAY LEAD TO SUPPLEMENTAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AGGREGATE OF SUCH CLAIM ESTIMATES.)



UTILIZING HISTORIC LONGER-TERM AVERAGE RATIOS OF LARGE CLAIMS TO SMALL CLAIMS, AND APPLYING SUCH RATIOS TO THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE SMALL CLAIMS

FROM CONVENTIONAL ANALYSIS.



GROUND-UP ANALYSIS OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE (TYPICALLY USED FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL).

THE

RESULTS OF SUCH METHODOLOGIES ARE SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS REASONABILITY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, INCLUDING IMPLIED INCURRED-LOSS-TO-EARNED-PREMIUM RATIOS, NON-ZERO CLAIM SEVERITY TRENDS

AND PAID-TO-INCURRED LOSS RATIOS. AN ACTUAL VERSUS EXPECTED ANALYSIS IS ALSO PERFORMED COMPARING ACTUAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT TO EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT EMBEDDED WITHIN MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATE. ADDITIONAL

ANALYSES MAY BE PERFORMED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE DIAGNOSTICS, INCLUDING THE INVESTIGATION OF OTHER ACTUARIAL METHODS.

THE

METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE FOR PRIOR ACCIDENT PERIODS. FOR THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR, HOWEVER, THE

AVAILABLE CLAIM DATA IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE A RELIABLE INDICATION. AS A RESULT, THE INITIAL ESTIMATE FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR IS GENERALLY BASED ON AN EXPOSURE-BASED METHOD USING EITHER

EXPECTED LOSSES OR A LOSS RATIO PROJECTION METHOD. THE LOSS RATIO METHOD USES THE EARNED PREMIUM FOR THE CURRENT YEAR MULTIPLIED BY A PROJECTED LOSS RATIO. THE PROJECTED LOSS RATIO IS DETERMINED

THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF PRIOR PERIODS' EXPERIENCE, USING LOSS TREND, RATE LEVEL DIFFERENCES, MIX OF BUSINESS CHANGES AND OTHER KNOWN OR OBSERVED FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR RELATIVE

TO PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS. THE EXACT NUMBER OF PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS UTILIZED VARIES BY PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT, BASED ON THE STABILITY AND CONSISTENCY OF THE INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT YEAR ESTIMATES.

MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES

AT LEAST ONCE PER QUARTER, CERTAIN MEMBERS OF COMPANY MANAGEMENT MEET WITH THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES TO REVIEW THE LATEST CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ANALYSES.

BASED ON THESE ANALYSES, MANAGEMENT DETERMINES WHETHER ITS ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CHANGED. IN DOING SO, IT MUST EVALUATE WHETHER THE NEW DATA PROVIDED REPRESENTS CREDIBLE

ACTIONABLE INFORMATION OR AN ANOMALY THAT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, PAYMENTS MAY HAVE DECREASED IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC REGION DUE TO FEWER

CLAIM ADJUSTERS BEING AVAILABLE TO PROCESS CLAIMS. THE RESULTING CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS WOULD BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CHANGE IN PAYMENT PATTERN REPRESENTS A CHANGE IN ULTIMATE

CLAIM LIABILITY.

SUCH

AN ASSESSMENT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT. IT IS FREQUENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CHANGE IN THE DATA IS AN ANOMALY UNTIL SOMETIME AFTER THE EVENT. EVEN IF A CHANGE

IS DETERMINED TO BE PERMANENT, IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE UNTIL SOMETIME LATER. THE OVERALL DETAILED ANALYSES SUPPORTING SUCH AN EFFORT CAN TAKE SEVERAL

MONTHS TO PERFORM AS THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE TRENDS OBSERVED NEED TO BE EVALUATED, WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE GATHERING OR ASSEMBLING OF DATA NOT PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. IT MAY ALSO INCLUDE INTERVIEWS

WITH EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES. AS A RESULT, THERE CAN BE A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE EMERGENCE OF A CHANGE AND A DETERMINATION THAT THE CHANGE SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S

ESTIMATED CLAIM LIABILITIES. THE FINAL ESTIMATE SELECTED BY MANAGEMENT IN A REPORTING PERIOD IS BASED ON THESE VARIOUS DETAILED ANALYSES OF PAST DATA, ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ANY NEW ACTIONABLE

INFORMATION.

DISCUSSION OF PRODUCT LINES

THE FOLLOWING SECTION DETAILS RESERVING CONSIDERATIONS AND COMMON RISK FACTORS BY PRODUCT LINE. THERE ARE MANY ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS THAT MAY

IMPACT ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS. EACH RISK FACTOR PRESENTED WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT ON REQUIRED RESERVES. ALSO, RISK FACTORS CAN HAVE OFFSETTING OR COMPOUNDING EFFECTS ON REQUIRED RESERVES. FOR

EXAMPLE, IN WORKERS' COMPENSATION, THE USE OF EXPENSIVE MEDICAL PROCEDURES THAT RESULT IN MEDICAL COST INFLATION MAY ENABLE WORKERS TO RETURN TO WORK FASTER, THEREBY LOWERING INDEMNITY COSTS. THUS, IN

ALMOST ALL CASES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCRETELY MEASURE THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE RISK FACTOR AND CONSTRUCT A MEANINGFUL SENSITIVITY EXPECTATION.

IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON REASONABLY POSSIBLE RESERVING CHANGES BY PRODUCT LINE, THE HISTORICAL CHANGES IN YEAR-END CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES OVER A ONE-YEAR

PERIOD ARE PROVIDED FOR THE U.S. PRODUCT LINES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR BOTH THE COMPANY AND THE INDUSTRY FOR THE NINE MOST RECENT YEARS, AND IS BASED ON THE MOST RECENT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

DATA FOR THE REPORTED LINE(S) THAT MOST CLOSELY MATCH THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT LINE BEING DISCUSSED. THESE CHANGES WERE CALCULATED, NET OF REINSURANCE, FROM STATUTORY ANNUAL STATEMENT DATA FOUND IN

SCHEDULE P OF THOSE STATEMENTS, AND REPRESENT THE REPORTED RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON THE BEGINNING-OF-THE-YEAR CLAIM LIABILITIES DIVIDED BY THE BEGINNING CLAIM LIABILITIES, ALL ACCIDENT YEARS

COMBINED, EXCLUDING NON-DEFENSE RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE. DATA PRESENTED FOR THE COMPANY INCLUDES HISTORY FOR THE ENTIRE TRAVELERS GROUP (U.S. COMPANIES ONLY), AS REQUIRED BY THE STATUTORY

REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS PROMULGATED BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES FOR SCHEDULE P. COMPARABLE DATA FOR NON-U.S. COMPANIES IS NOT AVAILABLE.

GENERAL LIABILITY

GENERAL LIABILITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL LINE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS FROM A

GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CLAIMS, INCLUDING SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION AND SPECIFIC POLICY

PROVISIONS SUCH AS SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS, AMONG OTHERS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPONENTS UNDERLYING THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. SOME OF THESE HAVE RELATIVELY MODERATE PAYMENT PATTERNS (WITH

MOST OF THE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR CLOSED WITHIN FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS), WHILE OTHERS CAN HAVE EXTREME LAGS IN BOTH REPORTING AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS (E.G., A REPORTING LAG OF A DECADE OR

MORE FOR "CONSTRUCTION DEFECT" CLAIMS).

WHILE

THE MAJORITY OF GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES ARE WRITTEN ON AN "OCCURRENCE" BASIS, CERTAIN GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES (SUCH AS THOSE COVERING MANAGEMENT LIABILITY OR PROFESSIONAL

LIABILITY) ARE TYPICALLY INSURED ON A "CLAIMS-MADE" BASIS.

GENERAL

LIABILITY RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED AS TWO COMPONENTS: PRIMARY AND EXCESS/UMBRELLA, WITH THE PRIMARY COMPONENT GENERALLY ANALYZED SEPARATELY FOR BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY

DAMAGE. BODILY INJURY LIABILITY PAYMENTS REIMBURSE THE CLAIMANT FOR DAMAGES PERTAINING TO PHYSICAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S LEGAL OBLIGATION ARISING FROM NON-INTENTIONAL ACTS SUCH AS

NEGLIGENCE, SUBJECT TO THE INSURANCE POLICY PROVISIONS. IN SOME CASES THE DAMAGES CAN INCLUDE FUTURE WAGE LOSS (WHICH IS A FUNCTION OF FUTURE EARNINGS POWER AND WAGE INFLATION) AND FUTURE MEDICAL

TREATMENT COSTS. PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY PAYMENTS RESULT FROM DAMAGES TO THE CLAIMANT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY ARISING FROM THE POLICYHOLDER'S LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR NON-INTENTIONAL ACTS. IN MOST CASES,

PROPERTY DAMAGE LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF COSTS AS OF THE LOSS DATE, OR SOON THEREAFTER.

IN

ADDITION, SIZABLE OR UNIQUE EXPOSURES ARE REVIEWED SEPARATELY. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE ASBESTOS, ENVIRONMENTAL, OTHER MASS TORTS, CONSTRUCTION DEFECT AND LARGE UNIQUE ACCOUNTS THAT

WOULD OTHERWISE

DISTORT THE ANALYSIS. THESE UNIQUE CATEGORIES OFTEN REQUIRE A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND REQUIRE RESERVE ANALYSES THAT DO NOT RELY ON CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS.

132

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFENSE

COSTS ARE ALSO A PART OF THE INSURED COSTS COVERED BY LIABILITY POLICIES AND CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, SOMETIMES GREATER THAN THE COST OF THE ACTUAL PAID CLAIMS. FOR SOME PRODUCTS THIS

RISK IS MITIGATED BY POLICY LANGUAGE SUCH THAT THE INSURED PORTION OF DEFENSE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN THE POLICY LIMIT AVAILABLE TO PAY THE CLAIM. SUCH "DEFENSE WITHIN THE LIMITS" POLICIES ARE MOST

COMMON FOR "CLAIMS-MADE" PRODUCTS. WHEN DEFENSE COSTS ARE OUTSIDE OF THE POLICY LIMITS, THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE POLICY LIMIT IS AVAILABLE TO PAY CLAIMS AND THE AMOUNTS PAID FOR DEFENSE COSTS HAVE NO

CONTRACTUAL LIMIT.

THIS

LINE IS TYPICALLY THE LARGEST SOURCE OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY IN THE UNITED STATES (EXCLUDING ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS COVERING THE SAME RISK). MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO

THIS RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY INCLUDE THE REPORTING LAG (I.E., THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING COVERAGE AND THE ACTUAL REPORTING OF THE CLAIM), THE NUMBER OF PARTIES

INVOLVED IN THE UNDERLYING TORT ACTION, WHETHER THE "EVENT" TRIGGERING COVERAGE IS CONFINED TO ONLY ONE TIME PERIOD OR IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE TIME PERIODS, THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED (IN THE

INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ACTIONS), WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND INTENDED TO BE COVERED AT THE TIME THE CONTRACTS WERE WRITTEN (I.E., COVERAGE DISPUTE POTENTIAL), AND THE

POTENTIAL FOR MASS CLAIM ACTIONS. CLAIMS WITH LONGER REPORTING LAGS RESULT IN GREATER ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR ALLEGED CLAIMS WITH A LATENCY FEATURE, PARTICULARLY WHERE

COURTS HAVE RULED THAT COVERAGE IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE POLICY YEARS, HENCE INVOLVING MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS (AND THEIR INSURERS AND REINSURERS) AND MULTIPLE POLICIES (THEREBY INCREASING THE POTENTIAL

DOLLARS INVOLVED AND THE UNDERLYING SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY). CLAIMS WITH LONG LATENCIES ALSO INCREASE THE POTENTIAL RECOGNITION LAG (I.E., THE LAG BETWEEN WRITING A TYPE OF POLICY IN A CERTAIN

MARKET AND THE RECOGNITION THAT SUCH POLICIES HAVE POTENTIAL MASS TORT AND/OR LATENT CLAIM EXPOSURE).

THE

AMOUNT OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY ALSO VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY BY COMPONENT FOR THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. THE COMPONENTS IN THIS PRODUCT LINE WITH THE LONGEST LATENCY,

LONGEST REPORTING LAGS, LARGEST POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED AND GREATEST CLAIM SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY ARE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL. COMPONENTS THAT INCLUDE LATENCY, REPORTING LAG AND/OR COMPLEXITY

ISSUES, BUT TO A MATERIALLY LESSER EXTENT THAN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT AND OTHER MASS TORT ACTIONS. MANY COMPONENTS OF GENERAL LIABILITY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO MATERIAL

LATENCY OR CLAIM COMPLEXITY RISKS AND HENCE HAVE MATERIALLY LESS UNCERTAINTY THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED COMPONENTS. IN GENERAL, COMPONENTS WITH SHORTER REPORTING LAGS, FEWER PARTIES INVOLVED IN

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS, ONLY ONE POLICY POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED PER CLAIM, FEWER POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOLLARS, REASONABLY FORESEEABLE (AND STABLE) POTENTIAL HAZARDS/CLAIMS AND NO MASS TORT POTENTIAL

RESULT IN MUCH LESS RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY THAN COMPONENTS WITHOUT THOSE CHARACTERISTICS.

IN

ADDITION TO THE CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS MENTIONED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION, THE COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS REPORT YEAR DEVELOPMENT AND S-CURVE METHODS FOR THE

CONSTRUCTION DEFECT

COMPONENTS OF THIS PRODUCT LINE. THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT REPORT YEAR DEVELOPMENT ANALYSIS IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH PROJECTED CLAIM COUNTS AND AVERAGE VALUES FOR IBNR CLAIM COUNTS. FOR COMPONENTS WITH

GREATER LAGS IN CLAIM REPORTING, SUCH AS EXCESS AND UMBRELLA COMPONENTS OF THIS PRODUCT LINE, THE COMPANY RELIES MORE HEAVILY ON THE BF METHOD THAN ON THE PAID AND CASE INCURRED DEVELOPMENT METHODS.

OF COMMON RISK FACTORS, OR PERCEPTIONS THEREOF, THAT COULD CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED GENERAL LIABILITY RESERVES (BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION

SECTION) INCLUDE.

UNANTICIPATED

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR GENERAL LIABILITY

(EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL), A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.5% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AMOUNTS, OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM

8%

TO 3% (AVERAGING 5%) FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM 5% TO 1% (AVERAGING 3%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S

YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR

CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. GENERAL LIABILITY RESERVES (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL) REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 22% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AMOUNTS, WAS 4% FOR 2016, 3% FOR 2015 AND

5% FOR 2014. THE 2016 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH PRIMARY AND EXCESS COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2015 AND PRIOR. THE 2015 CHANGE

PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EXCESS COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2013. THE 2014 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR EXCESS

COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2008 THROUGH 2012.

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL LINE WITH A SIMPLER AND FASTER CLAIM REPORTING AND ADJUSTMENT PROCESS THAN LIABILITY

COVERAGES, AND LESS UNCERTAINTY IN THE RESERVE SETTING PROCESS (EXCEPT FOR MORE COMPLEX BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS). IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A MODERATE FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY LINE,

EXCEPT FOR CATASTROPHES AND COVERAGE RELATED TO LARGE PROPERTIES. THE CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE CLAIM RESERVES IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE

INSURER. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A LOW ESTIMATION RISK, EXCEPT POSSIBLY FOR CATASTROPHES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS.

134

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMERCIAL

PROPERTY RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN TWO COMPONENTS, ONE FOR CATASTROPHIC OR OTHER LARGE SINGLE EVENTS, AND ANOTHER FOR ALL OTHER EVENTS. EXAMPLES OF COMMON RISK

FACTORS, OR PERCEPTIONS THEREOF, THAT COULD CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED PROPERTY RESERVES (BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION) INCLUDE.

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY RISK FACTORS



PHYSICAL CONCENTRATION OF POLICYHOLDERS



AVAILABILITY AND COST OF LOCAL CONTRACTORS



UNANTICIPATED

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR PROPERTY, A 1%

INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM 25% TO 5% (AVERAGING

16%) FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM 14% TO 5% (AVERAGING 8%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY,

AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS

PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL PROPERTY RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 2% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

SINCE

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE, THE ONE YEAR CHANGE FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CAN BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THAT FOR THE LONGER TAIL PRODUCT LINES. THIS IS DUE

TO THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVE FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY RELATES TO THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE MOST UNCERTAINTY FOR ALL PRODUCT LINES. THIS RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR

UNCERTAINTY IS RELEVANT TO COMMERCIAL PROPERTY BECAUSE OF WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS WHICH, NOTWITHSTANDING 2013 THROUGH 2016 EXPERIENCE, TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, AND

GENERALLY ARE NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. RESERVE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CATASTROPHES MAY TAKE EVEN LONGER TO RESOLVE. THE RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE ARE

ALSO POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO MATERIAL CHANGES DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN MEASURING ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, HURRICANE KATRINA AND STORM

SANDY.

135

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 9% FOR 2016, 21% FOR 2015 AND 18% FOR 2014. THE 2016 CHANGE

PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE RELATED TO NON-CATASTROPHE LOSSES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2014 AND 2015. THE 2015 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE

RELATED TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2011, 2012 AND 2014, AND NON-CATASTROPHE LOSSES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2013 AND 2014. THE 2014 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS

EXPERIENCE FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2010 THROUGH 2013, INCLUDING CATASTROPHE LOSSES FROM STORM SANDY FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2012.

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDES BOTH

SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE, IT GENERALLY TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS, WHILE FOR THE OTHER COVERAGES, GENERALLY FOR THE LIABILITY COVERAGES, IT

TAKES A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS.

THE

RESERVING RISK FOR THIS LINE IS DOMINATED BY THE LIABILITY COVERAGE PORTION OF THIS PRODUCT, EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY IN THE EVENT OF CATASTROPHIC OR LARGE SINGLE LOSSES. THE RESERVING

RISK FOR THIS LINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE AND THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CUSTOMER. COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL IS GENERALLY SOLD TO SMALL- TO

MID-SIZED ACCOUNTS, WHILE THE CUSTOMER PROFILE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY INCLUDES LARGER CUSTOMERS.

SEE

"COMMERCIAL PROPERTY RISK FACTORS" AND "GENERAL LIABILITY RISK FACTORS," DISCUSSED ABOVE, WITH REGARD TO RESERVING RISK FOR COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL.

UNANTICIPATED

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL), A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.2% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AMOUNTS, OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM

19% TO 5% (AVERAGING 2%) FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM 6% TO 1% (AVERAGING 3%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL.

THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE

ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL RESERVES (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES) REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 8% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THIS LINE COMBINES GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY COVERAGES AND IT HAS BEEN IMPACTED IN THE PAST BY MANY OF THE SAME EVENTS AS THOSE TWO LINES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 1% FOR 2016, 1% FOR 2015 AND 3% FOR 2014. THE 2016 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED WORSE THAN EXPECTED LOSS

EXPERIENCE FOR PROPERTY COVERAGES RELATED TO NON-CATASTROPHE LOSSES FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2015. THE 2015 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR PROPERTY COVERAGES RELATED TO

NON-CATASTROPHE LOSSES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2012 AND 2014. THE 2014 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED WORSE THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR LIABILITY COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2010 THROUGH 2013.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE IS A MIX OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGES AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES.

THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE DIFFICULT

TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. IN GENERAL, CLAIM

136

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORTING

LAGS ARE MINOR, CLAIM COMPLEXITY IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE, AND THE LINE IS VIEWED AS HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE

ESTIMATION RISK.

COMMERCIAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN FOUR COMPONENTS: BODILY INJURY LIABILITY; PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY; COLLISION CLAIMS; AND COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS. THESE LAST TWO

COMPONENTS HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT PRESENTED.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES THE CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS MENTIONED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOVE IN ESTIMATING CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE. THIS IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH DETAILED CUSTOM

ANALYSES WHERE NEEDED.

HISTORICALLY, THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM 7% TO 7%

(AVERAGING 0%) FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM 3% TO 6% (AVERAGING 0%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED

EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 1% FOR 2016, 0% FOR 2015 AND 2% FOR 2014. THE 2016 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER

THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2011 AND PRIOR. THE 2014 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2011 AND 2012.

WORKERS' COMPENSATION

WORKERS' COMPENSATION IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL COVERAGE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE CLAIMS FROM A GIVEN

ACCIDENT YEAR. WHILE CERTAIN PAYMENTS SUCH AS INITIAL MEDICAL TREATMENT OR TEMPORARY WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR THE INJURED WORKER ARE MADE QUICKLY, SOME OTHER PAYMENTS ARE MADE OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL

YEARS, SUCH AS AWARDS FOR PERMANENT PARTIAL INJURIES. IN ADDITION, SOME PAYMENTS CAN RUN AS LONG AS THE INJURED WORKER'S LIFE, SUCH AS PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS AND ON-GOING MEDICAL CARE. DESPITE

THE POSSIBILITY OF LONG PAYMENT TAILS, THE REPORTING LAGS ARE GENERALLY SHORT, PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT COMPLEX, AND MOST OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE CONSIDERED HIGH FREQUENCY WITH MODERATE

SEVERITY. THE LARGEST RESERVE RISK GENERALLY COMES FROM THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY CLAIMS PROVIDING LIFETIME COVERAGE FOR MEDICAL EXPENSE ARISING FROM A WORKER'S INJURY, AS SUCH CLAIMS ARE

SUBJECT TO GREATER INFLATION RISK. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A SOMEWHAT GREATER THAN MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

WORKERS'

COMPENSATION RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN THREE COMPONENTS: INDEMNITY LOSSES, MEDICAL LOSSES AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

COMPENSATION, A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.3% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM 2% TO 1% (AVERAGING 1%)

FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM 2 TO 1% (AVERAGING 1%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS

DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. WORKERS' COMPENSATION

RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 2% FOR 2016, 1% FOR 2015 AND 0% FOR 2014. THE 2016 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER

THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2006 AND PRIOR AS WELL AS ACCIDENT YEARS 2009, 2013 AND 2015. THE 2015 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR ACCIDENT

YEARS 2006 AND PRIOR.

FIDELITY AND SURETY

FIDELITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. IT TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE MOST FIDELITY CLAIMS.

THE VOLATILITY OF FIDELITY RESERVES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS OF THE INSURED, THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE INSURED'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT AND ATTACHMENT

POINT OF COVERAGE. THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING RESERVES FOR SMALL, COMMERCIAL INSUREDS IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN THE UNCERTAINTY FOR LARGE COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW

SEVERITY NATURE OF SMALL COMMERCIAL FIDELITY LOSSES PROVIDES FOR STABILITY IN LOSS ESTIMATES, WHEREAS THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY NATURE OF LOSSES FOR LARGE INSUREDS RESULTS IN A WIDER RANGE OF

ULTIMATE LOSS OUTCOMES. ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES THAT RELY ON A STABLE PATTERN OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT ARE GENERALLY NOT APPLICABLE TO LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY CLAIMS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SURETY

HAS CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED SHORT TAIL COVERAGES WITH SHORT REPORTING LAGS, ALTHOUGH LARGE INDIVIDUAL CONSTRUCTION AND COMMERCIAL SURETY CONTRACTS CAN

RESULT IN A LONG SETTLEMENT TAIL, BASED ON THE LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT(S) OR COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION BEING INSURED. (LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS CAN TAKE MANY YEARS TO

COMPLETE.) THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES IN SURETY GENERALLY CORRELATES WITH ECONOMIC CYCLES AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF SURETY LOSS IS THE INABILITY OF AN INSURED TO FULFILL ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THE

COMPANY ACTIVELY SEEKS TO MITIGATE THIS EXPOSURE TO LOSS THROUGH DISCIPLINED RISK SELECTION, ADHERENCE TO UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND ONGOING MONITORING OF CONTRACTOR PROGRESS IN SIGNIFICANT

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THE VOLATILITY OF SURETY LOSSES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS PERFORMED BY THE INSURED, THE TYPE OF BONDED OBLIGATION, THE AMOUNT OF LIMIT EXPOSED TO LOSS AND THE

AMOUNT OF ASSETS AVAILABLE TO THE INSURER TO MITIGATE LOSSES, SUCH AS UNBILLED CONTRACT FUNDS, COLLATERAL, FIRST AND THIRD PARTY INDEMNITY, AND OTHER SECURITY POSITIONS OF AN INSURED'S ASSETS. CERTAIN

CLASSES OF SURETY CLAIMS ARE VERY HIGH SEVERITY, LOW FREQUENCY IN NATURE. THESE CAN INCLUDE LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS INVOLVED WITH ONE OR MULTIPLE LARGE, COMPLEX PROJECTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN

LARGE COMMERCIAL SURETY EXPOSURES. OTHER CLAIM FACTORS AFFECTING RESERVE VARIABILITY OF SURETY INCLUDE LITIGATION RELATED TO AMOUNTS OWED BY AND DUE THE INSURED (E.G., SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION

EFFORTS) AND THE RESULTS OF FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF AN INSURED.

PRODUCT LINE. FIDELITY AND SURETY RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 1% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

IN

GENERAL, DEVELOPMENTS ON SINGLE LARGE CLAIMS (BOTH ADVERSE AND FAVORABLE) ARE A PRIMARY SOURCE OF CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 36% FOR 2016, 30% FOR 2015 AND 36% FOR 2014. THE 2016 CHANGE

PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE FIDELITY AND SURETY PRODUCT LINE FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2009 THROUGH 2015. THE 2015 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS

EXPERIENCE IN THE FIDELITY AND SURETY PRODUCT LINE FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2008 THROUGH 2014, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN OUTSTANDING EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT

COMMENCED IN 2007. THE 2014 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE CONTRACT SURETY PRODUCT LINE FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2012 AND PRIOR.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL DAMAGE

(PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. REPORTING LAGS ARE RELATIVELY

SHORT AND THE CLAIM SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PERSONAL

AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY GENERALLY IS THE LEAST COMPLEX OF THE LIABILITY PRODUCTS. IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY PRODUCT LINE. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR

THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

PERSONAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN FIVE COMPONENTS: BODILY INJURY LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY, NO-FAULT LOSSES, COLLISION CLAIMS AND COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS.

THESE LAST TWO COMPONENTS HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE FACTORS ARE NOT PRESENTED.

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE,

A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM 4% TO 3% (AVERAGING 1%) FOR THE COMPANY, AND

FROM 3% TO 1% (AVERAGING 2%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE RESERVES REPRESENT

APPROXIMATELY 6% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 3% FOR 2016, 4% FOR 2015 AND 1% FOR 2014. THE 2016 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED WORSE THAN EXPECTED LOSS

EXPERIENCE FOR LIABILITY COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2015. THE CHANGE FOR 2015 PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR LIABILITY COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2012 THROUGH 2014.

HOMEOWNERS AND PERSONAL LINES OTHER

HOMEOWNERS IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. MOST PAYMENTS ARE RELATED TO THE PROPERTY PORTION OF THE POLICY, WHERE THE CLAIM

REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE INSURER. CLAIMS ON PROPERTY COVERAGE ARE TYPICALLY REPORTED SOON AFTER THE ACTUAL DAMAGE OCCURS, ALTHOUGH DELAYS OF

SEVERAL MONTHS ARE NOT UNUSUAL. THE RESULTING SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS TYPICALLY FAIRLY SHORT TERM, ALTHOUGH EXCEPTIONS DO EXIST.

THE

LIABILITY PORTION OF THE HOMEOWNERS POLICY GENERATES CLAIMS WHICH TAKE LONGER TO PAY DUE TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF LITIGATION AND NEGOTIATION, BUT WITH GENERALLY SMALL REPORTING LAGS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE (EXCLUDING THE UMBRELLA LINE OF BUSINESS, WHICH FOR STATUTORY REPORTING PURPOSES IS INCLUDED WITH THE

GENERAL LIABILITY LINE OF BUSINESS) OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM 17% TO 3% (AVERAGING 10%) FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM 7% TO

2% (AVERAGING 5%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S

YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR

CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. HOMEOWNERS AND PERSONAL LINES OTHER RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 2% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

THIS

LINE COMBINES BOTH LIABILITY AND PROPERTY COVERAGES; HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVES RELATE TO PROPERTY. WHILE PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE, THE ONE YEAR

CHANGE FOR PROPERTY CAN BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THAT FOR THE LONGER TAIL PRODUCT LINES. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVE FOR PROPERTY RELATES TO THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR,

WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE MOST UNCERTAINTY FOR ALL PRODUCT LINES. THIS RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR UNCERTAINTY IS RELEVANT TO PROPERTY BECAUSE OF WEATHER RELATED EVENTS WHICH, NOTWITHSTANDING 2010 AND 2011

EXPERIENCE, TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, AND GENERALLY ARE NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. RESERVE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CATASTROPHES MAY TAKE

EVEN LONGER TO RESOLVE.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE (EXCLUDING THE UMBRELLA LINE OF BUSINESS) WAS 3% FOR 2016, 16% FOR 2015 AND 16% FOR 2014.

THE 2016 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED MODESTLY WORSE THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR LIABILITY COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2012 THROUGH 2014. THE 2015 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED

LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR LIABILITY COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2011 THROUGH 2014, AND FOR NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES AND NON-WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2014. THE 2014 CHANGE

PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2013 AND FOR CATASTROPHE LOSSES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2011 THROUGH 2013.

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER INCLUDES PRODUCTS WRITTEN BY THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS ALL OTHER PRODUCTS NOT EXPLICITLY

DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF "OTHER" CLAIM RESERVES IS ASSUMED REINSURANCE WRITTEN ON AN EXCESS-OF-LOSS BASIS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE REINSURANCE OF NON-U.S. EXPOSURES, AND IS RUNOFF

BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL

AND OTHER CLAIM LIABILITIES RESULT FROM A MIX OF COVERAGES, CURRENCIES AND JURISDICTIONS/COUNTRIES. THE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC IS THE NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE ANALYSIS TO THE

INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT, AND THE INABILITY TO RELY ON DATA CHARACTERIZATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. STATUTORY REPORTING FRAMEWORK.

DUE

TO CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS MIX FOR THIS LINE OVER TIME, INCLUDING THE 2013 ACQUISITION OF DOMINION, THE RECENTLY INCURRED CLAIM LIABILITIES ARE RELATIVELY SHORTER TAIL (DUE TO BOTH

THE PRODUCTS AND THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED, E.G., CANADA, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM), WHILE THE OLDER LIABILITIES INCLUDE SOME FROM RUNOFF OPERATIONS THAT ARE EXTREMELY

LONG TAIL (E.G., U.S. EXCESS LIABILITIES

REINSURED THROUGH THE LONDON MARKET, AND SEVERAL UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF). THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION, THE

DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (E.G., UNDERWRITING POOL VERSUS DIRECT) AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE INSURANCE SALE TO THE INSURED HAZARD (E.G., INSURED AND INSURER LOCATED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES). IN

PARTICULAR, LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS, SETTLEMENT LAGS AND CLAIM COMPLEXITY, DUE TO THE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER POOL

MEMBERS OR CO-INSURERS THROUGH A BROKER OR LEAD-INSURER FOR CLAIM SETTLEMENT PURPOSES.

INTERNATIONAL

RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED BY COUNTRY AND GENERAL COVERAGE CATEGORY (E.G., GENERAL LIABILITY IN CANADA, COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, ETC.). THE

BUSINESS IS ALSO GENERALLY SPLIT BY DIRECT VERSUS ASSUMED REINSURANCE FOR A GIVEN COVERAGE. WHERE THE UNDERLYING

144

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSURED

HAZARD IS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE UNDERLYING COVERAGES ARE GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER THE HOMEOWNERS, PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, GENERAL LIABILITY,

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND SURETY DISCUSSIONS ABOVE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENCES IN THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT AND DIFFERENCES IN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, STATUTORY COVERAGE DIFFERENCES EXIST

AMONGST VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THERE ARE NO AGGREGATE POLICY LIMITS ON CERTAIN LIABILITY COVERAGES.

OTHER

RESERVES, PRIMARILY ASSUMED REINSURANCE IN RUNOFF, ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED BY PROGRAM/POOL, TREATY TYPE, AND GENERAL COVERAGE CATEGORY (E.G., GENERAL

LIABILITYEXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE). EXCESS EXPOSURE REQUIRES THE INSURED TO "PROVE" NOT ONLY CLAIMS UNDER THE POLICY, BUT ALSO THE PRIOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS REACHING UP TO THE EXCESS

POLICY'S ATTACHMENT POINT.

EXAMPLES

OF COMMON RISK FACTORS, OR PERCEPTIONS THEREOF, THAT COULD CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER RESERVES (BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL

REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS MIX OF RUNOFF BUSINESS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCLUDED COMPARATIVE ANALYSES FOR INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS, THE COMPANY BECOMES INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS

BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO DETERMINE THE COMPANY'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIES TO

MANAGE REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

THE

COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO A REINSURANCE CONTRACT IN CONNECTION WITH A CATASTROPHE BOND ISSUED BY LONG POINT RE III. THIS CONTRACT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS

REINSURANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDANCE FOR ACCOUNTING FOR REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. THE CATASTROPHE BOND IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN "ITEM 1BUSINESSCATASTROPHE

REINSURANCE."

THE

COMPANY REPORTS ITS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ONGOING REVIEW OF

AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES. FROM TIME TO TIME, AS A RESULT OF THE

LONG-TAILED NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING LIABILITIES, COVERAGE COMPLEXITIES AND POTENTIAL FOR DISPUTES, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE COMMUTATION OF REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES AND COMMUTATION ACTIVITY COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES.

RECOVERABLES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS RELATE PRIMARILY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION, FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COMPANIES ISSUING THE ANNUITIES. RECOVERABLES ATTRIBUTABLE TO MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS RELATE

PRIMARILY TO WORKERS' COMPENSATION SERVICE BUSINESS. THESE RECOVERABLES ARE SUPPORTED BY THE PARTICIPATING INSURANCE COMPANIES' OBLIGATION TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE BASED ON EACH COMPANY'S VOLUNTARY

MARKET SHARE OF WRITTEN PREMIUM IN EACH STATE IN WHICH IT IS A POOL PARTICIPANT. IN THE EVENT A MEMBER OF A MANDATORY POOL OR ASSOCIATION DEFAULTS ON ITS SHARE OF THE POOL'S OR ASSOCIATION'S

OBLIGATIONS, THE OTHER MEMBERS' SHARE OF SUCH OBLIGATION INCREASES PROPORTIONALLY.

FOR

A DISCUSSION OF A PENDING REINSURANCE DISPUTE PERTAINING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENT VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENTS

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN THE FAIR VALUE

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON THE INPUTS USED IN VALUATION, GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND REQUIRES THAT OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED IN THE VALUATIONS

WHEN AVAILABLE.

146

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE, UNRELATED, WILLING PARTIES,

I.E., NOT IN A FORCED TRANSACTION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MAY DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED IF THE SECURITY WAS SOLD IN AN IMMEDIATE SALE,

E.G., A FORCED TRANSACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE LESS LIQUID DUE TO THE LACK OF MARKET BASED INPUTS, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL

THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE PRICE AT WHICH AN ACTUAL TRANSACTION WOULD OCCUR.

SEE

NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS.

DUE

TO THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S ANALYSIS AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, ALONG WITH THE JUDGMENT THAT MUST BE APPLIED IN THE ANALYSIS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANY

COULD REACH A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPAIR A SECURITY IF IT HAD ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUER. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ISSUER'S ACTUAL ABILITY TO

MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE COMPANY DETERMINED DURING ITS ANALYSIS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO A DIFFERENT IMPAIRMENT CONCLUSION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND PRICES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS),

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND OTHER RELEVANT MARKET RATE OR PRICE CHANGES. MARKET RISK IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE RELATED UNDERLYING

ASSETS ARE TRADED. THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES AND HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE COMPANY'S MARKET RISK SENSITIVE

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES, ARE PRIMARILY ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING.

THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 WAS $70.49 BILLION AND $70.47 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 86% WAS INVESTED

IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AT

BOTH DATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, APPROXIMATELY 7.1% AND 7.4%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS WERE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO EQUITY

PRICE RISK IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY HAS NO DIRECT COMMODITY RISK AND IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS.

THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISKS TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ARE INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES. THE PORTFOLIO DURATION IS PRIMARILY

MANAGED THROUGH CASH MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND TREASURY FUTURES TRANSACTIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS, SEE NOTES 3 AND 4 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE "INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO" AND "OUTLOOK" SECTIONS OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS."

THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISK FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT IS INTEREST RATE RISK AT THE TIME OF REFINANCING. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND EVALUATES REFINANCING

OPPORTUNITIES AS MATURITY DATES APPROACH. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S DEBT, SEE NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE "LIQUIDITY AND

CAPITAL RESOURCES" SECTION OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS."

THE

COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURE IS CONCENTRATED IN THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS, INSURANCE RESERVES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. CASH

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY TO FUND INSURANCE

RESERVES AND OTHER LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN THE SAME CURRENCY, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR COMPRISED

APPROXIMATELY 4.4% OF THE TOTAL INVESTED ASSETS AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 1.9% AND 2.1% OF TOTAL

INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN OTHER CURRENCIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 WERE NOT MATERIAL.

THERE

WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES WERE MANAGED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ITS PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN FUTURE REPORTING

PERIODS BASED UPON WHAT IS KNOWN OR EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS DEFINED AS THE MEASUREMENT OF POTENTIAL LOSS IN FUTURE EARNINGS, FAIR VALUES OR CASH FLOWS OF MARKET SENSITIVE

INSTRUMENTS RESULTING FROM ONE OR MORE SELECTED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET RATES OR PRICES OVER A SELECTED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE COMPANY'S SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, A

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET RATES IS SELECTED THAT IS EXPECTED TO REFLECT REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN THOSE RATES. "NEAR-TERM" MEANS A PERIOD OF TIME GOING FORWARD UP TO ONE YEAR FROM

THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET RATES ASSUMED IN THIS DISCLOSURE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS DOES

NOT REFLECT THE RESULTS OF ANY ACTIONS THAT WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE COMPANY TO MITIGATE SUCH HYPOTHETICAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE.

INTEREST RATE RISK

IN THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL INCLUDES THE

FOLLOWING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING: FIXED MATURITIES, NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, MORTGAGE LOANS, SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, DEBT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO THE COMPANY'S MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INTEREST RATE RISK (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS). THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USES VARIOUS BASIS POINT CHANGES

IN INTEREST RATES TO MEASURE THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MODEL.

FOR

INVESTED ASSETS WITH PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, ESTIMATES OF PORTFOLIO DURATION AND CONVEXITY ARE USED TO MODEL THE LOSS OF FAIR VALUE THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO RESULT

FROM A PARALLEL INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES. DURATIONS ON INVESTED ASSETS ARE ADJUSTED FOR CALL, PUT AND INTEREST RATE RESET FEATURES. DURATIONS ON TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES ARE ADJUSTED FOR THE FACT THAT

THE YIELDS ON SUCH SECURITIES DO NOT NORMALLY MOVE IN LOCKSTEP WITH CHANGES IN THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE. FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO DURATIONS ARE CALCULATED ON A MARKET VALUE WEIGHTED BASIS, INCLUDING

ACCRUED INTEREST, USING HOLDINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015.

FOR

DEBT, THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY CALCULATING HYPOTHETICAL DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 ENDING PRICES BASED ON YIELDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE,

COMPARING SUCH HYPOTHETICAL ENDING PRICES TO ACTUAL ENDING PRICES, AND MULTIPLYING THE DIFFERENCE BY THE PAR OR SECURITIES OUTSTANDING.

THE

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USED BY THE COMPANY PRODUCES A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.19 BILLION AND $2.00 BILLION BASED ON A

100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.

149

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

LOSS ESTIMATES DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE INTERVENTIONS THAT THE COMPANY MIGHT REASONABLY UNDERTAKE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE OR AVOID LOSSES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM

EMERGING INTEREST RATE TRENDS. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS VALUE ONLY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF AN INTEREST RATE INCREASE ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS FROM FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS. A HYPOTHETICAL 10%

REDUCTION IN VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FOREIGN DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. THE COMPANY'S ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT A HYPOTHETICAL 10%

REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $502 MILLION AND $522 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND

2015, RESPECTIVELY.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE

COMPANY). THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE 2015 AND 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM TO THE

2016 PRESENTATION. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

COMPENSATIONSTOCK COMPENSATION: ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS WHEN THE TERMS OF AN

AWARD PROVIDE THAT A PERFORMANCE TARGET COULD BE ACHIEVED AFTER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD

IN JUNE 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO RESOLVE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE CONCERNING EMPLOYEE

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS THAT CONTAIN PERFORMANCE TARGETS THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED AFTER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT A PERFORMANCE TARGET THAT AFFECTS VESTING AND THAT

CAN BE ACHIEVED AFTER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD BE TREATED AS A PERFORMANCE CONDITION. AS SUCH, THE PERFORMANCE TARGET THAT AFFECTS VESTING SHOULD NOT BE REFLECTED IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE AWARD AT THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION COST SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT BECOMES PROBABLE THAT THE PERFORMANCE TARGET WILL BE ACHIEVED AND SHOULD REPRESENT THE COMPENSATION COST

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PERIODS FOR WHICH SERVICE HAS BEEN RENDERED. IF THE PERFORMANCE TARGET BECOMES PROBABLE OF BEING ACHIEVED BEFORE THE END OF THE SERVICE PERIOD, THE REMAINING UNRECOGNIZED

COMPENSATION COST FOR WHICH REQUISITE SERVICE HAS NOT YET BEEN RENDERED IS RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY OVER THE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION COST RECOGNIZED DURING AND AFTER

THE SERVICE PERIOD SHOULD REFLECT THE NUMBER OF AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO VEST AND SHOULD BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THOSE AWARDS THAT ULTIMATELY VEST. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING

PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2015. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: DISCLOSURE OF UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT AN ENTITY'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE

AS A GOING CONCERN

IN AUGUST 2014, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO ADDRESS THE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE IN DETERMINING WHEN THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT AN ENTITY'S

ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN AND WHEN AN ENTITY MUST DISCLOSE CERTAIN RELEVANT CONDITIONS AND EVENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO EVALUATE WHETHER THERE ARE CONDITIONS OR EVENTS,

CONSIDERED IN THE AGGREGATE, THAT RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE ENTITY'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE THAT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED (OR

AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED). THE NEW GUIDANCE ALLOWS THE ENTITY TO CONSIDER THE MITIGATING EFFECTS OF MANAGEMENT'S PLANS THAT WILL ALLEVIATE THE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AND REQUIRES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES WHEN

SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT IS ALLEVIATED AS A RESULT OF CONSIDERATION OF MANAGEMENT'S PLANS. IF CONDITIONS OR EVENTS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT THAT IS NOT ALLEVIATED, AN ENTITY SHOULD DISCLOSE THAT THERE IS

SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE ENTITY'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE THAT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED (OR AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED), ALONG WITH THE

PRINCIPAL CONDITIONS

OR

EVENTS THAT RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT, MANAGEMENT'S EVALUATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THOSE CONDITIONS OR EVENTS IN RELATION TO THE ENTITY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS AND MANAGEMENT'S PLANS

THAT ARE INTENDED TO MITIGATE THOSE CONDITIONS. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016, AND INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS THEREAFTER. THE ADOPTION OF

THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING: DETERMINING WHETHER THE HOST CONTRACT IN A HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT ISSUED

IN THE FORM OF A SHARE IS MORE AKIN TO DEBT OR TO EQUITY

IN NOVEMBER 2014, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO CLARIFY WHEN THE SEPARATION OF CERTAIN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE FEATURES IN A HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT THAT IS ISSUED IN THE FORM OF A SHARE IS REQUIRED. THAT IS, AN ENTITY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE FEATURE ARE CLEARLY

AND CLOSELY RELATED TO THOSE OF THE HOST CONTRACT. SPECIFICALLY, THE UPDATED GUIDANCE CLARIFIES THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD CONSIDER ALL RELEVANT TERMS AND FEATURES, INCLUDING THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE

FEATURE BEING EVALUATED FOR BIFURCATION, IN EVALUATING THE NATURE OF THE HOST CONTRACT.

FURTHERMORE,

THE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY THAT NO SINGLE TERM OR FEATURE WOULD NECESSARILY DETERMINE THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF THE HOST CONTRACT. RATHER, THE NATURE OF THE HOST

CONTRACT DEPENDS UPON THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF THE ENTIRE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2015. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

CONSOLIDATION: AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS

IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE THAT MAKES TARGETED AMENDMENTS TO THE CURRENT CONSOLIDATION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE UPDATE

IS IN RESPONSE TO ACCOUNTING COMPLEXITY CONCERNS, PARTICULARLY FROM THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY. THE GUIDANCE SIMPLIFIES CONSOLIDATION ACCOUNTING BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF APPROACHES TO

CONSOLIDATION, PROVIDES A SCOPE EXCEPTION TO REGISTERED MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND SIMILAR UNREGISTERED MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND ENDS THE INDEFINITE DEFERRAL GRANTED TO INVESTMENT COMPANIES FROM APPLYING

THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY GUIDANCE. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2015. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

INTERESTIMPUTATION OF INTEREST: SIMPLIFYING THE PRESENTATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS

IN APRIL 2015, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO CLARIFY THE REQUIRED PRESENTATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT

DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS BE PRESENTED IN THE BALANCE SHEET AS A DIRECT REDUCTION FROM THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE RECOGNIZED DEBT LIABILITY, CONSISTENT WITH THE TREATMENT OF DEBT DISCOUNTS. AMORTIZATION OF

DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS IS TO BE REPORTED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT GUIDANCE FOR DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THE UPDATED GUIDANCE. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE

FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2015. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICY AND ITS ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS: SIMPLIFYING THE ACCOUNTING FOR MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE REGARDING BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT REQUIRES AN ACQUIRER TO RECOGNIZE POST-CLOSE

MEASUREMENT ADJUSTMENTS FOR PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENT AMOUNTS ARE DETERMINED RATHER THAN RETROSPECTIVELY. THE ACQUIRER IS ALSO REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE, IN THE SAME PERIOD'S

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS OF CHANGES IN DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, OR OTHER INCOME EFFECTS, IF ANY, AS A RESULT OF THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNT, CALCULATED AS IF THE ACCOUNTING HAD BEEN

COMPLETED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IS TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2015. IN CONNECTION WITH BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED, THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

COMPENSATIONSTOCK COMPENSATION: IMPROVEMENTS TO EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING

IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO SIMPLIFY SEVERAL ASPECTS OF ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS AS FOLLOWS.

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

UNDER

CURRENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, IF THE DEDUCTION FOR A SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARD FOR TAX PURPOSES EXCEEDS, OR IS LESS THAN, THE COMPENSATION COST RECOGNIZED FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, THE RESULTING EXCESS TAX BENEFIT, OR TAX DEFICIENCY, IS REPORTED AS PART OF ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. UNDER THE UPDATED GUIDANCE, THESE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS, OR TAX

DEFICIENCIES, ARE REPORTED AS PART OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN THE INCOME STATEMENT. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE ALSO REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT TO DELAY RECOGNITION OF ANY EXCESS TAX BENEFIT WHEN THERE

ARE NO CURRENT TAXES PAYABLE TO WHICH THE BENEFIT WOULD BE APPLIED. THE TAX-RELATED CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS ARE TO BE INCLUDED WITH OTHER INCOME TAX CASH FLOWS AS AN OPERATING

ACTIVITY RATHER THAN BEING REPORTED SEPARATELY AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY.

FORFEITURES

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE PERMITS AN ENTITY TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO EITHER ACCOUNT FOR FORFEITURES WHEN THEY OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO APPLY THE CURRENT METHOD

OF ACCRUING THE COMPENSATION COST BASED ON THE NUMBER OF AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO VEST.

MINIMUM STATUTORY TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE CHANGES THE THRESHOLD AMOUNT AN ENTITY CAN WITHHOLD FOR TAXES WHEN SETTLING AN EQUITY AWARD AND STILL QUALIFY FOR EQUITY CLASSIFICATION. A COMPANY

CAN WITHHOLD UP TO THE MAXIMUM STATUTORY TAX RATES IN THE EMPLOYEES' APPLICABLE JURISDICTION RATHER THAN WITHHOLDING UP TO THE EMPLOYERS' MINIMUM STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENT. THE UPDATE ALSO

CLARIFIES THAT ALL CASH PAYMENTS MADE TO TAXING AUTHORITIES ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES FOR WITHHELD SHARES ARE TO BE PRESENTED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES ON THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

TRANSITION

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED IN ANY INTERIM PERIOD; IF EARLY ADOPTION

IS ELECTED, THE ENTITY MUST ADOPT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD AND REFLECT ANY ADJUSTMENTS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR.

THE

COMPANY ADOPTED THE UPDATED GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016. WITH RESPECT TO THE FORFEITURE ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO RETAIN ITS POLICY OF ACCRUING

THE COMPENSATION COST BASED ON THE NUMBER OF AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO VEST. THE ADOPTION DID NOT RESULT IN ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENTS OR RESTATEMENT AND DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OTHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO CLARIFY THE PRINCIPLES FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE. WHILE INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE NOT WITHIN THE

SCOPE OF THIS UPDATED GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY'S FEE INCOME RELATED TO PROVIDING CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES AS WELL AS CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES WILL BE SUBJECT TO THIS UPDATED

GUIDANCE.

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE MET, IN ORDER TO REFLECT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT

THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THE ENTITY IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. THE FOLLOWING STEPS ARE APPLIED IN THE UPDATED GUIDANCE: (1) IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT(S) WITH A

CUSTOMER; (2) IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT; (3) DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE; (4) ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE

CONTRACT; AND (5) RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN, OR AS, THE ENTITY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2018. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSOVERALL: RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

IN JANUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO ADDRESS THE RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES EQUITY INVESTMENTS, EXCEPT THOSE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, THAT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME. EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES MAY BE REMEASURED AT FAIR VALUE EITHER UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN OBSERVABLE

PRICE CHANGE OR UPON IDENTIFICATION OF AN

IMPAIRMENT. A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT FOR IMPAIRMENT IS REQUIRED FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS WITHOUT READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE ALSO ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE THE

METHOD AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING

MARCH 31, 2018 AND WILL REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT AT ADOPTION. BASED ON THE EQUITY INVESTMENTS CURRENTLY HELD BY THE COMPANY, THERE WOULD NOT BE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY IF THE NEW GUIDANCE WERE ABLE TO BE

161

ADOPTED

IN THE CURRENT ACCOUNTING PERIOD. THE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF THE UPDATED GUIDANCE WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY AND THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AT THAT TIME.

LEASES

IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO REQUIRE LESSEES TO RECOGNIZE A RIGHT-TO-USE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY FOR LEASES WITH

TERMS OF MORE THAN 12 MONTHS. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE RETAINS THE TWO CLASSIFICATIONS OF A LEASE AS EITHER AN OPERATING OR FINANCE LEASE (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS A CAPITAL LEASE). BOTH LEASE

CLASSIFICATIONS REQUIRE THE LESSEE TO RECORD THE RIGHT-TO-USE ASSET AND THE LEASE LIABILITY BASED UPON THE PRESENT VALUE OF CASH FLOWS. FINANCE LEASES WILL REFLECT THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT BY

RECOGNIZING INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE LEASE LIABILITY SEPARATELY FROM THE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF THE RIGHT-TO-USE ASSET. OPERATING LEASES WILL RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE (WITH NO SEPARATE RECOGNITION OF

INTEREST EXPENSE) ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. THE ACCOUNTING BY LESSORS IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED BY THE UPDATED GUIDANCE. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES EXPANDED

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND WILL REQUIRE THAT THE EARLIEST COMPARATIVE PERIOD PRESENTED INCLUDE THE MEASUREMENT

AND RECOGNITION OF EXISTING LEASES WITH AN ADJUSTMENT TO EQUITY AS IF THE UPDATED GUIDANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN APPLIED. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

INVESTMENTSEQUITY METHOD AND JOINT VENTURES: SIMPLIFYING THE TRANSITION TO THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE THAT ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT TO RETROACTIVELY APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING WHEN AN

INVESTMENT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR USING ANOTHER METHOD OF ACCOUNTING BECOMES QUALIFIED TO APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF OWNERSHIP INTEREST OR DEGREE OF

INFLUENCE. IF THE INVESTMENT WAS PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITY, ANY RELATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AT THE DATE THE INVESTMENT

BECOMES QUALIFIED FOR THE EQUITY METHOD IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH EARNINGS. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016, AND IS TO BE APPLIED

PROSPECTIVELY. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING: CONTINGENT PUT AND CALL OPTIONS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS

IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE CLARIFYING THAT WHEN A CALL (PUT) OPTION IN A DEBT INSTRUMENT IS CONTINGENTLY EXERCISABLE, THE

EVENT THAT TRIGGERS THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE THE OPTION IS CONSIDERED TO BE CLEARLY AND CLOSELY RELATED TO THE DEBT INSTRUMENT (I.E., THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF THE OPTION ARE

RELATED TO INTEREST RATES OR CREDIT RISKS) AND THE ENTITY DOES NOT HAVE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE OPTION SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIODS

BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

162

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

GUIDANCE

IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSCREDIT LOSSES: MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE FOR THE ACCOUNTING FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE APPLIES A

NEW CREDIT LOSS MODEL (CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES OR CECL) FOR DETERMINING CREDIT-RELATED IMPAIRMENTS FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST (E.G. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES)

AND REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO ESTIMATE THE CREDIT LOSSES EXPECTED OVER THE LIFE OF AN EXPOSURE OR POOL OF EXPOSURES. THE ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES SHOULD CONSIDER HISTORICAL INFORMATION, CURRENT

INFORMATION, AS WELL AS REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE FORECASTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF PREPAYMENTS. THE EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES, AND SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS TO SUCH LOSSES, WILL BE RECORDED THROUGH AN

ALLOWANCE ACCOUNT THAT IS DEDUCTED FROM THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE FINANCIAL ASSET, WITH THE NET CARRYING VALUE OF THE FINANCIAL ASSET PRESENTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT THE AMOUNT

EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED.

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE ALSO AMENDS THE CURRENT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES BY REQUIRING THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENTS RELATING TO CREDIT

LOSSES THROUGH AN ALLOWANCE ACCOUNT AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT LOSS TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SECURITY'S AMORTIZED COST BASIS AND ITS FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THE LENGTH OF TIME A SECURITY HAS

BEEN IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION WILL NO LONGER IMPACT THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS.

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2018. BASED ON THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CURRENTLY HELD BY THE COMPANY, THERE WOULD NOT BE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY IF THE NEW GUIDANCE

WERE ABLE TO BE ADOPTED IN THE CURRENT ACCOUNTING PERIOD. THE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF THE UPDATED GUIDANCE WILL BE

DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY AND THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AT THAT TIME.

INTANGIBLESGOODWILL AND OTHER

IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE THAT ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT TO CALCULATE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL

(I.E., STEP 2 OF THE CURRENT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST) TO MEASURE A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. INSTEAD, ENTITIES WILL RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE BY COMPARING A REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE

WITH ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND RECOGNIZING AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (I.E., STEP 1 OF CURRENT GUIDANCE). THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF

GOODWILL IS CURRENTLY DETERMINED IN STEP 2 BY DEDUCTING THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE REPORTING UNIT (DETERMINED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION) FROM THE REPORTING

UNIT'S FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED IN STEP 1 (INCLUDING ANY CORPORATE-LEVEL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND

FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IN STEP 1). THE UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO PERFORM ITS ANNUAL, OR INTERIM, IMPAIRMENT TEST BY EITHER: (1) AN INITIAL QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT

OF FACTORS (SUCH AS CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT, KEY PERSONNEL, STRATEGY, KEY TECHNOLOGY OR CUSTOMERS) THAT MAY IMPACT A REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE AND LEAD TO THE DETERMINATION THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT THAT THE REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL (CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT GUIDANCE), OR (2) APPLYING STEP 1.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INVESTMENTS

FIXED MATURITY AND EQUITY SECURITIES

FIXED MATURITIES INCLUDE BONDS, NOTES AND REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS. FIXED MATURITIES, INCLUDING INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO SECURITIES LENDING

AGREEMENTS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF INCOME TAXES, CHARGED OR CREDITED DIRECTLY TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME. EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE PUBLIC COMMON AND NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT

FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF INCOME TAXES, CHARGED OR CREDITED DIRECTLY TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY'S REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE WAREHOUSES, OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL LAND AND PROPERTIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY OWNED.

REAL ESTATE IS RECORDED ON THE PURCHASE DATE AT THE PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH GENERALLY REPRESENTS FAIR VALUE, AND IS SUPPORTED BY INTERNAL ANALYSIS OR EXTERNAL APPRAISALS THAT USE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

ANALYSES AND OTHER ACCEPTABLE VALUATION TECHNIQUES. REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES IS SUBSEQUENTLY CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION.

BUILDINGS

ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SHORTER OF THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OF THE BUILDING OR 39 YEARS. REAL ESTATE HELD FOR SALE IS CARRIED AT LOWER OF COST

OR FAIR VALUE, LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO SELL.

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES HAVE AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR AND ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS

THE

COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. THE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE HEDGE FUNDS

GENERALLY REPORT INVESTMENTS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED BY THE INVESTEE ARE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY ON A LAG BASIS, WITH THE LAG PERIOD GENERALLY DEPENDENT

UPON THE

TYPE OF UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. THE PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION QUARTERLY WHICH IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WITHIN THREE

TO SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE HEDGE FUNDS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION MONTHLY, WHICH IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS WITHIN ONE MONTH FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE

REPORTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REQUESTS FINANCIAL INFORMATION FROM THE PARTNERSHIPS PRIOR TO THE RECEIPT

OTHER

ALSO

INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE NON-PUBLIC COMMON EQUITIES, PREFERRED EQUITIES AND DERIVATIVES. NON-PUBLIC COMMON EQUITIES AND PREFERRED EQUITIES ARE REPORTED AT

FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, NET OF INCOME TAXES, CHARGED OR CREDITED DIRECTLY TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH

THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE DERIVATIVES USED BY THE COMPANY, SEE

NOTE 3.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

INVESTMENT INCOME FROM FIXED MATURITIES IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONSTANT EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD WHICH INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT FOR ESTIMATED

PRINCIPAL PRE-PAYMENTS, IF ANY. THE EFFECTIVE YIELD USED TO DETERMINE AMORTIZATION FOR FIXED MATURITIES SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK (E.G., ASSET-BACKED, LOAN-BACKED AND STRUCTURED SECURITIES) IS

RECALCULATED AND ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY BASED UPON ACTUAL HISTORICAL AND/OR PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM A WIDELY-ACCEPTED SECURITIES DATA PROVIDER. THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE YIELD

FOR HIGHLY RATED PREPAYABLE FIXED MATURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE YIELD FOR NON-HIGHLY RATED PREPAYABLE FIXED MATURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE

PROSPECTIVE METHOD. DIVIDENDS ON EQUITY SECURITIES (INCLUDING THOSE WITH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS) ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME WHEN DECLARED. RENTAL INCOME ON REAL ESTATE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. SEE THE SECTION TITLED: REAL ESTATE IN NOTE 3 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS AND

JOINT VENTURES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING, WHEREBY THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF THE INVESTEE'S EARNINGS OR LOSSES IN THE FUND IS REPORTED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME.

ACCRUAL

OF INCOME IS SUSPENDED ON NON-SECURITIZED FIXED MATURITIES THAT ARE IN DEFAULT, OR ON WHICH IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AS SCHEDULED. INTEREST INCOME ON

INVESTMENTS IN DEFAULT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED. INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET THAT WERE NOT INCOME-PRODUCING FOR THE PRECEDING 12 MONTHS WERE NOT

MATERIAL.

FOR

FIXED MATURITIES WHERE THE COMPANY RECORDS AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, A DETERMINATION IS MADE AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND WHETHER THE COMPANY EXPECTS A RECOVERY IN

THE VALUE. FOR FIXED MATURITIES WHERE THE COMPANY EXPECTS A RECOVERY IN VALUE, NOT NECESSARILY TO PAR, THE CONSTANT EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD IS UTILIZED, AND THE INVESTMENT IS AMORTIZED TO THE EXPECTED

RECOVERY AMOUNT.

INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF PRE-TAX REVENUES BASED UPON SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE INVESTMENTS

SOLD ON THE TRADE DATE. INCLUDED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON INVESTED ASSETS OTHER THAN THOSE INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AS DESCRIBED IN THE "INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS" SECTION THAT FOLLOWS.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS A PERIODIC REVIEW TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE INVESTED ASSETS HAVING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. SOME OF THE FACTORS

CONSIDERED IN IDENTIFYING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE: (1) FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, WHETHER THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SELL THE INVESTMENT OR WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE INVESTMENT PRIOR TO AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (2) FOR NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS,

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (3) THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES (I.E., WHETHER THERE IS A CREDIT LOSS) OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; (4) THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS

BEEN LESS THAN AMORTIZED COST FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND (5) THE FINANCIAL CONDITION, NEAR-TERM AND LONG-TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING THE

RELEVANT INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND TRENDS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS AND OFFERING PRICES.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES

FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL OR FOR WHICH IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE

REQUIRED TO SELL BEFORE AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE, THE COMPANY SEPARATES THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT OF THE IMPAIRMENT FROM THE AMOUNT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS AND REPORTS THE CREDIT LOSS

COMPONENT IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS IS REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FOR

EQUITY SECURITIES (INCLUDING PUBLIC COMMON AND NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK) AND FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SELL OR FOR WHICH IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL BEFORE AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE, THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS INCLUDED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

UPON

RECOGNIZING AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THE NEW COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT IS THE PREVIOUS AMORTIZED COST BASIS LESS THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RECOGNIZED IN NET

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE NEW COST BASIS IS NOT ADJUSTED FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE; HOWEVER, FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW COST BASIS

AND THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IS ACCRETED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO NET INVESTMENT INCOME OVER THE REMAINING EXPECTED LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT.

DETERMINATION OF CREDIT LOSSFIXED MATURITIES

THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS BY UTILIZING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELING TO DETERMINE THE

PRESENT VALUE OF THE SECURITY AND COMPARING THE PRESENT VALUE WITH THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE SECURITY. IF THE AMORTIZED COST IS GREATER THAN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, THE

DIFFERENCE IS CONSIDERED A CREDIT LOSS AND RECOGNIZED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

FOR

NON-STRUCTURED FIXED MATURITIES (U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL

SUBDIVISIONS, DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND CERTAIN CORPORATE DEBT), THE ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IS DETERMINED BY PROJECTING A RECOVERY VALUE AND A RECOVERY TIME FRAME AND

ASSESSING WHETHER FURTHER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WILL BE RECEIVED. THE DETERMINATION OF RECOVERY VALUE INCORPORATES AN

ISSUER

VALUATION ASSUMPTION UTILIZING ONE OR A COMBINATION OF VALUATION METHODS AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE UNDISCOUNTED RECOVERY VALUE BY ALLOCATING THE ESTIMATED

VALUE OF THE ISSUER TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF THE PRIORITY OF CLAIMS. THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE SECURITY AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION

(OR THE MOST RECENT IMPLIED RATE USED TO ACCRETE THE SECURITY IF THE IMPLIED RATE HAS CHANGED AS A RESULT OF A PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT) AND AN ESTIMATED RECOVERY TIME FRAME. GENERALLY, THAT TIME FRAME FOR

SECURITIES FOR WHICH THE ISSUER IS IN BANKRUPTCY IS 12 MONTHS. FOR SECURITIES FOR WHICH THE ISSUER IS FINANCIALLY TROUBLED BUT NOT IN BANKRUPTCY, THAT TIME FRAME IS GENERALLY 24 MONTHS.

INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION ARE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS; HOWEVER, FOR SECURITIES FOR WHICH THE ISSUER IS CLASSIFIED AS BANKRUPT OR IN DEFAULT, THE PRESENT VALUE

CALCULATION ASSUMES NO INTEREST PAYMENTS AND A SINGLE RECOVERY AMOUNT.

IN

ESTIMATING THE RECOVERY VALUE, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO A MYRIAD OF FACTORS RELATED TO THE ISSUER INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

REVENUE, MARGIN AND EARNINGS PROJECTIONS, THE LIKELY MARKET OR LIQUIDATION VALUES OF ASSETS, POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL DEBT TO BE INCURRED PRE- OR POST-BANKRUPTCY/RESTRUCTURING, THE ABILITY TO SHIFT

EXISTING OR NEW DEBT TO DIFFERENT PRIORITY LAYERS, THE AMOUNT OF RESTRUCTURING/BANKRUPTCY EXPENSES, THE SIZE AND PRIORITY OF UNFUNDED PENSION OBLIGATIONS, LITIGATION OR OTHER CONTINGENT CLAIMS, THE

TREATMENT OF INTERCOMPANY CLAIMS AND THE LIKELY OUTCOME WITH RESPECT TO INTER-CREDITOR CONFLICTS.

FOR

STRUCTURED FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES (PRIMARILY RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE

SECURITY BY PROJECTING FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSETS UNDERLYING THE SECURITIZATION, ALLOCATING THE FLOWS TO THE VARIOUS TRANCHES BASED ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITIZATION AND DETERMINING THE

PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS USING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE SECURITY AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION (OR THE MOST RECENT IMPLIED RATE USED TO ACCRETE THE SECURITY IF THE IMPLIED RATE HAS CHANGED AS A

RESULT OF A PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT OR CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS). THE COMPANY INCORPORATES LEVELS OF DELINQUENCIES, DEFAULTS AND SEVERITIES AS WELL AS CREDIT ATTRIBUTES OF THE REMAINING ASSETS IN

THE SECURITIZATION, ALONG WITH OTHER ECONOMIC DATA, TO ARRIVE AT ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE PARAMETERS APPLIED TO THE ASSETS UNDERLYING THE SECURITIZATION. IN ORDER TO PROJECT CASH FLOWS, THE FOLLOWING

ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPLIED TO THE ASSETS UNDERLYING THE SECURITIZATION: (1) VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT RATES, (2) DEFAULT RATES AND (3) LOSS SEVERITY. THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THE

PRIME, ALT-A AND FIRST-LIEN SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

ON

AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, THE COMPANY OBTAINS INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE CARRYING VALUE OF ALL

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT

CONSIDERS THE VALUATION FROM THE INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL, WHEN APPLICABLE, AND INCORPORATES AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED

TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE

OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR IMPAIRMENT NO LESS

FREQUENTLY THAN QUARTERLY AND MONITORS THE PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MANAGERS/GENERAL PARTNERS. IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF AN IMPAIRMENT OF A PARTNERSHIP'S

INVESTMENTS AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE PARTNERSHIP'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IT WILL RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT BY RECORDING A REDUCTION IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH

A CORRESPONDING CHARGE TO NET INVESTMENT INCOME.

CHANGES IN INTENT TO SELL TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED ASSETS

THE

COMPANY MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, SELL INVESTED ASSETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE THAT IT DID NOT INTEND TO SELL AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. CONVERSELY, THE

COMPANY MAY NOT SELL INVESTED ASSETS THAT IT ASSERTED THAT IT INTENDED TO SELL AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. SUCH CHANGES IN INTENT ARE DUE TO EVENTS OCCURRING SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE

TYPES OF EVENTS THAT MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN INTENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO THE INVESTED ASSET (E.G., A

DOWNGRADE OR UPGRADE FROM A RATING AGENCY), SIGNIFICANT UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN LIQUIDITY NEEDS, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

SECURITIES LENDING

THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES NET INVESTMENT INCOME BY LENDING CERTAIN OF ITS INVESTMENTS TO

OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. BORROWERS OF THESE SECURITIES PROVIDE COLLATERAL EQUAL TO AT LEAST 102% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. THIS

COLLATERAL IS HELD BY A THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN, AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE COLLATERAL ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THE INSTITUTION BORROWING THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES IS IN DEFAULT UNDER THE

LENDING AGREEMENT. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RECEIPT OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN OR THE OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE COLLATERAL. THE LOANED SECURITIES REMAIN A

RECORDED ASSET OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ACCEPTS ONLY CASH AS COLLATERAL FOR SECURITIES ON LOAN AND RESTRICTS THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT CASH IS INVESTED.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ONGOING REVIEW OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION

PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. AMOUNTS DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE, INCLUDING AMOUNTS DUE FROM KNOWN INSOLVENT

REINSURERS, ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. ANY SUBSEQUENT COLLECTIONS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF ARE REPORTED AS PART OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE

FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

INCREMENTAL DIRECT COSTS OF ACQUIRED, NEW AND RENEWAL INSURANCE CONTRACTS, CONSISTING OF COMMISSIONS (OTHER THAN CONTINGENT COMMISSIONS) AND

PREMIUM-RELATED TAXES, ARE CAPITALIZED AND CHARGED TO EXPENSE PRO RATA OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS IN WHICH THE RELATED PREMIUMS ARE EARNED. DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS ARE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE IF THEY

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE INCOME AND, IF NOT, ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. FUTURE INVESTMENT INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RELATED PREMIUMS IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MEASURING THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THIS ASSET. ALL OTHER ACQUISITION EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED.

CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

UNDER CERTAIN WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT FOR THE FULL

AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE POLICYHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. THESE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN

CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES AND CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS A REVIEW, ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, OF GOODWILL HELD BY THE REPORTING UNITS WHICH ARE THE COMPANY'S THREE OPERATING AND

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE; BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE; AND PERSONAL INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS AND COMPARES IT TO

THEIR CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS WERE TO EXCEED THEIR FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE CALCULATED AND GOODWILL ADJUSTED

ACCORDINGLY.

THE

COMPANY USES A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL IS AN INCOME APPROACH TO VALUATION THAT IS BASED ON A

DETAILED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR DERIVING A CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS AND IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTING UNITS' CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE DISCOUNT

RATE ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE

COMPANY'S WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, AND ARE COMPARED AGAINST AVAILABLE MARKET DATA FOR REASONABLENESS.

OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY THE COMPANY ARE ALSO REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASSET AS INDEFINITE-LIVED IS

REASSESSED AND AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE A FINITE USEFUL LIFE ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A FINITE USEFUL LIFE IS REGULARLY

REVIEWED FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT IN VALUE. IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE FROM ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND IS MEASURED AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

AS

A RESULT OF THE REVIEWS PERFORMED FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDED THE

RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FOR THOSE YEARS AND THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY ALSO DETERMINED DURING ITS REVIEWS FOR EACH YEAR THAT ITS OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE NOT IMPAIRED.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT ESTIMATES FOR THE ULTIMATE COST OF UNPAID REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND

RELATED EXPENSES. THE RESERVES ARE ADJUSTED REGULARLY BASED UPON EXPERIENCE. INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ARE RESERVES FOR LONG-TERM

DISABILITY AND ANNUITY CLAIM PAYMENTS, PRIMARILY ARISING FROM WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE POLICIES, THAT ARE DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED

FUTURE PAYMENTS.

THE

COMPANY PERFORMS A CONTINUING REVIEW OF ITS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, INCLUDING ITS RESERVING TECHNIQUES AND THE IMPACT OF REINSURANCE. THE RESERVES ARE ALSO

REVIEWED REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. SINCE THE RESERVES ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN SUCH RESERVES. THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN

SUCH ESTIMATED

RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. SUCH CHANGES IN ESTIMATES COULD OCCUR IN A FUTURE PERIOD AND MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN SUCH PERIOD.

OTHER LIABILITIES

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IS THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITY FOR GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER

INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. THE LIABILITY FOR EXPECTED STATE GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER PREMIUM-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE COMPANY WRITES OR BECOMES OBLIGATED TO WRITE OR RENEW THE

PREMIUMS ON WHICH THE ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE BASED. THE LIABILITY FOR LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE RELATED LOSSES ARE INCURRED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE COMPANY

HAD A LIABILITY OF $242 MILLION AND $241 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS AND RELATED RECOVERABLES OF $16 MILLION AND

$18 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE LIABILITY FOR SUCH ASSESSMENTS AND THE RELATED RECOVERABLES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED FOR THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. THE LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PAID

OVER A PERIOD RANGING FROM ONE YEAR TO THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF CERTAIN WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMANTS AND THE RECOVERIES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME.

ALSO

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IS AN ACCRUAL FOR POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS. CERTAIN INSURANCE CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY WORKERS' COMPENSATION, ARE PARTICIPATING WHEREBY DIVIDENDS ARE PAID TO

POLICYHOLDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACT PROVISIONS. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR PARTICIPATING DIVIDEND POLICIES WERE APPROXIMATELY 1%, 2% AND 1% OF TOTAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS ARE ACCRUED AGAINST EARNINGS USING BEST AVAILABLE ESTIMATES OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID. THE LIABILITY ACCRUED FOR POLICYHOLDER

DIVIDENDS TOTALED $62 MILLION AND $57 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.

2. SEGMENT INFORMATION

THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED TO PREPARE THE SEGMENT REPORTING DATA FOR THE COMPANY'S THREE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1.

EXCEPT

AS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR CERTAIN LEGAL ENTITIES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES ITS INVESTED ASSETS AND THE RELATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME TO ITS REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. PRE-TAX NET

INVESTMENT INCOME IS ALLOCATED BASED UPON AN INVESTABLE FUNDS CONCEPT, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT LIABILITIES (NET OF NON-INVESTED ASSETS) AND APPROPRIATE CAPITAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EACH SEGMENT. FOR

INVESTABLE FUNDS, A BENCHMARK INVESTMENT YIELD IS DEVELOPED THAT REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE LOSS RESERVES' FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME THE LOSSES WERE

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

ENTITIES WHICH DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUITY AT RISK TO ALLOW THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT OR IN

INTEREST HOLDER THAT IS DETERMINED TO HAVE THE CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST (PRIMARY BENEFICIARY) AS A RESULT OF HAVING BOTH THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACT THE VIE'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. THE COMPANY

DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF AN ENTITY SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATION BASED ON A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE VIE'S CAPITAL STRUCTURE, CONTRACTUAL TERMS, NATURE OF THE VIE'S

OPERATIONS AND PURPOSE AND THE COMPANY'S RELATIVE EXPOSURE TO THE RELATED RISKS OF THE VIE ON THE DATE IT BECOMES INITIALLY INVOLVED IN THE VIE. THE COMPANY REASSESSES ITS VIE DETERMINATION WITH

RESPECT TO AN ENTITY ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS WHERE THE COMPANY IS NOT RELATED TO THE GENERAL PARTNER. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD AND REPORTED IN

THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER INVESTMENTS UNLESS THE COMPANY IS DEEMED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THESE EQUITY INTERESTS GENERALLY CANNOT BE REDEEMED. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THESE

INVESTMENTS ARE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF LIQUIDATION OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS OF THE FUNDS AND/OR AS INCOME DISTRIBUTION. THE COMPANY'S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS WITH RESPECT TO

THESE INVESTMENTS IS LIMITED TO THE INVESTMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND ANY UNFUNDED COMMITMENT. NEITHER THE CARRYING AMOUNTS NOR THE UNFUNDED

COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THESE VIES ARE MATERIAL.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO U.S. TREASURY NOTE FUTURES CONTRACTS TO MODIFY THE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF SPECIFIC ASSETS WITHIN THE

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS REQUIRE A DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET AND SETTLEMENT WITH THE BROKER. AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE COMPANY HAD $400 MILLION

NOTIONAL VALUE OF OPEN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014 WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

THE

COMPANY ALSO SELLS A SMALL AMOUNT OF U.S. EQUITY INDEX PUT OPTION CONTRACTS THAT ARE SETTLED FOR CASH UPON THEIR EXPIRATION OR WHEN THEY ARE ROLLED OVER. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT

LOSSES RELATED TO THESE DERIVATIVES IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014 WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE FRAMEWORK IS BASED

ON THE INPUTS USED IN VALUATION, GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND REQUIRES THAT OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED IN THE VALUATIONS WHEN AVAILABLE. THE DISCLOSURE OF FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES IN THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON WHETHER THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION

ARE OBSERVABLE. IN DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY IN WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS DISCLOSED, THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT MARKET ASSUMPTIONS. THE LEVEL IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WITHIN WHICH THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS REPORTED IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL

INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE THREE LEVELS OF THE HIERARCHY ARE AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1



UNADJUSTED QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES

IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS.



LEVEL 2



QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS;

QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS; OR VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE (E.G., INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES,

PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULT RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, ETC.) OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.



LEVEL 3



VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE NOT

OBSERVABLE. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT THE COMPANY'S OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE INPUTS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN

KNOWLEDGEABLE, UNRELATED, WILLING PARTIES, I.E., NOT IN A FORCED TRANSACTION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MAY DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED IF THE

SECURITY WAS SOLD IN AN IMMEDIATE SALE, E.G., A FORCED TRANSACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE LESS LIQUID DUE TO THE LACK OF MARKET BASED

INPUTS, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE PRICE AT WHICH AN ACTUAL TRANSACTION WOULD OCCUR.

FOR

INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, THE COMPANY USES THE UNADJUSTED QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDES THESE PRICES IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN

LEVEL 1 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES FROM THIRD PARTY, NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICES. WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE UNAVAILABLE, THE COMPANY UTILIZES

THESE PRICING SERVICES TO DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES PROVIDED FROM THESE PRICING SERVICES ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. IF

QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND AN ESTIMATE FROM A PRICING SERVICE ARE UNAVAILABLE, THE COMPANY PRODUCES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE

LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, WILL RENDER THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE AS LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3. THE COMPANY BASES ALL OF ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR ASSETS ON THE BID PRICE AS IT

REPRESENTS WHAT A THIRD-PARTY MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY IN AN ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)

FIXED MATURITIES

THE COMPANY UTILIZED A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 98% OF ITS FIXED MATURITIES AT BOTH

DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015. THE PRICING SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. SINCE FIXED MATURITIES OTHER THAN U.S.

TREASURY SECURITIES GENERALLY DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY BASIS, THE PRICING SERVICE PREPARES ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR THESE SECURITIES USING ITS PROPRIETARY PRICING APPLICATIONS, WHICH

INCLUDE AVAILABLE RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, BENCHMARK CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR GROUPINGS AND MATRIX PRICING. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRICING SERVICE USES AN OPTION ADJUSTED SPREAD

MODEL TO DEVELOP PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS.

THE

PRICING SERVICE EVALUATES EACH ASSET CLASS BASED ON RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, RELEVANT CREDIT INFORMATION, PERCEIVED MARKET MOVEMENTS AND SECTOR NEWS. THE MARKET INPUTS UTILIZED

IN THE PRICING EVALUATION, LISTED IN THE APPROXIMATE ORDER OF PRIORITY, INCLUDE: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES, BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, TWO-SIDED MARKETS, BENCHMARK SECURITIES, BIDS,

OFFERS, REFERENCE DATA, AND INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. THE EXTENT OF THE USE OF EACH MARKET INPUT DEPENDS ON THE ASSET CLASS AND THE MARKET CONDITIONS. DEPENDING ON THE SECURITY, THE PRIORITY OF

THE USE OF INPUTS MAY CHANGE OR SOME MARKET INPUTS MAY NOT BE RELEVANT. FOR SOME SECURITIES, ADDITIONAL INPUTS MAY BE NECESSARY.

THE

PRICING SERVICE UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL ONLY PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IF THERE IS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE INFORMATION TO PRODUCE A VALUATION. IF

THE PRICING SERVICE DISCONTINUES PRICING AN INVESTMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE USING SOME OF THE SAME METHODOLOGIES AS THE PRICING SERVICE BUT WOULD HAVE TO

MAKE

ASSUMPTIONS FOR ANY MARKET-BASED INPUTS THAT WERE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE AND COMPARES THE ESTIMATES TO

THE COMPANY'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE MARKET TO DETERMINE IF THE ESTIMATES OBTAINED ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PRICES IN THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS PERIODIC DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRICING SERVICE

TO DISCUSS AND UNDERSTAND ANY CHANGES IN PROCESS AND THEIR RESPONSIVENESS TO CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE MARKETS. THE COMPANY ALSO MONITORS ALL MONTHLY PRICE CHANGES AND FURTHER EVALUATES ANY SECURITIES

WHOSE VALUE CHANGED MORE THAN 10% FROM THE PRIOR MONTH. THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS OTHER PROCESSES INCLUDING RANDOMLY SELECTING PURCHASED OR SOLD SECURITIES AND COMPARING EXECUTION PRICES TO

THE ESTIMATES FROM THE PRICING SERVICE AS WELL AS REVIEWING SECURITIES WHOSE VALUATION DID NOT CHANGE FROM THEIR PREVIOUS VALUATION (STALE PRICE REVIEW). THE COMPANY ALSO USES A SECOND INDEPENDENT

PRICING SERVICE TO FURTHER TEST THE PRIMARY PRICING SERVICE'S VALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO. THESE PROCESSES HAVE NOT HIGHLIGHTED ANY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH THE FAIR VALUE

ESTIMATES RECEIVED FROM THE PRIMARY PRICING SERVICE.

THE

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF MOST FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION RATHER THAN MARKET QUOTES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH FIXED

MATURITIES, OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES IS INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 AS THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON UNADJUSTED MARKET PRICES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HOLDS CERTAIN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE NOT PRICED BY THE PRICING SERVICE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH FIXED MATURITIES USING AN

INTERNAL MATRIX THAT IS BASED ON MARKET INFORMATION REGARDING INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND LIQUIDITY. THE UNDERLYING SOURCE DATA FOR CALCULATING THE MATRIX OF CREDIT SPREADS RELATIVE TO THE U.S.

TREASURY CURVE ARE THE BOFA

MERRILL

LYNCH U.S. CORPORATE INDEX AND THE BOFA MERRILL LYNCH HIGH YIELD BB RATED INDEX. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF THESE CORPORATE BONDS IN LEVEL 2, SINCE ALL SIGNIFICANT

INPUTS ARE MARKET OBSERVABLE.

WHILE

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2, THE COMPANY HOLDS A NUMBER OF MUNICIPAL BONDS AND CORPORATE BONDS WHICH ARE NOT VALUED BY THE

PRICING SERVICE AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL PRICING MATRIX WITH SOME UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUATION. DUE TO THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF

OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THESE PARTICULAR BONDS IN LEVEL 3. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY USED AN INTERNAL

PRICING MATRIX WAS $99 MILLION AND $101 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL AMOUNT OF OTHER FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS

THAT HAVE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE THEM UNSUITABLE FOR MATRIX PRICING. FOR THESE FIXED MATURITIES, THE COMPANY OBTAINS A QUOTE FROM A BROKER (PRIMARILY THE MARKET MAKER). THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED

MATURITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY RECEIVED A BROKER QUOTE WAS $85 MILLION AND

$117 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. DUE TO THE DISCLAIMERS ON THE QUOTES THAT INDICATE THAT THE PRICE IS INDICATIVE ONLY, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THESE FAIR VALUE

ESTIMATES IN LEVEL 3.

EQUITY SECURITIESPUBLIC COMMON STOCK AND NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK

FOR PUBLIC COMMON STOCK AND NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, THE COMPANY RECEIVES PRICES FROM PRICING SERVICES THAT ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE

MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND INCLUDES THESE ESTIMATES IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1. WHEN CURRENT MARKET QUOTES IN ACTIVE MARKETS ARE UNAVAILABLE FOR CERTAIN NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS

HELD BY THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FROM THE PRICING SERVICES. THE SERVICES UTILIZE SIMILAR METHODOLOGIES TO PRICE THE NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS AS THEY DO FOR

THE FIXED MATURITIES. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE FOR THESE NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS PUBLICLY-TRADED SECURITIES WHICH ARE REPORTED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS. THESE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MUTUAL

FUNDS AND OTHER SMALL HOLDINGS. THE $17 MILLION AND $18 MILLION FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY, WAS DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE COMPANY HELD INVESTMENTS IN NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES, WITH FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF $36 MILLION AND $38 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, REPORTED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS, WHERE THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE IS DETERMINED EITHER INTERNALLY OR BY AN EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER BASED ON RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET

STABILITY, GROWTH AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTALS. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN THESE VALUATIONS, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE FOR ALL OF THESE

INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 3.

DERIVATIVES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HELD $2 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE BONDS CONTAINING EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS THAT ARE VALUED

SEPARATELY FROM THE HOST BOND CONTRACT IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2FIXED MATURITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE COMPANY HELD NO SUCH CONVERTIBLE BONDS.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZED A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE FOR APPROXIMATELY 98% AND 99% OF SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. A DESCRIPTION OF

THE PROCESS AND INPUTS USED BY THE PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE IS DISCUSSED IN THE "

FIXED MATURITIES

" SECTION ABOVE. ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE

FOR U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS ARE BASED ON MARKET QUOTATIONS RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE AND ARE DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE FAIR VALUE OF OTHER

SHORT-TERM FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES IS ESTIMATED BY THE PRICING SERVICE USING OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS AND IS DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. FOR SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WHERE AN ESTIMATE

IS NOT OBTAINED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE, THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE AND IS INCLUDED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE HIERARCHY.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZED A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE FOR 100% OF ITS DEBT, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015. THE PRICING SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET

QUOTATIONS FOR DEBT THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. SINCE FIXED MATURITIES OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES GENERALLY DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY BASIS, THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON

MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY.

THE

COMPANY HAD NO MATERIAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT WERE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015.

5. REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF ASSUMED AND CEDED REINSURANCE

TRANSACTIONS. ASSUMED REINSURANCE REFERS TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS THAT OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN. CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES TRANSFERRING CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS

(ALONG WITH THE RELATED WRITTEN AND EARNED PREMIUMS) THE COMPANY HAS UNDERWRITTEN TO OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO AGREE TO SHARE THESE RISKS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF CEDED REINSURANCE IS TO

194

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

5. REINSURANCE (CONTINUED)

PROTECT

THE COMPANY, AT A COST, FROM LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT IT IS PREPARED TO ACCEPT AND TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL. REINSURANCE IS PLACED ON BOTH A QUOTA-SHARE AND EXCESS-OF-LOSS BASIS.

CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT DISCHARGE THE COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY INSURER, EXCEPT FOR INSTANCES WHERE THE PRIMARY POLICY OR POLICIES HAVE BEEN NOVATED, SUCH AS IN CERTAIN STRUCTURED

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A CORPORATE CATASTROPHE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATY WITH UNAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES AND TO PROTECT

ITS CAPITAL. IN ADDITION TO THE COVERAGE PROVIDED UNDER THIS TREATY, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES CATASTROPHE BONDS TO PROTECT AGAINST CERTAIN WEATHER-RELATED AND EARTHQUAKE LOSSES IN THE NORTHEASTERN

UNITED STATES, AND A NORTHEAST CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY TO PROTECT AGAINST LOSSES RESULTING FROM WEATHER-RELATED AND EARTHQUAKE CATASTROPHES IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ALSO

UTILIZES EXCESS-OF-LOSS TREATIES TO PROTECT AGAINST EARTHQUAKE LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN THRESHOLD IN BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE (FOR CERTAIN MARKETS) AND FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE, AND SEVERAL

REINSURANCE TREATIES SPECIFIC TO ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

THE

COMPANY MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO EVALUATE THE COLLECTABILITY OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS AND AS A BASIS FOR

DETERMINING THE REINSURERS WITH WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ONGOING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS.

SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO DETERMINE THE COMPANY'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE

COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE AMOUNTS RELATED TO INVOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS

THROUGH ASSUMED REINSURANCE, PRINCIPALLY WITH REGARD TO RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS IN WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, AS WELL AS HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE IN CERTAIN COASTAL AREAS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY PROVIDES SERVICES FOR SEVERAL OF THESE INVOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS (MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS) UNDER WHICH IT WRITES SUCH RESIDUAL MARKET BUSINESS DIRECTLY, THEN CEDES 100%

OF THIS BUSINESS TO THE MANDATORY POOL. SUCH PARTICIPATIONS AND SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ARRANGED TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY, AS ANY CEDED BALANCES ARE JOINTLY BACKED BY ALL THE POOL

MEMBERS.

ALSO

INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS ARE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

SETTLE CERTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE THE COMPANY DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE

STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT IS INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED CLAIM COST IS INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, AS THE COMPANY RETAINS THE

CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IF IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PAY, THE COMPANY WOULD RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF THE RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE IF, AND TO

THE EXTENT, THE PURCHASED ANNUITIES ARE NOT COVERED BY STATE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM

THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY AUTHORIZED THROUGH DECEMBER 31,

2020 THAT PROVIDES FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM.

IN

ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS AND MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS

AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. THE ANNUAL AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS

MINIMUM UNDER THE PROGRAM IS $140 MILLION FOR 2017, BUT WILL INCREASE OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM TO

196

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

5. REINSURANCE (CONTINUED)

$200 MILLION

BY DECEMBER 31, 2020. THE PROGRAM EXCLUDES FROM PARTICIPATION THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE: FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE, PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY

INSURANCE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE, HEALTH OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD INSURANCE, REINSURANCE, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY (OTHER THAN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS'), SURETY, BURGLARY

AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS MULTI-PERIL. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS' COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE PROGRAM. ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED

IN THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER, IN EXCHANGE FOR MAKING TERRORISM INSURANCE AVAILABLE, IS ENTITLED TO BE

REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR 83% OF SUBJECT LOSSES IN 2017, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP. THIS REIMBURSEMENT PERCENTAGE WILL DECREASE OVER THE REMAINING FOUR-YEAR

LIFE OF THE PROGRAM TO 80% OF SUBJECT LOSSES BY DECEMBER 31, 2020.

THE

DEDUCTIBLE FOR ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS EQUAL TO 20% OF THE INSURER'S DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS FOR COVERED LINES FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER

THE PROGRAM IS $2.45 BILLION FOR 2017. THE ANNUAL CAP LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE

$100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, PARTICIPATING INSURERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM FOR ADDITIONAL COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES FOR THAT PROGRAM YEAR. THERE HAVE BEEN NO

TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES THAT HAVE TRIGGERED PROGRAM COVERAGE SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED. SINCE THE LAW IS UNTESTED, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW IT WILL BE APPLIED IF AN ACT OF

TERRORISM IS CERTIFIED UNDER THE PROGRAM. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ACTION COULD CHANGE OR ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM. FURTHER, GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM

LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN THE COMPANY'S OWN REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL

EVENTS, COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS

ARISING FROM A HIGH FREQUENCY OF HIGH SEVERITY NATURAL CATASTROPHES AND/OR OF MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL MEANS. WHILE THE COMPANY SEEKS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO MAN-MADE

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL MEANS, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ONE OR MORE MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING NUCLEAR,

BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL MEANS.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION ARE COMPRISED OF FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ON CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND OTHER

CONTRACT AND CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLES. FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH INSURANCE ACQUISITIONS WERE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF NOMINAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE METHOD USED CALCULATED A RISK ADJUSTMENT TO A RISK-FREE DISCOUNTED RESERVE THAT WOULD, IF RESERVES RAN OFF AS EXPECTED, PRODUCE RESULTS THAT YIELDED THE

ASSUMED COST-OF-CAPITAL ON THE CAPITAL SUPPORTING THE LOSS RESERVES. THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AND THE AMOUNTS MEASURED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACQUIRER'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS PART OF THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS ARE BEING RECOGNIZED INTO INCOME OVER THE EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERN. BECAUSE THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND THE RISK ADJUSTMENT (COST OF CAPITAL) COMPONENTS OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS RUN OFF AT

DIFFERENT RATES, THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN INCOME MAY BE A NET BENEFIT IN SOME PERIODS AND A NET EXPENSE IN OTHER PERIODS.

AMORTIZATION

EXPENSE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS $11 MILLION, $26 MILLION AND $46 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IS ESTIMATED TO BE $9 MILLION IN 2017, $8 MILLION IN 2018, $6 MILLION IN 2019, $5 MILLION IN 2020 AND $5 MILLION IN 2021.

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)

METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED (IBNR) RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT

CALCULATION OF THE LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, PRIMARILY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION METHODS THAT DEVELOP ESTIMATES FOR THE ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. BECAUSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENT, CURRENTLY ESTIMATED CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES MAY CHANGE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS CHANGES TO THE RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED.

CUMULATIVE

AMOUNTS PAID AND CASE RESERVES HELD AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE ARE SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO DERIVE

INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED (IBNR) RESERVES. ACCORDINGLY, IBNR RESERVES INCLUDE THE COST OF UNREPORTED CLAIMS, DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS AND RE-OPENED CLAIMS. THIS APPROACH TO ESTIMATING IBNR RESERVES

HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR MANY YEARS, WITH NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN METHODOLOGY IN THE PAST YEAR.

DETAILED

CLAIM DATA IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE A RELIABLE INDICATION OF THE INITIAL ESTIMATE FOR ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR. AS A

RESULT, THE INITIAL ESTIMATE FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR IS GENERALLY BASED ON AN EXPOSURE-BASED METHOD USING EITHER THE LOSS RATIO PROJECTION OR THE EXPECTED LOSS METHOD. THE LOSS RATIO PROJECTION METHOD,

WHICH IS TYPICALLY USED FOR GUARANTEED COST BUSINESS, DEVELOPS AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR BY MULTIPLYING EARNED PREMIUM FOR THE ACCIDENT

YEAR BY A PROJECTED LOSS RATIO. THE PROJECTED LOSS RATIO IS DETERMINED BY ANALYZING PRIOR PERIOD EXPERIENCE, AND ADJUSTING FOR LOSS COST TRENDS, RATE LEVEL DIFFERENCES, MIX OF BUSINESS CHANGES AND

OTHER KNOWN OR OBSERVED FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ACCIDENT YEAR RELATIVE TO PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS. THE EXPECTED LOSS METHOD, WHICH IS TYPICALLY USED FOR LOSS SENSITIVE BUSINESS, DEVELOPS AN INITIAL

ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR BY ANALYZING EXPOSURES BY ACCOUNT.

FOR

PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS, THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS ARE PRINCIPALLY USED BY THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES TO ESTIMATE THE ULTIMATE COST OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS ARE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS.



THE PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD ASSUMES THAT THE FUTURE CHANGE (POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE) IN CUMULATIVE PAID LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS

WILL OCCUR IN A STABLE, PREDICTABLE PATTERN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR, CONSISTENT WITH THE PATTERN OBSERVED IN PAST COHORTS.



THE CASE INCURRED DEVELOPMENT METHOD IS THE SAME AS THE PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD BUT IS BASED ON CUMULATIVE CASE-INCURRED LOSSES RATHER

THAN PAID LOSSES.



THE BORNHUETTER-FERGUSON METHOD USES AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE RESERVE COMPONENT, TYPICALLY EXPRESSED AS

A RATIO TO EARNED PREMIUM. THE METHOD ASSUMES THAT THE RATIO OF ADDITIONAL CLAIM ACTIVITY TO EARNED PREMIUM FOR THAT COMPONENT IS RELATIVELY STABLE AND PREDICTABLE OVER TIME AND THAT ACTUAL CLAIM

ACTIVITY TO DATE IS NOT A CREDIBLE PREDICTOR OF FURTHER ACTIVITY FOR THAT COMPONENT. THE METHOD IS USED MOST OFTEN FOR MORE RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS WHERE CLAIM DATA IS SPARSE AND/OR VOLATILE, WITH A

TRANSITION TO OTHER METHODS AS THE UNDERLYING CLAIM DATA BECOMES MORE VOLUMINOUS AND THEREFORE MORE CREDIBLE.

214

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)



THE AVERAGE VALUE ANALYSIS COMBINED WITH THE REPORTED CLAIM DEVELOPMENT METHOD ASSUMES THAT AVERAGE CLAIM VALUES ARE STABLE AND PREDICTABLE

OVER TIME FOR A PARTICULAR COHORT OF CLAIMS. IT IS TYPICALLY LIMITED TO ANALYSIS AT MORE GRANULAR LEVELS, SUCH AS COVERAGE OR HAZARD/PERIL, WHERE A MORE HOMOGENEOUS SUBSET OF CLAIMS PRODUCE A MORE

STABLE AND FAIRLY PREDICTABLE AVERAGE VALUE. THE REPORTED CLAIM DEVELOPMENT METHOD IS THE SAME AS THE PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD BUT USES CHANGES IN CUMULATIVE CLAIM COUNTS TO PRODUCE ESTIMATES OF

ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS RATHER THAN ULTIMATE DOLLARS. THE RESULTING ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS BY COHORT IS MULTIPLIED BY AN AVERAGE VALUE PER CLAIM FROM AN AVERAGE VALUE ANALYSIS TO OBTAIN

ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

WHILE

THESE ARE THE PRINCIPAL METHODS UTILIZED, THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM THE FULL RANGE OF ACTUARIAL METHODS DEVELOPED BY THE CASUALTY ACTUARIAL PROFESSION. THE

COMPANY'S ACTUARIES ARE ALSO CONTINUALLY MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE PROFESSION FOR ADVANCES IN EXISTING TECHNIQUES OR THE CREATION OF NEW TECHNIQUES THAT MIGHT IMPROVE CURRENT AND FUTURE

ESTIMATES. MOST ACTUARIAL

METHODS ASSUME THAT PAST PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED IN THE DATA WILL REPEAT THEMSELVES IN THE FUTURE. FOR CERTAIN RESERVE COMPONENTS WHERE THIS ASSUMPTION MAY NOT HOLD, SUCH AS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES, CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY.

METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF REPORTED CLAIMS

A CLAIM FILE IS CREATED WHEN THE COMPANY IS NOTIFIED OF AN ACTUAL DEMAND FOR PAYMENT, NOTIFIED OF AN EVENT THAT MAY LEAD TO A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT

OR WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT COULD POSSIBLY LEAD TO A FUTURE DEMAND FOR PAYMENT ON ANOTHER COVERAGE ON THE SAME POLICY OR ON ANOTHER POLICY. CLAIM FILES ARE GENERALLY CREATED FOR

A POLICY AT THE CLAIMANT BY COVERAGE LEVEL, DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE UNDERLYING EVENT.

FOR

BUSINESS AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE AND FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE, CLAIM FILE INFORMATION IS SUMMARIZED SUCH THAT THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECOGNIZES ONE COUNT FOR EACH POLICY CLAIM EVENT

BY INTERNAL REGULATORY LINE OF BUSINESS, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS OR COVERAGES INVOLVED. THE CLAIMS COUNTS ARE THEN ACCUMULATED AND REPORTED BY PRODUCT LINE. WHILE THE METHODOLOGY IS

GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITHIN EACH SEGMENT FOR THE PRODUCT LINES DISPLAYED, THERE ARE SOME MINOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AND WITHIN SEGMENTS. FOR BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

ONE COUNT PER COVERAGE PER POLICY CLAIM EVENT.

FOR

PURPOSES OF THE CLAIMS DEVELOPMENT TABLES ABOVE, CLAIMS REPORTED FOR DIRECT BUSINESS ARE COUNTED EVEN IF THEY EVENTUALLY CLOSE WITH NO LOSS PAYMENT, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF

(I) DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS, WHERE THE CLAIM IS NOT COUNTED UNTIL THE CASE INCURRED CLAIM ESTIMATE IS ABOVE THE DEDUCTIBLE, AND (II) INTERNATIONAL-CANADA REPORTED CLAIM COUNTS WHERE CLAIMS

CLOSED WITH NO LOSS PAYMENT ARE NOT COUNTED. NOTE THAT CLAIMS WITH ZERO CLAIM DOLLARS MAY STILL GENERATE SOME LEVEL OF CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. CLAIM COUNTS FOR ASSUMED BUSINESS ARE INCLUDED ONLY TO

THE EXTENT SUCH COUNTS ARE AVAILABLE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT RECEIVE CLAIM COUNT INFORMATION FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING CLAIM ACTIVITY IS HANDLED BY OTHERS, INCLUDING POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT GENERATE CLAIM COUNTS FOR CEDED BUSINESS. THE METHODS USED TO SUMMARIZE CLAIM COUNTS HAVE NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE TIME PERIODS REPORTED IN THE TABLES ABOVE.

THE

COMPANY CAUTIONS AGAINST USING THE SUMMARIZED CLAIM COUNT INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS DISCLOSURE IN ATTEMPTING TO PROJECT ULTIMATE LOSS PAYOUTS BY PRODUCT LINE. THE COMPANY

GENERALLY FINDS CLAIM COUNT DATA TO BE USEFUL ONLY ON A MORE GRANULAR BASIS THAN THE AGGREGATED BASIS DISCLOSED IN THE

215

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)

CLAIM

DEVELOPMENT TABLES ABOVE, AS THE RISKS, AVERAGE VALUES AND OTHER DYNAMICS OF THE CLAIM PROCESS CAN VARY MATERIALLY BY THE CAUSE OF LOSS AND COVERAGE WITHIN PRODUCT LINE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN PERSONAL

AUTOMOBILE, THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE COVERAGE FEATURE SEVERAL YEARS AGO RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CLAIM COUNTS WITH A LOW AVERAGE CLAIM COST. FOR THIS REASON THE

COMPANY VARIES ITS APPROACH TO, AND IN MANY CASES THE LEVEL OF AGGREGATION FOR, COUNTING CLAIMS FOR INTERNAL ANALYSIS PURPOSES DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR GRANULAR ANALYSIS PERFORMED.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INCLUDED $1.71 BILLION AND

$2.17 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS, NET OF REINSURANCE.

IT

IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS DUE TO THE VAGARIES OF COURT COVERAGE DECISIONS, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, THE

RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE WHICH ARE SET FORTH BELOW.

ASBESTOS RESERVES.

BECAUSE EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE

EXPOSURE PRESENTED

BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AT LEAST ANNUALLY. AMONG THE FACTORS WHICH THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER IN THE COURSE OF THIS REVIEW ARE: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS

INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM

ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS

CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A

PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM.

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2016, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IN-DEPTH ASBESTOS CLAIM REVIEW, INCLUDING A REVIEW OF ACTIVE POLICYHOLDERS AND LITIGATION CASES FOR POTENTIAL PRODUCT AND

"NON-PRODUCT" LIABILITY, AND NOTED THE CONTINUATION OF THE FOLLOWING TRENDS.



CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS INVOLVING INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS ASBESTOS-RELATED ILLNESS, PRIMARILY

INVOLVING MESOTHELIOMA CLAIMS;



WHILE OVERALL PAYMENT PATTERNS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY STABLE, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN SEVERITY FOR CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS DUE TO THE

CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY; AND



CONTINUED MODERATE LEVEL OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCY ACTIVITY.

IN

THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE CATEGORY, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICYHOLDERS WITH ACTIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS, THE NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING ASBESTOS

CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS WITH OPEN ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BOTH GROSS AND NET ASBESTOS-RELATED PAYMENTS DECLINED SLIGHTLY WHEN COMPARED TO 2015. PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF

POLICYHOLDERS IN THIS CATEGORY CONTINUE TO BE INFLUENCED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WHERE INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS ASBESTOS-RELATED INJURY,

PRIMARILY

216

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)

MESOTHELIOMA,

CONTINUE TO TARGET DEFENDANTS WHO WERE NOT TRADITIONALLY PRIMARY TARGETS OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION.

THE

COMPANY'S QUARTERLY ASBESTOS RESERVE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANALYZES DEVELOPING PAYMENT PATTERNS AMONG POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE, AND ASSUMED REINSURANCE AND OTHER

CATEGORIES AS WELL AS PROJECTED REINSURANCE BILLINGS AND RECOVERIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE, YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY

EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES NOR HAVE THE COMPANY'S

EVALUATIONS RESULTED IN ANY WAY OF DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY PAYMENT.

THE

COMPLETION OF THESE REVIEWS AND ANALYSES IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014 RESULTED IN $225 MILLION, $224 MILLION AND $250 MILLION INCREASES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE COMPANY'S

NET ASBESTOS RESERVES. IN EACH YEAR, THE RESERVE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF PROJECTED SETTLEMENT AND DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO A BROAD NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE CATEGORY DUE TO A HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY SURROUNDING MESOTHELIOMA CLAIMS. THIS INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATE OF PROJECTED

SETTLEMENT AND DEFENSE COSTS RESULTED FROM PAYMENT TRENDS THAT CONTINUE TO BE HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT DISCUSSED ABOVE. OVER THE PAST

DECADE, THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, HAS EXPERIENCED NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WITH REGARD TO ASBESTOS RESERVES, BUT THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT OVER THAT PERIOD THERE HAS BEEN A REDUCTION IN THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S OVERALL ASBESTOS EXPOSURE AS THE OVERALL ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT HAS EVOLVED FROM ONE DOMINATED BY

EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RISKS, PARTICULARLY COVERAGE DISPUTES RELATING TO POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHO WERE ASSERTING THAT THEIR CLAIMS WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THE AGGREGATE LIMITS CONTAINED

IN THEIR POLICIES, TO AN ENVIRONMENT PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A FREQUENCY OF LITIGATION RELATED TO INDIVIDUALS WITH MESOTHELIOMA. THE COMPANY'S OVERALL VIEW OF THE CURRENT UNDERLYING ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT

IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM RECENT PERIODS AND THERE REMAINS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

NET

ASBESTOS PAID LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSES IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014 WERE $708 MILLION, $770 MILLION AND $242 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NET PAYMENTS IN 2016 INCLUDED THE

PAYMENT OF THE $518 MILLION SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS RELATED TO PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. NET PAYMENTS IN 2015 INCLUDED THE PAYMENT OF THE $502 MILLION SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE

SETTLEMENT OF ASBESTOS DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 16. APPROXIMATELY 69%, 69% AND 8% OF TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO

POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANY'S LIABILITY.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

IN ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND

THE ANTICIPATED

COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE AND RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS: THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH

SITE; THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE;

THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

217

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)

COMPANY

AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE

COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH

JURISDICTION. THE EVALUATION OF THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY A POLICYHOLDER CAN CHANGE AS INFORMATION CONCERNING THAT POLICYHOLDER AND THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED IS DEVELOPED. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL

METHODS ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE NOTICES FROM POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME, FREQUENTLY UNDER POLICIES ISSUED PRIOR TO THE MID-1980S. THESE POLICYHOLDERS CONTINUE TO

PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE LOWER TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, IN MANY INSTANCES, CLEAN-UP COSTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT RISK-BASED

SITE ANALYSES AND MORE EFFICIENT CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED GENERALLY FAVORABLE TRENDS IN THE NUMBER OF NEW POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IN THE NUMBER OF PENDING DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. HOWEVER, THE DEGREE TO WHICH THOSE FAVORABLE TRENDS HAVE CONTINUED HAS BEEN LESS

THAN ANTICIPATED. IN ADDITION, RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS HAS BEEN GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED, DRIVEN BY CLAIMS AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS. AS

A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $82 MILLION, $72 MILLION AND $87 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DISCUSSED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES

CARRIED FOR

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE

CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW

INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE

BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE, AND/OR THE NUMBER OF, ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED, THE EMERGENCE OF A GREATER NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS THAN ANTICIPATED AS A RESULT OF EXTENDED LIFE EXPECTANCIES RESULTING FROM MEDICAL ADVANCES AND LIFESTYLE

IMPROVEMENTS, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION

OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS. IN ADDITION, UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS ALSO NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS ENVIRONMENT COULD BE AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION AND FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR JUDICIAL REFORMS ESTABLISHING MEDICAL

CRITERIA FOR THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR

218

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)

COMPLETION

AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS

OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONTINUES

TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE

THE COMPANY HAS GEOGRAPHIC EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BY A VARIETY OF EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HURRICANES,

TORNADOES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS, VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND OTHER NATURALLY-OCCURRING EVENTS, SUCH AS SOLAR FLARES. CATASTROPHES CAN

ALSO RESULT FROM TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER INTENTIONALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTS INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, CYBER-ATTACKS, EXPLOSIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

FAILURES. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA

AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS; HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS,

ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO MITIGATE ITS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE.

THERE

ARE ALSO RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY OF THE

COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION

AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION

EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, INCLUDING HIGHER FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS;

INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS INCOME INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END

OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

DESCRIPTION OF DEBT

COMMERCIAL PAPER

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN $800 MILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, SUPPORTED BY A $1.0 BILLION BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT

EXPIRES ON JUNE 7, 2018. (SEE "CREDIT AGREEMENT" DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS.) INTEREST RATES ON COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED IN 2016 RANGED FROM 0.35% TO 0.55%, AND IN 2015 RANGED FROM 0.09% TO 0.30%.

SENIOR NOTES

THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS SENIOR DEBT ISSUES ARE UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS THAT RANK EQUALLY WITH ONE ANOTHER. INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE MADE

SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE COMPANY GENERALLY MAY REDEEM SOME OR ALL OF THE NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH TERMS UNIQUE TO EACH DEBT INSTRUMENT.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

THE COMPANY'S $107 MILLION REMAINING AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.25% FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE DEBENTURES BEAR

INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 6.25% FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE TO, BUT EXCLUDING, MARCH 15, 2017, PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON MARCH 15 AND SEPTEMBER 15. FROM AND INCLUDING

MARCH 15, 2017, THE DEBENTURES WILL BEAR INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 2.215%, PAYABLE QUARTERLY ON MARCH 15, JUNE 15, SEPTEMBER 15 AND

DECEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2017 AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT BEING REDEEMED PLUS ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT

ITS OPTION PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2017 (A) IN WHOLE AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME OR (B) IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN TAX OR RATING AGENCY EVENTS

RELATING TO THE DEBENTURES, AT A REDEMPTION

PRICE

EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT BEING REDEEMED AND THE APPLICABLE MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT, IN EACH CASE PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST.

THE

COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT, ON ONE OR MORE OCCASIONS, TO DEFER THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE DEBENTURES. THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE DEFERRED INTEREST UNTIL IT HAS

DEFERRED INTEREST FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OR, IF EARLIER, MADE A PAYMENT OF CURRENT INTEREST DURING A DEFERRAL PERIOD. THE COMPANY MAY DEFER INTEREST FOR UP TO TEN CONSECUTIVE YEARS WITHOUT GIVING

RISE TO AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. DEFERRED INTEREST WILL ACCUMULATE ADDITIONAL INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE EQUAL TO THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE THEN APPLICABLE TO THE DEBENTURES.

THE

DEBENTURES HAVE A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 15, 2067 AND A SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 15, 2037. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION ANY TIME

(AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) USING ANY SOURCE OF FUNDS, INCLUDING CASH. IF THE COMPANY CHOOSES NOT TO REDEEM THE DEBENTURES, THEN DURING THE 180-DAY PERIOD ENDING NOT MORE THAN 15 AND NOT LESS THAN TEN

BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO SELL ENOUGH QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES TO PERMIT REPAYMENT OF THE

DEBENTURES AT THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE. IF ANY DEBENTURES REMAIN OUTSTANDING AFTER THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, UNLESS AND UNTIL THE COMPANY REDEEMS THE DEBENTURES (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) USING ANY

SOURCE OF FUNDS, INCLUDING CASH, THE COMPANY SHALL BE REQUIRED TO USE ITS COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO RAISE SUFFICIENT PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF QUALIFYING CAPITAL

SECURITIES TO PERMIT THE REPAYMENT IN FULL OF THE DEBENTURES. IF THERE ARE REMAINING DEBENTURES AT THE FINAL MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO REDEEM THE DEBENTURES USING ANY SOURCE OF FUNDS.

QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES ARE SECURITIES (OTHER THAN COMMON STOCK, QUALIFYING WARRANTS, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON EQUITY, AND DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR

PREFERRED EQUITY) WHICH GENERALLY ARE TREATED BY THE RATINGS AGENCIES AS HAVING SIMILAR EQUITY CONTENT TO THE DEBENTURES.

THE

COMPANY'S THREE OTHER JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALL SIMILAR IN NATURE TO EACH OTHER. THREE SEPARATE BUSINESS TRUSTS ISSUED PREFERRED SECURITIES TO INVESTORS AND

USED THE PROCEEDS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES. INTEREST ON EACH OF THE INSTRUMENTS IS PAID SEMI-ANNUALLY.

THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDES THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS ACQUISITION, WHICH WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE RESULTING

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING THE

EFFECTIVE-INTEREST METHOD. THE AMORTIZATION OF THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT REDUCED INTEREST EXPENSE BY $2 MILLION AND $1 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015,

RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT AGREEMENT

THE COMPANY IS PARTY TO A FIVE-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT EXPIRES ON

JUNE 7, 2018. PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT COVENANTS, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH, DEFINED AS SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP PLUS

(A) TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES (NOT TO EXCEED 15% OF TOTAL CAPITAL) AND (B) MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES (COMBINED WITH TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, NOT TO EXCEED 25% OF TOTAL

CAPITAL) LESS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OF $13.73 BILLION. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS OTHER CUSTOMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF

DEFAULT, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO A CHANGE IN CONTROL, WHICH IS DEFINED TO INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF 35% OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S VOTING STOCK AND CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. GENERALLY, THE COST OF BORROWING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL RANGE FROM LIBOR PLUS 87.5 BASIS POINTS

TO LIBOR PLUS 150 BASIS POINTS, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, THAT COST WOULD HAVE BEEN LIBOR PLUS 112.5 BASIS POINTS, HAD THERE BEEN ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING

UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO SUPPORTS THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.

SHELF REGISTRATION

IN JUNE 2016, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT EXPIRES ON

JUNE 17, 2019 FOR THE POTENTIAL OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES TO REPLACE THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT HAD EXPIRED THREE YEARS AFTER ITS EFFECTIVE DATE. THE

COMPANY MAY OFFER THESE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF OFFERING.

DURING

THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED $72 MILLION AND $74 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THESE PLANS.

COMMON

SHARES ACQUIRED ARE REPORTED AS TREASURY STOCK IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, DOMICILED PRINCIPALLY IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT, ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS

THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO BE PAID BY EACH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY TO ITS RESPECTIVE PARENT COMPANY WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. A MAXIMUM OF

$3.69 BILLION IS AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2017 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS TO THE HOLDING COMPANY, TRV, WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE TO

ACCELERATE THE TIMING WITHIN 2017 AND/OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2017, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CERTAIN DIVIDENDS BEING SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE CONNECTICUT

INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.

IN

ADDITION TO THE REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE PAID BY THE COMPANY'S U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT MAY BE

PAID TO THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS IS LIMITED, TO A LESSER DEGREE, BY CERTAIN COVENANTS CONTAINED IN ITS LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

MAINTAIN A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 8.

TRV

IS NOT DEPENDENT ON DIVIDENDS OR OTHER FORMS OF REPATRIATION FROM ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN

OPERATIONS ARE NOT MATERIAL AND ARE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE OPERATIONS.

TRV

AND ITS TWO NON-INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES RECEIVED DIVIDENDS OF $3.05 BILLION, $3.75 BILLION AND $4.10 BILLION FROM THEIR U.S. INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR

THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014, TRV DECLARED CASH DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE OF $2.62, $2.38 AND $2.15, RESPECTIVELY, AND PAID CASH DIVIDENDS OF

$757 MILLION, $739 MILLION AND $729 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS

STATUTORY NET INCOME OF THE COMPANY'S DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WAS $3.20 BILLION, $3.80 BILLION AND

$3.97 BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS OF THE COMPANY'S DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WAS

IF

THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT ANY OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT RESULT IN FUTURE TAX BENEFITS, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE MUST BE ESTABLISHED FOR THE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS THAT ARE

NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCREASED BY $3 MILLION IN 2016 RELATING TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BRAZILIAN SUBSIDIARY. BASED UPON A REVIEW OF THE COMPANY'S

ANTICIPATED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND ALSO INCLUDING ALL OTHER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED.

FOR

TAX RETURN PURPOSES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE COMPANY HAD NET OPERATING LOSS (NOL) CARRYFORWARDS IN BRAZIL AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REALIZING THE

BENEFITS OF NOL CARRYFORWARDS DEPEND ON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY TAX LAWS. ONLY THE BENEFITS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM NOL CARRYFORWARDS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE NOL AMOUNTS BY JURISDICTION AND YEAR OF EXPIRATION ARE AS FOLLOWS.

INCLUDED

IN THE BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 WERE $7 MILLION AND $4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT

THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE BALANCES AT THOSE DATES WERE $6 MILLION AND $12 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF TAX POSITIONS FOR WHICH THE ULTIMATE DEDUCTIBILITY IS

CERTAIN, BUT FOR WHICH THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING OF DEDUCTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF SUCH DEDUCTIBILITY WOULD NOT AFFECT THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES, IF ANY, RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN INCOME TAXES. DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZED APPROXIMATELY $31 MILLION, $(32) MILLION AND $31 MILLION IN INTEREST, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $57 MILLION AND $26 MILLION ACCRUED FOR

THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

IRS IS CONDUCTING AN EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2013 AND 2014. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ITS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

13. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS A SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN, THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2014 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN), THE PURPOSES OF

WHICH ARE TO ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY'S NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES WITH THOSE OF THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS AND TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN PERSONNEL BY

PROVIDING INCENTIVES IN THE FORM OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS. THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN PERMITS GRANTS OF NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK,

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED OR SHARE-DENOMINATED AWARDS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY

OF ISSUING NEW SHARES TO SETTLE THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTION AWARDS AND THE VESTING OF OTHER EQUITY AWARDS.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED (THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN) WAS

TERMINATED, JOINING SEVERAL OTHER LEGACY SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS THAT HAD BEEN TERMINATED IN PRIOR YEARS (TOGETHER, THE LEGACY PLANS). OUTSTANDING GRANTS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE

TERMINATION OF THE LEGACY PLANS. THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED.

THE

NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK INITIALLY AUTHORIZED FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN WAS 10 MILLION SHARES. IN MAY 2016, THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS

AUTHORIZED AN

232

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

13. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)

ADDITIONAL

4.4 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN. THE FOLLOWING ARE NOT COUNTED TOWARDS THE COMBINED 14.4 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE AND

WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN: (I) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO AWARDS THAT EXPIRE UNEXERCISED, THAT ARE FORFEITED, TERMINATED OR CANCELED, THAT ARE

SETTLED IN CASH OR OTHER FORMS OF PROPERTY, OR OTHERWISE DO NOT RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, IN WHOLE OR IN PART; (II) SHARES THAT ARE USED TO PAY THE EXERCISE PRICE OF

STOCK OPTIONS AND SHARES USED TO PAY WITHHOLDING TAXES ON AWARDS GENERALLY; AND (III) SHARES PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ON THE OPEN MARKET USING CASH OPTION EXERCISE PROCEEDS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,

THAT THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR GRANT PURSUANT TO SUCH MARKET PURCHASES SHALL NOT BE GREATER THAN THE NUMBER THAT COULD BE REPURCHASED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE ON

THE DATE OF EXERCISE OF THE STOCK OPTION GIVING RISE TO SUCH OPTION PROCEEDS. IN ADDITION, THE 14.4 MILLION SHARES AUTHORIZED BY SHAREHOLDERS FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN WILL BE

INCREASED BY ANY SHARES SUBJECT TO AWARDS UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN THAT WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 27, 2014 AND SUBSEQUENTLY EXPIRE, ARE FORFEITED, CANCELLED, SETTLED IN CASH OR OTHERWISE

TERMINATE WITHOUT THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS A COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS (THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM). UNDER THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION

CONSISTS OF AN ANNUAL RETAINER, A DEFERRED STOCK AWARD, COMMITTEE CHAIR FEES AND A LEAD DIRECTOR FEE. EACH NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR MAY CHOOSE TO RECEIVE ALL OR A PORTION OF HIS OR HER ANNUAL RETAINER IN

THE FORM OF CASH OR DEFERRED STOCK UNITS WHICH VEST UPON GRANT. THE ANNUAL DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS VEST IN FULL ONE DAY PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OCCURRING IN THE

YEAR FOLLOWING THE YEAR OF THE GRANT DATE, SUBJECT TO CONTINUED SERVICE. THE DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS, INCLUDING DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS, ACCUMULATE UNTIL DISTRIBUTION EITHER IN A LUMP SUM SIX MONTHS AFTER

TERMINATION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR OR, IF THE DIRECTOR SO ELECTS, IN ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS BEGINNING AT LEAST SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR. THE DEFERRED STOCK UNITS ISSUED

UNDER THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM ARE AWARDED UNDER THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN.

STOCK OPTION AWARDS

STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES HAVE A TEN-YEAR TERM. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2007, STOCK OPTIONS WERE

GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY PRECEDING THE DATE OF GRANT. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2007, ALL STOCK OPTIONS ARE GRANTED WITH

AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED GENERALLY VEST UPON MEETING CERTAIN YEARS OF SERVICE CRITERIA. EXCEPT AS THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY ALLOW IN THE FUTURE, STOCK OPTIONS CANNOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY THE PARTICIPANT. STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN AND

THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN GENERALLY VEST THREE YEARS AFTER GRANT DATE (CLIFF VEST).

THE

FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT BY APPLICATION OF A VARIATION OF THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL USING THE ASSUMPTIONS NOTED IN THE FOLLOWING

TABLE. THE EXPECTED TERM OF NEWLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS IS THE TIME TO VEST PLUS HALF THE REMAINING TIME TO EXPIRATION. THIS CONSIDERS THE VESTING RESTRICTION AND REPRESENTS AN EVEN PATTERN OF

EXERCISE BEHAVIOR OVER THE REMAINING TERM. THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK FOR THE SAME PERIOD AS THE ESTIMATED OPTION TERM BASED

ON THE MID-MONTH OF THE OPTION GRANT. THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S CURRENT QUARTER DIVIDEND ANNUALIZED AND ASSUMED TO BE CONSTANT OVER THE EXPECTED OPTION TERM. THE RISK-FREE

INTEREST RATE FOR EACH OPTION IS THE INTERPOLATED MARKET YIELD FOR THE MID-MONTH OF THE OPTION GRANT ON A U.S. TREASURY

AWARDS FOR WHICH THE REQUISITE SERVICE HAS BEEN RENDERED, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE.

ON

FEBRUARY 9, 2017, THE COMPANY, UNDER THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN, GRANTED 2,106,022 STOCK OPTION AWARDS WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $118.78 PER SHARE. THE FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

THE STOCK OPTION AWARDS ON THE DATE OF GRANT WAS $16.15 PER SHARE.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD PROGRAMS

THE COMPANY ISSUES RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES UNDER THE EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO

THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN. A RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT REPRESENTS THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS ARE GRANTED AT MARKET PRICE, GENERALLY VEST THREE YEARS

FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, DO NOT HAVE VOTING RIGHTS AND THE

234

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNDERLYING

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE NOT ISSUED UNTIL THE VESTING CRITERIA IS SATISFIED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS CAN BE ISSUED DEFERRED STOCK UNITS FROM (I) AN ANNUAL

AWARD; (II) DEFERRED COMPENSATION (IN LIEU OF CASH RETAINER); AND (III) DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS EARNED ON OUTSTANDING DEFERRED COMPENSATION.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS A PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN AND WHICH CONTINUES PURSUANT TO THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN. UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE

COMPANY MAY ISSUE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF VICE PRESIDENT (OR ITS EQUIVALENT) OR ABOVE. THE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS PROVIDE THE RECIPIENT THE

RIGHT TO EARN SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ATTAINMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE GOALS AND THE RECIPIENT MEETING CERTAIN YEARS OF SERVICE CRITERIA. THE PERFORMANCE GOALS

FOR PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ADJUSTED RETURN ON EQUITY OVER A THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. VESTING OF PERFORMANCE SHARES IS CONTINGENT UPON THE COMPANY ATTAINING THE

RELEVANT PERFORMANCE PERIOD MINIMUM THRESHOLD RETURN ON EQUITY AND THE RECIPIENT MEETING CERTAIN YEARS OF SERVICE CRITERIA, GENERALLY THREE YEARS FOR FULL VESTING, SUBJECT TO PRORATION FOR CERTAIN

TERMINATION CONDITIONS. IF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD RETURN ON EQUITY IS BELOW THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD, NONE OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL VEST. IF PERFORMANCE MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE

THRESHOLD, A RANGE OF PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL VEST (50% TO 150% FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN 2015, 2016 AND 2017), DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL RETURN ON EQUITY ATTAINED.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES IS MEASURED AT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY STOCK AT DATE OF GRANT. UNDER TERMS OF THE 2014

INCENTIVE PLAN, HOLDERS OF DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES MAY RECEIVE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS.

THE

TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF SHARES THAT VESTED DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 WAS $175 MILLION, $179 MILLION AND $147 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

13. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)

IN ADDITION TO THE NONVESTED SHARES PRESENTED IN THE ABOVE TABLE, THERE ARE RELATED NONVESTED DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT SHARES. THE NUMBER OF NONVESTED DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT SHARES RELATED TO

DEFERRED STOCK UNITS WAS 396 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND 408 AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND THE NUMBER OF NONVESTED DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT SHARES RELATED TO PERFORMANCE SHARES WAS 40,663 AT THE

BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND

28,480 AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME VESTING TERMS AS THE DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES.

ON

FEBRUARY 9, 2017, THE COMPANY, UNDER THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN, GRANTED 960,515 COMMON STOCK AWARDS IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARE

AWARDS TO PARTICIPATING OFFICERS, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND DEFERRED STOCK UNITS TOTALED 567,006 SHARES WHILE THE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS TOTALED

393,509 SHARES. THE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMMON STOCK AWARDS ON THE DATE OF GRANT WAS $118.78.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST RECOGNITION

THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A SERVICE CONDITION IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED AND IS

RECOGNIZED OVER THE TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH SERVICE IS TO BE PROVIDED (REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD). AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREE-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OR TO EMPLOYEES WHO BECOME RETIREE-ELIGIBLE BEFORE AN

AWARD'S VESTING DATE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE MET THE REQUISITE SERVICE CONDITION. THE COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A PERFORMANCE CONDITION IS BASED UPON THE PROBABLE OUTCOME OF THE

PERFORMANCE CONDITION, WHICH ON THE GRANT DATE REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF ATTAINING 100% OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED. THE COMPENSATION COST REFLECTS AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL FORFEITURE RATE FROM 3.0% TO

4.0% OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARDS. THAT ESTIMATE IS REVISED IF SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS EXPECTED TO VEST IS LIKELY TO DIFFER FROM

PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. COMPENSATION COSTS FOR AWARDS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. FOR AWARDS THAT HAVE GRADED VESTING TERMS, THE COMPENSATION COST IS

RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD FOR EACH SEPARATE VESTING PORTION OF THE AWARD AS IF THE AWARD WAS, IN SUBSTANCE, MULTIPLE AWARDS. THE TOTAL COMPENSATION COST FOR

ALL SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 WAS $155 MILLION, $141 MILLION AND $138 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS ARE COMPENSATION COST ADJUSTMENTS OF $11 MILLION, $8 MILLION AND $14 MILLION, FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014,

RESPECTIVELY, THAT REFLECTED THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPDATED ESTIMATE OF PERFORMANCE SHARES DUE TO ATTAINING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE LEVELS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL GRANT OF THE PERFORMANCE

AWARDS. THE RELATED TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WERE $52 MILLION, $47 MILLION AND $47 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016, THERE WAS $124 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO ALL NONVESTED SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS. THIS INCLUDES STOCK

OPTIONS, RESTRICTED AND DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE 2014 INCENTIVE PLAN AND THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN. THE UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED

OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.7 YEARS. CASH RECEIVED FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS UNDER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS TOTALED $332 MILLION AND $183 MILLION

IN 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX BENEFIT FOR TAX DEDUCTIONS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2016 AND 2015 TOTALED $58 MILLION AND $41 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN

2016, THE COMPANY BEGAN USING A FULL YIELD-CURVE APPROACH IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS FOR ITS QUALIFIED AND

NONQUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS AND ITS DOMESTIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. THE FULL YIELD CURVE APPROACH APPLIES THE SPECIFIC SPOT RATES ALONG THE YIELD CURVE THAT THE COMPANY USED TO

DETERMINE ITS PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS. PREVIOUSLY, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THESE SERVICE AND INTEREST

COST COMPONENTS BY APPLYING A SINGLE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM THIS YIELD CURVE. THIS CHANGE WAS MADE TO PROVIDE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET

PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS, CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR EACH OF THE BENEFIT PLANS.

THIS

CHANGE DID NOT AFFECT THE MEASUREMENT OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS THE CHANGE IN THE SERVICE COST AND INTEREST COST IS COMPLETELY OFFSET IN THE ACTUARIAL (GAIN)

LOSS REPORTED FOR THE PERIOD. THE CHANGE REDUCED THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS

FOR

2016 BY $6 MILLION AND $30 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND RESULTED IN AN $0.08 INCREASE IN DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE FOR 2016. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATES THAT WERE USED TO

MEASURE SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS DURING 2016 WERE 4.77% AND 3.64%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE DOMESTIC QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, 4.53% AND 3.47%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE DOMESTIC NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLAN

AND 0.00% AND 3.53%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE DOMESTIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN. THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF THE DOMESTIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN IS ZERO AS IT

IS A CLOSED PLAN AND ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE FULLY VESTED. UNDER THE COMPANY'S PRIOR ESTIMATION APPROACH, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE FOR BOTH THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS WOULD HAVE

BEEN 4.50% FOR THE DOMESTIC QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, 4.37% FOR THE DOMESTIC NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLAN AND 4.35% FOR THE DOMESTIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THIS CHANGE AS A

CHANGE IN ESTIMATE, AND ACCORDINGLY, RECOGNIZED THE EFFECT PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING IN 2016.

FOR

THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE ESTIMATED NET ACTUARIAL LOSS THAT WILL BE RECLASSIFIED (AMORTIZED) FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO NET INCOME AS PART OF NET

PERIODIC BENEFIT COST OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR IS $75 MILLION AND THE ESTIMATED PRIOR SERVICE BENEFIT TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR IS $1 MILLION. FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS, THE ESTIMATED NET ACTUARIAL GAIN THAT WILL BE RECLASSIFIED (AMORTIZED) FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO

NET INCOME AS PART OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR IS LESS THAN $1 MILLION, AND THE ESTIMATED PRIOR SERVICE BENEFIT TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR IS

$3 MILLION.

OUTFLOWS CORRESPOND WITH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYOUTS OF THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT PLAN, ARE APPLIED TO EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFITS PAYMENTS IN MEASURING THE PROJECTED

THE

DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION USED TO DETERMINE THE

NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST

IS THE SINGLE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM THE

YIELD CURVE USED TO MEASURE THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

IN

CHOOSING THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY SELECTED THE RATE THAT WAS SET AS THE RETURN OBJECTIVE BY THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT PLANS INVESTMENT COMMITTEE,

WHICH HAD CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL RETURNS OF EQUITY AND FIXED MATURITY MARKETS IN CONJUNCTION WITH PREVAILING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

AS

AN INDICATOR OF SENSITIVITY, INCREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $20 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016.

DECREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016 BY $17 MILLION AND THE AGGREGATE OF

THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016.

THE

ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN PENSION AND FOREIGN POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE COMPANY'S QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN

AND THE DOMESTIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN.

PLAN ASSETS

THE QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF THE PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES AND ARE INTENDED,

OVER TIME, TO SATISFY THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PLAN. RISK TOLERANCE IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH CONSIDERATION OF PLAN LIABILITIES, PLAN FUNDED STATUS AND CORPORATE FINANCIAL POSITION. THE ASSET

MIX GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO SERVE AS TOOLS TO FACILITATE THE INVESTMENT OF PLAN ASSETS TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM TOTAL RETURN AND THE

ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF THE PLAN'S INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. INVESTMENT RISK IS MEASURED AND MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS THROUGH DAILY AND MONTHLY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REVIEWS, ANNUAL LIABILITY

MEASUREMENTS AND PERIODIC ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES.

THE

COMPANY'S OVERALL INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR THE QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN IS TO ACHIEVE A MIX OF APPROXIMATELY 85% TO 90% OF INVESTMENTS FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND 10% TO 15% FOR

NEAR-TERM BENEFIT PAYMENTS WITH A DIVERSIFICATION OF ASSET TYPES, FUND STRATEGIES AND FUND MANAGERS. THE CURRENT TARGET ALLOCATIONS FOR PLAN ASSETS ARE 55% TO 65% EQUITY SECURITIES AND 20% TO 40%

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER ALLOCATED TO SHORT-TERM SECURITIES. EQUITY SECURITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN LARGE, MEDIUM AND SMALL-CAP COMPANIES PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE UNITED

STATES. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES INCLUDE CORPORATE BONDS OF COMPANIES FROM DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY FOREIGN

GOVERNMENTS. OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE TWO PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS HELD BY THE COMPANY'S QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN. ONE PRIVATE EQUITY FUND IS FOCUSED ON FINANCIAL COMPANIES, AND THE OTHER

IS FOCUSED ON REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS.

ASSETS

OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN PENSION PLANS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTPENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ASSETS

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE METHODS EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTED ASSETS, SEE NOTE 4. THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ASSETS.

FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES FOR EQUITY AND BOND MUTUAL FUNDS HELD BY THE PENSION PLANS REFLECT PRICES RECEIVED FROM AN EXTERNAL PRICING SERVICE THAT ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET TRANSACTIONS.

THESE ESTIMATES ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1.

SHORT-TERM

SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WHICH APPROXIMATES COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST OR AMORTIZED DISCOUNT. THE FAIR VALUE OR MARKET VALUE OF THESE IS PERIODICALLY COMPARED TO

THIS AMORTIZED COST AND IS BASED ON SIGNIFICANT OBSERVABLE INPUTS AS DETERMINED BY AN EXTERNAL PRICING SERVICE. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, OTHER THAN U.S.

TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS, PROVIDED BY AN EXTERNAL PRICING SERVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF U.S.

TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS IS INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 AS THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON UNADJUSTED MARKET PRICES.

SAVINGS PLAN

THE COMPANY HAS A SAVINGS PLAN, THE TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE SAVINGS PLAN), IN WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. DOMESTIC COMPANY EMPLOYEES

ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. UNDER THE SAVINGS PLAN, THE COMPANY MATCHES EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 5% OF ELIGIBLE PAY, WITH A MAXIMUM ANNUAL MATCH OF $6,000 WHICH BECOMES 100% VESTED AFTER THREE

YEARS OF SERVICE. THE COMPANY'S MATCHING CONTRIBUTION IS MADE IN CASH AND INVESTED ACCORDING TO THE EMPLOYEE'S CURRENT INVESTMENT ELECTIONS AND CAN BE REINVESTED INTO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE PLAN. THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN SEPARATE SAVINGS PLANS. THE TOTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO ALL OF THE SAVINGS PLANS WAS $114 MILLION,

$109 MILLION AND $103 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

ALL

COMMON SHARES HELD BY THE SAVINGS PLAN ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR BASIC AND DILUTED EPS COMPUTATIONS AND DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALL SHARES ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

CONTINGENCIES

THE MAJOR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS, TO WHICH THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES IS A PARTY OR TO WHICH ANY OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTIES IS SUBJECT ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AND CONTINUES TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FOR INSURANCE ARISING UNDER POLICIES

ISSUED BY THE COMPANY ASSERTING ALLEGED INJURIES AND DAMAGES FROM ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED EXPOSURES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION. THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING ASBESTOS-

AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES OF THESE DISPUTES ARE UNCERTAIN. IN THIS REGARD, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED

SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE, INCLUDING SETTLING LITIGATION UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO

PREDICT LEGAL OUTCOMES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. ANY SUCH DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT

DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT INSURANCE

RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

SETTLEMENT OF ASBESTOS DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION

IN 2001 AND 2002, A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, INCLUDING TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS, WERE FILED AGAINST CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY

(COLLECTIVELY OR INDIVIDUALLY, TRAVELERS) AND OTHER INSURERS IN STATE COURTS IN WEST VIRGINIA, MASSACHUSETTS AND HAWAII. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGED THAT THE INSURER DEFENDANTS HAD INAPPROPRIATELY HANDLED

AND SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN VIOLATION OF THOSE STATES' STATUTES REGULATING INSURANCE CLAIMS HANDLING AND/OR THOSE STATES' COMMON LAW. IN ALL THESE SUITS, THE PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT TO REOPEN LARGE

IN

RESPONSE TO THESE CLAIMS, TRAVELERS MOVED TO ENJOIN THE STATUTORY ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW ACTIONS IN THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT HAD PRESIDED OVER THE BANKRUPTCY OF ITS

FORMER POLICYHOLDER JOHNS-MANVILLE CORPORATION ON THE GROUND THAT THE SUITS VIOLATED INJUNCTIONS ENTERED IN CONNECTION WITH CONFIRMATION OF THE JOHNS-MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY (THE 1986 ORDERS). THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT ISSUED A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND REFERRED THE PARTIES TO MEDIATION, WHICH RESULTED IN SETTLEMENTS OF THE STATUTORY ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW ACTIONS (THE SETTLEMENTS). THE

SETTLEMENTS WERE CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER CONTINGENCIES, A FINAL ORDER CONFIRMING THAT THE 1986 ORDERS ENJOINED THE STATUTORY ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW ACTIONS AS WELL AS RELATED CONTRIBUTION

CLAIMS AGAINST TRAVELERS (THE CLARIFYING ORDER).

NUMEROUS

PROCEEDINGS TOOK PLACE IN THE BANKRUPTCY, DISTRICT AND APPELLATE COURTS CONCERNING THE ENTRY OF THE CLARIFYING ORDER AND APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENTS AND THEIR EFFECT ON OTHER

PARTIES.

IN

2009, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AFFIRMED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT'S ENTRY OF THE CLARIFYING ORDER ENJOINING THE STATUTORY ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW ACTIONS. THE SUPREME COURT

REMANDED THE CASE TO THE LOWER COURTS TO CONSIDER ANY PROPERLY PRESERVED OBJECTIONS. FOLLOWING RESOLUTION, AFTER REMAND, OF ONE REMAINING OBJECTION (REGARDING POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION CLAIMS AGAINST THE

COMPANY), AND ENTRY OF A FINAL JUDGMENT BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS, TRAVELERS MADE PAYMENT OF $579 MILLION TO THE PLAINTIFFS IN JANUARY 2015, COMPRISING

$502 MILLION PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENTS, PLUS PRE-JUDGMENT AND POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST TOTALING $77 MILLION. THE PAYMENT WAS FULLY ACCRUED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT ARISING UNDER INSURANCE CONTRACTS OR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN OTHER LAWSUITS, INCLUDING LAWSUITS ALLEGING EXTRA-CONTRACTUAL DAMAGES RELATING TO INSURANCE CONTRACTS OR REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS, THAT DO NOT ARISE UNDER INSURANCE CONTRACTS OR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LAWSUITS ARE

EXPENSED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE COSTS ARE INCURRED. BASED UPON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ANY SUCH LAWSUIT OR RELATED LAWSUITS

WOULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

GAIN CONTINGENCY

ON AUGUST 17, 2010, IN A REINSURANCE DISPUTE IN NEW YORK STATE COURT CAPTIONED

UNITED STATES FIDELITY &

GUARANTY COMPANY V. AMERICAN RE-INSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL.

, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR UNITED STATES FIDELITY AND GUARANTY COMPANY (USF&G), A SUBSIDIARY OF THE

COMPANY, AND DENIED SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR THE REINSURERS. THE COURT OF APPEALS LARGELY AFFIRMED THE ENTRY OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT, BUT REMANDED TWO DISCRETE ISSUES FOR TRIAL. THEREAFTER, THE REINSURERS

FILED A MOTION WITH THE TRIAL COURT TO CHANGE VENUE, AND THE TRIAL COURT DENIED THE MOTION.

ON

NOVEMBER 7, 2016, THE COMPANY AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT WITH ONE OF THE THREE DEFENDANTS THEN REMAINING IN THIS DISPUTE. THE COMPANY RECEIVED PAYMENT UNDER THE SETTLEMENT IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016 AND, AS A RESULT, RECOGNIZED A $126 MILLION PRE-TAX ($82 MILLION AFTER-TAX) GAIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN "OTHER REVENUES" IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE BALANCE RELATED TO THIS CASE WAS REDUCED FROM APPROXIMATELY $238 MILLION TO APPROXIMATELY $31 MILLION IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET.

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (EXCHANGE ACT)) THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY'S REPORTS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED,

SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S RULES AND FORMS, AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANY'S

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURES. ANY CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THE DESIRED CONTROL OBJECTIVES. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, HAS EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANY'S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. BASED UPON THAT EVALUATION, THE

COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANY'S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE

EFFECTIVE TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR OBJECTIVES AT THE REASONABLE ASSURANCE LEVEL.

IN

ADDITION, THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) THAT

OCCURRED DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THE

COMPANY REGULARLY SEEKS TO IDENTIFY, DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, SOME OF WHICH MAY AFFECT ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. THESE CHANGES MAY INCLUDE SUCH ACTIVITIES AS IMPLEMENTING NEW, MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEMS, UPDATING EXISTING SYSTEMS OR PLATFORMS, AUTOMATING MANUAL PROCESSES OR UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED

BY THIRD PARTIES. THESE SYSTEMS CHANGES ARE OFTEN PHASED IN OVER MULTIPLE PERIODS IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE IMPLEMENTATION RISK IN ANY ONE PERIOD, AND AS EACH CHANGE IS IMPLEMENTED THE COMPANY MONITORS

ITS EFFECTIVENESS AS PART OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE COMPANY'S

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF

THE COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED BY MANAGEMENT, ARE UNDER THE GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF

THE COMPANY'S AUDIT COMMITTEE.

THE

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.



PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS

OF THE COMPANY;



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT

HAS ASSESSED THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE STANDARD MEASURES ADOPTED BY MANAGEMENT IN MAKING ITS EVALUATION ARE

THE MEASURES IN THE

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

PUBLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION.

BASED

UPON ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND THAT THERE WERE NO

MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF THAT DATE.

KPMG LLP,

AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, WHICH HAS AUDITED AND REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-K, HAS ISSUED

ITS REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WHICH FOLLOWS THIS REPORT.

265

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC..

WE

HAVE AUDITED THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES' (THE COMPANY) INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION

(COSO). THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT'S

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO

OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR

AUDIT ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN

OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE

ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OF THE TRAVELERS

COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, AND CASH

FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 16, 2017 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.
