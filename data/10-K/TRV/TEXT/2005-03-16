s   the st. paul
travelers companies, inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the company) is a holding company principally engaged, through its subsidiaries, in providing a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products
and services to businesses, government units, associations and individuals. it also has a presence in the asset management industry through its 79% majority ownership of nuveen investments, inc. (nuveen investments). the company, known as the st.
paul companies, inc. (spc) prior to its merger with travelers property casualty corp. (tpc), is incorporated as a general business corporation under the laws of the state of minnesota and is one of the oldest insurance organizations in the united
states, dating back to 1853. the principal executive offices of the company are located at 385 washington street, st. paul, minnesota 55102, and the telephone number is (651) 310-7911.   on april 1, 2004, tpc merged with a subsidiary of spc, as a result of which tpc became a wholly-owned subsidiary of spc, and
spc changed its name to the st. paul travelers companies, inc. for accounting purposes, this transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with tpc treated as the accounting acquirer. accordingly, this transaction was accounted for as a
purchase business combination, using tpcs historical financial information and applying fair value estimates to the acquired assets, liabilities and commitments of spc as of april 1, 2004. beginning on april 1, 2004, the results of operations
and financial condition of spc were consolidated with tpcs results of operations and financial condition. accordingly, all financial information presented herein for the twelve months ended december 31, 2004 reflects the accounts of tpc for
the three months ended march 31, 2004 and the consolidated accounts of spc and tpc for the nine months ended december 31, 2004. the financial information presented herein for the prior year periods reflects the accounts of tpc. in connection with
the merger, each issued and outstanding share of tpc class a and class b common stock (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights) was exchanged for 0.4334 of a share of the companys common stock. all share and per share amounts
for all prior periods have been restated to reflect the exchange of tpcs common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for the companys common stock without designated par value, except with regard to share information related to the tpc
initial public offering in 2002.   tpc is a connecticut
corporation that was formed in 1979 and, prior to its march 2002 initial public offering of class a common stock (ipo), was an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of citigroup inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, citigroup). tpc was
reorganized in connection with its ipo in march 2002. pursuant to the reorganization, which was completed on march 19, 2002, tpcs consolidated financial statements were adjusted to exclude the accounts of certain formerly wholly-owned tpc
subsidiaries, principally the travelers insurance company and its subsidiaries (being the former u.s. life insurance operations of tpc), certain other wholly-owned non-insurance subsidiaries of tpc and substantially all of tpcs assets and
certain liabilities not related to the property casualty insurance business.   in the ipo, on march 21, 2002, tpc issued 231 million shares* of its class a common stock, representing approximately 23% of tpcs common equity. after the ipo, citigroup inc. beneficially owned all of the 500
million shares* of tpcs outstanding class b common stock, each share of which was entitled to seven votes, and 269 million shares* of tpcs class a common stock, each share of which was entitled to one vote, representing at the time 94%
of the combined voting power of all classes of tpcs voting securities and 77% of the equity interest in tpc. on august 20, 2002, citigroup made a tax-free distribution to its stockholders (the citigroup distribution), of a portion of its
ownership interest in tpc, which, together with the shares issued in the ipo, represented more than 90% of tpcs common equity and more than 90% of the combined voting power of tpcs outstanding voting securities. citigroup received a
private letter ruling from the internal revenue service that the citigroup distribution was tax-free to citigroup, its stockholders and tpc. as part of the ruling

process, citigroup agreed to vote the shares it continued to hold of tpc following the citigroup distribution pro rata with the shares held by the public and
to divest the remaining shares it holds within five years following the citigroup distribution. after the merger, this undertaking also applies to shares of company common stock.   at december 31, 2004, citigroup held for its own account 6.50% of the companys outstanding common stock. at december
31, 2003 and 2002, citigroup held for its own account 9.87% and 9.95%, respectively, of tpcs common equity and 9.87% and 9.98%, respectively, of the combined voting power of tpcs outstanding voting securities.   the following discussion of the companys business is organized as
follows: (i) a description of each of the companys four business segments (commercial, specialty, personal, collectively comprising the companys property-casualty insurance operations, and asset management) and related services; (ii) a
description of interest expense and other; and (iii) certain other information.   property-casualty insurance operations   commercial

liability. national accounts also includes the companys residual market business, which primarily offers workers compensation products and services to the involuntary market.   commercial also includes the special liability group (which manages the
companys asbestos and environmental liabilities); the reinsurance, health care, and certain international runoff operations; and policies written by the companys subsidiary gulf insurance company (gulf), which was placed into runoff
during the second quarter of the year. these operations are collectively referred to as commercial other.

many national accounts
customers require insurance-related services in addition to or in lieu of pure risk coverage, primarily for workers compensation and, to a lesser extent, general liability and commercial automobile exposures. these types of services include
risk management services, such as claims administration, loss control and risk management information services, and are generally offered in connection with large deductible or self-insured programs. these services generate fee income rather than
net written premiums.   principal markets and methods of distribution
the commercial segment distributes its products through
approximately 6,200 independent agencies and brokers located throughout the united states that are serviced by approximately 100 field offices and three customer service centers. in recent years, the commercial segment, particularly in its select
accounts operation, has made significant investments in enhanced technology utilizing internet-based applications to provide real-time interface capabilities with its independent agencies and brokers. commercial builds relationships with
well-established, independent insurance agencies and brokers. in selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products, commercial considers each agencys or brokers profitability, financial stability, staff experience
and strategic fit with its operating and marketing plans. once an agency or broker is appointed, commercial carefully monitors its performance.   commercial accounts sells a broad range of property and casualty insurance products through a large network of independent agents and brokers.
commercial accounts casualty products primarily target mid-sized businesses with 75 to 1,000 employees, while its property products target large, mid-sized and small businesses. the company offers a full line of products to its commercial
accounts customers with an emphasis on guaranteed cost programs.   a key objective of commercial accounts is continued focus on first party product lines of business, which cover risks of loss to property of the insured. beyond the traditional middle market network, dedicated
table of contents
index to financial statements
underwriting units exist to complement the middle market or specifically respond to the unique or unusual business client insurance needs. these units are as
follows:
national property provides insurance coverage for large commercial property schedules and mid-sized risks covering losses on buildings, business assets and business interruption
exposures.
transportation provides auto liability, damage coverage, cargo and general liability coverages to the trucking industry. products have been developed for non-fleet (generally 1-10
units) and fleet (11+ units) customers and are distributed through general agents.
boiler and machinery provides comprehensive breakdown coverages for equipment including property and business income coverages. through the boilerre unit, boiler and machinery also
provides reinsurance, underwriting, engineering, claim handling and risk management services to other property casualty carriers that do not have in-house expertise.
inland marine provides insurance which generally covers articles that may be transported from one place to another, goods in transit other than transoceanic and movable objects.
coverages include builders risk, contractors equipment, fine arts, jewelers, motor truck cargo and transportation risks.
agribusiness offers property and liability coverages other than workers compensation for farms, ranches and larger commercial growers of agricultural products.
excess and surplus coverages are written on a non-admitted basis through established wholesalers. coverages typically underwritten include commercial auto and general liability.
national programs offers tailored insurance products to commercial insureds with similar risk characteristics, underwritten on a program basis. programs are typically marketed
through a single distribution channel. the targeted industries include entertainment, leisure, service, retail and sports.   select accounts is a leading provider of property casualty products to small businesses. it generally serves firms with one to 75 employees and
generally less complex exposures. products offered by select accounts are guaranteed cost policies, often a packaged product covering property and liability exposures. products are sold through independent agents and brokers, who are often the same
agents and brokers that sell the companys commercial accounts, specialty and personal products. in addition to the traditional small commercial agency network, select accounts has a dedicated servicing unit that serves unique customer needs,
including small national programs, architects and engineers, and emerging distribution markets.   select accounts offers its independent agents a system for small businesses that helps them connect all aspects of sales and service through a
comprehensive service platform. components of the platform include agency automation capabilities and state-of-the-art service centers that function as an extension of an agencys customer service operations, both of which are highly utilized
by agencies. more than 89% of select accounts eligible business volume is processed by agencies using its automated issuance systems, which allow agents to quote and issue policies from agency offices. approximately 3,600 agencies have chosen
to take advantage of select accounts service centers, which offer agencies a wide range of services, including coverage and billing inquiries, policy changes, the assistance of licensed service professionals and extended hours of operations.
national accounts sells a variety of casualty products
and services to large companies. national accounts clients generally select loss-sensitive products in connection with a large deductible or self-insured program and, to a lesser extent, a retrospectively rated or a guaranteed cost insurance policy.
through a network of field offices, the companys underwriting specialists work closely with national and regional brokers to tailor insurance programs to meet clients needs. workers compensation accounted for approximately 76% of
sales to national accounts customers during 2004, based on direct written premiums and fees. national accounts generated $446 million of fee income in 2004, excluding residual market business discussed below.
table of contents
index to financial statements
national accounts also includes the companys commercial residual market business. the
companys commercial residual market business sells claims and policy management services to workers compensation and automobile assigned risk plans and to self-insurance pools throughout the united states. the company services
approximately 35% of the total workers compensation assigned risk market. the company is one of only two servicing carriers that operate nationally. assigned risk plan contracts generated approximately $212 million in fee income in 2004.
commercial other includes the special liability group
(which manages the companys asbestos and environmental liabilities); the reinsurance, health care, and certain international runoff operations; and gulf, which was placed into runoff during the second quarter of 2004. certain business
previously written by gulf is now being written in commercial accounts and in the companys specialty segment. gulf provided specialty coverages including management and professional liability, excess and surplus lines, environmental, umbrella
and fidelity. gulf also provided insurance products specifically designed for financial institutions, the entertainment industry and sports organizations.    pricing and underwriting   pricing levels for commercial property and casualty insurance products are generally developed based upon the frequency and severity of estimated losses,
the expenses of producing business and managing claims, and a reasonable allowance for profit. commercial has a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that emphasizes a profit-orientation rather than premium volume or market share.
commercial has developed an underwriting and pricing
methodology that incorporates underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product development disciplines for particular industries. this approach is designed to maintain high quality underwriting and pricing discipline. it utilizes proprietary
data gathered and analyzed with respect to its commercial business over many years. the underwriters and engineers use this information to assess and evaluate risks prior to quotation. this information provides specialized knowledge about specific
industry segments. this methodology enables commercial to streamline its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters that will not compromise commercials underwriting integrity.   for smaller businesses, select accounts uses a process based on industry
classifications to allow agents and field underwriting representatives to make underwriting and pricing decisions within predetermined classifications, because underwriting criteria and pricing tend to be more standardized for these smaller
exposures.   a significant portion of commercial business is
written with large deductible insurance policies. under some workers compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, the company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. the company is subsequently reimbursed
by the contractholder for the deductible amount, and is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. at december 31, 2004, contractholder receivables and payables on unpaid losses associated with large deductible policies were each
approximately $4.21 billion. retrospectively rated policies are also used for workers compensation coverage. although the retrospectively rated feature of the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the company, it does introduce
credit risk to the company. receivables on unpaid losses from holders of retrospectively rated policies totaled approximately $267 million at december 31, 2004. significant collateral, primarily letters of credit and, to a lesser extent cash
collateral and surety bonds, is generally requested for large deductible plans and/or retrospectively rated policies that provide for deferred collection of deductible recoveries and/or ultimate premiums. the amount of collateral requested is
predicated upon the creditworthiness of the customer and the nature of the insured risks. commercial continually monitors the credit exposure on individual accounts and the adequacy of collateral.   the company continually monitors its exposure to natural and manmade peril
catastrophic losses and attempts to mitigate such exposure. the company uses sophisticated computer modeling techniques to analyze

underwriting risks of business in hurricane-prone, earthquake-prone and target risk areas. the company relies upon this analysis to make underwriting
decisions designed to manage its exposure on catastrophe-exposed business. see reinsurance.   product lines   commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage. property insurance covers damages such as those caused by fire, wind, hail, water, theft and vandalism, and protects businesses from financial loss due
to business interruption resulting from a covered loss. liability coverage insures businesses against third parties from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations, such as injuries sustained from products sold.
workers compensation provides coverage for
employers for specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to employees. there are typically four types of benefits payable under workers compensation policies: medical benefits, disability benefits, death
benefits and vocational rehabilitation benefits. the company emphasizes managed care cost containment strategies, which involve employers, employees and care providers in a cooperative effort that focuses on the injured employees early return
to work, cost-effective quality care, and customer service in this market. the company offers the following three types of workers compensation products:
guaranteed cost insurance products, in which policy premium charges are fixed for the period of coverage and do not vary as a result of the insureds loss experience;
loss-sensitive insurance products, including large deductible and retrospectively rated policies, in which fees or premiums are adjusted based on actual loss experience of the
insured during the policy period; and
service programs, which are generally sold to the companys national accounts customers, where the company receives fees rather than premiums for providing loss prevention,
risk management, and claim and benefit administration services to organizations under service agreements. the company also participates in state assigned risk pools as a servicing carrier and pool participant.   commercial automobile provides coverage for businesses against losses
incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties, property damage to an insureds vehicle, and property damage to other vehicles and other property resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks
in a business.   property provides coverage for loss or
damage to buildings, inventory and equipment from natural disasters, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, and severe winter weather. also covered are manmade events such as theft, vandalism, fires, explosions, terrorism and financial
loss due to business interruption resulting from covered property damage. for additional information on terrorism coverages, see terrorism risk insurance act of 2002. property also includes specialized equipment insurance, which
provides coverage for loss or damage resulting from the mechanical breakdown of boilers and machinery, and ocean and inland marine, which provides coverage for goods in transit and unique, one-of-a-kind exposures.   general liability provides coverage for liability exposures including
bodily injury and property damage arising from products sold and general business operations. specialized liability policies may also include coverage for directors and officers liability arising in their official capacities, employment
practices liability insurance, fiduciary liability for trustees and sponsors of pension, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans, errors and omissions insurance for employees, agents, professionals and others arising from acts or
failures to act under specified circumstances, as well as umbrella and excess insurance. errors and omissions insurance for professionals (such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and other health care providers) is sometimes also known as professional
liability insurance.

property, commercial auto and general liability.
umbrella/excess and surplus group, which consists of two distinct business units:
(a)
specialty excess and umbrella (seu) focuses on umbrella and excess liability business for retail agents and brokers, where other insurance companies are providing the primary
coverage. this group also provides coverages in the case where other company business groups prefer to outsource the underwriting of umbrella and excess business based on the expertise and/or limit capacity of seu. the coverages underwritten are
typically commercial auto, general liability and product liability. umbrella coverage may also be underwritten over a company that retains risk or has a self-insured retention, instead of a scheduled underlying policy.
(b)
excess & surplus lines (e&s lines) offers mono-line umbrella and excess coverage where the company does not write the primary casualty coverage, or where other
business groups within the company prefer to outsource the underwriting of umbrella and excess business based on the expertise and/or limit capacity of e&s lines. business is written on a non-admitted basis through established wholesalers. the
coverages typically underwritten include commercial auto, general liability and product liability.
discover re principally provides commercial auto liability, general liability, workers compensation and property coverages. it serves retail brokers and insureds that

texas and florida. as with the companys commercial catastrophe risk coverages underwritten in the commercial segment, a single loss event

specialtys international operations are located
in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of ireland, where it offers specialized insurance and risk management services to several specialty customer groups, including those in the technology, public services, and financial and professional
services industry sectors. the companys international operations primarily underwrite employers liability (similar to workers compensation coverage in the united states), public and product liability (the equivalent of general
liability), professional indemnity (similar to directors and officers or errors and omissions coverage), motor (similar to automobile coverage in the united states) and property.   the global underwriting business group underwrites home-foreign business, representing coverage for a
u.s. organizations property-liability exposures in a foreign country, and reverse-flow business, which involves coverage of a foreign organizations property or liability exposures located in the united states, as part of a
global program.   at lloyds, specialty underwrites
four principal lines of businessaviation, marine, global property and personal linesthrough syndicate 5000, for which the company provides 100% of the capital. during the second half of 2004, the company made a decision to exit certain

has made significant investments in enhanced technology utilizing internet-based applications to provide real-time interface capabilities with its independent agencies and brokers. specialty builds relationships with well-established, independent
insurance agencies and brokers. in selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products, specialty considers each agencys or brokers profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic fit with its
operating and marketing plans. once an agency or broker is appointed, specialty carefully monitors its performance.   specialty also distributes property and casualty products through selected wholesalers using surplus lines paper, both on a brokerage and managing general
underwriting basis. wholesalers are used because they serve certain markets that are not typically served by our appointed retail agents. the wholesale surplus lines market allows for more flexibility to write certain classes of business due to the
absence of rate and form regulation for surplus lines business. in working with wholesalers on a brokerage basis, specialty underwrites the business and sets the premium level. in working with wholesalers on a managing general underwriting (mgu)
basis, the mgus produce and underwrite business that conforms to specialtys underwriting guidelines that have been specifically designed for each facility.   specialty distributes its specialty products internationally through brokers in the domestic markets of each of the three
countries in which it operates, the united kingdom, canada and the republic of ireland. specialty also writes business at lloyds, where its products are distributed through lloyds accredited brokers and, by virtue of lloyds
worldwide licenses, specialty has access to international markets across the world.   pricing and underwriting   pricing levels for
specialty property and casualty insurance products are generally developed based upon the frequency and severity of estimated losses, the expenses of producing business and managing claims, and a reasonable allowance for profit. specialty has a
disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that emphasizes profit orientation rather than premium volume or market share.   specialty has developed an underwriting and pricing methodology that incorporates dedicated underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product
development disciplines for particular industries. this approach is designed to maintain high quality underwriting and pricing discipline, based on an in-depth knowledge of the specific industry. the underwriters and engineers use proprietary data
gathered and analyzed over many years to assess and evaluate risks prior to quotation, and then use the more than 4,000 proprietary forms to tailor insurance coverage to target markets. this methodology enables specialty to streamline its risk
selection process and develop pricing parameters that will not compromise its underwriting integrity.   a portion of specialty business is written with large deductible insurance policies. under some workers compensation insurance contracts with
deductible features, specialty is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. specialty is subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount and is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. at
december 31, 2004, contractholder receivables and payables on unpaid losses associated with large deductible policies were each approximately $1.41 billion. significant collateral, primarily letters of credit and, to a lesser extent surety bonds and
cash collateral, is generally requested for large deductible plans that provide for deferred collection of deductibles. the amount of collateral requested is predicated upon the creditworthiness of the customer and the nature of the insured risks.
specialty continually monitors the credit exposure and the adequacy of collateral.   product lines   general liability
provides coverage for liability exposures including bodily injury and property damage arising from products sold and general business operations. specialized liability policies may also include
table of contents
index to financial statements
coverage for directors and officers liability arising in their official capacities, employment practices liability insurance, fiduciary liability
for trustees and sponsors of pension, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans, errors and omissions insurance for employees, agents, professionals and others arising from acts or failures to act under specified circumstances, as well as
umbrella and excess insurance. errors and omissions insurance for professionals (such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and other health care providers) is sometimes also known as professional liability insurance.   fidelity and surety provides fidelity insurance coverage, which
protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee, and surety, which is a three-party agreement whereby the insurer agrees to pay a third party or make complete an obligation in response to the default,
acts or omissions of an insured. surety is generally provided for construction performance, legal matters such as appeals, trustees in bankruptcy and probate and other performance bonds. this product line includes surety business written in the
companys st. paul guarantee (canada) and afianzadora insurgentes (mexico) subsidiaries.   workers compensation provides coverage for employers for specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to employees. there are typically four types of benefits payable under
workers compensation policies: medical benefits, disability benefits, death benefits and vocational rehabilitation benefits. the company emphasizes managed care cost containment strategies, which involve employers, employees and care providers
in a cooperative effort that focuses on the injured employees early return to work, cost-effective, quality care and customer service in this market.   commercial automobile provides coverage for businesses against losses incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties,
property damage to an insureds vehicle, and property damage to other vehicles and other property resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks in a business.   property provides coverage for loss or damage to buildings, inventory
and equipment from natural disasters, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, and severe winter weather. also covered are manmade events such as theft, vandalism, fires, explosions, terrorism and financial loss due to business
interruption resulting from covered property damage. for additional information on terrorism coverages, see reinsuranceterrorism risk insurance act of 2002. property also includes specialized equipment insurance, which provides
coverage for loss or damage resulting from the mechanical breakdown of boilers and machinery, and ocean and inland marine insurance, which provides coverage for goods in transit, and unique one-of-a-kind exposures.   commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and
liability coverage. property insurance covers damages such as those caused by fire, wind, hail, water, theft and vandalism, and protects businesses from financial loss due to business interruption resulting from a covered loss. liability coverage
insures businesses against third parties from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations, such as injuries sustained from products sold.   international provides coverage through non-u.s. insurance markets, predominantly through operations in the united
kingdom, canada, the republic of ireland and at lloyds. the coverage provided in those markets includes employers liability (similar to workers compensation coverage in the united states), public and product liability (the
equivalent of general liability), professional indemnity (similar to directors and officers or errors and omissions coverages), motor (similar to automobile coverage in the united states) and property. while the covered hazard may be similar to
those in the u.s. market, the different legal environments can make the product risks and coverage terms potentially very different from those in the united states. international does not include surety business written in the companys st.
paul guarantee and afianzadora insurgentes subsidiaries.

principal markets and methods of
distribution   personal products are distributed primarily
through approximately 7,500 independent agencies located throughout the united states, supported by personnel in ten marketing regions, three single state companies and six business service centers. in selecting new independent agencies to
distribute its products, personal considers each agencys profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic fit with personals operating and marketing plans. once an agency is appointed, personal carefully monitors its
performance. while the principal markets for personals insurance products are in states along the east coast, in the south and texas, personal is expanding its geographical presence across the united states.

personal operates single state companies in massachusetts, new jersey and florida with products marketed
primarily through independent agents. these states represented approximately 20% of personal direct written premiums in 2004. the companies were established to manage complex markets in massachusetts and new jersey and property catastrophe exposure
in florida. each company has dedicated resources in underwriting, claim, finance, legal and service functions.   personal uses a consistent operating model with agents outside of the single state companies (see discussion above). the model provides technological
alternatives to agents to maximize their ease of doing business. personal agents quote and issue approximately 97% of personals policies directly from their agencies by leveraging either their own agency management system or using
personals proprietary quote and issuance systems which allows agents to rate, quote and issue policies on line. all of these quote and issue platforms interface with the personals underwriting and rating systems, which edit transactions
for compliance with personals underwriting and pricing programs. business processed by agents on these platforms is subjected to consultative review by personals in-house underwriters. in the past year, personal continued to increase use
of internet-based proprietary systems, and agents have transitioned approximately 96% of personals new business to these platforms. personal also provides a download capability that refreshes the individual agency system databases of
approximately 4,100 agents each day with updated policy information.   personal continues to develop functionality to provide its agents with a comprehensive array of online service capabilities packaged together in an easy-to-use agency service portal, including customer service, marketing and claim
functionality. agencies can also choose to shift the ongoing core service responsibility for personals customers to one of the companys four customer care centers, where the company functions as an extension of an agencys servicing
operation by providing a comprehensive array of direct customer service needs, including response to billing and coverage inquiries, and policy changes. approximately 1,100 agents take advantage of this service alternative.   personal also markets through additional distribution channels, including
sponsoring organizations such as employers and consumer associations, and joint marketing arrangements with other insurers. personal handles the sales and service for these programs either through a sponsoring independent agent or through two of the
companys call center locations. the company is one of the leading providers of personal lines products to members of affinity groups. a number of well-known corporations endorse the companys product offerings to their employees primarily
through a payroll deduction payment process. the company has significant relationships with the majority of the american automobile association (aaa) clubs in the united states and other affinity groups that endorse personals tailored
offerings to their members. since 1995, the company has had a marketing agreement with geico to receive referrals for homeowners business. this agreement has added profitable business and helped to geographically diversify the homeowners line of
business.   pricing and underwriting   pricing levels for personal property and casualty insurance products are
generally developed based upon the frequency and severity of incurred losses and loss adjustment expense, the expenses of producing business and a reasonable allowance for profit and contingencies. the company has a disciplined approach to
underwriting and risk management that places emphasis on underwriting profit rather than market share.   personal has developed a product management methodology that integrates the disciplines of underwriting, claim, actuarial and product development. this
approach is designed to maintain high quality underwriting discipline and pricing segmentation. proprietary data is analyzed with respect to personals business over many years. personal uses a variety of proprietary and vendor produced risk
differentiation models to facilitate its pricing segmentation. personals product managers establish strict underwriting guidelines integrated with its filed pricing and rating plans, which enable personal to streamline its risk selection and
pricing processes.   pricing for personal automobile insurance
is driven by changes in the frequency of claims and by inflation in the cost of automobile repairs, medical care and litigation of liability claims. as a result, the profitability of the
table of contents
index to financial statements
business is largely dependent on promptly identifying and rectifying disparities between premium levels and projected claim costs, and obtaining approval
from state regulatory authorities when necessary for filed rate changes.   pricing in the homeowners business is also driven by changes in the frequency of claims and by inflation in the cost of building supplies, labor and household possessions. most homeowners policies offer, but do not
require, automatic increases in coverage to reflect growth in replacement costs and property values. in addition to the normal risks associated with any multiple peril coverage, the profitability and pricing of homeowners insurance is affected by
the incidence of natural disasters, particularly hurricanes, winter storms, wind and hail, water damage, earthquakes and tornadoes. in order to reduce the companys exposure to catastrophe losses, personal has limited the writing of new
homeowners business and selectively non-renewed existing homeowners business in some markets. in addition, underwriting standards have been tightened, price increases have been implemented in some catastrophe-prone areas, and deductibles have been
put in place in hurricane and wind and hail prone areas. personal uses computer-modeling techniques to assess its level of exposure to loss in hurricane and earthquake catastrophe-prone areas. changes to methods of marketing and underwriting in some
jurisdictions are subject to state-imposed restrictions, which can make it more difficult for an insurer to significantly reduce catastrophe exposures.   insurers writing personal lines property casualty policies may be unable to increase prices until some time after the costs associated with coverage have
increased, primarily because of state insurance rate regulation. the pace at which an insurer can change rates in response to increased costs depends, in part, on whether the applicable state law requires prior approval of rate increases or
notification to the regulator either before or after a rate change is imposed. in states with prior approval laws, rates must be approved by the regulator before being used by the insurer. in states having file-and-use laws, the insurer
must file rate changes with the regulator, but does not need to wait for approval before using the new rates. a use-and-file law requires an insurer to file rates within a period of time after the insurer begins using the new rate.
approximately one-half of the states require prior approval of most rate changes.   independent agents either submit applications to the companys service centers for underwriting review, quote, and issuance or they utilize one of its automated quote and issue systems. automated transactions are
edited by the companys systems and issued if they conform to established guidelines. exceptions are reviewed by underwriters in the companys business centers or by agency managers. audits are conducted by business center underwriters and
agency managers, on a systematic sampling basis, across all of the companys independent agency generated business. each agent is assigned to a specific employee or team of employees responsible for working with the agent on business plan
development, marketing, and overall growth and profitability. the company uses agency level management information to analyze and understand results and to identify problems and opportunities.   the personal products sold through additional marketing channels are
underwritten by the companys employees. underwriters work with the company management on business plan development, marketing, and overall growth and profitability. channel-specific production and claim information is used to analyze results
and identify problems and opportunities.   product lines   the primary coverages in personal are personal automobile and homeowners
insurance sold to individuals. personal had approximately 6.1 million policies in force at december 31, 2004.   personal automobile provides coverage for liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage and for physical damage to an
insureds own vehicle from collision and various other perils. in addition, many states require policies to provide first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.   homeowners and other provides protection against losses to
dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils, as well as coverage for liability arising from ownership or occupancy. the company writes

homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and rental property contents. the company also writes coverage for personal watercraft, personal articles
such as jewelry, and umbrella liability protection.   geographic distribution

no other single state accounted for 3.0% or more of the total direct written premiums written in 2004 by the company.   asset management   nuveen investments, inc. is the companys asset management subsidiary. the company held a 79% interest in nuveen
investments at december 31, 2004.   nuveen investments
core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high-net-worth and institutional market segments. nuveen investments distributes
its investment products and services, including individually managed accounts, closed-end exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, to the affluent and high-net-worth market segments through unaffiliated intermediary firms including broker/dealers,
commercial banks, affiliates of insurance providers, financial planners, accountants, consultants and investment advisors. nuveen investments also provides managed account services to several institutional market segments and channels. nuveen
investments markets its capabilities under four distinct brands: rittenhouse (blue-chip growth-style equities); nwq (value-style equities); nuveen (fixed-income investments); and symphony (an institutional
manager of market-neutral alternative investment portfolios). nuveen investments is listed on the new york stock exchange, trading under the symbol jnc.   nuveen investments primary business activities generate three principal sources of revenue: (1) advisory fees earned
on assets under management, including exchange-traded funds, separately managed accounts and mutual funds; (2) underwriting and distribution revenues earned upon the sale of certain investment products; and (3) performance fees earned on certain
institutional accounts based on the performance of such accounts. advisory fees accounted for 93% of nuveen investments total revenues in 2004.   operations of nuveen investments are organized around its principal advisory subsidiaries, which are registered investment advisors under the investment
advisers act of 1940. certain of these advisory subsidiaries

manage the mutual funds and exchange-traded funds of nuveen investments, and others provide investment services for individual and institutional managed
accounts. additionally, nuveen investments, llc, a registered broker and dealer in securities under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, provides investment product distribution and related services for the companys managed funds,
and, through march 2002, sponsored and distributed the companys defined portfolios (unit investment trusts).   at december 31, 2004, nuveen investments assets under management totaled $115.45 billion, consisting of $50.21 billion of exchange-traded funds,
$36.98 billion of retail managed accounts, $15.58 billion of institutional managed accounts and $12.68 billion of mutual funds.   on january 31, 2005, the company announced its intention to explore alternatives for divestiture of ownership of its 79% share of nuveen investments. the
proposed divestiture reflects the companys strategic decision to focus on its property-casualty business. the company anticipates a sale within twelve months.   on march 3, 2005, nuveen investments filed a registration statement on form s-3 in conjunction with the companys
intention to explore its strategic alternatives with respect to its equity interest in nuveen investments, including a public offering or a sale to a third party.   claims management   the companys claims management strategy and its execution are critical to operating results and business retention. claim payout and expense
represent a substantial portion of every premium dollar the company earns. the companys claims management strategy is based on four core tenets:
fair, efficient, fact-based claims management controls losses for the company and its customers;
use of advanced technology provides front-line claims professionals with necessary information and facilitates prompt claim resolution;
specialization of claims professionals and segmentation of claims by complexity, as indicated by severity, coverage and causation, allow the company to focus its resources
effectively; and
excellent customer service enhances customer retention.   claim services employs a diverse group of professionals, including claim adjusters, appraisers, attorneys, investigators, system specialists and training,
management and support personnel. approved external service providers, such as independent adjusters and appraisers, investigators and attorneys, are available for use as appropriate.   field claim management teams located in 72 offices in 45 states are organized to maintain focus on the specific claim
characteristics unique to the businesses within the commercial, personal and specialty segments. claim teams with specialized skills, resources, and workflows are matched to the unique exposures of those businesses with local claim management
dedicated to achieving optimal results within each segment. the companys home office operations provide additional support in the form of workflow design, quality management, information technology, advanced management information and data
analysis, training, financial reporting and control, and human resources strategy. in addition to the field teams, claim staff is dedicated to each of personals single state companies in florida, massachusetts and new jersey. this structure
permits the company to maintain the economies of scale of a larger, established company while retaining the agility to respond promptly to the needs of customers, brokers, agents and underwriters.   an integral part of the companys strategy to benefit customers and
shareholders is its continuing leadership in the fight against insurance fraud.

claim services uses advanced technology, management information, and data analysis to assist the company
in reviewing its claim practices and results to evaluate and improve its performance. the companys claim management strategy is focused on segmentation of claims and appropriate technical specialization to drive effective claim resolution. the
company continually monitors its investment in claim resources to maintain an effective focus on claim outcomes. in recent years, the company has invested significant additional resources in its personal claim handling operations and expanded its
catastrophe response team. the company has embarked upon a series of process re-engineering pilots, in both auto and property. to the extent that those pilots show favorable results, the company would anticipate rolling them out more
broadly in 2005. the companys proven catastrophe response strategy and its catastrophe claim handling teams were instrumental in its response to a variety of weather-related losses that impacted the insurance industry in 2004, including
hurricanes charley, frances, ivan and jeanne, an unprecedented series of significant storms that struck the southeastern united states in the third quarter.   the company is a leading user of digital and wireless technology and browser-based claim processes. for example, travglasssm, the companys internet-based claims application, includes a network of pre-approved and customer or agent selected glass
repair providers and enables the company to effectively and efficiently meet its customers automobile glass repair needs.   another strategic advantage is travcompsm, a workers compensation claim resolution and medical management program that assists adjusters in the prompt investigation and effective management of workers compensation claims. innovative medical and claims
management technologies permit nurse, medical and claims professionals to share appropriate vital information that supports prompt investigation, effective return to work and claim resolution strategies. these technologies, together with effective
matching of professional skills and authority to specific claim issues, have resulted in more efficient management of workers compensation claims with lower medical, wage replacement costs and loss adjustment expenses.   reinsurance   the company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses and protect capital
resources. the company cedes to reinsurers a portion of these risks and pays premiums based upon the risk and exposure of the policies subject to such reinsurance. ceded reinsurance involves credit risk, except with regard to mandatory pools, and is
generally subject to aggregate loss limits. although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. reinsurance recoverables are reported after
reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts. the company also holds collateral, including trust agreements, escrow funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. the company monitors the
financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically. reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices and the price of their product offerings. for additional
information concerning reinsurance, see note 8 of notes to the companys consolidated financial statements.   the company utilizes a variety of reinsurance agreements to control its exposure to large property and casualty losses, including:
facultative reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for all or a portion of the insurance provided by a single policy and each policy reinsured is separately negotiated;
treaty reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for a specified type or category of risks; and
catastrophe reinsurance, in which the company is indemnified for an amount of loss in excess of a specified retention with respect to losses resulting from a catastrophic event.

as of december 31,
2004, the company had reinsurance recoverables from syndicates at lloyds of $738 million. in 1996, lloyds restructured its operations with respect to claims for years prior to 1993 and reinsured these into equitas limited, which is
currently unrated. approximately $90 million of the companys lloyds reinsurance recoverables at december 31, 2004 relates to equitas liabilities. the remaining recoverables of $648 million are from the continuing market of lloyds,
which is rated a (3rd highest of 16 ratings) by a.m. best. during the first quarter of 2004, tpc entered into an agreement to settle all current and future reinsurance claims against certain underwriters at lloyds reinsured by equitas. under
terms of this settlement, the company received $245 million, resolving approximately $255 million of tpcs net claim balances from equitas. virtually all of the $90 million reinsurance recoverables relating to equitas remaining at december 31,
2004 relate to spc.   at december 31, 2004, the company had
$19.05 billion in reinsurance recoverables. of this amount, $2.50 billion is for mandatory pools and associations that relate primarily to workers compensation service business and have the obligation of the participating insurance companies
on a joint and several basis supporting these cessions. an additional $3.94 billion of this amount is attributable to structured settlements relating primarily to personal injury claims, for which the company has purchased annuities and remains
contingently liable in the event of any defaults by the companies issuing the annuities. of the remaining $12.61 billion ceded to reinsurers at december 31, 2004, $1.50 billion is attributable to asbestos and environmental claims, and the remainder
principally reflects reinsurance in support of ongoing and runoff business. at december 31, 2004, $2.8 billion of reinsurance recoverables were collateralized by letters of credit, trust agreements and escrow funds. also at december 31, 2004, the
company had an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables of $751 million.   for a description of reinsurance related litigation, see item 3, legal proceedings.   current net retention policy   the descriptions below relate to the companys reinsurance arrangements in effect at january 1, 2005. most property and casualty reinsurance
agreements have terrorism sublimits or exclusions. the company does not purchase treaty reinsurance for losses arising from workers compensation policies. for third party liability, including automobile no-fault, the reinsurance agreement used
by commercial and specialty limits the net retention to a maximum of $8 million per insured, per occurrence. for third party liability, including but not limited to professional liability, directors and officers liability, and employment
practices liability, the reinsurance agreements used by specialty generally limit the net retentions from $4 million to $16 million per policy. for third party liability, national accounts limits its exposure by utilizing facultative reinsurance.
reinsurance is also used to limit the net retained amount per risk to $15 million for commercial and specialty property. for surety protection, the company generally retains up to $24.5 million probable maximum loss (pml) per principal but may
retain higher amounts based on the type of obligation, credit quality and other credit risk factors. personal retains the first $5 million of umbrella policies and purchases facultative reinsurance for limits over $5 million. for personal property
insurance, there is a $6 million maximum retention per risk. the company also utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. the company may also retain amounts greater
than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

catastrophe reinsurance
the company utilizes a reinsurance agreement with nonaffiliated reinsurers to control its exposure to losses resulting from one occurrence. for the
accumulation of net property losses arising out of one occurrence, the general catastrophe agreement covers 60% of total losses between $750 million and $2 billion. this agreement excludes nuclear, chemical and biochemical losses for domestic
terrorism and all terrorism losses as defined by the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002. this agreement covers all of the companys business except that business underwritten in the united kingdom and republic of ireland, and through the
companys lloyds operations, where separate catastrophe coverage is purchased locally and generally results in significantly lower net loss exposure levels than in the general catastrophe agreement. the company conducts an ongoing review
of its risk and catastrophe coverages and makes changes it deems appropriate.   terrorism risk insurance act of 2002   on
november 26, 2002, the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 (the terrorism act) was enacted into federal law and established the terrorism insurance program (the program), a temporary federal program in the department of the treasury, that provides
for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest. in order for a loss to be covered under the program (subject losses), the loss must be
the result of an event that is certified as an act of terrorism by the u.s. secretary of treasury. in the case of a war declared by congress, only workers compensation losses are covered by the terrorism act. the terrorism act generally
requires that all commercial property casualty insurers licensed in the united states participate in the program. the program terminates on december 31, 2005. under the program, a participating insurer is entitled to be reimbursed by the federal
government for 90% of subject losses, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap. in each case, the deductible percentage is applied to the insurers subject direct earned premiums from the calendar year immediately preceding the
applicable year. the deductible under the program was 7% for 2003, 10% for 2004 and is 15% for 2005. the program also contains an annual cap that limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100 billion. once
subject losses have reached the $100 billion aggregate during a program year, there is no additional reimbursement from the u.s. treasury and an insurer that has met its deductible for the program year is not liable for any losses (or portion
thereof) that exceed the $100 billion cap. the companys estimated deductible under this federal program is $2.51 billion for 2005. the company had no terrorism-related losses in 2004 or 2003. if the program is not renewed for periods after
january 1, 2006, the benefits of the program will not be available to the company, and the company will be subject to losses from acts of terrorism subject only to the terms and provisions of applicable policies.   florida reinsurance fund   the company also participates in the florida hurricane catastrophe fund
(fhcf), which is a state-mandated catastrophe reinsurance fund that will provide reimbursement to insurers for a portion of their future catastrophic hurricane losses. fhcf is primarily funded by premiums from insurance companies that write
residential property business in florida and, if insufficient, assessments on insurance companies that write other property and casualty insurance, excluding workers compensation and medical malpractice. fhcfs resources are limited to
these contributions and to its borrowing capacity at the time of a significant catastrophe in florida. in 2004, fhcf paid its obligations arising from the four hurricanes that made landfall in florida from the cash on hand derived from premium
payments. the company believes that fhcf resources will be at the statutory required capacity in 2005. there can be no assurance that these resources will be sufficient to meet the obligations of fhcf.   the companys recovery of less than contracted amounts from fhcf could
have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations in the event of a significant catastrophe in florida. however, the company believes that it is not likely that its recovery of less than contracted amounts from fhcf would
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or liquidity.

salvage and subrogation. the reserves are also reviewed regularly by a qualified actuary employed by the company. for additional information on the process of estimating reserves and a discussion of underlying variables and risk factors, see
item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimates.   the process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and requires the consideration of a number of variables. these variables
(discussed by product line in the previously mentioned critical accounting estimates section) are affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial trends and legislative
changes, among others. the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs of loss and loss adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in the underlying
insurance contract (e.g., claims made versus occurrence), claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, determining the occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the
insured event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). informed judgment is applied throughout the process.   the company derives estimates for unreported claims and development on reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of historical patterns of loss
development by accident year for each type of exposure and market segment. similarly, the company derives estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses principally from actuarial analyses of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss
adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business and type of exposure. for a description of the companys reserving methods for asbestos and environmental claims, see item 7asbestos claims and litigation, and
environmental claims and litigation.   discounting
included in the claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves in the consolidated balance sheet are certain reserves discounted to the present value of estimated future payments. the liabilities for losses for some long-term disability payments under workers compensation insurance and
workers compensation excess insurance, which totaled $2.06 billion and $1.33 billion at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, have been discounted using rates of 3.5% to 5.0%. reserves related to certain fixed and determinable
asbestos-related settlements, where all payment amounts and their timing are known, were discounted using a range of interest rates from 2.3% to 5.5% and totaled $48 million and $445 million at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. reserves for
certain assumed reinsurance coverage acquired in the merger, discounted using rates of 5.0% to 7.5%, were $116 million at december 31, 2004.   other factors   the table on page 22 sets forth the year-end reserves from 1994 through 2004 and the subsequent changes in those reserves, presented on a historical
basis. the original estimates, cumulative amounts paid and reestimated reserves in the table for the years 1994 through 2003 have not been restated to reflect the acquisition of spc in 2004. the table includes spc reserves at december 31, 2004.

guaranty casualty and of aetnas property and casualty insurance subsidiaries, respectively. beginning in 1996 and 2002, the table includes the reserve
activity of aetnas property and casualty insurance subsidiaries, and northland and commercial guaranty casualty, respectively. the data in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the securities and exchange
commission (sec). care must be taken to avoid misinterpretation by those unfamiliar with this information or familiar with other data commonly reported by the insurance industry. the accompanying data is not accident year data, but rather a display
of 1994 to 2004 year-end reserves and the subsequent changes in those reserves.   for instance, the cumulative deficiency or redundancy shown in the accompanying table for each year represents the aggregate amount by which original estimates of reserves as of that year end have changed
in subsequent years. accordingly, the cumulative deficiency for a year relates only to reserves at that year-end and those amounts are not additive. expressed another way, if the original reserves at the end of 1994 included $4 million for a loss
that is finally paid in 2004 for $5 million, the $1 million deficiency (the excess of the actual payment of $5 million over the original estimate of $4 million) would be included in the cumulative deficiencies in each of the years 1994 to 2003 shown
in the accompanying table.   various factors may distort the
re-estimated reserves and cumulative deficiency or redundancy shown in the accompanying table. for example, a substantial portion of the cumulative deficiencies shown in the accompanying table arise from claims on policies written prior to the
mid-1970s involving liability exposures such as asbestos and environmental claims. in the post-1984 period, the company has developed more stringent underwriting standards and policy exclusions and has significantly contracted or terminated the
writing of these risks. see item 7asbestos claims and litigation, and environmental claims and litigation. general conditions and trends that have affected the development of these liabilities in the past will not
necessarily recur in the future.   other factors that affect the
data in the accompanying table include the discounting of certain reserves, as discussed above, and the use of retrospectively rated insurance policies. for example, workers compensation indemnity reserves (tabular reserves) are discounted to
reflect the time value of money. apparent deficiencies will continue to occur as the discount on these workers compensation reserves is accreted at the appropriate interest rates. also, a portion of national accounts business is underwritten
with retrospectively rated insurance policies in which the ultimate loss experience is primarily borne by the insured. for this business, increases in loss experience result in an increase in reserves and an offsetting increase in amounts
recoverable from insureds. likewise, decreases in loss experience result in a decrease in reserves and an offsetting decrease in amounts recoverable from these insureds. the amounts recoverable on these retrospectively rated policies mitigate the
impact of the cumulative deficiencies or redundancies on the companys earnings but are not reflected in the accompanying table.   because of these and other factors, it is difficult to develop a meaningful extrapolation of estimated future redundancies or deficiencies in loss
reserves from the data in the accompanying table.   the
differences between the reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses shown in the accompanying table, which is prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and those reported in the
companys annual reports filed with insurance regulators, which are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices, were $(282) million, $26 million and $(12) million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the increase in the
difference from 2003 to 2004 was primarily driven by the impact of a reinsurance contract which the company entered into in 2004 that provides coverage for prior accident years.

asbestos and environmental claims   asbestos and environmental claims are segregated from other claims and are handled separately by the companys special
liability group, a separate unit staffed by dedicated legal, claim, finance and engineering professionals. for additional information on asbestos and environmental claims, see item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial
conditions and results of operations.   intercompany reinsurance
most of the companys insurance subsidiaries are
members of intercompany property and casualty reinsurance pooling arrangements. pooling arrangements permit the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pools capital and surplus rather than just on its own capital and
surplus. under such arrangements, the members share substantially all insurance business that is written, and allocate the combined premiums, losses and expenses. as of december 31, 2004, there were three intercompany pooling arrangements: the
travelers property casualty pool, the st. paul insurance group pool, which was acquired in the merger, and the northland pool. pools permit the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pools capital and surplus rather than
just on its own capital and surplus. travelers casualty and surety company of america (travelers c&s of america), which is dedicated to the bond business, does not participate in any of the pools. the personal single state companies and
commercial guaranty casualty insurance company (see ratings below) are also not included in any of the pools. in 2004, the former gulf intercompany pooling arrangement was amended, thereby eliminating gulf insurance companys retrocession to
the other former pool participants.   ratings   ratings are an important factor in setting the companys competitive
position in the insurance marketplace. the company receives ratings from the following major rating agencies: a.m. best company (a.m. best), fitch ratings (fitch), moodys investors service (moodys) and standard & poors corp.
(s&p). rating agencies typically issue two types of ratings: claims-paying (or financial strength) ratings which assess an insurers ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders and debt ratings which assess a companys
prospects for repaying its debts and assist lenders in setting interest rates and terms for a companys short and long term borrowing needs. the system and the number of rating categories can vary widely from rating agency to rating agency.
customers usually focus on claims-paying ratings, while creditors focus on debt ratings. investors use both to evaluate a companys overall financial strength. the ratings issued on the company or its subsidiaries by any of these agencies are
announced publicly and are available on the companys website and from the agencies.   the companys insurance operations could be negatively impacted by a downgrade in one or more of the companys financial strength ratings. if this were to occur, there could be a reduced demand for certain
products in certain markets. additionally, the companys ability to access the capital markets could be impacted and higher borrowing costs may be incurred.   in january 2004, a.m. best placed the a financial strength rating of gulf, a then majority-owned subsidiary of
the company, under review with developing implications, and s&p indicated that its a+ counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on members of the gulf insurance group are remaining on creditwatch with negative implications, pending the
completion of a support arrangement between the travelers indemnity company and gulf.   also in january 2004, a.m. best downgraded the financial strength rating of the northland pool from a+ to a, removed the rating from under review and assigned a stable outlook.

company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments. in general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate
bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications.   at december 31, 2004, the carrying value of the companys investment portfolio was $64.71 billion, of which 92% was
invested in fixed maturity investments and short-term investments (of which 55% was invested in federal, state or municipal government obligations), 1% in mortgage loans and real estate, 1% in common stocks and other equity securities and 6% in
other investments. the average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, was 4.1 years at december 31, 2004. non-investment grade securities totaled approximately $1.78 billion, representing approximately 3% of the
companys fixed maturity investment portfolio as of december 31, 2004.   the following table sets forth information regarding the companys investments. it reflects the average amount of investments, net investment income earned and the yield thereon. see note 6 of notes to the

the property and casualty insurance industry is highly
competitive in the areas of price, service, product offerings, agent relationships and method of distribution, i.e., use of independent agents, exclusive agents and/or salaried employees. according to a.m. best, there are approximately 950 property
casualty organizations in the united states, comprising approximately 2,400 property casualty companies. of those organizations, the top 150 accounted for approximately 92% of the consolidated industrys total net written premiums in 2003.
several property and casualty insurers writing commercial lines of business, including the company, offer products for alternative forms of risk protection in addition to traditional insurance products. these products, including large deductible
programs and various forms of self-insurance that utilize captive insurance companies and risk retention groups, have been instituted in reaction to the escalating cost of insurance caused in part by increased costs from workers compensation
cases and jury awards in third-party liability cases.

commercial. the insurance industry is represented in the commercial lines marketplace by many
insurance companies of varying size as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions or captive programs. market competition works within the insurance regulatory framework to set the price charged for insurance
products and the level of service provided. growth is driven by a companys ability to provide insurance and services at a price that is reasonable and acceptable to the customer. in addition, the marketplace is affected by available capacity
of the insurance industry as measured by policyholders surplus and the availability of reinsurance. surplus expands and contracts primarily in conjunction with profit levels generated by the industry. growth in premium and service business is
also measured by a companys ability to retain existing customers and to attract new customers. additionally, many large commercial customers self-insure their risks or utilize large deductibles on purchased insurance.   commercial accounts business has historically been written through
independent agents and brokers, although some companies use direct writing. competitors in this market are primarily national property casualty insurance companies willing to write most classes of business using traditional products and pricing and,
to a lesser extent, regional insurance companies and companies that have developed niche programs for specific industry segments. companies compete on price, product offerings, response time in policy issuance and claim and loss prevention services.
additionally, improved efficiency through automation and response time to customer needs are key to success in this market. the commercial segment also utilizes dedicated units to tailor insurance programs to unique insurance needs. these units are
national property, transportation, boiler and machinery, inland marine, agribusiness, excess and surplus and national programs.   select accounts business is typically written through independent agents and, to a lesser extent, regional brokers. both national and regional property
casualty insurance companies compete in the select accounts market which generally comprises lower hazard, main street business customers. risks are underwritten and priced using standard industry practices and a combination of
proprietary and standard industry product offerings. competition in this market is primarily based on price, product offerings and response time in policy services. the commercial segment has established a strong marketing relationship with its
distribution network and has provided it with defined underwriting policies, a broad array of products, competitive prices and one of the most efficient automated environments in the industry. in addition, the company has established centralized
service centers to help agents perform many service functions, in return for a fee. commercials overall service platform is one of the strongest in the small business commercial market.   national accounts business is typically written through national brokers and,
to a lesser extent, regional brokers. insurance companies compete in this market based on price, product offerings, claim and loss prevention services, managed care cost containment and risk management information systems. national accounts also
offers a large nationwide network of localized claim service centers which provide greater flexibility in claims adjusting and allows commercial to more quickly respond to the needs of its customers. commercials residual market business also
competes for state contracts to provide claims and policy management services. these contracts, which generally have three-year terms, are selected by state agencies through a bid process based on the quality of service and price. commercial
services approximately 35% of the total workers compensation assigned risk market, making the company one of the largest servicing insurers in the industry.   the market in which gulf competed included small to mid-size niche companies that target specific lines of insurance and
larger, multi-line companies that focus on various segments of the specialty accounts market. prior to being placed in runoff in 2004, gulfs business was generally written through retail and wholesale agents and brokers throughout the united
states.   specialty. the competitive landscape in which
the specialty segment operates is affected by many of the same factors described previously for the commercial segment. the companys domestic and international insurance subsidiaries compete with other stock companies, mutual companies,
alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. competitors in this market are primarily national property-liability insurance companies willing to write most classes of business using traditional products and pricing and, to a

lesser extent, regional insurance companies and companies that have developed niche programs for specific industry segments. in addition, many large
commercial customers self-insure their risks or utilize large deductibles on purchased insurance.   bond underwrites and markets its products to national, mid-sized and small businesses and organizations as well as individuals, and distributes them
through both national and wholesale brokers, and retail agents and regional brokers. bond competes in the highly competitive surety and executive liability marketplaces. both national and regional property casualty insurance companies compete with
bond. bonds reputation for timely and consistent decision-making, a nationwide network of local underwriting, claims and industry experts and strong producer and customer relationships as well as its ability to offer its customers a full range
of products, enable it to compete effectively. bonds ability to cross-sell its products to customers of the commercial and personal segments provides further competitive advantages for the company.   construction business has historically been written through independent
agents and brokers. competitors in this industry include both national property casualty insurance companies and regional insurance companies. companies compete on price, coverage offerings, claim and loss prevention services, managed care cost
containment and risk management information systems. construction offers a nationwide network of localized, dedicated claim service professionals that provide greater flexibility in claims adjusting and allows construction to more quickly respond to
the needs of its customers. in addition, dedicated risk control professionals work directly with customers in the evaluation, design and implementation of safety programs to better control risk and exposure to loss.   financial and professional services business is typically written through
national brokers, regional brokers, and independent agents. insurance companies compete on price and product offerings. the company has developed a strong reputation in this complex, dynamic market segment and has an advantage over many of its
competitors in offering a wide breadth of professional and general property and casualty coverages to its financial and professional customers.   there are several other domestic business groups in specialty that compete in focused target markets. each of these markets are different and require
unique combinations of industry knowledge, proprietary coverage forms, specialized risk control and loss handling services, and partnerships with agents and brokers that also focus on these markets. in some cases the competition is national carriers
with similarly dedicated underwriting and marketing groups. in other cases smaller regional companies tend to be the primary competition. in either case these businesses have regional structures that allow them to deliver personalized service and
local knowledge to their customer base. specialized agents and brokers supplement this strategy. in all of these businesses, the competitive strategy is market leadership attained through focused industry knowledge applied to insurance and risk
needs.   international specialty competes with numerous
international and local country insurers in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of ireland. companies compete on the basis of price, product offerings and the level of claim and risk management services provided. specialty has developed
expertise in various specialty markets in these countries similar to those served in the united states and provides both property and casualty coverage for these markets. this specialty focus is a particular competitive advantage in these countries
where our competitors tend to be more product or line of business oriented. products are generally distributed through a fairly small number of local country brokers and agents whose customer groups align with the companys specialty markets.
at lloyds, international specialty competes with other
syndicates operating in the lloyds market as well as international and domestic insurers in the various markets where international specialty writes business worldwide. syndicates are increasingly capitalized by corporate capital, much of
which is provided by large international insurance enterprises. competition is again based on price and product offerings. international specialty has an exclusive focus on lines it believes it can underwrite effectively and profitably with an
emphasis on short-tail insurance (versus reinsurance) lines. specialty underwrites four major classes of business at lloyds: marine, personal, property and aviation.

personal. personal lines insurance is written by hundreds of insurance companies of varying sizes.
although national companies write the majority of the business, personal also faces competition from local or regional companies which often have a competitive advantage because of their knowledge of the local marketplace and their relationship with
local agents. personal believes that the principal competitive factors are price, service, perceived stability of the insurer and name recognition. personal competes for business within each independent agency since these agencies also offer
policies of competing companies. at the agency level, competition is primarily based on price and the level of service, including claims handling, as well as the level of automation and the development of long-term relationships with individual
agents. personal also competes with insurance companies that use exclusive agents or salaried employees to sell their products. in addition to its traditional independent agency distribution, personal has broadened its distribution of products by
marketing to sponsoring organizations, including employee and affinity groups, and through joint marketing arrangements with other insurers. personal believes that its continued focus on expense management practices, underwriting and pricing
segmentation, and claim settlement effectiveness strategies enable personal to price its products competitively in all of its distribution channels.   asset management. nuveen investments is subject to substantial competition in all aspects of its business. the registered representatives that
distribute nuveen investments investment products also distribute numerous competing products, often including products sponsored by the retail distribution firms where they are employed. there are relatively few barriers to entry for new
investment management firms. nuveen investments managed account business is also subject to substantial competition from other investment management firms seeking to be approved as managers in the various wrap-fee programs. the
sponsor firms have a limited number of approved managers at the highest and most attractive levels of their programs and closely monitor the investment performance and customer service aspects of such firms on an on-going basis as they evaluate
which firms are eligible for continued participation in these programs. nuveen investments is also subject to competition in obtaining the commitment of underwriters to underwrite its exchange-traded fund offerings. to the extent the increased
competition for underwriting and distribution causes higher distribution costs, nuveen investments net revenue and earnings will be reduced.   investment products are sold to the public by broker/dealers, banks, insurance companies and others, and many competing investment product sponsors offer
a broader array of investment products. many of these institutions have substantially greater resources than nuveen investments. in addition, continuing consolidation in the financial services industry is altering the landscape in which nuveen
investments distributors compete. the effect that continuing change in the brokerage and investment management industries will have on nuveen investments and its competitors cannot be predicted. nuveen investments competes with other providers
of products primarily on the basis of the range of products offered, the investment performance of such products, quality of service, fees charged, the level and type of broker compensation, the manner in which such products are marketed and
distributed, and the services provided to registered representatives and investors.   regulation   state regulation   the companys insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the
various states and jurisdictions in which they transact business. the extent of regulation varies, but generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state. the
regulation, supervision and administration relate, among other things, to standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, premium rates, restrictions on
the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, approval of policy forms and the regulation of market
conduct, including the use of credit information in underwriting as well as other underwriting and claims practices. in addition, many states have enacted variations of competitive

index to financial statements
rate-making laws, which allow insurers to set certain premium rates for certain classes of insurance without having to obtain the prior approval of the state
insurance department. state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of companies and other matters. at the
present time, the companys insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact insurance business in all states, the district of columbia, guam, puerto rico, bermuda, and the u.s. virgin islands, as well as australia, canada, new
zealand, the philippines, the united kingdom, the republic of ireland, south africa and central and south america.   as part of ongoing, industry-wide investigations, the company and its affiliates have received subpoenas from several government agencies, including 14
states and the sec. the areas of inquiry addressed to the company include its relationship with brokers and agents, the companys involvement with non-traditional insurance and reinsurance products, lawyer liability insurance and
branding requirements for salvage automobiles. the company is cooperating fully with these subpoenas and requests for information.   insurance holding company statutes   as a holding company, the company is not regulated as an insurance company. however, as the company owns capital stock in insurance subsidiaries, it is
subject to state insurance holding company statutes, as well as certain other laws, of each of the states of domicile of the companys insurance subsidiaries. all holding company statutes, as well as other laws, require disclosure and, in some
instances, prior approval of material transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate. the holding company statutes as well as other laws also require, among other things, prior approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer,
some transactions between affiliates and the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions.   insurance regulation concerning dividends   the companys principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the states of connecticut and minnesota. the insurance holding company laws of both states applicable to the companys subsidiaries require
notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, that together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurers surplus as
of the preceding december 31, or the insurers net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding december 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. (in the case of minnesota, net income excludes
realized investment gains for purposes of the calculation of the 10% threshold.) this declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.   the insurance holding company laws of other states in which the
companys insurance subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends.   assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements   virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state
to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as a result of the insolvency of other insurers. depending upon state law, insurers can be assessed an amount that is generally equal to between 1% and 2% of premiums written for the relevant
lines of insurance in that state each year to pay the claims of an insolvent insurer. part of these payments is recoverable through premium rates, premium tax credits or policy surcharges. significant increases in assessments could limit the ability
of the companys insurance subsidiaries to recover such assessments through tax credits or other means. in addition, there have been some legislative efforts to limit or repeal the tax offset provisions, which efforts, to date, have been
generally unsuccessful. these assessments are expected to increase in the future as a result of recent insolvencies.

many states have laws that established second-injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees
for aggravation of a prior condition or injury. insurers writing workers compensation in those states having second-injury funds are subject to the laws creating the funds, including the various funding mechanisms that those states have
adopted to fund the second-injury funds. several of the states having larger second-injury funds utilize a premium surcharge that effectively passes the cost of the fund to policyholders. other states assess the insurer based on paid losses and
allow the insurer to recoup the assessment through future premium rates.   the companys insurance subsidiaries are also required to participate in various involuntary assigned risk pools, principally involving workers compensation and automobile insurance, which provide various
insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage in the voluntary market. participation in these pools in most states is generally in proportion to voluntary writings of related lines of
business in that state. in the event that a member of that pool becomes insolvent, the remaining members assume an additional pro rata share of the liabilities of the pool. the underwriting results of these pools traditionally have been
unprofitable. combined earned premiums related to such pools and assigned risks for the company were $168 million, $160 million and $148 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the related combined underwriting losses for the company were $71
million, $111 million and $39 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.   proposed legislation and regulatory changes have been introduced in the states from time to time that would modify some of the laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry, including the use of
information. the potential impact of that legislation on the companys businesses cannot be predicted at this time.   insurance regulations concerning change of control   many state insurance regulatory laws intended primarily for the protection of policyholders contain provisions that require advance approval by state
agencies of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled, or, in some cases, having substantial business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled, in that state. the company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the shares of
stock of property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the states of arizona, california, connecticut, delaware, florida, illinois, indiana, iowa, maryland, massachusetts, minnesota, mississippi, new jersey, new york, texas and wisconsin.
control is generally presumed to exist through the ownership of 10% (5% in the case of florida) or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or of any company that controls a domestic insurance company. any purchaser
of shares of common stock representing 10% (5% in the case of florida) or more of the voting power of the companys capital stock will be presumed to have acquired control of the companys domestic insurance subsidiaries unless, following
application by that purchaser in each insurance subsidiarys state of domicile, the relevant insurance commissioner determines otherwise.   in addition to these filings, the laws of many states contain provisions requiring pre-notification to state agencies prior to any change in control of a
non-domestic insurance company admitted to transact business in that state. while these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, they do authorize issuance of cease and desist orders with
respect to the non-domestic insurer if it is determined that some conditions, such as undue market concentration, would result from the acquisition.   any transactions that would constitute a change in control of any of the companys insurer subsidiaries would generally require prior approval by the
insurance departments of the states in which the companys insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or commercially domiciled and may require preacquisition notification in those states that have adopted preacquisition notification provisions and
in which such insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business.   one of the companys insurance subsidiaries and the companys operations at lloyds are domiciled in the united kingdom. insurers in the united kingdom are subject to change of control restrictions in the financial

irish financial services regulatory authority.   some of the
companys other insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in, or authorized to conduct insurance business in, canada. authorized insurers in canada are subject to change of control restrictions in section 407 of the insurance companies act,
including approval of the office of the superintendent of financial institutions.   these requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the ownership of common stock, including transactions that could be advantageous to the companys shareholders.
insurance regulatory information system   the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) insurance
regulatory information system (iris) was developed to help state regulators identify companies that may require special attention. the iris system consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby financial examiners review annual
statements and financial ratios. the statistical phase consists of twelve key financial ratios based on year-end data that are generated from the naic database annually, and each ratio has an established usual range of results. these
ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies.   a ratio result falling outside the usual range of iris ratios is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the
regulatory early monitoring system. furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. generally, an insurance company will become subject to regulatory
scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges of four or more of the ratios. as published by the naic, approximately 18.5% of the companies included in the iris system have reported results outside the usual range on four or more ratios in 2002.
in 2004, most of the companys insurance subsidiaries in
the travelers property casualty pool had results outside the usual range for the estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus ratio, with ratios ranging from 26% to 37% above the usual 25% or lower, due to the lags in the ratios ability to
reflect changes in business volume and business mix. also in 2004, the gulf insurance company, st. paul fire and marine insurance company, united states fidelity and guaranty company, discover reinsurance company and most of the st. paul fire and
marine pool members had unusual values in the one-year and two-year reserve development ratios above the usual values of 20% or lower, due to reserve strengthening actions that occurred in 2003 and 2004. those one-year and two-year reserve
development ratios for gulf insurance company were 44% and 126%, for st. paul fire and marine insurance company the ratios were 24% and 40%, for united states fidelity and guaranty company the ratios were 78% and 29%, and for discover reinsurance
company the ratios were 64% and 151%. the one-year and two-year reserve development ratios for the st. paul fire and marine pool members with unusual values ranged from 22% to 45% and 40% to 93% respectively. united states fidelity and guaranty
company, discover reinsurance company and gulf insurance company had two-year operating ratios of 159%, 108% and 149%, respectively, compared to the usual maximum of 100%, due to the 2004 reserve strengthening actions. united states fidelity and
guaranty company and discover reinsurance company also had change in surplus ratios of 63% and 78%, respectively, compared to a usual maximum of 50%, due to 2004 capital contributions from their parent companies. discover reinsurance company also
had a surplus aid to surplus ratio of 17% compared to the usual maximum of 15%. several of the companys insurance subsidiaries, including gulf insurance company, had investment yield ratios below the usual minimum ratio of 4.5% due to lower
yields on newer investments. this was especially true for those companies with predominately shorter term investments and investments in tax-exempt securities.
in 2003, most of the companys insurance subsidiaries in the travelers property casualty pool had results outside the usual range for the two-year
reserve development to surplus ratio and the estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus ratio ranging from 22% to 51%, which exceeded the usual range of 20% to 25% or lower, primarily because of the pretax statutory income statement charges for
additions to asbestos reserves in 2002. in
table of contents
index to financial statements
addition, one of the companys principal insurance companies had one other ratio outside the usual range. the travelers indemnity company had a
liabilities to liquid assets ratio of 116%, which exceeded the usual maximum result of 105% due primarily to sizable subsidiary investments that are excluded from the calculation of liquid assets and the 2002 increase in asbestos reserves that are
included in liabilities. also in 2003, the insurance companies in the gulf pool had results for the one-year and two-year reserve development to surplus ratios ranging from 75% to 112% and 88% to 120%, respectively, which exceeded the usual result
of 20% or lower for both of these measures because of reserve additions related primarily to the residual value business coupled with increases in core business lines and the reserve for uncollectible reinsurance. the reserve additions also resulted
in the gulf pool companies having two-year overall operating ratios ranging from 128% to 134% which is in excess of the usual value of 100% or lower. in addition, the gulf pool companies had an estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus ratio
ranging from 163% to 268% which exceeded the usual result of 25% or lower also due to these reserve additions. the gulf pool companies had investment yield ratios ranging from 2.7% to 3.4% which is below the normal minimum value of 4.5% reflecting a
shortening of the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio and a decline in interest rates on new investments. gulf insurance company had a liabilities to liquid assets ratio of 115% which exceeded the usual maximum result of 105% due primarily to
increases in reinsurance recoverables, a sizeable investment in subsidiaries that are excluded from the calculation of liquid assets and the reserve additions noted above. gulf underwriters insurance company also had a gross written premiums to
surplus ratio of 1065%, which exceeded the usual maximum value of 900% due to increases in premiums written on core specialty lines of business.   in 2002, most of the companys insurance subsidiaries in the travelers property casualty pool had results outside the usual range for the one year
reserve development to surplus ratio, the two year reserve development to surplus ratio and the estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus ratio ranging from 21% to 44%, which exceeded the usual range of 20% to 25% or lower, primarily because
of the pretax statutory income statement charges for additions to asbestos reserves in 2002. in addition, three of the companys principal insurance companies had other ratios outside the usual range. the travelers indemnity company and the
standard fire insurance company had investment yield ratios of 3.8% and 4.2%, respectively, which were less than the usual results of 4.5% or higher, reflecting the decline in interest rates on new investments and lower dividends from subsidiary
equity investments. the travelers indemnity company and travelers casualty and surety company had liabilities to liquid assets ratios of 120% and 107%, respectively, which exceeded the usual result of 105% or lower due primarily to sizable
subsidiary investments that are excluded from the calculation of liquid assets and an increase in asbestos reserves that are included in liabilities. the travelers casualty and surety company and the standard fire insurance company each had a change
in surplus ratio of -12%, which exceeded the usual result of -10% due to a net loss resulting primarily from charges for additions to asbestos reserves in 2002. also in 2002, the insurance companies in the gulf pool had results for the two year
reserve development to surplus ratio ranging from 32% to 44%, which exceeded the usual result of 20% or lower because of reserve additions related to a run-off product line. in addition, the gulf pool companies had an estimated current reserve
deficiency to surplus ratio ranging from 46% to 84%, which exceeded the usual result of 25% or lower and a change in net writings ratio ranging from 223% to 403%, which exceeded the usual result of 33% or lower primarily due to the effect of their
removal from the travelers property casualty pool and the reestablishment of the gulf pool. gulf insurance company and gulf underwriters insurance company had investment yield ratios of 4.3% and 3.9%, respectively, which were less than the usual
result of 4.5% or higher reflecting a shortening of the duration of the portfolio and a decline in interest rates on new investments. gulf underwriters insurance company also had a gross written premiums to surplus ratio of 1235%, which exceeded the
usual result of 900% or lower due to increases in premiums written on core specialty lines and the effect of the companies removal from the travelers property casualty pool and the reestablishment of the gulf pool.   in all of these instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon
follow-up that no regulatory action was required. it is possible that similar results could occur in the future. management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2004 iris ratio results. no regulatory action has been taken by any
state insurance department or the naic with respect to iris ratios of any of the companys insurance subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2003.

risk-based capital (rbc) requirements   in order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the naic has adopted a formula and model law to implement rbc
requirements for most property and casualty insurance companies, which is designed to determine minimum capital requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. the rbc formula for
property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers:
underwriting, which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing;
declines in asset values arising from market and/or credit risk; and
off-balance sheet risk arising from adverse experience from non-controlled assets, guarantees for affiliates or other contingent liabilities and reserve and premium growth.
under laws adopted by individual states,
insurers having total adjusted capital less than that required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy.   the rbc law provides for four levels of regulatory action. the extent of
regulatory intervention and action increases as the level of surplus to rbc falls. the first level, the company action level as defined by the naic, requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the regulator if surplus falls below
200% of the rbc amount. the regulatory action level, as defined by the naic, requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and requires the relevant insurance commissioner to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a
corrective order if surplus falls below 150% of the rbc amount. the authorized control level, as defined by the naic, authorizes the relevant insurance commissioner to take whatever regulatory actions considered necessary to protect the best
interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer which may include the actions necessary to cause the insurer to be placed under regulatory control, i.e., rehabilitation or liquidation, if surplus falls below 100% of the rbc amount. the
fourth action level is the mandatory control level as defined by the naic, which requires the relevant insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control if surplus falls below 70% of the rbc amount.   the formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately
capitalized companies that operate with higher levels of capital. therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. at december 31, 2004, all of the companys property and casualty insurance

collectively accounted for approximately 13% of the carrying value of the property portfolio at december 31, 2004.   in the opinion of the companys management, the companys properties are adequate and suitable for its business as presently conducted and are
adequately maintained.
item 3. legal proceedings   this
section describes the major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the company or its subsidiaries are a party or to which any of the companys property is subject.   asbestos and environmental-related proceedings   in the ordinary course of its insurance business, the company receives
claims for insurance arising under policies issued by the company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos and other hazardous waste and toxic substances which are the subject of related coverage litigation, including, among others, the
litigation described below. the company continues to be subject to aggressive asbestos-related litigation. the conditions surrounding the final resolution of these claims and the related litigation continue to change.   tpc is involved in three significant proceedings relating to acands, inc.
(acands), formerly a national distributor and installer of products containing asbestos, including acands bankruptcy proceedings. the proceedings involve disputes as to whether and to what extent any of acands potential liabilities for
bodily injury asbestos claims are covered by insurance policies issued by tpc. these proceedings have resulted in decisions favorable to tpc, although those decisions are subject to appellate review. the status of the various proceedings is
described below.   acands filed for bankruptcy in september 2002
(in re: acands, inc., pending in the u.s. bankruptcy court for the district of delaware). in its proposed plan of reorganization, acands sought to establish a trust to pay asbestos bodily injury claims against it and sought to assign to the
trust its rights under the insurance policies issued by tpc. the proposed plan and disclosure statement filed by acands claimed that acands had settled the vast majority of asbestos-related bodily injury claims currently pending against it for
approximately $2.80 billion. acands asserts that, based on a prior agreement between tpc and acands and acands interpretation of the july 31, 2003 arbitration panel ruling described below, tpc is liable for 45% of the $2.80 billion. on january
26, 2004, the bankruptcy court issued a decision rejecting confirmation of acands proposed plan of
table of contents
index to financial statements
reorganization. the bankruptcy court found, consistent with tpcs objections to acands proposed plan, that the proposed plan was not fundamentally
fair, was not proposed in good faith and did not comply with section 524(g) of the bankruptcy code. acands has filed a notice of appeal of the bankruptcy courts decision and has filed objections to the bankruptcy courts findings of fact
and conclusions of law in the united states district court. tpc has moved to dismiss the appeal and objections and has also filed an opposition to acands objections.   an arbitration was commenced in january 2001 to determine whether and to what extent acands financial obligations for
bodily injury asbestos claims are subject to insurance policy aggregate limits. on july 31, 2003, the arbitration panel ruled in favor of tpc that asbestos bodily injury claims against acands are subject to the aggregate limits of the policies
issued to acands, which have been exhausted. in october 2003, acands commenced a lawsuit seeking to vacate the arbitration award as beyond the panels scope of authority (acands, inc. v. travelers casualty and surety co., u.s.d.ct., e.d.
pa.). on september 16, 2004, the court entered an order denying acands motion to vacate the arbitration award. on october 6, 2004, acands filed a notice of appeal. briefing of the appeal is complete. oral argument has not been scheduled.
in the other proceeding, a related case pending before the
same court and commenced in september 2000 (acands v. travelers casualty and surety co., u.s.d. ct., e.d. pa.), acands sought a declaration of the extent to which the asbestos bodily injury claims against acands are subject to occurrence
limits under insurance policies issued by tpc. tpc filed a motion to dismiss this action based upon the july 31, 2003 arbitration decision described above. the court found the dispute was moot as a result of the arbitration panels decision.
the court, therefore, based on the arbitration panels decision, dismissed the case. on october 6, 2004, acands filed a notice of appeal. this appeal has been consolidated with the appeal referenced in the paragraph above. briefing of the
appeal is complete. oral argument has not been scheduled.   while the company cannot predict the outcome of the appeals of the various acands rulings or other legal actions, based on these rulings, the company would not have any significant obligations remaining under any policies issued by tpc to
acands.   in october 2001 and april 2002, two purported class
action suits (wise v. travelers and meninger v. travelers), were filed against tpc and other insurers (not including spc) in state court in west virginia. these cases were subsequently consolidated into a single proceeding in circuit
court of kanawha county, west virginia. plaintiffs allege that the insurer defendants engaged in unfair trade practices by inappropriately handling and settling asbestos claims. the plaintiffs seek to reopen large numbers of settled asbestos claims
and to impose liability for damages, including punitive damages, directly on insurers. lawsuits similar to wise were filed in massachusetts and hawaii (these suits are collectively referred to as the statutory and hawaii actions).
also, in november 2001, plaintiffs in consolidated asbestos actions pending before a mass tort panel of judges in west virginia state court moved to amend their complaint to name tpc as a defendant, alleging that tpc and other insurers breached
alleged duties to certain users of asbestos products. in march 2002, the court granted the motion to amend. plaintiffs seek damages, including punitive damages. lawsuits seeking similar relief and raising allegations similar to those presented in
the west virginia amended complaint are also pending in ohio and texas state courts against tpc and spc and in louisiana state court against tpc (the claims asserted in these suits, together with the west virginia suit, are collectively referred to
as the common law claims).   all of the actions
against tpc described in the preceding paragraph, other than the hawaii actions, had been subject to a temporary restraining order entered by the federal bankruptcy court in new york that had previously presided over and approved the reorganization
in bankruptcy of tpcs former policyholder johns- manville. in august 2002, the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on tpcs motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting further prosecution of the lawsuits pursuant to the
reorganization plan and related orders. at the conclusion of this hearing, the court ordered the parties to mediation, appointed a mediator and continued the temporary restraining order. during 2003, the same bankruptcy court extended the existing
injunction to apply to an additional set of cases filed in various state courts in texas and ohio as well as to the attorneys who
table of contents
index to financial statements
are prosecuting these cases. the order also enjoined these attorneys and their respective law firms from commencing any further lawsuits against tpc based
upon these allegations without the prior approval of the court. notwithstanding the injunction, additional common law claims were filed and served on tpc.   on november 19, 2003, the parties advised the bankruptcy court that a settlement of the statutory and hawaii actions had been reached. this settlement
includes a lump sum payment of up to $412 million by tpc, subject to a number of significant contingencies. after continued meetings with the mediator, the parties advised the bankruptcy court on may 25, 2004 that a settlement resolving
substantially all pending and similar future common law claims against tpc had also been reached. this settlement requires a payment of up to $90 million by tpc, subject to a number of significant contingencies. each of these settlements is
contingent upon, among other things, an order of the bankruptcy court clarifying that all of these claims, and similar future asbestos-related claims against tpc, are barred by prior orders entered by the bankruptcy court in connection with the
original johns-manville bankruptcy proceedings.   on august 17,
2004, the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the settlements and clarifying its prior orders that all of the pending statutory and hawaii actions and substantially all common law claims pending against tpc are barred. the order also applies
to similar direct action claims that may be filed in the future.   five appeals were taken from the august 17, 2004 ruling. these appeals have been consolidated and are currently pending. the parties have completed briefing all of the issues and await a date for oral argument. the company has no obligation
to pay any of the settlement amounts unless and until the orders and relief become final and are not subject to any further appellate review. it is not possible to predict how appellate courts will rule on the pending appeals.   spc, which is not covered by the bankruptcy court rulings or the settlements
described above, has numerous defenses in all of the direct action cases asserting common law claims that are pending against it. many of these defenses have been raised in initial motions to dismiss filed by spc and other insurers. there have been
favorable rulings during 2003 and 2004 in texas and during 2004 in ohio on some of these motions filed by spc and other insurers that dealt with statute of limitations and the validity of the alleged causes of actions. the plaintiffs in these
actions have appealed these favorable rulings. spcs defenses include the fact that these novel theories have no basis in law; that they are directly at odds with the well established law pertaining to the insured/insurer relationship; that
there is no generalized duty to warn as alleged by the plaintiffs; and that the applicable statute of limitations as to many of these claims has long since expired.   the company is defending its asbestos and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious
defenses; however, the outcome of these disputes is uncertain. in this regard, the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under
appropriate circumstances. for a discussion of other information regarding the companys asbestos and environmental exposure, see item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationsasbestos claims and litigation, environmental claims and litigation and uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves.   currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and their impact on
the future development of claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. any such development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. because of these
uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, the companys estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in
estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the companys results of operations and financial condition in future periods.

shareholder litigation and related proceedings   tpc and its board of directors were named as defendants in three putative class action lawsuits brought by shareholders
alleging breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the merger of tpc and spc and seeking injunctive relief as well as unspecified monetary damages. the actions were captioned henzel, et al. v. travelers property casualty corp., et al. (jud.
dist. of waterbury, ct. nov. 17, 2003); vozzolo v. travelers property casualty corp., et al. (jud. dist. of waterbury, ct. nov. 17, 2003); and farina v. travelers property casualty corp., et al. (jud. dist. of waterbury, ct. december
15, 2003). the farina complaint also named spc and its former subsidiary, adams acquisition corp., as defendants, alleging that they aided and abetted the alleged breach of fiduciary duty. on march 18, 2004, tpc and spc announced that all of
these lawsuits had been settled, subject to court approval of the settlements. the settlement included a modification to the termination fee that could have been paid had the merger not been completed, additional disclosure in the proxy statement
distributed in connection with the merger and a nominal amount for attorneys fees. before court approval of the settlement, additional shareholder litigation was commenced, as described below. in light of that litigation, the parties are
evaluating how to proceed.   beginning in august 2004, following
post-merger announcements by the company, various shareholders of the company commenced fourteen putative class action lawsuits against the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the united states district court for
the district of minnesota. plaintiff shareholders allege that certain disclosures relating to the april 2004 merger between tpc and spc contained false or misleading statements with respect to the value of spcs loss reserves in violation of
federal securities laws. the complaints do not specify damages. these actions have been consolidated under the caption in re st. paul travelers securities litigation. plaintiffs have not yet filed a consolidated class action complaint.
an additional putative class action based on the same allegations was brought in new york state supreme court. this action was subsequently transferred to, and is currently pending in, the district of minnesota.   in addition, five other actions against the company and certain of its
current and former officers and directors are pending in the united states district court for the district of minnesota. two of these actions, kahn v. the st. paul travelers companies, inc., et al. (nov. 2, 2004) and michael a. bernstein
profit sharing plan v. the st. paul travelers companies, inc., et al. (nov. 10, 2004), are putative class actions brought by certain shareholders of the company against the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors. in
these two actions, plaintiff shareholders allege violations of federal securities laws in connection with the companys alleged failure to make disclosure relating to the practice of paying brokers commissions on a contingent basis. two
derivative actions have been brought against all current directors of the company, naming the company as a nominal defendant. in rowe v. fishman, et al. (oct. 22, 2004), the plaintiff shareholder alleges state law claims, including breach of
fiduciary duty, based on allegations similar to those alleged in in re st. paul travelers securities litigation described above. in clark v. fishman, et al. (nov. 18, 2004), the plaintiff shareholder alleges state law claims, including
breach of fiduciary duty, based on the companys alleged mismanagement of and failure to make disclosure relating to the practice of paying brokers commissions on a contingent basis. the derivative actions have been consolidated for pretrial
proceedings as rowe, et al. v. fishman, et al. in the fifth of these actions, an alleged beneficiary of the companys 401(k) savings plan has commenced a putative class action in the district of minnesota against the company and certain
of its current and former officers and directors captioned spiziri v. the st. paul travelers companies, inc., et al. (dec. 28, 2004). the plaintiff alleges violations of the employee retirement income security act based on allegations similar
to those alleged in in re st.paul travelers securities litigation.   the company believes that these lawsuits have no merit and intends to defend vigorously; however, the company is not able to provide any assurance that one or more of these proceedings will not be material to the
companys results of operations in a future period. the company is obligated to indemnify its officers and directors to the extent provided under minnesota law. as part of that obligation, the company will advance officers and directors
attorneys fees and other expenses they incur in defending these lawsuits.

other proceedings   in previous filings, the company reported on a series of purported class actions and one multi-party action brought in various courts around the united
states against certain of tpcs subsidiaries, dozens of other insurers and the national council on compensation insurance. the allegations in the actions were substantially similar, and generally alleged that the defendants conspired to collect
excessive or improper premiums on loss-sensitive workers compensation insurance policies in violation of state insurance laws, antitrust laws, and state unfair trade practices laws. the plaintiffs in the actions do not specify damages. tpc has
vigorously defended the actions, with all but a few of the actions having been dismissed to date. in addition, the plaintiffs attempts to obtain class certification have not been successful. under the present circumstances, the company does
not believe its remaining exposure to be significant.   from time to time the company is involved in proceedings addressing disputes with its reinsurers regarding the collection of amounts due under the companys reinsurance agreements. these proceedings may be initiated by the company or
the reinsurers and may involve the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the coverage of particular claims, exclusions under the agreements, as well as counterclaims for rescission of the agreements. one of these disputes is the action described in
the following paragraph.   gulf, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
tpc, brought an action on may 22, 2003, as amended on may 12, 2004, in the supreme court of new york, county of new york (gulf insurance company v. transatlantic reinsurance company, et al.), against transatlantic reinsurance company
(transatlantic), xl reinsurance america, inc. (xl), odyssey america reinsurance corporation (odyssey), employers reinsurance company (employers) and gerling global reinsurance corporation of america (gerling), to recover amounts due under
reinsurance contracts issued to gulf and related to gulfs february 2003 settlement of a coverage dispute under a vehicle residual value protection insurance policy. the reinsurers have asserted counterclaims seeking rescission of the vehicle
residual value reinsurance contracts issued to gulf and unspecified damages for breach of contract. separate actions filed by transatlantic and gerling have been consolidated with the original gulf action for pre-trial purposes. on october 1, 2003,
gulf entered into a final settlement agreement with employers, and all claims and counterclaims with respect to employers have been dismissed.   on may 26, 2004, the court denied gulfs motion to dismiss certain claims asserted by transatlantic and a joint motion by transatlantic, xl and
odyssey for summary judgment against gulf. discovery is currently proceeding in the matters. gulf denies the reinsurers allegations, believes that it has a strong legal basis to collect the amounts due under the reinsurance contracts and
intends to vigorously pursue the actions.   based on the
companys beliefs about its legal positions in its various reinsurance recovery proceedings, the company does not expect any of these matters to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in a future period.   as part of ongoing, industry-wide investigations, the company and its
affiliates have received subpoenas and written requests for information from government agencies. the areas of inquiry addressed to the company include its relationship with brokers and agents, the companys involvement with
non-traditional insurance and reinsurance products, lawyer liability insurance and branding requirements for salvage automobiles. the company or its affiliates have received subpoenas or written requests for information from: (i) state
of california office of the attorney general; (ii) state of california department of insurance; (iii) licensing and market conduct compliance division, financial services commission of ontario, canada; (iv) state of connecticut insurance department;
(v) state of connecticut office of the attorney general; (vi) state of delaware department of insurance; (vii) state of florida department of financial services; (viii) state of florida office of insurance regulation; (ix) state of florida

(xix) commonwealth of pennsylvania office of the attorney general; (xx) state of texas department of insurance; (xxi) state of west virginia office of attorney general; and (xxii) the united states securities and exchange commission. the company is
cooperating fully with these subpoenas and requests for information. in addition, the company is currently undertaking its own review of the matters addressed by these subpoenas and requests for information. the company is not able to predict the
outcome of the various agencies investigations or the reviews being undertaken, or how these matters may affect the company, if at all.   four putative class action lawsuits have been brought against a number of insurance brokers and insurers, including the company, by plaintiffs who
allegedly purchased insurance products through one or more of the defendant brokers. the complaints are captioned shell vacations llc v. marsh & mclennan companies, inc. (n.d. ill. jan. 14, 2005), redwood oil company v. marsh &
mclennan companies, inc. (n.d. ill. jan. 21, 2005); boros v. marsh & mclennan companies, inc. (n.d. cal. feb. 4, 2005) and mulcahey v. arthur j. gallagher & co. (d.n.j. february 23, 2005). plaintiffs allege that various
insurance brokers conspired with each other and with various insurers, including the company, to allocate brokerage customers and rig bids for insurance products offered to those customers. the complaints include causes of action under the sherman
act, the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act, federal and state common law and the laws of the various states prohibiting antitrust violations and unfair and/or deceptive trade practices. plaintiffs seek monetary damages, including
punitive damages and trebled damages, permanent injunctive relief, restitution, including disgorgement of profits, interest and costs, including attorneys fees. the company believes that these lawsuits have no merit and intends to defend
vigorously.   in addition to those described above, the
company is involved in numerous lawsuits, not involving asbestos and environmental claims, arising mostly in the ordinary course of business operations either as a liability insurer defending third-party claims brought against policyholders or as an
insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. while the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings could be significant to the companys results of operations in a future quarter, in the opinion of the companys management it
would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations for a calendar year or on the companys financial condition or liquidity.

the companys discussions related to all items, other than net income (loss), are presented on a
pretax basis, unless otherwise noted.   net income in 2004
totaled $955 million, or $1.53 per share diluted, compared with net income of $1.70billion, or $3.80 per share diluted, in 2003. the $741 million decline in net income in 2004 compared with 2003 was driven by $1.59 billion of after-tax net
unfavorable prior-year reserve development ($2.39 billion pretax). that pretax net unfavorable prior year reserve development was primarily comprised of $928 million to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result of the completion of the
companys annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter, $290 million to strengthen environmental reserves, reserve adjustments related to the merger of $500 million for construction and $300 million for surety, $252 million related to
a specific construction contractor, $113 million related to the commutation of agreements with a major reinsurer and other net reserving actions, the major components of which are described in more detail in the following segment discussions. net
unfavorable reserve development in the commercial and specialty segments more than offset additional income resulting from the merger and strong operating income generated by the companys personal segment. in addition, after-tax catastrophe
losses in 2004 of $511 million were $282 million higher than in 2003. the catastrophe losses in 2004 were primarily driven by four hurricanes that struck the southeastern united states in the third quarter.   the rate environment continued to moderate in 2004 due to more aggressive
pricing in the marketplace. customer retention levels remained stable throughout the companys insurance underwriting operations; however, new business volume in 2004 declined when compared with the combined new business volume of spc and tpc
in 2003. net income in 2004 included net realized investment losses of $28 million, compared with net realized investment gains of $21 million in 2003.   net income of $1.70 billion in 2003 was a significant improvement over the net loss of $27 million in 2002. results in 2003 reflected a favorable, but
moderating, rate environment in excess of loss cost trends and a decline in unfavorable prior year reserve development. those factors were partially offset by a $174 million increase in after-tax catastrophe losses in 2003. net unfavorable prior
year reserve development in 2003 was $309 million, including $339 million of charges related to reserve strengthening in the companys subsidiary gulf insurance company (gulf). in 2002, the $1.49 billion of net unfavorable prior year reserve
development was driven by $1.39 billion of charges related to asbestos reserve strengthening. in december 2002, the company increased its asbestos reserves to $3.40 billion, net of reinsurance recoverables, and fully utilized the $800 million pretax
benefit under the citigroup indemnification agreement. (for additional information see asbestos claims and litigation). the net loss in 2002 included an after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
of $243 million due to the adoption of financial accounting standards board (fasb) statement of financial accounting standards no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets (fas 142). net income in 2003 included $21 million of net realized
investment gains, compared with $99 million of net realized investment gains in 2002.   consolidated revenues   the companys

the $6.49 billion growth in earned premiums over 2003 was primarily due to the merger, and also reflected
the earned premium effect of rate increases on renewal business over the last 12 months and strong customer retention levels throughout a majority of the markets served by the companys insurance segments.   net investment income in 2004 increased $794 million over 2003, due largely
to the increase in invested assets resulting from the merger. in addition, strong operational cash flows in 2004 contributed to the growth in invested assets. the average pretax investment yield in 2004 of 4.8% declined from 5.3% in 2003, due to a
higher proportion of tax-exempt investments and lower yields on fixed income securities and alternative investments. in addition, spcs investment portfolio acquired in the merger was recorded at its fair value as of the merger date in
accordance with purchase accounting, which reduced the companys reported average investment yield in 2004. net investment income in 2004 included $111 million of income resulting from the initial public trading of an investment in its private
equity portfolio.   fee income in 2004 grew 26% over 2003,
primarily driven by new business in the national accounts sector of the companys commercial segment, as described in more detail in the segment narrative that follows.   asset management revenues of $390 million were generated by nuveen investments, which was acquired in the merger. nuveen
investments gross sales of investment products in 2004 from the date of the merger totaled $19.86 billion.   the companys net pretax realized investment losses of $39 million in 2004 included impairment charges totaling $80 million, whereas net pretax
realized gains of $38 million in 2003 included $90 million of impairment charges. net realized investment gains (losses) in 2004 and 2003 also included losses of $44 million and $27 million, respectively, related to u.s. treasury futures contracts
which are settled daily. further information regarding the nature of impairment charges in each year is included in the critical accounting estimates section later in this discussion. other revenues in all periods presented primarily
consist of premium installment charges.   earned premiums in
2003 increased $1.39 billion, or 12%, over 2002 due to rate increases on renewal business, growth in targeted new business and strong customer retention.   net investment income decreased $12 million, or less than 1%, in 2003, despite higher average invested assets resulting from strong cash flows from
operations. the decline resulted from a reduction in pretax investment yields from 6.0% in 2002 to 5.3% in 2003. that decrease reflected the lower interest rate environment, the shortening of the average effective duration of the fixed maturity
portfolio, a higher proportion of tax-exempt investment holdings and reduced returns in the companys private equity investments. these factors were partially offset by higher returns in arbitrage fund investments.   fee income increased $105 million, or 23%, in 2003, as both new business and
pricing levels in the companys national accounts business increased and more workers compensation business was written by state residual market pools serviced by national accounts.   net realized investment gains were $38 million in 2003, compared with $147
million in 2002. net realized investment gains included $90 million of impairment charges in 2003, compared with $284 million in 2002.   recoveries from former affiliate of $520 million, net of tax, in 2002 represent funds recovered under the citigroup indemnification agreement.
effective with the merger, the companys business operations consist
of the following four segments: commercial, specialty, personal (collectively comprising the companys insurance segments) and asset management. the asset management segment was acquired in the merger. prior period results for the three
insurance segments have been restated, to the extent practicable, to conform with the 2004 presentation.

the $5.74 billion, or
43%, increase in consolidated net written premiums in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily reflected the impact of the merger. on a pro forma combined basis, net written premiums in 2004 were level with 2003. business retention levels in the majority
of the companys insurance operations remained consistent with 2003 levels, as the company focused on retaining its existing book of well priced, profitable business. rate increases, however, continued to moderate in 2004, reflecting more
aggressive pricing in the marketplace. new business volume in the commercial and specialty segments in 2004 declined when compared with the combined new business volume of spc and tpc in the prior year, reflecting the competitive marketplace and the
impact of new business premiums in 2003 from renewal rights transactions. the non-renewal of certain commercial property, construction and surety risks and certain personal lines business in the companys operations at lloyds also
negatively impacted premium volume in 2004. personal net written premiums increased 17% in 2004 over 2003, due to strong organic growth, new business resulting from a renewal rights transaction, strong business retention levels and price increases.
net written premiums increased $1.26 billion, or 11%, in 2003.
the increase was primarily due to higher but moderating rate increases, new business growth in favorable markets and strong retention across all major lines of business. these factors were partially offset by the withdrawal in 2002 of business at
american equity insurance company and commercial guaranty casualty insurance company, both subsidiaries of the northland company (northland), a subsidiary of the company, and a one-time additional $115 million of net written premiums in 2002 due to
the termination of certain reinsurance contracts by northland. net written premiums for northlands subsidiaries in 2003 were $547 million, a decrease of 34% from the 2002 total of $825 million. commercial net written premiums, excluding
business written in northlands subsidiaries, increased $1.03 billion, or 16%, in 2003. personal net written premiums increased $506 million, or 11%, in 2003.   consolidated claims and expenses were as follows:

adjustment expenses of $15.44 billion in 2004 were $6.32 billion higher than the comparable 2003 total, primarily reflecting growth in business volume resulting from the merger. the 2004 total also included $2.39 billion of net unfavorable prior
year reserve development, of which $928 million represented a provision to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result of the completion of the companys annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter and $290 million represented
a provision to strengthen environmental reserves. additional components of 2004 unfavorable prior year reserve development are described below. net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2003 totaled $476 million and was primarily the result
of reserve strengthening at the companys gulf subsidiary. the 2004 total also included $772 million of catastrophe losses (net of reinsurance), compared with catastrophe losses of $352 million in 2003.
table of contents
index to financial statements
during the second quarter of 2004, the company recorded $500 million and $300 million of net unfavorable
prior year reserve development related to specialtys construction and surety reserves, respectively, acquired in the merger. upon having access to each companys detailed policyholder information, including underwriting, claim, and
actuarial files on april 1, 2004, in connection with the closing of the merger, the company was able to begin the detailed process of developing a uniform and consistent approach to estimating the combined companys loss reserves. as part of
that process, a team of actuaries representing the historical actuarial perspectives, judgments and methods applied by each legacy company, discussed their views, methodologies, and analysis of available data.   in addition to the discussion in the critical accounting estimates
section of this report, other items specifically considered in the process of developing a uniform and consistent approach to estimating the combined companys loss reserves include interpreting the actuarial and claim data in a uniform manner
and determining an appropriate level of data segmentation for estimation purposes. this type of analysis involves a high degree of judgment and can, and often does, lead to reserve estimates that differ materially from those of prior periods,
particularly in low frequency, high severity and complex exposures. in addition, since the reserving process also considers the expectations of future outcomes, the actuaries involved had to analyze their differing views on key assumptions, such as
predicting inflation, estimating claim development patterns and determining expectations related to judicial rulings and interpretations, among others. this informed judgment is brought into the process by individuals such as actuaries,
underwriters, claim adjusters, and company management. ultimately, this process required an analysis of the varying actuarial judgments and forward-looking assessments. the result was similar to a single, ongoing insurance enterprise obtaining more
information in a reporting period than it had previously and identifying a change in estimate in its insurance reserves in that period. accordingly, the company recorded a $500 million and $300 million charge for construction and surety,
respectively, in the second quarter of 2004.   additional
information on the analysis performed is included in the specialty segment discussion below.   in june of 2004, the company decided to commute certain reinsurance agreements with a major reinsurer resulting in a $113 million prior year reserve charge (in addition to a current year loss of $40 million).
commutations are a complete and final settlement with a reinsurer that results in a discharge of all obligations of the parties to the terminated reinsurance agreement. the company also recorded a charge of $252 million related to a specific
construction contractor as described in the specialty segment discussion.   other items increasing the 2004 claims and expenses compared to 2003 include $296 million of charges to increase the allowances for estimated amounts due from reinsurance recoverables, policyholders receivables, and
co-surety participations on a specific construction contractor claim. the increase in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables recognized a change in estimated disputes with reinsurers and is based upon the companys reinsurance
strategy of reduced reinsurance utilization, including the cessation of ongoing business relationships with certain of spcs reinsurers, and aggressive collection of reinsurance recoverables. a provision was also made to increase the estimated
uncollectible amounts due from policyholders for loss sensitive business (primarily high deductible business). this increase recognized a change in estimated uncollectible amounts due and resulted from applying the companys credit based
methodology for determining uncollectible amounts to the recoverables acquired in the merger. because reinsurance recoverables and amounts due from policyholders for loss sensitive business are insurance contract-related assets, these assets are
subject to the same types of estimation variables as loss reserves. also during the second quarter of 2004, a participating co-surety on a contract surety exposure announced that insurance regulators had approved its submitted run-off plan. based
upon industry knowledge of the co-suretys run-off plan and an analysis of the co-suretys financial condition, the company concluded that it was unlikely to collect the full amount projected to be owed by the co-surety and established an
appropriate level of reserves.   other 2004 claims and expenses
related to the merger include $29 million of restructuring charges, $92 million of amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets acquired in the merger, and a benefit of $58 million associated with the accretion of the fair value
adjustment to claims and claim adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables. interest expense in 2004 included $100 million of additional interest expense on spc debt assumed in the merger.

claims and claim adjustment expenses decreased $2.02 billion, or 18%, in 2003 primarily due to a decline
in unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2003, which was partially offset by increased loss costs, growth in business volume and higher catastrophe losses. catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, were $352 million in 2003 compared to $84
million in 2002. unfavorable prior year reserve development included in claims and claim adjustment expenses was $476 million for 2003, compared to $3.09 billion in 2002. unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2002 included $2.95 billion of
asbestos incurred losses (prior to the benefit related to recoveries under the citigroup indemnification agreement), whereas 2003 included no asbestos-related unfavorable prior year reserve development.   amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased $174 million, or 10%, in
2003, reflecting higher commission and premium taxes associated with the increases in earned premiums previously described. interest expense increased $9 million, or 6%, in 2003 due to certain one time costs associated with first and second quarter
refinancing activities that lowered average interest costs, and higher levels of temporary debt. general and administrative expenses increased $217 million, or 15%, in 2003, reflecting business growth and higher commissions that resulted from
improved underwriting results.   effective tax rate. the
companys effective tax rate was 12.2%, 24.1% and (183.4)% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the decrease in the 2004 effective rate primarily reflected the impact of an increase in nontaxable investment income on a lower level of pretax
income. the 2003 increase in the effective rate reflected a higher level of pretax income associated with improved underwriting performance. the 2002 effective rate reflected the impact of the 2002 asbestos charge previously discussed, as well as
the impact of non-taxable recoveries of $520 million related to the citigroup indemnification agreement.   the gaap combined ratios before policyholder dividends were as follows:

excludes losses recovered under the citigroup indemnification agreement in 2002.   the gaap combined ratio in 2004 included a 12.6 point impact from net unfavorable prior year reserve development and a 4.0
point impact from catastrophes. the respective impacts of these factors on the 2003 combined ratio were 3.8 points and 2.8 points. excluding these impacts from both years, the adjusted ratio of 91.1 in 2004 was 1.4 points higher than the adjusted
2003 combined ratio of 89.7. the increase in the adjusted ratio primarily reflected the impact of the higher underwriting expense ratio of the business acquired in the merger, as well as expenses associated with the merger.   the 20.3 point improvement in the 2003 gaap combined ratio resulted from
lower unfavorable prior year reserve development, primarily due to having no asbestos charges in 2003, compared to asbestos charges in 2002 that added 19.2 points. the benefit from premium rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends were largely
offset by higher catastrophe losses.   renewal rights purchases
during the third quarter of 2003, tpc purchased from
royal & sunalliance usa (rsa), an unaffiliated insurer, the renewal rights to rsas commercial lines national accounts, middle market and marine businesses, and standard and preferred personal lines businesses. also during the third quarter
of 2003, tpc purchased from atlantic mutual, an unaffiliated insurer, the renewal rights to the majority of atlantic mutuals commercial lines inland marine and ocean cargo businesses written by atlantic mutuals marine division. the
minimum purchase price for both transactions, which has been paid, was $48 million. the final purchase price, which is expected to be determined in 2005 and is currently estimated to be $66 million, is dependent on the level of business renewed by
the company.

commercial insurance resources, inc.   on august 1, 2002, commercial insurance resources, inc. (ciri), a subsidiary of the company and the holding company for the
gulf insurance group (gulf), completed a transaction with a group of outside investors and senior employees of gulf. capital investments made by the investors and employees included 9.7 million shares of mandatorily convertible preferred stock for a
purchase price of $8.83 per share, $50 million of convertible notes and 0.4 million common shares for a purchase price of $8.83 per share, representing a 24% ownership interest of ciri, on a fully diluted basis. the dividend rate on the preferred
stock was 6.0%. the interest rate on the notes was 6.0% payable on an interest-only basis. the notes would have matured on december 31, 2032. trident ii, l.p., marsh & mclennan capital professionals fund, l.p., marsh & mclennan
employees securities company, l.p. and trident gulf holding, llc (collectively trident) invested $125 million, and a group of approximately 75 senior employees of gulf invested $14 million. fifty percent of the gulf senior employees
investment was financed by ciri. this financing was collateralized by the ciri securities purchased and was forgivable if trident achieved certain investment returns. the applicable agreements provided for registration rights and transfer rights and
restrictions and other matters customarily addressed in agreements with minority investors.   on may 28, 2004, the travelers indemnity company (indemnity), a subsidiary of the company, completed its purchase of all of the outstanding shares (8,970,000 shares) of the mandatorily convertible preferred stock held
by trident at a purchase price of $8.83 per share and the convertible notes held by trident for $46 million. by june 30, 2004, indemnity completed its purchase from employees of $7 million of the mandatorily convertible preferred stock at a purchase
price of $8.83 per share, convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of $4 million, and common equity of $3 million at a purchase price of $8.83 per share. the notes that were previously issued to employees to finance 50% of their
investment in ciri were assumed by indemnity as part of the agreement to purchase the employees investments in ciri. the excess of the cost to repurchase the minority interest over the minority interest carrying value on the consolidated
balance sheet was recorded as a charge to additional paid-in capital during the second quarter.   results of operations by segment   operating income in the following discussion represents net income excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses).   commercial   results of the companys commercial segment were as follows:

operating income of $862 million in 2004 declined $199 million, or 19%, from 2003, which did not include
the results of spc. included in 2004 results were $233 million of after-tax catastrophe losses, compared with after-tax catastrophe losses of $67 million in 2003. also impacting 2004 operating income was net after-tax unfavorable prior year reserve
development of $802 million ($1.18 billion, pretax), primarily related to asbestos and environmental reserve strengthening. net after-tax unfavorable prior year reserve development totaled $439 million in 2003.   total revenues of $11.11 billion in 2004 reflected growth of $2.12 billion in
earned premiums, which was primarily due to the merger and also reflected the earned premium effect of moderating renewal price increases over the last twelve months in the companys core commercial operations. in addition, incremental premiums
resulting from the renewal rights transaction with royal & sunalliance in the third quarter of 2003 contributed to premium growth in 2004.   net investment income in 2004 increased $384 million over 2003 due largely to the increase in invested assets as a result of the merger, strong
operational cash flows that contributed to the growth in invested assets over 2003, and investment income related to the initial public trading of an investment. also impacting net investment income was the effect of a decline in pretax investment
yields due to a higher proportion of tax-exempt investments, and lower yields on fixed income securities and alternative investments.   national accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services to large companies
that choose to self-insure a portion of their insurance risks, and claims and policy management services to workers compensation residual market pools, automobile assigned risk plans and to self-insurance pools. the strong increase in 2004 fee
income reflected higher new business levels, resulting, in part, from the third quarter 2003 renewal rights transaction with royal & sunalliance, renewal price increases and more workers compensation business being written by state
residual market pools.   claim and claim adjustment expenses in
2004 included $1.18 billion of net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the commercial segment, of which $927 million represented a provision to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result of the completion of the companys
annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter and $286 million represented a provision to strengthen environmental reserves. the asbestos provision primarily resulted from an increase in litigation costs and activity surrounding peripheral
defendants. with regard to the environmental provision, new claims for hazardous waste and pollution continue to decline, though the pace of the decrease has slowed. the average severity of claims has increased, however, leading the company to
conclude that reserves for environmental losses needed to be increased. in june 2004, the company decided to commute certain reinsurance agreements with a major reinsurer, resulting in a prior year reserve charge of $38 million. also included in net
unfavorable prior-year reserve development in the commercial segment in 2004 was a strengthening of gulf reserves, which was more than offset by favorable prior year reserve development in core commercial operations due to reductions in the
frequency of non-catastrophe related losses. in 2003, unfavorable prior-year loss development in the commercial segment totaled $676 million, the most significant component of which was $521 million of reserve strengthening in the gulf operations.
that reserve strengthening was primarily related to a line of business that insured the residual values of leased vehicles and that had been placed in runoff in late 2001, and the resolution of a residual value claim dispute.   also included in claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2004 were catastrophe
losses of $358 million, compared with catastrophe losses of $103 million in 2003. the losses in 2004 primarily resulted from the four hurricanes that made landfall in the southeastern united states in the third quarter, whereas the 2003 losses
resulted from a variety of storms throughout the year, including hurricane isabel.   other items increasing 2004 claims and expenses compared to 2003 include $72 million of charges to increase the allowances for estimated amounts due from reinsurance recoverables and policyholders receivables,
previously described in the consolidated overview section.

the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2004 included a 13.6 point impact from prior-year reserve
development and a 4.1 point impact from catastrophe losses. in 2003, the impacts of these factors on the loss and loss expense ratio were 10.3 points and 1.6 points, respectively. excluding those factors in both years, the adjusted loss and loss
expense ratio in 2004 of 62.3 was 1.2 points improved over the adjusted 2003 ratio of 63.5. the 3.3 point increase in the underwriting expense ratio in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily reflected the impact of the higher underwriting expense ratio of
the business acquired in the merger and operating expenses associated with commercial other (where premium volume declined significantly).   operating income of $1.06 billion in 2003 was a significant improvement over the operating loss of $310 million in 2002. operating results in 2003
reflected a favorable, but moderating, rate environment characterized by rate increases in excess of loss cost trends, and increased business volumes. after-tax catastrophe losses totaled $67 million in 2003, whereas in 2002 the commercial segment
incurred no catastrophes. the 2002 operating loss was driven by significant asbestos-related unfavorable prior-year reserve development.   earned premiums in 2003 grew $721 million, or 12%, over 2002, primarily due to premium rate increases, growth in targeted new business and strong customer
retention. the strong growth in 2003 earned premiums was partially offset by a $214 million decline in earned premiums at the northland subsidiaries that resulted from the withdrawal in 2002 of business at american equity insurance company and
commercial guaranty casualty insurance company. net investment income in 2003 increased $17 million over 2002 due to higher average invested assets resulting from strong cash flows from operations, partially offset by the reduction in average pretax
investment yields to 5.3% in 2003 from 6.0% in 2002. the decrease in yields reflected the lower interest rate environment, the shortening of the average effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, a higher proportion of tax-exempt
investments and reduced returns in the companys private equity investments; partially offset by higher returns in arbitrage fund investments. the $99 million, or 22%, increase in fee income in 2003 over 2002 reflected higher new business
levels, price increases and more workers compensation business being written by state residual market pools.   claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2003 decreased $2.23 billion, or 30%, primarily due to a significant decline in unfavorable prior year reserve
development, which was partially offset by an increase in catastrophe losses and increased loss costs resulting from growth in business volume. catastrophe losses totaled $103 million in 2003, compared with no catastrophe losses in 2002. catastrophe
losses in 2003 were primarily the result of a severe winter storm in colorado in the first quarter, severe storms in the second quarter in a number of southern and midwestern states and hurricane isabel in the third quarter. unfavorable prior year
reserve development included in claims and claim adjustment expenses was $676 million in 2003 compared to $3.12 billion in 2002. the most significant component of 2003 prior year development was the gulf reserve strengthening of $521 million
referred to previously. in addition to the gulf charges, unfavorable prior-year reserve development in 2003 included charges associated with american equity insurance company and an increase in environmental reserves. no asbestos-related prior year
reserve development was recorded in 2003. unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2002 included $2.95 billion of asbestos-related charges (prior to the benefit related to recoveries under the citigroup indemnification agreement). for
additional information see asbestos claims and litigation.   separately, the company strengthened its environmental reserves in the 2002 fourth quarter, which was mostly offset by reductions in its reserves for other general liability exposures. these actions were taken as a
result of payment and settlement experience. in addition, in 2003 the company strengthened prior year reserves for certain run-off lines of business, including assumed reinsurance, and experienced favorable development in certain on-going
businesses.   amortization of deferred acquisition costs
increased $82 million, or 9%, in 2003, reflecting higher commission and premium taxes associated with the increase in earned premiums. general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased $150 million, or 18%, over 2002, driven by business growth
and higher commission expense that resulted from improved underwriting results.

the 33.9 point improvement in the 2003 gaap loss and loss adjustment expense ratio over 2002 primarily
resulted from lower unfavorable prior year reserve development. the prior-year asbestos-related charges in 2002 added 36.8 points to that years loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, whereas in 2003 no prior-year asbestos-related charges were
incurred. the favorable impact of premium rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends in 2003 was largely offset by the impact of catastrophe losses. no catastrophe losses were incurred in 2002. the 0.6 point decrease in the underwriting expense
ratio in 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily due to the benefits of the favorable rate environment and higher fee income, largely offset by higher commissions that result from improved underwriting performance.   commercial net written premiums by market were as follows:

premiums in 2004 increased $1.35 billion, or 20%, over 2003, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. business retention rates remained strong and renewal price change increases moderated to the low-single digit levels in 2004. new business
volume declined, however, when compared with the combined new business volume of spc and tpc in 2003, reflecting the increasingly competitive marketplace and the impact of higher premium flow in 2003 associated with several renewal rights
transactions.   commercial accounts premium volume of
$4.21 billion in 2004 grew $960 million, or 30%, over 2003 volume of $3.25 billion, primarily due to the merger. retention rates remained strong and renewal price change increases were essentially flat by the end of the year. new business levels
moderated during the second half of 2004 as the benefit from the atlantic mutual and royal & sunalliance renewal rights transactions completed in the third quarter of 2003 diminished in the second half of the year.   select accounts 2004 premium volume of $2.56 billion increased $508
million, or 25%, over 2003, reflecting the impact of the merger. overall retention rates were strong and renewal price increases moderated to the mid single-digits. retention and growth were strongest in smaller, high transaction volume accounts,
reflecting the companys competitive advantage in agency automation, product offerings and service to agents.   the 13% increase in national accounts premium volume in 2004 reflected new business from the third-quarter 2003 royal & sunalliance renewal
rights transaction and higher business volumes in residual market pools, the impacts of which were partially offset by a shift to deductible and fee-based products by some of the companys clients.   in the commercial other business, the $226 million, or 31%, decline in 2004
premium volume compared with 2003 primarily reflected the placement of gulf operations in runoff in the second quarter of 2004. subsequently, certain business previously written by gulf is now being written in the commercial or specialty segments.
the runoff healthcare, reinsurance and international business acquired in the merger produced minimal written premium volume in 2004.   commercial net written premiums increased $532 million, or 8%, in 2003. renewal price increases, higher new business levels, and strong customer retention
across all major lines of business combined to drive premium growth over 2002. this premium growth was partially offset by the decrease in net written premiums at the northland subsidiaries due to the withdrawal in 2002 of business at certain of
those subsidiaries and a one-time

additional $115 million of net written premium in 2002 related to the termination of certain reinsurance contracts. net written premiums for the northland
subsidiaries were $547 million in 2003 compared to $825 million in 2002. the commercial business of those subsidiaries is included with commercial accounts.   commercial accounts net written premiums increased $100 million, or 3%, in 2003. net written premiums associated with the northland subsidiaries declined
to $547 million in 2003 from $825 million in 2002 due to the factors described above. excluding the northland subsidiaries net written premiums in both 2003 and 2002, commercial accounts premium volume in 2003 grew 16% over 2002. the increase
was primarily due to renewal price increases, new business growth in targeted markets and strong retention across all major product lines.   select accounts net written premiums in 2003 increased $178 million, or 10%, over 2002. the increase primarily reflected renewal price increases, new
business and strong retention. new business growth was especially strong in property, general liability and commercial multi-peril lines of business. select accounts retention levels in 2003 were strongest for small commercial business handled
through the companys service centers, while premium growth was centered in the commercial multi-peril and property product lines.   national accounts net written premiums in 2003 increased $190 million, or 30%, over 2002, primarily due to the continued benefit from rate increases,
higher new business levels that, in part, resulted from the companys third quarter 2003 renewal rights transaction with royal & sunalliance and higher business volume in residual market pools.   the commercial other sector of the commercial segment in 2003 and 2002
consisted primarily of results from the companys gulf subsidiary, which marketed products to national, mid-sized and small customers and distributed them through both wholesale brokers and retail agents and brokers throughout the united states
with particular emphasis on management and professional liability coverages and excess and surplus lines of insurance. gulf net written premiums increased $83 million, or 14%, in 2003 as a result of significant rate increases across all classes of
management liability products.   specialty   the specialty segments results for the twelve months ended december
31, 2004 reflect the results of tpcs bond and construction operations for the three months ended march 31, 2004 and the post-merger combined results of spcs specialty operations and tpcs bond and construction operations for the
nine months ended december 31, 2004. results for 2003 and 2002 represent tpcs bond and construction operations only.

the operating loss of
$724 million in 2004 was driven by after-tax unfavorable prior year reserve development of $1.03 billion ($1.59 billion, pretax) including $500 million and $300 million (pretax) of net unfavorable prior year loss development related to the
construction and surety reserves, respectively, acquired in

the merger as well as other net reserving actions that are described in the narrative that follows. in june 2004, the company decided to commute certain
reinsurance agreements with a major reinsurer, resulting in a prior year reserve charge of $75 million. operating results in 2004 also included $155 million of after-tax catastrophe losses resulting from the four hurricanes described previously,
whereas 2003 results included no catastrophe losses.   domestic
specialty earned premiums totaled $3.86 billion in 2004, compared with $1.17 billion in 2003. international specialty earned premiums in 2004 were $930 million, whereas 2003 results included minimal international premiums. the increases over 2003
were primarily driven by incremental premiums resulting from the merger, and also reflected the impact of price increases. net investment income increased $324 million over 2003 due to the increase in invested assets as a result of the merger. in
addition, strong operational cash flows contributed to the growth in invested assets over the same period of 2003. also impacting in net investment income is the effect of a decline in pretax investment yields due to a higher proportion of
tax-exempt investments and lower yields on fixed income securities and alternative investments.   the following discussion provides more information regarding the net unfavorable prior year loss development related to the construction and surety
reserves, acquired in the merger as well as other net reserving actions.   construction reserves   beginning on april 1, 2004, upon the completion of the merger of tpc and spc, personnel from the predecessor companies were able to share detailed policyholder information, claim files and actuarial data related to the acquired construction
reserves. this enabled an analysis to be performed in the second quarter of the acquired construction reserves using tpcs long-established practices that includes evaluating exposures by type of claim (e.g. construction defect, construction
wrap up, other), by type of coverage, (e.g. guaranteed cost, loss responsive, other) and by detailed line of business (general liability, commercial auto, etc.), among others. for general liability exposures, which include construction defect and
construction wrap-up, interpretation of underlying trends (both present and future) and the related reserve estimation process is highly judgmental due to the low frequency/high severity and complex nature of these exposures. in particular, for
construction defect, there is a high degree of uncertainty relating to whether coverage exists, when losses occur, the size of each loss, expectations for future interpretive rulings concerning contract provisions and the extent to which the
assertion of these claims will expand geographically. as a result, material variations can and do occur among actuarial reserve estimates for these types of exposures. in a merger, these differences are likely to be even more pronounced. prior to a
merger, each legacy company consistently applies its assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods to estimate reserves. differences between these assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods need to be understood and reconciled, and a uniform
approach needs to be adopted for the merged entity. in this situation, material adjustments can and do occur for reserves related to exposures having a high degree of uncertainty.    analysis of the acquired construction reserves was completed near the end of the second quarter of 2004. based upon the
results of this analysis, the company increased its estimate of the acquired net construction reserves by $500 million, including $400 million for construction defect and $100 million for construction wrap-up claims, and recognized this change in
estimate as an income statement charge in the second quarter. there was no reinsurance associated with this charge.   surety reserves   beginning on april 1, 2004, upon completion of the merger of tpc and spc, personnel from the predecessor companies were able to share the detailed spc
policyholder information, including underwriting, claim and actuarial files related to surety reserves. access to this detailed information enabled the company to perform a claim-by-claim review of reserves and claims handling strategies during the
second quarter of 2004 using the combined expertise of claims adjusters from the legacy companies. this type of review involves considerable judgment, especially with respect to the economic outlook within which claims will be settled,
table of contents
index to financial statements
estimates for dates of loss occurrence and evaluations of ibnr exposures for each insured. for example, as a result of the detailed information obtained
concerning contractors with reported claims, the company considered whether or not losses were incurred but not yet reported on one or more additional projects for each contractor examined.   also on april 1, 2004, the company could begin to use this detailed
information to compare spcs assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods that were underlying the acquired reserves with its own assumptions, judgments and actuarial methods. similarities and differences were found to exist. similarities
included, but were not limited to, recognizing claim reserves when it was determined that contractors and commercial surety insureds were in default and thereby unable to meet their obligations, estimating initial ibnr provisions, and periodically
re-evaluating, at least quarterly, the adequacy of the reserves established based on actual claims recorded and revised estimates of ibnr. differences included judgments and methods related to determining ibnr development factors and expected
salvage, among others.   that these differences exist is not
unusual for surety reserve estimates. surety is a line of business for which there are low frequency, high severity, very complex claims for certain exposures, particularly those related to large construction contractors and commercial surety
insureds. determining the date of loss in these circumstances requires a high degree of judgment. in addition, the claim reserve estimates even for reported claims are also highly judgmental. these two factors, among others, combine to make ibnr
reserve estimations for surety extremely difficult. due to this high degree of uncertainty, the informed judgments of different actuaries could and do vary materially. as discussed above, in a merger, these differences are likely to be even more
pronounced.   the claim reviews and actuarial analyses were both
completed near the end of the second quarter of 2004. based upon the results of these reviews and analyses, the company increased its estimate of the acquired net surety reserves by $300 million, net of $170 million of reinsurance, and recognized
this change in estimate as an income statement charge in the second quarter.   prior to the merger and beginning in the third quarter of 2003, spc disclosed that a large construction contractor for which it had written several surety bonds was experiencing financial difficulty. based upon an
analysis of the financial condition of the construction contractor that was performed in the third quarter of 2003, a restructuring plan was adopted by the construction contractor, its banks, and spc, among others, as a means to minimize estimated
losses. spc monitored the progress of the construction contractor toward meeting the requirements of the restructuring plan throughout subsequent quarters. spc also estimated and disclosed its estimated ultimate net losses related to this exposure,
beginning in the third quarter of 2003 and updated each quarter thereafter, including the effects of advances made or expected to be made to the construction contractor, applicable collateral, co-surety participations and reinsurance. the size and
complexity of these particular construction contracts, coupled with the deteriorating credit quality of the construction contractor and the inherent uncertainty as to whether it would meet the obligations of the restructuring plan, resulted in a
high degree of judgment in estimating potential losses.   a
comprehensive analysis that began in the first quarter of 2004 was completed during the last half of the second quarter. based upon this analysis, the company concluded that the contractor would not be able to meet the targets set forth in its
business and restructuring plans. therefore, the company moved from supporting the contractors restructuring plan to adopting a workout plan as a means to minimize estimated losses. under the workout plan, the company would no longer provide
additional surety bonds for new projects of the construction contractor. also as part of the workout plan, the company was able to implement additional accounting and engineering procedures for each open project, which included using specialists to
implement additional forecasting, cash management, and reporting procedures, on both a project-by-project and consolidated level. based upon this second quarter change to a workout plan and the detailed financial analysis that was able to be
performed, the company increased its estimate of the ultimate net loss by $252 million, including $9 million of reinsurance. this estimate took into consideration paid amounts, net receivables, liquidated damages, overhead

index to financial statements
costs, additional completion costs, including costs associated with replacing the contractor, receivable discounts, current and future claims from owners and
subcontractors against the contractor, and the value of collateral, among others.   also during the last half of the second quarter of 2004, a participating co-surety on this exposure announced that insurance regulators had approved its submitted run-off plan. based upon industrys knowledge of
the co-suretys run-off plan and the companys analysis of its financial condition, the company concluded that it was unlikely to collect the full amount projected to be owed by the co-surety and established an appropriate level of
reserves.   claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2004 included
$225 million of catastrophe losses, compared with no such losses in 2003. results in 2004 also reflected increased current year loss provisions on portions of the bond and construction books of business, and $150 million of unfavorable prior year
reserve development recorded in tpcs construction operation prior to the merger. excluding the impact of catastrophes, the majority of the remaining markets comprising this segment recorded strong underwriting results, driven by favorable
current year loss experience.   other items increasing 2004
claims and expenses compared to 2003 include $224 million of charges to increase the allowances for estimated amounts due from reinsurance recoverables, policyholders receivables, and a co-surety on a specific construction contractor claim
previously described in the consolidated overview section.   the
combined ratio in 2004 included a 33.1 point impact of unfavorable prior year reserve development and a 4.8 impact of catastrophe losses. the impact of both items in 2003 was negligible.   the $50 million increase in operating earnings in 2003 over 2002 reflected strong results from the companys bond
operation. the $201 million, or 21%, increase in earned premiums over 2002 primarily resulted from premium rate increases, growth in targeted new business and strong customer retention. the $5 million decline in net investment income in 2003
primarily reflected a reduction in pretax investment yields from 6.0% in 2002 to 5.3% in 2003.   claims and expenses in 2003 included unfavorable prior year reserve development totaling $12 million, compared with unfavorable development of $3 million in 2002.   the 5.3 point improvement in the combined ratio in 2003 reflected the impact
of price increases, higher new business volumes and controlled expense growth.   specialty net written premiums by market were as follows:

the $3.54 billion
increase in net written premium volume over 2003 reflected the impact of the merger. however, the repositioning of the bond and construction books of business primarily accounted for a decline in net written premium volume in 2004 compared with the
2003 combined premium volume of spc and tpc. in construction, that repositioning resulted in reduced retention levels when compared with 2003, and new business

levels also declined substantially. in bond, the repositioning of the book of business was primarily centered in the spc business acquired in the merger.
net written premiums in 2004 in the majority of the
companys remaining domestic specialty businesses were strong, with retention levels at or above historical levels. the company continued to focus on retaining the profitable and well-priced book of business that has been built in recent years.
renewal price change increases in these operations moderated throughout the year to the upper single-digit level. new business levels in 2004 were down compared with 2003, when renewal rights transactions contributed to strong growth in new
business. the impact of the decline in new business levels in 2004 was partially offset by premium growth resulting from the transfer of certain business from the companys gulf operation, which was placed in runoff in the second quarter of the
year. in addition, premium volume in these domestic businesses benefited in 2004 from a small amount of additional transfers of certain business previously written in the commercial segments commercial accounts operation.   in international specialty, acquired in the merger, business retention levels
(excluding lloyds) were strong relative to pre-merger levels. new business levels were consistent with 2003, while the rate of renewal price change increases moderated to the lowsingle digit levels. the company continued to focus on
retaining its profitable book of existing international specialty business. at lloyds, premium volume was negatively impacted by the planned non-renewal of certain personal lines insurance coverages.   the $218 million, or 21%, increase in net written premiums in 2003 over 2002
reflected a favorable premium rate environment and strong new business, particularly in bonds executive liability lines.   personal   results of the companys personal segment were as follows:

$939 million in 2004 increased $447 million over 2003. the significant improvement in 2004 was driven by historically low loss frequency levels, particularly in the property line, after-tax favorable prior year reserve development of $246 million,
an increase in investment income, and strong premium growth reflecting the impact of unit growth and price increases.   the $758 million, or 16%, growth in earned premiums over 2003 was primarily due to an increase in organic new business volume, new business associated
with the royal & sunalliance renewal rights transaction completed in the third quarter of 2003, continued strong business retention levels and renewal price increases. net investment income in 2004 grew 22% over 2003, driven by strong

quarter of the year. also impacting net investment income in 2004 was the effect of a decline in pretax investment yields resulting from a higher proportion
of tax-exempt investments, and generally lower yields on fixed-income securities purchased during the year.   claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2004 included $378 million of favorable prior-year reserve development, primarily driven by a decline in the
frequency of non-catastrophe related homeowners losses, as well as an improvement in the frequency and severity trends in the automobile line of business. in 2003, favorable prior-year reserve development totaled $212 million, also primarily
due to a decline in the frequency of non-catastrophe related homeowners losses. the 2003 total included a $50 million reduction in the provision for losses resulting from the september 11, 2001 terrorist attack. in addition, claim and claim
adjustment expenses in 2004 reflected the benefit of lower current accident year frequency of non-catastrophe claims in the homeowners line of business than in 2003. claims and expenses in 2004 included catastrophe losses of $189 million,
compared with catastrophe losses of $249 million in 2003. the 2004 losses were primarily the result of the four hurricanes described previously, whereas the 2003 losses resulted from a variety of storms across the united states, including hurricane
isabel in the third quarter of the year and wildfires in california. claims and expenses in 2004 also reflected continued investments in process re-engineering pilots targeted to improve loss severity.   the amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled $941 million in 2004,
an 18% increase over the 2003 total of $800 million. the increase was due to higher commission and premium taxes associated with the increases in earned premium previously described, as well as a change in product mix. general and administrative
expenses of $536 million in 2004 were 28% higher than comparable expenses of $420 million in 2003, primarily due to business growth, higher commission expense related to improved underwriting results and investments in personnel, technology and
infrastructure to support business growth and product development.   the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2004 reflected a 6.8 point favorable impact from prior-year reserve development, compared with a favorable prior-year impact of 4.4 points on the 2003 ratio. catastrophe losses accounted for 3.4
points and 5.2 points of the 2004 and 2003 ratios, respectively. in addition to these factors, the significant improvement in the 2004 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio reflected the earned impact of price increases that continued to exceed
loss cost trends. the 1.2 point increase in the underwriting expense ratio reflected the investments described previously, as well as the impact of higher commission expenses related to improved underwriting results.   operating income in 2003 increased $145 million, or 42%, over 2002. operating
income in 2003 benefited from a favorable, but moderating, premium rate environment in both automobile and property, increased business volumes and a continued moderation in the increase in loss costs.   earned premiums increased $468 million, or 11%, in 2003, primarily due to
higher rates, growth in new business volumes and strong retention levels. net investment income in 2003 decreased $24 million compared with 2002, despite an increase in average invested assets resulting from strong operational cash flows. the
decline resulted from a reduction in pretax investment yields, which reflected a lower interest rate environment, the shortening of the average effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, a higher proportion of tax-exempt investments and
slightly lower returns from the companys private equity investments.   claim and claim adjustment expenses in 2003 included favorable prior-year reserve development of $212 million, compared with favorable development of $30 million in 2002. the favorable development in 2003 resulted
from improvement in non-catastrophe-related claim frequency for both homeowners and non-bodily-injury automobile businesses, and a $50 million reduction in reserves related to the terrorist attack on september 11, 2001 (also due to lower than
expected claim frequency). catastrophe losses of $249 million in 2003 were significantly higher than comparable losses of $84 million in 2002. catastrophe losses in both years were driven by numerous storms across the united states. losses in 2003
also reflected the impact of hurricane isabel and wildfires in california.

the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, which totaled $800 million in 2003, increased $63
million, or 9%, over 2002 due to higher commission and premium taxes associated with the increases in earned premium previously described. general and administrative expenses in 2003 also increased 9% over 2002, driven by business growth and higher
commissions that resulted from improved underwriting results.   the 4.5 point improvement in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio over 2002 was due to renewal price increases that exceeded loss cost trends, continued reduced levels of non-catastrophe property claim frequency and higher favorable
prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher catastrophes.   personal net written premiums by product line were as follows:

in 2004 increased 17% over 2003. both automobile and homeowners and other net written premiums increased in 2004 due to higher organic new business volumes, the impact of new business associated with the royal & sunalliance renewal rights
transaction completed in the third quarter of 2003, continued strong retention, and renewal price increases. the personal segment had approximately 6.1 million, 5.4 million and 5.2 million policies in force at december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.   in the automobile line of business, policies in
force at december 31, 2004 increased 9% over 2003. policies in force in the homeowners and other line of business at december 31, 3004 increased by 15% over 2003. effective in the first quarter of 2004, homeowners and other policies in force exclude
certain endorsements to homeowners policies previously considered separate policies in force. policy totals for 2003 and 2002 were restated to conform to the 2004 presentation.   automobile net written premiums in 2003 increased $211 million, or 7%, over 2002 due to higher business volumes and renewal
price increases. policies in force at december 31, 2003 increased 4% over 2002.   homeowners and other net written premiums increased $295 million, or 17%, in 2003 due to higher business volumes and renewal price increases. policies in force increased 6% in 2003.   asset management   nuveen investments key financial data were as follows:

net after-tax expense
for interest expense and other for the year ended december 31, 2004 increased $70 million compared with 2003, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. included in the increase was $46 million of incremental interest expense on debt assumed in
the merger. that amount was net of the favorable impact of $36 million of the amortization of the fair value adjustment related to debt recorded at the acquisition date. the 2004 total also included $9 million of charges related to the merger that
were recorded in the second quarter.   interest expense and
other in 2003 increased $9 million, after tax, primarily due to higher interest costs. after-tax interest expense was $105 million in 2003 compared to $100 million in 2002. the increase in interest expense in 2003 was primarily due to certain one
time costs associated with the first and second quarter refinancing activities that lowered average interest costs, but resulted in higher levels of temporary debt. temporary financing included $550 million first obtained in december 2002 in
connection with the fourth quarter 2002 asbestos reserve strengthening and $1.40 billion of senior notes issued on march 11, 2003. the proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used to prepay and refinance a $500 million note to
citigroup on march 11, 2003, and to redeem $900 million of trust preferred securities on april 9, 2003. for additional information see liquidity and capital resources.   asbestos claims and litigation   the company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have attempted to expand
insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the intent of insurers and policyholders. as a result, the company continues to experience a significant number of asbestos claims being tendered to the company by the companys policyholders
(which includes others seeking coverage under a policy) including claims against the companys policyholders by individuals who do not appear to be impaired by asbestos exposure. factors underlying these increases include more intensive
advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants, the increasing focus by plaintiffs on new and previously peripheral defendants and entities seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities. in addition to contributing to
the increase in claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the
company. bankruptcy proceedings are also causing increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in the tort system. recently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can
present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation have their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. this trend,
along with the focus on new and previously peripheral defendants, contributes to the increase in loss and loss expense payments experienced by the company. in addition, the company sees, as an emerging trend, an increase in the companys
asbestos-related
table of contents
index to financial statements
loss and loss expense experience as a result of the exhaustion or unavailability due to insolvency of other insurance potentially available to policyholders
along with the insolvency or bankruptcy of other defendants. the company is currently involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders who have filed for bankruptcy, including, among others, acands, inc., who in some instances
have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage as described generally in the next paragraph. (also see part iitem 3, legal proceedings). these trends are
expected to continue through 2005. as a result of the factors described above, there is a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims.   in some instances, policyholders continue to assert that their claims for asbestos-related insurance are not subject to
aggregate limits on coverage and that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy. it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues or whether the company
will be successful in asserting additional defenses. to the extent both issues are resolved in policyholders favor and other additional company defenses are not successful, the companys coverage obligations under the policies at issue
would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. accordingly, it is difficult to predict the ultimate cost of the claims for coverage
not subject to aggregate limits.   many coverage disputes with
policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive
releases which are favorable to the company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. as in the past, the company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.   in addition, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers,
including the company, challenging insurers conduct in respect of asbestos claims, and, as discussed below, claims by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. the company anticipates the filing of
other direct actions against insurers, including the company, in the future. it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal
theories of liability. the company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions. additionally, tpc has entered into settlement agreements, which have been approved by the court in
connection with the proceedings initiated by tpc in the johns manville bankruptcy court. if the rulings of the bankruptcy court are affirmed through the appellate process, then tpc will have resolved substantially all of the pending claims against
it of this nature. (also, see item 3legal proceedings).   because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the company generally evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder on a policyholder-by-policyholder basis. in the course of this
evaluation, the company considers: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of each policyholders potential liability;
the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of
non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim
subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. when the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and related claim adjustment expense is determined for a policyholder, the company calculates, by each policy year, a
ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, past ceded experience and reinsurance collections. conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves. the companys
evaluations have not resulted in any data from which a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment may be determined.   the company also compares its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or
characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. net asbestos

losses and expenses paid in 2004 were $301 million, compared with $452 million in 2003. approximately 22% in 2004 and 57% in 2003 of total net paid losses
relate to policyholders with whom the company previously entered into settlement agreements that would limit the companys liability. the decrease in the percentage of net paid settlements to total paid losses in 2004 primarily reflected an
increase in reinsurance billings in 2004, which related to gross payments made in prior periods. in 2004, gross payments associated with policyholders with settlement agreements totaled $199 million, compared with $289 million in 2003.
at december 31, 2004, net asbestos reserves totaled $3.93 billion,
compared with $2.98 billion at december 31, 2003. the company acquired $311 million of net asbestos reserves in the merger with spc. net incurred asbestos losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $928 million in 2004, driven by a $922 million
provision to strengthen reserves in the fourth quarter following completion of the companys annual ground-up review of asbestos exposures. that review included an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as
well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, state judicial rulings and legislative actions. the $922 million provision primarily resulted from an increase in litigation costs and activity surrounding peripheral defendants.   the company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows (the increase in

data for 2004 includes international exposures acquired in merger   the policyholders with settlement agreements category includes structured agreements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to tpc, wellington
accounts and the settlement of the statutory and hawaii actions and the common law claims (for a fuller description of these matters, see item 3legal proceedings) (collectively the direct action settlement). reserves
are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. structured agreements are arrangements under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times. structured
agreements include the companys obligations related to ppg industries, inc. (ppg). in may 2002 the company agreed along with approximately three dozen other insurers and ppg on key terms to settle asbestos related coverage litigation under
insurance policies issued to ppg. this settlement is to be incorporated into the plan of reorganization (the plan) proposed as part of the pittsburgh corning (pc) bankruptcy proceeding. there remain a number of contingencies to consummation of the
settlement including the final execution of documents, court approval of the pc plan over pending objections, approval of the settlement and possible appeals. pursuant to the proposed pc plan, pc along with enumerated affiliated companies (including
ppg and corning) are to receive the protections afforded by section 524(g) of the bankruptcy code from certain asbestos related bodily injury claims. a recent ruling by the third circuit court of appeals in the in re combustion engineering,
inc. (ce) matter may impact the scope of relief that is potentially available to the debtor and other plan proponents. as a result, the pc bankruptcy court has sought additional briefing on the impact of the ce decision on the proposed
table of contents
index to financial statements
pc plan. oral argument is scheduled to take place on march 16, 2005. the company cannot predict what effect the ce decision may have with respect to the
bankruptcy courts approval of the current plan. the company believes that completion of the settlement is reasonably likely although it is not possible to predict how or when the bankruptcy court will rule on the outstanding objections or how
an appellate court may rule in the event of an appeal. it is possible that the companys single payment contribution pursuant to the proposed settlement of approximately $395 million after reinsurance will be made in calendar year 2005.
coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with major policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. wellington
accounts refer to the 35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. many of the aspects of the wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place
arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. as more fully described in item 3, legal proceedings, tpc has entered into the direct action settlement which is
still subject to a number of contingencies. if those contingencies are met, then tpc will pay up to $502 million, possibly in calendar year 2005. one of the contingencies includes affirmance by all appellate courts of the orders entered by the
united states bankruptcy court with respect to the direct action settlement. it is not possible to predict how or when the appellate courts will rule on the pending appeals. ten new policyholders were added to the policyholders with settlement
agreements category during 2004, including seven resulting from the acquisition of spc. during the course of 2004, the company made final payments to four policyholders, including one that arose during the year.   other policyholders with active claims are identified as home office review
or field office review policyholders. policyholders are identified for home office review based upon, among other factors: aggregate ultimate expected payments in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure,
number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential non-product exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. during 2004, there were 285 policyholders
added to the home office review. the acquisition of spc accounted for 222 of those policyholders, while the tpc count increased by 63. paid losses for policyholders in the home office review category increased by $30 million during the year,
primarily due to the addition of the spc policyholders to this category. accounts under field office review increased by 444 policyholders over year-end 2003. the acquisition of spc accounted for 516 of those policyholders, while the tpc count was
reduced by 72.   assumed reinsurance exposure primarily consists
of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations. the companys international operations are exposed to u.s. asbestos liabilities through participations in excess insurance policies, quota share and excess of loss
reinsurance policies, and retrocession policies, underwritten in the london insurance market. details of exposures under the reinsurance and retrocession policies are identified only when the company is advised by the retrocedant.   in addition to incurred but not reported (ibnr), amounts contained in the
reserves for specific policyholders or groups of policyholders described above, the company has established an unallocated ibnr reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders, new claims from policyholders reporting claims
for the first time and policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation and direct actions against the company. during 2004, reclassification of reserves to policyholders with settlement agreements resulted in a reduction in the
unallocated ibnr reserve of $595 million. the direct action settlement accounted for $502 million of this reclassification.

includes $800 million related to incurred asbestos losses subject to the citigroup indemnification agreement in 2002.   see uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental
reserves.   environmental claims and litigation   the company continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that
they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. for instance, the comprehensive
environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous
substances. this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. liability under cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties.
the company has been, and continues to be, involved in
litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. the company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. these
decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the company prior to the mid-1970s. these decisions continue
table of contents
index to financial statements
to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the
claimant from the policyholder, and the company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.   at december 31, 2004, approximately 71% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $456 million) is carried in a bulk reserve and includes unresolved
and incurred but not reported environmental claims for which the company has not received any specific claims as well as for the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. the balance, approximately 29% of the net
environmental reserve (approximately $185 million), consists of case reserves. the bulk reserve the company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the companys experience in
resolving those claims.   the resolution of environmental
exposures by the company generally occurs by settlement on a policyholder-by-policyholder basis as opposed to a claim-by-claim basis. generally, the company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the
policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder. this form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy-back of policies for future
environmental liability. in addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the company may have for other claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. the company and its
policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any future liability arising from known specified sites or claims. provisions of these agreements also include appropriate indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the company.
the companys general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the companys potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs.   in establishing environmental reserves, the company evaluates the exposure
presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. in the course of this analysis, the company considers the probable liability, available coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar
exposures. in addition, the company considers the many variables presented, such as the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the allegations of environmental harm at each site; the number of sites; the total number of
potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of
the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage,
including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims, in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. conventional actuarial techniques are not used to
estimate these reserves.   there have been judicial
interpretations that, in some cases, have been unfavorable to the industry and the company. additionally, payments for loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses have increased over past years. in its review of environmental reserves, the company
considered: the adequacy of reserves for past settlements; changing judicial and legislative trends; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up action for both on- and off-site waste disposal activities; the
potential for adverse development and additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements. based on these trends, developments and management judgment, the company increased its ibnr reserves
accordingly. in 2004, the company recorded a pretax charge of $290 million, net of reinsurance, to increase environmental reserves due to revised estimates of costs related to recent settlement initiatives.   the duration of the companys investigation and review of these claims
and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. these factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of
the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes, the pace of
table of contents
index to financial statements
coverage litigation between the policyholder and the company and the willingness of the policyholder and the company to negotiate, if appropriate, a
resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and policyholder-by-policyholder, the company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim. however, based upon the
companys experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several years.   the companys review of policyholders tendering claims for the first time has indicated that they are lower in severity. these policyholders
generally present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. further, regulatory agencies are utilizing risk-based analysis and more efficient clean-up technologies. however, the company has experienced an increase in the
anticipated settlement amounts of certain matters as well as an increase in loss adjustment expenses.   the following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves:

uncertainty regarding adequacy of
asbestos and environmental reserves   as a result of the
processes and procedures described above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims at december 31, 2004 are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and managements judgment.
however, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject to
revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by
various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims which cannot now be anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued, the resolution or
adjudication of some disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos claims in a manner inconsistent with
table of contents
index to financial statements
the companys previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the company and future developments pertaining to
the companys ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims. in addition, the company sees, as an emerging trend, an increase in the companys asbestos-related loss and loss expense experience as a result of the
exhaustion or unavailability due to insolvency of other insurance potentially available to policyholders along with the insolvency or bankruptcy of other defendants. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment
and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. this development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. it is also difficult to predict the
ultimate outcome of large coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in
bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos reserves, which includes an annual ground-up review of asbestos
policyholders, the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments. the company completed the annual ground-up review, which included the asbestos liabilities acquired in the merger, during the fourth quarter of 2004.
also see item 3legal proceedings.   because of
the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, the companys estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or
increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the companys operating results and financial condition in future periods.   investment portfolio   the companys invested assets at december 31, 2004 totaled $64.71 billion, including $477 million of securities in
process of settlement, of which 92% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in common stocks and other equity securities, 1% in mortgage loans and real estate and 6% in other investments. excluding the impact on invested assets
of securities lending, unrealized investment gains and losses, receivables for investment sales and payables on investment purchases, the pretax average yield was 4.8%, 5.3% and 6.0% and the after tax average yield was 3.7%, 4.0% and 4.4% for the
years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.   because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the company employs a conservative investment philosophy. the companys fixed maturity portfolio at december 31, 2004 totaled $54.26 billion,
comprising $53.93 billion of publicly traded fixed maturities and $328 million of private fixed maturities. the weighted average quality ratings of the companys publicly traded fixed maturity portfolio and private fixed maturity portfolio at
december 31, 2004 were aa2 and a3, respectively. included in the fixed maturity portfolio at that date was approximately $1.78 billion of below investment grade securities. during 2004, holdings of tax-exempt securities were increased to $26.58
billion to take advantage of their relatively high credit quality and attractive after-tax yields. the average effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, was 4.1 years as of december 31, 2004 (4.4 years
excluding short-term investments), unchanged from december 31, 2003.

the company makes
investments in collateralized mortgage obligations (cmos) that typically have high credit quality, offer good liquidity, and are expected to provide an advantage in yield compared to u.s. treasury securities. the companys investment strategy
is to purchase cmo tranches which offer the most favorable return given the risks involved. one significant risk evaluated is prepayment sensitivity. while prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration) and its effect on total return
cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the investment process generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges. the company does invest in other types of cmo tranches if
a careful assessment indicates a favorable risk/return tradeoff. the company does not purchase residual interests in cmos.   at december 31, 2004 and 2003, the company held cmos classified as available for sale with a fair value of $3.30 billion and $3.06 billion, respectively
(excluding commercial mortgage-backed securities of $953 million and $875 million, respectively). approximately 53% and 60% of the companys cmo holdings are guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by gnma, fnma or fhlmc at
december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. in addition, the company held $4.66 billion and $3.80 billion of gnma, fnma, fhlmc or fha mortgage-backed pass-through securities classified as available for sale at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
virtually all of these securities are rated aaa.   the
companys other investments are primarily comprised of venture capital, through direct ownership and limited partnerships, private equity limited partnerships, joint ventures, other limited partnerships and trading securities, which are subject
to more volatility than the companys fixed income investments, but historically have provided a higher return. at december 31, 2004, the carrying value of the companys other investments was $3.56 billion.   impairment charges included in net realized investment gains (losses) were as

evaluate current developments in the market that have the potential to affect the valuation of the companys investments.
$10 million in its real estate and other holdings. the losses recorded were the result of falling rental rates and occupancies in three of the companys real estate investment
holdings.   the company recognized

securities, the amounts of the impairments were recognized by writing down the investments to quoted market prices. for non-publicly traded securities, impairments are recognized by writing down the investment to its estimated fair value, as

the company believes
that the prices of the securities identified above were temporarily depressed primarily as a result of market dislocation and generally poor cyclical economic conditions. further, unrealized losses as of december 31, 2004 represent less than 1% of
the portfolio, and, therefore, any impact on the companys financial position would not be significant.   at december 31, 2004, non-investment grade securities comprised 3% of the companys fixed income investment portfolio. included in those categories
at december 31, 2004 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $321 million and a fair value of $314 million, resulting in a net pretax unrealized loss of $7 million. these securities in an
unrealized loss position represented less than 1% of the total amortized cost and less than 1% of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio at december 31, 2004, and accounted for 3% of the total pretax unrealized loss in the fixed income
portfolio.

resulting purchases
and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. the company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the
companys ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations.   outlook   the companys strategic objective is to enhance its position as a consistently profitable market leader and a cost-effective provider of property and casualty insurance in the united states. a variety of factors
continue to affect the property and casualty insurance market and the companys core business outlook for 2005, including the moderating level of price increases in the commercial marketplace, the increasing competitive environment across all
of the companys businesses, loss cost trends (including medical inflation and auto loss costs), asbestos-related developments and rising reinsurance and litigation costs.   the company expects market conditions in the property casualty insurance sector to continue to be quite competitive
throughout 2005. commercial pricing at the end of 2004 had declined to the low single-digit range and may turn negative in 2005 for certain products in some markets. in general, the pricing environment in the specialty segment is expected to be
better than in commercial, largely due to the specialized nature of the specialty businesses. within personal, the company expects to see increased price competition in the auto segment, while the homeowners segment is expected to remain stable.
the industry has experienced unprecedented low levels of claim
frequency over the last several years, a trend that is not expected to change materially in 2005. severity trend, the other component of loss trend, is expected to continue to remain stable. nevertheless, with continued pressure on pricing, it is
likely that margins will contract in certain parts of the companys business in 2005, albeit from very strong levels.   changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new investments. while a rising interest rate environment enhances the
returns available on new fixed income investments, it reduces the market value of existing fixed maturity investments and the availability of gains on disposition. a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but
increases the market value of existing investments and the availability of realized investment gains on disposition. in 2004, interest rates began to increase after reaching their lowest levels since the 1950s in 2003. consequently, yields
available on new investments began to grow, but remained below the existing portfolios average book yield. the continuation of an upward trend in interest rates in 2005 would favorably impact the average book yield of the companys fixed
income holdings.   in january 2005, the company announced that
it will explore strategic alternatives to divest its majority ownership position in nuveen investments, thereby providing the company with the opportunity to increase its financial flexibility.   the company expects to realize its targeted merger-related cumulative expense
savings of $350 million by the end of 2005 and $450 million by the end of 2006. a portion of these savings are expected be redeployed to support growth in the companys business segments and investments in technology.

as required by various state laws and regulations, the companys insurance subsidiaries are subject
to assessments from state-administered guaranty associations, second-injury funds and similar associations. in the opinion of the companys management, these assessments will not have a material impact on the companys results of
operations.   some social, economic, political and litigation
issues have led to an increased number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at addressing the cost and availability of some types of insurance as well as the claim and coverage obligations of insurers. while most of these provisions have
failed to become law, these initiatives may continue as legislators and regulators try to respond to public availability, affordability and claim concerns and the resulting laws, if any, could adversely affect the companys ability to write
business with appropriate returns.   on november 26, 2002, the
terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 (the terrorism act) was enacted into federal law and established the terrorism insurance program (the program), a temporary federal program in the department of the treasury, that provides for a system of shared
public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest. in order for a loss to be covered under the program (subject losses), the loss must be the result of an event
that is certified as an act of terrorism by the u.s. secretary of treasury. in the case of a war declared by congress, only workers compensation losses are covered by the terrorism act. the terrorism act generally requires that all commercial
property casualty insurers licensed in the united states participate in the program. the program terminates on december 31, 2005. under the program, a participating insurer is entitled to be reimbursed by the federal government for 90% of subject
losses, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap. in each case, the deductible percentage is applied to the insurers direct earned premiums from the calendar year immediately preceding the applicable year. the deductible under the
program was 7% for 2003, 10% for 2004 and is 15% for 2005. the program also contains an annual cap that limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100 billion. once subject losses have reached the $100 billion
aggregate during a program year, there is no additional reimbursement from the u.s. treasury and an insurer that has met its deductible for the program year is not liable for any losses (or portion thereof) that exceed the $100 billion cap. the
companys estimated deductible under this federal program is $2.51 billion for 2005. the company had no terrorism-related losses in 2004 or 2003. if the program is not renewed for periods after january 1, 2006, the benefits of the program will
not be available to the company, and the company will be subject to losses from acts of terrorism subject only to the terms and provisions of applicable policies.   while the terrorism act provides a federally-funded backstop for commercial property casualty insurers, it also
requires that insurers immediately begin offering coverage for insured losses caused by acts of terrorism. the majority of the companys commercial and specialty policies already included such coverage, although exclusions were added to
higher-risk policyholders after september 11, 2001. for those risks considered higher-risk, such as landmark buildings or high concentrations of employees in one location, the company will continue to either decline to offer a renewal or will offer
coverage for losses caused by acts of terrorism on a limited basis, with an explicit charge for the coverage.    there are currently various state and federal legislative and judicial proposals to require asbestos claimants to demonstrate an asbestos illness. at this
time it is not possible to predict the likelihood or timing of such proposals being enacted or the effect if they are enacted. the companys ongoing analysis of its asbestos reserves did not assume the adoption of any asbestos reforms. for
information about the outlook with respect to asbestos-related claims and liabilities see asbestos claims and litigation and uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves.   transactions with former affiliate   see notes 3 and 18 of notes to the companys consolidated financial

liquidity and capital resources   liquidity is a measure of a companys ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash
requirements of its business operations. the liquidity requirements of the companys business have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, asset maturities and income received on investments. cash provided from these sources is
used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. catastrophe claims, the timing and amount of which are inherently unpredictable, may create increased liquidity requirements. the timing and amount of
reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and increasingly by reinsurance coverage disputes. additionally, recent increases in asbestos-related claim payments, as well as potential judgments and settlements arising out of
litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. in the opinion of the companys management, the companys future liquidity needs will be met from all of the above sources.   net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $5.24 billion, $3.83
billion and $2.93 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. cash flows in 2004 included $867 million in cash proceeds received pursuant to the commutation of specific reinsurance agreements in the second quarter described previously. cash flows
in 2004 also benefited from premium rate and volume increases. the previously discussed adjustments recorded in the second quarter did not materially impact year-to-date 2004 cash flows. the company utilized $550 million of net operating loss
carryforwards (nol) during 2004, thereby reducing current regular tax payments by $193 million. at december 31, 2004, the company had significant nols available to offset future taxable income. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements
for further information regarding nols.   net cash flows
provided by operating activities in 2003 benefited from premium rate increases and the receipt of $361 million from citigroup related to recoveries under the asbestos indemnification agreement in the first quarter of 2003 and $531 million of federal
income taxes refunded from the companys net operating loss carryback.   net cash flows provided by operating activities for all three years were negatively impacted by payments for asbestos and environmental liabilities and, in 2004, for reinsurance, health care and certain international
runoff operations. included in the companys structured agreement component of asbestos loss reserves at december 31, 2004 was $395 million (net of reinsurance) for the companys single payment contribution to the proposed settlement
related to ppg, and $502 million for the companys settlement of the statutory and hawaii actions and the common law claims. although each of these settlements is subject to certain contingencies or final orders and relief as previously
discussed, it is possible that these settlement amounts will be paid in 2005.   net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $4.79 billion, $2.48 billion and $2.27 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the increase in 2004 corresponds to the increase in operational cash flows,
which were invested predominantly in fixed maturity securities. in 2003, cash used in investing activities was partly offset by sales of securities to fund net payment activity related to debt and junior subordinated debt securities held by
subsidiary trusts of $772 million. the 2002 net cash flows used in investing activities principally reflected investing of net cash from operating activities and the receipt of $4.09 billion from the first quarter 2002 initial public offering and
the concurrent issuance of $867 million of convertible notes payable, partially offset by the repayment of $6.35 billion of notes payable to a former affiliate.
the majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality intermediate-term taxable u.s.
government, corporate and mortgage backed bonds and tax-exempt u.s. municipal bonds. the company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate
funds available to satisfy the companys insurance and debt obligations. the companys management of the duration of the fixed income investment portfolio generally produces a duration that exceeds the duration of the companys net
insurance liabilities. as the companys investment strategy focuses on asset and liability durations, and not specific cash flows, asset sales may be required to satisfy obligations and/or rebalance asset portfolios. the average duration of
fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.1 years as of december 31, 2004, unchanged from december 31, 2003.

the company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, venture capital and real estate.
these investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also involve varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.   the primary goal of the companys asset liability management process is to satisfy the insurance liabilities and manage
the interest rate risk embedded in those insurance liabilities. generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the companys fixed income portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the companys insurance
reserves. although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial degree by which the market value of the fixed income portfolio exceeds the present value of the net insurance liabilities provides assurance of the
companys ability to fund the payment of claims through the sale of securities or a restructuring of the portfolio, if necessary, without jeopardizing its asset-liability management objectives. the company does not believe that the impact of
selling securities before anticipated or the use of credit facilities to pay for policyholder liabilities, if necessary, would have a material impact on future liquidity or results of operations.   at december 31, 2004, total cash and short-term invested assets of $159
million were held at the holding company level. these liquid assets were primarily funded by dividends received from the companys operating subsidiaries. these liquid assets, combined with other sources of funds available, primarily additional
dividends from the companys operating subsidiaries, are considered sufficient to meet the liquidity requirements of the company. these liquidity requirements include primarily, shareholder dividends and debt service.   net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $546 million, $1.10
billion and $800 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the 2004 outflows were primarily attributable to dividends paid to shareholders of $642 million. net maturities and retirements of debt, including the repurchase of ciris
outstanding notes, totaled $75 million in 2004. in addition, the company repurchased the minority interest in ciri during the second quarter for a total cost of $76 million.   cash flows used in financing activities in 2003 were primarily attributable to the redemption of $900 million aggregate
principal amount of junior subordinated debt securities held by subsidiary trusts, the repayment of $700 million of notes payable to a former affiliate and the repayment of $550 million of short-term debt. funds used in these repayments were
primarily provided by the companys issuance of $1.40 billion of senior notes in march 2003 and by cash flows provided by operating activities. these refinancing activities were initiated with the objective of lowering the average interest rate
on the companys total outstanding debt. also reflected in 2003 was the issuance of $550 million of short-term floating rate notes which were used to repay the $550 million promissory note due in january 2004. net cash flows used in financing
activities in 2003 also included dividends paid to shareholders of $282 million. the 2002 cash flows used in financing activities reflects the repayment of $6.35 billion of notes payable to citigroup. these payments were partially offset by the
receipt of $4.09 billion from the first quarter 2002 initial public offering and the issuance of $917 million of convertible notes payable.   the company paid $636 million of common dividends in 2004, comprised of regular quarterly dividends totaling $522 million and $114 million that had been
declared by spc prior to the merger. that amount consisted of spcs regular quarterly dividend at a rate of $0.29 per share ($66 million), and a special $0.21 per share ($48 million) dividend related to the merger. the special dividend declared
by spc prior to the closing of the merger was designed to result in the holders of spcs common stock prior to the merger receiving aggregate dividends with record dates in 2004 of $1.16 per share, which was spcs indicated annual dividend
rate prior to the merger. on january 26, 2005, the companys board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, payable march 31, 2005 to shareholders of record on march 10, 2005.   in 2004 and 2003, the company acquired 0.4 million and 0.8 million shares (as
adjusted for the merger), respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options. in 2003, tpc repurchased
approximately 1.1 million shares (as adjusted for the merger) of common stock at a total cost of $40 million, representing the acquisition of shares under a repurchase program that had been approved by tpcs board of directors. tpcs
repurchase program was terminated upon completion of the merger.

the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the companys common stock will be at
the discretion of the companys board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the companys financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of the companys operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory
constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems relevant. dividends would be paid by the company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the
company.   upon completion of the merger on april 1, 2004, the
company acquired all obligations related to spcs outstanding debt, which had a carrying value of $3.68 billion at the time of the merger. in accordance with purchase accounting, the carrying value of the spc debt acquired was adjusted to
market value as of april 1, 2004 using the effective interest rate method, which resulted in a $301 million adjustment to increase the amount of the companys consolidated debt outstanding. that fair value adjustment is being amortized over the
remaining life of the respective debt instruments acquired. that amortization, which totaled $56 million in 2004, reduced reported interest expense.   debt and convertible notes payable outstanding were as follows:

the company has the option to defer interest payments on its convertible junior subordinated notes for a
period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarterly interest periods. if the company elects to defer interest payments on the notes, it will not be permitted, with limited exceptions, to pay dividends on its common stock during a deferral period.
in february 2002, tpc paid a dividend of $1.00 billion to
citigroup in the form of a non-interest bearing note payable on december 31, 2002. on december 31, 2002, this note was repaid in its entirety. also in february 2002, tpc paid an additional dividend of $3.70 billion to citigroup in the form of a note
payable in two installments. this note was substantially prepaid following the offerings. the balance of $150 million was due on may 9, 2004. this note was prepaid on may 8, 2002. in march 2002, tpc paid a dividend of $395 million to citigroup in
the form of a note. this note was prepaid following the offerings.   in march 2002, tpc issued $893 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% convertible junior subordinated notes which will mature on april 15, 2032, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. interest is payable quarterly in
arrears. see note 10 of notes to the companys consolidated financial statements for a further discussion.   in august 2002, ciri issued $50 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% convertible notes which were to mature on december 31, 2032 unless earlier
redeemed or repurchased. the company repurchased these notes in 2004. see note 10 of notes to the companys consolidated financial statements for further discussion.   in december 2002, tpc entered into a loan agreement with an unaffiliated lender and borrowed $550 million under a promissory
note due in january 2004. the promissory note carried a variable interest rate of libor plus 25 basis points per annum. on february 5, 2003, tpc issued $550 million of floating rate notes due in february 2004. the proceeds from these notes were used
to repay the $550 million due on the promissory note. the floating rate notes also carried a variable interest rate of libor plus 25 basis points per annum. on march 14, 2003 and june 17, 2003, the company repurchased $75 million and $24 million,
respectively, of the floating rate notes at par plus accrued interest. the remaining $451 million were repaid on september 5, 2003.   on march 11, 2003, tpc issued $1.40 billion of senior notes comprising $400 million of 3.75% senior notes due march 15, 2008, $500 million of 5.00% senior
notes due march 15, 2013 and $500 million of 6.375% senior notes due march 15, 2033. the notes pay interest semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning september 15, 2003, are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with
all of tpcs other senior unsecured indebtedness. tpc may redeem some or all of the notes prior to maturity by paying a make-whole premium based on u.s. treasury rates. the net proceeds from the sale of these notes were contributed
to its primary subsidiary, tighi, so that tighi could prepay and refinance $500 million of 3.60% indebtedness to citigroup and to redeem $900 million aggregate principal amount of tighis 8.00% to 8.08% junior subordinated debt securities held
by subsidiary trusts. these trusts, in turn, used these funds to redeem $900 million of preferred capital securities on april 9, 2003.   these senior notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers as defined under rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 (the securities act) and
outside the united states in reliance on regulation s under the securities act. accordingly, the notes (the restricted notes) were not registered under the securities act or any state securities laws and could not be transferred or resold except
pursuant to certain exemptions. as part of this offering, tpc agreed to file a registration statement under the securities act to permit the exchange of the notes for registered notes (the exchange notes) having terms identical to those of the
senior notes described above (exchange offer). on april 14, 2003, tpc initiated the exchange offer pursuant to a form s-4 that was filed with the securities and exchange commission. accordingly, each series of exchange notes has been registered
under the securities act, and the transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the restricted notes do not apply to the exchange notes.

in july 2002, concurrent with the issuance of 17.8 million of spc common shares in a public offering, spc
issued 8.9 million equity units, each having a stated amount of $50, for gross consideration of $443 million. each equity unit initially consists of a forward purchase contract for the companys common stock (maturing in august 2005), and an
unsecured $50 senior note of the company (maturing in 2007). total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of 9.00%, consisting of interest on the note at a rate of 5.25% and fee payments under the forward contract of 3.75%. the
forward contract requires the investor to purchase, for $50, a variable number of shares of the companys common stock on the settlement date of august 16, 2005. the number of shares to be purchased will be determined based on a formula that
considers the average closing price of the companys stock on each of 20 consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the settlement date, in relation to the $24.20 per share price of common stock at the time
of the offering. had the settlement date been december 31, 2004, the company would have issued approximately 15 million common shares based on the average closing price of the companys common stock immediately prior to that date. holders of
the equity units have the opportunity to participate in a required remarketing of the senior note component. the initial remarketing date is may 11, 2005. the interest rate on the senior notes will be reset on the date of the remarketing and they
will bear interest from the date of the settlement of the successful remarketing at the reset rate.   the company currently intends to refinance certain maturing debt in 2005, including the $238 million of 7.875% senior notes due april 15, 2005, the $79
million of 7.125% senior notes due june 1, 2005, and a portion of the medium term notes with maturities in 2005.   line of credit agreements. effective april 17, 2003, tpc entered into the following line of credit agreements with citibank, a subsidiary of
citigroup, tpcs former parent: (i) a $250 million 45-month revolving line of credit (the 45-month line of credit), and (ii) a $250 million 364-day revolving line of credit (the tpc 364-day line of credit and, together with the 45-month line of
credit, the tpc lines of credit). tpc may, with citibanks consent, extend the commitment of the 364-day line of credit for additional 364-day periods under the same terms and conditions. tpc has the option, provided there is no default or
event of default, to convert outstanding advances under the 364-day line of credit at the commitment termination date to a term loan maturing no later than one year from the commitment termination date.   prior to the merger, spc was party to the following line of credit agreements
with a syndicate of banks: (i) a $330 million 364-day revolving line of credit (the spc 364-day line of credit), and (ii) a $270 million 5-year revolving line of credit (the 5-year line of credit and, together with the spc 364-day line of credit,
the spc lines of credit). spc may, with bank syndicate consent, extend the commitment of the spc 364-day line of credit for additional 364-day periods under the same terms and conditions.   as a result of the expiration of the spc 364-day line of credit and the tpc 364-day line of credit, the company entered into
a new $480 million 364-day revolving line of credit agreement (the sta 364-day line of credit) with a syndicate of banks. as of december 31, 2004, the company has access to the following bank credit lines: (i) the $250 million 45-month line of
credit, (ii) the $270 million 5-year line of credit, and (iii) the $480 million sta 364-day line of credit (collectively, the company line of credit).   borrowings under the company line of credit may be made, at the companys option, at a variable interest rate equal to either the lenders base
rate plus an applicable margin or at libor plus an applicable margin. the company line of credit includes a commitment fee and, for any date on which advances exceed 50% of the total commitment for each line of credit, a utilization fee. the
applicable margin and the rates on which the commitment fee and utilization fee are based vary based upon the companys long-term senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced debt ratings.

pursuant to covenants in the 5-year line of credit and sta 364-day line of credit, supporting the
companys commercial paper program, the company must maintain an excess of consolidated net worth over goodwill and other intangible assets of not less than $10 billion at all times. the company must also maintain a ratio of total consolidated
debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than 0.40 to 1.00. pursuant to the covenants in the 45-month line of credit, tpc and its subsidiaries must maintain, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter,
combined statutory capital and surplus in excess of $5.50 billion and a leverage ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated capital of less than 0.45 to 1.00. there were no ratings based triggers for the company line of credit. at
december 31, 2004, the company was in compliance with these covenants and all other covenants related to its respective debt instruments outstanding.   an event of default will occur if there is a change in control (as defined in the 45-month line of credit and 5-year line of credit agreements). the
merger of tpc and spc did constitute a change in control for both tpc and spc; however, both entities obtained a waiver from their respective banks of that event of default. there were no amounts outstanding under the company line of credit at
december 31, 2004.   contractual obligations   the following table excludes short-term obligations. the table also excludes

and claim related payments. the amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates, generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques, at a given accounting date. these estimates include expectations of what the
ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the companys assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of
liability and other factors. variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes. many of these
items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. the future cash

the amounts in claims and claim adjustment expenses in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and
unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverables. therefore, estimated future payments include cash inflows related to reinsurance arrangements that qualify for reinsurance accounting. a reinsurance
agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk, in order to qualify for reinsurance accounting. timing risk is transferred if the agreement requires timely reimbursement from the
reinsurer to the insurer. since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are highly correlated to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, the analysis above presents the estimated
cash outlay for reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expense, net of reinsurance. reinsurance agreements that do not transfer both amount and

workers compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then
seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. claims from large deductible policies represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery
of the deductible. the liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as contractholder payable and contractholder receivable, respectively. most deductibles
for such policies are paid directly from the policyholders escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder. the payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within claims and claim adjustment expenses
in the above table. because the timing of the collection of the deductible (contractholder receivable) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payable), these cash flows offset each other in the table.

with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurers surplus as of the preceding december 31,
or the insurers net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding december 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. (in the case of minnesota, net income excludes realized investment gains for
purposes of the calculation of the 10% threshold). this declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.   the insurance holding company laws of other states in which the
companys subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. a maximum of $2.61 billion is available by the end of 2005 for such dividends without
prior approval of the connecticut insurance department for connecticut-domiciled subsidiaries and the minnesota department of commerce for minnesota-domiciled subsidiaries. the company received $2.09 billion of dividends from its insurance
subsidiaries in 2004.   risk-based capital   the naic adopted rbc requirements for property casualty companies to be used
as minimum capital requirements by the naic and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory action. the formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital higher
than rbc requirements. therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. at december 31, 2004, all of the companys insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring
any company or regulatory action.   off-balance sheet arrangements
the company has entered into certain contingent
obligations for guarantees related to agency loans and letters of credit, issuance of debt securities, third party loans related to venture capital investments and various indemnifications related to the sale of business entities to third parties.
see note 17 to the companys consolidated financial statements. the company does not expect these arrangements to have a material effect on the companys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results
of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.   critical accounting estimates   the company
considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, and investment impairments.   claim and claim adjustment expense reserves
claim and claim adjustment expense reserves (loss reserves) represent managements estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment
expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates, generally utilizing actuarial
expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. these loss reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the companys
assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. in establishing reserves,
the company also takes into account estimated recoveries, reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. the reserves are reviewed regularly by a qualified actuary employed by the company.   the process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these
variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims
table of contents
index to financial statements
handling procedures, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative changes, among others. the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for loss and
loss adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the
determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). informed judgment is applied throughout the process. the company continually
refines its loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. the company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the
time loss reserves are established. due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates including but not limited to the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability will be different from that anticipated
at the reporting date. therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than currently reservedfavorable or unfavorable.   because establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established
reserves may change. the company reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.   a portion of the companys loss reserves are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation which aggregated $4.57 billion at december
31, 2004. while the ongoing study of asbestos claims and associated liabilities and of environmental claims considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in
major litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the companys management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current
reserves by an amount that could be material to the companys future operating results and financial condition. see the preceding discussion of asbestos claims and litigation and environmental claims and litigation.   as described earlier, the company acquired spcs runoff health care
reserves in the merger, which are included in the general liability product line in the table below. spc decided to exit this market at the end of 2001 and ceased underwriting new business as quickly as regulatory considerations allowed. spc had
experienced significant adverse loss development on its health care loss reserves both prior to and since its decision to exit this market. the company continues to utilize specific tools and metrics to explicitly monitor and validate its key
assumptions supporting its conclusions with regard to these reserves. these tools and metrics were established to more explicitly monitor and validate key assumptions supporting the companys reserve conclusions since management believed that
its traditional statistics and reserving methods needed to be supplemented in order to provide a more meaningful analysis. the tools developed track three primary indicators which influence those conclusions and include: newly reported claims;
reserve development on known claims; and the redundancy ratio, which compares the cost of resolving claims to the reserve established for that individual claim. these three indicators are related such that if one deteriorates, additional
improvement on another is necessary for the company to conclude that further reserve strengthening is not necessary. the results of these indicators in 2004 support the companys current view that it has recorded a reasonable provision for its
medical malpractice exposures as of december 31, 2004. however, the company will take reserve actions in the future if these indicators no longer support this view.

claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at december 31, 2004 increased by $24.51 billion over year-end 2003, primarily as a result of the merger with spc and reserve charges recorded subsequent to the merger. of the increase in 2004, $19.50
billion resulted from the addition of the acquired reserves, and $2.39 billion, net of reinsurance, was due to net unfavorable prior year reserve development primarily comprised of $928 million to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result
of the completion of the companys annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter, $290 million to strengthen environmental reserves, $800 million of reserve adjustments related to the merger for surety and construction loss reserves,
$252 million related to a specific construction contractor, $113 million related to the commutation of agreements with a major reinsurer and other net reserving actions. for discussion of the components of net unfavorable prior year reserve
development, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.   asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the general liability, commercial multi-peril lines and international and other lines in the summary table. asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately, see asbestos
claims and litigation, environmental claims and litigation and uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves.   general discussion   claim and claim adjustment expense reserves (loss reserves) represent managements estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of
losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. the process for estimating these liabilities begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. data on individual
reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities
by product line. such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. the process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated
information.   multiple estimation methods are available for the
analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of
assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. the relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. therefore, the actual choice of
estimation method(s) can change with each evaluation. the estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated.
table of contents
index to financial statements
in most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of
the claim liabilities being evaluated. this will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability. the company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting
segments are reasonable, given subsequent information. reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. these reviews may substantiate the validity of managements
recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate.   the exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable
to unreasonable. as a result, the company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. in addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines
make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process.   property casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims made or on an occurrence basis. policies written on a claims made basis require that claims be reported during the policy period. policies that are
written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later.   most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. these policies are subject to substantial loss
development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. the use of the occurrence form accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, and it is also used to provide
coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. occurrence based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation and judicial interpretations
and societal litigation dynamics, among others.   a key
assumption in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. to the extent a material change affecting the
ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company and, if available and when appropriate, external data. such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the
particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated.   informed management judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. this includes the application, on a consistent basis over time, of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. in addition to
actuaries, individuals involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel as well as other company management. therefore, it is quite possible and, generally, likely that management must consider varying individual
viewpoints as part of its estimation of loss reserves. it is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger, consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult.   the variables discussed above in this general discussion have different
impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line.   product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail,
based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. the longer the time before
final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty.   a major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. the reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of
the claim to the insurer, makes estimating ibnr inherently more
table of contents
index to financial statements
uncertain. in addition, the greater the reporting lag the greater the proportion of ibnr claims to the total claim liability for the product line. writing
new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years worth of ibnr claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products.
the most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims. a more recent but less extreme example is automobile leasing residual value coverage.   for some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. these lines are generally referred to
as being low frequency/high severity, while lines without this large claim sensitivity are referred to as high frequency/low severity. estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to a
few key assumptions. as a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. in contrast, high frequency/low severity lines tend to have much greater spread of estimation risk, such that the impact of individual claims are
relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable.   claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process and the ability
to gain an understanding of the data. product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation uncertainty.   actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of
reserves. the human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. different experts will choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds,
professional experiences and areas of focus. hence, the estimate selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other.   lastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process.
during the past year, the merger of tpc and spc resulted in the exposure of each others actuaries and claim departments to different products, data histories, analysis methodologies, claim settlement experts, and more robust data when viewed
on a combined basis. this has impacted the range of estimates produced by the companys actuaries, as they have reacted to new data, approaches, and sources of expertise to draw upon. it has also resulted in additional levels of uncertainty, as
past trends (that were a function of past products, past claim handling procedures, past claim departments, and past legal and other experts) may not repeat themselves, as those items affecting the trends change or evolve due to the merger. this has
also increased the potential for material variation in estimates, as experts can have differing views as to the impact of these frequently evolutionary changes. events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a
period of time, until stable trends reestablish themselves within the new organization.   risk factors   the major causes of
material uncertainty (risk factors) generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line. in some cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and
in others, they are implicit. for example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. actual
results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently.   some risk factors will affect more than one product line. examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in
settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants, and degree of claimant fraud. the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product
line. individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components.
table of contents
index to financial statements
the effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most
cases. for example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other
factors.   the evaluation of data is also subject to distortion
from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. for example, the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe
claims in another region.   while some changes in the claim
environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more evolutionary. evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the
uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in step-wise fashion. the final impact is not known until all steps have occurred.   sudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact.
evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable.   managements estimates   at least once per quarter, company management meets with its actuaries to review the latest claim and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. based on
these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. in doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on
estimated ultimate claim liability. for example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. the resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to
determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability.   such an assessment requires considerable judgment. it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime
after the event. even if a change is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. the overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to
perform. this is due to the need to evaluate the underlying cause of the trends observed, and may include the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. it may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying
processes. as a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the companys estimated claim liabilities. the final estimate selected by management in a reporting
period is a function of these detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable information.   discussion of product lines   the following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. there are many additional risk factors that may impact
ultimate claim costs. each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. for example, in workers compensation, the use of expensive
medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and
construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation.   general liability
general liability is generally considered a long tail

index to financial statements
the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self-insured retentions. there are numerous components underlying the
general liability product line. some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within 5 to 7 years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g.,
a reporting lag of a decade for construction defect claims).   while the majority of general liability coverages are written on an occurrence basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability) are
typically insured on a claims-made basis.   general
liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage. bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for
damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholders legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. in some cases the damages can include future wage loss
(which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimants private property arising from the policyholders legal
obligation for non-intentional acts. in most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter. in addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately, such as asbestos, environmental, other mass
torts, construction defect, medical malpractice and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis. these unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on traditional
actuarial methods.   defense costs are also a part of the
insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. for some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the
amount of policy limit available to pay the claim. such defense within the limits policies are most common for claims made products. when defense costs are outside of the limits, amounts paid do not erode the policy limits.
this line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate
uncertainty in the united states (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e. the length of time between the event triggering coverage and
the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, whether the event triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars
involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. claims with
longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. this is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants
(and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag, i.e., the lag between
writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure.   the amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. the components in this product
line with the longest latency, longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved, and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity issues, but to a
materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect, medical malpractice, and other mass tort actions, such as those related to silicone implants. many components of general liability are not subject to material
latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. in general, policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one
policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably

related to large properties. the claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except
possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims.   property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required property

commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property
and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. for property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally
for the liability coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims.   the reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. the reserving risk for this line differs from
that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. commercial multi-peril is generally sold to smaller sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and property include
larger customers.   see the discussions under the property and
general liability product lines with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril.   commercial automobile   the commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims
and property damage (liability) claims. the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. in general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is
viewed as high frequency, low to moderate severity. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.   commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components; bodily injury liability, property damage liability, collision claims and
comprehensive claims. these last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented.   examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general

underwriting standards   workers compensation   workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as
it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made
over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. in addition, some payments can run as long as the injured workers life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going medical care. despite the possibility
of long payment tail, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency, moderate severity. the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high
severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a workers injury. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk.   workers compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three
components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses.   examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required workers compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:   indemnity risk factors  time required to recover from the injury  degree of available transitional

pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity policies.   surety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and
commercial surety contracts can result in a somewhat longer settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured. (large construction projects can take many years to complete.) the
frequency of losses in surety correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability to perform financially. the volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured, the
type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of an
insureds assets. certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. these can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial
surety exposures. other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured.

affect the required fidelity and surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:   fidelity risk factors  type of

insurer. claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual. the claim
is settled when the two parties agree on the amount due in accordance with the policy contract language and the appropriate payment is made (or alternatively, the property replacement/repair is performed by the insurer). the resulting settlement
process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist.   the liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags. in addition, reserves related to umbrella coverages have
greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future.   overall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity.   homeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments.

international and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and
jurisdictions/countries. the common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the u.s. statutory reporting framework.
due to changes in the business mix for this line over time,
the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., the republic of ireland and the united kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that
are extremely long tail (e.g., u.s. excess liabilities reinsured through the london market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the
jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct), and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured and insurer located in different countries). in particular, liabilities arising from the
underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes.
international and other reserves are generally analyzed by
program/pool, country and general coverage category (e.g., u.s. liabilityexcess of loss reinsurance, or general liability  municipalities  by country.) the business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a
given coverage/jurisdiction. where the underlying insured hazard is outside the united states, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the general liability and automobile discussion above, but under a different legal
system. where the underlying hazard is within the u.s., the coverage involved is typically that of general liability, but on an excess or excess-of-loss reinsurance basis. excess exposure requires the insured to prove not only claims
under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policys attachment point.   examples of common risk factors that can change and, thus, affect the required international and other reserves (beyond those included in the general
discussion section) include:   international

amounts recoverable
from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured business. the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize
its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the company may become involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and
arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the companys rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections
and disputes.   the company reports its reinsurance recoverables
net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. the allowance is based upon the companys ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable
coverage defenses, and other relevant factors. accordingly, the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. changes in
these estimates could result in additional income statement charges. the increase in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance in 2004 was $364 million, $256 million of which was merger-related and $108 million of which resulted from the
companys ongoing review process described above.   the

as of december 31,
2004, the company had reinsurance recoverables from syndicates at lloyds of $738 million. in 1996, lloyds restructured its operations with respect to claims for years prior to 1993 and reinsured these into equitas limited, which is
currently unrated. approximately $90 million of the companys lloyds reinsurance recoverable at december 31, 2004 relates to equitas liabilities. the remaining recoverables of $648 million are from the continuing market of lloyds,
which is rated a (third highest of 16 ratings) by a.m. best. during the first quarter of 2004, tpc entered into an agreement to settle all current and future reinsurance claims against certain underwriters at lloyds reinsured by equitas. under
terms of this settlement, the company received $245 million, resolving approximately $255 million of tpcs net claim balances from equitas. virtually all of the $90 million reinsurance recoverables relating to equitas remaining at december 31,
2004 relate to spc.

investment impairments
fixed maturities and equity securities   an investment in a fixed maturity or equity security which is available for sale or reported at fair value is impaired if its fair value falls below its
book value and the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary.   fixed maturities for which fair value is less than 80% of amortized cost for more than one quarter are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment. a fixed maturity is impaired if it is probable that the company will not be able to
collect all amounts due under the securitys contractual terms.   factors the company considers in determining whether a decline is other-than-temporary for debt securities include the following:
the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost. it is likely that the decline will become other-than-temporary if the market value has been
below cost for six to nine months or more;
the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. the issuer may be experiencing depressed and declining earnings relative to competitors, erosion of market share,
deteriorating financial position, lowered dividend payments, declines in securities ratings, bankruptcy, and financial statement reports that indicate an uncertain future. also, the issuer may experience specific events that may influence its
operations or earnings potential, such as changes in technology, discontinuation of a business segment, catastrophic losses or exhaustion of natural resources; and
the companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery.   equity investments are impaired when it becomes probable that the company
will not recover its cost over the expected holding period. public equity investments (i.e., common stocks) trading at a price that is less than 80% of cost for more than one quarter are reviewed for impairment. investments accounted for using the
equity method of accounting are evaluated for impairment any time the investment has sustained losses and/or negative operating cash flow for a period of nine months or more. events triggering the other-than-temporary impairment analysis of public
and non-public equities may include the following, in addition to the considerations noted above for debt securities:   factors affecting performance:
the investee loses a principal customer or supplier for which there is no short-term prospect for replacement or experiences other substantial changes in market conditions;
the company is performing substantially and consistently behind plan;
the investee has announced, or the company has become aware of, adverse changes or events such as changes or planned changes in senior management, restructurings, or a sale of
assets; and
the regulatory, economic, or technological environment has changed in a way that is expected to adversely affect the investees profitability.   factors affecting on-going financial condition:
factors that raise doubts about the investees ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working-capital deficiencies, investment
advisors recommendations, or non-compliance with regulatory capital requirements or debt covenants;
a secondary equity offering at a price substantially lower than the holders cost;
a breach of a covenant or the failure to service debt; and
fraud within the company.
table of contents
index to financial statements
for fixed maturity and equity investments, factors that may indicate that a decline in value is not
other-than-temporary include the following:
the securities owned continue to generate reasonable earnings and dividends, despite a general stock market decline;
bond interest or preferred stock dividend rate (on cost) is lower than rates for similar securities issued currently but quality of investment is not adversely affected;
the investment is performing as expected and is current on all expected payments;
specific, recognizable, short-term factors have affected the market value; and
financial condition, market share, backlog and other key statistics indicate growth.   real estate investments   the carrying values of real estate properties are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. the review for impairment includes an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the real estate property. an impairment loss is recognized if the expected future
undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the real estate property.   venture capital investments   other investments
include venture capital investments, which are generally non-publicly traded instruments, consisting of early-stage companies and, historically, having a holding period of four to seven years. these investments have primarily been made in the health
care, software and computer services, and networking and information technologies infrastructures industries. the company typically is involved with venture capital companies early in their formation, as they are developing and determining the
viability of, and market demand for, their product. generally the company does not expect these venture capital companies to record revenues in the early stages of their development, which can often take three to four years, and does not generally
expect them to become profitable for an even longer period of time. with respect to the companys valuation of such non-publicly traded venture capital investments, on a quarterly basis, portfolio managers as well as an internal valuation
committee review and consider a variety of factors in determining the potential for loss impairment. factors considered include the following:
the issuers most recent financing event;
an analysis of whether fundamental deterioration has occurred;
whether or not the issuers progress has been substantially less than expected;
whether or not the valuations have declined significantly in the entitys market sector;
whether or not the internal valuation committee believes it is probable that the issuer will need financing within six months at a lower price than our carrying value; and
whether or not we have the ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery, enabling us to receive value equal to or greater than our
cost.   the quarterly valuation procedures
described above are in addition to the portfolio managers ongoing responsibility to frequently monitor developments affecting those invested assets, paying particular attention to events that might give rise to impairment write-downs.
the company manages the portfolio to maximize long-term
return, evaluating current market conditions and the future outlook for the entities in which it has invested. because this portfolio primarily consists of

privately-held, early-stage venture investments, events giving rise to impairment can occur in a brief period of time (e.g., the entity has been unsuccessful
in securing additional financing, other investors decide to withdraw their support, complications arise in the product development process, etc.), and decisions are made at that point in time, based on the specific facts and circumstances, with
respect to a recognition of other-than-temporary impairment or sale of the investment.   non-publicly traded investments   the companys investment portfolio includes non-publicly traded investments, such as venture capital investments, private equity limited partnerships, joint ventures, other limited partnerships, and certain fixed income securities.
venture capital investments owned directly are consolidated in the companys financial statements. the company uses the equity method of accounting for joint ventures, limited partnerships and certain private equity securities. certain other
private equity investments, including venture capital investments, are not subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards (fas) no. 115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, but are
reported at estimated fair value in accordance with fas 60, accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises. the fair value of the venture capital investments is based on an estimate determined by an internal valuation committee for
securities for which there is no public market. the internal valuation committee reviews such factors as recent filings, operating results, balance sheet stability, growth, and other business and market sector fundamental statistics in estimating
fair values of specific investments.   the following is a

other matters   on july 23, 2004, the company announced that it was seeking guidance from
the staff of the division of corporation finance of the securities exchange commission with respect to the appropriate purchase accounting treatment for certain second quarter 2004 adjustments totaling $1.63 billion ($1.07 billion after-tax). the
company recorded these adjustments as charges in its income statement in the second quarter of 2004. through an informal comment process, the staff of the division of corporation finance has subsequently asked for further information relating to
these adjustments, and the dialogue is ongoing. specifically, the staff has asked for information concerning the companys adjustments to certain of spcs insurance reserves and reserves for reinsurance recoverables and premiums due from
policyholders, and how those adjustments may relate to spcs reserves for periods prior to the merger. after reviewing the staffs questions and comments and discussions with the companys independent auditors, the company continues
to believe that its accounting treatment for these adjustments is appropriate. if, however, the staff disagrees, some or all of the adjustments being discussed may not be recorded as charges in the companys income statement, thereby increasing
net income for the second quarter and full year 2004 and increasing shareholders equity at december 31, 2004, in each case by the approximate after-tax amount of the change. the effect on tangible shareholders equity (adjusted for the
effects of deferred taxes associated with goodwill and intangible assets) at december 31, 2004 would not be material. increases to goodwill and deferred tax liabilities would be reflected on the companys balance sheet as of april 1, 2004,
either due to purchase accounting or adjustment of spcs reserves prior to the merger.

reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on a statutory basis were $41.73 billion, $24.03 billion
and $23.28 billion at december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the $17.70 billion increase in 2004 primarily resulted from the merger with spc and reserve charges recorded subsequent to the merger. those reserve charges included $928 million
to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result of the completion of the companys annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter, $290 million to strengthen environmental reserves, reserve adjustments related to the merger of
$500 million for construction and $300 million for surety, $252 million related to a specific construction contractor, $113 million related to the commutation of agreements with a major reinsurer, and other net reserving actions.   the $749 million increase in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses
on a statutory basis from december 31, 2002 to december 31, 2003 was primarily due to business growth, and reserve strengthening at gulf which increased reserves by $521 million and american equity which increased reserves by $115 million, partially
offset by asbestos and environmental net loss payments of $607 million.   prior to the ipo, tpc participated in citigroups capital accumulation plan (cap) that provided for the issuance of shares of citigroup common stock in the form of restricted stock awards to eligible officers and other key employees.
on august 20, 2002, in connection with the citigroup distribution, the unvested outstanding awards of restricted stock and deferred shares held by tpc employees on that date under citigroup cap awards were cancelled and replaced by awards comprised
primarily of 3 million newly issued shares of class a common stock at a total market value of $53 million based on the closing price of the class a common stock on august 20, 2002. these replacement awards were granted on substantially the same
terms, including vesting, as the former citigroup awards. the value of these newly issued shares along with class a and class b common stock received in the citigroup distribution on the citigroup restricted shares, were equal to the value of the
cancelled citigroup restricted share awards. in addition the board of directors plan allows deferred receipt of shares of class a common stock (deferred stock) to a future distribution date or upon termination of their service.   prior to the citigroup distribution on august 20, 2002, unearned compensation
expense associated with the citigroup restricted common stock grants is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. following the citigroup distribution and the issuance of replacement stock awards in tpcs class a and class b
shares on august 20, 2002, the unamortized unearned compensation expense associated with these awards is included as unearned compensation in the consolidated balance sheet. unearned compensation expense is recognized as a charge to income ratably
over the vesting period. the after-tax compensation cost charged to earnings for these restricted stock and deferred stock awards was $26 million, $17 million and $17 million for the years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. see

item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   market risk   market
risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and other relevant market rate or price changes. market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and
liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. the following is a discussion of the companys primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december 31, 2004. the companys
market risk sensitive instruments, including derivatives, are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading.
table of contents
index to financial statements
the carrying value of the companys investment portfolio as of december 31, 2004 and 2003 was $64.71
billion and $38.65 billion, respectively, of which 84% and 85% was invested in fixed maturity securities, respectively. at december 31, 2004, approximately 7% of the companys invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies. the
companys exposure to foreign exchange risk was not significant at december 31, 2003. the companys exposure to equity price risk is not significant. the company has no direct commodity risk.   the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk
associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions.   the primary market risk for all of the companys debt is interest rate
risk at the time of refinancing. the company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach. for additional information regarding the companys debt see notes 10 and 11 to the
companys consolidated financial statements as well as the liquidity and capital resources section of managements discussion and analysis.   as a result of the merger, changes in the companys exposure to foreign exchange risk have occurred since december 31, 2003. this market risk
exposure is concentrated in the companys invested assets, and insurance reserves, denominated in foreign currencies. cash flows from the companys foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments
denominated in foreign currencies. the company purchases these investments primarily to fund insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency, effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure. invested assets
denominated in the british pound sterling comprised approximately 3.5% of the total invested assets at december 31, 2004. no other individual foreign currency accounted for more than 1.5% of the companys invested assets at december 31, 2004.
there were no other significant changes in the companys
primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended december 31, 2004 compared to the year ended december 31, 2003. the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk
exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.   sensitivity analysis   sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings, fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments
resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time. in the companys sensitivity analysis model, a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to
reflect reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. near-term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in
market rates assumed in this disclosure, especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value.   interest rate risk   in this sensitivity analysis model, the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss. the sensitivity analysis
model includes the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading: fixed maturities, non-redeemable preferred stocks, mortgage loans, short-term securities, debt and derivative financial instruments. the primary market
risk to the companys market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk. the sensitivity analysis model uses a 100 basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the
model.
table of contents
index to financial statements
for invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk, estimates of portfolio duration and
convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result from a parallel increase in interest rates. durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put and interest rate reset features. durations on tax-exempt
securities are adjusted for the fact that the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the u.s. treasury curve. fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis, including accrued
interest, using holdings as of december 31, 2004 and 2003.   for
debt, the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical december 31, 2004 and 2003 ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a 100 basis point change, comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices, and
multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding.   the sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately $2.1 billion and $1.2 billion based on a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of december 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively.   the loss estimates do not take into
account the impact of possible interventions that the company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from emerging interest rate trends. in addition, the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest
rate increase on the fair value of the companys financial instruments. as a result, the loss value excludes a significant portion of the companys consolidated balance sheet, which if included in the sensitivity analysis model, would
mitigate the impact of the loss in fair value associated with a 100 basis point increase in interest rates.   foreign currency exchange rate risk   the company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments. a hypothetical 10% reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate
the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings. the potential loss is reduced by foreign currency forward transactions that are used to hedge a portion of the companys exposure to foreign currencies. the companys
analysis indicates that a hypothetical 10% reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $438 million at december 31, 2004. the companys exposure to foreign
exchange risk was not significant at december 31, 2003.

1.
summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the st. paul travelers companies, inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the company). on
april 1, 2004, travelers property casualty corp. (tpc) merged with a subsidiary of the st. paul companies, inc. (spc), as a result of which tpc became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the st. paul travelers companies, inc. for accounting purposes, this
transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with tpc treated as the accounting acquirer. accordingly, this transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination, using tpcs historical financial information and applying
fair value estimates to the acquired assets, liabilities and commitments of spc as of april 1, 2004. (see note 2 for a description of the fair value adjustments recorded). beginning on april 1, 2004, the results of operations and financial condition
of spc were consolidated with tpcs results of operations and financial condition. accordingly, all financial information presented herein for the twelve months ended december 31, 2004 reflects the accounts of tpc for the three months ended
march 31, 2004 and the consolidated accounts of spc and tpc for the subsequent nine months ended december 31, 2004. the financial information presented herein for 2003 and 2002 reflects the accounts of tpc. certain reclassifications have been made
to prior years financial statements to conform to the current years presentation. significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.   in connection with the merger, each issued and outstanding share of tpc class a and class b common stock (including the
associated preferred stock purchase rights) was exchanged for 0.4334 of a share of the companys common stock. share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the exchange of tpcs common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, for the companys common stock without designated par value. common stock and additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet were also restated to give effect to the difference in par value of the exchanged
shares. cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares of the companys common stock. immediately following consummation of the merger, historical tpc shareholders held approximately 66% of the companys common stock. for further information
regarding the merger, see note 2.    tpc was reorganized
in connection with its initial public offering (ipo) on march 21, 2002. tpc issued common stock representing approximately 23% of tpcs common equity. after the ipo, citigroup inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, citigroup)
beneficially owned all of the 500 million shares of tpcs outstanding class b common stock, each share of which is entitled to seven votes, and 269 million shares of tpcs class a common stock, each share of which is entitled to one vote,
representing at the time 94% of the combined voting power of all classes of tpcs voting securities and 77% of the equity interest in tpc. (all class a and class b share amounts presented are unadjusted for the merger of tpc and spc). for
further information on the ipo and related corporate reorganization, see note 3.   the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ
from those estimates.    adoption of new accounting standards
effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share
in october 2004, the financial accounting standards board
(fasb) emerging issues task force (eitf) issued eitf 04-8, the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share, providing new

the st. paul travelers companies, inc. and subsidiaries   notes to consolidated financial statements(continued)
1.
summary of significant accounting policies, continued
guidance on the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt instruments. eitf 04-8 requires that contingently convertible debt instruments are included
in diluted earnings per share, under the if-converted method, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. under fas 128, earnings per share, contingently convertible debt instruments which contain market price triggers were
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share until the market trigger conditions were met.   the company has $893 million of 4.50% convertible junior subordinated notes outstanding which are subject to the new eitf 04-8 guidance. these convertible
junior subordinated notes mature on april 15, 2032 unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. the notes are convertible into approximately 17 million shares of the companys common stock at the option of the holder after march 27, 2003
and prior to april 15, 2032 if at any time certain contingency conditions are met. on or after april 18, 2007, the notes may be redeemed at the companys option.   eitf 04-8 is effective for fiscal years ended after december 15, 2004 and requires restatement of prior period earnings per
share for comparative periods. accordingly, the company has restated diluted earnings per share for prior periods to include the impact of the convertible junior subordinated notes where the impact of including these securities was dilutive. see
note 7 for the impact on earnings per share.   consolidation of variable
interest entities   in december 2003, the fasb issued
revised interpretation no. 46, consolidation of variable interest entities (fin 46r). fin 46r, along with its related interpretations, clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no. 51, consolidated financial
statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support. fin 46r separates entities into two groups: (1) those for which voting interests are used to determine consolidation and (2) those for which variable interests are used to determine consolidation. fin 46r clarifies
how to identify a variable interest entity (vie) and how to determine when a business enterprise should include the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements. a company
that absorbs a majority of a vies expected losses, receives a majority of a vies expected residual returns, or both, is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie into its financial statements. fin 46r also requires
disclosure of certain information where the reporting company is the primary beneficiary or holds a significant variable interest in a vie (but is not the primary beneficiary).   fin 46r is effective for public companies that have interests in vies that are considered special-purpose entities for
periods ending after december 15, 2003. application by public companies for all other types of entities is required for periods ending after march 15, 2004. the company adopted fin 46r effective december 31, 2003.   the company holds significant interests in hedge fund investments that are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments in the consolidated balance sheet. hedge funds are unregistered private investment partnerships, limited liability companies (llc), funds or pools that may
invest and trade in many different markets, strategies and instruments (including securities, non-securities and derivatives). three hedge funds were determined to be significant vies and have a total value for all investors combined of
approximately $175 million and $326 million as of december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. the companys share of these funds has a carrying value of approximately $54 million and $93 million at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. the
companys involvement with these funds began in the third quarter of 2002.

summary of significant accounting policies, continued
there are various purposes for the companys involvement in these funds, including but not
limited to the following:
to seek capital appreciation by investing and trading in securities including, without limitation, investments in common stock, bonds, notes, debentures, investment contracts,
partnership interests, options and warrants;
to buy and sell u.s. and non-u.s. assets with primary focus on a diversified pool of structured mortgage and asset-backed securities offering attractive and relative value; and
to sell securities short primarily to exploit arbitrage opportunities in a broad range of equity and fixed income markets.   the company has an unfunded commitment of $9 million associated with one of
these funds. the companys exposure to loss is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet.   the following entities, which were acquired in the merger, are consolidated under fin 46r:
municipal truststhe company owns interests in various municipal trusts that were formed for the purpose of allowing more flexibility to generate investment income in a manner
consistent with the companys investment objectives and tax position. as of december 31, 2004, there were 36 such trusts, which held a combined total of $450 million in municipal securities, of which $84 million were owned by outside investors.
the net carrying value of the trusts owned by the company at december 31, 2004 was $366 million.
venture capital entitiesin the companys venture capital investment portfolio, the company has investments in small-to-medium sized companies, in which the company has
variable interests through stock ownership and, in some cases, loans. these investments are held for the purpose of generating long-term investment returns, and the companies in which the company invests span a variety of business sectors. the
company consolidates three entities under the provisions of fin 46r. the combined carrying value of these entities at december 31, 2004 was $5 million. the company had an unfunded commitment of $1 million associated with one of these entities.
the following securities, which were acquired in
the merger, are not consolidated under fin 46r:
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trusts holding solely the subordinated debentures of the companythese securities were issued by five separate trusts that were
established for the sole purpose of issuing the securities to investors, and are fully guaranteed by the company. the debt that the company issued to these trusts is included in the debt section of liabilities on the companys
consolidated balance sheet. that debt had a carrying value of $1.04 billion at december 31, 2004.   in addition to the foregoing entities, the company also acquired in the merger significant interests in other vies which are not consolidated because the
company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary. these entities are as follows:
the company has a significant variable interest in one real estate entity. this investment has total assets of approximately $117 million as of december 31, 2004. the carrying value
of the companys share of this investment was approximately $38 million at december 31, 2004, which also represents its maximum exposure to loss. the purpose of the companys involvement in this entity is to generate investment returns.

summary of significant accounting policies, continued
the company also has a variable interest in camperdown uk limited, which spc sold in december 2003. the companys variable interest results from an agreement to indemnify the
purchaser in the event a specified reserve deficiency develops, a reserve-related foreign exchange impact occurs, or a foreign tax adjustment is imposed on a pre-sale reporting period. the maximum amount of this indemnification obligation is $200
million. the fair value of this obligation as of december 31, 2004 was $44 million.   accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003   on december 8, 2003, president bush signed the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 (2003
medicare act) into law. the 2003 medicare act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent
to medicare part d. on january 12, 2004, fasb issued staff position fas 106-1, accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 (fsp 106-1), which permits sponsors of
retiree health care benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits to make a one-time election to defer accounting for the effects of the 2003 medicare act. fasb staff position fas 106-2, accounting and disclosure requirements related to
the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 (fsp 106-2), was issued on may 19, 2004, supersedes fsp 106-1 and provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the 2003 medicare act for sponsors of retiree
health care benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits. fsp 106-2 also requires certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy.   the company has concluded that the prescription drug benefits available under the spc postretirement benefit plan are actuarially equivalent to medicare
part d and thus qualify for the federal subsidy under the 2003 medicare act. the company also expects that the federal subsidy will offset or reduce the companys share of the cost of the underlying postretirement prescription drug coverage on
which the subsidy is based. as a result, the estimated effect of the 2003 medicare act was reflected in the purchase accounting re-measurement of the spc postretirement benefit plan on april 1, 2004. the effect of this adjustment was a $29 million
reduction (with no tax effect) in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of april 1, 2004 and a reduction of $2 million in net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended december31, 2004.   accounting for stock-based compensation   effective january 1, 2003, the company adopted the fair value method of
accounting for its employee stock-based compensation plans as defined in fasb statement of financial accounting standards no. 123, accounting for stock-based compensation (fas 123), using the prospective recognition transition alternative of
fasb statement of financial accounting standards no. fas 148, accounting for stock based compensationtransition and disclosure (fas 148). fas 123 indicates that the fair value based method is the preferred method of accounting. the
company has elected to use the prospective recognition transition alternative of fas 148. under this alternative only the awards granted, modified, or settled after january 1, 2003 will be accounted for in accordance with the fair value method. the
adoption of fas 123 did not have a significant impact on the companys results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

business combinations, goodwill and other intangible assets   effective january 1, 2002, the company adopted fasb statements of financial
accounting standards no. 141, business combinations (fas 141), and no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets (fas 142). these standards changed the accounting for business combinations by, among other things,
prohibiting the prospective use of pooling-of-interests accounting and requiring companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite useful life created by business combinations accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting. instead, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life are subject to an annual review for impairment. other intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite useful life continue to be
amortized over their useful lives.   during the quarter ended
march 31, 2002, the company performed the transitional impairment tests using the fair value approach required by fas 142. based on these tests, the company impaired $220 million after tax of goodwill and $23 million after tax of indefinite-lived
intangible assets representing the value of insurance operating licenses, all attributable to the northland company and its subsidiaries (northland), as a cumulative effect adjustment as of january 1, 2002. the fair value of the northland reporting
unit was based on the use of a multiple of earnings model. the fair value of northlands indefinite-lived intangible assets was based on the present value of estimated net cash flows. northland is a component of the commercial operating
segment.   accounting policies not yet adopted   share-based payment   in december 2004, the fasb issued revised statement of financial standards no. 123, share-based payment (fas 123r),
an amendment to fas 123 and a replacement of apb opinion no. 25, accounting for stock issued to employees, and its related implementation guidance. fas 123r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award, and to recognize that cost over the requisite service period.   as of the required effective date, fas 123r requires entities that use the fair-value method of either recognition or disclosure under fas 123, to apply a
modified version of the prospective application. under modified prospective application, compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for all unvested awards, based on their grant-date fair value as calculated under fas
123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes. fas 123r is effective july 1, 2005.   the company adopted the fair value method of accounting under fas 123 on january 1, 2003. the fair value effect of stock options is derived by the
application of an option pricing model. the impact of fas 123r will be the additional expense relating to unvested awards granted prior to january 1, 2003 and which remain outstanding on the date of adoption of fas 123r. the company does not
expect the impact of adopting fas 123r to have a significant effect on operations, financial condition or liquidity.   accounting policies   investments   fixed
maturities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks. fixed maturities are valued based upon quoted market prices or dealer quotes, or if quoted market prices or dealer quotes are not available, discounted expected cash flows using market
rates commensurate with the credit quality and maturity of the investment. also included in fixed maturities are loan-backed and structured securities, which are amortized

using the retrospective method. the effective yield used to determine amortization is calculated based upon actual historical and projected future cash
flows, which are obtained from a widely-accepted securities data provider. fixed maturities, including instruments subject to securities lending agreements, are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized
investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income.   equity securities, which include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks, are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value based on quoted
market prices. changes in fair values of equity securities, net of income tax, are charged or credited directly to shareholders equity.   mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost. a mortgage loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect
principal and interest amounts due. for mortgage loans that are determined to be impaired, a reserve is established for the difference between the amortized cost and fair market value of the underlying collateral. in estimating fair value, the
company uses interest rates reflecting the current real estate financing market returns. impaired loans were not significant at december 31, 2004 and 2003.   the companys real estate investments include warehouses and office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly owned. real
estate properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the expected useful life of the building or 39 years. accumulated depreciation on real estate held for
investment purposes was $22 million and $0 at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   the carrying value of real estate properties are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. the review for impairment includes an estimate
of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the real estate property. an impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the real estate
property.   rental income is recognized on a straight line basis
over the lease term. see note 6.   real estate held for sale is
carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. fair value is established at the time of acquisition by internal analysis or external appraisers, using discounted cash flow analyses and other acceptable techniques.
thereafter, impairment is taken if the carrying value of the property exceeds its current fair value less estimated costs to sell. the company had no real estate held for sale at december 31, 2004, and the amount held for sale at december 31, 2003
was not significant.   accrual of income is suspended on fixed
maturities or mortgage loans that are in default, or on which it is likely that future payments will not be made as scheduled. interest income on investments in default is recognized only as payment is received. investments included in the
consolidated balance sheet that were not income-producing for the preceding 12 months were not significant.   short-term securities, consisting primarily of money market instruments and other debt issues purchased with a maturity of less than one year, are carried
at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.   other
investments include: venture capital investments, through direct ownership and limited partnerships; private equity limited partnerships; joint ventures, other limited partnerships, and trading securities. venture capital investments owned directly
are consolidated in the companys financial statements. the company uses the equity method of accounting for joint ventures, limited partnerships and certain private equity securities. undistributed income is reported in net investment income.
trading securities are marked to market with the change in fair value recognized in net investment income during the current period.

investment gains and losses   net realized investment gains and losses are included as a component of pretax revenues based upon specific identification
of the investments sold on the trade date. a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis is assessed to determine if the decline is other-than-temporary. if so, the security is deemed to be impaired, and a charge is recorded in
net realized investment gains and losses equal to the difference between fair value and carrying value.   reinsurance recoverables   amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured business. such recoverables are reported net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance
recoverables and amounts due from known reinsurer insolvencies. the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
insolvencies.   deferred acquisition costs   amounts which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new
insurance contracts, primarily commissions and premium taxes, are deferred and amortized pro rata over the contract periods in which the related premiums are earned. deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from
future income, and if not, are charged to expense. future investment income attributable to related premiums is taken into account in measuring the recoverability of the carrying value of this asset. all other acquisition expenses are charged to
operations as incurred.   contractholder receivables and payables
under certain workers compensation insurance
contracts with deductible features, the company is obligated to pay the claimant for the full amount of the claim. the company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. these amounts are included on a gross basis in
the consolidated balance sheet in contractholder payables and contractholder receivables, respectively.   goodwill and intangible assets   the company adopted fas 141 and fas 142 effective january 1, 2002. upon adoption of fas 141 and fas 142, the company stopped amortizing goodwill. instead, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually using a two-step process. the
first step is performed to identify potential impairment and, if necessary, the second step is performed for the purpose of measuring the amount of impairment, if any. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually.
impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value.   other intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite useful life continue to be amortized over their useful lives. the carrying amount of
intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite useful life is regularly reviewed for indicators of impairments in value in accordance with fas 144. impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not
recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.   claims and claim adjustment expense reserves   claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent estimated provisions for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related expenses. the
reserves are adjusted regularly based upon experience.

included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in the consolidated balance sheet are certain reserves discounted to the present value of
estimated future payments. the liabilities for losses for some long-term disability payments under workers compensation insurance and workers compensation excess insurance, which totaled $2.06 billion and $1.33 billion at december 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, have been discounted using rates of 3.5% to 5.0%. reserves related to certain fixed and determinable asbestos-related settlements, where all payment amounts and their timing are known, were discounted using a range of
interest rates from 2.3% to 5.5% and totaled $48 million and $445 million at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. reserves for certain assumed reinsurance coverage acquired in the merger, discounted using rates of 5.0% to 7.5%, were $116
million at december 31, 2004.   in determining claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves, the company carries on a continuing review of its overall position, its reserving techniques and its reinsurance. the reserves are also reviewed periodically by a qualified actuary employed by the company. these reserves
represent the estimated ultimate cost of all incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses. since the reserves are based on estimates, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such reserves. the effects of changes in such estimated reserves
are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. such changes may be material to the results of operations and financial condition and could occur in a future period.   securities lending payable and dollar-roll repurchase agreements   the company engages in securities lending activities from which it generates
net investment income from the lending of certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. effective april 1, 2004, the company entered into a new securities lending agreement. borrowers of these securities provide
collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. this collateral is held by a third party custodian, and the company has the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution
borrowing the companys securities is in default under the lending agreement. therefore, the company does not recognize the receipt of the collateral held by the third party custodian or the obligation to return the collateral. the loaned
securities remain a recorded asset of the company.   prior to
april 1, 2004, the company engaged in securities lending activities where it received cash and marketable securities as collateral. in those cases where cash collateral was received, the company reinvested the collateral in a short-term investment
pool, the loaned securities remained a recorded asset of the company and a liability was recorded to recognize the companys obligation to return the collateral at the end of the loan. where marketable securities had been received as
collateral, the collateral was held by a third party custodian, and the company had the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution borrowing the companys securities was in default under the lending agreement. in
those cases where marketable securities were received as collateral, the company did not recognize the receipt of the collateral held by the third party custodian or the obligation to return the collateral. the loaned securities remained a recorded
asset of the company.   other liabilities   included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet is the
companys estimate of its liability for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. the liability for expected state guaranty fund and other premium-based assessments is recognized as the company writes or becomes obligated to write
or renew the premiums on which the assessments are expected to be based. the liability for loss-based assessments is recognized as the related losses are incurred. at december 31, 2004 and 2003, the company had a liability of $249 million and $180
million, respectively, for guaranty fund and other assessments and related recoveries of

$31 million and $15 million, respectively. the liability for such assessments and their related recoveries are not discounted for the time value of money.
the assessments are expected to be paid over a period ranging from one year to the life expectancy of certain workers compensation claimants and the recoveries are expected to occur over the same period of time.   also included in other liabilities is an accrual for policyholder dividends.
certain insurance contracts, primarily workers compensation, are participating whereby dividends are paid to policyholders in accordance with contract provisions. net written premiums for participating dividend policies were approximately 1%,
1% and 2% of total company net written premiums for the years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. policyholder dividends are accrued against earnings using best available estimates of amounts to be paid. the liability accrued for
policyholder dividends totaled $28 million and $12 million at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   statutory accounting practices   the companys insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the states of connecticut and minnesota, prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance
departments of the states of domicile. prescribed statutory accounting practices are those practices that are incorporated directly or by reference in state laws, regulations, and general administrative rules applicable to all insurance enterprises
domiciled in a particular state. permitted statutory accounting practices include practices not prescribed by the domiciliary state, but allowed by the domiciliary state regulatory authority. the st. paul fire and marine insurance company (fire and
marine) was granted a permitted practice in 2004 by the minnesota department of commerce regarding the valuation of certain investments in affiliated limited liability companies, allowing it to value these investments based on their audited gaap
equity, which totaled $398 million as of december 31, 2004. it is not practicable to determine the impact on statutory surplus of this permitted practice. the impact of any other permitted accounting practices on statutory surplus of the company is
not material.   premiums and unearned premium reserves   premiums are recognized as revenues pro rata over the policy period.
unearned premium reserves represent the unexpired portion of policy premiums. accrued retrospective premiums are included in premium balances receivable. premium balances receivable are reported net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible
premium amounts.   ceded premiums are charged to income
over the applicable term of the various reinsurance contracts with third party reinsurers. prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as part of other assets.   fee income   fee income includes servicing fees from carriers and revenues from large deductible policies and service contracts and is
recognized pro rata over the contract or policy periods.   asset management
as a result of the merger, the company held a 79%
interest in nuveen investments, inc. (nuveen investments, formerly the john nuveen company), at december 31, 2004. the company consolidates

100% of nuveen investments assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, with reductions on the balance sheet and statement of income (loss) for the
minority shareholders proportionate interest in nuveen investments equity and earnings. minority interest of $123 million was recorded in other liabilities at december 31, 2004.   nuveen investments has three principal sources of revenue: advisory fees on
assets under management, including separately managed accounts, closed-end exchange-traded funds and mutual funds; underwriting and distribution revenues earned upon the sale of certain investment products; and performance fees earned on certain
institutional accounts based on the performance of such accounts. investment advisory fees are recognized as services are provided. with respect to funds, nuveen investments receives fees based either on each funds average daily net assets or
on a combination of the average daily net assets and gross interest income. with respect to managed accounts, nuveen investments generally earns fees, on a quarterly basis, based on the value of the assets managed on a particular date, such as the
last calendar day of a quarter, or on the average asset value for the period.   recoveries from former affiliate   recoveries
from former affiliate consist of the recoveries under the citigroup indemnification agreement.   other revenues   other
revenues include revenues from premium installment charges, which are recognized as collected, revenues of noninsurance subsidiaries other than fee income and gains and losses on dispositions of assets and operations other than net realized
investment gains and losses.   income taxes   the company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. the effect of a change in tax laws or
rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized.   foreign currency translation
the company assigns functional currencies to its foreign operations,
which are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the functional currency, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in the statement of income (loss). functional
currency amounts are then translated into u.s. dollars. the unrealized gain or loss from this translation, net of tax, is recorded as a part of shareholders equity. the change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the
year, net of tax, is a component of comprehensive income. both the remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for the balance sheets and average exchange rates for the statements of operations.   stock-based compensation   the company has an employee stock incentive compensation plan that includes
stock-based awards of stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock.

for stock-based employee awards granted, modified, or settled after december 31, 2002, the company
applies the fas 123 fair value method of accounting. under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognized ratably over the vesting period. for restricted stock the fair value is
measured at the market price of a share on the grant date while for stock options the fair value is derived by the application of an option pricing model at date of grant.   for stock-based employee awards granted prior to january 1, 2003, the company accounts for these awards under the
recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no. 25 (apb25), accounting for stock issued to employees, and related interpretations. the company continues to apply the apb 25 accounting
guidance for these awards as the company elected to use the prospective recognition transition alternative of fas 148. under this method, compensation cost is measured at grant date based upon the market value of the underlying stock at the date of
grant less any amount that the employee is required to pay and recognized ratably over the vesting period. for employee restricted stock awards, the awards are granted at the market value of the underlying stock on grant date and accordingly the
market value of these awards is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. for employee stock option awards, the awards are granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
the grant and accordingly there has been no employee compensation expense recognized in earnings for the stock option awards granted prior to adoption of the fas 123 fair value method of accounting on january 1, 2003.   in connection with the merger in april 2004, the company assumed 23 million
outstanding spc stock options, of which 4 million remained unvested and assumed approximately 240,000 of outstanding spc restricted stock awards related to spc equity-based compensation plans. these stock options and restricted stock awards retained
the same terms and conditions that were applicable prior to the merger. at april 1, 2004, the estimated fair values of the unvested stock option awards and the restricted stock awards were $35 million and $9 million, respectively, and are included
in unearned compensation as a separate component of equity. the unearned compensation expense is being recognized as a charge to income over the remaining vesting period.   additionally, in conjunction with the citigroup distribution in august 2002 (described in more detail in note 3), the
company issued replacement awards for citigroup awards. these replacement awards were issued at the intrinsic value of each citigroup option and the ratio of exercise price per share to the market value per share was not reduced. accordingly there
was no compensation cost recognized in earnings for these replacement awards.

financial futures, as a means of hedging exposure to interest rate, equity price change and foreign currency risk. the companys insurance subsidiaries do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. the company recognizes all
derivatives, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. where applicable, hedge accounting is used to account
for derivatives. to qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in value of the derivative must be expected to substantially offset the changes in value of the hedged item. hedges are monitored to ensure that there is a high correlation between the
derivative instruments and the hedged investment. derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with the changes in market value reflected in the consolidated statement of income in net realized investment gains (losses).

and forward contracts were not significant at december 31, 2004 and 2003.   nature of operations   upon completion of the
merger on april 1, 2004, the company was organized into four reportable business segments: commercial, specialty, personal (these three segments collectively represent the companys insurance segments) and asset management. the insurance
segments reflect how the company manages its property and casualty insurance products and insurance-related services and represent an aggregation of these products and services based on type of customer, how the business is marketed, and the manner
in which the business is underwritten. the asset management segment comprises the companys 79% interest in nuveen investments.

for periods prior to the april 1, 2004 merger completion date, segments have been restated from the
historical presentation of tpc to conform to the new segment presentation of the company, where practicable. as a result, prior period bond and construction results were reclassified from the historical tpc commercial lines segment to the historical
specialty segment.    invested and other assets and net
investment income (nii) of historical tpc had been specifically identified by reporting segment prior to the merger. beginning in the second quarter of 2004, the company developed a methodology to allocate nii and invested assets to the identified
segments. this methodology allocates pretax nii based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment. the investment yield for investable
funds reflects the duration of the loss reserves future cash flows, the interest rate environment at the time the losses were incurred and a+ rated corporate debt instruments. this duration yield will be compared to the average portfolio yield
and a new average yield will be determined. it is this average yield that will be used in the calculation of nii on investable funds. yields will be updated annually. invested assets are allocated to segments in proportion to the pretax allocation
of nii. it is not practicable to apply this methodology to historical businesses and, as such, actual (versus allocated) nii is included in revenues and operating income of the restated segments for periods prior to the merger. the company
believes that the differences are not significant to a comparison with the new segment presentation. it is also not practicable to present total assets for restated commercial and specialty segments for periods prior to the merger.
the specific attributes of the companys four reportable
business segments are as follows:    commercial
the commercial segment offers a broad array of property
and casualty insurance and insurance-related services to its clients. commercial is organized into three marketing and underwriting groups, each of which focuses on a particular client base and which collectively comprise commercials core
operations. the marketing and underwriting groups include the following:
commercial accounts serves primarily mid-sized businesses for casualty products and large and mid- sized businesses for property products.
select accounts serves small businesses and offers property, liability, commercial auto and workers compensation insurance.
national accounts provides casualty products and services to large companies, with particular emphasis on workers compensation, general liability and automobile
liability. national accounts also includes the companys residual market business, which primarily offers workers compensation products and services to the involuntary market.   commercial also includes the special liability group (which manages the
companys asbestos and environmental liabilities); the reinsurance, health care, and certain international runoff operations; and policies written by the companys wholly-owned subsidiary gulf insurance company (gulf), which was placed
into runoff during the second quarter of the year. these operations are collectively referred to as commercial other.

damage, and for physical damage to an insureds own vehicle from collision and various other perils. in addition, many states require policies to provide first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.
homeowners policies are available for dwellings, condominiums,
mobile homes and rental property contents. protection against losses to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils is included in these policies, as well as coverage for liability arising from ownership or occupancy.   net written premiums by product line were as follows:

asset management
the asset management segment is comprised of the
companys majority interest in nuveen investments, inc., whose core businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent,
high-net-worth and institutional market segments. nuveen investments distributes its investment products and services, including individually managed accounts, closed-end exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, to the affluent and high-net-worth
market segments through unaffiliated intermediary firms including broker/dealers, commercial banks, affiliates of insurance providers, financial planners, accountants, consultants and investment advisors. nuveen investments also provides managed
account services to several institutional market segments and channels. nuveen investments markets its capabilities under four distinct brands: rittenhouse (blue-chip growth-style equities); nwq (value-style equities);
nuveen (fixed-income investments); and symphony (an institutional manager of market-neutral alternative investment portfolios). nuveen investments is listed on the new york stock exchange, trading under the symbol jnc. the
companys interest in nuveen investments was approximately 79% at december 31, 2004.   catastrophe exposure   the company has geographic exposure to catastrophe losses in certain areas of the country. catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made events including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather,
explosions and fires. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of
the event. most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. the company generally seeks to reduce its
exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance.   on november 26, 2002, the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 (the terrorism act) was enacted into federal law and established the terrorism insurance
program (the program), a temporary federal program in the department of the treasury, that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a
foreign interest. in order for a loss to be covered under the program (subject losses), the loss must be the result of an event that is certified as an act

of terrorism by the u.s. secretary of treasury. in the case of a war declared by congress, only workers compensation losses are covered by the
terrorism act. the terrorism act generally requires that all commercial property casualty insurers licensed in the united states participate in the program. the program terminates on december 31, 2005. under the program, a participating insurer is
entitled to be reimbursed by the federal government for 90% of subject losses, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap. in each case, the deductible percentage is applied to the insurers subject direct earned premiums from the
calendar year immediately preceding the applicable year. the deductible under the program was 7% for 2003, 10% for 2004 and is 15% for 2005. the program also contains an annual cap that limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all
participating insurers to $100 billion. once subject losses have reached the $100 billion aggregate during a program year, there is no additional reimbursement from the u.s. treasury and an insurer that has met its deductible for the program year is
not liable for any losses (or portion thereof) that exceed the $100 billion cap. the companys estimated deductible under this federal program is $2.51 billion for 2005. the company had no terrorism-related losses in 2004 or 2003. if the
program is not renewed for periods after january 1, 2006, the benefits of the program will not be available to the company, and the company will be subject to losses from acts of terrorism subject only to the terms and provisions of applicable
policies.

merger and acquisition   merger with spc   on april 1, 2004, tpc merged with a subsidiary of spc, as a result of which tpc became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the st. paul travelers companies, inc.
for accounting purposes, this transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with tpc treated as the accounting acquirer. accordingly, this transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination, using tpcs historical
financial information and applying fair value estimates to the acquired assets, liabilities and commitments of spc as of april 1, 2004.    determination of purchase price   the stock price used in determining the purchase price was based on an average of the closing prices of spc common stock for the two trading days before
through the two trading days after spc and tpc announced their merger agreement on november 17, 2003. the purchase price also includes the fair value of the spc stock options, the fair value adjustment to spcs preferred stock, and other costs
of the transaction. the purchase price was approximately $8.76 billion, and was calculated as follows:

the primary reasons for the acquisition were, among other things, a) to create a stronger company
that will provide significant benefits to shareholders and to customers alike; b) to capitalize on a common strategic focus on delivering the highest value to customers, agents and brokers and, working together, to expand future opportunities and
capture new efficiencies; and c) to strengthen the combined companys position as a leading provider of property and casualty insurance products.   allocation of the purchase price   the purchase price has been allocated based on an estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of april 1, 2004, as

an adjustment has been applied to spcs claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables at the acquisition date to estimate their
fair value. the fair value adjustment of $191 million was based on managements estimate of nominal claim and claim expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables (after adjusting for conformity with the acquirers accounting policy on
discounting of workers compensation reserves), expected payment patterns, the april 1, 2004 u.s. treasury spot rate yield curve, a leverage ratio assumption (reserves to statutory surplus), and a cost of capital expressed as a spread over
risk-free rates. the method used calculates a risk adjustment to a risk-free discounted reserve that will, if reserves run off as expected, produce results that yield the assumed cost-of-capital on the capital

supporting the loss reserves. the fair value adjustment is reported as an intangible asset on the consolidated balance sheet, and the amounts measured in
accordance with the acquirers accounting policies for insurance contracts are reported as part of the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. the intangible asset will be recognized into income over the
expected payment pattern. because the time value of money and the risk adjustment (cost of capital) components of the intangible asset run off at different rates, the amount recognized in income may be a net benefit in some periods and a net expense
in other periods.   identification and valuation of

tpc corporate reorganization   in 2002, tpc effected a corporate reorganization under which it transferred substantially all of its assets to affiliates of its then parent company,
citigroup inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, citigroup), other than the capital stock of travelers insurance group holdings inc. (tighi). citigroup also assumed all of tpcs third-party liabilities, other than liabilities
relating to tighi and tighis active employee. tpc then effected a recapitalization whereby the previously outstanding shares of its common stock (1,500 shares), all of which were owned by citigroup, were changed into 269 million shares of
class a common stock and 500 million shares of class b common stock. finally, tpc amended and restated its certificate of incorporation and bylaws.   as a result of these transactions, tighi and its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries became tpcs principal asset.   on march 21, 2002, tpc issued 231 million shares of its class a common stock
in an initial public offering (ipo), representing approximately 23% of tpcs common equity. after the ipo, citigroup beneficially owned all of the 500 million shares of tpcs outstanding class b common stock, each share of which is
entitled to seven votes, and 269 million shares of tpcs class a common stock, each share of which is entitled to one vote, representing at the time 94% of the combined voting power of all classes of tpcs voting securities and 77% of the
equity interest in tpc. (all class a and class b share amounts presented are unadjusted for the merger of tpc and spc). concurrent with the ipo, tpc issued $893 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% convertible junior subordinated notes which
mature on april 15, 2032. the ipo and the offering of the convertible notes are collectively referred to as the offerings.   pursuant to tpcs corporate reorganization, which was completed on march 19, 2002, tpcs consolidated financial statements were adjusted to
exclude the accounts of certain formerly wholly-owned tpc subsidiaries, principally the travelers insurance company (tic) and its subsidiaries, certain other wholly-owned noninsurance subsidiaries of tpc and substantially all of tpcs assets
and certain liabilities not related to the property casualty business.   pursuant to tpcs corporate reorganization, tpcs consolidated financial statements included the accounts of its primary subsidiary, tighi, a property casualty insurance holding company. also included were the accounts of
citiinsurance international holdings inc. and its subsidiaries (citiinsurance), the principal assets of which are investments in the property casualty and life operations of fubon insurance co., ltd. and fubon assurance co., ltd., with respect to
results prior to march 1, 2002.   citigroup distribution of ownership
interest in tpc   on august 20, 2002, citigroup made a
tax-free distribution to its stockholders (the citigroup distribution), of a portion of its ownership interest in tpc, which, together with the shares issued in the ipo, represented more than 90% of tpcs common equity and more than 90% of the
combined voting power of tpcs outstanding voting securities. for each 100 shares of citigroup outstanding common stock, approximately 4.32 shares of tpc class a common stock and 8.88 shares of tpc class b common stock were distributed. at
december 31, 2004, citigroup held for its own account approximately 6.50% of the companys outstanding common stock. at december 31, 2003 and 2002, citigroup held for its own account 9.87% and 9.95%, respectively, of tpcs common equity
and 9.87% and 9.98%, respectively, of the combined voting power of tpcs outstanding voting securities. citigroup received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service that the citigroup distribution was tax-free to citigroup, its
stockholders and tpc. as part of the ruling process, citigroup agreed to vote the shares it continued to hold following the citigroup distribution pro rata with the shares held by the

shares of the companys common stock.   on august 20, 2002,
in connection with the citigroup distribution, stock-based awards held by tpc employees on that date under citigroups various incentive plans were cancelled and replaced by awards under tpcs own incentive programs (see note 13 to the
companys consolidated financial statements for a further discussion), which awards were granted on substantially the same terms, including vesting, as the former citigroup awards.   other tpc corporate reorganization, offerings and citigroup distribution transactions   the following transactions were completed in conjunction with the 2002
corporate reorganization, offerings and citigroup distribution:   in february 2002, tpc paid a dividend of $1.00 billion to citigroup in the form of a non-interest bearing note payable on december 31, 2002. tpc repaid this note on december 31, 2002. also in february 2002, tpc paid an additional dividend
of $3.70 billion to citigroup in the form of a note payable in two installments. this note was substantially prepaid following the offerings. the balance of $150 million was due on may 9, 2004. the remaining portion of this note was prepaid on may
8, 2002. in march 2002, tpc paid a dividend of $395 million to citigroup in the form of a note. this note was prepaid following the offerings.   at december 31, 2001, tpc had a note payable to citigroup in the amount of $1.20 billion, in conjunction with its purchase of tighis outstanding
shares in april 2000. on february 7, 2002, this note agreement was replaced by a new note agreement. under the terms of the new note agreement, interest accrued on the aggregate principal amount outstanding at the commercial paper rate (the then
current short-term rate) plus 10 basis points per annum. interest was compounded monthly. this note was prepaid following the offerings.   during march 2002, tpc entered into an agreement with citigroup (the citigroup indemnification agreement) which provided that in any year in which tpc
recorded additional asbestos-related income statement charges in excess of $150 million, net of any reinsurance, citigroup would pay to tpc the amount of any such excess up to a cumulative aggregate of $800 million, reduced by the tax effect of the
highest applicable federal income tax rate. during 2002, tpc recorded $2.95 billion of asbestos incurred losses, net of reinsurance, and accordingly fully utilized in 2002 the total benefit available under the agreement. for the year ended december
31, 2002, revenues included $520 million from citigroup under this agreement. included in federal income taxes in the consolidated statement of income for 2002 was a tax benefit of $280 million related to the asbestos charge covered by the
agreement. for additional information see asbestos claims and litigation.   on february 28, 2002, tpc sold citiinsurance to other citigroup affiliated companies for $403 million, its net book value. tpc applied $138 million of the proceeds from this sale to repay intercompany indebtedness to
citigroup. in addition, tpc purchased from citigroup affiliated companies the premises located at one tower square, hartford, connecticut and other properties for $68 million. additionally, certain liabilities relating to employee benefit plans and
lease obligations were assigned and assumed by citigroup affiliated companies. in connection with these assignments, tpc transferred $172 million and $88 million, respectively, to citigroup affiliated companies.   prior to the 2002 citigroup distribution, tpc provided and purchased services
to and from citigroup affiliated companies, including facilities management, banking and financial functions, benefit coverages, data

tradenames in an amendment to the march 26, 2002 intercompany agreement with citigroup. during the first quarter of 2002, citigroup provided investment advisory services on an allocated cost basis, consistent with prior years. on august 6, 2002, tpc
entered into an investment management agreement, which was applied retroactive to april 1, 2002, with an affiliate of citigroup whereby the affiliate of citigroup provided investment advisory and administrative services to tpc, with respect to its
entire investment portfolio for a period of two years and at fees mutually agreed upon, including a component based on investment performance. this agreement was modified and extended through the first quarter of 2005. charges incurred related to
this agreement were $58 million for the year ended december 31, 2004, $60 million for the year ended december 31, 2003 and $47 million for the period from april 1, 2002 through december 31, 2002.

the company makes investments in collateralized mortgage obligations (cmos) that typically have high
credit quality, offer good liquidity and are expected to provide an advantage in yield compared to u.s. treasury securities. the companys investment strategy is to purchase cmo tranches which offer the most favorable return given the risks
involved. one significant risk evaluated is prepayment sensitivity. the company does invest in other types of cmo tranches if a careful assessment indicates a favorable risk/return tradeoff. the company does not purchase residual interests in cmos.
at december 31, 2004 and 2003, the company held cmos
classified as available for sale with a fair value of $3.30 billion and $3.06 billion, respectively (excluding commercial mortgage-backed securities of $953 million and $875 million, respectively). approximately 53% and 60% of the companys cmo
holdings are guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by gnma, fnma or fhlmc at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. in addition, the company held $4.66 billion and $3.80 billion of gnma, fnma, fhlmc or fha mortgage-backed
pass-through securities classified as available for sale at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. virtually all of these securities are rated aaa.   at december 31, 2004, the company had $2.60 billion of securities on loan as part of a tri-party lending agreement, and at december 31, 2003, the company
had $562 million of securities on loan for which cash collateral was received. at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, $32 million and $135 million of securities were subject to dollar-roll repurchase agreements.    proceeds from sales of fixed maturities classified as available for sale were
$7.95 billion, $8.34 billion and $12.52 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. gross gains of $202 million, $282 million and $571 million and gross losses of $126 million, $147 million and $148 million were realized on those sales in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.    at december 31, 2004 and
2003, the companys insurance subsidiaries had $3.39 billion and $2.37 billion, respectively, of securities on deposit at financial institutions in certain states pursuant to the respective states insurance regulatory authorities.
the companys subsidiaries, unionamerica and st. paul
re-u.k., and the companys operations at lloyds (all acquired in the merger) are required, as accredited u.s. reinsurers, to hold certain investments in trust in the united states. these trust funds had a fair value of $359 million at
december 31, 2004. additionally, unionamerica, st. paul re-u.k. and discover re have funds deposited with third parties to be used as collateral to secure various liabilities on behalf of insureds, cedants and other creditors. these funds had a fair
value of $55 million at december 31, 2004. there is also $95 million of other investments being used as collateral to secure our obligations under a series of insurance transactions.   equity securities   the cost and fair value of investments in equity securities were as follows:

impairments   fixed maturities and equity securities   an investment in a fixed maturity or equity security which is available for
sale is impaired if its fair value falls below its book value and the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary. factors considered in determining whether a decline is other-than-temporary include the length of time and the extent to which
fair value has been below cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery.   additionally, for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash
flows (including asset-backed securities), eitf 99-20, recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, requires the company to periodically update its best estimate
of cash flows over the life of the security. if management determines that the fair value of its securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the
last revised estimate, considering both timing and amount, then an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized.

a fixed maturity security is impaired if it is probable that the company will not be able to collect
all amounts due under the securitys contractual terms. equity securities are impaired when it becomes apparent that the company will not recover its cost over the expected holding period. further, for securities expected to be sold, an
other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized if the company does not expect the fair value of a security to recover prior to the expected date of sale.
the companys process for reviewing invested assets for impairments during any quarter includes the following:
identification and evaluation of investments which have possible indications of impairment;
analysis of investments with gross unrealized investment losses that have fair values less than 80% of amortized cost during successive quarterly periods over a rolling one-year
period;
review of portfolio manager(s) recommendations for other-than-temporary impairments based on the investees current financial condition, liquidity, near-term recovery prospects
and other factors, as well as consideration of other investments that were not recommended for other-than-temporary impairments;
consideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of factors or triggers that would or could cause individual investments to qualify as having other-than-temporary
impairments and those that would not support other-than-temporary impairment; and
determination of the status of each analyzed investment as other than temporary or not, with documentation of the rationale for the decision.   venture capital investments   other investments include venture capital investments acquired in the
merger, which are generally non-publicly traded instruments in early-stage companies and, historically, having a holding period of four to seven years. these investments have primarily been made in the health care, software and computer services,
and networking and information technologies infrastructures industries. the company typically is involved with venture capital companies early in their formation, as they are developing and determining the viability of, and market demand for, their
product. generally, the company does not expect these venture capital companies to record revenues in the early stages of their development, which can often take three to four years, and does not generally expect them to become profitable for an
even longer period of time. with respect to the companys valuation of such non-publicly traded venture capital investments, on a quarterly basis, portfolio managers as well as an internal valuation committee review and consider a variety of
factors in determining the potential for loss impairment. factors considered include the following:
the issuers most recent financing events;
an analysis of whether fundamental deterioration has occurred;
whether or not the issuers progress has been substantially less than expected;
whether or not the valuations have declined significantly in the entitys market sector;
whether or not the internal valuation committee believes it is probable that the issuer will need financing within six months at a lower price than our carrying value; and
whether or not the company has the ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery, enabling it to receive value equal to or greater
than our cost.

earnings per share   earnings per share (eps) has been computed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. 128, earnings per share (fas 128).
basic eps is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. the computation of diluted eps reflects the effect of potentially dilutive securities.
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
applicable to basic and diluted eps for all periods prior to april 1, 2004 have been restated to reflect the exchange of each share of tpc common stock for 0.4334 shares of the companys common stock.   as discussed in more detail in note 1 of this report, the company implemented
the provisions of fasb emerging issues task force (eitf) 04-8, the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share, which provided new guidance on the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt instruments. net
income per diluted share for the year ended december 31, 2004 excluded the weighted average effects of the 4.50% convertible junior subordinated notes convertible into 16.7 million shares of common stock as the impact would be anti-dilutive. net
income per diluted share for the year ended december 31, 2003 was restated from $3.88 to $3.80, while net income per diluted share for the year ended december 31, 2002 was not restated as the impact would be anti-dilutive.

reinsurance   the companys consolidated financial statements reflect the effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions. assumed reinsurance refers to the
acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies have underwritten. ceded reinsurance involves transferring certain insurance risks (along with the related written and earned premiums) the company has underwritten to other
insurance companies who agree to share these risks. the primary purpose of ceded reinsurance is to protect the company from potential losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept. reinsurance is placed on both a quota-share and excess of
loss basis. ceded reinsurance arrangements do not discharge the company as the primary insurer, except for cases involving a novation.   the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to
significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the company may become involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. in recent years, the company has experienced an increase in the frequency of
these reinsurance coverage disputes. some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the companys rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. the company
employs dedicated specialists and strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.   the company is also required to participate in various involuntary reinsurance arrangements through assumed reinsurance, principally with regard to
residual market mechanisms in workers compensation. the company provides services for several of these involuntary arrangements (mandatory pools and associations) under which it writes such residual market business directly, then
cedes 100% of this business to the mandatory pool. such servicing arrangements are arranged to protect the company from any credit risk, as any ceded balances are jointly backed by all the pool members.   the company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for
estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. the allowance is based upon the companys ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and
other relevant factors. accordingly, the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. amounts deemed to be uncollectible,
including amounts due from known insolvent reinsurers, are written off against the allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. any subsequent collections of amounts previously written off are reported as part of underwriting
results.   the allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance
recoverables was $751 million and $387 million at december 31, 2004 and december 31, 2003, respectively. of the $364 million increase in 2004, $256 million was merger-related and $108 million resulted from the companys ongoing review process
described above.   the company assumed 100% of the workers
compensation premiums previously written by the accident department of its former affiliate, the travelers insurance company (tic).   certain of the assumed reinsurance contracts that the company has entered into with non-affiliated companies on an excess of loss basis do not transfer
insurance risk. these contracts are accounted for using deposit accounting and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and totaled $405 million and $325 million at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

the company entered
into commutation agreements with a major reinsurer, effective june 30, 2004, resulting in a charge of $153 million for amounts received less than the reinsurance recoverable balances of approximately $1.26 billion. in connection with the
commutation, the company also entered into a new reinsurance agreement effective april 1, 2004, that provides $300 million aggregate coverage for the 2000 accident year exposures written by spc. because the new agreement is for events occurring
prior to the effective date of the agreement, the resulting $59 million gain has been deferred and will be recognized in earnings as amounts are recovered from the reinsurer. under the terms of these agreements, the company received net cash of
approximately $867 million.   in 1996, lloyds of london
(lloyds) restructured its operations with respect to claims for years prior to 1993 and reinsured these claims into equitas limited (equitas). amounts recoverable from unaffiliated insurers at december 31, 2004 and 2003 included $90 million
and $269 million, respectively, recoverable from equitas. during the first quarter of 2004, tpc entered into an agreement to settle all current and future reinsurance claims against certain underwriters at lloyds reinsured by equitas. under
terms of this settlement, the company received $245 million, resolving approximately $255 million of tpcs net claim balances from equitas. virtually all of the $90 million reinsurance recoverables relating to equitas remaining at december 31,
2004 relate to spc.

spc net claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at april 1, 2004. spc gross reserves at that date were $19.50 billion. spc reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses at april 1,
2004 were $5.85 billion.   gross claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves at december 31, 2004 increased by $24.51 billion over year-end 2003, primarily as a result of the merger with spc and reserve charges recorded subsequent to the merger. of the increase in 2004, $19.50 billion resulted
from the addition of the acquired operations, and $2.40 billion was due to estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in prior years, which is described in more detail in the discussion that follows.   the increase in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in 2003
from 2002 was primarily due to net prior year reserve strengthening, principally in commercial, and growth in business volume in both commercial and personal. partially offsetting the above were net payments of $607 million in 2003 and $522 million
in 2002 for asbestos and environmental claims, and favorable prior year reserve development for personal.

prior year development   in 2004, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in prior years totaled a net $2.40 billion,
including $2.39 billion of net unfavorable prior year reserve development impacting the companys results of operations, excluding $75 million of accretion of discount. pretax net unfavorable prior year reserve development included $928 million
to strengthen asbestos reserves primarily as a result of the completion of the companys annual asbestos liability review in the fourth quarter, $290 million to strengthen environmental reserves, reserve adjustments related to the merger of
$500 million for construction and $300 million for surety, $252 million related to a specific construction contractor, $113 million related to the commutation of agreements with a major reinsurer, and other net reserving actions   the asbestos provision primarily resulted from an increase in litigation
costs and activity surrounding peripheral defendants. with regard to the environmental provision, new claims for hazardous waste and pollution continue to decline, though the pace of the decrease has slowed. the average severity of claims has
increased, however, leading the company to conclude that reserves for environmental losses needed to be increased. the majority of the asbestos and environmental provision is included in the commercial segment. also included in net unfavorable prior
year reserve development of $1.18 billion in the commercial segment was $38 million related to the commutation of agreements with a major reinsurer along with a strengthening of gulf reserves, which was more than offset by favorable prior year
reserve development in core commercial operations due to reductions in the frequency of non-catastrophe related losses.   the specialty segment recorded prior year reserve development of $1.59 billion and included $500 million and $300 million of net unfavorable prior year
reserve development related to the construction and surety reserves, respectively, acquired in the merger, as well as a $252 million charge related to a specific construction contractor and $75 million related to the commutation of agreements with a
major reinsurer. results in 2004 also reflected $150 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development recorded in tpcs construction operation prior to the merger, other reserve increases, and a charge to increase the allowance for
estimated amounts due from a co-surety on a specific construction contractor claim.   in the personal segment, net favorable prior year reserve development was $378 million, driven by a decline in the frequency of non-catastrophe homeowners losses, as well as a reduction in the frequency and
severity of losses in the automobile line of business.   in
2003, net unfavorable prior year reserve development included in estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses totaled $390 million. that amount included $549 million of net unfavorable development impacting the companys results of operations
that primarily resulted from $521 million of reserve strengthening at gulf insurance company, a subsidiary that wrote specialty insurance prior to being placed in runoff in 2004. the net 2003 total also included unfavorable development related to
american equity, an operation that was placed in run-off in the second quarter of 2002, and environmental claims. those provisions were partially offset by net favorable development in other commercial businesses, principally property coverages, in
which the company experienced lower non-catastrophe-related claim frequency. in 2003, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in prior years included $42 million of net favorable loss development on commercial loss
sensitive policies in various lines; however, since the business to which it relates was subject to premium adjustments, there was no impact on results of operations.   in addition, personal recorded $162 million in net favorable prior year reserve development in 2003 principally due to
continued reduced levels of non-catastrophe claim frequency in both homeowners and non-bodily injury automobile businesses, and a $50 million reduction in reserves held related to the terrorist attack on september 11, 2001.

in 2002, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in prior years was a net
unfavorable development of $3.03 billion. this included $3.13 billion of net unfavorable development which impacted results of operations primarily due to unfavorable development of $2.95 billion related to asbestos. claims arising in prior years
for 2002 also included unfavorable development of $150 million related to environmental claims and favorable development of $100 million related to cumulative injury claims. in addition, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims
arising in prior years included net unfavorable development, primarily related to certain commercial coverages, predominantly in assumed reinsurance specialty businesses, partially offset by favorable development in commercial workers
compensation and personal automobile. in 2002, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in prior years included $71 million of net favorable loss development on commercial loss sensitive policies in various lines; however,
since the business to which it relates is subject to premium adjustments, there is no impact on results of operations.   for each of the years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, changes in allocations between accident years of loss adjustment expenses, pursuant to
regulatory reporting requirements, are included in claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in prior years and did not impact results of operations.   the fair value adjustments to the acquired claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables as of
april 1, 2004, the merger date, are reported as intangible assets and are being amortized over the expected payout period of the acquired reserves. see note 2.
asbestos and environmental reserves   at december 31, 2004 and 2003, the companys claims and claim adjustment expense reserves included $4.57 billion and $3.27 billion, respectively, for
asbestos and environmental-related claims, net of reinsurance.   it is difficult to estimate the reserves for asbestos and environmental-related claims due to the vagaries of court coverage decisions, plaintiffs expanded theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation and other
uncertainties, including without limitation, those which are set forth below.   because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the company generally evaluates the asbestos exposure presented by each policyholder on a policyholder-by-policyholder basis. in the course
of this evaluation, the company considers: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of each policyholders potential
liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if
any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation
claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. when the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and related claim adjustment expense is determined for a policyholder, the company calculates, by each policy
year, a ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, as well as past ceded experience and reinsurance collections. conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves. the
companys evaluations have not resulted in any data from which a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment may be determined.   with respect to asbestos exposures, the company also compares its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any
emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. net asbestos losses and expenses paid in 2004 were $301 million, compared with $452

insurance claims reserves, continued
million in 2003. approximately 22% in 2004 and 57% in 2003 of total net paid losses relate to policyholders with whom the company previously entered into
settlement agreements that would limit the companys liability. the decrease in the percentage of net paid settlements to total paid losses in 2004 primarily reflected an increase in reinsurance billings in 2004, which related to gross payments
made in prior periods. in 2004, gross payments associated with policyholders with settlement agreements totaled $199 million, compared with $289 million in 2003.   at december 31, 2004, asbestos reserves, net of reinsurance, were $3.93 billion, compared with $2.98 billion as of december
31, 2003. the company acquired $311 million of net asbestos reserves in the merger with spc. net incurred asbestos losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $928 million in 2004, driven by a $922 million provision to strengthen reserves in the
fourth quarter following completion of the companys annual ground-up review of asbestos exposures. that review included an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder
bankruptcies, state judicial rulings and legislative actions. the $922 million provision was largely driven by an increase in litigation costs and activity surrounding peripheral defendants.   at december 31, 2003, asbestos reserves were $2.98 billion compared to $3.40
billion as of december 31, 2002. the decrease primarily reflected the $452 million of payments made during the course of 2003, partly offset by accretion of discounts of $25 million on reserves for certain policyholders with structured agreements.
other than accretion of discounts, there were no additions to asbestos reserves in 2003 compared to an addition of $2.95 billion in 2002.   in march 2002, citigroup entered into an agreement under which it provided tpc with financial support for asbestos claims and related litigation, in any
year that tpcs insurance subsidiaries record asbestos-related income statement charges in excess of $150 million, net of any reinsurance, up to a cumulative aggregate of $800 million, reduced by the tax effect of the highest applicable federal
income tax rate. during 2002, tpc recorded $2.95 billion of asbestos incurred losses, net of reinsurance, and accordingly has fully utilized the total benefit available under the agreement.   in establishing environmental reserves, the company evaluates the exposure
presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. in the course of this analysis, the company considers the probable liability, available coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar
exposures. in addition, the company considers the many variables presented, such as the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the allegations of environmental harm at each site; the number of sites; the total number of
potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of
the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage,
including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims, in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. conventional actuarial techniques are not used to
estimate these reserves. in 2004, the company recorded a pretax charge of $290 million, net of reinsurance, to increase environmental reserves due to revised estimates of costs related to recent settlement initiatives. net environmental losses paid
were $152 million, $155 million and $161 million for the years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.   as a result of the processes and procedures described above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims at
december 31, 2004 are appropriately established based upon known

insurance claims reserves, continued
facts, current law and managements judgment. however, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is presently
not possible to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing
uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or
decrease in asbestos and environmental claims which cannot now be anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of some disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for
asbestos claims in a manner inconsistent with the companys previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the company and future developments pertaining to the companys ability to recover
reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims. in addition, the company sees, as an emerging trend, an increase in the companys asbestos-related loss and loss expense experience as a result of the exhaustion or unavailability due to
insolvency of other insurance potentially available to policyholders along with the insolvency or bankruptcy of other defendants. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future
development of asbestos and environmental claims. this development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of large coverage
disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often
involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos reserves, which includes an annual ground-up review of asbestos policyholders, the company continues to
study the implications of these and other developments.   because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, the companys estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change.
these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the companys results of operations and financial condition
in future periods.

description of debt
commercial paperthe company maintains an $800 million
commercial paper program with $1 billion of back-up liquidity, consisting entirely of bank credit agreements. interest rates on commercial paper issued in 2004 ranged from 1.1% to 2.8%.   medium-term notesthe medium-term notes outstanding at december 31, 2004 bear interest rates ranging from 6.4%
to 7.4%, with a weighted average rate of 6.8%. maturities range from 5 to 15 years after the issuance dates. during 2004, medium-term notes having a par value of $59 million matured or were repurchased.   5.25% senior notesin july 2002, concurrent with the issuance of
17.8 million of spc common shares in a public offering, spc issued 8.9 million equity units, each having a stated amount of $50, for gross consideration of $443 million. each equity unit initially consists of a forward purchase contract for the
companys common stock (maturing in july 2005), and an unsecured $50 senior note of the company (maturing in 2007). total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of 9.00%, consisting of interest on the note at a rate of 5.25%
and fee payments under the forward contract of 3.75%. the forward contract requires the investor to purchase, for $50, a variable number of shares of the companys common stock on the settlement date of august 16, 2005. the number of shares to
be purchased will be determined based on a formula that considers the average trading price of the companys stock immediately prior to the time of settlement in relation to the $24.20 per share price of common stock at the time of the
offering. had the settlement date been december 31, 2004, the company would have issued approximately 15 million common shares based on the average trading price of the companys common stock immediately prior to that date.

nuveen investments debtin september 2003, nuveen investments issued $300 million
of 4.22% notes in a private placement. the notes mature in 2008. a portion of the proceeds was used to refinance existing debt and repay a $105 million loan from spc. the remainder was used for nuveen investments general corporate purposes.
the carrying value of nuveen investments debt in the foregoing table included the unamortized gains from the cancellation of prior interest rate swap transactions in connection with the private placement, as well as unamortized private
placement debt issue costs.   zero coupon convertible
notesthe zero coupon convertible notes mature in 2009, but are redeemable at the option of the holder for an amount equal to the original issue price plus accreted original issue discount.   3.75%, 5.00%, 6.375% senior noteson march 11, 2003, the company
issued $1.40 billion of senior notes comprising $400 million of 3.75% senior notes due march 15, 2008, $500 million of 5.00% senior notes due march 15, 2013 and $500 million of 6.375% senior notes due march 15, 2033. the notes pay interest
semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning september 15, 2003, are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the companys other senior unsecured indebtedness. the company may redeem some or all of the
notes prior to maturity by paying a make-whole premium based on u.s. treasury rates. the net proceeds from the sale of these notes were contributed to tighi, so that tighi could prepay and refinance $500 million of 3.60% indebtedness to
citigroup and to redeem $900 million aggregate principal amount of tighis 8.00% to 8.08% junior subordinated debt securities held by subsidiary trusts. these trusts, in turn, used these funds to redeem $900 million of preferred capital
securities on april 9, 2003.   these senior notes were sold to
qualified institutional buyers as defined under rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 (the securities act) and outside the united states in reliance on regulation s under the securities act. accordingly, the notes (the restricted notes) were
not registered under the securities act or any state securities laws and could not be transferred or resold except pursuant to certain exemptions. as part of this offering, the company agreed to file a registration statement under the securities act
to permit the exchange of the notes for registered notes (the exchange notes) having terms identical to those of the senior notes described above (exchange offer). on april 14, 2003, the company initiated the exchange offer pursuant to a form s-4
that was filed with the securities and exchange commission. accordingly, each series of exchange notes has been registered under the securities act, and the transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the restricted notes do not apply
to the exchange notes. as of may 13, 2003 (the expiration date of the exchange offer), 99.8%, 99.4% and 100% of the companys 5, 10, and 30-year restricted notes, respectively, were exchanged for exchange notes.   4.50% convertible junior subordinated notesin march 2002, the
company issued $893 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% convertible junior subordinated notes, which will mature on april 15, 2032, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. interest is payable quarterly in arrears. the company has
the option to defer interest payments on the notes for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive interest periods nor beyond the maturity of the notes. during a deferral period, the amount of interest due to holders of the notes will continue to
accumulate, and such deferred interest payments will themselves accrue interest. deferral of any interest can create certain restrictions for the company. unless previously redeemed or repurchased, the notes are convertible into shares of common
stock at the option of the holders at any time after march 27, 2003 and prior to april 15, 2032 if at any time (1) the average of the daily closing prices of common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the conversion date
is at least 20% above the then applicable conversion price on the conversion date, (2) the notes have been called for redemption, (3) specified corporate transactions have occurred, or (4) specified credit rating events with respect to the notes
have occurred. the notes

redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes. the notes are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness. the notes are also effectively subordinated to all
existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any of the companys current or future subsidiaries.   6.00% convertible notesin august 2002, ciri, a subsidiary of the company, issued $50 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% convertible

agreements with citibank, a subsidiary of citigroup, tpcs former parent: (i) a $250 million 45-month revolving line of credit (the 45-month line of credit), and (ii) a $250 million 364-day revolving line of credit (the tpc 364-day line of
credit and, together with the 45-month line of credit, the tpc lines of credit). tpc may, with citibanks consent, extend the commitment of the 364-day line of credit for additional 364-day periods under the same terms and conditions. tpc has
the option, provided there is no default or event of default, to convert outstanding advances under the 364-day line of credit at the commitment termination date to a term loan maturing no later than one year from the commitment termination date.
prior to the merger, spc was party to the following line of
credit agreements with a syndicate of banks: (i) a $330 million 364-day revolving line of credit (the spc 364-day line of credit), and (ii) a $270 million 5-year revolving line of credit (the 5-year line of credit and, together with the spc 364-day
line of credit, the spc lines of credit). spc may, with bank syndicate consent, extend the commitment of the spc 364-day line of credit for additional 364-day periods under the same terms and conditions.   as a result of the expiration of the spc 364-day line of credit and the tpc
364-day line of credit, the company entered into a new $480 million 364-day revolving line of credit agreement (the sta 364-day line of credit) with a syndicate of banks. as of december 31, 2004, the company has access to the following bank credit
lines: (i) the $250 million 45-month line of credit, (ii) the $270 million 5-year line of credit, and (iii) the $480 million sta 364-day line of credit (collectively, the company line of credit). the company line of credit supports the

if the company
determines that any of its deferred tax assets will not result in future tax benefits, a valuation allowance must be established for the portion of these assets that are not expected to be realized. the net change in the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets was an increase of $128 million in 2004 relating to foreign operations. based predominantly upon a review of the companys anticipated future taxable income, but also including all other available evidence, both positive and
negative, the companys management concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized.   at december 31, 2002, the company had a net operating loss (nol) carryforward of $1.39 billion. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement with
citigroup, the company is entitled to carry operating losses back to prior years upon receiving citigroups consent. during the first quarter of 2003, the company received citigroups consent and, as a result, the companys deferred
tax asset was reduced by $487 million with a corresponding reduction to the current federal income tax payable (included in other cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows). on june 9, 2003, the company
received a federal income tax refund of $531 million, which included the utilization of the nol carryforward.   for the period ending march 27, 2002, the company was included in the consolidated federal income tax return filed by citigroup. citigroup allocated
federal income taxes to its subsidiaries on a separate return basis adjusted for credits and other amounts required by the consolidation process. any resulting liability was paid currently to citigroup. any credit for losses was paid by citigroup
currently to the extent that such credits were for tax benefits that have been utilized in the consolidated federal income tax return.   as of march 28, 2002, as a result of the ipo, the company is no longer included in the citigroup consolidated federal income tax return. as of that date,
the company began filing its own consolidated federal income tax return. the companys intercompany tax sharing agreement was amended to include the spc companies effective with their acquisition on april 1, 2004.

for tax return purposes, as of december 31, 2004, the company had nol carryforwards that expire, if
unused, in 2017-2021 and foreign tax credit (ftc) carryforwards that expire, if unused, in 2009-2013. the amount and timing of realizing the benefits of nol and ftc carryforwards depend on future taxable income and limitations imposed by tax laws.
the approximate amounts of those nols on a regular tax basis and an alternative minimum tax (amt) basis were $2.09 billion and $276 million, respectively. the approximate amounts of the ftcs both on a regular tax basis and an amt basis were $27
million. the benefits of the nol and ftc carryforwards have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.   u.s. income taxes have not been provided on $149 million of the companys foreign operations undistributed earnings as of december 31, 2004, as
such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations. furthermore, any taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits against the u.s. tax on any dividend distributions from such earnings.
taxes on the gaap basis in excess of tax basis of
approximately $1.96 billion related to the companys majority ownership of nuveen investments have not been recognized as of december 31, 2004. in january 2005, the company announced that it will explore strategic alternatives to divest its
majority ownership position in nuveen investments, which may result in a transaction that is tax-free, taxable, or some combination thereof.

shareholders equity and dividend availability   mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts   tighi, in 1996, formed statutory subsidiary business trusts under the laws of the state of delaware, which issued trust securities representing undivided
beneficial interests in the assets of the trust. the gross proceeds of the trust securities were invested in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (junior subordinated debentures) of its parent (tpc). on april 9, 2003, tighi redeemed
the $900 million aggregate principal of the tighi 8.00% to 8.08% junior subordinated debentures held by the subsidiary trusts. the subsidiary trusts, in turn, used these funds to redeem the $900 million liquidation value of the trust securities.
preferred stock   the companys preferred shareholders equity represents the par
value of preferred shares outstanding that the company assumed in the merger related to the st. paul companies, inc. stock ownership plan (sop) trust, less the remaining principal balance on the sop trust debt. the sop trust borrowed funds from a
u.s. underwriting subsidiary to finance the purchase of the preferred shares, and the company guaranteed the sop debt.   the sop trust may at any time convert any or all of the preferred shares into shares of the companys common stock at a rate of eight shares of
common stock for each preferred share. the board of directors has reserved a sufficient number of authorized common shares to satisfy the conversion of all preferred shares issued to the sop trust and the redemption of preferred shares to meet
employee distribution requirements. upon the redemption of preferred shares, the company will issue shares of common stock to the trust to fulfill the redemption obligations. see note 14.   holders of preferred stock have a preference upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company of $100 per share.
common stock   on april 1, 2004, each issued and outstanding share of tpc class a and class
b common stock (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights) was exchanged for 0.4334 of a share of the companys common stock. see note 2.

the company is governed by the minnesota business corporation act. all authorized shares of voting
common stock have no par value. shares of common stock reacquired are considered treasury shares. the number of authorized shares of the company is 1.75 billion.   the articles of incorporation allow the company to issue five million undesignated shares. the board of directors may
designate the type of shares and set the terms thereof. the board designated 1,450,000 shares as series b convertible preferred stock in connection with the formation of the stock ownership plan.   on january 25, 2005, the company, through its capital accumulation program
(cap) and on january 25, 2005 and february 4, 2005, through its equity awards program, issued 2,048,729 common stock awards in the form of restricted stock and deferred stock to participating officers and other key employees. the fair value per
share of the common stock was $36.97 and $38.16 on january 25, 2005 and february 4, 2005, respectively. these awards generally vest after a two-year period for the 2005 cap awards and three years for the 2005 awards issued under the equity awards
program. on january 22, 2004 and january 23, 2003, the company issued under the cap program 847,593 and 842,368 shares, respectively, of common stock in the form of restricted stock to participating officers and other key employees. the fair value
per share of the common stock was $41.35 and $37.33, respectively. the restricted stock awards in 2004 and 2003 generally vest after a three-year period.   on march 21, 2002, tpc sold approximately 231 million shares of its class a common stock in a public offering for net proceeds of $4.09 billion.
treasury stock   all shares of tpc common stock that were held by the company as treasury
stock at the merger date of april 1, 2004, were cancelled and retired as of that date.   the companys 2004 incentive plan, the spc 1994 stock incentives plan and the tpc 2002 incentive plan provide settlement alternatives to employees in which the company repurchases shares to cover tax withholding
costs and exercise costs. at december 31, 2004 and 2003, the company had purchased $14 million and $18 million, respectively, of its common stock under this plan.   prior to the merger, tpcs board of directors approved a $500 million share repurchase program. during 2003, tpc
repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares (as adjusted for the merger) of its common stock at a total cost of $40 million. that repurchase program was terminated upon completion of the merger.   the company entered into a commitment, in conjunction with the august 2002
citigroup distribution, to acquire the company common stock held by the citigroup capital accumulation program (citigroup cap) upon forfeiture of plan participants for which it prepaid $15 million. this commitment expires over three years upon
vesting of the citigroup cap participants. in march 2004, citigroup accelerated the vesting of their cap participant awards, and accordingly, the company has no further obligation to acquire the company stock held by citigroup cap. the company has
63,321 shares due from citigroup for unvested shares and a prepaid balance due from citigroup of $7 million. at december 31, 2003 and 2002, tpc had acquired $4 million and $1 million, respectively, of its common stock pursuant to this arrangement.

13. incentive plans
after the merger, the companys board of directors adopted the st. paul travelers companies, inc. 2004 stock incentive plan (the 2004 incentive
plan), which also was approved by the companys shareholders on july 28, 2004. the purposes of the 2004 incentive plan are to reward the efforts of the companys non-employee directors, executive officers and other employees and to attract
new personnel by providing incentives in the form of stock-based awards. the 2004 incentive plan permits grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock, stock units,
performance awards and other stock-based or stock-denominated awards with respect to the companys common stock. the maximum number of shares of the companys common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2004
incentive plan is 35 million shares, subject to additional shares that may be available for awards as described below.   in connection with the adoption of the 2004 incentive plan, the legacy travelers property casualty corp. 2002 stock incentive plan (legacy tpc 2002
incentive plan) and the legacy st. paul global stock option plan (legacy global stock option plan), which ceased granting awards after 2001, were terminated. the legacy st. paul amended and restated 1994 stock incentive plan (legacy
spc 1994 stock plan) had expired on may 4, 2004 by its own terms, and other legacy spc stock plans had either terminated or had no shares available for future grant. the legacy tpc 2002 incentive plan was the only plan pursuant to which tpc could
make stock-based awards prior to the merger. outstanding grants were not affected by the plans termination including the grant of reload options related to prior option grants under the legacy tpc 2002 incentive plan and the legacy spc 1994
stock plan.   the 2004 incentive plan is the only plan pursuant
to which future stock-based awards may be granted. in addition to the 35 million shares initially authorized for issuance under the 2004 incentive plan, the following will not be counted towards the 35 million shares available and will be available
for future grants under the 2004 incentive plan: (i) shares of common stock subject to an award that expires unexercised, that is forfeited, terminated or canceled, that is settled in cash or other forms of property, or otherwise does not result in
the issuance of shares of common stock, in whole or in part; (ii) shares that are used to pay the exercise price of stock options and shares used to pay withholding taxes on awards generally; and (iii) shares purchased by the company on the open
market using cash option exercise proceeds; provided, however, that the increase in the number of shares of common stock available for grant pursuant to such market purchases shall not be greater than the number that could be repurchased at fair
market value on the date of exercise of the stock option giving rise to such option proceeds.   except for shares delivered to or retained in the spc 1994 stock plan and the tpc 2002 incentive plan in connection with the payment of the exercise price of and, as to tpc option grants, the withholding of taxes
applicable to the exercise of, outstanding options under those plans that have reload features, the provisions of the preceding paragraph that result in shares becoming available for future grants under the 2004 incentive plan also apply to any
awards granted under the spc1994 stock plan and the tpc 2002 incentive plan that were outstanding on the effective date of the 2004 stock plan. in addition, the number of shares of common stock available for grant under the 2004 stock plan will not
be reduced by shares subject to awards granted under the 2004 incentive plan upon the assumption of or in substitution for awards in connection with business combinations (as defined in the 2004 incentive plan).   after the merger, the companys board of directors also adopted a
compensation program for non-employee directors (the 2004 director compensation program). under the 2004 director compensation program, non-employee directors compensation consists of an annual retainer, a deferred stock award and a stock
option award. each non-employee director may choose to receive all or a portion of his or her annual

retainer and any committee chair or co-chair fees paid in the form of cash, common stock or deferred stock. deferred stock for the annual retainer, and
committee chair and co-chair fees, is elected pursuant to the st. paul travelers deferred compensation plan for non-employee directors that the board adopted after the merger and is vested upon grant. the annual deferred stock awards vest one year
after the date of award. any of the deferred stock awards may accumulate until distribution at a future date or upon termination of a directors service. the shares of the companys common stock issued under the 2004 director compensation
program, including shares of deferred stock, are awarded under the 2004 incentive plan.   fixed stock option awards   2004 incentive
plan   the company established an equity awards program
under the 2004 incentive plan, pursuant to which the company may issue stock option awards to eligible officers and key employees. under the equity awards program, stock option awards are granted having a ten-year term with an exercise price equal
to the fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. generally, the stock options vest over a four year period, with 50% of the option shares vesting on the 2nd anniversary of the date of grant, and 25% of the option shares vesting on each of the 3rd and 4th anniversaries of
the grant date. except as the compensation committee of the board may allow in the future, stock options cannot be sold or transferred by the participant.   legacy tpc 2002 incentive plan   on april 1, 2004, in accordance with the merger agreement, the outstanding stock options to purchase shares of tpc common stock were converted into
options to purchase the companys common stock. these stock options retained substantially the same terms and conditions that were applicable prior to the conversion. the 0.4334 merger exchange ratio was applied to the outstanding tpc stock
options to reflect this conversion.   the tpc stock options
awards granted under the legacy tpc 2002 incentive plan have a ten-year term with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant (as adjusted to reflect the merger). stock options granted under this
plan prior to april 27, 2004, generally vest 20% each year over a five-year period. stock options granted under this plan from april 27, 2004 until the plan termination on july 28, 2004, generally vest over a four year period, with 50% of the option
shares vesting on the 2nd anniversary of the date of grant, and 25% of the option shares vesting on each of the
3rd and 4th anniversaries of the grant date. prior to january 23, 2003, certain stock option awards granted under the tpc 2002 incentive plan permitted an employee exercising an option to be granted a new option
(a reload option) in an amount equal to the number of shares of the tpc common stock used to satisfy both the exercise price and withholding taxes due upon exercise of an option. prior to the merger, the reload options were granted at an exercise
price equal to the fair market value of tpcs common stock on the date of grant, and after the merger the reload options will be granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of
grant. the reload options vest six months after the grant date and are exercisable for the remaining term of the related original option.   also under the tpc 2002 incentive plan, tpc had established a wealthbuilder stock option program which provided for the granting of stock options to all
employees meeting certain requirements, having the same terms as the management grants described above except that the awards granted under this program did not contain stock option reload features. tpc ceased issuing stock-option awards under the
wealthbuilder stock option program after june 2002.

incentive plans, continued
legacy spc 1994 stock plan and global stock option plan   on april 1, 2004, in connection with the merger, the company assumed 23
million outstanding spc stock options, of which approximately 4 million remained unvested related to legacy spc equity-based compensation plans. these stock options retained the same terms and conditions that were applicable prior to the merger.
under the spc stock option programs, stock option awards were granted having a ten year term with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. generally, options vest 25% each year over a
four-year period. certain stock option awards granted under the spc 1994 stock plan between february 2002 and february 3, 2003 permitted an employee exercising an option to be granted a new option (a reload option) in an amount equal to the number
of shares of the company common stock used to satisfy the exercise price due upon exercise of an option. the reload options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the company common stock on the date of grant, vest one
year after the grant date and are exercisable for the remaining term of the related original option.   legacy citigroup incentive plans   prior to the ipo in march 2002, tpc participated in various stock option plans sponsored by its former affiliate, citigroup, that provided for the
granting of stock options in citigroup common stock to officers and key employees, and, in the case of certain stock option programs, to all employees meeting specific requirements.   on august 20, 2002, in connection with the citigroup distribution, citigroup stock option awards held by tpc employees on
that date under various legacy citigroup incentive plans were cancelled and replaced with stock option awards (replacement awards) to purchase tpcs common stock under the tpc 2002 incentive plan. these replacement awards were granted on
substantially the same terms, including vesting, as the former citigroup awards. reflecting adjustment for the merger, the total number of the companys common stock subject to the replacement awards was 25 million shares of which 11 million
shares were vested and therefore exercisable. the number of shares of tpcs common stock to which the replacement awards related and the per share exercise price of the replacement awards were determined so that:
the intrinsic value of each citigroup option, which was the difference between the closing price of citigroups common stock on august 20, 2002, and the exercise price of the
citigroup options, was preserved in each replacement award for tpcs common stock; and
the ratio of the exercise price of the replacement award to the closing price of the companys common stock on august 20, 2002, immediately after the citigroup distribution,
was the same as the ratio of the exercise price of the citigroup option to the price of citigroup common stock immediately before the citigroup distribution.

all original and reload stock options granted under the companys stock option programs had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. the stock option awards of spc assumed in the merger on april 1, 2004, the awards of ciri converted on august 4, 2004, and the replacement awards
granted on august 20, 2002 retained the intrinsic value of the awards immediately prior to being assumed, converted or replaced and therefore the exercise price either exceeded the market value or was less than the market value on those respective

stock option fair value information
the fair value effect of stock options is derived by
application of a variation of the black-scholes option pricing model.   the significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value on the date of the grant for original options and reload options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 and for the awards assumed on april 1, 2004 from spc at the merger and replacement
awards issued august 20, 2002 to tpc employees who held citigroup stock option awards on that date were as follows:

incentive plans, continued
in connection with spc options assumed in the merger, the estimated fair value of all the outstanding
spc stock options at april 1, 2004 was $186 million and was included in the determination of the purchase price based upon the announcement date market price per share of spc common stock, using an option-pricing model. the unvested stock option
awards require the holder to render service during the vesting period and are therefore considered unearned compensation. at april 1, 2004, the estimated fair values of the unvested awards were $35 million and have been included in unearned
compensation as a separate component of equity. the unearned compensation expense is being recognized as a charge to income over the remaining vesting period.
in connection with the citigroup distribution, the exchange of options in conjunction with a spinoff is considered a modification and therefore the
modification guidance of fas 123 was applied to the replacement awards issued on august 20, 2002. for vested replacement options, any excess of the fair value of the modified options issued over the fair value of the original options at the date of
exchange was recognized as additional compensation cost. for nonvested replacement options, any excess of the fair value of the modified options issued over the fair value of the original options at the date of exchange is added to the remaining
unrecognized compensation cost of the original option and recognized over the remaining vesting period.   also, ciri had equity-based compensation plans in which awards were granted in ciris privately held common stock. in connection with
indemnitys purchase of the minority interest of ciri (see note 2) the company converted ciris outstanding equity based-awards into awards in the companys common stock. the converted awards retained the same terms and conditions
that were applicable prior to the conversion. the conversion of ciri outstanding nonvested options into options to purchase the companys common stock is considered a modification and therefore the modification guidance of fas 123 was applied
to the converted awards. for these converted options, the excess of the fair value of the modified options issued over the fair value of the original options at the date of exchange is added to the remaining unrecognized compensation cost of the
original option and recognized over the remaining vesting period.   under fas 123, reload options are treated as separate grants from the original grants and as a result are separately valued when granted. reload options are exercisable for the remaining term of the related original option and therefore
would generally have a shorter estimated life. shares received through option exercises under the reload program are subject to restriction on sale. discounts (as measured by the estimated cost of protection) have been applied to the fair value of
reload options granted to reflect these sales restrictions.   restricted
stock and deferred stock programs   2004 incentive plan
the company may issue awards of restricted stock and
deferred stock to eligible officers and key employees pursuant to the 2004 incentive plan. such awards include restricted stock grants under the capital accumulation program (cap) and equity awards program established pursuant to the 2004 incentive
plan. awards issued under the cap program are in the form of restricted stock and the number of shares included in the restricted stock award is calculated at a 10% discount from the market price on the date of the award and generally vest in full
after a two-year period from the date of grant. other restricted stock awards issued under the equity awards program generally vest in full after a three-year period from the date of grant. except under limited circumstances, during this period the
stock cannot be sold or transferred by the participant, who is required to render service to the company during the restricted period. awards granted to non-u.s. participants are in the form of deferred stock awards. these deferred stock awards are
granted at market price and generally vest after three years from the date of grant and are subject to the same conditions as the restricted stock awards except that the shares are not issued until the vesting criteria are satisfied.

incentive plans, continued
legacy tpc 2002 incentive plans   on april 1, 2004, in accordance with the merger agreement, the restricted stock awards and deferred stock awards of the
legacy tpc 2002 incentive plan were converted to restricted stock awards and deferred stock awards in the companys common stock. these restricted stock awards and deferred stock awards retained substantially the same terms and conditions that
were applicable prior to the conversion. the 0.4334 merger exchange ratio was applied to the outstanding tpc restricted stock awards and deferred stock awards to reflect this conversion.   the tpc restricted stock awards granted under the legacy tpc 2002 incentive plan were awarded to eligible officers and key
employees through tpcs capital accumulation program (tpc cap). under this plan, certain tpc cap participants received part of their annual bonus awards in restricted stock, and at their election, part in stock options. the number of shares
included in the restricted stock award was calculated at a 25% discount from the market price on the date of the award and generally vested in full after a three-year period. except under limited circumstances, during this period the stock cannot be
sold or transferred by the participant, who is required to render service to the company during the restricted period. awards granted to non-u.s. participants were in the form of deferred stock awards. these deferred stock awards are subject to the
same conditions as the restricted stock awards except that the shares are not issued until the vesting criteria are satisfied.   legacy spc 1994 stock plan   on april 1, 2004, in connection with the merger, the company assumed approximately 240,000 of outstanding spc restricted stock awards related to spc
equity-based compensation plans. these restricted stock awards retained the same terms and conditions that were applicable prior to the merger. under the spc 1994 stock plan, the awards of restricted stock were subject to completing a specified
objective or period of employment, generally one to five years. under the spc capital accumulation plan, implemented in 2002, the number of shares included in the restricted stock award is calculated at a 10% discount from the market price at the
date of the award and generally vests in full after a two-year period. the unvested restricted stock awards require the holder to render service during the vesting period and are therefore considered unearned compensation. at april 1, 2004, the
estimated fair value of the unvested restricted stock awards subject to amortization was $9 million and has been included in unearned compensation as a separate component of equity. the unearned compensation expense is being recognized as a charge
to income over the remaining vesting period.   legacy
citigroup incentive plan   prior to the ipo, tpc
participated in citigroups capital accumulation plan (citigroup cap) that provided for the issuance of shares of citigroup common stock in the form of restricted stock awards to eligible officers and other key employees with substantially the
same terms as the tpcs 2002 cap.   on august 20, 2002, in
connection with the citigroup distribution, the unvested outstanding awards of restricted stock and deferred shares held by tpc employees on that date under citigroup cap, were cancelled and replaced by awards comprised primarily of 1.3 million
newly issued shares of tpcs common stock (which reflects adjustment for the merger) at a total market value of $53 million based on the closing price of the tpcs common stock on august 20, 2002. these replacement awards were granted on
substantially the same terms, including vesting, as the former citigroup awards. the value of these newly issued shares along with the

in addition, the st.
paul travelers deferred compensation plan for non-employee directors and legacy spc and tpc directors plans allow deferred receipt of shares of common stock (deferred stock) to a future distribution date or upon termination of a
directors service. the after-tax compensation cost associated with this plan was not significant in 2004, 2003 and 2002.   unearned compensation expense is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period. the after-tax compensation cost charged to earnings for
these restricted stock and deferred stock awards was $26 million, $17 million and $17 million for the years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.   other incentive plans   in addition to the companys equity-based compensation plans discussed above, nuveen investments has an equity-based compensation plan in which
awards are granted in nuveen investments publicly traded common stock. the after-tax compensation cost associated with these awards included in the companys earnings was approximately $9 million.

pension plans, retirement benefits and savings plans   prior to december 31, 2004, both tpc and spc sponsored qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plans. on december 31, 2004, the qualified
noncontributory defined benefit pension plans of tpc and spc were merged to form one plan. the company sponsors the merged plan, which covers substantially all employees and provides benefits under a cash balance formula, except that employees
satisfying certain age and service requirements remain covered by a prior final pay formulas. in addition, the company and tpc sponsor nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which cover certain highly-compensated employees and also sponsor
postretirement health and life insurance benefit plans for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for certain retirees. prior to the august 20, 2002 citigroup distribution, substantially similar benefits were provided to tpc
employees through plans sponsored by citigroup.

in choosing the
expected long-term rate of return, the companys pension plan investment committee considered the historical returns of equity and fixed income markets in conjunction with todays economic and financial market conditions.   as an indicator of sensitivity, increasing the assumed health care cost trend
rate by 1% would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $39 million at december 31, 2004, and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense by $4 million for the year
ended december 31, 2004. decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 31, 2004 by $32 million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost
components of net postretirement benefit expense by $3 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the sensitivity of the foregoing hypothetical changes in the assumed health care cost trend rates to the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at december 31, 2003, and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense for the year ended december 31, 2003 was negligible.   on december 8, 2003, the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 (2003 medicare act) was
enacted. the 2003 medicare act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part
d. the company has concluded that prescription drug benefits available under the spc postretirement benefit plan are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and thus qualify for the federal subsidy under the 2003 medicare act. the company also
expects that the federal subsidy will offset or reduce the companys share of the cost of the underlying postretirement prescription drug coverage on which the subsidy is based. as a result, the estimated effect of the 2003 medicare act was
reflected in the purchase accounting remeasurement of the spc postretirement benefit plan on april 1, 2004. the effect of this adjustment was a $29 million reduction (with no tax effect) in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of

the company has a 401(k) savings plan under which substantially all
legacy tpc employees and company employees hired after april 1, 2004, are eligible to participate. in 2004, the company matched employee contributions up to 5% of eligible pay but not more than $2,500 annually. prior to 2004, the company matched
employee contributions up to 3% of eligible pay but not more than $1,500 annually. the expense related to this plan was $34 million, $20 million and $17 million for the years ended december 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.   savings plus and stock ownership plans   in connection with the merger, the company assumed the st. paul companies,
inc. savings plus plan (spp), a 401(k) savings plan and the st. paul companies, inc. stock ownership plan (sop). substantially all employees who were hired by legacy spc before april 1, 2004 are eligible to participate in these plans. in 2004 under
the spp, the company matched 100% of employees contributions up to a maximum of 6% of their salary. the match was in the form of preferred shares, to the extent available in the sop, or in the companys common shares. also allocated to
participants were preferred shares equal to the value of dividends on previously allocated shares.

to finance the preferred stock purchase for future allocation to qualified employees, the sop
borrowed $150 million at 9.4% from a primary u.s. underwriting subsidiary. as the principal and interest of the trusts loan is paid, a pro rata amount of preferred stock is released for allocation to participating employees. each share of
preferred stock pays a dividend of $11.72 annually and is currently convertible into eight shares of our common stock. preferred stock dividends on all shares held by the trust are used to pay a portion of the sop obligation. in addition to
dividends paid to the trust, additional cash contributions are made to the sop as necessary in order to meet the sops debt obligation.   all common shares and the common stock equivalent of all preferred shares held by the sop are considered outstanding for diluted eps computations and
dividends paid on all shares are charged to retained earnings.   the company follows the provisions of statement of position 76-3, accounting practices for certain employee stock ownership plans, and related interpretations in accounting for this plan. the company recorded an expense of $5
million in 2004.    the following table details the

are $171 million, $149 million, $127 million, $100 million, $68 million and $124 million for 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and thereafter, respectively. future sublease rental income of approximately $69 million will partially offset these

detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge, which includes the item and risk that is being hedged, the derivative that is being used, as well as how effectiveness is being assessed. a derivative has to be highly
effective in accomplishing the objective of offsetting either changes in fair value or cash flows for the risk being hedged.   for fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in net realized investment gains (losses), together with changes in the fair
value of the related hedged item. at december 31, 2004, the amount that the company expects to include in earnings over the next twelve months for fair value hedges is not significant. the company did not utilize fair value hedges during the year
ended december 31, 2003. the companys fair value hedges result from nuveen investments utilization of interest rate swaps entered into to hedge a portion of the fair value of its private placement debt. the swaps were terminated in 2004.
for cash flow hedges, the accounting treatment depends on the
effectiveness of the hedge. to the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the derivatives fair value will not be included in current earnings but are reported in accumulated
other changes in equity from nonowner sources. these changes in fair value will be included in the earnings of future periods when earnings are also affected by the variability of the hedged cash flows. at december 31, 2004, the amount that the
company expects to include in net realized investment gains (losses) over the next twelve months for these cash flow hedges is not significant. to the extent these derivatives are not effective, changes in their fair value are immediately included
in net realized investment gains (losses). the companys cash flow hedges primarily include hedges of floating rate available-for-sale securities and certain forecasted transactions up to a maximum tenure of one year.   for net investment hedges in which derivatives hedge the foreign currency
exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, the accounting treatment will similarly depend on the effectiveness of the hedge. the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative hedging the net investment, including any
forward premium or discount, is reflected in the accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. for the years ended december 31, 2004 and 2003, the amount included in the foreign
currency translation adjustment in equity from nonowner sources was a $4 million loss and a $17 million loss, respectively. the ineffective portion is reflected in net realized investment gains (losses).   the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated on a
retrospective and prospective basis using quantitative measures of correlation. if a hedge relationship is found to be ineffective, it no longer qualifies as a hedge, and any excess gains or losses attributable to such ineffectiveness as well as
subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in net realized investment gains (losses). during the years ended december 31, 2004 and 2003, the company had no realized gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness.   derivatives that are not designated or do not qualify as hedges are also
carried at fair value with changes in value reflected in net realized investment gains (losses). the company has certain u.s. treasury futures contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, which are not designated as hedges at december 31, 2004
and 2003.   for those hedge relationships that are terminated,
hedge designations removed, or forecasted transactions that are no longer expected to occur, the hedge accounting treatment described in the paragraphs above will no longer apply. for fair value hedges, any changes to the hedged item remain as part
of the basis of the asset and

are ultimately reflected as an element of the yield. for cash flow hedges, any changes in fair value of the end-user derivative remain in accumulated other
changes in equity from nonowner sources, and are included in earnings of future periods when earnings are also affected by the variability of the hedged cash flow. if the hedged relationship was discontinued because a forecasted transaction will not
occur when scheduled, any changes in fair value of the end-user derivative are immediately reflected in net realized investment gains (losses). during the years ended december 31, 2004 and 2003, the company had no discontinued forecasted
transactions.   the company also purchases investments that have
embedded derivatives, primarily convertible debt securities. these embedded derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in value reflected in net realized investment gains (losses). the company bifurcates an embedded derivative where a) the
economic characteristics and risks of the embedded instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, b) the entire instrument would not otherwise be remeasured at fair value, and c) a
separate instrument with the same terms of the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative under fas 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities (fas 133). derivatives embedded in convertible debt
securities are reported on a combined basis with their host instrument and are classified as fixed maturity securities.   the company engaged in u.s. treasury note futures transactions to modify the duration of the investment portfolio. the company enters into 90 day futures
contracts on 2 year, 5 year, 10 year and 30 year u.s. treasury notes which require a daily mark to market settlement with the broker. the notional value of the open u.s. treasury futures contracts was $1.33 billion and $1.48 billion at december 31,
2004 and december 31, 2003, respectively. these derivative instruments are not designated and do not qualify as hedges under fas 133 and as such the daily mark to market settlement is reflected in net realized investment gains (losses). net realized
investment gains (losses) in 2004 and 2003 included losses of $44 million and $27 million, respectively, related to u.s. treasury futures contracts which are settled daily.   as a result of the merger, the company acquired 6 million stock purchase warrants of platinum underwriters, a publicly held
company. these warrants are not designated and do not qualify as hedges under fas 133 and as such the mark to market is reflected in net realized gains (losses).   nuveen investments entered into swap agreements that have not been designated as hedging instruments. the swap agreements
are used to support new products offered by nuveen investments. the mark-to-market valuations were not significant and are reflected in results of operations.
during the third quarter of 2004, the company terminated its interest rate swap agreements which had been acquired in the merger. the notional value of
these swaps was $730 million at the time of the termination. these interest rate swap agreements were used to manage exposure of certain of its fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates. these derivative instruments did not qualify for continued
hedge accounting following the merger and, as such, the mark-to-market changes in fair value were reflected in net realized investment gains and losses prior to the termination of these agreements.   fair value of financial instruments   the company uses various financial instruments in the normal course of its
business. certain insurance contracts are excluded by fas 107, disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, and, therefore, are not included in the amounts discussed.

at december 31, 2004 and 2003, investments in fixed maturities had a fair value, which equaled
carrying value, of $54.26 billion and $33.05 billion, respectively. the fair value of investments in fixed maturities for which a quoted market price or dealer quote are not available was $574 million and $685 million at december31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. see note 1.   the carrying values of cash,
short-term securities, mortgage loans, investment income accrued, and payables for securities lending and repurchase agreements approximated their fair values. see notes 1 and 6.   the carrying values of $1.23 billion and $284 million of financial instruments classified as other assets approximated their
fair values at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. the carrying values of $4.94 billion and $2.69 billion of financial instruments classified as other liabilities at december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, also approximated their fair
values. fair value is determined using various methods including discounted cash flows, as appropriate for the various financial instruments.   the carrying value and fair value of the companys debt at december 31, 2004 was $6.62 billion and $6.78 billion, respectively. the respective totals
at december 31, 2003 were $2.68 billion and $2.77 billion.   the
fair value of commercial paper included in debt outstanding at december 31, 2004 approximated its book value of $499 million because of its short-term nature. for other debt, the fair value estimate was based upon the bid price at december 31, 2004
and 2003.

contingencies, commitments and guarantees   contingencies   the following section describes the major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the
company or its subsidiaries are a party or to which any of the companys property is subject.   asbestos and environmental-related proceedings   in the ordinary course of its insurance business, the company receives claims for insurance arising under policies issued by the company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos and other hazardous waste
and toxic substances which are the subject of related coverage litigation, including, among others, the litigation described below. the company continues to be subject to aggressive asbestos-related litigation. the conditions surrounding the final
resolution of these claims and the related litigation continue to change.   tpc is involved in three significant proceedings relating to acands, inc. (acands), formerly a national distributor and installer of products containing asbestos, including acands bankruptcy proceedings. the
proceedings involve disputes as to whether and to what extent any of acands potential liabilities for bodily injury asbestos claims are covered by insurance policies issued by tpc. these proceedings have resulted in decisions favorable to tpc,
although those decisions are subject to appellate review. the status of the various proceedings is described below.   acands filed for bankruptcy in september 2002 (in re: acands, inc., pending in the u.s. bankruptcy court for the district of delaware). in its
proposed plan of reorganization, acands sought to establish a trust to pay asbestos bodily injury claims against it and sought to assign to the trust its rights under the insurance policies

issued by tpc. the proposed plan and disclosure statement filed by acands claimed that acands had settled the vast majority of asbestos-related bodily injury
claims currently pending against it for approximately $2.80 billion. acands asserts that, based on a prior agreement between tpc and acands and acands interpretation of the july 31, 2003 arbitration panel ruling described below, tpc is liable
for 45% of the $2.80 billion. on january 26, 2004, the bankruptcy court issued a decision rejecting confirmation of acands proposed plan of reorganization. the bankruptcy court found, consistent with tpcs objections to acands
proposed plan, that the proposed plan was not fundamentally fair, was not proposed in good faith and did not comply with section 524(g) of the bankruptcy code. acands has filed a notice of appeal of the bankruptcy courts decision and has filed
objections to the bankruptcy courts findings of fact and conclusions of law in the united states district court. tpc has moved to dismiss the appeal and objections and has also filed an opposition to acands objections.   an arbitration was commenced in january 2001 to determine whether and to what
extent acands financial obligations for bodily injury asbestos claims are subject to insurance policy aggregate limits. on july 31, 2003, the arbitration panel ruled in favor of tpc that asbestos bodily injury claims against acands are subject
to the aggregate limits of the policies issued to acands, which have been exhausted. in october 2003, acands commenced a lawsuit seeking to vacate the arbitration award as beyond the panels scope of authority (acands, inc. v. travelers
casualty and surety co., u.s.d.ct., e.d. pa.). on september 16, 2004, the court entered an order denying acands motion to vacate the arbitration award. on october 6, 2004, acands filed a notice of appeal. briefing of the appeal is
complete. oral argument has not been scheduled.   in the other
proceeding, a related case pending before the same court and commenced in september 2000 (acands v. travelers casualty and surety co., u.s.d. ct., e.d. pa.), acands sought a declaration of the extent to which the asbestos bodily injury claims
against acands are subject to occurrence limits under insurance policies issued by tpc. tpc filed a motion to dismiss this action based upon the july 31, 2003 arbitration decision described above. the court found the dispute was moot as a result of
the arbitration panels decision. the court, therefore, based on the arbitration panels decision, dismissed the case. on october 6, 2004, acands filed a notice of appeal. this appeal has been consolidated with the appeal referenced in the
paragraph above. briefing of the appeal is complete. oral argument has not been scheduled.   while the company cannot predict the outcome of the appeals of the various acands rulings or other legal actions, based on these rulings, the company would not have any significant obligations remaining under any
policies issued by tpc to acands.   in october 2001 and april
2002, two purported class action suits (wise v. travelers and meninger v. travelers), were filed against tpc and other insurers (not including spc) in state court in west virginia. these cases were subsequently consolidated into a
single proceeding in circuit court of kanawha county, west virginia. plaintiffs allege that the insurer defendants engaged in unfair trade practices by inappropriately handling and settling asbestos claims. the plaintiffs seek to reopen large
numbers of settled asbestos claims and to impose liability for damages, including punitive damages, directly on insurers. lawsuits similar to wise were filed in massachusetts and hawaii (these suits are collectively referred to as the
statutory and hawaii actions). also, in november 2001, plaintiffs in consolidated asbestos actions pending before a mass tort panel of judges in west virginia state court moved to amend their complaint to name tpc as a defendant,
alleging that tpc and other insurers breached alleged duties to certain users of asbestos products. in march 2002, the court granted the motion to amend. plaintiffs seek damages, including punitive damages. lawsuits seeking similar relief and
raising allegations similar to those presented in the west virginia amended complaint are also pending in ohio and texas state courts against tpc and spc and in louisiana state court against tpc (the claims asserted in these suits, together with the
west virginia suit, are collectively referred to as the common law claims).

all of the actions against tpc described in the preceding paragraph, other than the hawaii actions,
had been subject to a temporary restraining order entered by the federal bankruptcy court in new york that had previously presided over and approved the reorganization in bankruptcy of tpcs former policyholder johns-manville. in august 2002,
the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on tpcs motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting further prosecution of the lawsuits pursuant to the reorganization plan and related orders. at the conclusion of this hearing, the court ordered
the parties to mediation, appointed a mediator and continued the temporary restraining order. during 2003, the same bankruptcy court extended the existing injunction to apply to an additional set of cases filed in various state courts in texas and
ohio as well as to the attorneys who are prosecuting these cases. the order also enjoined these attorneys and their respective law firms from commencing any further lawsuits against tpc based upon these allegations without the prior approval of the
court. notwithstanding the injunction, additional common law claims were filed and served on tpc.   on november 19, 2003, the parties advised the bankruptcy court that a settlement of the statutory and hawaii actions had been reached. this settlement
includes a lump sum payment of up to $412 million by tpc, subject to a number of significant contingencies. after continued meetings with the mediator, the parties advised the bankruptcy court on may 25, 2004 that a settlement resolving
substantially all pending and similar future common law claims against tpc had also been reached. this settlement requires a payment of up to $90 million by tpc, subject to a number of significant contingencies. each of these settlements is
contingent upon, among other things, an order of the bankruptcy court clarifying that all of these claims, and similar future asbestos-related claims against tpc, are barred by prior orders entered by the bankruptcy court in connection with the
original johns-manville bankruptcy proceedings.   on august 17,
2004, the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the settlements and clarifying its prior orders that all of the pending statutory and hawaii actions and substantially all common law claims pending against tpc are barred. the order also applies
to similar direct action claims that may be filed in the future.   five appeals were taken from the august 17, 2004 ruling. these appeals have been consolidated and are currently pending. the parties have completed briefing all of the issues and await a date for oral argument. the company has no obligation
to pay any of the settlement amounts unless and until the orders and relief become final and are not subject to any further appellate review. it is not possible to predict how appellate courts will rule on the pending appeals.   spc, which is not covered by the bankruptcy court rulings or the settlements
described above, has numerous defenses in all of the direct action cases asserting common law claims that are pending against it. many of these defenses have been raised in initial motions to dismiss filed by spc and other insurers. there have been
favorable rulings during 2003 and 2004 in texas and during 2004 in ohio on some of these motions filed by spc and other insurers that dealt with statute of limitations and the validity of the alleged causes of actions. the plaintiffs in these
actions have appealed these favorable rulings. spcs defenses include the fact that these novel theories have no basis in law; that they are directly at odds with the well established law pertaining to the insured/insurer relationship; that
there is no generalized duty to warn as alleged by the plaintiffs; and that the applicable statute of limitations as to many of these claims has long since expired.   the company is defending its asbestos and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious
defenses; however, the outcome of these disputes is uncertain. in this regard, the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under
appropriate circumstances. for a discussion of other information regarding the companys asbestos and environmental exposure, see managements discussion and analysis of

financial condition and results of operationsasbestos claims and litigation, environmental claims and litigation and
uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves.   currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and their impact on the future development of claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. any such development will be affected by
future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, the companys
estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be
material to the companys results of operations and financial condition in future periods.   shareholder litigation and related proceedings   tpc and its board of directors were named as defendants in three putative class action lawsuits brought by shareholders alleging breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the merger of tpc and spc and seeking
injunctive relief as well as unspecified monetary damages. the actions were captioned henzel, et al. v. travelers property casualty corp., et al. (jud. dist. of waterbury, ct. nov. 17, 2003); vozzolo v. travelers property casualty corp.,
et al. (jud. dist. of waterbury, ct. nov. 17, 2003); and farina v. travelers property casualty corp., et al. (jud. dist. of waterbury, ct. december 15, 2003). the farina complaint also named spc and its former subsidiary, adams
acquisition corp., as defendants, alleging that they aided and abetted the alleged breach of fiduciary duty. on march 18, 2004, tpc and spc announced that all of these lawsuits had been settled, subject to court approval of the settlements. the
settlement included a modification to the termination fee that could have been paid had the merger not been completed, additional disclosure in the proxy statement distributed in connection with the merger and a nominal amount for attorneys
fees. before court approval of the settlement, additional shareholder litigation was commenced, as described below. in light of that litigation, the parties are evaluating how to proceed.   beginning in august 2004, following post-merger announcements by the company, various shareholders of the company commenced
fourteen putative class action lawsuits against the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the united states district court for the district of minnesota. plaintiff shareholders allege that certain disclosures
relating to the april 2004 merger between tpc and spc contained false or misleading statements with respect to the value of spcs loss reserves in violation of federal securities laws. the complaints do not specify damages. these actions have
been consolidated under the caption in re st. paul travelers securities litigation. plaintiffs have not yet filed a consolidated class action complaint. an additional putative class action based on the same allegations was brought in
new york state supreme court. this action was subsequently transferred to, and is currently pending in, the district of minnesota.   in addition, five other actions against the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors are pending in the united states district
court for the district of minnesota. two of these actions, kahnv. the st. paul travelers companies, inc., et al. (nov. 2, 2004) and michael a. bernstein profit sharing plan v. the st. paul travelers companies, inc., et al. (nov.
10, 2004), are putative class actions brought by certain shareholders of the company against the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors. in these two actions, plaintiff shareholders allege violations of federal
securities laws in connection with the companys alleged failure to make disclosure relating to the practice of paying brokers commissions on a contingent basis. two derivative actions have been brought against all current directors of the
company, naming the company as a nominal defendant. in rowe v. fishman, et al. (oct.22, 2004), the plaintiff shareholder alleges state law claims, including breach of fiduciary duty, based on allegations similar to those alleged in
in re st. paul travelers securities litigation described above. in clark v. fishman, et al. (nov. 18,

2004), the plaintiff shareholder alleges state law claims, including breach of fiduciary duty, based on the companys alleged mismanagement of and
failure to make disclosure relating to the practice of paying brokers commissions on a contingent basis. the derivative actions have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings as rowe, et al. v. fishman, et al. in the fifth of these actions,
an alleged beneficiary of the companys 401(k) savings plan has commenced a putative class action in the district of minnesota against the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors captioned spiziri v. the st. paul
travelers companies, inc., et al. (dec. 28, 2004). the plaintiff alleges violations of the employee retirement income security act based on allegations similar to those alleged in in re st.paul travelers securities litigation.
the company believes that these lawsuits have no merit and intends to
defend vigorously; however, the company is not able to provide any assurance that one or more of these proceedings will not be material to the companys results of operations in a future period. the company is obligated to indemnify its
officers and directors to the extent provided under minnesota law. as part of that obligation, the company will advance officers and directors attorneys fees and other expenses they incur in defending these lawsuits.   other proceedings   in previous filings, the company reported on a series of purported class actions and one multi-party action brought in
various courts around the united states against certain of tpcs subsidiaries, dozens of other insurers and the national council on compensation insurance. the allegations in the actions were substantially similar, and generally alleged that
the defendants conspired to collect excessive or improper premiums on loss-sensitive workers compensation insurance policies in violation of state insurance laws, antitrust laws, and state unfair trade practices laws. the plaintiffs in the
actions do not specify damages. tpc has vigorously defended the actions, with all but a few of the actions having been dismissed to date. in addition, the plaintiffs attempts to obtain class certification have not been successful. under the
present circumstances, the company does not believe its remaining exposure to be significant.   from time to time the company is involved in proceedings addressing disputes with its reinsurers regarding the collection of amounts due under the companys reinsurance agreements. these proceedings may be
initiated by the company or the reinsurers and may involve the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the coverage of particular claims, exclusions under the agreements, as well as counterclaims for rescission of the agreements. one of these disputes
is the action described in the following paragraph.   gulf, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of tpc, brought an action on may 22, 2003, as amended on may 12, 2004, in the supreme court of new york, county of new york (gulf insurance company v. transatlantic reinsurance company, et al.), against transatlantic
reinsurance company (transatlantic), xl reinsurance america, inc. (xl), odyssey america reinsurance corporation (odyssey), employers reinsurance company (employers) and gerling global reinsurance corporation of america (gerling), to recover amounts
due under reinsurance contracts issued to gulf and related to gulfs february 2003 settlement of a coverage dispute under a vehicle residual value protection insurance policy. the reinsurers have asserted counterclaims seeking rescission of the
vehicle residual value reinsurance contracts issued to gulf and unspecified damages for breach of contract. separate actions filed by transatlantic and gerling have been consolidated with the original gulf action for pre-trial purposes. on october
1, 2003, gulf entered into a final settlement agreement with employers, and all claims and counterclaims with respect to employers have been dismissed.   on may 26, 2004, the court denied gulfs motion to dismiss certain claims asserted by transatlantic and a joint motion by transatlantic, xl and
odyssey for summary judgment against gulf. discovery is currently proceeding in the matters. gulf denies the reinsurers allegations, believes that it has a strong legal basis to collect the amounts due under the reinsurance contracts and
intends to vigorously pursue the actions.

based on the companys beliefs about its legal positions in its various reinsurance recovery

government agencies. the areas of inquiry addressed to the company include its relationship with brokers and agents, the companys involvement with non-traditional insurance and reinsurance products, lawyer liability insurance and

with these subpoenas and requests for information. in addition, the company is currently undertaking its own review of the matters addressed by these subpoenas and requests for information. the company is not able to predict the outcome of the
various agencies investigations or the reviews being undertaken, or how these matters may affect the company, if at all.   four putative class action lawsuits have been brought against a number of insurance brokers and insurers, including the company, by plaintiffs who
allegedly purchased insurance products through one or more of the defendant brokers. the complaints are captioned shell vacations llc v. marsh & mclennan companies, inc. (n.d. ill. jan. 14, 2005), redwood oil company v. marsh &
mclennan companies, inc. (n.d. ill. jan. 21, 2005); boros v. marsh & mclennan companies, inc. (n.d. cal. feb. 4, 2005) and mulcahey v. arthur j. gallagher & co. (d.n.j. february 23, 2005). plaintiffs allege that various
insurance brokers conspired with each other and with various insurers, including the company, to allocate brokerage customers and rig bids for insurance products offered to those customers. the complaints include causes of action under the sherman
act, the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act, federal and state common law and the laws of the various states prohibiting antitrust violations and unfair and/or deceptive trade practices. plaintiffs seek monetary damages, including
punitive damages and trebled damages, permanent injunctive relief, restitution, including disgorgement of profits, interest and costs, including attorneys fees. the company believes that these lawsuits have no merit and intends to defend
vigorously.   in addition to those described above, the company
is involved in numerous lawsuits, not involving asbestos and environmental claims, arising mostly in the ordinary course of business operations either as a liability insurer defending third-party claims brought against policyholders or as an insurer
defending coverage claims brought against it. while the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings could be significant to the companys results of operations in a future quarter, in the opinion of the companys management it would not
be likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations for a calendar year or on the companys financial condition or liquidity.

on july 23, 2004, the company announced that it was seeking guidance from the staff of the division
of corporation finance of the securities exchange commission with respect to the appropriate purchase accounting treatment for certain second quarter 2004 adjustments totaling $1.63 billion ($1.07 billion after-tax). the company recorded these
adjustments as charges in its income statement in the second quarter of 2004. through an informal comment process, the staff of the division of corporation finance has subsequently asked for further information relating to these adjustments, and the
dialogue is ongoing. specifically, the staff has asked for information concerning the companys adjustments to certain of spcs insurance reserves and reserves for reinsurance recoverables and premiums due from policyholders, and how those
adjustments may relate to spcs reserves for periods prior to the merger. after reviewing the staffs questions and comments, the company continues to believe that its accounting treatment for these adjustments is appropriate. if, however,
the staff disagrees, some or all of the adjustments being discussed may not be recorded as charges in the companys income statement, thereby increasing net income for the second quarter and full year 2004 and increasing shareholders
equity at december 31, 2004, in each case by the approximate after-tax amount of the change. the effect on tangible shareholders equity (adjusted for the effects of deferred taxes associated with goodwill and intangible assets) at december 31,
2004 would not be material. increases to goodwill and deferred tax liabilities would be reflected on the companys balance sheet as of april1, 2004, either due to purchase accounting or adjustment of spcs reserves prior to the

monitors its exposure under these claims on a regular basis. the company believes reserves for reported claims are adequate, but it does not have information on unreported claims to estimate a range of additional liability. from 1997 to 2004, spc
purchased insurance to cover a portion of its exposure to such claims. under the sale agreement, spc also committed to acquire a minimum level of reinsurance brokerage services from aon through 2012. that commitment requires the company to make a
contractual payment to aon to the extent such minimum level of service is not acquired. the maximum annual amount payable to aon for such services and any such contractual payment related to that commitment is $20 million. spc also had commitments
under lease agreements through 2015 for vacated space (included in lease commitment totals in note 15), as well as a commitment to make payments to a former minet executive. the company assumed all obligations to these commitments upon consummation
of the merger.

contingencies, commitments and guarantees, continued
guarantees   the company has certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to agency loans and letters of credit, issuance of debt securities, third party
loans related to venture capital investments and various indemnifications related to the sale of business entities.   in the ordinary course of selling business entities to third parties, the company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of
representations and warranties with respect to the business entities being sold, covenants and obligations of the company and/or its subsidiaries following the close, and in certain cases obligations arising from undisclosed liabilities, adverse
reserve development, premium deficiencies or certain named litigation. such indemnification provisions generally survive for periods ranging from 12 months following the applicable closing date to the expiration of the relevant statutes of
limitations, or in some cases agreed upon term limitations. as of december 31, 2004, the aggregate amount of the companys quantifiable indemnification obligations in effect for sales of business entities was $1.94 billion. certain of these
contingent obligations are subject to deductibles which have to be incurred by the obligee before the company is obligated to make payments.

banking and financial functions, benefit coverages, data processing services, and short-term investment pool management services. charges for these shared services were allocated at cost. in connection with the citigroup distribution, tpc and
citigroup and its affiliates entered into a transition services agreement for the provision of certain of these services, tradename and trademark and similar agreements related to the use of trademarks, logos and tradenames and an amendment to the
march 26, 2002 intercompany agreement with citigroup. during the first quarter of 2002, citigroup provided investment advisory services on an allocated cost basis, consistent with prior years. on august 6, 2002, tpc entered into an investment

significant to the companys results of operations or financial condition.   included in revenues in the consolidated statement of income (loss) for 2002 was $520 million from the citigroup indemnification agreement.   in conjunction with the purchase of tighis outstanding shares in april 2000, tpc borrowed $2.20 billion pursuant to a

controls and proce
dures   the company
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (exchange act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
companys reports under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the companys management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. as a result of the merger of spc and tpc and the consolidation of the companys corporate headquarters in st. paul, minnesota, the company made a
number of significant changes in its internal controls over financial reporting beginning in the second quarter of 2004. the changes involved combining the financial reporting process and the attendant personnel and system changes. the
companys management, with the participation of the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of
december 31, 2004. based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures
provided reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to accomplish their objectives.   in addition, except as described above, there was no change in the companys internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in
rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the exchange act) that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting.

managements report on internal control over financial reporting   management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. the companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements of the company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. the companys accounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general
oversight of the companys audit committee.   the
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   management has assessed the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004. the standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are the measures in the
internal-control integrated framework published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.   based upon its assessment, management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective at december 31, 2004,
and that there were no material weaknesses in the companys internal control over financial reporting as of that date.   kpmg llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this form

reporting, that the st. paul travelers companies, inc., and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework
issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the st. paul travelers companies, inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.   we conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.   a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   because on its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   in our
opinion, managements assessment that the st. paul travelers companies, inc., and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria

public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheet of the st. paul travelers companies, inc., and subsidiaries as of december 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), changes
in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2004, and our report dated march 16, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

in 2002, in order to
achieve tax deductibility of executive compensation, a proposal was approved by spc shareholders that created the senior executive performance plan, which identifies a maximum bonus pool that could be available to the compensation committee for
possible award to the companys named executive officers. if a pool is available, the compensation committee, in its sole discretion, reviews both the companys and the individuals performance and determines what, if any, amounts
will be paid under the senior executive performance plan. generally, if the companys return on equity (which is determined by dividing the after-tax operating earnings for the performance period by beginning total common shareholders
equity) for a performance period is greater than 8%, the bonus pool available to the compensation committee will be equal to 1.5% of after-tax operating earnings. in assessing the companys and the individuals performance to determine
what, if any, amounts will actually be awarded, the compensation committee weighs the recent financial performance of the company or a business segment, as applicable, depending on the executive, as well as other short- and long-term objectives. in
this regard, the compensation committee considers operating income as the most appropriate indicator of recent financial performance, generally exclusive of the impact of factors beyond the executives control, for example catastrophes. the
compensation committee also considers other financial measures, as well as the degree to which objectives have been achieved and other qualitative factors, such as the strategic positioning of the company or the applicable business segment. for
bonuses and cap awards in respect of 2004, the compensation committee considered corporate integration and expense reduction after the merger of tpc and spc as important objectives. the available pool for 2004 was $27.6 million, of which the
compensation committee awarded to the named executive officers $5.0 million, comprised of approximately $3.7 million in cash and $1.3 million in shares of restricted stock pursuant to the companys capital accumulation program.

(a)
beginning in the second quarter of 2004, the company developed a methodology to allocate net investment income and invested assets to the identified segments. see note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this methodology. in 2002 and 2003, net investment income for each segment was accounted for separately, except for the portion earned on the investment of shareholders equity, which
was allocated based on assigned capital.
(b)
expense allocations are determined in accordance with prescribed statutory accounting practices. these practices make a reasonable allocation of all expenses to those product lines
with which they are associated.
