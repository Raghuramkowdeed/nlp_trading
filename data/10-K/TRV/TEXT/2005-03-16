THE ST. PAUL

TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY) IS A HOLDING COMPANY PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED, THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, IN PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES TO BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT UNITS, ASSOCIATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. IT ALSO HAS A PRESENCE IN THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY THROUGH ITS 79% MAJORITY OWNERSHIP OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INC. (NUVEEN INVESTMENTS). THE COMPANY, KNOWN AS THE ST.

PAUL COMPANIES, INC. (SPC) PRIOR TO ITS MERGER WITH TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC), IS INCORPORATED AS A GENERAL BUSINESS CORPORATION UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA AND IS ONE OF THE OLDEST INSURANCE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES, DATING BACK TO 1853. THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF THE COMPANY ARE LOCATED AT 385 WASHINGTON STREET, ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA 55102, AND THE TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (651) 310-7911.

ON APRIL 1, 2004, TPC MERGED WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF SPC, AS A RESULT OF WHICH TPC BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF SPC, AND

SPC CHANGED ITS NAME TO THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE ACQUISITION WITH TPC TREATED AS THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIRER. ACCORDINGLY, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION, USING TPCS HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND APPLYING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS OF SPC AS OF APRIL 1, 2004. BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF SPC WERE CONSOLIDATED WITH TPCS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ACCORDINGLY, ALL FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTS OF TPC FOR

THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 AND THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS OF SPC AND TPC FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTS OF TPC. IN CONNECTION WITH

THE MERGER, EACH ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARE OF TPC CLASS A AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK (INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS) WAS EXCHANGED FOR 0.4334 OF A SHARE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. ALL SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS

FOR ALL PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE EXCHANGE OF TPCS COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.01 PER SHARE, FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK WITHOUT DESIGNATED PAR VALUE, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO SHARE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE TPC

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN 2002.

TPC IS A CONNECTICUT

CORPORATION THAT WAS FORMED IN 1979 AND, PRIOR TO ITS MARCH 2002 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK (IPO), WAS AN INDIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CITIGROUP INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, CITIGROUP). TPC WAS

REORGANIZED IN CONNECTION WITH ITS IPO IN MARCH 2002. PURSUANT TO THE REORGANIZATION, WHICH WAS COMPLETED ON MARCH 19, 2002, TPCS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN FORMERLY WHOLLY-OWNED TPC

SUBSIDIARIES, PRINCIPALLY THE TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (BEING THE FORMER U.S. LIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS OF TPC), CERTAIN OTHER WHOLLY-OWNED NON-INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES OF TPC AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF TPCS ASSETS AND

CERTAIN LIABILITIES NOT RELATED TO THE PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE BUSINESS.

IN THE IPO, ON MARCH 21, 2002, TPC ISSUED 231 MILLION SHARES* OF ITS CLASS A COMMON STOCK, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 23% OF TPCS COMMON EQUITY. AFTER THE IPO, CITIGROUP INC. BENEFICIALLY OWNED ALL OF THE 500

MILLION SHARES* OF TPCS OUTSTANDING CLASS B COMMON STOCK, EACH SHARE OF WHICH WAS ENTITLED TO SEVEN VOTES, AND 269 MILLION SHARES* OF TPCS CLASS A COMMON STOCK, EACH SHARE OF WHICH WAS ENTITLED TO ONE VOTE, REPRESENTING AT THE TIME 94%

OF THE COMBINED VOTING POWER OF ALL CLASSES OF TPCS VOTING SECURITIES AND 77% OF THE EQUITY INTEREST IN TPC. ON AUGUST 20, 2002, CITIGROUP MADE A TAX-FREE DISTRIBUTION TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS (THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION), OF A PORTION OF ITS

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TPC, WHICH, TOGETHER WITH THE SHARES ISSUED IN THE IPO, REPRESENTED MORE THAN 90% OF TPCS COMMON EQUITY AND MORE THAN 90% OF THE COMBINED VOTING POWER OF TPCS OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES. CITIGROUP RECEIVED A

PRIVATE LETTER RULING FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE THAT THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION WAS TAX-FREE TO CITIGROUP, ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND TPC. AS PART OF THE RULING

*

SHARE AMOUNTS ARE UNADJUSTED FOR THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC.

PROCESS, CITIGROUP AGREED TO VOTE THE SHARES IT CONTINUED TO HOLD OF TPC FOLLOWING THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION PRO RATA WITH THE SHARES HELD BY THE PUBLIC AND

TO DIVEST THE REMAINING SHARES IT HOLDS WITHIN FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION. AFTER THE MERGER, THIS UNDERTAKING ALSO APPLIES TO SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, CITIGROUP HELD FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT 6.50% OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. AT DECEMBER

31, 2003 AND 2002, CITIGROUP HELD FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT 9.87% AND 9.95%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TPCS COMMON EQUITY AND 9.87% AND 9.98%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMBINED VOTING POWER OF TPCS OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES.

AND FIDELITY. GULF ALSO PROVIDED INSURANCE PRODUCTS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING LEVELS FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED BASED UPON THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF ESTIMATED LOSSES,

THE EXPENSES OF PRODUCING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT. COMMERCIAL HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES A PROFIT-ORIENTATION RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE.

COMMERCIAL HAS DEVELOPED AN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING

METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINES FOR PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DISCIPLINE. IT UTILIZES PROPRIETARY

DATA GATHERED AND ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO ITS COMMERCIAL BUSINESS OVER MANY YEARS. THE UNDERWRITERS AND ENGINEERS USE THIS INFORMATION TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE RISKS PRIOR TO QUOTATION. THIS INFORMATION PROVIDES SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SPECIFIC

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. THIS METHODOLOGY ENABLES COMMERCIAL TO STREAMLINE ITS RISK SELECTION PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING PARAMETERS THAT WILL NOT COMPROMISE COMMERCIALS UNDERWRITING INTEGRITY.

FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES, SELECT ACCOUNTS USES A PROCESS BASED ON INDUSTRY

CLASSIFICATIONS TO ALLOW AGENTS AND FIELD UNDERWRITING REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DECISIONS WITHIN PREDETERMINED CLASSIFICATIONS, BECAUSE UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND PRICING TEND TO BE MORE STANDARDIZED FOR THESE SMALLER

EXPOSURES.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF COMMERCIAL BUSINESS IS

WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER SOME WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED

BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, AND IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK UNTIL SUCH REIMBURSEMENT IS MADE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ON UNPAID LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES WERE EACH

APPROXIMATELY $4.21 BILLION. RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES ARE ALSO USED FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE. ALTHOUGH THE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED FEATURE OF THE POLICY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES INSURANCE RISK FOR THE COMPANY, IT DOES INTRODUCE

CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY. RECEIVABLES ON UNPAID LOSSES FROM HOLDERS OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $267 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT CASH

COLLATERAL AND SURETY BONDS, IS GENERALLY REQUESTED FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PLANS AND/OR RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES THAT PROVIDE FOR DEFERRED COLLECTION OF DEDUCTIBLE RECOVERIES AND/OR ULTIMATE PREMIUMS. THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL REQUESTED IS

PREDICATED UPON THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER AND THE NATURE OF THE INSURED RISKS. COMMERCIAL CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE CREDIT EXPOSURE ON INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS AND THE ADEQUACY OF COLLATERAL.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO NATURAL AND MANMADE PERIL

CATASTROPHIC LOSSES AND ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE SUCH EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY USES SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER MODELING TECHNIQUES TO ANALYZE

UNDERWRITING RISKS OF BUSINESS IN HURRICANE-PRONE, EARTHQUAKE-PRONE AND TARGET RISK AREAS. THE COMPANY RELIES UPON THIS ANALYSIS TO MAKE UNDERWRITING

PRINCIPAL MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION

SPECIALTY DISTRIBUTES THE MAJORITY OF ITS SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS THROUGH THE SAME BASE OF APPROXIMATELY 6,200

INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS THAT DISTRIBUTE THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENTS PRODUCTS. THESE BROKERS AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND ARE SERVICED BY THREE CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTERS. IN RECENT YEARS, SPECIALTY

HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ENHANCED TECHNOLOGY UTILIZING INTERNET-BASED APPLICATIONS TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME INTERFACE CAPABILITIES WITH ITS INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS. SPECIALTY BUILDS RELATIONSHIPS WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED, INDEPENDENT

INSURANCE AGENCIES AND BROKERS. IN SELECTING NEW INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, SPECIALTY CONSIDERS EACH AGENCYS OR BROKERS PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL STABILITY, STAFF EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH ITS

OPERATING AND MARKETING PLANS. ONCE AN AGENCY OR BROKER IS APPOINTED, SPECIALTY CAREFULLY MONITORS ITS PERFORMANCE.

SPECIALTY ALSO DISTRIBUTES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY PRODUCTS THROUGH SELECTED WHOLESALERS USING SURPLUS LINES PAPER, BOTH ON A BROKERAGE AND MANAGING GENERAL

UNDERWRITING BASIS. WHOLESALERS ARE USED BECAUSE THEY SERVE CERTAIN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT TYPICALLY SERVED BY OUR APPOINTED RETAIL AGENTS. THE WHOLESALE SURPLUS LINES MARKET ALLOWS FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY TO WRITE CERTAIN CLASSES OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE

ABSENCE OF RATE AND FORM REGULATION FOR SURPLUS LINES BUSINESS. IN WORKING WITH WHOLESALERS ON A BROKERAGE BASIS, SPECIALTY UNDERWRITES THE BUSINESS AND SETS THE PREMIUM LEVEL. IN WORKING WITH WHOLESALERS ON A MANAGING GENERAL UNDERWRITING (MGU)

BASIS, THE MGUS PRODUCE AND UNDERWRITE BUSINESS THAT CONFORMS TO SPECIALTYS UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR EACH FACILITY.

SPECIALTY DISTRIBUTES ITS SPECIALTY PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH BROKERS IN THE DOMESTIC MARKETS OF EACH OF THE THREE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. SPECIALTY ALSO WRITES BUSINESS AT LLOYDS, WHERE ITS PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH LLOYDS ACCREDITED BROKERS AND, BY VIRTUE OF LLOYDS

WORLDWIDE LICENSES, SPECIALTY HAS ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS ACROSS THE WORLD.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING LEVELS FOR

SPECIALTY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY DEVELOPED BASED UPON THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF ESTIMATED LOSSES, THE EXPENSES OF PRODUCING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT. SPECIALTY HAS A

DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES PROFIT ORIENTATION RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE.

SPECIALTY HAS DEVELOPED AN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES DEDICATED UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINES FOR PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DISCIPLINE, BASED ON AN IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIFIC INDUSTRY. THE UNDERWRITERS AND ENGINEERS USE PROPRIETARY DATA

GATHERED AND ANALYZED OVER MANY YEARS TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE RISKS PRIOR TO QUOTATION, AND THEN USE THE MORE THAN 4,000 PROPRIETARY FORMS TO TAILOR INSURANCE COVERAGE TO TARGET MARKETS. THIS METHODOLOGY ENABLES SPECIALTY TO STREAMLINE ITS RISK

SELECTION PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING PARAMETERS THAT WILL NOT COMPROMISE ITS UNDERWRITING INTEGRITY.

A PORTION OF SPECIALTY BUSINESS IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER SOME WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH

DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, SPECIALTY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. SPECIALTY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT AND IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK UNTIL SUCH REIMBURSEMENT IS MADE. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004, CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ON UNPAID LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES WERE EACH APPROXIMATELY $1.41 BILLION. SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT SURETY BONDS AND

CASH COLLATERAL, IS GENERALLY REQUESTED FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PLANS THAT PROVIDE FOR DEFERRED COLLECTION OF DEDUCTIBLES. THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL REQUESTED IS PREDICATED UPON THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER AND THE NATURE OF THE INSURED RISKS.

SPECIALTY CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE CREDIT EXPOSURE AND THE ADEQUACY OF COLLATERAL.

PRODUCT LINES

GENERAL LIABILITY

COMPANYS ST. PAUL GUARANTEE (CANADA) AND AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES (MEXICO) SUBSIDIARIES.

WORKERS COMPENSATION

WORKERS COMPENSATION POLICIES: MEDICAL BENEFITS, DISABILITY BENEFITS, DEATH BENEFITS AND VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION BENEFITS. THE COMPANY EMPHASIZES MANAGED CARE COST CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES, WHICH INVOLVE EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES AND CARE PROVIDERS

IN A COOPERATIVE EFFORT THAT FOCUSES ON THE INJURED EMPLOYEES EARLY RETURN TO WORK, COST-EFFECTIVE, QUALITY CARE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THIS MARKET.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR BUSINESSES AGAINST LOSSES INCURRED FROM PERSONAL BODILY INJURY, BODILY INJURY TO THIRD PARTIES,

PROPERTY DAMAGE TO AN INSUREDS VEHICLE, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE TO OTHER VEHICLES AND OTHER PROPERTY RESULTING FROM THE OWNERSHIP, MAINTENANCE OR USE OF AUTOMOBILES AND TRUCKS IN A BUSINESS.

INTERRUPTION RESULTING FROM COVERED PROPERTY DAMAGE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON TERRORISM COVERAGES, SEE REINSURANCETERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002. PROPERTY ALSO INCLUDES SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT INSURANCE, WHICH PROVIDES

COVERAGE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN OF BOILERS AND MACHINERY, AND OCEAN AND INLAND MARINE INSURANCE, WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR GOODS IN TRANSIT, AND UNIQUE ONE-OF-A-KIND EXPOSURES.

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY AND

LIABILITY COVERAGE. PROPERTY INSURANCE COVERS DAMAGES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY FIRE, WIND, HAIL, WATER, THEFT AND VANDALISM, AND PROTECTS BUSINESSES FROM FINANCIAL LOSS DUE TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION RESULTING FROM A COVERED LOSS. LIABILITY COVERAGE

INSURES BUSINESSES AGAINST THIRD PARTIES FROM ACCIDENTS OCCURRING ON THEIR PREMISES OR ARISING OUT OF THEIR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS INJURIES SUSTAINED FROM PRODUCTS SOLD.

INTERNATIONAL

PROVIDES COVERAGE THROUGH NON-U.S. INSURANCE MARKETS, PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, CANADA, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND AT LLOYDS. THE COVERAGE PROVIDED IN THOSE MARKETS INCLUDES EMPLOYERS LIABILITY (SIMILAR TO WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES), PUBLIC AND PRODUCT LIABILITY (THE

EQUIVALENT OF GENERAL LIABILITY), PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY (SIMILAR TO DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COVERAGES), MOTOR (SIMILAR TO AUTOMOBILE COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES) AND PROPERTY. WHILE THE COVERED HAZARD MAY BE SIMILAR TO

THOSE IN THE U.S. MARKET, THE DIFFERENT LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS CAN MAKE THE PRODUCT RISKS AND COVERAGE TERMS POTENTIALLY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONAL DOES NOT INCLUDE SURETY BUSINESS WRITTEN IN THE COMPANYS ST.

PAUL GUARANTEE AND AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES SUBSIDIARIES.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PERSONAL OPERATES SINGLE STATE COMPANIES IN MASSACHUSETTS, NEW JERSEY AND FLORIDA WITH PRODUCTS MARKETED

PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS. THESE STATES REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 20% OF PERSONAL DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2004. THE COMPANIES WERE ESTABLISHED TO MANAGE COMPLEX MARKETS IN MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW JERSEY AND PROPERTY CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE

IN FLORIDA. EACH COMPANY HAS DEDICATED RESOURCES IN UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, FINANCE, LEGAL AND SERVICE FUNCTIONS.

PERSONAL USES A CONSISTENT OPERATING MODEL WITH AGENTS OUTSIDE OF THE SINGLE STATE COMPANIES (SEE DISCUSSION ABOVE). THE MODEL PROVIDES TECHNOLOGICAL

ALTERNATIVES TO AGENTS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR EASE OF DOING BUSINESS. PERSONAL AGENTS QUOTE AND ISSUE APPROXIMATELY 97% OF PERSONALS POLICIES DIRECTLY FROM THEIR AGENCIES BY LEVERAGING EITHER THEIR OWN AGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR USING

PERSONALS PROPRIETARY QUOTE AND ISSUANCE SYSTEMS WHICH ALLOWS AGENTS TO RATE, QUOTE AND ISSUE POLICIES ON LINE. ALL OF THESE QUOTE AND ISSUE PLATFORMS INTERFACE WITH THE PERSONALS UNDERWRITING AND RATING SYSTEMS, WHICH EDIT TRANSACTIONS

FOR COMPLIANCE WITH PERSONALS UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PROGRAMS. BUSINESS PROCESSED BY AGENTS ON THESE PLATFORMS IS SUBJECTED TO CONSULTATIVE REVIEW BY PERSONALS IN-HOUSE UNDERWRITERS. IN THE PAST YEAR, PERSONAL CONTINUED TO INCREASE USE

OF INTERNET-BASED PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS, AND AGENTS HAVE TRANSITIONED APPROXIMATELY 96% OF PERSONALS NEW BUSINESS TO THESE PLATFORMS. PERSONAL ALSO PROVIDES A DOWNLOAD CAPABILITY THAT REFRESHES THE INDIVIDUAL AGENCY SYSTEM DATABASES OF

APPROXIMATELY 4,100 AGENTS EACH DAY WITH UPDATED POLICY INFORMATION.

PERSONAL CONTINUES TO DEVELOP FUNCTIONALITY TO PROVIDE ITS AGENTS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF ONLINE SERVICE CAPABILITIES PACKAGED TOGETHER IN AN EASY-TO-USE AGENCY SERVICE PORTAL, INCLUDING CUSTOMER SERVICE, MARKETING AND CLAIM

FUNCTIONALITY. AGENCIES CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO SHIFT THE ONGOING CORE SERVICE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERSONALS CUSTOMERS TO ONE OF THE COMPANYS FOUR CUSTOMER CARE CENTERS, WHERE THE COMPANY FUNCTIONS AS AN EXTENSION OF AN AGENCYS SERVICING

OPERATION BY PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF DIRECT CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS, INCLUDING RESPONSE TO BILLING AND COVERAGE INQUIRIES, AND POLICY CHANGES. APPROXIMATELY 1,100 AGENTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SERVICE ALTERNATIVE.

PERSONAL ALSO MARKETS THROUGH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INCLUDING

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS EMPLOYERS AND CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS, AND JOINT MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER INSURERS. PERSONAL HANDLES THE SALES AND SERVICE FOR THESE PROGRAMS EITHER THROUGH A SPONSORING INDEPENDENT AGENT OR THROUGH TWO OF THE

COMPANYS CALL CENTER LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY IS ONE OF THE LEADING PROVIDERS OF PERSONAL LINES PRODUCTS TO MEMBERS OF AFFINITY GROUPS. A NUMBER OF WELL-KNOWN CORPORATIONS ENDORSE THE COMPANYS PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES PRIMARILY

THROUGH A PAYROLL DEDUCTION PAYMENT PROCESS. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION (AAA) CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER AFFINITY GROUPS THAT ENDORSE PERSONALS TAILORED

OFFERINGS TO THEIR MEMBERS. SINCE 1995, THE COMPANY HAS HAD A MARKETING AGREEMENT WITH GEICO TO RECEIVE REFERRALS FOR HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS. THIS AGREEMENT HAS ADDED PROFITABLE BUSINESS AND HELPED TO GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSIFY THE HOMEOWNERS LINE OF

BUSINESS.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING LEVELS FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE

GENERALLY DEVELOPED BASED UPON THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF INCURRED LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE, THE EXPENSES OF PRODUCING BUSINESS AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT AND CONTINGENCIES. THE COMPANY HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO

UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT PLACES EMPHASIS ON UNDERWRITING PROFIT RATHER THAN MARKET SHARE.

PERSONAL HAS DEVELOPED A PRODUCT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT INTEGRATES THE DISCIPLINES OF UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THIS

APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING DISCIPLINE AND PRICING SEGMENTATION. PROPRIETARY DATA IS ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO PERSONALS BUSINESS OVER MANY YEARS. PERSONAL USES A VARIETY OF PROPRIETARY AND VENDOR PRODUCED RISK

DIFFERENTIATION MODELS TO FACILITATE ITS PRICING SEGMENTATION. PERSONALS PRODUCT MANAGERS ESTABLISH STRICT UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES INTEGRATED WITH ITS FILED PRICING AND RATING PLANS, WHICH ENABLE PERSONAL TO STREAMLINE ITS RISK SELECTION AND

PRICING PROCESSES.

PRICING FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE

IS DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF AUTOMOBILE REPAIRS, MEDICAL CARE AND LITIGATION OF LIABILITY CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE PROFITABILITY OF THE

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BUSINESS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON PROMPTLY IDENTIFYING AND RECTIFYING DISPARITIES BETWEEN PREMIUM LEVELS AND PROJECTED CLAIM COSTS, AND OBTAINING APPROVAL

FROM STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WHEN NECESSARY FOR FILED RATE CHANGES.

PRICING IN THE HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS IS ALSO DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF BUILDING SUPPLIES, LABOR AND HOUSEHOLD POSSESSIONS. MOST HOMEOWNERS POLICIES OFFER, BUT DO NOT

REQUIRE, AUTOMATIC INCREASES IN COVERAGE TO REFLECT GROWTH IN REPLACEMENT COSTS AND PROPERTY VALUES. IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY MULTIPLE PERIL COVERAGE, THE PROFITABILITY AND PRICING OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IS AFFECTED BY

THE INCIDENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, PARTICULARLY HURRICANES, WINTER STORMS, WIND AND HAIL, WATER DAMAGE, EARTHQUAKES AND TORNADOES. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, PERSONAL HAS LIMITED THE WRITING OF NEW

HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS AND SELECTIVELY NON-RENEWED EXISTING HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS IN SOME MARKETS. IN ADDITION, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED, PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN SOME CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS, AND DEDUCTIBLES HAVE BEEN

PUT IN PLACE IN HURRICANE AND WIND AND HAIL PRONE AREAS. PERSONAL USES COMPUTER-MODELING TECHNIQUES TO ASSESS ITS LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS. CHANGES TO METHODS OF MARKETING AND UNDERWRITING IN SOME

JURISDICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO STATE-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, WHICH CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN INSURER TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES.

INSURERS WRITING PERSONAL LINES PROPERTY CASUALTY POLICIES MAY BE UNABLE TO INCREASE PRICES UNTIL SOME TIME AFTER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COVERAGE HAVE

INCREASED, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF STATE INSURANCE RATE REGULATION. THE PACE AT WHICH AN INSURER CAN CHANGE RATES IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED COSTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON WHETHER THE APPLICABLE STATE LAW REQUIRES PRIOR APPROVAL OF RATE INCREASES OR

NOTIFICATION TO THE REGULATOR EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER A RATE CHANGE IS IMPOSED. IN STATES WITH PRIOR APPROVAL LAWS, RATES MUST BE APPROVED BY THE REGULATOR BEFORE BEING USED BY THE INSURER. IN STATES HAVING FILE-AND-USE LAWS, THE INSURER

MUST FILE RATE CHANGES WITH THE REGULATOR, BUT DOES NOT NEED TO WAIT FOR APPROVAL BEFORE USING THE NEW RATES. A USE-AND-FILE LAW REQUIRES AN INSURER TO FILE RATES WITHIN A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE INSURER BEGINS USING THE NEW RATE.

APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE STATES REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL OF MOST RATE CHANGES.

INDEPENDENT AGENTS EITHER SUBMIT APPLICATIONS TO THE COMPANYS SERVICE CENTERS FOR UNDERWRITING REVIEW, QUOTE, AND ISSUANCE OR THEY UTILIZE ONE OF ITS AUTOMATED QUOTE AND ISSUE SYSTEMS. AUTOMATED TRANSACTIONS ARE

EDITED BY THE COMPANYS SYSTEMS AND ISSUED IF THEY CONFORM TO ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. EXCEPTIONS ARE REVIEWED BY UNDERWRITERS IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS CENTERS OR BY AGENCY MANAGERS. AUDITS ARE CONDUCTED BY BUSINESS CENTER UNDERWRITERS AND

AGENCY MANAGERS, ON A SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING BASIS, ACROSS ALL OF THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT AGENCY GENERATED BUSINESS. EACH AGENT IS ASSIGNED TO A SPECIFIC EMPLOYEE OR TEAM OF EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THE AGENT ON BUSINESS PLAN

DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND OVERALL GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY USES AGENCY LEVEL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION TO ANALYZE AND UNDERSTAND RESULTS AND TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES.

THE PERSONAL PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH ADDITIONAL MARKETING CHANNELS ARE

UNDERWRITTEN BY THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES. UNDERWRITERS WORK WITH THE COMPANY MANAGEMENT ON BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND OVERALL GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. CHANNEL-SPECIFIC PRODUCTION AND CLAIM INFORMATION IS USED TO ANALYZE RESULTS

AND IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES.

PRODUCT LINES

THE PRIMARY COVERAGES IN PERSONAL ARE PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS

INSURANCE SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS. PERSONAL HAD APPROXIMATELY 6.1 MILLION POLICIES IN FORCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY TO OTHERS FOR BOTH BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE AND FOR PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO AN

$36.98 BILLION OF RETAIL MANAGED ACCOUNTS, $15.58 BILLION OF INSTITUTIONAL MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND $12.68 BILLION OF MUTUAL FUNDS.

ON JANUARY 31, 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES FOR DIVESTITURE OF OWNERSHIP OF ITS 79% SHARE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS. THE

PROPOSED DIVESTITURE REFLECTS THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC DECISION TO FOCUS ON ITS PROPERTY-CASUALTY BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES A SALE WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS.

ON MARCH 3, 2005, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS FILED A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANYS

INTENTION TO EXPLORE ITS STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES WITH RESPECT TO ITS EQUITY INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING A PUBLIC OFFERING OR A SALE TO A THIRD PARTY.

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANYS CLAIMS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND ITS EXECUTION ARE CRITICAL TO OPERATING RESULTS AND BUSINESS RETENTION. CLAIM PAYOUT AND EXPENSE

REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF EVERY PREMIUM DOLLAR THE COMPANY EARNS. THE COMPANYS CLAIMS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS BASED ON FOUR CORE TENETS.



FAIR, EFFICIENT, FACT-BASED CLAIMS MANAGEMENT CONTROLS LOSSES FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS CUSTOMERS;



USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES FRONT-LINE CLAIMS PROFESSIONALS WITH NECESSARY INFORMATION AND FACILITATES PROMPT CLAIM RESOLUTION;



SPECIALIZATION OF CLAIMS PROFESSIONALS AND SEGMENTATION OF CLAIMS BY COMPLEXITY, AS INDICATED BY SEVERITY, COVERAGE AND CAUSATION, ALLOW THE COMPANY TO FOCUS ITS RESOURCES

EFFECTIVELY; AND



EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE ENHANCES CUSTOMER RETENTION.

CLAIM SERVICES EMPLOYS A DIVERSE GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS, INCLUDING CLAIM ADJUSTERS, APPRAISERS, ATTORNEYS, INVESTIGATORS, SYSTEM SPECIALISTS AND TRAINING,

MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL. APPROVED EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS INDEPENDENT ADJUSTERS AND APPRAISERS, INVESTIGATORS AND ATTORNEYS, ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE AS APPROPRIATE.

FIELD CLAIM MANAGEMENT TEAMS LOCATED IN 72 OFFICES IN 45 STATES ARE ORGANIZED TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC CLAIM

CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE TO THE BUSINESSES WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL, PERSONAL AND SPECIALTY SEGMENTS. CLAIM TEAMS WITH SPECIALIZED SKILLS, RESOURCES, AND WORKFLOWS ARE MATCHED TO THE UNIQUE EXPOSURES OF THOSE BUSINESSES WITH LOCAL CLAIM MANAGEMENT

DEDICATED TO ACHIEVING OPTIMAL RESULTS WITHIN EACH SEGMENT. THE COMPANYS HOME OFFICE OPERATIONS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF WORKFLOW DESIGN, QUALITY MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCED MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND DATA

ANALYSIS, TRAINING, FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONTROL, AND HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY. IN ADDITION TO THE FIELD TEAMS, CLAIM STAFF IS DEDICATED TO EACH OF PERSONALS SINGLE STATE COMPANIES IN FLORIDA, MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW JERSEY. THIS STRUCTURE

PERMITS THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF A LARGER, ESTABLISHED COMPANY WHILE RETAINING THE AGILITY TO RESPOND PROMPTLY TO THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS, BROKERS, AGENTS AND UNDERWRITERS.

AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANYS STRATEGY TO BENEFIT CUSTOMERS AND

SHAREHOLDERS IS ITS CONTINUING LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INSURANCE FRAUD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CLAIM SERVICES USES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, AND DATA ANALYSIS TO ASSIST THE COMPANY

IN REVIEWING ITS CLAIM PRACTICES AND RESULTS TO EVALUATE AND IMPROVE ITS PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANYS CLAIM MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON SEGMENTATION OF CLAIMS AND APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL SPECIALIZATION TO DRIVE EFFECTIVE CLAIM RESOLUTION. THE

COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS INVESTMENT IN CLAIM RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE FOCUS ON CLAIM OUTCOMES. IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN ITS PERSONAL CLAIM HANDLING OPERATIONS AND EXPANDED ITS

CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM. THE COMPANY HAS EMBARKED UPON A SERIES OF PROCESS RE-ENGINEERING PILOTS, IN BOTH AUTO AND PROPERTY. TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE PILOTS SHOW FAVORABLE RESULTS, THE COMPANY WOULD ANTICIPATE ROLLING THEM OUT MORE

BROADLY IN 2005. THE COMPANYS PROVEN CATASTROPHE RESPONSE STRATEGY AND ITS CATASTROPHE CLAIM HANDLING TEAMS WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN ITS RESPONSE TO A VARIETY OF WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES THAT IMPACTED THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN 2004, INCLUDING

HURRICANES CHARLEY, FRANCES, IVAN AND JEANNE, AN UNPRECEDENTED SERIES OF SIGNIFICANT STORMS THAT STRUCK THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES IN THE THIRD QUARTER.

THE COMPANY IS A LEADING USER OF DIGITAL AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY AND BROWSER-BASED CLAIM PROCESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, TRAVGLASS

SM

, THE COMPANYS INTERNET-BASED CLAIMS APPLICATION, INCLUDES A NETWORK OF PRE-APPROVED AND CUSTOMER OR AGENT SELECTED GLASS

REPAIR PROVIDERS AND ENABLES THE COMPANY TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MEET ITS CUSTOMERS AUTOMOBILE GLASS REPAIR NEEDS.

ANOTHER STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IS TRAVCOMP

SM

, A WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIM RESOLUTION AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT ASSISTS ADJUSTERS IN THE PROMPT INVESTIGATION AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS. INNOVATIVE MEDICAL AND CLAIMS

MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES PERMIT NURSE, MEDICAL AND CLAIMS PROFESSIONALS TO SHARE APPROPRIATE VITAL INFORMATION THAT SUPPORTS PROMPT INVESTIGATION, EFFECTIVE RETURN TO WORK AND CLAIM RESOLUTION STRATEGIES. THESE TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH EFFECTIVE

MATCHING OF PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND AUTHORITY TO SPECIFIC CLAIM ISSUES, HAVE RESULTED IN MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS WITH LOWER MEDICAL, WAGE REPLACEMENT COSTS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY REINSURES A PORTION OF THE RISKS IT UNDERWRITES IN ORDER TO CONTROL ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES AND PROTECT CAPITAL

RESOURCES. THE COMPANY CEDES TO REINSURERS A PORTION OF THESE RISKS AND PAYS PREMIUMS BASED UPON THE RISK AND EXPOSURE OF THE POLICIES SUBJECT TO SUCH REINSURANCE. CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES CREDIT RISK, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO MANDATORY POOLS, AND IS

GENERALLY SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF THE REINSURANCE CEDED, THE COMPANY REMAINS LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED AFTER

REDUCTIONS FOR KNOWN INSOLVENCIES AND AFTER ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS COLLATERAL, INCLUDING TRUST AGREEMENTS, ESCROW FUNDS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, UNDER CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF REINSURERS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND REVIEWS ITS REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS PERIODICALLY. REINSURERS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION CONCERNING REINSURANCE, SEE NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS TO CONTROL ITS EXPOSURE TO LARGE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY LOSSES, INCLUDING.



FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE INSURANCE PROVIDED BY A SINGLE POLICY AND EACH POLICY REINSURED IS SEPARATELY NEGOTIATED;



TREATY REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR A SPECIFIED TYPE OR CATEGORY OF RISKS; AND



CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE, IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INDEMNIFIED FOR AN AMOUNT OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED RETENTION WITH RESPECT TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM A CATASTROPHIC EVENT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2004, THE COMPANY HAD REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES FROM SYNDICATES AT LLOYDS OF $738 MILLION. IN 1996, LLOYDS RESTRUCTURED ITS OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 1993 AND REINSURED THESE INTO EQUITAS LIMITED, WHICH IS

CURRENTLY UNRATED. APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION OF THE COMPANYS LLOYDS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 RELATES TO EQUITAS LIABILITIES. THE REMAINING RECOVERABLES OF $648 MILLION ARE FROM THE CONTINUING MARKET OF LLOYDS,

WHICH IS RATED A (3RD HIGHEST OF 16 RATINGS) BY A.M. BEST. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, TPC ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE REINSURANCE CLAIMS AGAINST CERTAIN UNDERWRITERS AT LLOYDS REINSURED BY EQUITAS. UNDER

TERMS OF THIS SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $245 MILLION, RESOLVING APPROXIMATELY $255 MILLION OF TPCS NET CLAIM BALANCES FROM EQUITAS. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE $90 MILLION REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES RELATING TO EQUITAS REMAINING AT DECEMBER 31,

2004 RELATE TO SPC.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD

$19.05 BILLION IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. OF THIS AMOUNT, $2.50 BILLION IS FOR MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS THAT RELATE PRIMARILY TO WORKERS COMPENSATION SERVICE BUSINESS AND HAVE THE OBLIGATION OF THE PARTICIPATING INSURANCE COMPANIES

ON A JOINT AND SEVERAL BASIS SUPPORTING THESE CESSIONS. AN ADDITIONAL $3.94 BILLION OF THIS AMOUNT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS RELATING PRIMARILY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS

CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF ANY DEFAULTS BY THE COMPANIES ISSUING THE ANNUITIES. OF THE REMAINING $12.61 BILLION CEDED TO REINSURERS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, $1.50 BILLION IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, AND THE REMAINDER

PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS REINSURANCE IN SUPPORT OF ONGOING AND RUNOFF BUSINESS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, $2.8 BILLION OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES WERE COLLATERALIZED BY LETTERS OF CREDIT, TRUST AGREEMENTS AND ESCROW FUNDS. ALSO AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE

COMPANY HAD AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES OF $751 MILLION.

FOR A DESCRIPTION OF REINSURANCE RELATED LITIGATION, SEE ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

CURRENT NET RETENTION POLICY

THE DESCRIPTIONS BELOW RELATE TO THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN EFFECT AT JANUARY 1, 2005. MOST PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS HAVE TERRORISM SUBLIMITS OR EXCLUSIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PURCHASE TREATY REINSURANCE FOR LOSSES ARISING FROM WORKERS COMPENSATION POLICIES. FOR THIRD PARTY LIABILITY, INCLUDING AUTOMOBILE NO-FAULT, THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT USED

BY COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY LIMITS THE NET RETENTION TO A MAXIMUM OF $8 MILLION PER INSURED, PER OCCURRENCE. FOR THIRD PARTY LIABILITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY, AND EMPLOYMENT

PRACTICES LIABILITY, THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS USED BY SPECIALTY GENERALLY LIMIT THE NET RETENTIONS FROM $4 MILLION TO $16 MILLION PER POLICY. FOR THIRD PARTY LIABILITY, NATIONAL ACCOUNTS LIMITS ITS EXPOSURE BY UTILIZING FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE.

REINSURANCE IS ALSO USED TO LIMIT THE NET RETAINED AMOUNT PER RISK TO $15 MILLION FOR COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY PROPERTY. FOR SURETY PROTECTION, THE COMPANY GENERALLY RETAINS UP TO $24.5 MILLION PROBABLE MAXIMUM LOSS (PML) PER PRINCIPAL BUT MAY

RETAIN HIGHER AMOUNTS BASED ON THE TYPE OF OBLIGATION, CREDIT QUALITY AND OTHER CREDIT RISK FACTORS. PERSONAL RETAINS THE FIRST $5 MILLION OF UMBRELLA POLICIES AND PURCHASES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE FOR LIMITS OVER $5 MILLION. FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY

INSURANCE, THERE IS A $6 MILLION MAXIMUM RETENTION PER RISK. THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIMITS CAPACITY OR TO REDUCE RETENTIONS ON AN INDIVIDUAL RISK BASIS. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO RETAIN AMOUNTS GREATER

THAN THOSE DESCRIBED HEREIN BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RISK.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH NONAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO CONTROL ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM ONE OCCURRENCE. FOR THE

ACCUMULATION OF NET PROPERTY LOSSES ARISING OUT OF ONE OCCURRENCE, THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE AGREEMENT COVERS 60% OF TOTAL LOSSES BETWEEN $750 MILLION AND $2 BILLION. THIS AGREEMENT EXCLUDES NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL LOSSES FOR DOMESTIC

TERRORISM AND ALL TERRORISM LOSSES AS DEFINED BY THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002. THIS AGREEMENT COVERS ALL OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS EXCEPT THAT BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, AND THROUGH THE

COMPANYS LLOYDS OPERATIONS, WHERE SEPARATE CATASTROPHE COVERAGE IS PURCHASED LOCALLY AND GENERALLY RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET LOSS EXPOSURE LEVELS THAN IN THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS AN ONGOING REVIEW

OF ITS RISK AND CATASTROPHE COVERAGES AND MAKES CHANGES IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002

ON

NOVEMBER 26, 2002, THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 (THE TERRORISM ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW AND ESTABLISHED THE TERRORISM INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM), A TEMPORARY FEDERAL PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THAT PROVIDES

FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN INTEREST. IN ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST BE

THE RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF TREASURY. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE TERRORISM ACT. THE TERRORISM ACT GENERALLY

REQUIRES THAT ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM TERMINATES ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT FOR 90% OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP. IN EACH CASE, THE DEDUCTIBLE PERCENTAGE IS APPLIED TO THE INSURERS SUBJECT DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS FROM THE CALENDAR YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE

APPLICABLE YEAR. THE DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM WAS 7% FOR 2003, 10% FOR 2004 AND IS 15% FOR 2005. THE PROGRAM ALSO CONTAINS AN ANNUAL CAP THAT LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE

SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE $100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE U.S. TREASURY AND AN INSURER THAT HAS MET ITS DEDUCTIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM YEAR IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES (OR PORTION

THEREOF) THAT EXCEED THE $100 BILLION CAP. THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM IS $2.51 BILLION FOR 2005. THE COMPANY HAD NO TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES IN 2004 OR 2003. IF THE PROGRAM IS NOT RENEWED FOR PERIODS AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2006, THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM SUBJECT ONLY TO THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE POLICIES.

FLORIDA REINSURANCE FUND

THE COMPANY ALSO PARTICIPATES IN THE FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND

(FHCF), WHICH IS A STATE-MANDATED CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE FUND THAT WILL PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT TO INSURERS FOR A PORTION OF THEIR FUTURE CATASTROPHIC HURRICANE LOSSES. FHCF IS PRIMARILY FUNDED BY PREMIUMS FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WRITE

RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY BUSINESS IN FLORIDA AND, IF INSUFFICIENT, ASSESSMENTS ON INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WRITE OTHER PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE, EXCLUDING WORKERS COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL MALPRACTICE. FHCFS RESOURCES ARE LIMITED TO

THESE CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO ITS BORROWING CAPACITY AT THE TIME OF A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE IN FLORIDA. IN 2004, FHCF PAID ITS OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM THE FOUR HURRICANES THAT MADE LANDFALL IN FLORIDA FROM THE CASH ON HAND DERIVED FROM PREMIUM

PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FHCF RESOURCES WILL BE AT THE STATUTORY REQUIRED CAPACITY IN 2005. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF FHCF.

THE COMPANYS RECOVERY OF LESS THAN CONTRACTED AMOUNTS FROM FHCF COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE EVENT OF A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE IN FLORIDA. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ITS RECOVERY OF LESS THAN CONTRACTED AMOUNTS FROM FHCF WOULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

RESERVES

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED.

MANAGEMENT CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS THAT INCLUDES REVIEW OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS, UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND

HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, THE COMPANY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FOR REINSURANCE,

SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION. THE RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED REGULARLY BY A QUALIFIED ACTUARY EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING RESERVES AND A DISCUSSION OF UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND RISK FACTORS, SEE

ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES.

THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND REQUIRES THE CONSIDERATION OF A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES

(DISCUSSED BY PRODUCT LINE IN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION) ARE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, INFLATION, JUDICIAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE

CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS OF LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE UNDERLYING

INSURANCE CONTRACT (E.G., CLAIMS MADE VERSUS OCCURRENCE), CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, DETERMINING THE OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM, AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE

INSURED EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES FOR UNREPORTED CLAIMS AND DEVELOPMENT ON REPORTED CLAIMS PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF LOSS

DEVELOPMENT BY ACCIDENT YEAR FOR EACH TYPE OF EXPOSURE AND MARKET SEGMENT. SIMILARLY, THE COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES OF UNPAID LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO LOSSES FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AND TYPE OF EXPOSURE. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANYS RESERVING METHODS FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE ITEM 7ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION, AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

DISCOUNTING

INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ARE CERTAIN RESERVES DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE LIABILITIES FOR LOSSES FOR SOME LONG-TERM DISABILITY PAYMENTS UNDER WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND

WORKERS COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE, WHICH TOTALED $2.06 BILLION AND $1.33 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED USING RATES OF 3.5% TO 5.0%. RESERVES RELATED TO CERTAIN FIXED AND DETERMINABLE

ASBESTOS-RELATED SETTLEMENTS, WHERE ALL PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND THEIR TIMING ARE KNOWN, WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RANGE OF INTEREST RATES FROM 2.3% TO 5.5% AND TOTALED $48 MILLION AND $445 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. RESERVES FOR

CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE COVERAGE ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, DISCOUNTED USING RATES OF 5.0% TO 7.5%, WERE $116 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

OTHER FACTORS

THE TABLE ON PAGE 22 SETS FORTH THE YEAR-END RESERVES FROM 1994 THROUGH 2004 AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THOSE RESERVES, PRESENTED ON A HISTORICAL

BASIS. THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND REESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR THE YEARS 1994 THROUGH 2003 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE ACQUISITION OF SPC IN 2004. THE TABLE INCLUDES SPC RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND

REESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR THE YEARS 1994 TO 2001 AND 1994 TO 1995 HAVE ALSO NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE ACQUISITION OF NORTHLAND AND COMMERCIAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

GUARANTY CASUALTY AND OF AETNAS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, RESPECTIVELY. BEGINNING IN 1996 AND 2002, THE TABLE INCLUDES THE RESERVE

ACTIVITY OF AETNAS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, AND NORTHLAND AND COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY, RESPECTIVELY. THE DATA IN THE TABLE IS PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC). CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO AVOID MISINTERPRETATION BY THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS INFORMATION OR FAMILIAR WITH OTHER DATA COMMONLY REPORTED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE ACCOMPANYING DATA IS NOT ACCIDENT YEAR DATA, BUT RATHER A DISPLAY

OF 1994 TO 2004 YEAR-END RESERVES AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THOSE RESERVES.

FOR INSTANCE, THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY OR REDUNDANCY SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE FOR EACH YEAR REPRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT BY WHICH ORIGINAL ESTIMATES OF RESERVES AS OF THAT YEAR END HAVE CHANGED

IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. ACCORDINGLY, THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY FOR A YEAR RELATES ONLY TO RESERVES AT THAT YEAR-END AND THOSE AMOUNTS ARE NOT ADDITIVE. EXPRESSED ANOTHER WAY, IF THE ORIGINAL RESERVES AT THE END OF 1994 INCLUDED $4 MILLION FOR A LOSS

THAT IS FINALLY PAID IN 2004 FOR $5 MILLION, THE $1 MILLION DEFICIENCY (THE EXCESS OF THE ACTUAL PAYMENT OF $5 MILLION OVER THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF $4 MILLION) WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES IN EACH OF THE YEARS 1994 TO 2003 SHOWN

IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

VARIOUS FACTORS MAY DISTORT THE

RE-ESTIMATED RESERVES AND CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY OR REDUNDANCY SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE ARISE FROM CLAIMS ON POLICIES WRITTEN PRIOR TO THE

MID-1970S INVOLVING LIABILITY EXPOSURES SUCH AS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN THE POST-1984 PERIOD, THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED MORE STRINGENT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND POLICY EXCLUSIONS AND HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRACTED OR TERMINATED THE

WRITING OF THESE RISKS. SEE ITEM 7ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE LIABILITIES IN THE PAST WILL NOT

NECESSARILY RECUR IN THE FUTURE.

OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE

DATA IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE INCLUDE THE DISCOUNTING OF CERTAIN RESERVES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, AND THE USE OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED INSURANCE POLICIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WORKERS COMPENSATION INDEMNITY RESERVES (TABULAR RESERVES) ARE DISCOUNTED TO

REFLECT THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. APPARENT DEFICIENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AS THE DISCOUNT ON THESE WORKERS COMPENSATION RESERVES IS ACCRETED AT THE APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATES. ALSO, A PORTION OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN

WITH RETROSPECTIVELY RATED INSURANCE POLICIES IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE LOSS EXPERIENCE IS PRIMARILY BORNE BY THE INSURED. FOR THIS BUSINESS, INCREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING INCREASE IN AMOUNTS

RECOVERABLE FROM INSUREDS. LIKEWISE, DECREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN A DECREASE IN RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING DECREASE IN AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM THESE INSUREDS. THE AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON THESE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES MITIGATE THE

IMPACT OF THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES OR REDUNDANCIES ON THE COMPANYS EARNINGS BUT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

BECAUSE OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL EXTRAPOLATION OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REDUNDANCIES OR DEFICIENCIES IN LOSS

RESERVES FROM THE DATA IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

THE

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RESERVES FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE, WHICH IS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THOSE REPORTED IN THE

COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORTS FILED WITH INSURANCE REGULATORS, WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES, WERE $(282) MILLION, $26 MILLION AND $(12) MILLION FOR 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN THE

DIFFERENCE FROM 2003 TO 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF A REINSURANCE CONTRACT WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO IN 2004 THAT PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS ARE SEGREGATED FROM OTHER CLAIMS AND ARE HANDLED SEPARATELY BY THE COMPANYS SPECIAL

LIABILITY GROUP, A SEPARATE UNIT STAFFED BY DEDICATED LEGAL, CLAIM, FINANCE AND ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INTERCOMPANY REINSURANCE

MOST OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

MEMBERS OF INTERCOMPANY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS. POOLING ARRANGEMENTS PERMIT THE PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO RELY ON THE CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE POOLS CAPITAL AND SURPLUS RATHER THAN JUST ON ITS OWN CAPITAL AND

SURPLUS. UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, THE MEMBERS SHARE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INSURANCE BUSINESS THAT IS WRITTEN, AND ALLOCATE THE COMBINED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THERE WERE THREE INTERCOMPANY POOLING ARRANGEMENTS: THE

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY POOL, THE ST. PAUL INSURANCE GROUP POOL, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, AND THE NORTHLAND POOL. POOLS PERMIT THE PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO RELY ON THE CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE POOLS CAPITAL AND SURPLUS RATHER THAN

JUST ON ITS OWN CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY OF AMERICA (TRAVELERS C&S OF AMERICA), WHICH IS DEDICATED TO THE BOND BUSINESS, DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY OF THE POOLS. THE PERSONAL SINGLE STATE COMPANIES AND

COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY (SEE RATINGS BELOW) ARE ALSO NOT INCLUDED IN ANY OF THE POOLS. IN 2004, THE FORMER GULF INTERCOMPANY POOLING ARRANGEMENT WAS AMENDED, THEREBY ELIMINATING GULF INSURANCE COMPANYS RETROCESSION TO

THE OTHER FORMER POOL PARTICIPANTS.

RATINGS

RATINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SETTING THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE

POSITION IN THE INSURANCE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY RECEIVES RATINGS FROM THE FOLLOWING MAJOR RATING AGENCIES: A.M. BEST COMPANY (A.M. BEST), FITCH RATINGS (FITCH), MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODYS) AND STANDARD & POORS CORP.

(S&P). RATING AGENCIES TYPICALLY ISSUE TWO TYPES OF RATINGS: CLAIMS-PAYING (OR FINANCIAL STRENGTH) RATINGS WHICH ASSESS AN INSURERS ABILITY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND DEBT RATINGS WHICH ASSESS A COMPANYS

PROSPECTS FOR REPAYING ITS DEBTS AND ASSIST LENDERS IN SETTING INTEREST RATES AND TERMS FOR A COMPANYS SHORT AND LONG TERM BORROWING NEEDS. THE SYSTEM AND THE NUMBER OF RATING CATEGORIES CAN VARY WIDELY FROM RATING AGENCY TO RATING AGENCY.

CUSTOMERS USUALLY FOCUS ON CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS, WHILE CREDITORS FOCUS ON DEBT RATINGS. INVESTORS USE BOTH TO EVALUATE A COMPANYS OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH. THE RATINGS ISSUED ON THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES BY ANY OF THESE AGENCIES ARE

ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY AND ARE AVAILABLE ON THE COMPANYS WEBSITE AND FROM THE AGENCIES.

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, THERE COULD BE A REDUCED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN

PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD BE IMPACTED AND HIGHER BORROWING COSTS MAY BE INCURRED.

IN JANUARY 2004, A.M. BEST PLACED THE A FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATING OF GULF, A THEN MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

THE COMPANY, UNDER REVIEW WITH DEVELOPING IMPLICATIONS, AND S&P INDICATED THAT ITS A+ COUNTERPARTY CREDIT AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS ON MEMBERS OF THE GULF INSURANCE GROUP ARE REMAINING ON CREDITWATCH WITH NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS, PENDING THE

COMPLETION OF A SUPPORT ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY AND GULF.

INVESTMENTS

INSURANCE

COMPANY INVESTMENTS MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH PRESCRIBE THE KIND, QUALITY AND CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS. IN GENERAL, THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERMIT INVESTMENTS IN FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS, CORPORATE

BONDS, PREFERRED AND COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES, MORTGAGE LOANS, REAL ESTATE AND CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENTS, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED LIMITS AND CERTAIN OTHER QUALIFICATIONS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS $64.71 BILLION, OF WHICH 92% WAS

INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS (OF WHICH 55% WAS INVESTED IN FEDERAL, STATE OR MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS), 1% IN MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE, 1% IN COMMON STOCKS AND OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES AND 6% IN

OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE AVERAGE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WAS 4.1 YEARS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. NON-INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.78 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004.

COMPETITION

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE IN THE AREAS OF PRICE, SERVICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AGENT RELATIONSHIPS AND METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION, I.E., USE OF INDEPENDENT AGENTS, EXCLUSIVE AGENTS AND/OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES. ACCORDING TO A.M. BEST, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 950 PROPERTY

CASUALTY ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 2,400 PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES. OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS, THE TOP 150 ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 92% OF THE CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRYS TOTAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2003.

SEVERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LARGE DEDUCTIBLE

PROGRAMS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE THAT UTILIZE CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS, HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED IN REACTION TO THE ESCALATING COST OF INSURANCE CAUSED IN PART BY INCREASED COSTS FROM WORKERS COMPENSATION

CASES AND JURY AWARDS IN THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY CASES.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

COMMERCIAL.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS REPRESENTED IN THE COMMERCIAL LINES MARKETPLACE BY MANY

INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZE AS WELL AS OTHER ENTITIES OFFERING RISK ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS OR CAPTIVE PROGRAMS. MARKET COMPETITION WORKS WITHIN THE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO SET THE PRICE CHARGED FOR INSURANCE

PRODUCTS AND THE LEVEL OF SERVICE PROVIDED. GROWTH IS DRIVEN BY A COMPANYS ABILITY TO PROVIDE INSURANCE AND SERVICES AT A PRICE THAT IS REASONABLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, THE MARKETPLACE IS AFFECTED BY AVAILABLE CAPACITY

OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AS MEASURED BY POLICYHOLDERS SURPLUS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE. SURPLUS EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS PRIMARILY IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROFIT LEVELS GENERATED BY THE INDUSTRY. GROWTH IN PREMIUM AND SERVICE BUSINESS IS

ALSO MEASURED BY A COMPANYS ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, MANY LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS SELF-INSURE THEIR RISKS OR UTILIZE LARGE DEDUCTIBLES ON PURCHASED INSURANCE.

COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN WRITTEN THROUGH

INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, ALTHOUGH SOME COMPANIES USE DIRECT WRITING. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES WILLING TO WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND PRICING AND,

TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMPANIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED NICHE PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. COMPANIES COMPETE ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, RESPONSE TIME IN POLICY ISSUANCE AND CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES.

ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVED EFFICIENCY THROUGH AUTOMATION AND RESPONSE TIME TO CUSTOMER NEEDS ARE KEY TO SUCCESS IN THIS MARKET. THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT ALSO UTILIZES DEDICATED UNITS TO TAILOR INSURANCE PROGRAMS TO UNIQUE INSURANCE NEEDS. THESE UNITS ARE

NATIONAL PROPERTY, TRANSPORTATION, BOILER AND MACHINERY, INLAND MARINE, AGRIBUSINESS, EXCESS AND SURPLUS AND NATIONAL PROGRAMS.

SELECT ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY WRITTEN THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS. BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROPERTY

CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE IN THE SELECT ACCOUNTS MARKET WHICH GENERALLY COMPRISES LOWER HAZARD, MAIN STREET BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. RISKS ARE UNDERWRITTEN AND PRICED USING STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND A COMBINATION OF

PROPRIETARY AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRODUCT OFFERINGS. COMPETITION IN THIS MARKET IS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND RESPONSE TIME IN POLICY SERVICES. THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT HAS ESTABLISHED A STRONG MARKETING RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND HAS PROVIDED IT WITH DEFINED UNDERWRITING POLICIES, A BROAD ARRAY OF PRODUCTS, COMPETITIVE PRICES AND ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT AUTOMATED ENVIRONMENTS IN THE INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED CENTRALIZED

SERVICE CENTERS TO HELP AGENTS PERFORM MANY SERVICE FUNCTIONS, IN RETURN FOR A FEE. COMMERCIALS OVERALL SERVICE PLATFORM IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST IN THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMERCIAL MARKET.

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY WRITTEN THROUGH NATIONAL BROKERS AND,

TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS. INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE IN THIS MARKET BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES, MANAGED CARE COST CONTAINMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS ALSO

OFFERS A LARGE NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCALIZED CLAIM SERVICE CENTERS WHICH PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN CLAIMS ADJUSTING AND ALLOWS COMMERCIAL TO MORE QUICKLY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. COMMERCIALS RESIDUAL MARKET BUSINESS ALSO

COMPETES FOR STATE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES. THESE CONTRACTS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE THREE-YEAR TERMS, ARE SELECTED BY STATE AGENCIES THROUGH A BID PROCESS BASED ON THE QUALITY OF SERVICE AND PRICE. COMMERCIAL

SERVICES APPROXIMATELY 35% OF THE TOTAL WORKERS COMPENSATION ASSIGNED RISK MARKET, MAKING THE COMPANY ONE OF THE LARGEST SERVICING INSURERS IN THE INDUSTRY.

THE MARKET IN WHICH GULF COMPETED INCLUDED SMALL TO MID-SIZE NICHE COMPANIES THAT TARGET SPECIFIC LINES OF INSURANCE AND

LARGER, MULTI-LINE COMPANIES THAT FOCUS ON VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF THE SPECIALTY ACCOUNTS MARKET. PRIOR TO BEING PLACED IN RUNOFF IN 2004, GULFS BUSINESS WAS GENERALLY WRITTEN THROUGH RETAIL AND WHOLESALE AGENTS AND BROKERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

STATES.

THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT OPERATES IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY FOR THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT. THE COMPANYS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE WITH OTHER STOCK COMPANIES, MUTUAL COMPANIES,

ALTERNATIVE RISK SHARING GROUPS AND OTHER UNDERWRITING ORGANIZATIONS. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE COMPANIES WILLING TO WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND PRICING AND, TO A

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMPANIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED NICHE PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, MANY LARGE

COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS SELF-INSURE THEIR RISKS OR UTILIZE LARGE DEDUCTIBLES ON PURCHASED INSURANCE.

BOND UNDERWRITES AND MARKETS ITS PRODUCTS TO NATIONAL, MID-SIZED AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS, AND DISTRIBUTES THEM

THROUGH BOTH NATIONAL AND WHOLESALE BROKERS, AND RETAIL AGENTS AND REGIONAL BROKERS. BOND COMPETES IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SURETY AND EXECUTIVE LIABILITY MARKETPLACES. BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE WITH

BOND. BONDS REPUTATION FOR TIMELY AND CONSISTENT DECISION-MAKING, A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCAL UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS AND INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND STRONG PRODUCER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL AS ITS ABILITY TO OFFER ITS CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE

OF PRODUCTS, ENABLE IT TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY. BONDS ABILITY TO CROSS-SELL ITS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS OF THE COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL SEGMENTS PROVIDES FURTHER COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES FOR THE COMPANY.

CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN WRITTEN THROUGH INDEPENDENT

AGENTS AND BROKERS. COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY INCLUDE BOTH NATIONAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES. COMPANIES COMPETE ON PRICE, COVERAGE OFFERINGS, CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES, MANAGED CARE COST

CONTAINMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CONSTRUCTION OFFERS A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCALIZED, DEDICATED CLAIM SERVICE PROFESSIONALS THAT PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN CLAIMS ADJUSTING AND ALLOWS CONSTRUCTION TO MORE QUICKLY RESPOND TO

THE NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, DEDICATED RISK CONTROL PROFESSIONALS WORK DIRECTLY WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE EVALUATION, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SAFETY PROGRAMS TO BETTER CONTROL RISK AND EXPOSURE TO LOSS.

FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY WRITTEN THROUGH

NATIONAL BROKERS, REGIONAL BROKERS, AND INDEPENDENT AGENTS. INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE ON PRICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS. THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED A STRONG REPUTATION IN THIS COMPLEX, DYNAMIC MARKET SEGMENT AND HAS AN ADVANTAGE OVER MANY OF ITS

COMPETITORS IN OFFERING A WIDE BREADTH OF PROFESSIONAL AND GENERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COVERAGES TO ITS FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS.

THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER DOMESTIC BUSINESS GROUPS IN SPECIALTY THAT COMPETE IN FOCUSED TARGET MARKETS. EACH OF THESE MARKETS ARE DIFFERENT AND REQUIRE

UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE, PROPRIETARY COVERAGE FORMS, SPECIALIZED RISK CONTROL AND LOSS HANDLING SERVICES, AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENTS AND BROKERS THAT ALSO FOCUS ON THESE MARKETS. IN SOME CASES THE COMPETITION IS NATIONAL CARRIERS

WITH SIMILARLY DEDICATED UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING GROUPS. IN OTHER CASES SMALLER REGIONAL COMPANIES TEND TO BE THE PRIMARY COMPETITION. IN EITHER CASE THESE BUSINESSES HAVE REGIONAL STRUCTURES THAT ALLOW THEM TO DELIVER PERSONALIZED SERVICE AND

LOCAL KNOWLEDGE TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. SPECIALIZED AGENTS AND BROKERS SUPPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY. IN ALL OF THESE BUSINESSES, THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY IS MARKET LEADERSHIP ATTAINED THROUGH FOCUSED INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE APPLIED TO INSURANCE AND RISK

NEEDS.

INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS

INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL COUNTRY INSURERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. COMPANIES COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE LEVEL OF CLAIM AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROVIDED. SPECIALTY HAS DEVELOPED

EXPERTISE IN VARIOUS SPECIALTY MARKETS IN THESE COUNTRIES SIMILAR TO THOSE SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDES BOTH PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COVERAGE FOR THESE MARKETS. THIS SPECIALTY FOCUS IS A PARTICULAR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THESE COUNTRIES

WHERE OUR COMPETITORS TEND TO BE MORE PRODUCT OR LINE OF BUSINESS ORIENTED. PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER OF LOCAL COUNTRY BROKERS AND AGENTS WHOSE CUSTOMER GROUPS ALIGN WITH THE COMPANYS SPECIALTY MARKETS.

AT LLOYDS, INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY COMPETES WITH OTHER

SYNDICATES OPERATING IN THE LLOYDS MARKET AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC INSURERS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS WHERE INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY WRITES BUSINESS WORLDWIDE. SYNDICATES ARE INCREASINGLY CAPITALIZED BY CORPORATE CAPITAL, MUCH OF

WHICH IS PROVIDED BY LARGE INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE ENTERPRISES. COMPETITION IS AGAIN BASED ON PRICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS. INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY HAS AN EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON LINES IT BELIEVES IT CAN UNDERWRITE EFFECTIVELY AND PROFITABLY WITH AN

EMPHASIS ON SHORT-TAIL INSURANCE (VERSUS REINSURANCE) LINES. SPECIALTY UNDERWRITES FOUR MAJOR CLASSES OF BUSINESS AT LLOYDS: MARINE, PERSONAL, PROPERTY AND AVIATION.

PERSONAL.

PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE IS WRITTEN BY HUNDREDS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZES.

ALTHOUGH NATIONAL COMPANIES WRITE THE MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESS, PERSONAL ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM LOCAL OR REGIONAL COMPANIES WHICH OFTEN HAVE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCAL MARKETPLACE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH

LOCAL AGENTS. PERSONAL BELIEVES THAT THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS ARE PRICE, SERVICE, PERCEIVED STABILITY OF THE INSURER AND NAME RECOGNITION. PERSONAL COMPETES FOR BUSINESS WITHIN EACH INDEPENDENT AGENCY SINCE THESE AGENCIES ALSO OFFER

POLICIES OF COMPETING COMPANIES. AT THE AGENCY LEVEL, COMPETITION IS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRICE AND THE LEVEL OF SERVICE, INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF AUTOMATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIVIDUAL

AGENTS. PERSONAL ALSO COMPETES WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT USE EXCLUSIVE AGENTS OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO ITS TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENT AGENCY DISTRIBUTION, PERSONAL HAS BROADENED ITS DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS BY

MARKETING TO SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE AND AFFINITY GROUPS, AND THROUGH JOINT MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER INSURERS. PERSONAL BELIEVES THAT ITS CONTINUED FOCUS ON EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, UNDERWRITING AND PRICING

SEGMENTATION, AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT EFFECTIVENESS STRATEGIES ENABLE PERSONAL TO PRICE ITS PRODUCTS COMPETITIVELY IN ALL OF ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

ASSET MANAGEMENT.

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN ALL ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES THAT

DISTRIBUTE NUVEEN INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ALSO DISTRIBUTE NUMEROUS COMPETING PRODUCTS, OFTEN INCLUDING PRODUCTS SPONSORED BY THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION FIRMS WHERE THEY ARE EMPLOYED. THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR NEW

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS MANAGED ACCOUNT BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM OTHER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS SEEKING TO BE APPROVED AS MANAGERS IN THE VARIOUS WRAP-FEE PROGRAMS. THE

SPONSOR FIRMS HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF APPROVED MANAGERS AT THE HIGHEST AND MOST ATTRACTIVE LEVELS OF THEIR PROGRAMS AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ASPECTS OF SUCH FIRMS ON AN ON-GOING BASIS AS THEY EVALUATE

WHICH FIRMS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO COMPETITION IN OBTAINING THE COMMITMENT OF UNDERWRITERS TO UNDERWRITE ITS EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND OFFERINGS. TO THE EXTENT THE INCREASED

COMPETITION FOR UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION CAUSES HIGHER DISTRIBUTION COSTS, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET REVENUE AND EARNINGS WILL BE REDUCED.

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC BY BROKER/DEALERS, BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHERS, AND MANY COMPETING INVESTMENT PRODUCT SPONSORS OFFER

A BROADER ARRAY OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS. MANY OF THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER RESOURCES THAN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS ALTERING THE LANDSCAPE IN WHICH NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS DISTRIBUTORS COMPETE. THE EFFECT THAT CONTINUING CHANGE IN THE BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRIES WILL HAVE ON NUVEEN INVESTMENTS AND ITS COMPETITORS CANNOT BE PREDICTED. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS COMPETES WITH OTHER PROVIDERS

OF PRODUCTS PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS OFFERED, THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF SUCH PRODUCTS, QUALITY OF SERVICE, FEES CHARGED, THE LEVEL AND TYPE OF BROKER COMPENSATION, THE MANNER IN WHICH SUCH PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED AND

DISTRIBUTED, AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES AND INVESTORS.

REGULATION

STATE REGULATION

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE

VARIOUS STATES AND JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY TRANSACT BUSINESS. THE EXTENT OF REGULATION VARIES, BUT GENERALLY DERIVES FROM STATUTES THAT DELEGATE REGULATORY, SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO A DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN EACH STATE. THE

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION RELATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED, THE LICENSING OF INSURERS AND THEIR AGENTS, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS, PREMIUM RATES, RESTRICTIONS ON

THE SIZE OF RISKS THAT MAY BE INSURED UNDER A SINGLE POLICY, RESERVES AND PROVISIONS FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS, DEPOSITS OF SECURITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF POLICYHOLDERS, APPROVAL OF POLICY FORMS AND THE REGULATION OF MARKET

CONDUCT, INCLUDING THE USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION IN UNDERWRITING AS WELL AS OTHER UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, MANY STATES HAVE ENACTED VARIATIONS OF COMPETITIVE

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RATE-MAKING LAWS, WHICH ALLOW INSURERS TO SET CERTAIN PREMIUM RATES FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF INSURANCE WITHOUT HAVING TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE STATE

INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS ALSO CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE AFFAIRS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND REQUIRE THE FILING OF ANNUAL AND OTHER REPORTS RELATING TO THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF COMPANIES AND OTHER MATTERS. AT THE

PRESENT TIME, THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE COLLECTIVELY LICENSED TO TRANSACT INSURANCE BUSINESS IN ALL STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, GUAM, PUERTO RICO, BERMUDA, AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS, AS WELL AS AUSTRALIA, CANADA, NEW

ZEALAND, THE PHILIPPINES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, SOUTH AFRICA AND CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.

AS PART OF ONGOING, INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS, THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM SEVERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING 14

STATES AND THE SEC. THE AREAS OF INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS, THE COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT WITH NON-TRADITIONAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS, LAWYER LIABILITY INSURANCE AND

BRANDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SALVAGE AUTOMOBILES. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING FULLY WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, THE COMPANY IS NOT REGULATED AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. HOWEVER, AS THE COMPANY OWNS CAPITAL STOCK IN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, IT IS

SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER LAWS, OF EACH OF THE STATES OF DOMICILE OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. ALL HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS OTHER LAWS, REQUIRE DISCLOSURE AND, IN SOME

INSTANCES, PRIOR APPROVAL OF MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND AN AFFILIATE. THE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES AS WELL AS OTHER LAWS ALSO REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PRIOR APPROVAL OF AN ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF A DOMESTIC INSURER,

SOME TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AFFILIATES AND THE PAYMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS.

INSURANCE REGULATION CONCERNING DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT AND MINNESOTA. THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF BOTH STATES APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRE

NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND, THAT TOGETHER WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURERS SURPLUS AS

OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURERS NET INCOME FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. (IN THE CASE OF MINNESOTA, NET INCOME EXCLUDES

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS FOR PURPOSES OF THE CALCULATION OF THE 10% THRESHOLD.) THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.

THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE RESTRICTIVE, LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

ASSESSMENTS FOR GUARANTY FUNDS AND SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

VIRTUALLY ALL STATES REQUIRE INSURERS LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS IN THEIR STATE

TO BEAR A PORTION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED BY SOME INSUREDS AS A RESULT OF THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURERS. DEPENDING UPON STATE LAW, INSURERS CAN BE ASSESSED AN AMOUNT THAT IS GENERALLY EQUAL TO BETWEEN 1% AND 2% OF PREMIUMS WRITTEN FOR THE RELEVANT

LINES OF INSURANCE IN THAT STATE EACH YEAR TO PAY THE CLAIMS OF AN INSOLVENT INSURER. PART OF THESE PAYMENTS IS RECOVERABLE THROUGH PREMIUM RATES, PREMIUM TAX CREDITS OR POLICY SURCHARGES. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ASSESSMENTS COULD LIMIT THE ABILITY

OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO RECOVER SUCH ASSESSMENTS THROUGH TAX CREDITS OR OTHER MEANS. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO LIMIT OR REPEAL THE TAX OFFSET PROVISIONS, WHICH EFFORTS, TO DATE, HAVE BEEN

GENERALLY UNSUCCESSFUL. THESE ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF RECENT INSOLVENCIES.

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANY STATES HAVE LAWS THAT ESTABLISHED SECOND-INJURY FUNDS TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO INJURED EMPLOYEES

FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRIOR CONDITION OR INJURY. INSURERS WRITING WORKERS COMPENSATION IN THOSE STATES HAVING SECOND-INJURY FUNDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS CREATING THE FUNDS, INCLUDING THE VARIOUS FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT THOSE STATES HAVE

ADOPTED TO FUND THE SECOND-INJURY FUNDS. SEVERAL OF THE STATES HAVING LARGER SECOND-INJURY FUNDS UTILIZE A PREMIUM SURCHARGE THAT EFFECTIVELY PASSES THE COST OF THE FUND TO POLICYHOLDERS. OTHER STATES ASSESS THE INSURER BASED ON PAID LOSSES AND

ALLOW THE INSURER TO RECOUP THE ASSESSMENT THROUGH FUTURE PREMIUM RATES.

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNED RISK POOLS, PRINCIPALLY INVOLVING WORKERS COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, WHICH PROVIDE VARIOUS

INSURANCE COVERAGES TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE THAT COVERAGE IN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. PARTICIPATION IN THESE POOLS IN MOST STATES IS GENERALLY IN PROPORTION TO VOLUNTARY WRITINGS OF RELATED LINES OF

BUSINESS IN THAT STATE. IN THE EVENT THAT A MEMBER OF THAT POOL BECOMES INSOLVENT, THE REMAINING MEMBERS ASSUME AN ADDITIONAL PRO RATA SHARE OF THE LIABILITIES OF THE POOL. THE UNDERWRITING RESULTS OF THESE POOLS TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN

UNPROFITABLE. COMBINED EARNED PREMIUMS RELATED TO SUCH POOLS AND ASSIGNED RISKS FOR THE COMPANY WERE $168 MILLION, $160 MILLION AND $148 MILLION IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE RELATED COMBINED UNDERWRITING LOSSES FOR THE COMPANY WERE $71

MILLION, $111 MILLION AND $39 MILLION IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY CHANGES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE STATES FROM TIME TO TIME THAT WOULD MODIFY SOME OF THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE USE OF

INFORMATION. THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THAT LEGISLATION ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES CANNOT BE PREDICTED AT THIS TIME.

INSURANCE REGULATIONS CONCERNING CHANGE OF CONTROL

MANY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY LAWS INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR THE PROTECTION OF POLICYHOLDERS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE ADVANCE APPROVAL BY STATE

AGENCIES OF ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT IS DOMICILED, OR, IN SOME CASES, HAVING SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS THAT IT IS DEEMED TO BE COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED, IN THAT STATE. THE COMPANY OWNS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ALL OF THE SHARES OF

STOCK OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES DOMICILED IN THE STATES OF ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE, FLORIDA, ILLINOIS, INDIANA, IOWA, MARYLAND, MASSACHUSETTS, MINNESOTA, MISSISSIPPI, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, TEXAS AND WISCONSIN.

CONTROL IS GENERALLY PRESUMED TO EXIST THROUGH THE OWNERSHIP OF 10% (5% IN THE CASE OF FLORIDA) OR MORE OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF A DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY OR OF ANY COMPANY THAT CONTROLS A DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY. ANY PURCHASER

OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTING 10% (5% IN THE CASE OF FLORIDA) OR MORE OF THE VOTING POWER OF THE COMPANYS CAPITAL STOCK WILL BE PRESUMED TO HAVE ACQUIRED CONTROL OF THE COMPANYS DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS, FOLLOWING

APPLICATION BY THAT PURCHASER IN EACH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARYS STATE OF DOMICILE, THE RELEVANT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DETERMINES OTHERWISE.

IN ADDITION TO THESE FILINGS, THE LAWS OF MANY STATES CONTAIN PROVISIONS REQUIRING PRE-NOTIFICATION TO STATE AGENCIES PRIOR TO ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF A

NON-DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY ADMITTED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN THAT STATE. WHILE THESE PRE-NOTIFICATION STATUTES DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE STATE AGENCY TO DISAPPROVE THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, THEY DO AUTHORIZE ISSUANCE OF CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS WITH

RESPECT TO THE NON-DOMESTIC INSURER IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT SOME CONDITIONS, SUCH AS UNDUE MARKET CONCENTRATION, WOULD RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION.

ANY TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF ANY OF THE COMPANYS INSURER SUBSIDIARIES WOULD GENERALLY REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE

INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED OR COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED AND MAY REQUIRE PREACQUISITION NOTIFICATION IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED PREACQUISITION NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS AND

IN WHICH SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ADMITTED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS.

ONE OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS ARE DOMICILED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. INSURERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES AND MARKETS ACT OF 2000 INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. INSURERS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE

IRISH FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATORY AUTHORITY.

SOME OF THE

COMPANYS OTHER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN, OR AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT INSURANCE BUSINESS IN, CANADA. AUTHORIZED INSURERS IN CANADA ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 407 OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT,

INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY DETER, DELAY OR PREVENT TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING THE CONTROL OF OR THE OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS.

INSURANCE REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) INSURANCE

REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM (IRIS) WAS DEVELOPED TO HELP STATE REGULATORS IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION. THE IRIS SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A STATISTICAL PHASE AND AN ANALYTICAL PHASE WHEREBY FINANCIAL EXAMINERS REVIEW ANNUAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL RATIOS. THE STATISTICAL PHASE CONSISTS OF TWELVE KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS BASED ON YEAR-END DATA THAT ARE GENERATED FROM THE NAIC DATABASE ANNUALLY, AND EACH RATIO HAS AN ESTABLISHED USUAL RANGE OF RESULTS. THESE

RATIOS ASSIST STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS IN EXECUTING THEIR STATUTORY MANDATE TO OVERSEE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES.

A RATIO RESULT FALLING OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE OF IRIS RATIOS IS NOT CONSIDERED A FAILING RESULT; RATHER, UNUSUAL VALUES ARE VIEWED AS PART OF THE

REGULATORY EARLY MONITORING SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, IN SOME YEARS, IT MAY NOT BE UNUSUAL FOR FINANCIALLY SOUND COMPANIES TO HAVE SEVERAL RATIOS WITH RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES. GENERALLY, AN INSURANCE COMPANY WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO REGULATORY

SCRUTINY IF IT FALLS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES OF FOUR OR MORE OF THE RATIOS. AS PUBLISHED BY THE NAIC, APPROXIMATELY 18.5% OF THE COMPANIES INCLUDED IN THE IRIS SYSTEM HAVE REPORTED RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE ON FOUR OR MORE RATIOS IN 2002.

IN 2004, MOST OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN

THE TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY POOL HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE FOR THE ESTIMATED CURRENT RESERVE DEFICIENCY TO SURPLUS RATIO, WITH RATIOS RANGING FROM 26% TO 37% ABOVE THE USUAL 25% OR LOWER, DUE TO THE LAGS IN THE RATIOS ABILITY TO

REFLECT CHANGES IN BUSINESS VOLUME AND BUSINESS MIX. ALSO IN 2004, THE GULF INSURANCE COMPANY, ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY, UNITED STATES FIDELITY AND GUARANTY COMPANY, DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY AND MOST OF THE ST. PAUL FIRE AND

MARINE POOL MEMBERS HAD UNUSUAL VALUES IN THE ONE-YEAR AND TWO-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RATIOS ABOVE THE USUAL VALUES OF 20% OR LOWER, DUE TO RESERVE STRENGTHENING ACTIONS THAT OCCURRED IN 2003 AND 2004. THOSE ONE-YEAR AND TWO-YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT RATIOS FOR GULF INSURANCE COMPANY WERE 44% AND 126%, FOR ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY THE RATIOS WERE 24% AND 40%, FOR UNITED STATES FIDELITY AND GUARANTY COMPANY THE RATIOS WERE 78% AND 29%, AND FOR DISCOVER REINSURANCE

COMPANY THE RATIOS WERE 64% AND 151%. THE ONE-YEAR AND TWO-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RATIOS FOR THE ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE POOL MEMBERS WITH UNUSUAL VALUES RANGED FROM 22% TO 45% AND 40% TO 93% RESPECTIVELY. UNITED STATES FIDELITY AND GUARANTY

COMPANY, DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY AND GULF INSURANCE COMPANY HAD TWO-YEAR OPERATING RATIOS OF 159%, 108% AND 149%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE USUAL MAXIMUM OF 100%, DUE TO THE 2004 RESERVE STRENGTHENING ACTIONS. UNITED STATES FIDELITY AND

GUARANTY COMPANY AND DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY ALSO HAD CHANGE IN SURPLUS RATIOS OF 63% AND 78%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO A USUAL MAXIMUM OF 50%, DUE TO 2004 CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY ALSO

HAD A SURPLUS AID TO SURPLUS RATIO OF 17% COMPARED TO THE USUAL MAXIMUM OF 15%. SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING GULF INSURANCE COMPANY, HAD INVESTMENT YIELD RATIOS BELOW THE USUAL MINIMUM RATIO OF 4.5% DUE TO LOWER

YIELDS ON NEWER INVESTMENTS. THIS WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THOSE COMPANIES WITH PREDOMINATELY SHORTER TERM INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES.

IN 2003, MOST OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN THE TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY POOL HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE FOR THE TWO-YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TO SURPLUS RATIO AND THE ESTIMATED CURRENT RESERVE DEFICIENCY TO SURPLUS RATIO RANGING FROM 22% TO 51%, WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL RANGE OF 20% TO 25% OR LOWER, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE PRETAX STATUTORY INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES FOR

ADDITIONS TO ASBESTOS RESERVES IN 2002. IN

ADDITION, ONE OF THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL INSURANCE COMPANIES HAD ONE OTHER RATIO OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE. THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY HAD A

LIABILITIES TO LIQUID ASSETS RATIO OF 116%, WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL MAXIMUM RESULT OF 105% DUE PRIMARILY TO SIZABLE SUBSIDIARY INVESTMENTS THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF LIQUID ASSETS AND THE 2002 INCREASE IN ASBESTOS RESERVES THAT ARE

INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES. ALSO IN 2003, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE GULF POOL HAD RESULTS FOR THE ONE-YEAR AND TWO-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TO SURPLUS RATIOS RANGING FROM 75% TO 112% AND 88% TO 120%, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL RESULT

OF 20% OR LOWER FOR BOTH OF THESE MEASURES BECAUSE OF RESERVE ADDITIONS RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE RESIDUAL VALUE BUSINESS COUPLED WITH INCREASES IN CORE BUSINESS LINES AND THE RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE. THE RESERVE ADDITIONS ALSO RESULTED

IN THE GULF POOL COMPANIES HAVING TWO-YEAR OVERALL OPERATING RATIOS RANGING FROM 128% TO 134% WHICH IS IN EXCESS OF THE USUAL VALUE OF 100% OR LOWER. IN ADDITION, THE GULF POOL COMPANIES HAD AN ESTIMATED CURRENT RESERVE DEFICIENCY TO SURPLUS RATIO

RANGING FROM 163% TO 268% WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL RESULT OF 25% OR LOWER ALSO DUE TO THESE RESERVE ADDITIONS. THE GULF POOL COMPANIES HAD INVESTMENT YIELD RATIOS RANGING FROM 2.7% TO 3.4% WHICH IS BELOW THE NORMAL MINIMUM VALUE OF 4.5% REFLECTING A

SHORTENING OF THE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AND A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES ON NEW INVESTMENTS. GULF INSURANCE COMPANY HAD A LIABILITIES TO LIQUID ASSETS RATIO OF 115% WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL MAXIMUM RESULT OF 105% DUE PRIMARILY TO

INCREASES IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, A SIZEABLE INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF LIQUID ASSETS AND THE RESERVE ADDITIONS NOTED ABOVE. GULF UNDERWRITERS INSURANCE COMPANY ALSO HAD A GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS TO

SURPLUS RATIO OF 1065%, WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL MAXIMUM VALUE OF 900% DUE TO INCREASES IN PREMIUMS WRITTEN ON CORE SPECIALTY LINES OF BUSINESS.

IN 2002, MOST OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN THE TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY POOL HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE FOR THE ONE YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TO SURPLUS RATIO, THE TWO YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TO SURPLUS RATIO AND THE ESTIMATED CURRENT RESERVE DEFICIENCY TO SURPLUS RATIO RANGING FROM 21% TO 44%, WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL RANGE OF 20% TO 25% OR LOWER, PRIMARILY BECAUSE

OF THE PRETAX STATUTORY INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES FOR ADDITIONS TO ASBESTOS RESERVES IN 2002. IN ADDITION, THREE OF THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL INSURANCE COMPANIES HAD OTHER RATIOS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE. THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY AND THE

STANDARD FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY HAD INVESTMENT YIELD RATIOS OF 3.8% AND 4.2%, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE LESS THAN THE USUAL RESULTS OF 4.5% OR HIGHER, REFLECTING THE DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES ON NEW INVESTMENTS AND LOWER DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARY

EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY AND TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY HAD LIABILITIES TO LIQUID ASSETS RATIOS OF 120% AND 107%, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL RESULT OF 105% OR LOWER DUE PRIMARILY TO SIZABLE

SUBSIDIARY INVESTMENTS THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF LIQUID ASSETS AND AN INCREASE IN ASBESTOS RESERVES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES. THE TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY AND THE STANDARD FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY EACH HAD A CHANGE

IN SURPLUS RATIO OF -12%, WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL RESULT OF -10% DUE TO A NET LOSS RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM CHARGES FOR ADDITIONS TO ASBESTOS RESERVES IN 2002. ALSO IN 2002, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE GULF POOL HAD RESULTS FOR THE TWO YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TO SURPLUS RATIO RANGING FROM 32% TO 44%, WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL RESULT OF 20% OR LOWER BECAUSE OF RESERVE ADDITIONS RELATED TO A RUN-OFF PRODUCT LINE. IN ADDITION, THE GULF POOL COMPANIES HAD AN ESTIMATED CURRENT RESERVE

DEFICIENCY TO SURPLUS RATIO RANGING FROM 46% TO 84%, WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL RESULT OF 25% OR LOWER AND A CHANGE IN NET WRITINGS RATIO RANGING FROM 223% TO 403%, WHICH EXCEEDED THE USUAL RESULT OF 33% OR LOWER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECT OF THEIR

REMOVAL FROM THE TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY POOL AND THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE GULF POOL. GULF INSURANCE COMPANY AND GULF UNDERWRITERS INSURANCE COMPANY HAD INVESTMENT YIELD RATIOS OF 4.3% AND 3.9%, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE LESS THAN THE USUAL

RESULT OF 4.5% OR HIGHER REFLECTING A SHORTENING OF THE DURATION OF THE PORTFOLIO AND A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES ON NEW INVESTMENTS. GULF UNDERWRITERS INSURANCE COMPANY ALSO HAD A GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS TO SURPLUS RATIO OF 1235%, WHICH EXCEEDED THE

USUAL RESULT OF 900% OR LOWER DUE TO INCREASES IN PREMIUMS WRITTEN ON CORE SPECIALTY LINES AND THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANIES REMOVAL FROM THE TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY POOL AND THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE GULF POOL.

IN ALL OF THESE INSTANCES IN PRIOR YEARS, REGULATORS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED UPON

FOLLOW-UP THAT NO REGULATORY ACTION WAS REQUIRED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SIMILAR RESULTS COULD OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE REGULATORY ACTION AS A RESULT OF THE 2004 IRIS RATIO RESULTS. NO REGULATORY ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN BY ANY

STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT OR THE NAIC WITH RESPECT TO IRIS RATIOS OF ANY OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC) REQUIREMENTS

IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE REGULATION OF INSURER SOLVENCY, THE NAIC HAS ADOPTED A FORMULA AND MODEL LAW TO IMPLEMENT RBC

REQUIREMENTS FOR MOST PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION THAT STATUTORY SURPLUS PROVIDES FOR POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS. THE RBC FORMULA FOR

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES MEASURES THREE MAJOR AREAS OF RISK FACING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS.



UNDERWRITING, WHICH ENCOMPASSES THE RISK OF ADVERSE LOSS DEVELOPMENTS AND INADEQUATE PRICING;



DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES ARISING FROM MARKET AND/OR CREDIT RISK; AND



OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK ARISING FROM ADVERSE EXPERIENCE FROM NON-CONTROLLED ASSETS, GUARANTEES FOR AFFILIATES OR OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND RESERVE AND PREMIUM GROWTH.

UNDER LAWS ADOPTED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES,

INSURERS HAVING TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED BY THE RBC CALCULATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL INADEQUACY.

THE RBC LAW PROVIDES FOR FOUR LEVELS OF REGULATORY ACTION. THE EXTENT OF

REGULATORY INTERVENTION AND ACTION INCREASES AS THE LEVEL OF SURPLUS TO RBC FALLS. THE FIRST LEVEL, THE COMPANY ACTION LEVEL AS DEFINED BY THE NAIC, REQUIRES AN INSURER TO SUBMIT A PLAN OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO THE REGULATOR IF SURPLUS FALLS BELOW

200% OF THE RBC AMOUNT. THE REGULATORY ACTION LEVEL, AS DEFINED BY THE NAIC, REQUIRES AN INSURER TO SUBMIT A PLAN CONTAINING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND REQUIRES THE RELEVANT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO PERFORM AN EXAMINATION OR OTHER ANALYSIS AND ISSUE A

CORRECTIVE ORDER IF SURPLUS FALLS BELOW 150% OF THE RBC AMOUNT. THE AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL, AS DEFINED BY THE NAIC, AUTHORIZES THE RELEVANT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO TAKE WHATEVER REGULATORY ACTIONS CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE BEST

INTEREST OF THE POLICYHOLDERS AND CREDITORS OF THE INSURER WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO CAUSE THE INSURER TO BE PLACED UNDER REGULATORY CONTROL, I.E., REHABILITATION OR LIQUIDATION, IF SURPLUS FALLS BELOW 100% OF THE RBC AMOUNT. THE

FOURTH ACTION LEVEL IS THE MANDATORY CONTROL LEVEL AS DEFINED BY THE NAIC, WHICH REQUIRES THE RELEVANT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO PLACE THE INSURER UNDER REGULATORY CONTROL IF SURPLUS FALLS BELOW 70% OF THE RBC AMOUNT.

THE FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE AMONG ADEQUATELY

CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE TO USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, ALL OF THE COMPANYS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES HAD TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS REQUIRING COMPANY OR REGULATORY ACTION AT ANY PRESCRIBED RBC ACTION LEVEL.

ASSET MANAGEMENT REGULATION

ONE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS SUBSIDIARIES IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER/DEALER UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY

THE SEC, NASD REGULATION, INC. AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS. THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES, AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN

RESULT IN THE REVOCATION OF BROKER/DEALER LICENSES, THE IMPOSITION OF CENSURES OR FINES, AND THE SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A FIRM AND/OR ITS EMPLOYEES FROM THE SECURITIES BUSINESS.

EACH OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT ADVISER SUBSIDIARIES IS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS

ACT. VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO BENEFIT THE INVESTMENT PRODUCT HOLDER AND

GENERALLY GRANT SUPERVISORY AGENCIES AND BODIES BROAD ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS, INCLUDING THE POWER TO LIMIT OR RESTRICT NUVEEN INVESTMENTS FROM CARRYING ON ITS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS IN THE EVENT THAT IT FAILS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. IN SUCH EVENT, THE POSSIBLE SANCTIONS

BODILY INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. THESE PROCEEDINGS HAVE RESULTED IN DECISIONS FAVORABLE TO TPC, ALTHOUGH THOSE DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO APPELLATE REVIEW. THE STATUS OF THE VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS IS

DESCRIBED BELOW.

ACANDS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN SEPTEMBER 2002

(

IN RE: ACANDS, INC.,

PENDING IN THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE). IN ITS PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION, ACANDS SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A TRUST TO PAY ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST IT AND SOUGHT TO ASSIGN TO THE

TRUST ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. THE PROPOSED PLAN AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FILED BY ACANDS CLAIMED THAT ACANDS HAD SETTLED THE VAST MAJORITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT FOR

APPROXIMATELY $2.80 BILLION. ACANDS ASSERTS THAT, BASED ON A PRIOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN TPC AND ACANDS AND ACANDS INTERPRETATION OF THE JULY 31, 2003 ARBITRATION PANEL RULING DESCRIBED BELOW, TPC IS LIABLE FOR 45% OF THE $2.80 BILLION. ON JANUARY

26, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ISSUED A DECISION REJECTING CONFIRMATION OF ACANDS PROPOSED PLAN OF

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REORGANIZATION. THE BANKRUPTCY COURT FOUND, CONSISTENT WITH TPCS OBJECTIONS TO ACANDS PROPOSED PLAN, THAT THE PROPOSED PLAN WAS NOT FUNDAMENTALLY

FAIR, WAS NOT PROPOSED IN GOOD FAITH AND DID NOT COMPLY WITH SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. ACANDS HAS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS DECISION AND HAS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS FINDINGS OF FACT

AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT. TPC HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE APPEAL AND OBJECTIONS AND HAS ALSO FILED AN OPPOSITION TO ACANDS OBJECTIONS.

AN ARBITRATION WAS COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2001 TO DETERMINE WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT ACANDS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR

BODILY INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INSURANCE POLICY AGGREGATE LIMITS. ON JULY 31, 2003, THE ARBITRATION PANEL RULED IN FAVOR OF TPC THAT ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST ACANDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE AGGREGATE LIMITS OF THE POLICIES

ISSUED TO ACANDS, WHICH HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED. IN OCTOBER 2003, ACANDS COMMENCED A LAWSUIT SEEKING TO VACATE THE ARBITRATION AWARD AS BEYOND THE PANELS SCOPE OF AUTHORITY (

ACANDS, INC. V. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.,

U.S.D.CT., E.D.

PA.). ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, THE COURT ENTERED AN ORDER DENYING ACANDS MOTION TO VACATE THE ARBITRATION AWARD. ON OCTOBER 6, 2004, ACANDS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL. BRIEFING OF THE APPEAL IS COMPLETE. ORAL ARGUMENT HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED.

IN THE OTHER PROCEEDING, A RELATED CASE PENDING BEFORE THE

SAME COURT AND COMMENCED IN SEPTEMBER 2000 (

ACANDS V. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.

, U.S.D. CT., E.D. PA.), ACANDS SOUGHT A DECLARATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST ACANDS ARE SUBJECT TO OCCURRENCE

LIMITS UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. TPC FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION BASED UPON THE JULY 31, 2003 ARBITRATION DECISION DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE COURT FOUND THE DISPUTE WAS MOOT AS A RESULT OF THE ARBITRATION PANELS DECISION.

THE COURT, THEREFORE, BASED ON THE ARBITRATION PANELS DECISION, DISMISSED THE CASE. ON OCTOBER 6, 2004, ACANDS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL. THIS APPEAL HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE APPEAL REFERENCED IN THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE. BRIEFING OF THE

APPEAL IS COMPLETE. ORAL ARGUMENT HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED.

WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE APPEALS OF THE VARIOUS ACANDS RULINGS OR OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS, BASED ON THESE RULINGS, THE COMPANY WOULD NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS REMAINING UNDER ANY POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC TO

ACANDS.

IN OCTOBER 2001 AND APRIL 2002, TWO PURPORTED CLASS

ACTION SUITS (

WISE V. TRAVELERS

AND

MENINGER V. TRAVELERS

), WERE FILED AGAINST TPC AND OTHER INSURERS (NOT INCLUDING SPC) IN STATE COURT IN WEST VIRGINIA. THESE CASES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE PROCEEDING IN CIRCUIT

COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE INSURER DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BY INAPPROPRIATELY HANDLING AND SETTLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO REOPEN LARGE NUMBERS OF SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS

AND TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, DIRECTLY ON INSURERS. LAWSUITS SIMILAR TO

WISE

WERE FILED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND HAWAII (THESE SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS).

ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2001, PLAINTIFFS IN CONSOLIDATED ASBESTOS ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE A MASS TORT PANEL OF JUDGES IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT MOVED TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT TO NAME TPC AS A DEFENDANT, ALLEGING THAT TPC AND OTHER INSURERS BREACHED

ALLEGED DUTIES TO CERTAIN USERS OF ASBESTOS PRODUCTS. IN MARCH 2002, THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION TO AMEND. PLAINTIFFS SEEK DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF AND RAISING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE PRESENTED IN

THE WEST VIRGINIA AMENDED COMPLAINT ARE ALSO PENDING IN OHIO AND TEXAS STATE COURTS AGAINST TPC AND SPC AND IN LOUISIANA STATE COURT AGAINST TPC (THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THESE SUITS, TOGETHER WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA SUIT, ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO

AS THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS).

ALL OF THE ACTIONS

AGAINST TPC DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, OTHER THAN THE HAWAII ACTIONS, HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER ENTERED BY THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT IN NEW YORK THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY PRESIDED OVER AND APPROVED THE REORGANIZATION

IN BANKRUPTCY OF TPCS FORMER POLICYHOLDER JOHNS- MANVILLE. IN AUGUST 2002, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CONDUCTED A HEARING ON TPCS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION PROHIBITING FURTHER PROSECUTION OF THE LAWSUITS PURSUANT TO THE

REORGANIZATION PLAN AND RELATED ORDERS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS HEARING, THE COURT ORDERED THE PARTIES TO MEDIATION, APPOINTED A MEDIATOR AND CONTINUED THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. DURING 2003, THE SAME BANKRUPTCY COURT EXTENDED THE EXISTING

INJUNCTION TO APPLY TO AN ADDITIONAL SET OF CASES FILED IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS IN TEXAS AND OHIO AS WELL AS TO THE ATTORNEYS WHO

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ARE PROSECUTING THESE CASES. THE ORDER ALSO ENJOINED THESE ATTORNEYS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE LAW FIRMS FROM COMMENCING ANY FURTHER LAWSUITS AGAINST TPC BASED

UPON THESE ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE COURT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE INJUNCTION, ADDITIONAL COMMON LAW CLAIMS WERE FILED AND SERVED ON TPC.

ON NOVEMBER 19, 2003, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT A SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS HAD BEEN REACHED. THIS SETTLEMENT

INCLUDES A LUMP SUM PAYMENT OF UP TO $412 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. AFTER CONTINUED MEETINGS WITH THE MEDIATOR, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON MAY 25, 2004 THAT A SETTLEMENT RESOLVING

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PENDING AND SIMILAR FUTURE COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC HAD ALSO BEEN REACHED. THIS SETTLEMENT REQUIRES A PAYMENT OF UP TO $90 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. EACH OF THESE SETTLEMENTS IS

CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ORDER OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CLARIFYING THAT ALL OF THESE CLAIMS, AND SIMILAR FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, ARE BARRED BY PRIOR ORDERS ENTERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ORIGINAL JOHNS-MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.

ON AUGUST 17,

2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED AN ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS AND CLARIFYING ITS PRIOR ORDERS THAT ALL OF THE PENDING STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON LAW CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST TPC ARE BARRED. THE ORDER ALSO APPLIES

TO SIMILAR DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

FIVE APPEALS WERE TAKEN FROM THE AUGUST 17, 2004 RULING. THESE APPEALS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED AND ARE CURRENTLY PENDING. THE PARTIES HAVE COMPLETED BRIEFING ALL OF THE ISSUES AND AWAIT A DATE FOR ORAL ARGUMENT. THE COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION

TO PAY ANY OF THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS UNLESS AND UNTIL THE ORDERS AND RELIEF BECOME FINAL AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY FURTHER APPELLATE REVIEW. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW APPELLATE COURTS WILL RULE ON THE PENDING APPEALS.

SPC, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT RULINGS OR THE SETTLEMENTS

DESCRIBED ABOVE, HAS NUMEROUS DEFENSES IN ALL OF THE DIRECT ACTION CASES ASSERTING COMMON LAW CLAIMS THAT ARE PENDING AGAINST IT. MANY OF THESE DEFENSES HAVE BEEN RAISED IN INITIAL MOTIONS TO DISMISS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS. THERE HAVE BEEN

FAVORABLE RULINGS DURING 2003 AND 2004 IN TEXAS AND DURING 2004 IN OHIO ON SOME OF THESE MOTIONS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS THAT DEALT WITH STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND THE VALIDITY OF THE ALLEGED CAUSES OF ACTIONS. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE

ACTIONS HAVE APPEALED THESE FAVORABLE RULINGS. SPCS DEFENSES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THESE NOVEL THEORIES HAVE NO BASIS IN LAW; THAT THEY ARE DIRECTLY AT ODDS WITH THE WELL ESTABLISHED LAW PERTAINING TO THE INSURED/INSURER RELATIONSHIP; THAT

THERE IS NO GENERALIZED DUTY TO WARN AS ALLEGED BY THE PLAINTIFFS; AND THAT THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AS TO MANY OF THESE CLAIMS HAS LONG SINCE EXPIRED.

THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING ITS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS

DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF THESE DISPUTES IS UNCERTAIN. IN THIS REGARD, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE, INCLUDING SETTLING LITIGATION UNDER

APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE, SEE ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT LEGAL OUTCOMES AND THEIR IMPACT ON

THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. ANY SUCH DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THESE

UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN

ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

TPC AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WERE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THREE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY SHAREHOLDERS

ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC AND SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS WELL AS UNSPECIFIED MONETARY DAMAGES. THE ACTIONS WERE CAPTIONED

FARINA V. TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., ET AL.

(JUD. DIST. OF WATERBURY, CT. DECEMBER

15, 2003). THE

FARINA

COMPLAINT ALSO NAMED SPC AND ITS FORMER SUBSIDIARY, ADAMS ACQUISITION CORP., AS DEFENDANTS, ALLEGING THAT THEY AIDED AND ABETTED THE ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. ON MARCH 18, 2004, TPC AND SPC ANNOUNCED THAT ALL OF

THESE LAWSUITS HAD BEEN SETTLED, SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENTS. THE SETTLEMENT INCLUDED A MODIFICATION TO THE TERMINATION FEE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PAID HAD THE MERGER NOT BEEN COMPLETED, ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE IN THE PROXY STATEMENT

DISTRIBUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER AND A NOMINAL AMOUNT FOR ATTORNEYS FEES. BEFORE COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT, ADDITIONAL SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION WAS COMMENCED, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. IN LIGHT OF THAT LITIGATION, THE PARTIES ARE

EVALUATING HOW TO PROCEED.

BEGINNING IN AUGUST 2004, FOLLOWING

POST-MERGER ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY COMMENCED FOURTEEN PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA. PLAINTIFF SHAREHOLDERS ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THE APRIL 2004 MERGER BETWEEN TPC AND SPC CONTAINED FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE VALUE OF SPCS LOSS RESERVES IN VIOLATION OF

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. THE COMPLAINTS DO NOT SPECIFY DAMAGES. THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT YET FILED A CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT.

AN ADDITIONAL PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION BASED ON THE SAME ALLEGATIONS WAS BROUGHT IN NEW YORK STATE SUPREME COURT. THIS ACTION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFERRED TO, AND IS CURRENTLY PENDING IN, THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.

IN ADDITION, FIVE OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA. TWO OF THESE ACTIONS,

KAHN V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(NOV. 2, 2004) AND

MICHAEL A. BERNSTEIN

PROFIT SHARING PLAN V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(NOV. 10, 2004), ARE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT BY CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. IN

THESE TWO ACTIONS, PLAINTIFF SHAREHOLDERS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS ALLEGED FAILURE TO MAKE DISCLOSURE RELATING TO THE PRACTICE OF PAYING BROKERS COMMISSIONS ON A CONTINGENT BASIS. TWO

DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST ALL CURRENT DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, NAMING THE COMPANY AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT. IN

ROWE V. FISHMAN, ET AL.

(OCT. 22, 2004), THE PLAINTIFF SHAREHOLDER ALLEGES STATE LAW CLAIMS, INCLUDING BREACH OF

FIDUCIARY DUTY, BASED ON ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE ALLEGED IN

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION

DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN

CLARK V. FISHMAN, ET AL.

(NOV. 18, 2004), THE PLAINTIFF SHAREHOLDER ALLEGES STATE LAW CLAIMS, INCLUDING

BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, BASED ON THE COMPANYS ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT OF AND FAILURE TO MAKE DISCLOSURE RELATING TO THE PRACTICE OF PAYING BROKERS COMMISSIONS ON A CONTINGENT BASIS. THE DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR PRETRIAL

PROCEEDINGS AS

ROWE, ET AL. V. FISHMAN, ET AL

. IN THE FIFTH OF THESE ACTIONS, AN ALLEGED BENEFICIARY OF THE COMPANYS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN HAS COMMENCED A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CAPTIONED

SPIZIRI V. THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., ET AL.

(DEC. 28, 2004). THE PLAINTIFF ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT BASED ON ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR

TO THOSE ALLEGED IN

IN RE ST.PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD. THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED UNDER MINNESOTA LAW. AS PART OF THAT OBLIGATION, THE COMPANY WILL ADVANCE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES THEY INCUR IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS

IN PREVIOUS FILINGS, THE COMPANY REPORTED ON A SERIES OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND ONE MULTI-PARTY ACTION BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS AROUND THE UNITED

STATES AGAINST CERTAIN OF TPCS SUBSIDIARIES, DOZENS OF OTHER INSURERS AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON COMPENSATION INSURANCE. THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE ACTIONS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR, AND GENERALLY ALLEGED THAT THE DEFENDANTS CONSPIRED TO COLLECT

EXCESSIVE OR IMPROPER PREMIUMS ON LOSS-SENSITIVE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE POLICIES IN VIOLATION OF STATE INSURANCE LAWS, ANTITRUST LAWS, AND STATE UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES LAWS. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE ACTIONS DO NOT SPECIFY DAMAGES. TPC HAS

VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED THE ACTIONS, WITH ALL BUT A FEW OF THE ACTIONS HAVING BEEN DISMISSED TO DATE. IN ADDITION, THE PLAINTIFFS ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN CLASS CERTIFICATION HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT BELIEVE ITS REMAINING EXPOSURE TO BE SIGNIFICANT.

FROM TIME TO TIME THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN PROCEEDINGS ADDRESSING DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY BE INITIATED BY THE COMPANY OR

THE REINSURERS AND MAY INVOLVE THE TERMS OF THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THE COVERAGE OF PARTICULAR CLAIMS, EXCLUSIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS COUNTERCLAIMS FOR RESCISSION OF THE AGREEMENTS. ONE OF THESE DISPUTES IS THE ACTION DESCRIBED IN

THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH.

GULF, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

TPC, BROUGHT AN ACTION ON MAY 22, 2003, AS AMENDED ON MAY 12, 2004, IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK (

GULF INSURANCE COMPANY V. TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL.

), AGAINST TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY

(TRANSATLANTIC), XL REINSURANCE AMERICA, INC. (XL), ODYSSEY AMERICA REINSURANCE CORPORATION (ODYSSEY), EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE COMPANY (EMPLOYERS) AND GERLING GLOBAL REINSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA (GERLING), TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE UNDER

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND RELATED TO GULFS FEBRUARY 2003 SETTLEMENT OF A COVERAGE DISPUTE UNDER A VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE PROTECTION INSURANCE POLICY. THE REINSURERS HAVE ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING RESCISSION OF THE VEHICLE

RESIDUAL VALUE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT. SEPARATE ACTIONS FILED BY TRANSATLANTIC AND GERLING HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE ORIGINAL GULF ACTION FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES. ON OCTOBER 1, 2003,

GULF ENTERED INTO A FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH EMPLOYERS, AND ALL CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.

ON MAY 26, 2004, THE COURT DENIED GULFS MOTION TO DISMISS CERTAIN CLAIMS ASSERTED BY TRANSATLANTIC AND A JOINT MOTION BY TRANSATLANTIC, XL AND

ODYSSEY FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST GULF. DISCOVERY IS CURRENTLY PROCEEDING IN THE MATTERS. GULF DENIES THE REINSURERS ALLEGATIONS, BELIEVES THAT IT HAS A STRONG LEGAL BASIS TO COLLECT THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS AND

INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THE ACTIONS.

BASED ON THE

COMPANYS BELIEFS ABOUT ITS LEGAL POSITIONS IN ITS VARIOUS REINSURANCE RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ANY OF THESE MATTERS TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

AS PART OF ONGOING, INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS, THE COMPANY AND ITS

AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THE AREAS OF INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS, THE COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT WITH

NON-TRADITIONAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS, LAWYER LIABILITY INSURANCE AND BRANDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SALVAGE AUTOMOBILES. THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS OR WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM: (I) STATE

OUTCOME OF THE VARIOUS AGENCIES INVESTIGATIONS OR THE REVIEWS BEING UNDERTAKEN, OR HOW THESE MATTERS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY, IF AT ALL.

FOUR PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST A NUMBER OF INSURANCE BROKERS AND INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, BY PLAINTIFFS WHO

ALLEGEDLY PURCHASED INSURANCE PRODUCTS THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE DEFENDANT BROKERS. THE COMPLAINTS ARE CAPTIONED

SHELL VACATIONS LLC V. MARSH & MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC.

REDWOOD OIL COMPANY V. MARSH &

MCLENNAN COMPANIES, INC

(N.D. CAL. FEB. 4, 2005) AND

MULCAHEY V. ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO.

(D.N.J. FEBRUARY 23, 2005). PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT VARIOUS

INSURANCE BROKERS CONSPIRED WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH VARIOUS INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, TO ALLOCATE BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS AND RIG BIDS FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS OFFERED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. THE COMPLAINTS INCLUDE CAUSES OF ACTION UNDER THE SHERMAN

ACT, THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT, FEDERAL AND STATE COMMON LAW AND THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS STATES PROHIBITING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS AND UNFAIR AND/OR DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES. PLAINTIFFS SEEK MONETARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING

PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND TREBLED DAMAGES, PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, RESTITUTION, INCLUDING DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS, INTEREST AND COSTS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND

VIGOROUSLY.

IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE

COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS, NOT INVOLVING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, ARISING MOSTLY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS EITHER AS A LIABILITY INSURER DEFENDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS OR AS AN

INSURER DEFENDING COVERAGE CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST IT. WHILE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE QUARTER, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IT

WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR A CALENDAR YEAR OR ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY). ON APRIL 1, 2004, TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) MERGED WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC.

(SPC), AS A RESULT OF WHICH TPC BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF SPC, AND SPC CHANGED ITS NAME TO THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, EACH ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARE OF TPC CLASS A (INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED

PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS) AND CLASS B PAR VALUE $0.01 COMMON STOCK WAS EXCHANGED FOR 0.4334 OF A SHARE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK WITHOUT DESIGNATED PAR VALUE. SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED HAVE BEEN RESTATED

TO REFLECT THE SECOND QUARTER EXCHANGE OF TPC COMMON STOCK FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE ACQUISITION WITH TPC TREATED AS THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIRER.

ACCORDINGLY, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION, USING TPC HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND APPLYING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND COMMITMENTS OF SPC AS OF APRIL 1, 2004.

BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF SPC WERE CONSOLIDATED WITH TPCS. ACCORDINGLY, ALL FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTS OF

TPC FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 AND THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS OF SPC AND TPC FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTS OF TPC.

FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE

CALCULATION AND ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE, REFER TO NOTE 2 TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.

IN 2002, TPC COMPLETED A CORPORATE REORGANIZATION IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THAT

REORGANIZATION AND STOCK OFFERING, REFER TO NOTE 3 TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE COMPANYS DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO ALL ITEMS, OTHER THAN NET INCOME (LOSS), ARE PRESENTED ON A

PRETAX BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

NET INCOME IN 2004

TOTALED $955 MILLION, OR $1.53 PER SHARE DILUTED, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $1.70 BILLION, OR $3.80 PER SHARE DILUTED, IN 2003. THE $741 MILLION DECLINE IN NET INCOME IN 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003 WAS DRIVEN BY $1.59 BILLION OF AFTER-TAX NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ($2.39 BILLION PRETAX). THAT PRETAX NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF $928 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE

COMPANYS ANNUAL ASBESTOS LIABILITY REVIEW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, $290 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER OF $500 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION AND $300 MILLION FOR SURETY, $252 MILLION RELATED TO

A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, $113 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER AND OTHER NET RESERVING ACTIONS, THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS. NET

UNFAVORABLE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY SEGMENTS MORE THAN OFFSET ADDITIONAL INCOME RESULTING FROM THE MERGER AND STRONG OPERATING INCOME GENERATED BY THE COMPANYS PERSONAL SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, AFTER-TAX CATASTROPHE

LOSSES IN 2004 OF $511 MILLION WERE $282 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2003. THE CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2004 WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FOUR HURRICANES THAT STRUCK THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES IN THE THIRD QUARTER.

THE RATE ENVIRONMENT CONTINUED TO MODERATE IN 2004 DUE TO MORE AGGRESSIVE

PRICING IN THE MARKETPLACE. CUSTOMER RETENTION LEVELS REMAINED STABLE THROUGHOUT THE COMPANYS INSURANCE UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS; HOWEVER, NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN 2004 DECLINED WHEN COMPARED WITH THE COMBINED NEW BUSINESS VOLUME OF SPC AND TPC

IN 2003. NET INCOME IN 2004 INCLUDED NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES OF $28 MILLION, COMPARED WITH NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OF $21 MILLION IN 2003.

NET INCOME OF $1.70 BILLION IN 2003 WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER THE NET LOSS OF $27 MILLION IN 2002. RESULTS IN 2003 REFLECTED A FAVORABLE, BUT

MODERATING, RATE ENVIRONMENT IN EXCESS OF LOSS COST TRENDS AND A DECLINE IN UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THOSE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $174 MILLION INCREASE IN AFTER-TAX CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2003. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2003 WAS $309 MILLION, INCLUDING $339 MILLION OF CHARGES RELATED TO RESERVE STRENGTHENING IN THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY GULF INSURANCE COMPANY (GULF). IN 2002, THE $1.49 BILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT WAS DRIVEN BY $1.39 BILLION OF CHARGES RELATED TO ASBESTOS RESERVE STRENGTHENING. IN DECEMBER 2002, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ASBESTOS RESERVES TO $3.40 BILLION, NET OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, AND FULLY UTILIZED THE $800 MILLION PRETAX

BENEFIT UNDER THE CITIGROUP INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT. (FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SEE ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION). THE NET LOSS IN 2002 INCLUDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

OF $243 MILLION DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(FAS 142). NET INCOME IN 2003 INCLUDED $21 MILLION OF NET REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS, COMPARED WITH $99 MILLION OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS IN 2002.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE $6.49 BILLION GROWTH IN EARNED PREMIUMS OVER 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER, AND ALSO REFLECTED

THE EARNED PREMIUM EFFECT OF RATE INCREASES ON RENEWAL BUSINESS OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS AND STRONG CUSTOMER RETENTION LEVELS THROUGHOUT A MAJORITY OF THE MARKETS SERVED BY THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SEGMENTS.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2004 INCREASED $794 MILLION OVER 2003, DUE LARGELY

TO THE INCREASE IN INVESTED ASSETS RESULTING FROM THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, STRONG OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN 2004 CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN INVESTED ASSETS. THE AVERAGE PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELD IN 2004 OF 4.8% DECLINED FROM 5.3% IN 2003, DUE TO A

HIGHER PROPORTION OF TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS AND LOWER YIELDS ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, SPCS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER WAS RECORDED AT ITS FAIR VALUE AS OF THE MERGER DATE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH PURCHASE ACCOUNTING, WHICH REDUCED THE COMPANYS REPORTED AVERAGE INVESTMENT YIELD IN 2004. NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2004 INCLUDED $111 MILLION OF INCOME RESULTING FROM THE INITIAL PUBLIC TRADING OF AN INVESTMENT IN ITS PRIVATE

EQUITY PORTFOLIO.

FEE INCOME IN 2004 GREW 26% OVER 2003,

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NEW BUSINESS IN THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS SECTOR OF THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE SEGMENT NARRATIVE THAT FOLLOWS.

ASSET MANAGEMENT REVENUES OF $390 MILLION WERE GENERATED BY NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER. NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS GROSS SALES OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS IN 2004 FROM THE DATE OF THE MERGER TOTALED $19.86 BILLION.

THE COMPANYS NET PRETAX REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES OF $39 MILLION IN 2004 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING $80 MILLION, WHEREAS NET PRETAX

REALIZED GAINS OF $38 MILLION IN 2003 INCLUDED $90 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) IN 2004 AND 2003 ALSO INCLUDED LOSSES OF $44 MILLION AND $27 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS

WHICH ARE SETTLED DAILY. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE NATURE OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN EACH YEAR IS INCLUDED IN THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION LATER IN THIS DISCUSSION. OTHER REVENUES IN ALL PERIODS PRESENTED PRIMARILY

CONSIST OF PREMIUM INSTALLMENT CHARGES.

EARNED PREMIUMS IN

2003 INCREASED $1.39 BILLION, OR 12%, OVER 2002 DUE TO RATE INCREASES ON RENEWAL BUSINESS, GROWTH IN TARGETED NEW BUSINESS AND STRONG CUSTOMER RETENTION.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME DECREASED $12 MILLION, OR LESS THAN 1%, IN 2003, DESPITE HIGHER AVERAGE INVESTED ASSETS RESULTING FROM STRONG CASH FLOWS FROM

OPERATIONS. THE DECLINE RESULTED FROM A REDUCTION IN PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELDS FROM 6.0% IN 2002 TO 5.3% IN 2003. THAT DECREASE REFLECTED THE LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, THE SHORTENING OF THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY

PORTFOLIO, A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENT HOLDINGS AND REDUCED RETURNS IN THE COMPANYS PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RETURNS IN ARBITRAGE FUND INVESTMENTS.

FEE INCOME INCREASED $105 MILLION, OR 23%, IN 2003, AS BOTH NEW BUSINESS AND

PRICING LEVELS IN THE COMPANYS NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS INCREASED AND MORE WORKERS COMPENSATION BUSINESS WAS WRITTEN BY STATE RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS SERVICED BY NATIONAL ACCOUNTS.

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS WERE $38 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $147

MILLION IN 2002. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS INCLUDED $90 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $284 MILLION IN 2002.

RECOVERIES FROM FORMER AFFILIATE OF $520 MILLION, NET OF TAX, IN 2002 REPRESENT FUNDS RECOVERED UNDER THE CITIGROUP INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT.

EFFECTIVE WITH THE MERGER, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS OPERATIONS CONSIST

OF THE FOLLOWING FOUR SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL, SPECIALTY, PERSONAL (COLLECTIVELY COMPRISING THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SEGMENTS) AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENT WAS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER. PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS FOR THE THREE

INSURANCE SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED, TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE, TO CONFORM WITH THE 2004 PRESENTATION.

THE $5.74 BILLION, OR

43%, INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. ON A PRO FORMA COMBINED BASIS, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2004 WERE LEVEL WITH 2003. BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS IN THE MAJORITY

OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE OPERATIONS REMAINED CONSISTENT WITH 2003 LEVELS, AS THE COMPANY FOCUSED ON RETAINING ITS EXISTING BOOK OF WELL PRICED, PROFITABLE BUSINESS. RATE INCREASES, HOWEVER, CONTINUED TO MODERATE IN 2004, REFLECTING MORE

AGGRESSIVE PRICING IN THE MARKETPLACE. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN THE COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY SEGMENTS IN 2004 DECLINED WHEN COMPARED WITH THE COMBINED NEW BUSINESS VOLUME OF SPC AND TPC IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING THE COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE AND THE

IMPACT OF NEW BUSINESS PREMIUMS IN 2003 FROM RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTIONS. THE NON-RENEWAL OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL PROPERTY, CONSTRUCTION AND SURETY RISKS AND CERTAIN PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS IN THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS ALSO

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2004. PERSONAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED 17% IN 2004 OVER 2003, DUE TO STRONG ORGANIC GROWTH, NEW BUSINESS RESULTING FROM A RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION, STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS AND PRICE INCREASES.

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED $1.26 BILLION, OR 11%, IN 2003.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BUT MODERATING RATE INCREASES, NEW BUSINESS GROWTH IN FAVORABLE MARKETS AND STRONG RETENTION ACROSS ALL MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE WITHDRAWAL IN 2002 OF BUSINESS AT

AMERICAN EQUITY INSURANCE COMPANY AND COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY, BOTH SUBSIDIARIES OF THE NORTHLAND COMPANY (NORTHLAND), A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, AND A ONE-TIME ADDITIONAL $115 MILLION OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2002 DUE TO

THE TERMINATION OF CERTAIN REINSURANCE CONTRACTS BY NORTHLAND. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR NORTHLANDS SUBSIDIARIES IN 2003 WERE $547 MILLION, A DECREASE OF 34% FROM THE 2002 TOTAL OF $825 MILLION. COMMERCIAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS, EXCLUDING

BUSINESS WRITTEN IN NORTHLANDS SUBSIDIARIES, INCREASED $1.03 BILLION, OR 16%, IN 2003. PERSONAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED $506 MILLION, OR 11%, IN 2003.

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, OF WHICH $928 MILLION REPRESENTED A PROVISION TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL ASBESTOS LIABILITY REVIEW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND $290 MILLION REPRESENTED

A PROVISION TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES. ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS OF 2004 UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2003 TOTALED $476 MILLION AND WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT

OF RESERVE STRENGTHENING AT THE COMPANYS GULF SUBSIDIARY. THE 2004 TOTAL ALSO INCLUDED $772 MILLION OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES (NET OF REINSURANCE), COMPARED WITH CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $352 MILLION IN 2003.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED $500 MILLION AND $300 MILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO SPECIALTYS CONSTRUCTION AND SURETY RESERVES, RESPECTIVELY, ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER. UPON HAVING ACCESS TO EACH COMPANYS DETAILED POLICYHOLDER INFORMATION, INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, AND

ACTUARIAL FILES ON APRIL 1, 2004, IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER, THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO BEGIN THE DETAILED PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A UNIFORM AND CONSISTENT APPROACH TO ESTIMATING THE COMBINED COMPANYS LOSS RESERVES. AS PART OF

THAT PROCESS, A TEAM OF ACTUARIES REPRESENTING THE HISTORICAL ACTUARIAL PERSPECTIVES, JUDGMENTS AND METHODS APPLIED BY EACH LEGACY COMPANY, DISCUSSED THEIR VIEWS, METHODOLOGIES, AND ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE DATA.

IN ADDITION TO THE DISCUSSION IN THE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

SECTION OF THIS REPORT, OTHER ITEMS SPECIFICALLY CONSIDERED IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A UNIFORM AND CONSISTENT APPROACH TO ESTIMATING THE COMBINED COMPANYS LOSS RESERVES INCLUDE INTERPRETING THE ACTUARIAL AND CLAIM DATA IN A UNIFORM MANNER

AND DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF DATA SEGMENTATION FOR ESTIMATION PURPOSES. THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND CAN, AND OFTEN DOES, LEAD TO RESERVE ESTIMATES THAT DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE OF PRIOR PERIODS,

PARTICULARLY IN LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY AND COMPLEX EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE RESERVING PROCESS ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE OUTCOMES, THE ACTUARIES INVOLVED HAD TO ANALYZE THEIR DIFFERING VIEWS ON KEY ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS

PREDICTING INFLATION, ESTIMATING CLAIM DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS AND DETERMINING EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO JUDICIAL RULINGS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AMONG OTHERS. THIS INFORMED JUDGMENT IS BROUGHT INTO THE PROCESS BY INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS ACTUARIES,

UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM ADJUSTERS, AND COMPANY MANAGEMENT. ULTIMATELY, THIS PROCESS REQUIRED AN ANALYSIS OF THE VARYING ACTUARIAL JUDGMENTS AND FORWARD-LOOKING ASSESSMENTS. THE RESULT WAS SIMILAR TO A SINGLE, ONGOING INSURANCE ENTERPRISE OBTAINING MORE

INFORMATION IN A REPORTING PERIOD THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY AND IDENTIFYING A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE IN ITS INSURANCE RESERVES IN THAT PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $500 MILLION AND $300 MILLION CHARGE FOR CONSTRUCTION AND SURETY,

RESPECTIVELY, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004.

ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ON THE ANALYSIS PERFORMED IS INCLUDED IN THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT DISCUSSION BELOW.

IN JUNE OF 2004, THE COMPANY DECIDED TO COMMUTE CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER RESULTING IN A $113 MILLION PRIOR YEAR RESERVE CHARGE (IN ADDITION TO A CURRENT YEAR LOSS OF $40 MILLION).

COMMUTATIONS ARE A COMPLETE AND FINAL SETTLEMENT WITH A REINSURER THAT RESULTS IN A DISCHARGE OF ALL OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES TO THE TERMINATED REINSURANCE AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED A CHARGE OF $252 MILLION RELATED TO A SPECIFIC

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR AS DESCRIBED IN THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT DISCUSSION.

OTHER ITEMS INCREASING THE 2004 CLAIMS AND EXPENSES COMPARED TO 2003 INCLUDE $296 MILLION OF CHARGES TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCES FOR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, POLICYHOLDERS RECEIVABLES, AND

CO-SURETY PARTICIPATIONS ON A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR CLAIM. THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES RECOGNIZED A CHANGE IN ESTIMATED DISPUTES WITH REINSURERS AND IS BASED UPON THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE

STRATEGY OF REDUCED REINSURANCE UTILIZATION, INCLUDING THE CESSATION OF ONGOING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN OF SPCS REINSURERS, AND AGGRESSIVE COLLECTION OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. A PROVISION WAS ALSO MADE TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED

UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS FOR LOSS SENSITIVE BUSINESS (PRIMARILY HIGH DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS). THIS INCREASE RECOGNIZED A CHANGE IN ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS DUE AND RESULTED FROM APPLYING THE COMPANYS CREDIT BASED

METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS TO THE RECOVERABLES ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER. BECAUSE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND AMOUNTS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS FOR LOSS SENSITIVE BUSINESS ARE INSURANCE CONTRACT-RELATED ASSETS, THESE ASSETS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE SAME TYPES OF ESTIMATION VARIABLES AS LOSS RESERVES. ALSO DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, A PARTICIPATING CO-SURETY ON A CONTRACT SURETY EXPOSURE ANNOUNCED THAT INSURANCE REGULATORS HAD APPROVED ITS SUBMITTED RUN-OFF PLAN. BASED

UPON INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE OF THE CO-SURETYS RUN-OFF PLAN AND AN ANALYSIS OF THE CO-SURETYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY TO COLLECT THE FULL AMOUNT PROJECTED TO BE OWED BY THE CO-SURETY AND ESTABLISHED AN

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESERVES.

OTHER 2004 CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

RELATED TO THE MERGER INCLUDE $29 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, $92 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, AND A BENEFIT OF $58 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCRETION OF THE FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2004 INCLUDED $100 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE ON SPC DEBT ASSUMED IN THE MERGER.

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES DECREASED $2.02 BILLION, OR 18%, IN 2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE

IN UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2003, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED LOSS COSTS, GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME AND HIGHER CATASTROPHE LOSSES. CATASTROPHE LOSSES, NET OF REINSURANCE, WERE $352 MILLION IN 2003 COMPARED TO $84

MILLION IN 2002. UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDED IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WAS $476 MILLION FOR 2003, COMPARED TO $3.09 BILLION IN 2002. UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2002 INCLUDED $2.95 BILLION OF

ASBESTOS INCURRED LOSSES (PRIOR TO THE BENEFIT RELATED TO RECOVERIES UNDER THE CITIGROUP INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT), WHEREAS 2003 INCLUDED NO ASBESTOS-RELATED UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT.

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS INCREASED $174 MILLION, OR 10%, IN

2003, REFLECTING HIGHER COMMISSION AND PREMIUM TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASES IN EARNED PREMIUMS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $9 MILLION, OR 6%, IN 2003 DUE TO CERTAIN ONE TIME COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER

REFINANCING ACTIVITIES THAT LOWERED AVERAGE INTEREST COSTS, AND HIGHER LEVELS OF TEMPORARY DEBT. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $217 MILLION, OR 15%, IN 2003, REFLECTING BUSINESS GROWTH AND HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAT RESULTED FROM

IMPROVED UNDERWRITING RESULTS.

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

. THE

COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 12.2%, 24.1% AND (183.4)% IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN THE 2004 EFFECTIVE RATE PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN NONTAXABLE INVESTMENT INCOME ON A LOWER LEVEL OF PRETAX

INCOME. THE 2003 INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE RATE REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF PRETAX INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED UNDERWRITING PERFORMANCE. THE 2002 EFFECTIVE RATE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE 2002 ASBESTOS CHARGE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, AS WELL AS

THE IMPACT OF NON-TAXABLE RECOVERIES OF $520 MILLION RELATED TO THE CITIGROUP INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT.

THE GAAP COMBINED RATIOS BEFORE POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

POINT IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHES. THE RESPECTIVE IMPACTS OF THESE FACTORS ON THE 2003 COMBINED RATIO WERE 3.8 POINTS AND 2.8 POINTS. EXCLUDING THESE IMPACTS FROM BOTH YEARS, THE ADJUSTED RATIO OF 91.1 IN 2004 WAS 1.4 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE ADJUSTED

2003 COMBINED RATIO OF 89.7. THE INCREASE IN THE ADJUSTED RATIO PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE HIGHER UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, AS WELL AS EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER.

THE 20.3 POINT IMPROVEMENT IN THE 2003 GAAP COMBINED RATIO RESULTED FROM

LOWER UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO HAVING NO ASBESTOS CHARGES IN 2003, COMPARED TO ASBESTOS CHARGES IN 2002 THAT ADDED 19.2 POINTS. THE BENEFIT FROM PREMIUM RATE INCREASES THAT EXCEEDED LOSS COST TRENDS WERE LARGELY

OFFSET BY HIGHER CATASTROPHE LOSSES.

RENEWAL RIGHTS PURCHASES

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, TPC PURCHASED FROM

ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE USA (RSA), AN UNAFFILIATED INSURER, THE RENEWAL RIGHTS TO RSAS COMMERCIAL LINES NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, MIDDLE MARKET AND MARINE BUSINESSES, AND STANDARD AND PREFERRED PERSONAL LINES BUSINESSES. ALSO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2003, TPC PURCHASED FROM ATLANTIC MUTUAL, AN UNAFFILIATED INSURER, THE RENEWAL RIGHTS TO THE MAJORITY OF ATLANTIC MUTUALS COMMERCIAL LINES INLAND MARINE AND OCEAN CARGO BUSINESSES WRITTEN BY ATLANTIC MUTUALS MARINE DIVISION. THE

MINIMUM PURCHASE PRICE FOR BOTH TRANSACTIONS, WHICH HAS BEEN PAID, WAS $48 MILLION. THE FINAL PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE DETERMINED IN 2005 AND IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO BE $66 MILLION, IS DEPENDENT ON THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS RENEWED BY

THE COMPANY.

ON AUGUST 1, 2002, COMMERCIAL INSURANCE RESOURCES, INC. (CIRI), A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY AND THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR THE

PURCHASE PRICE OF $8.83 PER SHARE, $50 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND 0.4 MILLION COMMON SHARES FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $8.83 PER SHARE, REPRESENTING A 24% OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF CIRI, ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS. THE DIVIDEND RATE ON THE PREFERRED

STOCK WAS 6.0%. THE INTEREST RATE ON THE NOTES WAS 6.0% PAYABLE ON AN INTEREST-ONLY BASIS. THE NOTES WOULD HAVE MATURED ON DECEMBER 31, 2032. TRIDENT II, L.P., MARSH & MCLENNAN CAPITAL PROFESSIONALS FUND, L.P., MARSH & MCLENNAN

EMPLOYEES SECURITIES COMPANY, L.P. AND TRIDENT GULF HOLDING, LLC (COLLECTIVELY TRIDENT) INVESTED $125 MILLION, AND A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY 75 SENIOR EMPLOYEES OF GULF INVESTED $14 MILLION. FIFTY PERCENT OF THE GULF SENIOR EMPLOYEES

INVESTMENT WAS FINANCED BY CIRI. THIS FINANCING WAS COLLATERALIZED BY THE CIRI SECURITIES PURCHASED AND WAS FORGIVABLE IF TRIDENT ACHIEVED CERTAIN INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENTS PROVIDED FOR REGISTRATION RIGHTS AND TRANSFER RIGHTS AND

RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER MATTERS CUSTOMARILY ADDRESSED IN AGREEMENTS WITH MINORITY INVESTORS.

ON MAY 28, 2004, THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY (INDEMNITY), A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED ITS PURCHASE OF ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES (8,970,000 SHARES) OF THE MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK HELD

BY TRIDENT AT A PURCHASE PRICE OF $8.83 PER SHARE AND THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES HELD BY TRIDENT FOR $46 MILLION. BY JUNE 30, 2004, INDEMNITY COMPLETED ITS PURCHASE FROM EMPLOYEES OF $7 MILLION OF THE MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AT A PURCHASE

PRICE OF $8.83 PER SHARE, CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $4 MILLION, AND COMMON EQUITY OF $3 MILLION AT A PURCHASE PRICE OF $8.83 PER SHARE. THE NOTES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES TO FINANCE 50% OF THEIR

INVESTMENT IN CIRI WERE ASSUMED BY INDEMNITY AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE THE EMPLOYEES INVESTMENTS IN CIRI. THE EXCESS OF THE COST TO REPURCHASE THE MINORITY INTEREST OVER THE MINORITY INTEREST CARRYING VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET WAS RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL DURING THE SECOND QUARTER.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OPERATING INCOME OF $862 MILLION IN 2004 DECLINED $199 MILLION, OR 19%, FROM 2003, WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE

THE RESULTS OF SPC. INCLUDED IN 2004 RESULTS WERE $233 MILLION OF AFTER-TAX CATASTROPHE LOSSES, COMPARED WITH AFTER-TAX CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $67 MILLION IN 2003. ALSO IMPACTING 2004 OPERATING INCOME WAS NET AFTER-TAX UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT OF $802 MILLION ($1.18 BILLION, PRETAX), PRIMARILY RELATED TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE STRENGTHENING. NET AFTER-TAX UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $439 MILLION IN 2003.

TOTAL REVENUES OF $11.11 BILLION IN 2004 REFLECTED GROWTH OF $2.12 BILLION IN

EARNED PREMIUMS, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER AND ALSO REFLECTED THE EARNED PREMIUM EFFECT OF MODERATING RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS IN THE COMPANYS CORE COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, INCREMENTAL PREMIUMS

RESULTING FROM THE RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION WITH ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 CONTRIBUTED TO PREMIUM GROWTH IN 2004.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2004 INCREASED $384 MILLION OVER 2003 DUE LARGELY TO THE INCREASE IN INVESTED ASSETS AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, STRONG

OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN INVESTED ASSETS OVER 2003, AND INVESTMENT INCOME RELATED TO THE INITIAL PUBLIC TRADING OF AN INVESTMENT. ALSO IMPACTING NET INVESTMENT INCOME WAS THE EFFECT OF A DECLINE IN PRETAX INVESTMENT

YIELDS DUE TO A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS, AND LOWER YIELDS ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS.

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FEE INCOME DUE TO ITS SERVICE BUSINESSES, WHICH INCLUDE CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES TO LARGE COMPANIES

THAT CHOOSE TO SELF-INSURE A PORTION OF THEIR INSURANCE RISKS, AND CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO WORKERS COMPENSATION RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS, AUTOMOBILE ASSIGNED RISK PLANS AND TO SELF-INSURANCE POOLS. THE STRONG INCREASE IN 2004 FEE

INCOME REFLECTED HIGHER NEW BUSINESS LEVELS, RESULTING, IN PART, FROM THE THIRD QUARTER 2003 RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION WITH ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE, RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES AND MORE WORKERS COMPENSATION BUSINESS BEING WRITTEN BY STATE

RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS.

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN

2004 INCLUDED $1.18 BILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, OF WHICH $927 MILLION REPRESENTED A PROVISION TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS

ANNUAL ASBESTOS LIABILITY REVIEW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND $286 MILLION REPRESENTED A PROVISION TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES. THE ASBESTOS PROVISION PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION COSTS AND ACTIVITY SURROUNDING PERIPHERAL

DEFENDANTS. WITH REGARD TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISION, NEW CLAIMS FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE AND POLLUTION CONTINUE TO DECLINE, THOUGH THE PACE OF THE DECREASE HAS SLOWED. THE AVERAGE SEVERITY OF CLAIMS HAS INCREASED, HOWEVER, LEADING THE COMPANY TO

CONCLUDE THAT RESERVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES NEEDED TO BE INCREASED. IN JUNE 2004, THE COMPANY DECIDED TO COMMUTE CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER, RESULTING IN A PRIOR YEAR RESERVE CHARGE OF $38 MILLION. ALSO INCLUDED IN NET

UNFAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT IN 2004 WAS A STRENGTHENING OF GULF RESERVES, WHICH WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN CORE COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN THE

FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED LOSSES. IN 2003, UNFAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT TOTALED $676 MILLION, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF WHICH WAS $521 MILLION OF RESERVE STRENGTHENING IN THE GULF OPERATIONS.

THAT RESERVE STRENGTHENING WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A LINE OF BUSINESS THAT INSURED THE RESIDUAL VALUES OF LEASED VEHICLES AND THAT HAD BEEN PLACED IN RUNOFF IN LATE 2001, AND THE RESOLUTION OF A RESIDUAL VALUE CLAIM DISPUTE.

ALSO INCLUDED IN CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2004 WERE CATASTROPHE

LOSSES OF $358 MILLION, COMPARED WITH CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $103 MILLION IN 2003. THE LOSSES IN 2004 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE FOUR HURRICANES THAT MADE LANDFALL IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES IN THE THIRD QUARTER, WHEREAS THE 2003 LOSSES

RESULTED FROM A VARIETY OF STORMS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, INCLUDING HURRICANE ISABEL.

OTHER ITEMS INCREASING 2004 CLAIMS AND EXPENSES COMPARED TO 2003 INCLUDE $72 MILLION OF CHARGES TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCES FOR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND POLICYHOLDERS RECEIVABLES,

PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW SECTION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2004 INCLUDED A 13.6 POINT IMPACT FROM PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT AND A 4.1 POINT IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHE LOSSES. IN 2003, THE IMPACTS OF THESE FACTORS ON THE LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE RATIO WERE 10.3 POINTS AND 1.6 POINTS, RESPECTIVELY. EXCLUDING THOSE FACTORS IN BOTH YEARS, THE ADJUSTED LOSS AND LOSS

EXPENSE RATIO IN 2004 OF 62.3 WAS 1.2 POINTS IMPROVED OVER THE ADJUSTED 2003 RATIO OF 63.5. THE 3.3 POINT INCREASE IN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE HIGHER UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF

THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL OTHER (WHERE PREMIUM VOLUME DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY).

OPERATING INCOME OF $1.06 BILLION IN 2003 WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER THE OPERATING LOSS OF $310 MILLION IN 2002. OPERATING RESULTS IN 2003

REFLECTED A FAVORABLE, BUT MODERATING, RATE ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY RATE INCREASES IN EXCESS OF LOSS COST TRENDS, AND INCREASED BUSINESS VOLUMES. AFTER-TAX CATASTROPHE LOSSES TOTALED $67 MILLION IN 2003, WHEREAS IN 2002 THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT

INCURRED NO CATASTROPHES. THE 2002 OPERATING LOSS WAS DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT ASBESTOS-RELATED UNFAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT.

EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2003 GREW $721 MILLION, OR 12%, OVER 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO PREMIUM RATE INCREASES, GROWTH IN TARGETED NEW BUSINESS AND STRONG CUSTOMER

RETENTION. THE STRONG GROWTH IN 2003 EARNED PREMIUMS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $214 MILLION DECLINE IN EARNED PREMIUMS AT THE NORTHLAND SUBSIDIARIES THAT RESULTED FROM THE WITHDRAWAL IN 2002 OF BUSINESS AT AMERICAN EQUITY INSURANCE COMPANY AND

COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY. NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2003 INCREASED $17 MILLION OVER 2002 DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE INVESTED ASSETS RESULTING FROM STRONG CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REDUCTION IN AVERAGE PRETAX

INVESTMENT YIELDS TO 5.3% IN 2003 FROM 6.0% IN 2002. THE DECREASE IN YIELDS REFLECTED THE LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, THE SHORTENING OF THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TAX-EXEMPT

INVESTMENTS AND REDUCED RETURNS IN THE COMPANYS PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS; PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RETURNS IN ARBITRAGE FUND INVESTMENTS. THE $99 MILLION, OR 22%, INCREASE IN FEE INCOME IN 2003 OVER 2002 REFLECTED HIGHER NEW BUSINESS

LEVELS, PRICE INCREASES AND MORE WORKERS COMPENSATION BUSINESS BEING WRITTEN BY STATE RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2003 DECREASED $2.23 BILLION, OR 30%, PRIMARILY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND INCREASED LOSS COSTS RESULTING FROM GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME. CATASTROPHE LOSSES TOTALED $103 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH NO CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2002. CATASTROPHE

LOSSES IN 2003 WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A SEVERE WINTER STORM IN COLORADO IN THE FIRST QUARTER, SEVERE STORMS IN THE SECOND QUARTER IN A NUMBER OF SOUTHERN AND MIDWESTERN STATES AND HURRICANE ISABEL IN THE THIRD QUARTER. UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDED IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WAS $676 MILLION IN 2003 COMPARED TO $3.12 BILLION IN 2002. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF 2003 PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT WAS THE GULF RESERVE STRENGTHENING OF $521 MILLION

REFERRED TO PREVIOUSLY. IN ADDITION TO THE GULF CHARGES, UNFAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2003 INCLUDED CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH AMERICAN EQUITY INSURANCE COMPANY AND AN INCREASE IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES. NO ASBESTOS-RELATED PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS RECORDED IN 2003. UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2002 INCLUDED $2.95 BILLION OF ASBESTOS-RELATED CHARGES (PRIOR TO THE BENEFIT RELATED TO RECOVERIES UNDER THE CITIGROUP INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT). FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SEE ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

SEPARATELY, THE COMPANY STRENGTHENED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES IN THE 2002 FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN ITS RESERVES FOR OTHER GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES. THESE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN AS A

RESULT OF PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT EXPERIENCE. IN ADDITION, IN 2003 THE COMPANY STRENGTHENED PRIOR YEAR RESERVES FOR CERTAIN RUN-OFF LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING ASSUMED REINSURANCE, AND EXPERIENCED FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IN CERTAIN ON-GOING

BUSINESSES.

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

INCREASED $82 MILLION, OR 9%, IN 2003, REFLECTING HIGHER COMMISSION AND PREMIUM TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN EARNED PREMIUMS. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2003 INCREASED $150 MILLION, OR 18%, OVER 2002, DRIVEN BY BUSINESS GROWTH

AND HIGHER COMMISSION EXPENSE THAT RESULTED FROM IMPROVED UNDERWRITING RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE 33.9 POINT IMPROVEMENT IN THE 2003 GAAP LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OVER 2002 PRIMARILY

RESULTED FROM LOWER UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE PRIOR-YEAR ASBESTOS-RELATED CHARGES IN 2002 ADDED 36.8 POINTS TO THAT YEARS LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO, WHEREAS IN 2003 NO PRIOR-YEAR ASBESTOS-RELATED CHARGES WERE

INCURRED. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF PREMIUM RATE INCREASES THAT EXCEEDED LOSS COST TRENDS IN 2003 WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES. NO CATASTROPHE LOSSES WERE INCURRED IN 2002. THE 0.6 POINT DECREASE IN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE

RATIO IN 2003 COMPARED WITH 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BENEFITS OF THE FAVORABLE RATE ENVIRONMENT AND HIGHER FEE INCOME, LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAT RESULT FROM IMPROVED UNDERWRITING PERFORMANCE.

PREMIUMS IN 2004 INCREASED $1.35 BILLION, OR 20%, OVER 2003, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. BUSINESS RETENTION RATES REMAINED STRONG AND RENEWAL PRICE CHANGE INCREASES MODERATED TO THE LOW-SINGLE DIGIT LEVELS IN 2004. NEW BUSINESS

VOLUME DECLINED, HOWEVER, WHEN COMPARED WITH THE COMBINED NEW BUSINESS VOLUME OF SPC AND TPC IN 2003, REFLECTING THE INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE AND THE IMPACT OF HIGHER PREMIUM FLOW IN 2003 ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL RENEWAL RIGHTS

TRANSACTIONS.

COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS PREMIUM VOLUME OF

$4.21 BILLION IN 2004 GREW $960 MILLION, OR 30%, OVER 2003 VOLUME OF $3.25 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MERGER. RETENTION RATES REMAINED STRONG AND RENEWAL PRICE CHANGE INCREASES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR. NEW BUSINESS LEVELS

MODERATED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2004 AS THE BENEFIT FROM THE ATLANTIC MUTUAL AND ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTIONS COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 DIMINISHED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

SELECT ACCOUNTS 2004 PREMIUM VOLUME OF $2.56 BILLION INCREASED $508

MILLION, OR 25%, OVER 2003, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE MERGER. OVERALL RETENTION RATES WERE STRONG AND RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES MODERATED TO THE MID SINGLE-DIGITS. RETENTION AND GROWTH WERE STRONGEST IN SMALLER, HIGH TRANSACTION VOLUME ACCOUNTS,

REFLECTING THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN AGENCY AUTOMATION, PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND SERVICE TO AGENTS.

THE 13% INCREASE IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2004 REFLECTED NEW BUSINESS FROM THE THIRD-QUARTER 2003 ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE RENEWAL

RIGHTS TRANSACTION AND HIGHER BUSINESS VOLUMES IN RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS, THE IMPACTS OF WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SHIFT TO DEDUCTIBLE AND FEE-BASED PRODUCTS BY SOME OF THE COMPANYS CLIENTS.

IN THE COMMERCIAL OTHER BUSINESS, THE $226 MILLION, OR 31%, DECLINE IN 2004

PREMIUM VOLUME COMPARED WITH 2003 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE PLACEMENT OF GULF OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. SUBSEQUENTLY, CERTAIN BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN BY GULF IS NOW BEING WRITTEN IN THE COMMERCIAL OR SPECIALTY SEGMENTS.

THE RUNOFF HEALTHCARE, REINSURANCE AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER PRODUCED MINIMAL WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2004.

COMMERCIAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED $532 MILLION, OR 8%, IN 2003. RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES, HIGHER NEW BUSINESS LEVELS, AND STRONG CUSTOMER RETENTION

ACROSS ALL MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS COMBINED TO DRIVE PREMIUM GROWTH OVER 2002. THIS PREMIUM GROWTH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECREASE IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS AT THE NORTHLAND SUBSIDIARIES DUE TO THE WITHDRAWAL IN 2002 OF BUSINESS AT CERTAIN OF

THOSE SUBSIDIARIES AND A ONE-TIME

ADDITIONAL $115 MILLION OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUM IN 2002 RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF CERTAIN REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR THE NORTHLAND

SUBSIDIARIES WERE $547 MILLION IN 2003 COMPARED TO $825 MILLION IN 2002. THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES IS INCLUDED WITH COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS.

COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED $100 MILLION, OR 3%, IN 2003. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NORTHLAND SUBSIDIARIES DECLINED

TO $547 MILLION IN 2003 FROM $825 MILLION IN 2002 DUE TO THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. EXCLUDING THE NORTHLAND SUBSIDIARIES NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN BOTH 2003 AND 2002, COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2003 GREW 16% OVER 2002. THE INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES, NEW BUSINESS GROWTH IN TARGETED MARKETS AND STRONG RETENTION ACROSS ALL MAJOR PRODUCT LINES.

SELECT ACCOUNTS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2003 INCREASED $178 MILLION, OR 10%, OVER 2002. THE INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES, NEW

BUSINESS AND STRONG RETENTION. NEW BUSINESS GROWTH WAS ESPECIALLY STRONG IN PROPERTY, GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL LINES OF BUSINESS. SELECT ACCOUNTS RETENTION LEVELS IN 2003 WERE STRONGEST FOR SMALL COMMERCIAL BUSINESS HANDLED

THROUGH THE COMPANYS SERVICE CENTERS, WHILE PREMIUM GROWTH WAS CENTERED IN THE COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND PROPERTY PRODUCT LINES.

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2003 INCREASED $190 MILLION, OR 30%, OVER 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONTINUED BENEFIT FROM RATE INCREASES,

HIGHER NEW BUSINESS LEVELS THAT, IN PART, RESULTED FROM THE COMPANYS THIRD QUARTER 2003 RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION WITH ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE AND HIGHER BUSINESS VOLUME IN RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS.

THE COMMERCIAL OTHER SECTOR OF THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT IN 2003 AND 2002

CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS GULF SUBSIDIARY, WHICH MARKETED PRODUCTS TO NATIONAL, MID-SIZED AND SMALL CUSTOMERS AND DISTRIBUTED THEM THROUGH BOTH WHOLESALE BROKERS AND RETAIL AGENTS AND BROKERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES

WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON MANAGEMENT AND PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY COVERAGES AND EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES OF INSURANCE. GULF NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED $83 MILLION, OR 14%, IN 2003 AS A RESULT OF SIGNIFICANT RATE INCREASES ACROSS ALL CLASSES OF

MANAGEMENT LIABILITY PRODUCTS.

THE MERGER AS WELL AS OTHER NET RESERVING ACTIONS THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN THE NARRATIVE THAT FOLLOWS. IN JUNE 2004, THE COMPANY DECIDED TO COMMUTE CERTAIN

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER, RESULTING IN A PRIOR YEAR RESERVE CHARGE OF $75 MILLION. OPERATING RESULTS IN 2004 ALSO INCLUDED $155 MILLION OF AFTER-TAX CATASTROPHE LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE FOUR HURRICANES DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY,

WHEREAS 2003 RESULTS INCLUDED NO CATASTROPHE LOSSES.

DOMESTIC

SPECIALTY EARNED PREMIUMS TOTALED $3.86 BILLION IN 2004, COMPARED WITH $1.17 BILLION IN 2003. INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2004 WERE $930 MILLION, WHEREAS 2003 RESULTS INCLUDED MINIMAL INTERNATIONAL PREMIUMS. THE INCREASES OVER 2003

WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL PREMIUMS RESULTING FROM THE MERGER, AND ALSO REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES. NET INVESTMENT INCOME INCREASED $324 MILLION OVER 2003 DUE TO THE INCREASE IN INVESTED ASSETS AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. IN

ADDITION, STRONG OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN INVESTED ASSETS OVER THE SAME PERIOD OF 2003. ALSO IMPACTING IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME IS THE EFFECT OF A DECLINE IN PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELDS DUE TO A HIGHER PROPORTION OF

TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS AND LOWER YIELDS ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR LOSS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND SURETY

RESERVES, ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER AS WELL AS OTHER NET RESERVING ACTIONS.

CONSTRUCTION RESERVES

BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC, PERSONNEL FROM THE PREDECESSOR COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO SHARE DETAILED POLICYHOLDER INFORMATION, CLAIM FILES AND ACTUARIAL DATA RELATED TO THE ACQUIRED CONSTRUCTION

RESERVES. THIS ENABLED AN ANALYSIS TO BE PERFORMED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE ACQUIRED CONSTRUCTION RESERVES USING TPCS LONG-ESTABLISHED PRACTICES THAT INCLUDES EVALUATING EXPOSURES BY TYPE OF CLAIM (E.G. CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, CONSTRUCTION

WRAP UP, OTHER), BY TYPE OF COVERAGE, (E.G. GUARANTEED COST, LOSS RESPONSIVE, OTHER) AND BY DETAILED LINE OF BUSINESS (GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL AUTO, ETC.), AMONG OTHERS. FOR GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES, WHICH INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT AND

CONSTRUCTION WRAP-UP, INTERPRETATION OF UNDERLYING TRENDS (BOTH PRESENT AND FUTURE) AND THE RELATED RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS IS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL DUE TO THE LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY AND COMPLEX NATURE OF THESE EXPOSURES. IN PARTICULAR, FOR

CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO WHETHER COVERAGE EXISTS, WHEN LOSSES OCCUR, THE SIZE OF EACH LOSS, EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE INTERPRETIVE RULINGS CONCERNING CONTRACT PROVISIONS AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE

ASSERTION OF THESE CLAIMS WILL EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY. AS A RESULT, MATERIAL VARIATIONS CAN AND DO OCCUR AMONG ACTUARIAL RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THESE TYPES OF EXPOSURES. IN A MERGER, THESE DIFFERENCES ARE LIKELY TO BE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED. PRIOR TO A

MERGER, EACH LEGACY COMPANY CONSISTENTLY APPLIES ITS ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ACTUARIAL METHODS TO ESTIMATE RESERVES. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ACTUARIAL METHODS NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND RECONCILED, AND A UNIFORM

APPROACH NEEDS TO BE ADOPTED FOR THE MERGED ENTITY. IN THIS SITUATION, MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS CAN AND DO OCCUR FOR RESERVES RELATED TO EXPOSURES HAVING A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY.

ANALYSIS OF THE ACQUIRED CONSTRUCTION RESERVES WAS COMPLETED NEAR THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. BASED UPON THE

RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ACQUIRED NET CONSTRUCTION RESERVES BY $500 MILLION, INCLUDING $400 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT AND $100 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION WRAP-UP CLAIMS, AND RECOGNIZED THIS CHANGE IN

ESTIMATE AS AN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGE IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THERE WAS NO REINSURANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHARGE.

SURETY RESERVES

BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, UPON COMPLETION OF THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC, PERSONNEL FROM THE PREDECESSOR COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO SHARE THE DETAILED SPC

POLICYHOLDER INFORMATION, INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CLAIM AND ACTUARIAL FILES RELATED TO SURETY RESERVES. ACCESS TO THIS DETAILED INFORMATION ENABLED THE COMPANY TO PERFORM A CLAIM-BY-CLAIM REVIEW OF RESERVES AND CLAIMS HANDLING STRATEGIES DURING THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2004 USING THE COMBINED EXPERTISE OF CLAIMS ADJUSTERS FROM THE LEGACY COMPANIES. THIS TYPE OF REVIEW INVOLVES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK WITHIN WHICH CLAIMS WILL BE SETTLED,

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ESTIMATES FOR DATES OF LOSS OCCURRENCE AND EVALUATIONS OF IBNR EXPOSURES FOR EACH INSURED. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF THE DETAILED INFORMATION OBTAINED

CONCERNING CONTRACTORS WITH REPORTED CLAIMS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERED WHETHER OR NOT LOSSES WERE INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED ON ONE OR MORE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS FOR EACH CONTRACTOR EXAMINED.

ALSO ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE COMPANY COULD BEGIN TO USE THIS DETAILED

INFORMATION TO COMPARE SPCS ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ACTUARIAL METHODS THAT WERE UNDERLYING THE ACQUIRED RESERVES WITH ITS OWN ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ACTUARIAL METHODS. SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND TO EXIST. SIMILARITIES

INCLUDED, BUT WERE NOT LIMITED TO, RECOGNIZING CLAIM RESERVES WHEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT CONTRACTORS AND COMMERCIAL SURETY INSUREDS WERE IN DEFAULT AND THEREBY UNABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, ESTIMATING INITIAL IBNR PROVISIONS, AND PERIODICALLY

RE-EVALUATING, AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ADEQUACY OF THE RESERVES ESTABLISHED BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIMS RECORDED AND REVISED ESTIMATES OF IBNR. DIFFERENCES INCLUDED JUDGMENTS AND METHODS RELATED TO DETERMINING IBNR DEVELOPMENT FACTORS AND EXPECTED

SALVAGE, AMONG OTHERS.

THAT THESE DIFFERENCES EXIST IS NOT

UNUSUAL FOR SURETY RESERVE ESTIMATES. SURETY IS A LINE OF BUSINESS FOR WHICH THERE ARE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY, VERY COMPLEX CLAIMS FOR CERTAIN EXPOSURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS AND COMMERCIAL SURETY

INSUREDS. DETERMINING THE DATE OF LOSS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, THE CLAIM RESERVE ESTIMATES EVEN FOR REPORTED CLAIMS ARE ALSO HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL. THESE TWO FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COMBINE TO MAKE IBNR

RESERVE ESTIMATIONS FOR SURETY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. DUE TO THIS HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY, THE INFORMED JUDGMENTS OF DIFFERENT ACTUARIES COULD AND DO VARY MATERIALLY. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN A MERGER, THESE DIFFERENCES ARE LIKELY TO BE EVEN MORE

PRONOUNCED.

THE CLAIM REVIEWS AND ACTUARIAL ANALYSES WERE BOTH

COMPLETED NEAR THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF THESE REVIEWS AND ANALYSES, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ACQUIRED NET SURETY RESERVES BY $300 MILLION, NET OF $170 MILLION OF REINSURANCE, AND RECOGNIZED

THIS CHANGE IN ESTIMATE AS AN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGE IN THE SECOND QUARTER.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER AND BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, SPC DISCLOSED THAT A LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR FOR WHICH IT HAD WRITTEN SEVERAL SURETY BONDS WAS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY. BASED UPON AN

ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR THAT WAS PERFORMED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, A RESTRUCTURING PLAN WAS ADOPTED BY THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, ITS BANKS, AND SPC, AMONG OTHERS, AS A MEANS TO MINIMIZE ESTIMATED

LOSSES. SPC MONITORED THE PROGRESS OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR TOWARD MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN THROUGHOUT SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS. SPC ALSO ESTIMATED AND DISCLOSED ITS ESTIMATED ULTIMATE NET LOSSES RELATED TO THIS EXPOSURE,

BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 AND UPDATED EACH QUARTER THEREAFTER, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF ADVANCES MADE OR EXPECTED TO BE MADE TO THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, APPLICABLE COLLATERAL, CO-SURETY PARTICIPATIONS AND REINSURANCE. THE SIZE AND

COMPLEXITY OF THESE PARTICULAR CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS, COUPLED WITH THE DETERIORATING CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR AND THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER IT WOULD MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN, RESULTED IN A

HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSSES.

A

COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS THAT BEGAN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 WAS COMPLETED DURING THE LAST HALF OF THE SECOND QUARTER. BASED UPON THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE CONTRACTOR WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THE TARGETS SET FORTH IN ITS

BUSINESS AND RESTRUCTURING PLANS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY MOVED FROM SUPPORTING THE CONTRACTORS RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO ADOPTING A WORKOUT PLAN AS A MEANS TO MINIMIZE ESTIMATED LOSSES. UNDER THE WORKOUT PLAN, THE COMPANY WOULD NO LONGER PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL SURETY BONDS FOR NEW PROJECTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR. ALSO AS PART OF THE WORKOUT PLAN, THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING AND ENGINEERING PROCEDURES FOR EACH OPEN PROJECT, WHICH INCLUDED USING SPECIALISTS TO

IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL FORECASTING, CASH MANAGEMENT, AND REPORTING PROCEDURES, ON BOTH A PROJECT-BY-PROJECT AND CONSOLIDATED LEVEL. BASED UPON THIS SECOND QUARTER CHANGE TO A WORKOUT PLAN AND THE DETAILED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS THAT WAS ABLE TO BE

PERFORMED, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE NET LOSS BY $252 MILLION, INCLUDING $9 MILLION OF REINSURANCE. THIS ESTIMATE TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION PAID AMOUNTS, NET RECEIVABLES, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, OVERHEAD

COSTS, ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPLACING THE CONTRACTOR, RECEIVABLE DISCOUNTS, CURRENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS FROM OWNERS AND

SUBCONTRACTORS AGAINST THE CONTRACTOR, AND THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL, AMONG OTHERS.

ALSO DURING THE LAST HALF OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, A PARTICIPATING CO-SURETY ON THIS EXPOSURE ANNOUNCED THAT INSURANCE REGULATORS HAD APPROVED ITS SUBMITTED RUN-OFF PLAN. BASED UPON INDUSTRYS KNOWLEDGE OF

THE CO-SURETYS RUN-OFF PLAN AND THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY TO COLLECT THE FULL AMOUNT PROJECTED TO BE OWED BY THE CO-SURETY AND ESTABLISHED AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF

RESERVES.

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2004 INCLUDED

$225 MILLION OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES, COMPARED WITH NO SUCH LOSSES IN 2003. RESULTS IN 2004 ALSO REFLECTED INCREASED CURRENT YEAR LOSS PROVISIONS ON PORTIONS OF THE BOND AND CONSTRUCTION BOOKS OF BUSINESS, AND $150 MILLION OF UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN TPCS CONSTRUCTION OPERATION PRIOR TO THE MERGER. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CATASTROPHES, THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAINING MARKETS COMPRISING THIS SEGMENT RECORDED STRONG UNDERWRITING RESULTS, DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE

CURRENT YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE.

OTHER ITEMS INCREASING 2004

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES COMPARED TO 2003 INCLUDE $224 MILLION OF CHARGES TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCES FOR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, POLICYHOLDERS RECEIVABLES, AND A CO-SURETY ON A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR CLAIM

PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW SECTION.

THE

COMBINED RATIO IN 2004 INCLUDED A 33.1 POINT IMPACT OF UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND A 4.8 IMPACT OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES. THE IMPACT OF BOTH ITEMS IN 2003 WAS NEGLIGIBLE.

THE $50 MILLION INCREASE IN OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2003 OVER 2002 REFLECTED STRONG RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS BOND

OPERATION. THE $201 MILLION, OR 21%, INCREASE IN EARNED PREMIUMS OVER 2002 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM PREMIUM RATE INCREASES, GROWTH IN TARGETED NEW BUSINESS AND STRONG CUSTOMER RETENTION. THE $5 MILLION DECLINE IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2003

PRIMARILY REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELDS FROM 6.0% IN 2002 TO 5.3% IN 2003.

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES IN 2003 INCLUDED UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALING $12 MILLION, COMPARED WITH UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF $3 MILLION IN 2002.

THE 5.3 POINT IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMBINED RATIO IN 2003 REFLECTED THE IMPACT

OF PRICE INCREASES, HIGHER NEW BUSINESS VOLUMES AND CONTROLLED EXPENSE GROWTH.

LEVELS ALSO DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY. IN BOND, THE REPOSITIONING OF THE BOOK OF BUSINESS WAS PRIMARILY CENTERED IN THE SPC BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER.

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2004 IN THE MAJORITY OF THE

COMPANYS REMAINING DOMESTIC SPECIALTY BUSINESSES WERE STRONG, WITH RETENTION LEVELS AT OR ABOVE HISTORICAL LEVELS. THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON RETAINING THE PROFITABLE AND WELL-PRICED BOOK OF BUSINESS THAT HAS BEEN BUILT IN RECENT YEARS.

RENEWAL PRICE CHANGE INCREASES IN THESE OPERATIONS MODERATED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO THE UPPER SINGLE-DIGIT LEVEL. NEW BUSINESS LEVELS IN 2004 WERE DOWN COMPARED WITH 2003, WHEN RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTIONS CONTRIBUTED TO STRONG GROWTH IN NEW

BUSINESS. THE IMPACT OF THE DECLINE IN NEW BUSINESS LEVELS IN 2004 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PREMIUM GROWTH RESULTING FROM THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN BUSINESS FROM THE COMPANYS GULF OPERATION, WHICH WAS PLACED IN RUNOFF IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE

YEAR. IN ADDITION, PREMIUM VOLUME IN THESE DOMESTIC BUSINESSES BENEFITED IN 2004 FROM A SMALL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENTS COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS OPERATION.

IN INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY, ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS

(EXCLUDING LLOYDS) WERE STRONG RELATIVE TO PRE-MERGER LEVELS. NEW BUSINESS LEVELS WERE CONSISTENT WITH 2003, WHILE THE RATE OF RENEWAL PRICE CHANGE INCREASES MODERATED TO THE LOWSINGLE DIGIT LEVELS. THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON

RETAINING ITS PROFITABLE BOOK OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY BUSINESS. AT LLOYDS, PREMIUM VOLUME WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE PLANNED NON-RENEWAL OF CERTAIN PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE COVERAGES.

THE $218 MILLION, OR 21%, INCREASE IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2003 OVER 2002

REFLECTED A FAVORABLE PREMIUM RATE ENVIRONMENT AND STRONG NEW BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY IN BONDS EXECUTIVE LIABILITY LINES.

OPERATING INCOME OF

AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME, AND STRONG PREMIUM GROWTH REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF UNIT GROWTH AND PRICE INCREASES.

THE $758 MILLION, OR 16%, GROWTH IN EARNED PREMIUMS OVER 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ORGANIC NEW BUSINESS VOLUME, NEW BUSINESS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, CONTINUED STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS AND RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES. NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2004 GREW 22% OVER 2003, DRIVEN BY STRONG

OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS DURING THE YEAR THAT CONTRIBUTED TO A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN INVESTED ASSETS SINCE THE END OF 2003. IN ADDITION, NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2004 BENEFITED FROM $39 MILLION OF INCOME RESULTING FROM THE INITIAL PUBLIC TRADING OF AN

INVESTMENT IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF THE YEAR. ALSO IMPACTING NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2004 WAS THE EFFECT OF A DECLINE IN PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELDS RESULTING FROM A HIGHER PROPORTION

OF TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS, AND GENERALLY LOWER YIELDS ON FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES PURCHASED DURING THE YEAR.

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2004 INCLUDED $378 MILLION OF FAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN THE

FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED HOMEOWNERS LOSSES, AS WELL AS AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY TRENDS IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS. IN 2003, FAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $212 MILLION, ALSO PRIMARILY

DUE TO A DECLINE IN THE FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED HOMEOWNERS LOSSES. THE 2003 TOTAL INCLUDED A $50 MILLION REDUCTION IN THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACK. IN ADDITION, CLAIM AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2004 REFLECTED THE BENEFIT OF LOWER CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE CLAIMS IN THE HOMEOWNERS LINE OF BUSINESS THAN IN 2003. CLAIMS AND EXPENSES IN 2004 INCLUDED CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $189 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $249 MILLION IN 2003. THE 2004 LOSSES WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE FOUR HURRICANES DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, WHEREAS THE 2003 LOSSES RESULTED FROM A VARIETY OF STORMS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING HURRICANE

ISABEL IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE YEAR AND WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. CLAIMS AND EXPENSES IN 2004 ALSO REFLECTED CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN PROCESS RE-ENGINEERING PILOTS TARGETED TO IMPROVE LOSS SEVERITY.

THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS TOTALED $941 MILLION IN 2004,

AN 18% INCREASE OVER THE 2003 TOTAL OF $800 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER COMMISSION AND PREMIUM TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASES IN EARNED PREMIUM PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED, AS WELL AS A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES OF $536 MILLION IN 2004 WERE 28% HIGHER THAN COMPARABLE EXPENSES OF $420 MILLION IN 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH, HIGHER COMMISSION EXPENSE RELATED TO IMPROVED UNDERWRITING RESULTS AND INVESTMENTS IN PERSONNEL, TECHNOLOGY AND

INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2004 REFLECTED A 6.8 POINT FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, COMPARED WITH A FAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR IMPACT OF 4.4 POINTS ON THE 2003 RATIO. CATASTROPHE LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR 3.4

POINTS AND 5.2 POINTS OF THE 2004 AND 2003 RATIOS, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION TO THESE FACTORS, THE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE 2004 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO REFLECTED THE EARNED IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES THAT CONTINUED TO EXCEED

LOSS COST TRENDS. THE 1.2 POINT INCREASE IN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO REFLECTED THE INVESTMENTS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF HIGHER COMMISSION EXPENSES RELATED TO IMPROVED UNDERWRITING RESULTS.

OPERATING INCOME IN 2003 INCREASED $145 MILLION, OR 42%, OVER 2002. OPERATING

INCOME IN 2003 BENEFITED FROM A FAVORABLE, BUT MODERATING, PREMIUM RATE ENVIRONMENT IN BOTH AUTOMOBILE AND PROPERTY, INCREASED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND A CONTINUED MODERATION IN THE INCREASE IN LOSS COSTS.

EARNED PREMIUMS INCREASED $468 MILLION, OR 11%, IN 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO

HIGHER RATES, GROWTH IN NEW BUSINESS VOLUMES AND STRONG RETENTION LEVELS. NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2003 DECREASED $24 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2002, DESPITE AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE INVESTED ASSETS RESULTING FROM STRONG OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS. THE

DECLINE RESULTED FROM A REDUCTION IN PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELDS, WHICH REFLECTED A LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, THE SHORTENING OF THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENTS AND

SLIGHTLY LOWER RETURNS FROM THE COMPANYS PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2003 INCLUDED FAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $212 MILLION, COMPARED WITH FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF $30 MILLION IN 2002. THE FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IN 2003 RESULTED

FROM IMPROVEMENT IN NON-CATASTROPHE-RELATED CLAIM FREQUENCY FOR BOTH HOMEOWNERS AND NON-BODILY-INJURY AUTOMOBILE BUSINESSES, AND A $50 MILLION REDUCTION IN RESERVES RELATED TO THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 (ALSO DUE TO LOWER THAN

EXPECTED CLAIM FREQUENCY). CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $249 MILLION IN 2003 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN COMPARABLE LOSSES OF $84 MILLION IN 2002. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN BOTH YEARS WERE DRIVEN BY NUMEROUS STORMS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. LOSSES IN 2003

ALSO REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF HURRICANE ISABEL AND WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA.

COMMISSIONS THAT RESULTED FROM IMPROVED UNDERWRITING RESULTS.

THE 4.5 POINT IMPROVEMENT IN THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OVER 2002 WAS DUE TO RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES THAT EXCEEDED LOSS COST TRENDS, CONTINUED REDUCED LEVELS OF NON-CATASTROPHE PROPERTY CLAIM FREQUENCY AND HIGHER FAVORABLE

THE MERGER. THAT AMOUNT WAS NET OF THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF $36 MILLION OF THE AMORTIZATION OF THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO DEBT RECORDED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE 2004 TOTAL ALSO INCLUDED $9 MILLION OF CHARGES RELATED TO THE MERGER THAT

WERE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER.

INTEREST EXPENSE AND

OTHER IN 2003 INCREASED $9 MILLION, AFTER TAX, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST COSTS. AFTER-TAX INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $105 MILLION IN 2003 COMPARED TO $100 MILLION IN 2002. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN ONE

TIME COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER REFINANCING ACTIVITIES THAT LOWERED AVERAGE INTEREST COSTS, BUT RESULTED IN HIGHER LEVELS OF TEMPORARY DEBT. TEMPORARY FINANCING INCLUDED $550 MILLION FIRST OBTAINED IN DECEMBER 2002 IN

CONNECTION WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER 2002 ASBESTOS RESERVE STRENGTHENING AND $1.40 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES ISSUED ON MARCH 11, 2003. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THESE SENIOR NOTES WERE USED TO PREPAY AND REFINANCE A $500 MILLION NOTE TO

CITIGROUP ON MARCH 11, 2003, AND TO REDEEM $900 MILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES ON APRIL 9, 2003. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SEE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND

INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS BEING TENDERED TO THE COMPANY BY THE COMPANYS POLICYHOLDERS

(WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY) INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANYS POLICYHOLDERS BY INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT APPEAR TO BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE. FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE INCREASES INCLUDE MORE INTENSIVE

ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS, THE INCREASING FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON NEW AND PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS AND ENTITIES SEEKING BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS A RESULT OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO

THE INCREASE IN CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES BY INITIALLY DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING THE

COMPANY. BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS ARE ALSO CAUSING INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT THAT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. RECENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN

PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION HAVE THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET. THIS TREND,

ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON NEW AND PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE INCREASE IN LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE PAYMENTS EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SEES, AS AN EMERGING TREND, AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANYS

ASBESTOS-RELATED

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF THE EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURANCE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS

ALONG WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS WHO HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, ACANDS, INC., WHO IN SOME INSTANCES

HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE AS DESCRIBED GENERALLY IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH. (ALSO SEE PART IITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS). THESE TRENDS ARE

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH 2005. AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE FROM ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

IN SOME INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS CONTINUE TO ASSERT THAT THEIR CLAIMS FOR ASBESTOS-RELATED INSURANCE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO

AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE AND THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES OR WHETHER THE COMPANY

WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ASSERTING ADDITIONAL DEFENSES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN POLICYHOLDERS FAVOR AND OTHER ADDITIONAL COMPANY DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, THE COMPANYS COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE

WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THE CLAIMS FOR COVERAGE

NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS.

MANY COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH

POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE

RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. AS IN THE PAST, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN ADDITION, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY, CHALLENGING INSURERS CONDUCT IN RESPECT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS, AND, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, CLAIMS BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE FILING OF

OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL

THEORIES OF LIABILITY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THESE CLAIMS AND HAS RECEIVED FAVORABLE RULINGS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, TPC HAS ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE COURT IN

CONNECTION WITH THE PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY TPC IN THE JOHNS MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY COURT. IF THE RULINGS OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ARE AFFIRMED THROUGH THE APPELLATE PROCESS, THEN TPC WILL HAVE RESOLVED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PENDING CLAIMS AGAINST

IT OF THIS NATURE. (ALSO, SEE ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS).

BECAUSE EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER ON A POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS. IN THE COURSE OF THIS

EVALUATION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF EACH POLICYHOLDERS POTENTIAL LIABILITY;

THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF

NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM

SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM. WHEN THE GROSS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR INDEMNITY AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE IS DETERMINED FOR A POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY CALCULATES, BY EACH POLICY YEAR, A

CEDED REINSURANCE PROJECTION BASED ON ANY APPLICABLE FACULTATIVE AND TREATY REINSURANCE, PAST CEDED EXPERIENCE AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES. THE COMPANYS

EVALUATIONS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN ANY DATA FROM WHICH A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY PAYMENT MAY BE DETERMINED.

THE COMPANY ALSO COMPARES ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE, YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR

CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. NET ASBESTOS

LOSSES AND EXPENSES PAID IN 2004 WERE $301 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $452 MILLION IN 2003. APPROXIMATELY 22% IN 2004 AND 57% IN 2003 OF TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES

RELATE TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD LIMIT THE COMPANYS LIABILITY. THE DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF NET PAID SETTLEMENTS TO TOTAL PAID LOSSES IN 2004 PRIMARILY REFLECTED AN

INCREASE IN REINSURANCE BILLINGS IN 2004, WHICH RELATED TO GROSS PAYMENTS MADE IN PRIOR PERIODS. IN 2004, GROSS PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS TOTALED $199 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $289 MILLION IN 2003.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, NET ASBESTOS RESERVES TOTALED $3.93 BILLION,

PROVISION TO STRENGTHEN RESERVES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL GROUND-UP REVIEW OF ASBESTOS EXPOSURES. THAT REVIEW INCLUDED AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS

WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER BANKRUPTCIES, STATE JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. THE $922 MILLION PROVISION PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION COSTS AND ACTIVITY SURROUNDING PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS.

THE POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS CATEGORY INCLUDES STRUCTURED AGREEMENTS, COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS AND, WITH RESPECT TO TPC, WELLINGTON

ACCOUNTS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS (FOR A FULLER DESCRIPTION OF THESE MATTERS, SEE ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS) (COLLECTIVELY THE DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENT). RESERVES

ARE BASED ON THE EXPECTED PAYOUT FOR EACH POLICYHOLDER UNDER THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENT. STRUCTURED AGREEMENTS ARE ARRANGEMENTS UNDER WHICH POLICYHOLDERS AND/OR PLAINTIFFS AGREE TO FIXED FINANCIAL AMOUNTS TO BE PAID AT SCHEDULED TIMES. STRUCTURED

AGREEMENTS INCLUDE THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. (PPG). IN MAY 2002 THE COMPANY AGREED ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY THREE DOZEN OTHER INSURERS AND PPG ON KEY TERMS TO SETTLE ASBESTOS RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION UNDER

INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO PPG. THIS SETTLEMENT IS TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (THE PLAN) PROPOSED AS PART OF THE PITTSBURGH CORNING (PC) BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. THERE REMAIN A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES TO CONSUMMATION OF THE

SETTLEMENT INCLUDING THE FINAL EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS, COURT APPROVAL OF THE PC PLAN OVER PENDING OBJECTIONS, APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AND POSSIBLE APPEALS. PURSUANT TO THE PROPOSED PC PLAN, PC ALONG WITH ENUMERATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES (INCLUDING

PPG AND CORNING) ARE TO RECEIVE THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE FROM CERTAIN ASBESTOS RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. A RECENT RULING BY THE THIRD CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS IN THE

IN RE COMBUSTION ENGINEERING,

INC.

(CE) MATTER MAY IMPACT THE SCOPE OF RELIEF THAT IS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO THE DEBTOR AND OTHER PLAN PROPONENTS. AS A RESULT, THE PC BANKRUPTCY COURT HAS SOUGHT ADDITIONAL BRIEFING ON THE IMPACT OF THE CE DECISION ON THE PROPOSED

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PC PLAN. ORAL ARGUMENT IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE ON MARCH 16, 2005. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHAT EFFECT THE CE DECISION MAY HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THE

BANKRUPTCY COURTS APPROVAL OF THE CURRENT PLAN. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT COMPLETION OF THE SETTLEMENT IS REASONABLY LIKELY ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW OR WHEN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WILL RULE ON THE OUTSTANDING OBJECTIONS OR HOW

AN APPELLATE COURT MAY RULE IN THE EVENT OF AN APPEAL. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANYS SINGLE PAYMENT CONTRIBUTION PURSUANT TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $395 MILLION AFTER REINSURANCE WILL BE MADE IN CALENDAR YEAR 2005.

COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS REPRESENT AGREEMENTS WITH MAJOR POLICYHOLDERS ON SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE TO BE PROVIDED. PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL MAXIMUMS AND ARE ONLY MADE WHEN VALID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED. WELLINGTON

ACCOUNTS REFER TO THE 35 DEFENDANTS THAT ARE PARTIES TO A 1985 AGREEMENT SETTLING CERTAIN DISPUTES CONCERNING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEIR ASBESTOS CLAIMS. MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF THE WELLINGTON AGREEMENT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF COVERAGE IN PLACE

ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED ON SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE AND THE TERMS UNDER WHICH THE COVERAGE CAN BE ACCESSED. AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, TPC HAS ENTERED INTO THE DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENT WHICH IS

STILL SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES. IF THOSE CONTINGENCIES ARE MET, THEN TPC WILL PAY UP TO $502 MILLION, POSSIBLY IN CALENDAR YEAR 2005. ONE OF THE CONTINGENCIES INCLUDES AFFIRMANCE BY ALL APPELLATE COURTS OF THE ORDERS ENTERED BY THE

UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT WITH RESPECT TO THE DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENT. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW OR WHEN THE APPELLATE COURTS WILL RULE ON THE PENDING APPEALS. TEN NEW POLICYHOLDERS WERE ADDED TO THE POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS CATEGORY DURING 2004, INCLUDING SEVEN RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF SPC. DURING THE COURSE OF 2004, THE COMPANY MADE FINAL PAYMENTS TO FOUR POLICYHOLDERS, INCLUDING ONE THAT AROSE DURING THE YEAR.

OTHER POLICYHOLDERS WITH ACTIVE CLAIMS ARE IDENTIFIED AS HOME OFFICE REVIEW

OR FIELD OFFICE REVIEW POLICYHOLDERS. POLICYHOLDERS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR HOME OFFICE REVIEW BASED UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: AGGREGATE ULTIMATE EXPECTED PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED THRESHOLD (CURRENTLY $100,000), PERCEIVED LEVEL OF EXPOSURE,

NUMBER OF REPORTED CLAIMS, PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATIONS AND POTENTIAL NON-PRODUCT EXPOSURES, SIZE OF POLICYHOLDER AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD BY THE POLICYHOLDER. DURING 2004, THERE WERE 285 POLICYHOLDERS

ADDED TO THE HOME OFFICE REVIEW. THE ACQUISITION OF SPC ACCOUNTED FOR 222 OF THOSE POLICYHOLDERS, WHILE THE TPC COUNT INCREASED BY 63. PAID LOSSES FOR POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE REVIEW CATEGORY INCREASED BY $30 MILLION DURING THE YEAR,

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADDITION OF THE SPC POLICYHOLDERS TO THIS CATEGORY. ACCOUNTS UNDER FIELD OFFICE REVIEW INCREASED BY 444 POLICYHOLDERS OVER YEAR-END 2003. THE ACQUISITION OF SPC ACCOUNTED FOR 516 OF THOSE POLICYHOLDERS, WHILE THE TPC COUNT WAS

REDUCED BY 72.

ASSUMED REINSURANCE EXPOSURE PRIMARILY CONSISTS

OF REINSURANCE OF EXCESS COVERAGE, INCLUDING VARIOUS POOL PARTICIPATIONS. THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE EXPOSED TO U.S. ASBESTOS LIABILITIES THROUGH PARTICIPATIONS IN EXCESS INSURANCE POLICIES, QUOTA SHARE AND EXCESS OF LOSS

REINSURANCE POLICIES, AND RETROCESSION POLICIES, UNDERWRITTEN IN THE LONDON INSURANCE MARKET. DETAILS OF EXPOSURES UNDER THE REINSURANCE AND RETROCESSION POLICIES ARE IDENTIFIED ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY IS ADVISED BY THE RETROCEDANT.

IN ADDITION TO INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED (IBNR), AMOUNTS CONTAINED IN THE

RESERVES FOR SPECIFIC POLICYHOLDERS OR GROUPS OF POLICYHOLDERS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED AN UNALLOCATED IBNR RESERVE FOR FURTHER ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS, NEW CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS REPORTING CLAIMS

FOR THE FIRST TIME AND POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH THERE IS, OR MAY BE, LITIGATION AND DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY. DURING 2004, RECLASSIFICATION OF RESERVES TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN THE

UNALLOCATED IBNR RESERVE OF $595 MILLION. THE DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENT ACCOUNTED FOR $502 MILLION OF THIS RECLASSIFICATION.

RESERVES.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT

THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS

SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN

LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS HAVE INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE

DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE MID-1970S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT BY THE

CLAIMANT FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, APPROXIMATELY 71% OF THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $456 MILLION) IS CARRIED IN A BULK RESERVE AND INCLUDES UNRESOLVED

AND INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY SPECIFIC CLAIMS AS WELL AS FOR THE ANTICIPATED COST OF COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTES RELATING TO THESE CLAIMS. THE BALANCE, APPROXIMATELY 29% OF THE NET

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $185 MILLION), CONSISTS OF CASE RESERVES. THE BULK RESERVE THE COMPANY CARRIES IS ESTABLISHED AND ADJUSTED BASED UPON THE AGGREGATE VOLUME OF IN-PROCESS ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE IN

RESOLVING THOSE CLAIMS.

THE RESOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPOSURES BY THE COMPANY GENERALLY OCCURS BY SETTLEMENT ON A POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS AS OPPOSED TO A CLAIM-BY-CLAIM BASIS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY STRIVES TO EXTINGUISH ANY OBLIGATIONS IT MAY HAVE UNDER ANY POLICY ISSUED TO THE

POLICYHOLDER FOR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXTINGUISH ANY PENDING COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTE WITH THE POLICYHOLDER. THIS FORM OF SETTLEMENT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A BUY-BACK OF POLICIES FOR FUTURE

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE AGREEMENTS HAVE ALSO EXTINGUISHED ANY INSURANCE OBLIGATION WHICH THE COMPANY MAY HAVE FOR OTHER CLAIMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ASBESTOS AND OTHER CUMULATIVE INJURY CLAIMS. THE COMPANY AND ITS

POLICYHOLDERS MAY ALSO AGREE TO SETTLEMENTS WHICH EXTINGUISH ANY FUTURE LIABILITY ARISING FROM KNOWN SPECIFIED SITES OR CLAIMS. PROVISIONS OF THESE AGREEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE APPROPRIATE INDEMNITIES AND HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANYS GENERAL PURPOSE IN EXECUTING THESE AGREEMENTS IS TO REDUCE THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE AND ELIMINATE THE RISKS PRESENTED BY COVERAGE LITIGATION WITH THE POLICYHOLDER AND RELATED COSTS.

IN ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE

PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF SIMILAR

EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE ALLEGATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF

THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE,

INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO

ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES.

THERE HAVE BEEN JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS THAT, IN SOME CASES, HAVE BEEN UNFAVORABLE TO THE INDUSTRY AND THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, PAYMENTS FOR LOSS AND ALLOCATED LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES HAVE INCREASED OVER PAST YEARS. IN ITS REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERED: THE ADEQUACY OF RESERVES FOR PAST SETTLEMENTS; CHANGING JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE TRENDS; THE POTENTIAL FOR POLICYHOLDERS WITH SMALLER EXPOSURES TO BE NAMED IN NEW CLEAN-UP ACTION FOR BOTH ON- AND OFF-SITE WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES; THE

POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT AND ADDITIONAL NEW CLAIMS BEYOND PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS; AND THE POTENTIAL HIGHER COSTS FOR NEW SETTLEMENTS. BASED ON THESE TRENDS, DEVELOPMENTS AND MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS IBNR RESERVES

ACCORDINGLY. IN 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $290 MILLION, NET OF REINSURANCE, TO INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES DUE TO REVISED ESTIMATES OF COSTS RELATED TO RECENT SETTLEMENT INITIATIVES.

THE DURATION OF THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW OF THESE CLAIMS

AND THE EXTENT OF TIME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE ESTIMATE, IF ANY, OF THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM TO THE COMPANY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND ARE DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE COOPERATION OF

THE POLICYHOLDER IN PROVIDING CLAIM INFORMATION, THE PACE OF UNDERLYING LITIGATION OR CLAIM PROCESSES, THE PACE OF

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

COVERAGE LITIGATION BETWEEN THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY TO NEGOTIATE, IF APPROPRIATE, A

RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE PERTAINING TO THESE CLAIMS. BECAUSE THESE FACTORS VARY FROM CLAIM-TO-CLAIM AND POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY CANNOT PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE OF THE DURATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM. HOWEVER, BASED UPON THE

COMPANYS EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THESE CLAIMS, THE DURATION MAY VARY FROM MONTHS TO SEVERAL YEARS.

THE COMPANYS REVIEW OF POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME HAS INDICATED THAT THEY ARE LOWER IN SEVERITY. THESE POLICYHOLDERS

GENERALLY PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE LOWER TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE UTILIZING RISK-BASED ANALYSIS AND MORE EFFICIENT CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE

ANTICIPATED SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN MATTERS AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AS A RESULT OF THE

PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT.

HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN MAJOR LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY

VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHICH CANNOT NOW BE ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR

ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE COMPANYS PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SEES, AS AN EMERGING TREND, AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF THE

EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURANCE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT

AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE

ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LARGE COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN

BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS RESERVES, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANNUAL GROUND-UP REVIEW OF ASBESTOS

POLICYHOLDERS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ANNUAL GROUND-UP REVIEW, WHICH INCLUDED THE ASBESTOS LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004.

ALSO SEE ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

BECAUSE OF

THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR

INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

THE COMPANYS INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 TOTALED $64.71 BILLION, INCLUDING $477 MILLION OF SECURITIES IN

PROCESS OF SETTLEMENT, OF WHICH 92% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, 1% IN COMMON STOCKS AND OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES, 1% IN MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE AND 6% IN OTHER INVESTMENTS. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT ON INVESTED ASSETS

OF SECURITIES LENDING, UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, RECEIVABLES FOR INVESTMENT SALES AND PAYABLES ON INVESTMENT PURCHASES, THE PRETAX AVERAGE YIELD WAS 4.8%, 5.3% AND 6.0% AND THE AFTER TAX AVERAGE YIELD WAS 3.7%, 4.0% AND 4.4% FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

BECAUSE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS TO FUND FUTURE CLAIMS PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY. THE COMPANYS FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 TOTALED $54.26 BILLION,

COMPRISING $53.93 BILLION OF PUBLICLY TRADED FIXED MATURITIES AND $328 MILLION OF PRIVATE FIXED MATURITIES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE QUALITY RATINGS OF THE COMPANYS PUBLICLY TRADED FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AND PRIVATE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 WERE AA2 AND A3, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT THAT DATE WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.78 BILLION OF BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES. DURING 2004, HOLDINGS OF TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES WERE INCREASED TO $26.58

BILLION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR RELATIVELY HIGH CREDIT QUALITY AND ATTRACTIVE AFTER-TAX YIELDS. THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WAS 4.1 YEARS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 (4.4 YEARS

EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS), UNCHANGED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2003.

THE COMPANY MAKES

INVESTMENTS IN COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) THAT TYPICALLY HAVE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY, OFFER GOOD LIQUIDITY, AND ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE AN ADVANTAGE IN YIELD COMPARED TO U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT STRATEGY

IS TO PURCHASE CMO TRANCHES WHICH OFFER THE MOST FAVORABLE RETURN GIVEN THE RISKS INVOLVED. ONE SIGNIFICANT RISK EVALUATED IS PREPAYMENT SENSITIVITY. WHILE PREPAYMENT RISK (EITHER SHORTENING OR LENGTHENING OF DURATION) AND ITS EFFECT ON TOTAL RETURN

CANNOT BE FULLY CONTROLLED, PARTICULARLY WHEN INTEREST RATES MOVE DRAMATICALLY, THE INVESTMENT PROCESS GENERALLY FAVORS SECURITIES THAT CONTROL THIS RISK WITHIN EXPECTED INTEREST RATE RANGES. THE COMPANY DOES INVEST IN OTHER TYPES OF CMO TRANCHES IF

A CAREFUL ASSESSMENT INDICATES A FAVORABLE RISK/RETURN TRADEOFF. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PURCHASE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN CMOS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY HELD CMOS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $3.30 BILLION AND $3.06 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY

(EXCLUDING COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES OF $953 MILLION AND $875 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY). APPROXIMATELY 53% AND 60% OF THE COMPANYS CMO HOLDINGS ARE GUARANTEED BY OR FULLY COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES ISSUED BY GNMA, FNMA OR FHLMC AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HELD $4.66 BILLION AND $3.80 BILLION OF GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC OR FHA MORTGAGE-BACKED PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

VIRTUALLY ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE RATED AAA.

THE

COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF VENTURE CAPITAL, THROUGH DIRECT OWNERSHIP AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND TRADING SECURITIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT

TO MORE VOLATILITY THAN THE COMPANYS FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, BUT HISTORICALLY HAVE PROVIDED A HIGHER RETURN. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENTS WAS $3.56 BILLION.



$40 MILLION IN ITS VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO ON 16 HOLDINGS. THREE OF THE HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO NEW FINANCINGS AT LESS THAN FAVORABLE RATES. FIVE HOLDINGS EXPERIENCED

FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC DETERIORATION (CHARACTERIZED BY LESS THAN EXPECTED REVENUES OR A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN PRODUCT). EIGHT OF THE HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO THE IMPENDING SALE, LIQUIDATION OR SHUTDOWN OF THE ENTITY. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO

EVALUATE CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MARKET THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT THE VALUATION OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS.



$10 MILLION IN ITS REAL ESTATE AND OTHER HOLDINGS. THE LOSSES RECORDED WERE THE RESULT OF FALLING RENTAL RATES AND OCCUPANCIES IN THREE OF THE COMPANYS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT

HOLDINGS.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $65 MILLION IN THE FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO DURING 2003 RELATED TO VARIOUS ISSUERS, WITH $8 MILLION DUE TO COMPANIES FILING BANKRUPTCY AND THE REMAINDER RELATED TO CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUERS

DETERIORATED FINANCIAL POSITION.

FOR PUBLICLY TRADED

SECURITIES, THE AMOUNTS OF THE IMPAIRMENTS WERE RECOGNIZED BY WRITING DOWN THE INVESTMENTS TO QUOTED MARKET PRICES. FOR NON-PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES, IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED BY WRITING DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, AS

DETERMINED DURING THE COMPANYS QUARTERLY INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS.

THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE IMPAIRMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE DID NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT OTHER INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENTS HELD DURING 2004 OR 2003.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT THE PRICES OF THE SECURITIES IDENTIFIED ABOVE WERE TEMPORARILY DEPRESSED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF MARKET DISLOCATION AND GENERALLY POOR CYCLICAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FURTHER, UNREALIZED LOSSES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 REPRESENT LESS THAN 1% OF

THE PORTFOLIO, AND, THEREFORE, ANY IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION WOULD NOT BE SIGNIFICANT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, NON-INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES COMPRISED 3% OF THE COMPANYS FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. INCLUDED IN THOSE CATEGORIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 WERE SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION THAT, IN THE AGGREGATE, HAD AN AMORTIZED COST OF $321 MILLION AND A FAIR VALUE OF $314 MILLION, RESULTING IN A NET PRETAX UNREALIZED LOSS OF $7 MILLION. THESE SECURITIES IN AN

UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION REPRESENTED LESS THAN 1% OF THE TOTAL AMORTIZED COST AND LESS THAN 1% OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AND ACCOUNTED FOR 3% OF THE TOTAL PRETAX UNREALIZED LOSS IN THE FIXED INCOME

PORTFOLIO.

RESULTING PURCHASES

AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON CASH REQUIREMENTS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES INVESTMENTS TO BE SOLD TO ACHIEVE ITS PRIMARY INVESTMENT GOALS OF ASSURING THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO MEET POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS TO OPTIMIZE INVESTMENT RETURNS, GIVEN THESE OBLIGATIONS.

OUTLOOK

THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE IS TO ENHANCE ITS POSITION AS A CONSISTENTLY PROFITABLE MARKET LEADER AND A COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDER OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES. A VARIETY OF FACTORS

CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET AND THE COMPANYS CORE BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR 2005, INCLUDING THE MODERATING LEVEL OF PRICE INCREASES IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE, THE INCREASING COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT ACROSS ALL

OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES, LOSS COST TRENDS (INCLUDING MEDICAL INFLATION AND AUTO LOSS COSTS), ASBESTOS-RELATED DEVELOPMENTS AND RISING REINSURANCE AND LITIGATION COSTS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE SECTOR TO CONTINUE TO BE QUITE COMPETITIVE

THROUGHOUT 2005. COMMERCIAL PRICING AT THE END OF 2004 HAD DECLINED TO THE LOW SINGLE-DIGIT RANGE AND MAY TURN NEGATIVE IN 2005 FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN SOME MARKETS. IN GENERAL, THE PRICING ENVIRONMENT IN THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE

BETTER THAN IN COMMERCIAL, LARGELY DUE TO THE SPECIALIZED NATURE OF THE SPECIALTY BUSINESSES. WITHIN PERSONAL, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO SEE INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION IN THE AUTO SEGMENT, WHILE THE HOMEOWNERS SEGMENT IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN STABLE.

THE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED UNPRECEDENTED LOW LEVELS OF CLAIM

FREQUENCY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, A TREND THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE MATERIALLY IN 2005. SEVERITY TREND, THE OTHER COMPONENT OF LOSS TREND, IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN STABLE. NEVERTHELESS, WITH CONTINUED PRESSURE ON PRICING, IT IS

LIKELY THAT MARGINS WILL CONTRACT IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IN 2005, ALBEIT FROM VERY STRONG LEVELS.

CHANGES IN THE GENERAL INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AFFECT THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW INVESTMENTS. WHILE A RISING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT ENHANCES THE

RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, IT REDUCES THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF GAINS ON DISPOSITION. A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW INVESTMENTS BUT

INCREASES THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING INVESTMENTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS ON DISPOSITION. IN 2004, INTEREST RATES BEGAN TO INCREASE AFTER REACHING THEIR LOWEST LEVELS SINCE THE 1950S IN 2003. CONSEQUENTLY, YIELDS

AVAILABLE ON NEW INVESTMENTS BEGAN TO GROW, BUT REMAINED BELOW THE EXISTING PORTFOLIOS AVERAGE BOOK YIELD. THE CONTINUATION OF AN UPWARD TREND IN INTEREST RATES IN 2005 WOULD FAVORABLY IMPACT THE AVERAGE BOOK YIELD OF THE COMPANYS FIXED

INCOME HOLDINGS.

IN JANUARY 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT

IT WILL EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES TO DIVEST ITS MAJORITY OWNERSHIP POSITION IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, THEREBY PROVIDING THE COMPANY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE ITS FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO REALIZE ITS TARGETED MERGER-RELATED CUMULATIVE EXPENSE

SAVINGS OF $350 MILLION BY THE END OF 2005 AND $450 MILLION BY THE END OF 2006. A PORTION OF THESE SAVINGS ARE EXPECTED BE REDEPLOYED TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS REQUIRED BY VARIOUS STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT

TO ASSESSMENTS FROM STATE-ADMINISTERED GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS, SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND SIMILAR ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, THESE ASSESSMENTS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

SOME SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND LITIGATION

ISSUES HAVE LED TO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROPOSALS AIMED AT ADDRESSING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF SOME TYPES OF INSURANCE AS WELL AS THE CLAIM AND COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS OF INSURERS. WHILE MOST OF THESE PROVISIONS HAVE

FAILED TO BECOME LAW, THESE INITIATIVES MAY CONTINUE AS LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS TRY TO RESPOND TO PUBLIC AVAILABILITY, AFFORDABILITY AND CLAIM CONCERNS AND THE RESULTING LAWS, IF ANY, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO WRITE

BUSINESS WITH APPROPRIATE RETURNS.

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, THE

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 (THE TERRORISM ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW AND ESTABLISHED THE TERRORISM INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM), A TEMPORARY FEDERAL PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THAT PROVIDES FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN INTEREST. IN ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT

THAT IS CERTIFIED AS AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF TREASURY. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE TERRORISM ACT. THE TERRORISM ACT GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT ALL COMMERCIAL

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM TERMINATES ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR 90% OF SUBJECT

LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP. IN EACH CASE, THE DEDUCTIBLE PERCENTAGE IS APPLIED TO THE INSURERS DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS FROM THE CALENDAR YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE YEAR. THE DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE

PROGRAM WAS 7% FOR 2003, 10% FOR 2004 AND IS 15% FOR 2005. THE PROGRAM ALSO CONTAINS AN ANNUAL CAP THAT LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE $100 BILLION

AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE U.S. TREASURY AND AN INSURER THAT HAS MET ITS DEDUCTIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM YEAR IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES (OR PORTION THEREOF) THAT EXCEED THE $100 BILLION CAP. THE

COMPANYS ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM IS $2.51 BILLION FOR 2005. THE COMPANY HAD NO TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES IN 2004 OR 2003. IF THE PROGRAM IS NOT RENEWED FOR PERIODS AFTER JANUARY 1, 2006, THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM WILL

NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM SUBJECT ONLY TO THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE POLICIES.

WHILE THE TERRORISM ACT PROVIDES A FEDERALLY-FUNDED BACKSTOP FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS, IT ALSO

REQUIRES THAT INSURERS IMMEDIATELY BEGIN OFFERING COVERAGE FOR INSURED LOSSES CAUSED BY ACTS OF TERRORISM. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY POLICIES ALREADY INCLUDED SUCH COVERAGE, ALTHOUGH EXCLUSIONS WERE ADDED TO

HIGHER-RISK POLICYHOLDERS AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. FOR THOSE RISKS CONSIDERED HIGHER-RISK, SUCH AS LANDMARK BUILDINGS OR HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF EMPLOYEES IN ONE LOCATION, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EITHER DECLINE TO OFFER A RENEWAL OR WILL OFFER

COVERAGE FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY ACTS OF TERRORISM ON A LIMITED BASIS, WITH AN EXPLICIT CHARGE FOR THE COVERAGE.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL PROPOSALS TO REQUIRE ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS TO DEMONSTRATE AN ASBESTOS ILLNESS. AT THIS

TIME IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OR TIMING OF SUCH PROPOSALS BEING ENACTED OR THE EFFECT IF THEY ARE ENACTED. THE COMPANYS ONGOING ANALYSIS OF ITS ASBESTOS RESERVES DID NOT ASSUME THE ADOPTION OF ANY ASBESTOS REFORMS. FOR

INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTLOOK WITH RESPECT TO ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND LIABILITIES SEE ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF A COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO MEET THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CASH

REQUIREMENTS OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ASSET MATURITIES AND INCOME RECEIVED ON INVESTMENTS. CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS

USED PRIMARILY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. CATASTROPHE CLAIMS, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, MAY CREATE INCREASED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF

REINSURANCE RECOVERIES MAY BE AFFECTED BY REINSURER SOLVENCY AND INCREASINGLY BY REINSURANCE COVERAGE DISPUTES. ADDITIONALLY, RECENT INCREASES IN ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIM PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS ARISING OUT OF

LITIGATION, MAY ALSO RESULT IN INCREASED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANYS FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS WILL BE MET FROM ALL OF THE ABOVE SOURCES.

NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $5.24 BILLION, $3.83

BILLION AND $2.93 BILLION IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. CASH FLOWS IN 2004 INCLUDED $867 MILLION IN CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED PURSUANT TO THE COMMUTATION OF SPECIFIC REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY. CASH FLOWS

IN 2004 ALSO BENEFITED FROM PREMIUM RATE AND VOLUME INCREASES. THE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER DID NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT YEAR-TO-DATE 2004 CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY UTILIZED $550 MILLION OF NET OPERATING LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS (NOL) DURING 2004, THEREBY REDUCING CURRENT REGULAR TAX PAYMENTS BY $193 MILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD SIGNIFICANT NOLS AVAILABLE TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING NOLS.

NET CASH FLOWS

PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2003 BENEFITED FROM PREMIUM RATE INCREASES AND THE RECEIPT OF $361 MILLION FROM CITIGROUP RELATED TO RECOVERIES UNDER THE ASBESTOS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 AND $531 MILLION OF FEDERAL

INCOME TAXES REFUNDED FROM THE COMPANYS NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYBACK.

NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL THREE YEARS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PAYMENTS FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND, IN 2004, FOR REINSURANCE, HEALTH CARE AND CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL

RUNOFF OPERATIONS. INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS STRUCTURED AGREEMENT COMPONENT OF ASBESTOS LOSS RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 WAS $395 MILLION (NET OF REINSURANCE) FOR THE COMPANYS SINGLE PAYMENT CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT

RELATED TO PPG, AND $502 MILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS. ALTHOUGH EACH OF THESE SETTLEMENTS IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES OR FINAL ORDERS AND RELIEF AS PREVIOUSLY

DISCUSSED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS WILL BE PAID IN 2005.

NET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $4.79 BILLION, $2.48 BILLION AND $2.27 BILLION IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN 2004 CORRESPONDS TO THE INCREASE IN OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS,

WHICH WERE INVESTED PREDOMINANTLY IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES. IN 2003, CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY SALES OF SECURITIES TO FUND NET PAYMENT ACTIVITY RELATED TO DEBT AND JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES HELD BY

SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS OF $772 MILLION. THE 2002 NET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED INVESTING OF NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE RECEIPT OF $4.09 BILLION FROM THE FIRST QUARTER 2002 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND

THE CONCURRENT ISSUANCE OF $867 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REPAYMENT OF $6.35 BILLION OF NOTES PAYABLE TO A FORMER AFFILIATE.

THE MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY INTERMEDIATE-TERM TAXABLE U.S.

GOVERNMENT, CORPORATE AND MORTGAGE BACKED BONDS AND TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES ARE EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE

FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE COMPANYS INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT OF THE DURATION OF THE FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO GENERALLY PRODUCES A DURATION THAT EXCEEDS THE DURATION OF THE COMPANYS NET

INSURANCE LIABILITIES. AS THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOCUSES ON ASSET AND LIABILITY DURATIONS, AND NOT SPECIFIC CASH FLOWS, ASSET SALES MAY BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY OBLIGATIONS AND/OR REBALANCE ASSET PORTFOLIOS. THE AVERAGE DURATION OF

FIXED MATURITIES AND SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WAS 4.1 YEARS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, UNCHANGED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2003.

83

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE COMPANY ALSO INVESTS MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, VENTURE CAPITAL AND REAL ESTATE.

THESE INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT ALSO INVOLVE VARYING DEGREES OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND LESS LIQUIDITY.

THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE COMPANYS ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS IS TO SATISFY THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND MANAGE

THE INTEREST RATE RISK EMBEDDED IN THOSE INSURANCE LIABILITIES. GENERALLY, THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANYS FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO ADEQUATELY FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EXACT CASH FLOW MATCH IN EACH PERIOD, THE SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE BY WHICH THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES PROVIDES ASSURANCE OF THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO FUND THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS THROUGH THE SALE OF SECURITIES OR A RESTRUCTURING OF THE PORTFOLIO, IF NECESSARY, WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING ITS ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT OF

SELLING SECURITIES BEFORE ANTICIPATED OR THE USE OF CREDIT FACILITIES TO PAY FOR POLICYHOLDER LIABILITIES, IF NECESSARY, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON FUTURE LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, TOTAL CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTED ASSETS OF $159

MILLION WERE HELD AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL. THESE LIQUID ASSETS WERE PRIMARILY FUNDED BY DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM THE COMPANYS OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES. THESE LIQUID ASSETS, COMBINED WITH OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS AVAILABLE, PRIMARILY ADDITIONAL

DIVIDENDS FROM THE COMPANYS OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, ARE CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY. THESE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE PRIMARILY, SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND DEBT SERVICE.

NET CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $546 MILLION, $1.10

BILLION AND $800 MILLION IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2004 OUTFLOWS WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS OF $642 MILLION. NET MATURITIES AND RETIREMENTS OF DEBT, INCLUDING THE REPURCHASE OF CIRIS

OUTSTANDING NOTES, TOTALED $75 MILLION IN 2004. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED THE MINORITY INTEREST IN CIRI DURING THE SECOND QUARTER FOR A TOTAL COST OF $76 MILLION.

CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2003 WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REDEMPTION OF $900 MILLION AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES HELD BY SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS, THE REPAYMENT OF $700 MILLION OF NOTES PAYABLE TO A FORMER AFFILIATE AND THE REPAYMENT OF $550 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT. FUNDS USED IN THESE REPAYMENTS WERE

PRIMARILY PROVIDED BY THE COMPANYS ISSUANCE OF $1.40 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES IN MARCH 2003 AND BY CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THESE REFINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE INITIATED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF LOWERING THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE

ON THE COMPANYS TOTAL OUTSTANDING DEBT. ALSO REFLECTED IN 2003 WAS THE ISSUANCE OF $550 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM FLOATING RATE NOTES WHICH WERE USED TO REPAY THE $550 MILLION PROMISSORY NOTE DUE IN JANUARY 2004. NET CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING

ACTIVITIES IN 2003 ALSO INCLUDED DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS OF $282 MILLION. THE 2002 CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES REFLECTS THE REPAYMENT OF $6.35 BILLION OF NOTES PAYABLE TO CITIGROUP. THESE PAYMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

RECEIPT OF $4.09 BILLION FROM THE FIRST QUARTER 2002 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND THE ISSUANCE OF $917 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE.

THE COMPANY PAID $636 MILLION OF COMMON DIVIDENDS IN 2004, COMPRISED OF REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS TOTALING $522 MILLION AND $114 MILLION THAT HAD BEEN

DECLARED BY SPC PRIOR TO THE MERGER. THAT AMOUNT CONSISTED OF SPCS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AT A RATE OF $0.29 PER SHARE ($66 MILLION), AND A SPECIAL $0.21 PER SHARE ($48 MILLION) DIVIDEND RELATED TO THE MERGER. THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND DECLARED

BY SPC PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER WAS DESIGNED TO RESULT IN THE HOLDERS OF SPCS COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO THE MERGER RECEIVING AGGREGATE DIVIDENDS WITH RECORD DATES IN 2004 OF $1.16 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS SPCS INDICATED ANNUAL DIVIDEND

RATE PRIOR TO THE MERGER. ON JANUARY 26, 2005, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.22 PER SHARE, PAYABLE MARCH 31, 2005 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON MARCH 10, 2005.

IN 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 0.4 MILLION AND 0.8 MILLION SHARES (AS

ADJUSTED FOR THE MERGER), RESPECTIVELY, OF COMMON STOCK FROM EMPLOYEES AS TREASURY STOCK PRIMARILY TO COVER PAYROLL WITHHOLDING TAXES IN CONNECTION WITH THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS. IN 2003, TPC REPURCHASED

APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION SHARES (AS ADJUSTED FOR THE MERGER) OF COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $40 MILLION, REPRESENTING THE ACQUISITION OF SHARES UNDER A REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT HAD BEEN APPROVED BY TPCS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. TPCS

REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS TERMINATED UPON COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS TO HOLDERS OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK WILL BE AT

THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, EARNINGS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY

CONSTRAINTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEEMS RELEVANT. DIVIDENDS WOULD BE PAID BY THE COMPANY ONLY IF DECLARED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OUT OF FUNDS LEGALLY AVAILABLE, SUBJECT TO ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO THE

COMPANY.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE MERGER ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SPCS OUTSTANDING DEBT, WHICH HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF $3.68 BILLION AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PURCHASE ACCOUNTING, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SPC DEBT ACQUIRED WAS ADJUSTED TO

MARKET VALUE AS OF APRIL 1, 2004 USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD, WHICH RESULTED IN A $301 MILLION ADJUSTMENT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED DEBT OUTSTANDING. THAT FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE

REMAINING LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ACQUIRED. THAT AMORTIZATION, WHICH TOTALED $56 MILLION IN 2004, REDUCED REPORTED INTEREST EXPENSE.

THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS ON ITS CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES FOR A

PERIOD NOT EXCEEDING 20 CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY INTEREST PERIODS. IF THE COMPANY ELECTS TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE NOTES, IT WILL NOT BE PERMITTED, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK DURING A DEFERRAL PERIOD.

IN FEBRUARY 2002, TPC PAID A DIVIDEND OF $1.00 BILLION TO

CITIGROUP IN THE FORM OF A NON-INTEREST BEARING NOTE PAYABLE ON DECEMBER 31, 2002. ON DECEMBER 31, 2002, THIS NOTE WAS REPAID IN ITS ENTIRETY. ALSO IN FEBRUARY 2002, TPC PAID AN ADDITIONAL DIVIDEND OF $3.70 BILLION TO CITIGROUP IN THE FORM OF A NOTE

PAYABLE IN TWO INSTALLMENTS. THIS NOTE WAS SUBSTANTIALLY PREPAID FOLLOWING THE OFFERINGS. THE BALANCE OF $150 MILLION WAS DUE ON MAY 9, 2004. THIS NOTE WAS PREPAID ON MAY 8, 2002. IN MARCH 2002, TPC PAID A DIVIDEND OF $395 MILLION TO CITIGROUP IN

THE FORM OF A NOTE. THIS NOTE WAS PREPAID FOLLOWING THE OFFERINGS.

IN MARCH 2002, TPC ISSUED $893 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.5% CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES WHICH WILL MATURE ON APRIL 15, 2032, UNLESS EARLIER REDEEMED, REPURCHASED OR CONVERTED. INTEREST IS PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN

ARREARS. SEE NOTE 10 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION.

IN AUGUST 2002, CIRI ISSUED $50 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.0% CONVERTIBLE NOTES WHICH WERE TO MATURE ON DECEMBER 31, 2032 UNLESS EARLIER

REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED. THE COMPANY REPURCHASED THESE NOTES IN 2004. SEE NOTE 10 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

IN DECEMBER 2002, TPC ENTERED INTO A LOAN AGREEMENT WITH AN UNAFFILIATED LENDER AND BORROWED $550 MILLION UNDER A PROMISSORY

NOTE DUE IN JANUARY 2004. THE PROMISSORY NOTE CARRIED A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE OF LIBOR PLUS 25 BASIS POINTS PER ANNUM. ON FEBRUARY 5, 2003, TPC ISSUED $550 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE IN FEBRUARY 2004. THE PROCEEDS FROM THESE NOTES WERE USED

TO REPAY THE $550 MILLION DUE ON THE PROMISSORY NOTE. THE FLOATING RATE NOTES ALSO CARRIED A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE OF LIBOR PLUS 25 BASIS POINTS PER ANNUM. ON MARCH 14, 2003 AND JUNE 17, 2003, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED $75 MILLION AND $24 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THE FLOATING RATE NOTES AT PAR PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. THE REMAINING $451 MILLION WERE REPAID ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2003.

ON MARCH 11, 2003, TPC ISSUED $1.40 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES COMPRISING $400 MILLION OF 3.75% SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2008, $500 MILLION OF 5.00% SENIOR

NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2013 AND $500 MILLION OF 6.375% SENIOR NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2033. THE NOTES PAY INTEREST SEMI-ANNUALLY ON MARCH 15 AND SEPTEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR, BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 15, 2003, ARE SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND RANK EQUALLY WITH

ALL OF TPCS OTHER SENIOR UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS. TPC MAY REDEEM SOME OR ALL OF THE NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY BY PAYING A MAKE-WHOLE PREMIUM BASED ON U.S. TREASURY RATES. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE NOTES WERE CONTRIBUTED

TO ITS PRIMARY SUBSIDIARY, TIGHI, SO THAT TIGHI COULD PREPAY AND REFINANCE $500 MILLION OF 3.60% INDEBTEDNESS TO CITIGROUP AND TO REDEEM $900 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF TIGHIS 8.00% TO 8.08% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES HELD

BY SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS. THESE TRUSTS, IN TURN, USED THESE FUNDS TO REDEEM $900 MILLION OF PREFERRED CAPITAL SECURITIES ON APRIL 9, 2003.

THESE SENIOR NOTES WERE SOLD TO QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS AS DEFINED UNDER RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE SECURITIES ACT) AND

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN RELIANCE ON REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. ACCORDINGLY, THE NOTES (THE RESTRICTED NOTES) WERE NOT REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND COULD NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT

PURSUANT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS. AS PART OF THIS OFFERING, TPC AGREED TO FILE A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT TO PERMIT THE EXCHANGE OF THE NOTES FOR REGISTERED NOTES (THE EXCHANGE NOTES) HAVING TERMS IDENTICAL TO THOSE OF THE

SENIOR NOTES DESCRIBED ABOVE (EXCHANGE OFFER). ON APRIL 14, 2003, TPC INITIATED THE EXCHANGE OFFER PURSUANT TO A FORM S-4 THAT WAS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. ACCORDINGLY, EACH SERIES OF EXCHANGE NOTES HAS BEEN REGISTERED

UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, AND THE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND REGISTRATION RIGHTS RELATING TO THE RESTRICTED NOTES DO NOT APPLY TO THE EXCHANGE NOTES.

IN JULY 2002, CONCURRENT WITH THE ISSUANCE OF 17.8 MILLION OF SPC COMMON SHARES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING, SPC

ISSUED 8.9 MILLION EQUITY UNITS, EACH HAVING A STATED AMOUNT OF $50, FOR GROSS CONSIDERATION OF $443 MILLION. EACH EQUITY UNIT INITIALLY CONSISTS OF A FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACT FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK (MATURING IN AUGUST 2005), AND AN

UNSECURED $50 SENIOR NOTE OF THE COMPANY (MATURING IN 2007). TOTAL ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE EQUITY UNITS ARE AT THE RATE OF 9.00%, CONSISTING OF INTEREST ON THE NOTE AT A RATE OF 5.25% AND FEE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FORWARD CONTRACT OF 3.75%. THE

FORWARD CONTRACT REQUIRES THE INVESTOR TO PURCHASE, FOR $50, A VARIABLE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF AUGUST 16, 2005. THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE PURCHASED WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON A FORMULA THAT

CONSIDERS THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK ON EACH OF 20 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS ENDING ON THE THIRD TRADING DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE SETTLEMENT DATE, IN RELATION TO THE $24.20 PER SHARE PRICE OF COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME

OF THE OFFERING. HAD THE SETTLEMENT DATE BEEN DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY 15 MILLION COMMON SHARES BASED ON THE AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THAT DATE. HOLDERS OF

THE EQUITY UNITS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A REQUIRED REMARKETING OF THE SENIOR NOTE COMPONENT. THE INITIAL REMARKETING DATE IS MAY 11, 2005. THE INTEREST RATE ON THE SENIOR NOTES WILL BE RESET ON THE DATE OF THE REMARKETING AND THEY

WILL BEAR INTEREST FROM THE DATE OF THE SETTLEMENT OF THE SUCCESSFUL REMARKETING AT THE RESET RATE.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY INTENDS TO REFINANCE CERTAIN MATURING DEBT IN 2005, INCLUDING THE $238 MILLION OF 7.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE APRIL 15, 2005, THE $79

MILLION OF 7.125% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 1, 2005, AND A PORTION OF THE MEDIUM TERM NOTES WITH MATURITIES IN 2005.

LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS.

EFFECTIVE APRIL 17, 2003, TPC ENTERED INTO THE FOLLOWING LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS WITH CITIBANK, A SUBSIDIARY OF

CITIGROUP, TPCS FORMER PARENT: (I) A $250 MILLION 45-MONTH REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT (THE 45-MONTH LINE OF CREDIT), AND (II) A $250 MILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT (THE TPC 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT AND, TOGETHER WITH THE 45-MONTH LINE OF

CREDIT, THE TPC LINES OF CREDIT). TPC MAY, WITH CITIBANKS CONSENT, EXTEND THE COMMITMENT OF THE 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT FOR ADDITIONAL 364-DAY PERIODS UNDER THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS. TPC HAS THE OPTION, PROVIDED THERE IS NO DEFAULT OR

EVENT OF DEFAULT, TO CONVERT OUTSTANDING ADVANCES UNDER THE 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT AT THE COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE TO A TERM LOAN MATURING NO LATER THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER, SPC WAS PARTY TO THE FOLLOWING LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS

WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS: (I) A $330 MILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT (THE SPC 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT), AND (II) A $270 MILLION 5-YEAR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT (THE 5-YEAR LINE OF CREDIT AND, TOGETHER WITH THE SPC 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT,

THE SPC LINES OF CREDIT). SPC MAY, WITH BANK SYNDICATE CONSENT, EXTEND THE COMMITMENT OF THE SPC 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT FOR ADDITIONAL 364-DAY PERIODS UNDER THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

AS A RESULT OF THE EXPIRATION OF THE SPC 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT AND THE TPC 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

A NEW $480 MILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE STA 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT) WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO THE FOLLOWING BANK CREDIT LINES: (I) THE $250 MILLION 45-MONTH LINE OF

CREDIT, (II) THE $270 MILLION 5-YEAR LINE OF CREDIT, AND (III) THE $480 MILLION STA 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT (COLLECTIVELY, THE COMPANY LINE OF CREDIT).

BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANY LINE OF CREDIT MAY BE MADE, AT THE COMPANYS OPTION, AT A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO EITHER THE LENDERS BASE

RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OR AT LIBOR PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN. THE COMPANY LINE OF CREDIT INCLUDES A COMMITMENT FEE AND, FOR ANY DATE ON WHICH ADVANCES EXCEED 50% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT FOR EACH LINE OF CREDIT, A UTILIZATION FEE. THE

APPLICABLE MARGIN AND THE RATES ON WHICH THE COMMITMENT FEE AND UTILIZATION FEE ARE BASED VARY BASED UPON THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM SENIOR UNSECURED NON-CREDIT-ENHANCED DEBT RATINGS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PURSUANT TO COVENANTS IN THE 5-YEAR LINE OF CREDIT AND STA 364-DAY LINE OF CREDIT, SUPPORTING THE

COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN AN EXCESS OF CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OVER GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF NOT LESS THAN $10 BILLION AT ALL TIMES. THE COMPANY MUST ALSO MAINTAIN A RATIO OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

DEBT TO THE SUM OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT PLUS CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OF NOT GREATER THAN 0.40 TO 1.00. PURSUANT TO THE COVENANTS IN THE 45-MONTH LINE OF CREDIT, TPC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MUST MAINTAIN, AS OF THE LAST DAY OF ANY FISCAL QUARTER,

COMBINED STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS IN EXCESS OF $5.50 BILLION AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT TO TOTAL CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL OF LESS THAN 0.45 TO 1.00. THERE WERE NO RATINGS BASED TRIGGERS FOR THE COMPANY LINE OF CREDIT. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND ALL OTHER COVENANTS RELATED TO ITS RESPECTIVE DEBT INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING.

AN EVENT OF DEFAULT WILL OCCUR IF THERE IS A CHANGE IN CONTROL (AS DEFINED IN THE 45-MONTH LINE OF CREDIT AND 5-YEAR LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS). THE

MERGER OF TPC AND SPC DID CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL FOR BOTH TPC AND SPC; HOWEVER, BOTH ENTITIES OBTAINED A WAIVER FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE BANKS OF THAT EVENT OF DEFAULT. THERE WERE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMPANY LINE OF CREDIT AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004.

ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED PAYMENTS

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE AMOUNT AND ESTIMATED FUTURE TIMING OF CLAIMS

AND CLAIM RELATED PAYMENTS. THE AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE EXACT LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE

ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST BASED ON THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY, FREQUENCY, LEGAL THEORIES OF

LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. VARIABLES IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. MANY OF THESE

ITEMS ARE NOT DIRECTLY QUANTIFIABLE, PARTICULARLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND THE TIME IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER. THE FUTURE CASH

FLOWS RELATED TO THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE TABLE BELOW, REQUIRED ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT (INCLUDING SEVERITY CONSIDERATIONS) AND TIMING. AMOUNT AND TIMING ARE FREQUENTLY ESTIMATED SEPARATELY. AN ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE CASH

THE AMOUNTS IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED TIMING OF FUTURE PAYMENTS FOR BOTH REPORTED AND

UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, NET OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THEREFORE, ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS INCLUDE CASH INFLOWS RELATED TO REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING. A REINSURANCE

AGREEMENT MUST INDEMNIFY THE INSURER FROM INSURANCE RISK, I.E., THE AGREEMENT MUST TRANSFER AMOUNT AND TIMING RISK, IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING. TIMING RISK IS TRANSFERRED IF THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES TIMELY REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE

REINSURER TO THE INSURER. SINCE THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH INFLOWS FROM SUCH REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS ARE HIGHLY CORRELATED TO THE UNDERLYING PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES BY THE INSURER, THE ANALYSIS ABOVE PRESENTS THE ESTIMATED

CASH OUTLAY FOR REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE, NET OF REINSURANCE. REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS THAT DO NOT TRANSFER BOTH AMOUNT AND

FOR BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN BY NON-U.S.

OPERATIONS, FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WERE TRANSLATED AT THE SPOT RATE ON DECEMBER 31, 2004.

THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE TABLE ARE PRESENTED ON A NOMINAL BASIS AND HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE TIME VALUE OF

MONEY. ACCORDINGLY, THE AMOUNTS ABOVE WILL DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES HAS BEEN DISCOUNTED IN THE BALANCE SHEET. (SEE NOTE 1 OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.)

(2)

WORKERS COMPENSATION LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES PROVIDE THIRD PARTY COVERAGE IN WHICH THE COMPANY TYPICALLY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE ENTIRE LOSS UNDER SUCH POLICIES AND THEN

SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE INSURED FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. CLAIMS FROM LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENT FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED EXPENSES BELOW THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, NET OF THE ESTIMATED RECOVERY

OF THE DEDUCTIBLE. THE LIABILITY AND THE RELATED DEDUCTIBLE RECEIVABLE FOR UNPAID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLE AND CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLE, RESPECTIVELY. MOST DEDUCTIBLES

FOR SUCH POLICIES ARE PAID DIRECTLY FROM THE POLICYHOLDERS ESCROW WHICH IS PERIODICALLY REPLENISHED BY THE POLICYHOLDER. THE PAYMENT OF THE LOSS AMOUNTS ABOVE THE DEDUCTIBLE ARE REPORTED WITHIN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

IN THE ABOVE TABLE. BECAUSE THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF THE DEDUCTIBLE (CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLE) OCCURS SHORTLY AFTER THE PAYMENT OF THE DEDUCTIBLE TO A CLAIMANT (CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLE), THESE CASH FLOWS OFFSET EACH OTHER IN THE TABLE.

THE AMOUNTS IN LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS RELATE TO ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS OF SECOND-INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM PAYMENT OF CURRENT CLAIM LIABILITIES.

SECOND INJURY FUNDS COVER THE COST OF ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. FOR LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS, THE COST IS SHARED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND SELF-INSUREDS, FUNDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES

AND SELF-INSUREDS BASED ON LOSSES. AMOUNTS RELATING TO SECOND-INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

(4)

THE AMOUNTS IN REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS REPRESENT ESTIMATED FUTURE NOMINAL PAYMENTS FOR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS.

AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER DEPOSIT AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE TABLE ARE PRESENTED ON A NOMINAL BASIS AND HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE TIME VALUE OF

MONEY. ACCORDINGLY, THE AMOUNTS ABOVE WILL DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET TO EXTENT THAT DEPOSIT VALUES IN THE BALANCE SHEET HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED USING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTING.

THE ABOVE TABLE DOES NOT INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF LIABILITIES REPORTED FOR

STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE COMPANY ISSUING THE ANNUITY. THE COMPANY IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO INCUR FUTURE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH

AGREEMENTS. SEE NOTE 9 OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION.

DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT AND MINNESOTA. THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF BOTH STATES APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRES NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL

BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND, THAT TOGETHER

90

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURERS SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31,

OR THE INSURERS NET INCOME FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. (IN THE CASE OF MINNESOTA, NET INCOME EXCLUDES REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS FOR

PURPOSES OF THE CALCULATION OF THE 10% THRESHOLD). THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.

THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH THE

COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE RESTRICTIVE, LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. A MAXIMUM OF $2.61 BILLION IS AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2005 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS WITHOUT

PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT FOR CONNECTICUT-DOMICILED SUBSIDIARIES AND THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE FOR MINNESOTA-DOMICILED SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY RECEIVED $2.09 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES IN 2004.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

THE NAIC ADOPTED RBC REQUIREMENTS FOR PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES TO BE USED

AS MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THE NAIC AND STATES TO IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MERIT FURTHER REGULATORY ACTION. THE FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE AMONG ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH LEVELS OF CAPITAL HIGHER

THAN RBC REQUIREMENTS. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE TO USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, ALL OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS REQUIRING

ANY COMPANY OR REGULATORY ACTION.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO CERTAIN CONTINGENT

OBLIGATIONS FOR GUARANTEES RELATED TO AGENCY LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES, THIRD PARTY LOANS RELATED TO VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND VARIOUS INDEMNIFICATIONS RELATED TO THE SALE OF BUSINESS ENTITIES TO THIRD PARTIES.

SEE NOTE 17 TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES TO BE THOSE APPLIED TO CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, AND INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS.

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL

EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON THE COMPANYS

ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES,

THE COMPANY ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES, REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION. THE RESERVES ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY BY A QUALIFIED ACTUARY EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY.

THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE

VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS

91

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR LOSS AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE

DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY

REFINES ITS LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. THE COMPANY RIGOROUSLY ATTEMPTS TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE

TIME LOSS RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT ENVIRONMENT, FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT ANTICIPATED

AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN CURRENTLY RESERVEDFAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE.

BECAUSE ESTABLISHMENT OF LOSS RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES, CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED

RESERVES MAY CHANGE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED.

A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS LOSS RESERVES ARE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION WHICH AGGREGATED $4.57 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2004. WHILE THE ONGOING STUDY OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES AND OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN

MAJOR LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT

RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. SEE THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

AS DESCRIBED EARLIER, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED SPCS RUNOFF HEALTH CARE

RESERVES IN THE MERGER, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE IN THE TABLE BELOW. SPC DECIDED TO EXIT THIS MARKET AT THE END OF 2001 AND CEASED UNDERWRITING NEW BUSINESS AS QUICKLY AS REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS ALLOWED. SPC HAD

EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON ITS HEALTH CARE LOSS RESERVES BOTH PRIOR TO AND SINCE ITS DECISION TO EXIT THIS MARKET. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO UTILIZE SPECIFIC TOOLS AND METRICS TO EXPLICITLY MONITOR AND VALIDATE ITS KEY

ASSUMPTIONS SUPPORTING ITS CONCLUSIONS WITH REGARD TO THESE RESERVES. THESE TOOLS AND METRICS WERE ESTABLISHED TO MORE EXPLICITLY MONITOR AND VALIDATE KEY ASSUMPTIONS SUPPORTING THE COMPANYS RESERVE CONCLUSIONS SINCE MANAGEMENT BELIEVED THAT

ITS TRADITIONAL STATISTICS AND RESERVING METHODS NEEDED TO BE SUPPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MORE MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS. THE TOOLS DEVELOPED TRACK THREE PRIMARY INDICATORS WHICH INFLUENCE THOSE CONCLUSIONS AND INCLUDE: NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS;

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS; AND THE REDUNDANCY RATIO, WHICH COMPARES THE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS TO THE RESERVE ESTABLISHED FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. THESE THREE INDICATORS ARE RELATED SUCH THAT IF ONE DETERIORATES, ADDITIONAL

IMPROVEMENT ON ANOTHER IS NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO CONCLUDE THAT FURTHER RESERVE STRENGTHENING IS NOT NECESSARY. THE RESULTS OF THESE INDICATORS IN 2004 SUPPORT THE COMPANYS CURRENT VIEW THAT IT HAS RECORDED A REASONABLE PROVISION FOR ITS

MEDICAL MALPRACTICE EXPOSURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL TAKE RESERVE ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE IF THESE INDICATORS NO LONGER SUPPORT THIS VIEW.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 INCREASED BY $24.51 BILLION OVER YEAR-END 2003, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER WITH SPC AND RESERVE CHARGES RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER. OF THE INCREASE IN 2004, $19.50

BILLION RESULTED FROM THE ADDITION OF THE ACQUIRED RESERVES, AND $2.39 BILLION, NET OF REINSURANCE, WAS DUE TO NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF $928 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT

OF THE COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL ASBESTOS LIABILITY REVIEW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, $290 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, $800 MILLION OF RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER FOR SURETY AND CONSTRUCTION LOSS RESERVES,

$252 MILLION RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, $113 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER AND OTHER NET RESERVING ACTIONS. FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPONENTS OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT, SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL LINES AND INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER LINES IN THE SUMMARY TABLE. ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE DISCUSSED SEPARATELY, SEE ASBESTOS

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

GENERAL DISCUSSION

CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF

LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. THE PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING THESE LIABILITIES BEGINS WITH THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CLAIM DATA. DATA ON INDIVIDUAL

REPORTED CLAIMS, BOTH CURRENT AND HISTORICAL, INCLUDING PAID AMOUNTS AND INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES, ARE GROUPED BY COMMON CHARACTERISTICS (COMPONENTS) AND EVALUATED BY ACTUARIES IN THEIR ANALYSES OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES

BY PRODUCT LINE. SUCH DATA IS OCCASIONALLY SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA AS AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING RESERVES FOR A COMPONENT IS UNDERTAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS, GENERALLY QUARTERLY, IN LIGHT OF CONTINUALLY UPDATED

INFORMATION.

MULTIPLE ESTIMATION METHODS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE

ANALYSIS OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES. EACH ESTIMATION METHOD HAS ITS OWN SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES AND ITS OWN ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, WITH NO SINGLE ESTIMATION METHOD BEING BETTER THAN THE OTHERS IN ALL SITUATIONS AND NO ONE SET OF

ASSUMPTION VARIABLES BEING MEANINGFUL FOR ALL PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS. THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE PARTICULAR ESTIMATION METHODS WHEN APPLIED TO A PARTICULAR GROUP OF CLAIMS CAN ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME. THEREFORE, THE ACTUAL CHOICE OF

ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CAN CHANGE WITH EACH EVALUATION. THE ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CHOSEN ARE THOSE THAT ARE BELIEVED TO PRODUCE THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATION AT THAT PARTICULAR EVALUATION DATE FOR THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED.

93

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN MOST CASES, MULTIPLE ESTIMATION METHODS WILL BE VALID FOR THE PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF

THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED. THIS WILL RESULT IN A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES FOR ANY PARTICULAR CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY USES SUCH RANGE ANALYSES TO BACK TEST WHETHER PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES FOR RESERVES AT THE REPORTING

SEGMENTS ARE REASONABLE, GIVEN SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION. REPORTED VALUES FOUND TO BE CLOSER TO THE ENDPOINTS OF A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER DETAILED REVIEWS. THESE REVIEWS MAY SUBSTANTIATE THE VALIDITY OF MANAGEMENTS

RECORDED ESTIMATE OR LEAD TO A CHANGE IN THE REPORTED ESTIMATE.

THE EXACT BOUNDARY POINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN QUANTITATIVE IN NATURE, AS NO CLEAR LINE OF DEMARCATION EXISTS TO DETERMINE WHEN THE SET OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR AN ESTIMATION METHOD SWITCHES FROM BEING REASONABLE

TO UNREASONABLE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ENDPOINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE OR WOULD BE COMPARABLE ACROSS COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT ESTIMATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES

MAKE THE AGGREGATION OF INDIVIDUAL RANGES A HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL AND INEXACT PROCESS.

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES ARE EITHER WRITTEN ON A CLAIMS MADE OR ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. POLICIES WRITTEN ON A CLAIMS MADE BASIS REQUIRE THAT CLAIMS BE REPORTED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD. POLICIES THAT ARE

WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS REQUIRE THAT THE INSURED DEMONSTRATE THAT A LOSS OCCURRED IN THE POLICY PERIOD, EVEN IF THE INSURED REPORTS THE LOSS MANY YEARS LATER.

MOST GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. THESE POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL LOSS

DEVELOPMENT OVER TIME AS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE POLICY ISSUANCE. THE USE OF THE OCCURRENCE FORM ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, AND IT IS ALSO USED TO PROVIDE

COVERAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION GENERAL LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. OCCURRENCE BASED FORMS OF INSURANCE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PROJECTION OF VARIOUS TRENDS, INCLUDING FUTURE INFLATION AND JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS

AND SOCIETAL LITIGATION DYNAMICS, AMONG OTHERS.

A KEY

ASSUMPTION IN MOST ACTUARIAL ANALYSES IS THAT PAST PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED IN THE DATA WILL REPEAT THEMSELVES IN THE FUTURE, ABSENT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW. TO THE EXTENT A MATERIAL CHANGE AFFECTING THE

ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY IS KNOWN, SUCH CHANGE IS QUANTIFIED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL COMPANY AND, IF AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXTERNAL DATA. SUCH A MEASUREMENT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE

PARTICULAR CLAIM PORTFOLIO AND THE KNOWN CHANGE BEING EVALUATED.

INFORMED MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE RESERVING PROCESS. THIS INCLUDES THE APPLICATION, ON A CONSISTENT BASIS OVER TIME, OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. IN ADDITION TO

ACTUARIES, INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED WITH THE RESERVING PROCESS ALSO INCLUDE UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PERSONNEL AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE AND, GENERALLY, LIKELY THAT MANAGEMENT MUST CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL

VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES. IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE, SUCH AS A MERGER, CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF INFORMED JUDGMENT BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT.

THE VARIABLES DISCUSSED ABOVE IN THIS GENERAL DISCUSSION HAVE DIFFERENT

IMPACTS ON RESERVE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE CLAIM TAIL, THE REPORTING LAG, THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CLAIM PROCESS FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE.

PRODUCT LINES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIABLE AS EITHER LONG TAIL OR SHORT TAIL,

BASED ON THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING CLAIMS UNDER A POLICY AND THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THOSE CLAIMS. SHORT TAIL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED QUICKLY, RESULTING IN LESS ESTIMATION VARIABILITY. THE LONGER THE TIME BEFORE

FINAL CLAIM RESOLUTION, THE GREATER THE EXPOSURE TO ESTIMATION RISKS AND HENCE THE GREATER THE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE CLAIM TAIL IS THE REPORTING LAG. THE REPORTING LAG, WHICH IS THE TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING A CLAIM AND THE REPORTING OF

THE CLAIM TO THE INSURER, MAKES ESTIMATING IBNR INHERENTLY MORE

94

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, THE GREATER THE REPORTING LAG THE GREATER THE PROPORTION OF IBNR CLAIMS TO THE TOTAL CLAIM LIABILITY FOR THE PRODUCT LINE. WRITING

NEW PRODUCTS WITH MATERIAL REPORTING LAGS CAN RESULT IN ADDING SEVERAL YEARS WORTH OF IBNR CLAIM EXPOSURE BEFORE THE REPORTING LAG EXPOSURE BECOMES CLEARLY OBSERVABLE, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PRICING AND RESERVING SUCH PRODUCTS.

THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF CLAIM LIABILITIES WITH LONG REPORTING LAGS ARE ASBESTOS CLAIMS. A MORE RECENT BUT LESS EXTREME EXAMPLE IS AUTOMOBILE LEASING RESIDUAL VALUE COVERAGE.

FOR SOME LINES, THE IMPACT OF LARGE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS CAN BE MATERIAL TO THE ANALYSIS. THESE LINES ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO

AS BEING LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY, WHILE LINES WITHOUT THIS LARGE CLAIM SENSITIVITY ARE REFERRED TO AS HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY. ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY LINES CAN BE SENSITIVE TO A

FEW KEY ASSUMPTIONS. AS A RESULT, THE ROLE OF JUDGMENT IS MUCH GREATER FOR THESE RESERVE ESTIMATES. IN CONTRAST, HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY LINES TEND TO HAVE MUCH GREATER SPREAD OF ESTIMATION RISK, SUCH THAT THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS ARE

RELATIVELY MINOR AND THE RANGE OF REASONABLE RESERVE ESTIMATES IS NARROWER AND MORE STABLE.

CLAIM COMPLEXITY CAN ALSO GREATLY AFFECT THE ESTIMATION PROCESS BY IMPACTING THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ESTIMATE, THE POTENTIAL STABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING DATA AND CLAIM PROCESS AND THE ABILITY

TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA. PRODUCT LINES WITH GREATER CLAIM COMPLEXITY, SUCH AS FOR CERTAIN SURETY AND CONSTRUCTION EXPOSURES, HAVE INHERENTLY GREATER ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

ACTUARIES HAVE TO EXERCISE A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT IN THE EVALUATION OF ALL THESE FACTORS IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF

RESERVES. THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN THE APPLICATION OF ACTUARIAL JUDGMENT IS UNAVOIDABLE WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY. DIFFERENT EXPERTS WILL CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH SUCH UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS,

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF FOCUS. HENCE, THE ESTIMATE SELECTED BY THE VARIOUS ACTUARIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EACH OTHER.

LASTLY, SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN ALSO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS.

DURING THE PAST YEAR, THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC RESULTED IN THE EXPOSURE OF EACH OTHERS ACTUARIES AND CLAIM DEPARTMENTS TO DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, DATA HISTORIES, ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES, CLAIM SETTLEMENT EXPERTS, AND MORE ROBUST DATA WHEN VIEWED

ON A COMBINED BASIS. THIS HAS IMPACTED THE RANGE OF ESTIMATES PRODUCED BY THE COMPANYS ACTUARIES, AS THEY HAVE REACTED TO NEW DATA, APPROACHES, AND SOURCES OF EXPERTISE TO DRAW UPON. IT HAS ALSO RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY, AS

PAST TRENDS (THAT WERE A FUNCTION OF PAST PRODUCTS, PAST CLAIM HANDLING PROCEDURES, PAST CLAIM DEPARTMENTS, AND PAST LEGAL AND OTHER EXPERTS) MAY NOT REPEAT THEMSELVES, AS THOSE ITEMS AFFECTING THE TRENDS CHANGE OR EVOLVE DUE TO THE MERGER. THIS HAS

ALSO INCREASED THE POTENTIAL FOR MATERIAL VARIATION IN ESTIMATES, AS EXPERTS CAN HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS AS TO THE IMPACT OF THESE FREQUENTLY EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES. EVENTS SUCH AS MERGERS INCREASE THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY OF RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME, UNTIL STABLE TRENDS REESTABLISH THEMSELVES WITHIN THE NEW ORGANIZATION.

RISK FACTORS

THE MAJOR CAUSES OF

MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY (RISK FACTORS) GENERALLY WILL VARY FOR EACH PRODUCT LINE, AS WELL AS FOR EACH SEPARATELY ANALYZED COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT LINE. IN SOME CASES, SUCH RISK FACTORS ARE EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ESTIMATION METHOD AND

IN OTHERS, THEY ARE IMPLICIT. FOR EXAMPLE, A METHOD MAY EXPLICITLY ASSUME THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS WILL CLOSE EACH YEAR, BUT WILL IMPLICITLY ASSUME THAT THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING CONTRACT LANGUAGE WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED. ACTUAL

RESULTS WILL LIKELY VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS, RESULTING IN AN ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT BEING ESTIMATED CURRENTLY.

SOME RISK FACTORS WILL AFFECT MORE THAN ONE PRODUCT LINE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CHANGES IN CLAIM DEPARTMENT PRACTICES, CHANGES IN

SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS, COURT ACTIONS, TIMELINESS OF CLAIM REPORTING, STATE MIX OF CLAIMANTS, AND DEGREE OF CLAIMANT FRAUD. THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF A RISK FACTOR WILL ALSO VARY BY COMPONENTS WITHIN A PRODUCT

LINE. INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER RISK FACTORS WITHIN PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS.

95

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE EFFECT OF A PARTICULAR RISK FACTOR ON ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES CANNOT BE ISOLATED IN MOST

CASES. FOR EXAMPLE, ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL CLAIM SETTLEMENTS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL COURT RULINGS, BUT THE FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TYPICALLY DOES NOT DELINEATE HOW MUCH OF THE SETTLED AMOUNT IS DUE TO THIS AND OTHER

FACTORS.

THE EVALUATION OF DATA IS ALSO SUBJECT TO DISTORTION

FROM EXTREME EVENTS OR STRUCTURAL SHIFTS, SOMETIMES IN UNANTICIPATED WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TIMING OF CLAIMS PAYMENTS IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC REGION WILL BE IMPACTED IF CLAIM ADJUSTERS ARE TEMPORARILY REASSIGNED FROM THAT REGION TO HELP SETTLE CATASTROPHE

CLAIMS IN ANOTHER REGION.

WHILE SOME CHANGES IN THE CLAIM

ENVIRONMENT ARE SUDDEN IN NATURE (SUCH AS A NEW COURT RULING AFFECTING THE INTERPRETATION OF ALL CONTRACTS IN THAT JURISDICTION), OTHERS ARE MORE EVOLUTIONARY. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES CAN OCCUR WHEN MULTIPLE FACTORS AFFECT FINAL CLAIM VALUES, WITH THE

UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING EACH FACTOR BEING RESOLVED SEPARATELY, IN STEP-WISE FASHION. THE FINAL IMPACT IS NOT KNOWN UNTIL ALL STEPS HAVE OCCURRED.

SUDDEN CHANGES GENERALLY CAUSE A ONE-TIME SHIFT IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME LAG IN RELIABLE QUANTIFICATION OF THEIR IMPACT.

EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES GENERALLY CAUSE A SERIES OF SHIFTS IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, AS EACH COMPONENT OF THE EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE BECOMES EVIDENT AND ESTIMABLE.

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES

AT LEAST ONCE PER QUARTER, COMPANY MANAGEMENT MEETS WITH ITS ACTUARIES TO REVIEW THE LATEST CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE ANALYSES. BASED ON

THESE ANALYSES, MANAGEMENT DETERMINES WHETHER ITS ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CHANGED. IN DOING SO, IT MUST EVALUATE WHETHER THE NEW DATA PROVIDED REPRESENTS CREDIBLE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION OR AN ANOMALY THAT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON

ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, PAYMENTS MAY HAVE DECREASED IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC REGION DUE TO FEWER CLAIM ADJUSTERS BEING AVAILABLE TO PROCESS CLAIMS. THE RESULTING CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS WOULD BE ANALYZED TO

DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CHANGE IN PAYMENT PATTERN REPRESENTS A CHANGE IN ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY.

SUCH AN ASSESSMENT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT. IT IS FREQUENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CHANGE IN THE DATA IS AN ANOMALY UNTIL SOMETIME

AFTER THE EVENT. EVEN IF A CHANGE IS DETERMINED TO BE PERMANENT, IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE UNTIL SOMETIME LATER. THE OVERALL DETAILED ANALYSES SUPPORTING SUCH AN EFFORT CAN TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS TO

PERFORM. THIS IS DUE TO THE NEED TO EVALUATE THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE TRENDS OBSERVED, AND MAY INCLUDE THE GATHERING OR ASSEMBLING OF DATA NOT PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. IT MAY ALSO INCLUDE INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE UNDERLYING

PROCESSES. AS A RESULT, THERE CAN BE A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE EMERGENCE OF A CHANGE AND A DETERMINATION THAT THE CHANGE SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED CLAIM LIABILITIES. THE FINAL ESTIMATE SELECTED BY MANAGEMENT IN A REPORTING

PERIOD IS A FUNCTION OF THESE DETAILED ANALYSES OF PAST DATA, ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ANY NEW ACTIONABLE INFORMATION.

DISCUSSION OF PRODUCT LINES

THE FOLLOWING SECTION DETAILS RESERVING CONSIDERATIONS AND COMMON RISK FACTORS BY PRODUCT LINE. THERE ARE MANY ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT

ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS. EACH RISK FACTOR PRESENTED WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT ON REQUIRED RESERVES. ALSO, RISK FACTORS CAN HAVE OFFSETTING OR COMPOUNDING EFFECTS ON REQUIRED RESERVES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN WORKERS COMPENSATION, THE USE OF EXPENSIVE

MEDICAL PROCEDURES THAT RESULT IN MEDICAL COST INFLATION MAY ENABLE WORKERS TO RETURN TO WORK FASTER, THEREBY LOWERING INDEMNITY COSTS. THUS, IN ALMOST ALL CASES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCRETELY MEASURE THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE RISK FACTOR AND

CONSTRUCT A MEANINGFUL SENSITIVITY EXPECTATION.

GENERAL LIABILITY

GENERAL LIABILITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL

LINE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF

96

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION AND SPECIFIC POLICY PROVISIONS SUCH AS SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPONENTS UNDERLYING THE

GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. SOME OF THESE HAVE RELATIVELY MODERATE PAYMENT PATTERNS (WITH MOST OF THE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR CLOSED WITHIN 5 TO 7 YEARS), WHILE OTHERS CAN HAVE EXTREME LAGS IN BOTH REPORTING AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS (E.G.,

A REPORTING LAG OF A DECADE FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT CLAIMS).

WHILE THE MAJORITY OF GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS, CERTAIN GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES (SUCH AS THOSE COVERING DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OR PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY) ARE

TYPICALLY INSURED ON A CLAIMS-MADE BASIS.

GENERAL

LIABILITY RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED AS TWO COMPONENTS: PRIMARY AND EXCESS/UMBRELLA, WITH THE PRIMARY COMPONENT GENERALLY ANALYZED SEPARATELY FOR BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. BODILY INJURY LIABILITY PAYMENTS REIMBURSE THE CLAIMANT FOR

DAMAGES PERTAINING TO PHYSICAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF THE POLICYHOLDERS LEGAL OBLIGATION ARISING FROM NON-INTENTIONAL ACTS SUCH AS NEGLIGENCE, SUBJECT TO THE INSURANCE POLICY PROVISIONS. IN SOME CASES THE DAMAGES CAN INCLUDE FUTURE WAGE LOSS

(WHICH IS A FUNCTION OF FUTURE EARNINGS POWER AND WAGE INFLATION) AND FUTURE MEDICAL TREATMENT COSTS. PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY PAYMENTS RESULT FROM DAMAGES TO THE CLAIMANTS PRIVATE PROPERTY ARISING FROM THE POLICYHOLDERS LEGAL

OBLIGATION FOR NON-INTENTIONAL ACTS. IN MOST CASES, PROPERTY DAMAGE LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF COSTS AS OF THE LOSS DATE, OR SOON THEREAFTER. IN ADDITION, SIZABLE OR UNIQUE EXPOSURES ARE REVIEWED SEPARATELY, SUCH AS ASBESTOS, ENVIRONMENTAL, OTHER MASS

TORTS, CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND LARGE UNIQUE ACCOUNTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DISTORT THE ANALYSIS. THESE UNIQUE CATEGORIES OFTEN REQUIRE A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND REQUIRE RESERVE ANALYSES THAT DO NOT RELY ON TRADITIONAL

ACTUARIAL METHODS.

DEFENSE COSTS ARE ALSO A PART OF THE

INSURED COSTS COVERED BY LIABILITY POLICIES AND CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, SOMETIMES GREATER THAN THE COST OF THE ACTUAL PAID CLAIMS. FOR SOME PRODUCTS THIS RISK IS MITIGATED BY POLICY LANGUAGE SUCH THAT THE INSURED PORTION OF DEFENSE COSTS ERODES THE

AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT AVAILABLE TO PAY THE CLAIM. SUCH DEFENSE WITHIN THE LIMITS POLICIES ARE MOST COMMON FOR CLAIMS MADE PRODUCTS. WHEN DEFENSE COSTS ARE OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITS, AMOUNTS PAID DO NOT ERODE THE POLICY LIMITS.

THIS LINE IS TYPICALLY THE LARGEST SOURCE OF RESERVE ESTIMATE

UNCERTAINTY IN THE UNITED STATES (EXCLUDING ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS COVERING THE SAME RISK). MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY INCLUDE THE REPORTING LAG (I.E. THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING COVERAGE AND

THE ACTUAL REPORTING OF THE CLAIM), THE NUMBER OF PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE UNDERLYING TORT ACTION, WHETHER THE EVENT TRIGGERING COVERAGE IS CONFINED TO ONLY ONE TIME PERIOD OR IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE TIME PERIODS, THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS

INVOLVED (IN THE INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ACTIONS), WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND INTENDED TO BE COVERED AT THE TIME THE CONTRACTS WERE WRITTEN (I.E., COVERAGE DISPUTE POTENTIAL), AND THE POTENTIAL FOR MASS CLAIM ACTIONS. CLAIMS WITH

LONGER REPORTING LAGS RESULT IN GREATER INHERENT RISK. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR ALLEGED CLAIMS WITH A LATENCY FEATURE, PARTICULARLY WHERE COURTS HAVE RULED THAT COVERAGE IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE POLICY YEARS, HENCE INVOLVING MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS

(AND THEIR INSURERS AND REINSURERS) AND MULTIPLE POLICIES (THEREBY INCREASING THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED AND THE UNDERLYING SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY). CLAIMS WITH LONG LATENCIES ALSO INCREASE THE POTENTIAL RECOGNITION LAG, I.E., THE LAG BETWEEN

WRITING A TYPE OF POLICY IN A CERTAIN MARKET AND THE RECOGNITION THAT SUCH POLICIES HAVE POTENTIAL MASS TORT AND/OR LATENT CLAIM EXPOSURE.

THE AMOUNT OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY ALSO VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY BY COMPONENT FOR THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. THE COMPONENTS IN THIS PRODUCT

LINE WITH THE LONGEST LATENCY, LONGEST REPORTING LAGS, LARGEST POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED, AND GREATEST CLAIM SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY ARE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL. COMPONENTS THAT INCLUDE LATENCY, REPORTING LAG AND/OR COMPLEXITY ISSUES, BUT TO A

MATERIALLY LESSER EXTENT THAN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE, AND OTHER MASS TORT ACTIONS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO SILICONE IMPLANTS. MANY COMPONENTS OF GENERAL LIABILITY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO MATERIAL

LATENCY OR CLAIM COMPLEXITY RISKS AND HENCE HAVE MATERIALLY LESS UNCERTAINTY THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED COMPONENTS. IN GENERAL, POLICIES PROVIDING COVERAGE WITH SHORTER REPORTING LAGS, FEWER PARTIES INVOLVED IN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS, ONLY ONE

POLICY POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED PER CLAIM, FEWER POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOLLARS, REASONABLY

RELATED TO LARGE PROPERTIES. THE CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE CLAIM RESERVES IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE INSURER. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A LOW ESTIMATION RISK, EXCEPT

POSSIBLY FOR CATASTROPHES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS.

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY

AND LIABILITY COVERAGE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE, IT GENERALLY TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS, WHILE FOR THE OTHER COVERAGES, GENERALLY

FOR THE LIABILITY COVERAGES, IT TAKES A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS.

THE RESERVING RISK FOR THIS LINE IS DOMINATED BY THE LIABILITY COVERAGE PORTION OF THIS PRODUCT, EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY IN THE EVENT OF CATASTROPHIC OR LARGE SINGLE LOSSES. THE RESERVING RISK FOR THIS LINE DIFFERS FROM

THAT OF THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE AND THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CUSTOMER. COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL IS GENERALLY SOLD TO SMALLER SIZED ACCOUNTS, WHILE THE CUSTOMER PROFILE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY AND PROPERTY INCLUDE

LARGER CUSTOMERS.

SEE THE DISCUSSIONS UNDER THE PROPERTY AND

GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINES WITH REGARD TO RESERVING RISK FOR COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE IS A MIX OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGES AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS

AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. IN GENERAL, CLAIM REPORTING LAGS ARE MINOR, CLAIM COMPLEXITY IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE, AND THE LINE IS

VIEWED AS HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN FOUR COMPONENTS; BODILY INJURY LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY, COLLISION CLAIMS AND

COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS. THESE LAST TWO COMPONENTS HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT PRESENTED.

WORKERS COMPENSATION

WORKERS COMPENSATION IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL COVERAGE, AS

IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE CLAIMS FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. WHILE CERTAIN PAYMENTS SUCH AS INITIAL MEDICAL TREATMENT OR TEMPORARY WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR THE INJURED WORKER ARE MADE QUICKLY, SOME OTHER PAYMENTS ARE MADE

OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS, SUCH AS AWARDS FOR PERMANENT PARTIAL INJURIES. IN ADDITION, SOME PAYMENTS CAN RUN AS LONG AS THE INJURED WORKERS LIFE, SUCH AS PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS AND ON-GOING MEDICAL CARE. DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY

OF LONG PAYMENT TAIL, THE REPORTING LAGS ARE GENERALLY SHORT, SETTLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT COMPLEX, AND MOST OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE CONSIDERED HIGH FREQUENCY, MODERATE SEVERITY. THE LARGEST RESERVE RISK GENERALLY COMES FROM THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH

SEVERITY CLAIMS PROVIDING LIFETIME COVERAGE FOR MEDICAL EXPENSE ARISING FROM A WORKERS INJURY. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A SOMEWHAT GREATER THAN MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

WORKERS COMPENSATION RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN THREE

COMPONENTS: INDEMNITY LOSSES, MEDICAL LOSSES AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

FIDELITY AND SURETY

FIDELITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. IT TAKES A

RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE FIDELITY CLAIMS. THE VOLATILITY OF FIDELITY RESERVES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS OF THE INSURED, THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE INSUREDS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AMOUNT OF

POLICY LIMIT AND ATTACHMENT POINT OF COVERAGE. THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING RESERVES FOR SMALL, COMMERCIAL INSUREDS IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN THE UNCERTAINTY FOR LARGE COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW SEVERITY NATURE OF

SMALL COMMERCIAL FIDELITY LOSSES PROVIDES FOR STABILITY IN LOSS ESTIMATES WHEREAS, THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY NATURE OF LOSSES FOR LARGE INSUREDS RESULTS IN A WIDER RANGE OF ULTIMATE LOSS OUTCOMES. ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES THAT RELY ON A STABLE

PATTERN OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT ARE GENERALLY NOT APPLICABLE TO LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY POLICIES.

SURETY HAS CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED SHORT TAIL COVERAGES WITH SHORT REPORTING LAGS, ALTHOUGH LARGE INDIVIDUAL CONSTRUCTION AND

COMMERCIAL SURETY CONTRACTS CAN RESULT IN A SOMEWHAT LONGER SETTLEMENT TAIL, BASED ON THE LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OR COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION BEING INSURED. (LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS CAN TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE.) THE

FREQUENCY OF LOSSES IN SURETY CORRELATES WITH ECONOMIC CYCLES AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF SURETY LOSS IS THE INABILITY TO PERFORM FINANCIALLY. THE VOLATILITY OF SURETY LOSSES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS PERFORMED BY THE INSURED, THE

TYPE OF BONDED OBLIGATION, THE AMOUNT OF LIMIT EXPOSED TO LOSS AND THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS AVAILABLE TO THE INSURER TO MITIGATE LOSSES, SUCH AS UNBILLED CONTRACT FUNDS, COLLATERAL, FIRST AND THIRD PARTY INDEMNITY, AND OTHER SECURITY POSITIONS OF AN

INSUREDS ASSETS. CERTAIN CLASSES OF SURETY CLAIMS ARE VERY HIGH SEVERITY, LOW FREQUENCY IN NATURE. THESE CAN INCLUDE LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS INVOLVED WITH ONE OR MULTIPLE LARGE, COMPLEX PROJECTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN LARGE COMMERCIAL

SURETY EXPOSURES. OTHER CLAIM FACTORS AFFECTING RESERVE VARIABILITY OF SURETY INCLUDE LITIGATION RELATED TO AMOUNTS OWED BY AND DUE THE INSURED (E.G., SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION EFFORTS) AND THE RESULTS OF FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF AN INSURED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER CLAIM LIABILITIES RESULT FROM A MIX OF COVERAGES, CURRENCIES AND

JURISDICTIONS/COUNTRIES. THE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC IS THE NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE ANALYSIS TO THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT, AND THE INABILITY TO RELY ON DATA CHARACTERIZATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. STATUTORY REPORTING FRAMEWORK.

DUE TO CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS MIX FOR THIS LINE OVER TIME,

THE RECENTLY INCURRED CLAIM LIABILITIES ARE RELATIVELY SHORT TERM (DUE TO BOTH THE PRODUCTS AND THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED, E.G., THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM), WHILE THE OLDER LIABILITIES INCLUDE SOME FROM RUNOFF OPERATIONS THAT

ARE EXTREMELY LONG TAIL (E.G., U.S. EXCESS LIABILITIES REINSURED THROUGH THE LONDON MARKET, AND SEVERAL UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF). THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE

JURISDICTION, THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (E.G., UNDERWRITING POOL VERSUS DIRECT), AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE INSURANCE SALE TO THE INSURED HAZARD (E.G., INSURED AND INSURER LOCATED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES). IN PARTICULAR, LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE

UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS, SETTLEMENT LAGS AND CLAIM COMPLEXITY, DUE TO THE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER POOL MEMBERS OR CO-INSURERS THROUGH A BROKER OR LEAD-INSURER FOR CLAIM SETTLEMENT PURPOSES.

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED BY

PROGRAM/POOL, COUNTRY AND GENERAL COVERAGE CATEGORY (E.G., U.S. LIABILITYEXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE, OR GENERAL LIABILITY  MUNICIPALITIES  BY COUNTRY.) THE BUSINESS IS ALSO GENERALLY SPLIT BY DIRECT VERSUS ASSUMED REINSURANCE FOR A

GIVEN COVERAGE/JURISDICTION. WHERE THE UNDERLYING INSURED HAZARD IS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE UNDERLYING COVERAGES ARE GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND AUTOMOBILE DISCUSSION ABOVE, BUT UNDER A DIFFERENT LEGAL

SYSTEM. WHERE THE UNDERLYING HAZARD IS WITHIN THE U.S., THE COVERAGE INVOLVED IS TYPICALLY THAT OF GENERAL LIABILITY, BUT ON AN EXCESS OR EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE BASIS. EXCESS EXPOSURE REQUIRES THE INSURED TO PROVE NOT ONLY CLAIMS

UNDER THE POLICY, BUT ALSO THE PRIOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS REACHING UP TO THE EXCESS POLICYS ATTACHMENT POINT.

EXAMPLES OF COMMON RISK FACTORS THAT CAN CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER RESERVES (BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL

DISCUSSION SECTION) INCLUDE.

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE

FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE CLAIM LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE REINSURED BUSINESS. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE

ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND

ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO DETERMINE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS

AND DISPUTES.

THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ONGOING REVIEW OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE

COVERAGE DEFENSES, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES. CHANGES IN

THESE ESTIMATES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES. THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE IN 2004 WAS $364 MILLION, $256 MILLION OF WHICH WAS MERGER-RELATED AND $108 MILLION OF WHICH RESULTED FROM THE

COMPANYS ONGOING REVIEW PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES

AN INVESTMENT IN A FIXED MATURITY OR EQUITY SECURITY WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR SALE OR REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IS IMPAIRED IF ITS FAIR VALUE FALLS BELOW ITS

BOOK VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

FIXED MATURITIES FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN 80% OF AMORTIZED COST FOR MORE THAN ONE QUARTER ARE EVALUATED FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. A FIXED MATURITY IS IMPAIRED IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SECURITYS CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

FACTORS THE COMPANY CONSIDERS IN DETERMINING WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY FOR DEBT SECURITIES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



THE LENGTH OF TIME AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE DECLINE WILL BECOME OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IF THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN

BELOW COST FOR SIX TO NINE MONTHS OR MORE;



THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER. THE ISSUER MAY BE EXPERIENCING DEPRESSED AND DECLINING EARNINGS RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS, EROSION OF MARKET SHARE,

DETERIORATING FINANCIAL POSITION, LOWERED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, DECLINES IN SECURITIES RATINGS, BANKRUPTCY, AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTS THAT INDICATE AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE. ALSO, THE ISSUER MAY EXPERIENCE SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT MAY INFLUENCE ITS

OPERATIONS OR EARNINGS POTENTIAL, SUCH AS CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, DISCONTINUATION OF A BUSINESS SEGMENT, CATASTROPHIC LOSSES OR EXHAUSTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES; AND



THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE IMPAIRED WHEN IT BECOMES PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY

WILL NOT RECOVER ITS COST OVER THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD. PUBLIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS (I.E., COMMON STOCKS) TRADING AT A PRICE THAT IS LESS THAN 80% OF COST FOR MORE THAN ONE QUARTER ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT. INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE

EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANY TIME THE INVESTMENT HAS SUSTAINED LOSSES AND/OR NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR A PERIOD OF NINE MONTHS OR MORE. EVENTS TRIGGERING THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC

AND NON-PUBLIC EQUITIES MAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING, IN ADDITION TO THE CONSIDERATIONS NOTED ABOVE FOR DEBT SECURITIES.

FACTORS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE.



THE INVESTEE LOSES A PRINCIPAL CUSTOMER OR SUPPLIER FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SHORT-TERM PROSPECT FOR REPLACEMENT OR EXPERIENCES OTHER SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS;



THE COMPANY IS PERFORMING SUBSTANTIALLY AND CONSISTENTLY BEHIND PLAN;



THE INVESTEE HAS ANNOUNCED, OR THE COMPANY HAS BECOME AWARE OF, ADVERSE CHANGES OR EVENTS SUCH AS CHANGES OR PLANNED CHANGES IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT, RESTRUCTURINGS, OR A SALE OF

ASSETS; AND



THE REGULATORY, ECONOMIC, OR TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED IN A WAY THAT IS EXPECTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE INVESTEES PROFITABILITY.

FACTORS AFFECTING ON-GOING FINANCIAL CONDITION.



FACTORS THAT RAISE DOUBTS ABOUT THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, SUCH AS NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, WORKING-CAPITAL DEFICIENCIES, INVESTMENT

ADVISORS RECOMMENDATIONS, OR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OR DEBT COVENANTS;



A SECONDARY EQUITY OFFERING AT A PRICE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THE HOLDERS COST;



A BREACH OF A COVENANT OR THE FAILURE TO SERVICE DEBT; AND



FRAUD WITHIN THE COMPANY.

106

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR FIXED MATURITY AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, FACTORS THAT MAY INDICATE THAT A DECLINE IN VALUE IS NOT

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



THE SECURITIES OWNED CONTINUE TO GENERATE REASONABLE EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS, DESPITE A GENERAL STOCK MARKET DECLINE;



BOND INTEREST OR PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDEND RATE (ON COST) IS LOWER THAN RATES FOR SIMILAR SECURITIES ISSUED CURRENTLY BUT QUALITY OF INVESTMENT IS NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED;



THE INVESTMENT IS PERFORMING AS EXPECTED AND IS CURRENT ON ALL EXPECTED PAYMENTS;



SPECIFIC, RECOGNIZABLE, SHORT-TERM FACTORS HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET VALUE; AND



FINANCIAL CONDITION, MARKET SHARE, BACKLOG AND OTHER KEY STATISTICS INDICATE GROWTH.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

THE CARRYING VALUES OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY

NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY.

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

OTHER INVESTMENTS

INCLUDE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INSTRUMENTS, CONSISTING OF EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES AND, HISTORICALLY, HAVING A HOLDING PERIOD OF FOUR TO SEVEN YEARS. THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN MADE IN THE HEALTH

CARE, SOFTWARE AND COMPUTER SERVICES, AND NETWORKING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES INFRASTRUCTURES INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY IS INVOLVED WITH VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES EARLY IN THEIR FORMATION, AS THEY ARE DEVELOPING AND DETERMINING THE

VIABILITY OF, AND MARKET DEMAND FOR, THEIR PRODUCT. GENERALLY THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES TO RECORD REVENUES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT, WHICH CAN OFTEN TAKE THREE TO FOUR YEARS, AND DOES NOT GENERALLY

EXPECT THEM TO BECOME PROFITABLE FOR AN EVEN LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS VALUATION OF SUCH NON-PUBLICLY TRADED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AS WELL AS AN INTERNAL VALUATION

COMMITTEE REVIEW AND CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



THE ISSUERS MOST RECENT FINANCING EVENT;



AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER FUNDAMENTAL DETERIORATION HAS OCCURRED;



WHETHER OR NOT THE ISSUERS PROGRESS HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN EXPECTED;



WHETHER OR NOT THE VALUATIONS HAVE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE ENTITYS MARKET SECTOR;



WHETHER OR NOT THE INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE BELIEVES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ISSUER WILL NEED FINANCING WITHIN SIX MONTHS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN OUR CARRYING VALUE; AND



WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY, ENABLING US TO RECEIVE VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN OUR

COST.

THE QUARTERLY VALUATION PROCEDURES

DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY TO FREQUENTLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THOSE INVESTED ASSETS, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EVENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES THE PORTFOLIO TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM

RETURN, EVALUATING CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR THE ENTITIES IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED. BECAUSE THIS PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF

107

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PRIVATELY-HELD, EARLY-STAGE VENTURE INVESTMENTS, EVENTS GIVING RISE TO IMPAIRMENT CAN OCCUR IN A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME (E.G., THE ENTITY HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL

IN SECURING ADDITIONAL FINANCING, OTHER INVESTORS DECIDE TO WITHDRAW THEIR SUPPORT, COMPLICATIONS ARISE IN THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, ETC.), AND DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THAT POINT IN TIME, BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WITH

RESPECT TO A RECOGNITION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OR SALE OF THE INVESTMENT.

NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, AND CERTAIN FIXED INCOME SECURITIES.

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS OWNED DIRECTLY ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR JOINT VENTURES, LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY SECURITIES. CERTAIN OTHER

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (FAS) NO. 115,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES,

BUT ARE

REPORTED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 60,

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY INSURANCE ENTERPRISES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE DETERMINED BY AN INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE FOR

SECURITIES FOR WHICH THERE IS NO PUBLIC MARKET. THE INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE REVIEWS SUCH FACTORS AS RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH, AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTAL STATISTICS IN ESTIMATING

FAIR VALUES OF SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS.

OTHER MATTERS

ON JULY 23, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM

THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $1.63 BILLION ($1.07 BILLION AFTER-TAX). THE

COMPANY RECORDED THESE ADJUSTMENTS AS CHARGES IN ITS INCOME STATEMENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. THROUGH AN INFORMAL COMMENT PROCESS, THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO

THESE ADJUSTMENTS, AND THE DIALOGUE IS ONGOING. SPECIFICALLY, THE STAFF HAS ASKED FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANYS ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN OF SPCS INSURANCE RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND PREMIUMS DUE FROM

POLICYHOLDERS, AND HOW THOSE ADJUSTMENTS MAY RELATE TO SPCS RESERVES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER. AFTER REVIEWING THE STAFFS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES

TO BELIEVE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE. IF, HOWEVER, THE STAFF DISAGREES, SOME OR ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS BEING DISCUSSED MAY NOT BE RECORDED AS CHARGES IN THE COMPANYS INCOME STATEMENT, THEREBY INCREASING

NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2004 AND INCREASING SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, IN EACH CASE BY THE APPROXIMATE AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF THE CHANGE. THE EFFECT ON TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (ADJUSTED FOR THE

EFFECTS OF DEFERRED TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL. INCREASES TO GOODWILL AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WOULD BE REFLECTED ON THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET AS OF APRIL 1, 2004,

EITHER DUE TO PURCHASE ACCOUNTING OR ADJUSTMENT OF SPCS RESERVES PRIOR TO THE MERGER.

108

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES ON A STATUTORY BASIS WERE $41.73 BILLION, $24.03 BILLION

AND $23.28 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE $17.70 BILLION INCREASE IN 2004 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE MERGER WITH SPC AND RESERVE CHARGES RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER. THOSE RESERVE CHARGES INCLUDED $928 MILLION

TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL ASBESTOS LIABILITY REVIEW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, $290 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER OF

$500 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION AND $300 MILLION FOR SURETY, $252 MILLION RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, $113 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER, AND OTHER NET RESERVING ACTIONS.

THE $749 MILLION INCREASE IN RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

ON A STATUTORY BASIS FROM DECEMBER 31, 2002 TO DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH, AND RESERVE STRENGTHENING AT GULF WHICH INCREASED RESERVES BY $521 MILLION AND AMERICAN EQUITY WHICH INCREASED RESERVES BY $115 MILLION, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL NET LOSS PAYMENTS OF $607 MILLION.

PRIOR TO THE IPO, TPC PARTICIPATED IN CITIGROUPS CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PLAN (CAP) THAT PROVIDED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF CITIGROUP COMMON STOCK IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES.

ON AUGUST 20, 2002, IN CONNECTION WITH THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION, THE UNVESTED OUTSTANDING AWARDS OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND DEFERRED SHARES HELD BY TPC EMPLOYEES ON THAT DATE UNDER CITIGROUP CAP AWARDS WERE CANCELLED AND REPLACED BY AWARDS COMPRISED

PRIMARILY OF 3 MILLION NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF $53 MILLION BASED ON THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE CLASS A COMMON STOCK ON AUGUST 20, 2002. THESE REPLACEMENT AWARDS WERE GRANTED ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME

TERMS, INCLUDING VESTING, AS THE FORMER CITIGROUP AWARDS. THE VALUE OF THESE NEWLY ISSUED SHARES ALONG WITH CLASS A AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK RECEIVED IN THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION ON THE CITIGROUP RESTRICTED SHARES, WERE EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF THE

CANCELLED CITIGROUP RESTRICTED SHARE AWARDS. IN ADDITION THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS PLAN ALLOWS DEFERRED RECEIPT OF SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK (DEFERRED STOCK) TO A FUTURE DISTRIBUTION DATE OR UPON TERMINATION OF THEIR SERVICE.

PRIOR TO THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION ON AUGUST 20, 2002, UNEARNED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CITIGROUP RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK GRANTS IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. FOLLOWING THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION AND THE ISSUANCE OF REPLACEMENT STOCK AWARDS IN TPCS CLASS A AND CLASS B

SHARES ON AUGUST 20, 2002, THE UNAMORTIZED UNEARNED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE AWARDS IS INCLUDED AS UNEARNED COMPENSATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. UNEARNED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO INCOME RATABLY

OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE AFTER-TAX COMPENSATION COST CHARGED TO EARNINGS FOR THESE RESTRICTED STOCK AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS WAS $26 MILLION, $17 MILLION AND $17 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. SEE

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

MARKET

RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND PRICES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER RELEVANT MARKET RATE OR PRICE CHANGES. MARKET RISK IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE VOLATILITY AND

LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE RELATED UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE TRADED. THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES AND HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE CURRENTLY MANAGED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE COMPANYS

MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES, ARE PRIMARILY ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING.

110

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 WAS $64.71

BILLION AND $38.65 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 84% AND 85% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE COMPANYS INVESTED ASSETS WERE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE

COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO EQUITY PRICE RISK IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY HAS NO DIRECT COMMODITY RISK.

THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INTEREST RATE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES. THE PORTFOLIO DURATION RELATIVE TO THE LIABILITIES DURATION IS PRIMARILY MANAGED THROUGH CASH MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND TREASURY FUTURES TRANSACTIONS.

THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK FOR ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT IS INTEREST RATE

RISK AT THE TIME OF REFINANCING. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND EVALUATES REFINANCING OPPORTUNITIES AS MATURITY DATES APPROACH. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS DEBT SEE NOTES 10 AND 11 TO THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK HAVE OCCURRED SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2003. THIS MARKET RISK

EXPOSURE IS CONCENTRATED IN THE COMPANYS INVESTED ASSETS, AND INSURANCE RESERVES, DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. CASH FLOWS FROM THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTS

DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY TO FUND INSURANCE RESERVES AND OTHER LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN THE SAME CURRENCY, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE. INVESTED ASSETS

DENOMINATED IN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 3.5% OF THE TOTAL INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 1.5% OF THE COMPANYS INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS

PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES WERE MANAGED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ITS PRIMARY MARKET RISK

EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS BASED UPON WHAT IS KNOWN OR EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS DEFINED AS THE MEASUREMENT OF POTENTIAL LOSS IN FUTURE EARNINGS, FAIR VALUES OR CASH FLOWS OF MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS

RESULTING FROM ONE OR MORE SELECTED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET RATES OR PRICES OVER A SELECTED TIME. IN THE COMPANYS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET RATES IS SELECTED THAT IS EXPECTED TO

REFLECT REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN THOSE RATES. NEAR-TERM MEANS A PERIOD OF TIME GOING FORWARD UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN

MARKET RATES ASSUMED IN THIS DISCLOSURE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE RESULTS OF ANY ACTIONS THAT WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE COMPANY TO MITIGATE SUCH HYPOTHETICAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE.

INTEREST RATE RISK

IN THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

MODEL INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING: FIXED MATURITIES, NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, MORTGAGE LOANS, SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, DEBT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE PRIMARY MARKET

RISK TO THE COMPANYS MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INTEREST RATE RISK. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USES A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES TO MEASURE THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE

MODEL.

111

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR INVESTED ASSETS WITH PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, ESTIMATES OF PORTFOLIO DURATION AND

CONVEXITY ARE USED TO MODEL THE LOSS OF FAIR VALUE THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM A PARALLEL INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES. DURATIONS ON INVESTED ASSETS ARE ADJUSTED FOR CALL, PUT AND INTEREST RATE RESET FEATURES. DURATIONS ON TAX-EXEMPT

SECURITIES ARE ADJUSTED FOR THE FACT THAT THE YIELDS ON SUCH SECURITIES DO NOT NORMALLY MOVE IN LOCKSTEP WITH CHANGES IN THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE. FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO DURATIONS ARE CALCULATED ON A MARKET VALUE WEIGHTED BASIS, INCLUDING ACCRUED

INTEREST, USING HOLDINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003.

FOR

DEBT, THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY CALCULATING HYPOTHETICAL DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 ENDING PRICES BASED ON YIELDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE, COMPARING SUCH HYPOTHETICAL ENDING PRICES TO ACTUAL ENDING PRICES, AND

MULTIPLYING THE DIFFERENCE BY THE PAR OR SECURITIES OUTSTANDING.

THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USED BY THE COMPANY PRODUCES A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION BASED ON A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004

AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

THE LOSS ESTIMATES DO NOT TAKE INTO

ACCOUNT THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE INTERVENTIONS THAT THE COMPANY MIGHT REASONABLY UNDERTAKE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE OR AVOID LOSSES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM EMERGING INTEREST RATE TRENDS. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS VALUE ONLY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF AN INTEREST

RATE INCREASE ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AS A RESULT, THE LOSS VALUE EXCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WHICH IF INCLUDED IN THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, WOULD

MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS FROM FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS. A HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IS USED TO ESTIMATE

THE IMPACT ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FOREIGN DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. THE POTENTIAL LOSS IS REDUCED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANYS

ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT A HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $438 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RISK WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY). ON

APRIL 1, 2004, TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) MERGED WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. (SPC), AS A RESULT OF WHICH TPC BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THIS

TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE ACQUISITION WITH TPC TREATED AS THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIRER. ACCORDINGLY, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION, USING TPCS HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND APPLYING

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS OF SPC AS OF APRIL 1, 2004. (SEE NOTE 2 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED). BEGINNING ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OF SPC WERE CONSOLIDATED WITH TPCS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ACCORDINGLY, ALL FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTS OF TPC FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED

MARCH 31, 2004 AND THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS OF SPC AND TPC FOR THE SUBSEQUENT NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN FOR 2003 AND 2002 REFLECTS THE ACCOUNTS OF TPC. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE

TO PRIOR YEARS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEARS PRESENTATION. SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, EACH ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARE OF TPC CLASS A AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK (INCLUDING THE

ASSOCIATED PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS) WAS EXCHANGED FOR 0.4334 OF A SHARE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE EXCHANGE OF TPCS COMMON STOCK, PAR

VALUE $0.01 PER SHARE, FOR THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK WITHOUT DESIGNATED PAR VALUE. COMMON STOCK AND ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WERE ALSO RESTATED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE DIFFERENCE IN PAR VALUE OF THE EXCHANGED

SHARES. CASH WAS PAID IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER, HISTORICAL TPC SHAREHOLDERS HELD APPROXIMATELY 66% OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

REGARDING THE MERGER, SEE NOTE 2.

TPC WAS REORGANIZED

IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) ON MARCH 21, 2002. TPC ISSUED COMMON STOCK REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 23% OF TPCS COMMON EQUITY. AFTER THE IPO, CITIGROUP INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, CITIGROUP)

BENEFICIALLY OWNED ALL OF THE 500 MILLION SHARES OF TPCS OUTSTANDING CLASS B COMMON STOCK, EACH SHARE OF WHICH IS ENTITLED TO SEVEN VOTES, AND 269 MILLION SHARES OF TPCS CLASS A COMMON STOCK, EACH SHARE OF WHICH IS ENTITLED TO ONE VOTE,

REPRESENTING AT THE TIME 94% OF THE COMBINED VOTING POWER OF ALL CLASSES OF TPCS VOTING SECURITIES AND 77% OF THE EQUITY INTEREST IN TPC. (ALL CLASS A AND CLASS B SHARE AMOUNTS PRESENTED ARE UNADJUSTED FOR THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC). FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE IPO AND RELATED CORPORATE REORGANIZATION, SEE NOTE 3.

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND CLAIMS AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER

FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

EFFECT OF CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUED EITF 04-8,

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED

GUIDANCE ON THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. EITF 04-8 REQUIRES THAT CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE INCLUDED

IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, UNDER THE IF-CONVERTED METHOD, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE MARKET PRICE TRIGGER HAS BEEN MET. UNDER FAS 128,

EARNINGS PER SHARE

, CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WHICH CONTAIN MARKET PRICE TRIGGERS WERE

EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE UNTIL THE MARKET TRIGGER CONDITIONS WERE MET.

THE COMPANY HAS $893 MILLION OF 4.50% CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES OUTSTANDING WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE NEW EITF 04-8 GUIDANCE. THESE CONVERTIBLE

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES MATURE ON APRIL 15, 2032 UNLESS EARLIER REDEEMED, REPURCHASED OR CONVERTED. THE NOTES ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO APPROXIMATELY 17 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER AFTER MARCH 27, 2003

AND PRIOR TO APRIL 15, 2032 IF AT ANY TIME CERTAIN CONTINGENCY CONDITIONS ARE MET. ON OR AFTER APRIL 18, 2007, THE NOTES MAY BE REDEEMED AT THE COMPANYS OPTION.

EITF 04-8 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS ENDED AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2004 AND REQUIRES RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR PERIOD EARNINGS PER

SHARE FOR COMPARATIVE PERIODS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY HAS RESTATED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR PRIOR PERIODS TO INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THE CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES WHERE THE IMPACT OF INCLUDING THESE SECURITIES WAS DILUTIVE. SEE

NOTE 7 FOR THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE.

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED

REVISED INTERPRETATION NO. 46,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(FIN 46R). FIN 46R, ALONG WITH ITS RELATED INTERPRETATIONS, CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN NO. 51,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS

,

TO CERTAIN ENTITIES IN WHICH EQUITY INVESTORS DO NOT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST OR DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUITY AT RISK FOR THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL

SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT. FIN 46R SEPARATES ENTITIES INTO TWO GROUPS: (1) THOSE FOR WHICH VOTING INTERESTS ARE USED TO DETERMINE CONSOLIDATION AND (2) THOSE FOR WHICH VARIABLE INTERESTS ARE USED TO DETERMINE CONSOLIDATION. FIN 46R CLARIFIES

HOW TO IDENTIFY A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) AND HOW TO DETERMINE WHEN A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE SHOULD INCLUDE THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS AND RESULTS OF ACTIVITIES OF A VIE IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A COMPANY

THAT ABSORBS A MAJORITY OF A VIES EXPECTED LOSSES, RECEIVES A MAJORITY OF A VIES EXPECTED RESIDUAL RETURNS, OR BOTH, IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY AND IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE INTO ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FIN 46R ALSO REQUIRES

DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION WHERE THE REPORTING COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OR HOLDS A SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTEREST IN A VIE (BUT IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY).

FIN 46R IS EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT HAVE INTERESTS IN VIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES FOR

PERIODS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2003. APPLICATION BY PUBLIC COMPANIES FOR ALL OTHER TYPES OF ENTITIES IS REQUIRED FOR PERIODS ENDING AFTER MARCH 15, 2004. THE COMPANY ADOPTED FIN 46R EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2003.

THE COMPANY HOLDS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN HEDGE FUND INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. HEDGE FUNDS ARE UNREGISTERED PRIVATE INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES (LLC), FUNDS OR POOLS THAT MAY

INVEST AND TRADE IN MANY DIFFERENT MARKETS, STRATEGIES AND INSTRUMENTS (INCLUDING SECURITIES, NON-SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES). THREE HEDGE FUNDS WERE DETERMINED TO BE SIGNIFICANT VIES AND HAVE A TOTAL VALUE FOR ALL INVESTORS COMBINED OF

APPROXIMATELY $175 MILLION AND $326 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THESE FUNDS HAS A CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $54 MILLION AND $93 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE

COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT WITH THESE FUNDS BEGAN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002.

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

ON DECEMBER 8, 2003, PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (2003

MEDICARE ACT) INTO LAW. THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT INTRODUCES A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE PART D AS WELL AS A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT

TO MEDICARE PART D. ON JANUARY 12, 2004, FASB ISSUED STAFF POSITION FAS 106-1,

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

(FSP 106-1), WHICH PERMITS SPONSORS OF

RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS TO MAKE A ONE-TIME ELECTION TO DEFER ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT. FASB STAFF POSITION FAS 106-2,

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO

THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

(FSP 106-2), WAS ISSUED ON MAY 19, 2004, SUPERSEDES FSP 106-1 AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT FOR SPONSORS OF RETIREE

HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS. FSP 106-2 ALSO REQUIRES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE EFFECT OF THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY.

THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS AVAILABLE UNDER THE SPC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ARE ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE

PART D AND THUS QUALIFY FOR THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY UNDER THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS THAT THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY WILL OFFSET OR REDUCE THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE COST OF THE UNDERLYING POSTRETIREMENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE ON

WHICH THE SUBSIDY IS BASED. AS A RESULT, THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT WAS REFLECTED IN THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING RE-MEASUREMENT OF THE SPC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ON APRIL 1, 2004. THE EFFECT OF THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS A $29 MILLION

REDUCTION (WITH NO TAX EFFECT) IN THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS OF APRIL 1, 2004 AND A REDUCTION OF $2 MILLION IN NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004.

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS AS DEFINED IN FASB STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

(FAS 123), USING THE PROSPECTIVE RECOGNITION TRANSITION ALTERNATIVE OF

FASB STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. FAS 148,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE

(FAS 148). FAS 123 INDICATES THAT THE FAIR VALUE BASED METHOD IS THE PREFERRED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE

COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO USE THE PROSPECTIVE RECOGNITION TRANSITION ALTERNATIVE OF FAS 148. UNDER THIS ALTERNATIVE ONLY THE AWARDS GRANTED, MODIFIED, OR SETTLED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2003 WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FAIR VALUE METHOD. THE

ADOPTION OF FAS 123 DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 141, 

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

 (FAS 141), AND NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(FAS 142). THESE STANDARDS CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

PROHIBITING THE PROSPECTIVE USE OF POOLING-OF-INTERESTS ACCOUNTING AND REQUIRING COMPANIES TO STOP AMORTIZING GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE CREATED BY BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. INSTEAD, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS DEEMED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE ARE SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT DEEMED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE CONTINUE TO BE

AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES.

DURING THE QUARTER ENDED

MARCH 31, 2002, THE COMPANY PERFORMED THE TRANSITIONAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS USING THE FAIR VALUE APPROACH REQUIRED BY FAS 142. BASED ON THESE TESTS, THE COMPANY IMPAIRED $220 MILLION AFTER TAX OF GOODWILL AND $23 MILLION AFTER TAX OF INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENTING THE VALUE OF INSURANCE OPERATING LICENSES, ALL ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NORTHLAND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (NORTHLAND), AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NORTHLAND REPORTING

UNIT WAS BASED ON THE USE OF A MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF NORTHLANDS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED NET CASH FLOWS. NORTHLAND IS A COMPONENT OF THE COMMERCIAL OPERATING

SEGMENT.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES NOT YET ADOPTED

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED REVISED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STANDARDS NO. 123,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(FAS 123R),

AN AMENDMENT TO FAS 123 AND A REPLACEMENT OF APB OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

, AND ITS RELATED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE. FAS 123R REQUIRES PUBLIC ENTITIES TO MEASURE THE COST OF EMPLOYEE SERVICES RECEIVED IN

EXCHANGE FOR AN AWARD OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD, AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT COST OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD.

AS OF THE REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE, FAS 123R REQUIRES ENTITIES THAT USE THE FAIR-VALUE METHOD OF EITHER RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE UNDER FAS 123, TO APPLY A

MODIFIED VERSION OF THE PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION. UNDER MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION, COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED ON OR AFTER THE REQUIRED EFFECTIVE DATE FOR ALL UNVESTED AWARDS, BASED ON THEIR GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE AS CALCULATED UNDER FAS

123 FOR EITHER RECOGNITION OR PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE PURPOSES. FAS 123R IS EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING UNDER FAS 123 ON JANUARY 1, 2003. THE FAIR VALUE EFFECT OF STOCK OPTIONS IS DERIVED BY THE

APPLICATION OF AN OPTION PRICING MODEL.

THE IMPACT OF FAS 123R WILL BE THE ADDITIONAL EXPENSE RELATING TO UNVESTED AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003 AND WHICH REMAIN OUTSTANDING ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF FAS 123R. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING FAS 123R TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

USING THE RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THE EFFECTIVE YIELD USED TO DETERMINE AMORTIZATION IS CALCULATED BASED UPON ACTUAL HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS, WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM A WIDELY-ACCEPTED SECURITIES DATA PROVIDER. FIXED MATURITIES, INCLUDING INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF INCOME TAXES, CREDITED OR CHARGED DIRECTLY TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE COMMON AND NONREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON QUOTED

MARKET PRICES. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, NET OF INCOME TAX, ARE CHARGED OR CREDITED DIRECTLY TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

MORTGAGE LOANS ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. A MORTGAGE LOAN IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST AMOUNTS DUE. FOR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED, A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST AND FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, THE

COMPANY USES INTEREST RATES REFLECTING THE CURRENT REAL ESTATE FINANCING MARKET RETURNS. IMPAIRED LOANS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003.

THE COMPANYS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE WAREHOUSES AND OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL LAND AND PROPERTIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY OWNED. REAL

ESTATE PROPERTIES ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE SHORTER OF THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OF THE BUILDING OR 39 YEARS. ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ON REAL ESTATE HELD FOR

INVESTMENT PURPOSES WAS $22 MILLION AND $0 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE

OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE

PROPERTY.

RENTAL INCOME IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS

OVER THE LEASE TERM. SEE NOTE 6.

REAL ESTATE HELD FOR SALE IS

CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO SELL. FAIR VALUE IS ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION BY INTERNAL ANALYSIS OR EXTERNAL APPRAISERS, USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND OTHER ACCEPTABLE TECHNIQUES.

THEREAFTER, IMPAIRMENT IS TAKEN IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PROPERTY EXCEEDS ITS CURRENT FAIR VALUE LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO SELL. THE COMPANY HAD NO REAL ESTATE HELD FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AND THE AMOUNT HELD FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2003

WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

ACCRUAL OF INCOME IS SUSPENDED ON FIXED

MATURITIES OR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT ARE IN DEFAULT, OR ON WHICH IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AS SCHEDULED. INTEREST INCOME ON INVESTMENTS IN DEFAULT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY AS PAYMENT IS RECEIVED. INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET THAT WERE NOT INCOME-PRODUCING FOR THE PRECEDING 12 MONTHS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER DEBT ISSUES PURCHASED WITH A MATURITY OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR, ARE CARRIED

AT AMORTIZED COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.

OTHER

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE: VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, THROUGH DIRECT OWNERSHIP AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS; PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS; JOINT VENTURES, OTHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, AND TRADING SECURITIES. VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS OWNED DIRECTLY

ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR JOINT VENTURES, LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY SECURITIES. UNDISTRIBUTED INCOME IS REPORTED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME.

TRADING SECURITIES ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD.

INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF PRETAX REVENUES BASED UPON SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION

OF THE INVESTMENTS SOLD ON THE TRADE DATE. A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF A SECURITY BELOW ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS IS ASSESSED TO DETERMINE IF THE DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. IF SO, THE SECURITY IS DEEMED TO BE IMPAIRED, AND A CHARGE IS RECORDED IN

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE CLAIM LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE REINSURED BUSINESS. SUCH RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES AND AMOUNTS DUE FROM KNOWN REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER

INSOLVENCIES.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

AMOUNTS WHICH VARY WITH AND ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION OF NEW

INSURANCE CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY COMMISSIONS AND PREMIUM TAXES, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED PRO RATA OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS IN WHICH THE RELATED PREMIUMS ARE EARNED. DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS ARE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE RECOVERABLE FROM

FUTURE INCOME, AND IF NOT, ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. FUTURE INVESTMENT INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RELATED PREMIUMS IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MEASURING THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THIS ASSET. ALL OTHER ACQUISITION EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO

OPERATIONS AS INCURRED.

CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

UNDER CERTAIN WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE

CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE POLICYHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. THESE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED ON A GROSS BASIS IN

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES AND CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 141 AND FAS 142 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002. UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 141 AND FAS 142, THE COMPANY STOPPED AMORTIZING GOODWILL. INSTEAD, GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY USING A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE

FIRST STEP IS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT AND, IF NECESSARY, THE SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEASURING THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY. INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT DEEMED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT DEEMED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE IS REGULARLY REVIEWED FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENTS IN VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 144. IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS NOT

RECOVERABLE FROM ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT ESTIMATED PROVISIONS FOR BOTH REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND RELATED EXPENSES. THE

RESERVES ARE ADJUSTED REGULARLY BASED UPON EXPERIENCE.

2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED USING RATES OF 3.5% TO 5.0%. RESERVES RELATED TO CERTAIN FIXED AND DETERMINABLE ASBESTOS-RELATED SETTLEMENTS, WHERE ALL PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND THEIR TIMING ARE KNOWN, WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RANGE OF

INTEREST RATES FROM 2.3% TO 5.5% AND TOTALED $48 MILLION AND $445 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. RESERVES FOR CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE COVERAGE ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, DISCOUNTED USING RATES OF 5.0% TO 7.5%, WERE $116

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

IN DETERMINING CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, THE COMPANY CARRIES ON A CONTINUING REVIEW OF ITS OVERALL POSITION, ITS RESERVING TECHNIQUES AND ITS REINSURANCE. THE RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY A QUALIFIED ACTUARY EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. THESE RESERVES

REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE COST OF ALL INCURRED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. SINCE THE RESERVES ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN SUCH RESERVES. THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATED RESERVES

ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. SUCH CHANGES MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD OCCUR IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE AND DOLLAR-ROLL REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY ENGAGES IN SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES

NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE LENDING OF CERTAIN OF ITS INVESTMENTS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2004, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENT. BORROWERS OF THESE SECURITIES PROVIDE

COLLATERAL EQUAL TO AT LEAST 102% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. THIS COLLATERAL IS HELD BY A THIRD PARTY CUSTODIAN, AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE COLLATERAL ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THE INSTITUTION

BORROWING THE COMPANYS SECURITIES IS IN DEFAULT UNDER THE LENDING AGREEMENT. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RECEIPT OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE THIRD PARTY CUSTODIAN OR THE OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE COLLATERAL. THE LOANED

SECURITIES REMAIN A RECORDED ASSET OF THE COMPANY.

PRIOR TO

APRIL 1, 2004, THE COMPANY ENGAGED IN SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES WHERE IT RECEIVED CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS COLLATERAL. IN THOSE CASES WHERE CASH COLLATERAL WAS RECEIVED, THE COMPANY REINVESTED THE COLLATERAL IN A SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT

POOL, THE LOANED SECURITIES REMAINED A RECORDED ASSET OF THE COMPANY AND A LIABILITY WAS RECORDED TO RECOGNIZE THE COMPANYS OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE COLLATERAL AT THE END OF THE LOAN. WHERE MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAD BEEN RECEIVED AS

COLLATERAL, THE COLLATERAL WAS HELD BY A THIRD PARTY CUSTODIAN, AND THE COMPANY HAD THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE COLLATERAL ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THE INSTITUTION BORROWING THE COMPANYS SECURITIES WAS IN DEFAULT UNDER THE LENDING AGREEMENT. IN

THOSE CASES WHERE MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE RECEIPT OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE THIRD PARTY CUSTODIAN OR THE OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE COLLATERAL. THE LOANED SECURITIES REMAINED A RECORDED

ASSET OF THE COMPANY.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED

FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE AWARDS GRANTED, MODIFIED, OR SETTLED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY

APPLIES THE FAS 123 FAIR VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. UNDER THIS METHOD, COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR RESTRICTED STOCK THE FAIR VALUE IS

MEASURED AT THE MARKET PRICE OF A SHARE ON THE GRANT DATE WHILE FOR STOCK OPTIONS THE FAIR VALUE IS DERIVED BY THE APPLICATION OF AN OPTION PRICING MODEL AT DATE OF GRANT.

FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THESE AWARDS UNDER THE

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION NO. 25 (APB 25), 

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO APPLY THE APB 25 ACCOUNTING

GUIDANCE FOR THESE AWARDS AS THE COMPANY ELECTED TO USE THE PROSPECTIVE RECOGNITION TRANSITION ALTERNATIVE OF FAS 148. UNDER THIS METHOD, COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT GRANT DATE BASED UPON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK AT THE DATE OF

GRANT LESS ANY AMOUNT THAT THE EMPLOYEE IS REQUIRED TO PAY AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR EMPLOYEE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS, THE AWARDS ARE GRANTED AT THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON GRANT DATE AND ACCORDINGLY THE

MARKET VALUE OF THESE AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AWARDS, THE AWARDS ARE GRANTED AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF

THE GRANT AND ACCORDINGLY THERE HAS BEEN NO EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THE STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF THE FAS 123 FAIR VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING ON JANUARY 1, 2003.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN APRIL 2004, THE COMPANY ASSUMED 23 MILLION

OUTSTANDING SPC STOCK OPTIONS, OF WHICH 4 MILLION REMAINED UNVESTED AND ASSUMED APPROXIMATELY 240,000 OF OUTSTANDING SPC RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS RELATED TO SPC EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THESE STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS RETAINED

THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WERE APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE MERGER. AT APRIL 1, 2004, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE UNVESTED STOCK OPTION AWARDS AND THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS WERE $35 MILLION AND $9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED

IN UNEARNED COMPENSATION AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF EQUITY. THE UNEARNED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS BEING RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO INCOME OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD.

ADDITIONALLY, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION IN AUGUST 2002 (DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 3), THE

COMPANY ISSUED REPLACEMENT AWARDS FOR CITIGROUP AWARDS. THESE REPLACEMENT AWARDS WERE ISSUED AT THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF EACH CITIGROUP OPTION AND THE RATIO OF EXERCISE PRICE PER SHARE TO THE MARKET VALUE PER SHARE WAS NOT REDUCED. ACCORDINGLY THERE

WAS NO COMPENSATION COST RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THESE REPLACEMENT AWARDS.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY MAY USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EQUITY SWAPS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, OPTIONS, FORWARD CONTRACTS AND

FINANCIAL FUTURES, AS A MEANS OF HEDGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE, EQUITY PRICE CHANGE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES ALL

DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS, AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND MEASURES THOSE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE. WHERE APPLICABLE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS USED TO ACCOUNT

FOR DERIVATIVES. TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THE CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE MUST BE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET THE CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM. HEDGES ARE MONITORED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN THE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE HEDGED INVESTMENT. DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH THE CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EQUITY SWAPS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, OPTIONS

AND FORWARD CONTRACTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

UPON COMPLETION OF THE

MERGER ON APRIL 1, 2004, THE COMPANY WAS ORGANIZED INTO FOUR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL, SPECIALTY, PERSONAL (THESE THREE SEGMENTS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SEGMENTS) AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. THE INSURANCE

SEGMENTS REFLECT HOW THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND INSURANCE-RELATED SERVICES AND REPRESENT AN AGGREGATION OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BASED ON TYPE OF CUSTOMER, HOW THE BUSINESS IS MARKETED, AND THE MANNER

IN WHICH THE BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENT COMPRISES THE COMPANYS 79% INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED

FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE APRIL 1, 2004 MERGER COMPLETION DATE, SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED FROM THE

HISTORICAL PRESENTATION OF TPC TO CONFORM TO THE NEW SEGMENT PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANY, WHERE PRACTICABLE. AS A RESULT, PRIOR PERIOD BOND AND CONSTRUCTION RESULTS WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM THE HISTORICAL TPC COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT TO THE HISTORICAL

SPECIALTY SEGMENT.

INVESTED AND OTHER ASSETS AND NET

INVESTMENT INCOME (NII) OF HISTORICAL TPC HAD BEEN SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED BY REPORTING SEGMENT PRIOR TO THE MERGER. BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY DEVELOPED A METHODOLOGY TO ALLOCATE NII AND INVESTED ASSETS TO THE IDENTIFIED

SEGMENTS. THIS METHODOLOGY ALLOCATES PRETAX NII BASED UPON AN INVESTABLE FUNDS CONCEPT, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT LIABILITIES (NET OF NON-INVESTED ASSETS) AND APPROPRIATE CAPITAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EACH SEGMENT. THE INVESTMENT YIELD FOR INVESTABLE

FUNDS REFLECTS THE DURATION OF THE LOSS RESERVES FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME THE LOSSES WERE INCURRED AND A+ RATED CORPORATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THIS DURATION YIELD WILL BE COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE PORTFOLIO YIELD

AND A NEW AVERAGE YIELD WILL BE DETERMINED. IT IS THIS AVERAGE YIELD THAT WILL BE USED IN THE CALCULATION OF NII ON INVESTABLE FUNDS. YIELDS WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY. INVESTED ASSETS ARE ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS IN PROPORTION TO THE PRETAX ALLOCATION

OF NII.

IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO APPLY THIS METHODOLOGY TO HISTORICAL BUSINESSES AND, AS SUCH, ACTUAL (VERSUS ALLOCATED) NII IS INCLUDED IN REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME OF THE RESTATED SEGMENTS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO A COMPARISON WITH THE NEW SEGMENT PRESENTATION. IT IS ALSO NOT PRACTICABLE TO PRESENT TOTAL ASSETS FOR RESTATED COMMERCIAL AND SPECIALTY SEGMENTS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER.

THE SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES OF THE COMPANYS FOUR REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

THE ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF THE

COMPANYS MAJORITY INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INC., WHOSE CORE BUSINESSES ARE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND RELATED RESEARCH, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR THE AFFLUENT,

HIGH-NET-WORTH AND INSTITUTIONAL MARKET SEGMENTS. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS DISTRIBUTES ITS INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING INDIVIDUALLY MANAGED ACCOUNTS, CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS AND MUTUAL FUNDS, TO THE AFFLUENT AND HIGH-NET-WORTH

MARKET SEGMENTS THROUGH UNAFFILIATED INTERMEDIARY FIRMS INCLUDING BROKER/DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, AFFILIATES OF INSURANCE PROVIDERS, FINANCIAL PLANNERS, ACCOUNTANTS, CONSULTANTS AND INVESTMENT ADVISORS. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ALSO PROVIDES MANAGED

ACCOUNT SERVICES TO SEVERAL INSTITUTIONAL MARKET SEGMENTS AND CHANNELS. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS MARKETS ITS CAPABILITIES UNDER FOUR DISTINCT BRANDS.

RITTENHOUSE

(BLUE-CHIP GROWTH-STYLE EQUITIES);

NWQ

(VALUE-STYLE EQUITIES);

NUVEEN

SYMPHONY

(AN INSTITUTIONAL MANAGER OF MARKET-NEUTRAL ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS). NUVEEN INVESTMENTS IS LISTED ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, TRADING UNDER THE SYMBOL JNC. THE

COMPANYS INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS WAS APPROXIMATELY 79% AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE

THE COMPANY HAS GEOGRAPHIC EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL AND MAN-MADE EVENTS INCLUDING HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER,

EXPLOSIONS AND FIRES. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF

THE EVENT. MOST CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS; HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO REDUCE ITS

EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE.

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 (THE TERRORISM ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW AND ESTABLISHED THE TERRORISM INSURANCE

PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM), A TEMPORARY FEDERAL PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THAT PROVIDES FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A

FOREIGN INTEREST. IN ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS AN ACT

OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF TREASURY. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE

TERRORISM ACT. THE TERRORISM ACT GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM TERMINATES ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER IS

ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR 90% OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP. IN EACH CASE, THE DEDUCTIBLE PERCENTAGE IS APPLIED TO THE INSURERS SUBJECT DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS FROM THE

CALENDAR YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE YEAR. THE DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM WAS 7% FOR 2003, 10% FOR 2004 AND IS 15% FOR 2005. THE PROGRAM ALSO CONTAINS AN ANNUAL CAP THAT LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL

PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE $100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE U.S. TREASURY AND AN INSURER THAT HAS MET ITS DEDUCTIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM YEAR IS

NOT LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES (OR PORTION THEREOF) THAT EXCEED THE $100 BILLION CAP. THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM IS $2.51 BILLION FOR 2005. THE COMPANY HAD NO TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES IN 2004 OR 2003. IF THE

PROGRAM IS NOT RENEWED FOR PERIODS AFTER JANUARY 1, 2006, THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANY WILL BE SUBJECT TO LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM SUBJECT ONLY TO THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE

POLICIES.

MERGER AND ACQUISITION

MERGER WITH SPC

ON APRIL 1, 2004, TPC MERGED WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF SPC, AS A RESULT OF WHICH TPC BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC.

FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE ACQUISITION WITH TPC TREATED AS THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIRER. ACCORDINGLY, THIS TRANSACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION, USING TPCS HISTORICAL

FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND APPLYING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TO THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS OF SPC AS OF APRIL 1, 2004.

DETERMINATION OF PURCHASE PRICE

THE STOCK PRICE USED IN DETERMINING THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS BASED ON AN AVERAGE OF THE CLOSING PRICES OF SPC COMMON STOCK FOR THE TWO TRADING DAYS BEFORE

THROUGH THE TWO TRADING DAYS AFTER SPC AND TPC ANNOUNCED THEIR MERGER AGREEMENT ON NOVEMBER 17, 2003. THE PURCHASE PRICE ALSO INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SPC STOCK OPTIONS, THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO SPCS PREFERRED STOCK, AND OTHER COSTS

MERGER AND ACQUISITION, CONTINUED

THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE ACQUISITION WERE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A) TO CREATE A STRONGER COMPANY

THAT WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND TO CUSTOMERS ALIKE; B) TO CAPITALIZE ON A COMMON STRATEGIC FOCUS ON DELIVERING THE HIGHEST VALUE TO CUSTOMERS, AGENTS AND BROKERS AND, WORKING TOGETHER, TO EXPAND FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND

CAPTURE NEW EFFICIENCIES; AND C) TO STRENGTHEN THE COMBINED COMPANYS POSITION AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS.

(7)

AN ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO SPCS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AT THE ACQUISITION DATE TO ESTIMATE THEIR

FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT OF $191 MILLION WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF NOMINAL CLAIM AND CLAIM EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES (AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFORMITY WITH THE ACQUIRERS ACCOUNTING POLICY ON

DISCOUNTING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION RESERVES), EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERNS, THE APRIL 1, 2004 U.S. TREASURY SPOT RATE YIELD CURVE, A LEVERAGE RATIO ASSUMPTION (RESERVES TO STATUTORY SURPLUS), AND A COST OF CAPITAL EXPRESSED AS A SPREAD OVER

RISK-FREE RATES. THE METHOD USED CALCULATES A RISK ADJUSTMENT TO A RISK-FREE DISCOUNTED RESERVE THAT WILL, IF RESERVES RUN OFF AS EXPECTED, PRODUCE RESULTS THAT YIELD THE ASSUMED COST-OF-CAPITAL ON THE CAPITAL

CITIGROUP INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, CITIGROUP), OTHER THAN THE CAPITAL STOCK OF TRAVELERS INSURANCE GROUP HOLDINGS INC. (TIGHI). CITIGROUP ALSO ASSUMED ALL OF TPCS THIRD-PARTY LIABILITIES, OTHER THAN LIABILITIES

EQUITY INTEREST IN TPC. (ALL CLASS A AND CLASS B SHARE AMOUNTS PRESENTED ARE UNADJUSTED FOR THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC). CONCURRENT WITH THE IPO, TPC ISSUED $893 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.5% CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES WHICH

MATURE ON APRIL 15, 2032. THE IPO AND THE OFFERING OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE OFFERINGS.

PURSUANT TO TPCS CORPORATE REORGANIZATION, WHICH WAS COMPLETED ON MARCH 19, 2002, TPCS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE ADJUSTED TO

EXCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN FORMERLY WHOLLY-OWNED TPC SUBSIDIARIES, PRINCIPALLY THE TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY (TIC) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, CERTAIN OTHER WHOLLY-OWNED NONINSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES OF TPC AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF TPCS ASSETS

AND CERTAIN LIABILITIES NOT RELATED TO THE PROPERTY CASUALTY BUSINESS.

ON AUGUST 20, 2002, CITIGROUP MADE A

COMBINED VOTING POWER OF TPCS OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES. FOR EACH 100 SHARES OF CITIGROUP OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, APPROXIMATELY 4.32 SHARES OF TPC CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND 8.88 SHARES OF TPC CLASS B COMMON STOCK WERE DISTRIBUTED. AT

INVESTMENTS, CONTINUED

THE COMPANY MAKES INVESTMENTS IN COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) THAT TYPICALLY HAVE HIGH

CREDIT QUALITY, OFFER GOOD LIQUIDITY AND ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE AN ADVANTAGE IN YIELD COMPARED TO U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO PURCHASE CMO TRANCHES WHICH OFFER THE MOST FAVORABLE RETURN GIVEN THE RISKS

INVOLVED. ONE SIGNIFICANT RISK EVALUATED IS PREPAYMENT SENSITIVITY. THE COMPANY DOES INVEST IN OTHER TYPES OF CMO TRANCHES IF A CAREFUL ASSESSMENT INDICATES A FAVORABLE RISK/RETURN TRADEOFF. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PURCHASE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN CMOS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY HELD CMOS

CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $3.30 BILLION AND $3.06 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY (EXCLUDING COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES OF $953 MILLION AND $875 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY). APPROXIMATELY 53% AND 60% OF THE COMPANYS CMO

HOLDINGS ARE GUARANTEED BY OR FULLY COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES ISSUED BY GNMA, FNMA OR FHLMC AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HELD $4.66 BILLION AND $3.80 BILLION OF GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC OR FHA MORTGAGE-BACKED

PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE RATED AAA.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD $2.60 BILLION OF SECURITIES ON LOAN AS PART OF A TRI-PARTY LENDING AGREEMENT, AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY

HAD $562 MILLION OF SECURITIES ON LOAN FOR WHICH CASH COLLATERAL WAS RECEIVED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, $32 MILLION AND $135 MILLION OF SECURITIES WERE SUBJECT TO DOLLAR-ROLL REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF FIXED MATURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE WERE

$7.95 BILLION, $8.34 BILLION AND $12.52 BILLION IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS GAINS OF $202 MILLION, $282 MILLION AND $571 MILLION AND GROSS LOSSES OF $126 MILLION, $147 MILLION AND $148 MILLION WERE REALIZED ON THOSE SALES IN 2004,

2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND

2003, THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD $3.39 BILLION AND $2.37 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES ON DEPOSIT AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN CERTAIN STATES PURSUANT TO THE RESPECTIVE STATES INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

RE-U.K., AND THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS (ALL ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER) ARE REQUIRED, AS ACCREDITED U.S. REINSURERS, TO HOLD CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN TRUST IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE TRUST FUNDS HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $359 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004. ADDITIONALLY, UNIONAMERICA, ST. PAUL RE-U.K. AND DISCOVER RE HAVE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH THIRD PARTIES TO BE USED AS COLLATERAL TO SECURE VARIOUS LIABILITIES ON BEHALF OF INSUREDS, CEDANTS AND OTHER CREDITORS. THESE FUNDS HAD A FAIR

IMPAIRMENTS

FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES

AN INVESTMENT IN A FIXED MATURITY OR EQUITY SECURITY WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR

SALE IS IMPAIRED IF ITS FAIR VALUE FALLS BELOW ITS BOOK VALUE AND THE DECLINE IS CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE LENGTH OF TIME AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH

FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY.

ADDITIONALLY, FOR CERTAIN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH CONTRACTUAL CASH

FLOWS (INCLUDING ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), EITF 99-20,

RECOGNITION OF INTEREST INCOME AND IMPAIRMENT ON PURCHASED AND RETAINED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS,

REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PERIODICALLY UPDATE ITS BEST ESTIMATE

OF CASH FLOWS OVER THE LIFE OF THE SECURITY. IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND THERE HAS BEEN A DECREASE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS SINCE THE

LAST REVISED ESTIMATE, CONSIDERING BOTH TIMING AND AMOUNT, THEN AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED.

INVESTMENTS, CONTINUED

A FIXED MATURITY SECURITY IS IMPAIRED IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT

ALL AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SECURITYS CONTRACTUAL TERMS. EQUITY SECURITIES ARE IMPAIRED WHEN IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOVER ITS COST OVER THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD. FURTHER, FOR SECURITIES EXPECTED TO BE SOLD, AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY TO RECOVER PRIOR TO THE EXPECTED DATE OF SALE.

THE COMPANYS PROCESS FOR REVIEWING INVESTED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENTS DURING ANY QUARTER INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING.



IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF INVESTMENTS WHICH HAVE POSSIBLE INDICATIONS OF IMPAIRMENT;



ANALYSIS OF INVESTMENTS WITH GROSS UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES THAT HAVE FAIR VALUES LESS THAN 80% OF AMORTIZED COST DURING SUCCESSIVE QUARTERLY PERIODS OVER A ROLLING ONE-YEAR

PERIOD;



REVIEW OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS BASED ON THE INVESTEES CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, NEAR-TERM RECOVERY PROSPECTS

AND OTHER FACTORS, AS WELL AS CONSIDERATION OF OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT WERE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS;



CONSIDERATION OF EVIDENTIAL MATTER, INCLUDING AN EVALUATION OF FACTORS OR TRIGGERS THAT WOULD OR COULD CAUSE INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENTS TO QUALIFY AS HAVING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS AND THOSE THAT WOULD NOT SUPPORT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT; AND



DETERMINATION OF THE STATUS OF EACH ANALYZED INVESTMENT AS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY OR NOT, WITH DOCUMENTATION OF THE RATIONALE FOR THE DECISION.

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED IN THE

MERGER, WHICH ARE GENERALLY NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INSTRUMENTS IN EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES AND, HISTORICALLY, HAVING A HOLDING PERIOD OF FOUR TO SEVEN YEARS. THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN MADE IN THE HEALTH CARE, SOFTWARE AND COMPUTER SERVICES,

AND NETWORKING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES INFRASTRUCTURES INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY IS INVOLVED WITH VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES EARLY IN THEIR FORMATION, AS THEY ARE DEVELOPING AND DETERMINING THE VIABILITY OF, AND MARKET DEMAND FOR, THEIR

PRODUCT. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES TO RECORD REVENUES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT, WHICH CAN OFTEN TAKE THREE TO FOUR YEARS, AND DOES NOT GENERALLY EXPECT THEM TO BECOME PROFITABLE FOR AN

EVEN LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS VALUATION OF SUCH NON-PUBLICLY TRADED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AS WELL AS AN INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE REVIEW AND CONSIDER A VARIETY OF

FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



THE ISSUERS MOST RECENT FINANCING EVENTS;



AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER FUNDAMENTAL DETERIORATION HAS OCCURRED;



WHETHER OR NOT THE ISSUERS PROGRESS HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN EXPECTED;



WHETHER OR NOT THE VALUATIONS HAVE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE ENTITYS MARKET SECTOR;



WHETHER OR NOT THE INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE BELIEVES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ISSUER WILL NEED FINANCING WITHIN SIX MONTHS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN OUR CARRYING VALUE; AND



WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY, ENABLING IT TO RECEIVE VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER

THAN OUR COST.

REINSURANCE

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF ASSUMED AND CEDED REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. ASSUMED REINSURANCE REFERS TO THE

ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS THAT OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN. CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES TRANSFERRING CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS (ALONG WITH THE RELATED WRITTEN AND EARNED PREMIUMS) THE COMPANY HAS UNDERWRITTEN TO OTHER

INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO AGREE TO SHARE THESE RISKS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF CEDED REINSURANCE IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT IT IS PREPARED TO ACCEPT. REINSURANCE IS PLACED ON BOTH A QUOTA-SHARE AND EXCESS OF

LOSS BASIS. CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT DISCHARGE THE COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY INSURER, EXCEPT FOR CASES INVOLVING A NOVATION.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO

SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF

THESE REINSURANCE COVERAGE DISPUTES. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO DETERMINE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY

EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS THROUGH ASSUMED REINSURANCE, PRINCIPALLY WITH REGARD TO

RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS IN WORKERS COMPENSATION. THE COMPANY PROVIDES SERVICES FOR SEVERAL OF THESE INVOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS (MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS) UNDER WHICH IT WRITES SUCH RESIDUAL MARKET BUSINESS DIRECTLY, THEN

CEDES 100% OF THIS BUSINESS TO THE MANDATORY POOL. SUCH SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ARRANGED TO PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM ANY CREDIT RISK, AS ANY CEDED BALANCES ARE JOINTLY BACKED BY ALL THE POOL MEMBERS.

THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR

ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ONGOING REVIEW OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND

OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES. AMOUNTS DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE,

INCLUDING AMOUNTS DUE FROM KNOWN INSOLVENT REINSURERS, ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. ANY SUBSEQUENT COLLECTIONS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF ARE REPORTED AS PART OF UNDERWRITING

RESULTS.

THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES WAS $751 MILLION AND $387 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND DECEMBER 31, 2003, RESPECTIVELY. OF THE $364 MILLION INCREASE IN 2004, $256 MILLION WAS MERGER-RELATED AND $108 MILLION RESULTED FROM THE COMPANYS ONGOING REVIEW PROCESS

DESCRIBED ABOVE.

THE COMPANY ASSUMED 100% OF THE WORKERS

COMPENSATION PREMIUMS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN BY THE ACCIDENT DEPARTMENT OF ITS FORMER AFFILIATE, THE TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY (TIC).

CERTAIN OF THE ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS THAT THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO WITH NON-AFFILIATED COMPANIES ON AN EXCESS OF LOSS BASIS DO NOT TRANSFER

INSURANCE RISK. THESE CONTRACTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTING AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND TOTALED $405 MILLION AND $325 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY ENTERED

INTO COMMUTATION AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER, EFFECTIVE JUNE 30, 2004, RESULTING IN A CHARGE OF $153 MILLION FOR AMOUNTS RECEIVED LESS THAN THE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE BALANCES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.26 BILLION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

COMMUTATION, THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERED INTO A NEW REINSURANCE AGREEMENT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2004, THAT PROVIDES $300 MILLION AGGREGATE COVERAGE FOR THE 2000 ACCIDENT YEAR EXPOSURES WRITTEN BY SPC. BECAUSE THE NEW AGREEMENT IS FOR EVENTS OCCURRING

PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT, THE RESULTING $59 MILLION GAIN HAS BEEN DEFERRED AND WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS AMOUNTS ARE RECOVERED FROM THE REINSURER. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NET CASH OF

APPROXIMATELY $867 MILLION.

IN 1996, LLOYDS OF LONDON

(LLOYDS) RESTRUCTURED ITS OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 1993 AND REINSURED THESE CLAIMS INTO EQUITAS LIMITED (EQUITAS). AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM UNAFFILIATED INSURERS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 INCLUDED $90 MILLION

AND $269 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RECOVERABLE FROM EQUITAS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, TPC ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE REINSURANCE CLAIMS AGAINST CERTAIN UNDERWRITERS AT LLOYDS REINSURED BY EQUITAS. UNDER

TERMS OF THIS SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $245 MILLION, RESOLVING APPROXIMATELY $255 MILLION OF TPCS NET CLAIM BALANCES FROM EQUITAS. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE $90 MILLION REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES RELATING TO EQUITAS REMAINING AT DECEMBER 31,

2004 RELATE TO SPC.

2004 WERE $5.85 BILLION.

GROSS CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 INCREASED BY $24.51 BILLION OVER YEAR-END 2003, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER WITH SPC AND RESERVE CHARGES RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MERGER. OF THE INCREASE IN 2004, $19.50 BILLION RESULTED

FROM THE ADDITION OF THE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS, AND $2.40 BILLION WAS DUE TO ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IN 2003

FROM 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET PRIOR YEAR RESERVE STRENGTHENING, PRINCIPALLY IN COMMERCIAL, AND GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME IN BOTH COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE ABOVE WERE NET PAYMENTS OF $607 MILLION IN 2003 AND $522 MILLION

IN 2002 FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, AND FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT FOR PERSONAL.

PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT

IN 2004, ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS TOTALED A NET $2.40 BILLION,

INCLUDING $2.39 BILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IMPACTING THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING $75 MILLION OF ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT. PRETAX NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDED $928 MILLION

TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL ASBESTOS LIABILITY REVIEW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, $290 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER OF

$500 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION AND $300 MILLION FOR SURETY, $252 MILLION RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR, $113 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER, AND OTHER NET RESERVING ACTIONS

THE ASBESTOS PROVISION PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION

COSTS AND ACTIVITY SURROUNDING PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. WITH REGARD TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISION, NEW CLAIMS FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE AND POLLUTION CONTINUE TO DECLINE, THOUGH THE PACE OF THE DECREASE HAS SLOWED. THE AVERAGE SEVERITY OF CLAIMS HAS

INCREASED, HOWEVER, LEADING THE COMPANY TO CONCLUDE THAT RESERVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES NEEDED TO BE INCREASED. THE MAJORITY OF THE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISION IS INCLUDED IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT. ALSO INCLUDED IN NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $1.18 BILLION IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT WAS $38 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A MAJOR REINSURER ALONG WITH A STRENGTHENING OF GULF RESERVES, WHICH WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN CORE COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN THE FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED LOSSES.

THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT RECORDED PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $1.59 BILLION AND INCLUDED $500 MILLION AND $300 MILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND SURETY RESERVES, RESPECTIVELY, ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, AS WELL AS A $252 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR AND $75 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMMUTATION OF AGREEMENTS WITH A

MAJOR REINSURER. RESULTS IN 2004 ALSO REFLECTED $150 MILLION OF UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN TPCS CONSTRUCTION OPERATION PRIOR TO THE MERGER, OTHER RESERVE INCREASES, AND A CHARGE TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCE FOR

ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DUE FROM A CO-SURETY ON A SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR CLAIM.

IN THE PERSONAL SEGMENT, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS $378 MILLION, DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN THE FREQUENCY OF NON-CATASTROPHE HOMEOWNERS LOSSES, AS WELL AS A REDUCTION IN THE FREQUENCY AND

SEVERITY OF LOSSES IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS.

IN

2003, NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDED IN ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TOTALED $390 MILLION. THAT AMOUNT INCLUDED $549 MILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IMPACTING THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THAT PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM $521 MILLION OF RESERVE STRENGTHENING AT GULF INSURANCE COMPANY, A SUBSIDIARY THAT WROTE SPECIALTY INSURANCE PRIOR TO BEING PLACED IN RUNOFF IN 2004. THE NET 2003 TOTAL ALSO INCLUDED UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO

AMERICAN EQUITY, AN OPERATION THAT WAS PLACED IN RUN-OFF IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THOSE PROVISIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IN OTHER COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES, PRINCIPALLY PROPERTY COVERAGES, IN

WHICH THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED LOWER NON-CATASTROPHE-RELATED CLAIM FREQUENCY. IN 2003, ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS INCLUDED $42 MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON COMMERCIAL LOSS

SENSITIVE POLICIES IN VARIOUS LINES; HOWEVER, SINCE THE BUSINESS TO WHICH IT RELATES WAS SUBJECT TO PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, PERSONAL RECORDED $162 MILLION IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2003 PRINCIPALLY DUE TO

CONTINUED REDUCED LEVELS OF NON-CATASTROPHE CLAIM FREQUENCY IN BOTH HOMEOWNERS AND NON-BODILY INJURY AUTOMOBILE BUSINESSES, AND A $50 MILLION REDUCTION IN RESERVES HELD RELATED TO THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.

INSURANCE CLAIMS RESERVES, CONTINUED

IN 2002, ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS WAS A NET

UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF $3.03 BILLION. THIS INCLUDED $3.13 BILLION OF NET UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT WHICH IMPACTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF $2.95 BILLION RELATED TO ASBESTOS. CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS

FOR 2002 ALSO INCLUDED UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF $150 MILLION RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF $100 MILLION RELATED TO CUMULATIVE INJURY CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS

ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS INCLUDED NET UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY RELATED TO CERTAIN COMMERCIAL COVERAGES, PREDOMINANTLY IN ASSUMED REINSURANCE SPECIALTY BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IN COMMERCIAL WORKERS

COMPENSATION AND PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE. IN 2002, ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS INCLUDED $71 MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON COMMERCIAL LOSS SENSITIVE POLICIES IN VARIOUS LINES; HOWEVER,

SINCE THE BUSINESS TO WHICH IT RELATES IS SUBJECT TO PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, THERE IS NO IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS BETWEEN ACCIDENT YEARS OF LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, PURSUANT TO

REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, ARE INCLUDED IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS AND DID NOT IMPACT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACQUIRED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AS OF

APRIL 1, 2004, THE MERGER DATE, ARE REPORTED AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE EXPECTED PAYOUT PERIOD OF THE ACQUIRED RESERVES. SEE NOTE 2.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANYS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INCLUDED $4.57 BILLION AND $3.27 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS, NET OF REINSURANCE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS DUE TO THE VAGARIES OF COURT COVERAGE DECISIONS, PLAINTIFFS EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, THE RISKS INHERENT IN MAJOR LITIGATION AND OTHER

UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE WHICH ARE SET FORTH BELOW.

BECAUSE EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY EVALUATES THE ASBESTOS EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER ON A POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS. IN THE COURSE

OF THIS EVALUATION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF EACH POLICYHOLDERS POTENTIAL

LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF

ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION

CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM. WHEN THE GROSS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR INDEMNITY AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE IS DETERMINED FOR A POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY CALCULATES, BY EACH POLICY

YEAR, A CEDED REINSURANCE PROJECTION BASED ON ANY APPLICABLE FACULTATIVE AND TREATY REINSURANCE, AS WELL AS PAST CEDED EXPERIENCE AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES. THE

COMPANYS EVALUATIONS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN ANY DATA FROM WHICH A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY PAYMENT MAY BE DETERMINED.

WITH RESPECT TO ASBESTOS EXPOSURES, THE COMPANY ALSO COMPARES ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE, YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY

EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. NET ASBESTOS LOSSES AND EXPENSES PAID IN 2004 WERE $301 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $452

MILLION IN 2003. APPROXIMATELY 22% IN 2004 AND 57% IN 2003 OF TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES RELATE TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD LIMIT THE COMPANYS LIABILITY. THE DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF NET PAID SETTLEMENTS TO TOTAL PAID LOSSES IN 2004 PRIMARILY REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN REINSURANCE BILLINGS IN 2004, WHICH RELATED TO GROSS PAYMENTS

MADE IN PRIOR PERIODS. IN 2004, GROSS PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS TOTALED $199 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $289 MILLION IN 2003.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, ASBESTOS RESERVES, NET OF REINSURANCE, WERE $3.93 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $2.98 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2003. THE COMPANY ACQUIRED $311 MILLION OF NET ASBESTOS RESERVES IN THE MERGER WITH SPC. NET INCURRED ASBESTOS LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TOTALED $928 MILLION IN 2004, DRIVEN BY A $922 MILLION PROVISION TO STRENGTHEN RESERVES IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL GROUND-UP REVIEW OF ASBESTOS EXPOSURES. THAT REVIEW INCLUDED AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, STATE JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. THE $922 MILLION PROVISION WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN LITIGATION COSTS AND ACTIVITY SURROUNDING PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, ASBESTOS RESERVES WERE $2.98 BILLION COMPARED TO $3.40

BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE $452 MILLION OF PAYMENTS MADE DURING THE COURSE OF 2003, PARTLY OFFSET BY ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS OF $25 MILLION ON RESERVES FOR CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS WITH STRUCTURED AGREEMENTS.

OTHER THAN ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS, THERE WERE NO ADDITIONS TO ASBESTOS RESERVES IN 2003 COMPARED TO AN ADDITION OF $2.95 BILLION IN 2002.

IN MARCH 2002, CITIGROUP ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH IT PROVIDED TPC WITH FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION, IN ANY

YEAR THAT TPCS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES RECORD ASBESTOS-RELATED INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES IN EXCESS OF $150 MILLION, NET OF ANY REINSURANCE, UP TO A CUMULATIVE AGGREGATE OF $800 MILLION, REDUCED BY THE TAX EFFECT OF THE HIGHEST APPLICABLE FEDERAL

INCOME TAX RATE. DURING 2002, TPC RECORDED $2.95 BILLION OF ASBESTOS INCURRED LOSSES, NET OF REINSURANCE, AND ACCORDINGLY HAS FULLY UTILIZED THE TOTAL BENEFIT AVAILABLE UNDER THE AGREEMENT.

IN ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE

PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF SIMILAR

EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE ALLEGATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF

THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE,

INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO

ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES. IN 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $290 MILLION, NET OF REINSURANCE, TO INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES DUE TO REVISED ESTIMATES OF COSTS RELATED TO RECENT SETTLEMENT INITIATIVES. NET ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES PAID

WERE $152 MILLION, $155 MILLION AND $161 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN

FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS PRESENTLY

NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING

UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN MAJOR LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR

DECREASE IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHICH CANNOT NOW BE ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR

ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER

REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SEES, AS AN EMERGING TREND, AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF THE EXHAUSTION OR UNAVAILABILITY DUE TO

INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURANCE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS ALONG WITH THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LARGE COVERAGE

DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN

INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS RESERVES, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANNUAL GROUND-UP REVIEW OF ASBESTOS POLICYHOLDERS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO

STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE.

THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

IN FUTURE PERIODS.

DESCRIPTION OF DEBT

COMMERCIAL PAPER

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN $800 MILLION

COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM WITH $1 BILLION OF BACK-UP LIQUIDITY, CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF BANK CREDIT AGREEMENTS. INTEREST RATES ON COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED IN 2004 RANGED FROM 1.1% TO 2.8%.

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 BEAR INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 6.4%

TO 7.4%, WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE RATE OF 6.8%. MATURITIES RANGE FROM 5 TO 15 YEARS AFTER THE ISSUANCE DATES. DURING 2004, MEDIUM-TERM NOTES HAVING A PAR VALUE OF $59 MILLION MATURED OR WERE REPURCHASED.

5.25% SENIOR NOTES

IN JULY 2002, CONCURRENT WITH THE ISSUANCE OF

17.8 MILLION OF SPC COMMON SHARES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING, SPC ISSUED 8.9 MILLION EQUITY UNITS, EACH HAVING A STATED AMOUNT OF $50, FOR GROSS CONSIDERATION OF $443 MILLION. EACH EQUITY UNIT INITIALLY CONSISTS OF A FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACT FOR THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK (MATURING IN JULY 2005), AND AN UNSECURED $50 SENIOR NOTE OF THE COMPANY (MATURING IN 2007). TOTAL ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE EQUITY UNITS ARE AT THE RATE OF 9.00%, CONSISTING OF INTEREST ON THE NOTE AT A RATE OF 5.25%

AND FEE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FORWARD CONTRACT OF 3.75%. THE FORWARD CONTRACT REQUIRES THE INVESTOR TO PURCHASE, FOR $50, A VARIABLE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF AUGUST 16, 2005. THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO

BE PURCHASED WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON A FORMULA THAT CONSIDERS THE AVERAGE TRADING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT IN RELATION TO THE $24.20 PER SHARE PRICE OF COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE

OFFERING. HAD THE SETTLEMENT DATE BEEN DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY 15 MILLION COMMON SHARES BASED ON THE AVERAGE TRADING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THAT DATE.

NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY BY PAYING A MAKE-WHOLE PREMIUM BASED ON U.S. TREASURY RATES. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE NOTES WERE CONTRIBUTED TO TIGHI, SO THAT TIGHI COULD PREPAY AND REFINANCE $500 MILLION OF 3.60% INDEBTEDNESS TO

CITIGROUP AND TO REDEEM $900 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF TIGHIS 8.00% TO 8.08% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES HELD BY SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS. THESE TRUSTS, IN TURN, USED THESE FUNDS TO REDEEM $900 MILLION OF PREFERRED CAPITAL

THESE SENIOR NOTES WERE SOLD TO

QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS AS DEFINED UNDER RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE SECURITIES ACT) AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN RELIANCE ON REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. ACCORDINGLY, THE NOTES (THE RESTRICTED NOTES) WERE

THE OPTION TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE NOTES FOR A PERIOD NOT EXCEEDING 20 CONSECUTIVE INTEREST PERIODS NOR BEYOND THE MATURITY OF THE NOTES. DURING A DEFERRAL PERIOD, THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST DUE TO HOLDERS OF THE NOTES WILL CONTINUE TO

ACCUMULATE, AND SUCH DEFERRED INTEREST PAYMENTS WILL THEMSELVES ACCRUE INTEREST. DEFERRAL OF ANY INTEREST CAN CREATE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS FOR THE COMPANY. UNLESS PREVIOUSLY REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED, THE NOTES ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDERS AT ANY TIME AFTER MARCH 27, 2003 AND PRIOR TO APRIL 15, 2032 IF AT ANY TIME (1) THE AVERAGE OF THE DAILY CLOSING PRICES OF COMMON STOCK FOR THE 20 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE CONVERSION DATE

IF THE COMPANY

DETERMINES THAT ANY OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT RESULT IN FUTURE TAX BENEFITS, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE MUST BE ESTABLISHED FOR THE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED. THE NET CHANGE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WAS AN INCREASE OF $128 MILLION IN 2004 RELATING TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS. BASED PREDOMINANTLY UPON A REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS ANTICIPATED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, BUT ALSO INCLUDING ALL OTHER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND

NEGATIVE, THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD A NET OPERATING LOSS (NOL) CARRYFORWARD OF $1.39 BILLION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TAX SHARING AGREEMENT WITH

CITIGROUP, THE COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO CARRY OPERATING LOSSES BACK TO PRIOR YEARS UPON RECEIVING CITIGROUPS CONSENT. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY RECEIVED CITIGROUPS CONSENT AND, AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS DEFERRED

TAX ASSET WAS REDUCED BY $487 MILLION WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION TO THE CURRENT FEDERAL INCOME TAX PAYABLE (INCLUDED IN OTHER CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS). ON JUNE 9, 2003, THE COMPANY

RECEIVED A FEDERAL INCOME TAX REFUND OF $531 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED THE UTILIZATION OF THE NOL CARRYFORWARD.

FOR THE PERIOD ENDING MARCH 27, 2002, THE COMPANY WAS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN FILED BY CITIGROUP. CITIGROUP ALLOCATED

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES ON A SEPARATE RETURN BASIS ADJUSTED FOR CREDITS AND OTHER AMOUNTS REQUIRED BY THE CONSOLIDATION PROCESS. ANY RESULTING LIABILITY WAS PAID CURRENTLY TO CITIGROUP. ANY CREDIT FOR LOSSES WAS PAID BY CITIGROUP

CURRENTLY TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH CREDITS WERE FOR TAX BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN UTILIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.

AS OF MARCH 28, 2002, AS A RESULT OF THE IPO, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER INCLUDED IN THE CITIGROUP CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. AS OF THAT DATE,

THE COMPANY BEGAN FILING ITS OWN CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. THE COMPANYS INTERCOMPANY TAX SHARING AGREEMENT WAS AMENDED TO INCLUDE THE SPC COMPANIES EFFECTIVE WITH THEIR ACQUISITION ON APRIL 1, 2004.

FOR TAX RETURN PURPOSES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD NOL CARRYFORWARDS THAT EXPIRE, IF

UNUSED, IN 2017-2021 AND FOREIGN TAX CREDIT (FTC) CARRYFORWARDS THAT EXPIRE, IF UNUSED, IN 2009-2013. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REALIZING THE BENEFITS OF NOL AND FTC CARRYFORWARDS DEPEND ON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY TAX LAWS.

THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF THOSE NOLS ON A REGULAR TAX BASIS AND AN ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX (AMT) BASIS WERE $2.09 BILLION AND $276 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF THE FTCS BOTH ON A REGULAR TAX BASIS AND AN AMT BASIS WERE $27

MILLION. THE BENEFITS OF THE NOL AND FTC CARRYFORWARDS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON $149 MILLION OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, AS

SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE OPERATIONS. FURTHERMORE, ANY TAXES PAID TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ON THESE EARNINGS MAY BE USED AS CREDITS AGAINST THE U.S. TAX ON ANY DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SUCH EARNINGS.

TAXES ON THE GAAP BASIS IN EXCESS OF TAX BASIS OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.96 BILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS MAJORITY OWNERSHIP OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN JANUARY 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES TO DIVEST ITS

MAJORITY OWNERSHIP POSITION IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A TRANSACTION THAT IS TAX-FREE, TAXABLE, OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS

TIGHI, IN 1996, FORMED STATUTORY SUBSIDIARY BUSINESS TRUSTS UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WHICH ISSUED TRUST SECURITIES REPRESENTING UNDIVIDED

BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THE ASSETS OF THE TRUST. THE GROSS PROCEEDS OF THE TRUST SECURITIES WERE INVESTED IN JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES (JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES) OF ITS PARENT (TPC). ON APRIL 9, 2003, TIGHI REDEEMED

THE $900 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL OF THE TIGHI 8.00% TO 8.08% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES HELD BY THE SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS. THE SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS, IN TURN, USED THESE FUNDS TO REDEEM THE $900 MILLION LIQUIDATION VALUE OF THE TRUST SECURITIES.

PREFERRED STOCK

THE COMPANYS PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY REPRESENTS THE PAR

VALUE OF PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING THAT THE COMPANY ASSUMED IN THE MERGER RELATED TO THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP) TRUST, LESS THE REMAINING PRINCIPAL BALANCE ON THE SOP TRUST DEBT. THE SOP TRUST BORROWED FUNDS FROM A

U.S. UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF THE PREFERRED SHARES, AND THE COMPANY GUARANTEED THE SOP DEBT.

THE SOP TRUST MAY AT ANY TIME CONVERT ANY OR ALL OF THE PREFERRED SHARES INTO SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT A RATE OF EIGHT SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK FOR EACH PREFERRED SHARE. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS RESERVED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO SATISFY THE CONVERSION OF ALL PREFERRED SHARES ISSUED TO THE SOP TRUST AND THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES TO MEET

EMPLOYEE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. UPON THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES, THE COMPANY WILL ISSUE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO THE TRUST TO FULFILL THE REDEMPTION OBLIGATIONS. SEE NOTE 14.

HOLDERS OF PREFERRED STOCK HAVE A PREFERENCE UPON LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP OF THE COMPANY OF $100 PER SHARE.

COMMON STOCK

ON APRIL 1, 2004, EACH ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARE OF TPC CLASS A AND CLASS

B COMMON STOCK (INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS) WAS EXCHANGED FOR 0.4334 OF A SHARE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. SEE NOTE 2.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY, CONTINUED

THE COMPANY IS GOVERNED BY THE MINNESOTA BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT. ALL AUTHORIZED SHARES OF VOTING

COMMON STOCK HAVE NO PAR VALUE. SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REACQUIRED ARE CONSIDERED TREASURY SHARES. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF THE COMPANY IS 1.75 BILLION.

THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ISSUE FIVE MILLION UNDESIGNATED SHARES. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY

DESIGNATE THE TYPE OF SHARES AND SET THE TERMS THEREOF. THE BOARD DESIGNATED 1,450,000 SHARES AS SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORMATION OF THE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN.

ON JANUARY 25, 2005, THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROGRAM

(CAP) AND ON JANUARY 25, 2005 AND FEBRUARY 4, 2005, THROUGH ITS EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM, ISSUED 2,048,729 COMMON STOCK AWARDS IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND DEFERRED STOCK TO PARTICIPATING OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. THE FAIR VALUE PER

SHARE OF THE COMMON STOCK WAS $36.97 AND $38.16 ON JANUARY 25, 2005 AND FEBRUARY 4, 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AWARDS GENERALLY VEST AFTER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD FOR THE 2005 CAP AWARDS AND THREE YEARS FOR THE 2005 AWARDS ISSUED UNDER THE EQUITY AWARDS

PROGRAM. ON JANUARY 22, 2004 AND JANUARY 23, 2003, THE COMPANY ISSUED UNDER THE CAP PROGRAM 847,593 AND 842,368 SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, OF COMMON STOCK IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK TO PARTICIPATING OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. THE FAIR VALUE

ON MARCH 21, 2002, TPC SOLD APPROXIMATELY 231 MILLION SHARES OF ITS CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN A PUBLIC OFFERING FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $4.09 BILLION.

TREASURY STOCK

ALL SHARES OF TPC COMMON STOCK THAT WERE HELD BY THE COMPANY AS TREASURY

STOCK AT THE MERGER DATE OF APRIL 1, 2004, WERE CANCELLED AND RETIRED AS OF THAT DATE.

THE COMPANYS 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE SPC 1994 STOCK INCENTIVES PLAN AND THE TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN PROVIDE SETTLEMENT ALTERNATIVES TO EMPLOYEES IN WHICH THE COMPANY REPURCHASES SHARES TO COVER TAX WITHHOLDING

COSTS AND EXERCISE COSTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY HAD PURCHASED $14 MILLION AND $18 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PLAN.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER, TPCS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A $500 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. DURING 2003, TPC

REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION SHARES (AS ADJUSTED FOR THE MERGER) OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $40 MILLION. THAT REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS TERMINATED UPON COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A COMMITMENT, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AUGUST 2002

CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION, TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY COMMON STOCK HELD BY THE CITIGROUP CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROGRAM (CITIGROUP CAP) UPON FORFEITURE OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS FOR WHICH IT PREPAID $15 MILLION. THIS COMMITMENT EXPIRES OVER THREE YEARS UPON

VESTING OF THE CITIGROUP CAP PARTICIPANTS. IN MARCH 2004, CITIGROUP ACCELERATED THE VESTING OF THEIR CAP PARTICIPANT AWARDS, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY HAS NO FURTHER OBLIGATION TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY STOCK HELD BY CITIGROUP CAP. THE COMPANY HAS

63,321 SHARES DUE FROM CITIGROUP FOR UNVESTED SHARES AND A PREPAID BALANCE DUE FROM CITIGROUP OF $7 MILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, TPC HAD ACQUIRED $4 MILLION AND $1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ITS COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THIS ARRANGEMENT.

COMMON SHARES ACQUIRED UNDER THESE PLANS ARE REPORTED AS

TREASURY STOCK IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. A MAXIMUM OF $2.61 BILLION IS AVAILABLE IN 2005 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS WITHOUT PRIOR

13. INCENTIVE PLANS

AFTER THE MERGER, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2004 INCENTIVE

PLAN), WHICH ALSO WAS APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS ON JULY 28, 2004. THE PURPOSES OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN ARE TO REWARD THE EFFORTS OF THE COMPANYS NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES AND TO ATTRACT

NEW PERSONNEL BY PROVIDING INCENTIVES IN THE FORM OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN PERMITS GRANTS OF NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK, STOCK UNITS,

PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED OR STOCK-DENOMINATED AWARDS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED PURSUANT TO AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE 2004

INCENTIVE PLAN IS 35 MILLION SHARES, SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE LEGACY

TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. 2002 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

(LEGACY TPC 2002

INCENTIVE PLAN) AND THE LEGACY

ST. PAUL GLOBAL STOCK OPTION PLAN

(LEGACY GLOBAL STOCK OPTION PLAN), WHICH CEASED GRANTING AWARDS AFTER 2001, WERE TERMINATED. THE LEGACY

ST. PAUL AMENDED AND RESTATED 1994 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

(LEGACY

SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN) HAD EXPIRED ON MAY 4, 2004 BY ITS OWN TERMS, AND OTHER LEGACY SPC STOCK PLANS HAD EITHER TERMINATED OR HAD NO SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANT. THE LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN WAS THE ONLY PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH TPC COULD

MAKE STOCK-BASED AWARDS PRIOR TO THE MERGER. OUTSTANDING GRANTS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE PLANS TERMINATION INCLUDING THE GRANT OF RELOAD OPTIONS RELATED TO PRIOR OPTION GRANTS UNDER THE LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN AND THE LEGACY SPC 1994

STOCK PLAN.

THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN IS THE ONLY PLAN PURSUANT

TO WHICH FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED. IN ADDITION TO THE 35 MILLION SHARES INITIALLY AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE COUNTED TOWARDS THE 35 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE

FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN: (I) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO AN AWARD THAT EXPIRES UNEXERCISED, THAT IS FORFEITED, TERMINATED OR CANCELED, THAT IS SETTLED IN CASH OR OTHER FORMS OF PROPERTY, OR OTHERWISE DOES NOT RESULT IN

THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, IN WHOLE OR IN PART; (II) SHARES THAT ARE USED TO PAY THE EXERCISE PRICE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SHARES USED TO PAY WITHHOLDING TAXES ON AWARDS GENERALLY; AND (III) SHARES PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ON THE OPEN

MARKET USING CASH OPTION EXERCISE PROCEEDS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR GRANT PURSUANT TO SUCH MARKET PURCHASES SHALL NOT BE GREATER THAN THE NUMBER THAT COULD BE REPURCHASED AT FAIR

MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF EXERCISE OF THE STOCK OPTION GIVING RISE TO SUCH OPTION PROCEEDS.

EXCEPT FOR SHARES DELIVERED TO OR RETAINED IN THE SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN AND THE TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE PAYMENT OF THE EXERCISE PRICE OF AND, AS TO TPC OPTION GRANTS, THE WITHHOLDING OF TAXES

APPLICABLE TO THE EXERCISE OF, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS UNDER THOSE PLANS THAT HAVE RELOAD FEATURES, THE PROVISIONS OF THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH THAT RESULT IN SHARES BECOMING AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN ALSO APPLY TO ANY

AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE SPC1994 STOCK PLAN AND THE TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN THAT WERE OUTSTANDING ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 2004 STOCK PLAN. IN ADDITION, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2004 STOCK PLAN WILL NOT

BE REDUCED BY SHARES SUBJECT TO AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN UPON THE ASSUMPTION OF OR IN SUBSTITUTION FOR AWARDS IN CONNECTION WITH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (AS DEFINED IN THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN).

AFTER THE MERGER, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALSO ADOPTED A

COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS (THE 2004 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM). UNDER THE 2004 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS COMPENSATION CONSISTS OF AN ANNUAL RETAINER, A DEFERRED STOCK AWARD AND A STOCK

OPTION AWARD. EACH NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR MAY CHOOSE TO RECEIVE ALL OR A PORTION OF HIS OR HER ANNUAL

RETAINER AND ANY COMMITTEE CHAIR OR CO-CHAIR FEES PAID IN THE FORM OF CASH, COMMON STOCK OR DEFERRED STOCK. DEFERRED STOCK FOR THE ANNUAL RETAINER, AND

COMMITTEE CHAIR AND CO-CHAIR FEES, IS ELECTED PURSUANT TO THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS THAT THE BOARD ADOPTED AFTER THE MERGER AND IS VESTED UPON GRANT. THE ANNUAL DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS VEST ONE YEAR

AFTER THE DATE OF AWARD. ANY OF THE DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS MAY ACCUMULATE UNTIL DISTRIBUTION AT A FUTURE DATE OR UPON TERMINATION OF A DIRECTORS SERVICE. THE SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ISSUED UNDER THE 2004 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

PROGRAM, INCLUDING SHARES OF DEFERRED STOCK, ARE AWARDED UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN.

FIXED STOCK OPTION AWARDS

2004 INCENTIVE

PLAN

THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED AN EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM

UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE STOCK OPTION AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM, STOCK OPTION AWARDS ARE GRANTED HAVING A TEN-YEAR TERM WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL

TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. GENERALLY, THE STOCK OPTIONS VEST OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD, WITH 50% OF THE OPTION SHARES VESTING ON THE 2

ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF GRANT, AND 25% OF THE OPTION SHARES VESTING ON EACH OF THE 3

RD

AND 4

TH

ANNIVERSARIES OF

THE GRANT DATE. EXCEPT AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD MAY ALLOW IN THE FUTURE, STOCK OPTIONS CANNOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY THE PARTICIPANT.

LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN

ON APRIL 1, 2004, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF TPC COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO

OPTIONS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THESE STOCK OPTIONS RETAINED SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WERE APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE CONVERSION. THE 0.4334 MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO WAS APPLIED TO THE OUTSTANDING TPC STOCK

OPTIONS TO REFLECT THIS CONVERSION.

THE TPC STOCK OPTIONS

AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN HAVE A TEN-YEAR TERM WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT (AS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE MERGER). STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THIS

PLAN PRIOR TO APRIL 27, 2004, GENERALLY VEST 20% EACH YEAR OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN FROM APRIL 27, 2004 UNTIL THE PLAN TERMINATION ON JULY 28, 2004, GENERALLY VEST OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD, WITH 50% OF THE OPTION

SHARES VESTING ON THE 2

ND

ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF GRANT, AND 25% OF THE OPTION SHARES VESTING ON EACH OF THE

3

RD

AND 4

TH

ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE. PRIOR TO JANUARY 23, 2003, CERTAIN STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN PERMITTED AN EMPLOYEE EXERCISING AN OPTION TO BE GRANTED A NEW OPTION

(A RELOAD OPTION) IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE TPC COMMON STOCK USED TO SATISFY BOTH THE EXERCISE PRICE AND WITHHOLDING TAXES DUE UPON EXERCISE OF AN OPTION. PRIOR TO THE MERGER, THE RELOAD OPTIONS WERE GRANTED AT AN EXERCISE

PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF TPCS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT, AND AFTER THE MERGER THE RELOAD OPTIONS WILL BE GRANTED AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF

GRANT. THE RELOAD OPTIONS VEST SIX MONTHS AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED ORIGINAL OPTION.

ALSO UNDER THE TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN, TPC HAD ESTABLISHED A WEALTHBUILDER STOCK OPTION PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE GRANTING OF STOCK OPTIONS TO ALL

EMPLOYEES MEETING CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, HAVING THE SAME TERMS AS THE MANAGEMENT GRANTS DESCRIBED ABOVE EXCEPT THAT THE AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THIS PROGRAM DID NOT CONTAIN STOCK OPTION RELOAD FEATURES. TPC CEASED ISSUING STOCK-OPTION AWARDS UNDER THE

WEALTHBUILDER STOCK OPTION PROGRAM AFTER JUNE 2002.

INCENTIVE PLANS, CONTINUED

LEGACY SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN AND GLOBAL STOCK OPTION PLAN

ON APRIL 1, 2004, IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, THE COMPANY ASSUMED 23

MILLION OUTSTANDING SPC STOCK OPTIONS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 4 MILLION REMAINED UNVESTED RELATED TO LEGACY SPC EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THESE STOCK OPTIONS RETAINED THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WERE APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE MERGER.

UNDER THE SPC STOCK OPTION PROGRAMS, STOCK OPTION AWARDS WERE GRANTED HAVING A TEN YEAR TERM WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. GENERALLY, OPTIONS VEST 25% EACH YEAR OVER A

FOUR-YEAR PERIOD. CERTAIN STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2002 AND FEBRUARY 3, 2003 PERMITTED AN EMPLOYEE EXERCISING AN OPTION TO BE GRANTED A NEW OPTION (A RELOAD OPTION) IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER

OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY COMMON STOCK USED TO SATISFY THE EXERCISE PRICE DUE UPON EXERCISE OF AN OPTION. THE RELOAD OPTIONS ARE GRANTED AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT, VEST ONE

YEAR AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED ORIGINAL OPTION.

LEGACY CITIGROUP INCENTIVE PLANS

PRIOR TO THE IPO IN MARCH 2002, TPC PARTICIPATED IN VARIOUS STOCK OPTION PLANS SPONSORED BY ITS FORMER AFFILIATE, CITIGROUP, THAT PROVIDED FOR THE

GRANTING OF STOCK OPTIONS IN CITIGROUP COMMON STOCK TO OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES, AND, IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN STOCK OPTION PROGRAMS, TO ALL EMPLOYEES MEETING SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.

ON AUGUST 20, 2002, IN CONNECTION WITH THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION, CITIGROUP STOCK OPTION AWARDS HELD BY TPC EMPLOYEES ON

THAT DATE UNDER VARIOUS LEGACY CITIGROUP INCENTIVE PLANS WERE CANCELLED AND REPLACED WITH STOCK OPTION AWARDS (REPLACEMENT AWARDS) TO PURCHASE TPCS COMMON STOCK UNDER THE TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN. THESE REPLACEMENT AWARDS WERE GRANTED ON

SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, INCLUDING VESTING, AS THE FORMER CITIGROUP AWARDS. REFLECTING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE MERGER, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THE REPLACEMENT AWARDS WAS 25 MILLION SHARES OF WHICH 11 MILLION

SHARES WERE VESTED AND THEREFORE EXERCISABLE. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF TPCS COMMON STOCK TO WHICH THE REPLACEMENT AWARDS RELATED AND THE PER SHARE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE REPLACEMENT AWARDS WERE DETERMINED SO THAT.



THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF EACH CITIGROUP OPTION, WHICH WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CLOSING PRICE OF CITIGROUPS COMMON STOCK ON AUGUST 20, 2002, AND THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE

CITIGROUP OPTIONS, WAS PRESERVED IN EACH REPLACEMENT AWARD FOR TPCS COMMON STOCK; AND



THE RATIO OF THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE REPLACEMENT AWARD TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON AUGUST 20, 2002, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION,

WAS THE SAME AS THE RATIO OF THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE CITIGROUP OPTION TO THE PRICE OF CITIGROUP COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION.

INCENTIVE PLANS, CONTINUED

IN CONNECTION WITH SPC OPTIONS ASSUMED IN THE MERGER, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ALL THE OUTSTANDING

SPC STOCK OPTIONS AT APRIL 1, 2004 WAS $186 MILLION AND WAS INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE BASED UPON THE ANNOUNCEMENT DATE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF SPC COMMON STOCK, USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL. THE UNVESTED STOCK OPTION

AWARDS REQUIRE THE HOLDER TO RENDER SERVICE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD AND ARE THEREFORE CONSIDERED UNEARNED COMPENSATION. AT APRIL 1, 2004, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE UNVESTED AWARDS WERE $35 MILLION AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN UNEARNED

COMPENSATION AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF EQUITY. THE UNEARNED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS BEING RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO INCOME OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION, THE EXCHANGE OF OPTIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A SPINOFF IS CONSIDERED A MODIFICATION AND THEREFORE THE

MODIFICATION GUIDANCE OF FAS 123 WAS APPLIED TO THE REPLACEMENT AWARDS ISSUED ON AUGUST 20, 2002. FOR VESTED REPLACEMENT OPTIONS, ANY EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MODIFIED OPTIONS ISSUED OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL OPTIONS AT THE DATE OF

EXCHANGE WAS RECOGNIZED AS ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION COST. FOR NONVESTED REPLACEMENT OPTIONS, ANY EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MODIFIED OPTIONS ISSUED OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL OPTIONS AT THE DATE OF EXCHANGE IS ADDED TO THE REMAINING

UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST OF THE ORIGINAL OPTION AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD.

ALSO, CIRI HAD EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS IN WHICH AWARDS WERE GRANTED IN CIRIS PRIVATELY HELD COMMON STOCK. IN CONNECTION WITH

INDEMNITYS PURCHASE OF THE MINORITY INTEREST OF CIRI (SEE NOTE 2) THE COMPANY CONVERTED CIRIS OUTSTANDING EQUITY BASED-AWARDS INTO AWARDS IN THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THE CONVERTED AWARDS RETAINED THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS

THAT WERE APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE CONVERSION. THE CONVERSION OF CIRI OUTSTANDING NONVESTED OPTIONS INTO OPTIONS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK IS CONSIDERED A MODIFICATION AND THEREFORE THE MODIFICATION GUIDANCE OF FAS 123 WAS APPLIED

TO THE CONVERTED AWARDS. FOR THESE CONVERTED OPTIONS, THE EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MODIFIED OPTIONS ISSUED OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL OPTIONS AT THE DATE OF EXCHANGE IS ADDED TO THE REMAINING UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST OF THE

ORIGINAL OPTION AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD.

UNDER FAS 123, RELOAD OPTIONS ARE TREATED AS SEPARATE GRANTS FROM THE ORIGINAL GRANTS AND AS A RESULT ARE SEPARATELY VALUED WHEN GRANTED. RELOAD OPTIONS ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED ORIGINAL OPTION AND THEREFORE

WOULD GENERALLY HAVE A SHORTER ESTIMATED LIFE. SHARES RECEIVED THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES UNDER THE RELOAD PROGRAM ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION ON SALE. DISCOUNTS (AS MEASURED BY THE ESTIMATED COST OF PROTECTION) HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF

RELOAD OPTIONS GRANTED TO REFLECT THESE SALES RESTRICTIONS.

DEFERRED STOCK TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN. SUCH AWARDS INCLUDE RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS UNDER THE CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROGRAM (CAP) AND EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE

PLAN. AWARDS ISSUED UNDER THE CAP PROGRAM ARE IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES INCLUDED IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD IS CALCULATED AT A 10% DISCOUNT FROM THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF THE AWARD AND GENERALLY VEST IN FULL

AFTER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. OTHER RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS ISSUED UNDER THE EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM GENERALLY VEST IN FULL AFTER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. EXCEPT UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, DURING THIS PERIOD THE

STOCK CANNOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY THE PARTICIPANT, WHO IS REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE TO THE COMPANY DURING THE RESTRICTED PERIOD. AWARDS GRANTED TO NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS ARE IN THE FORM OF DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS. THESE DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS ARE

LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLANS

ON APRIL 1, 2004, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS OF THE

LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN WERE CONVERTED TO RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS IN THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS RETAINED SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT

WERE APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE CONVERSION. THE 0.4334 MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO WAS APPLIED TO THE OUTSTANDING TPC RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS TO REFLECT THIS CONVERSION.

THE TPC RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE LEGACY TPC 2002 INCENTIVE PLAN WERE AWARDED TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY

EMPLOYEES THROUGH TPCS CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROGRAM (TPC CAP). UNDER THIS PLAN, CERTAIN TPC CAP PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED PART OF THEIR ANNUAL BONUS AWARDS IN RESTRICTED STOCK, AND AT THEIR ELECTION, PART IN STOCK OPTIONS. THE NUMBER OF SHARES

INCLUDED IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD WAS CALCULATED AT A 25% DISCOUNT FROM THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF THE AWARD AND GENERALLY VESTED IN FULL AFTER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. EXCEPT UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, DURING THIS PERIOD THE STOCK CANNOT BE

SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY THE PARTICIPANT, WHO IS REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE TO THE COMPANY DURING THE RESTRICTED PERIOD. AWARDS GRANTED TO NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS WERE IN THE FORM OF DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS. THESE DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE

SAME CONDITIONS AS THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS EXCEPT THAT THE SHARES ARE NOT ISSUED UNTIL THE VESTING CRITERIA ARE SATISFIED.

LEGACY SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN

ON APRIL 1, 2004, IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, THE COMPANY ASSUMED APPROXIMATELY 240,000 OF OUTSTANDING SPC RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS RELATED TO SPC

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS RETAINED THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WERE APPLICABLE PRIOR TO THE MERGER. UNDER THE SPC 1994 STOCK PLAN, THE AWARDS OF RESTRICTED STOCK WERE SUBJECT TO COMPLETING A SPECIFIED

OBJECTIVE OR PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT, GENERALLY ONE TO FIVE YEARS. UNDER THE SPC CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PLAN, IMPLEMENTED IN 2002, THE NUMBER OF SHARES INCLUDED IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD IS CALCULATED AT A 10% DISCOUNT FROM THE MARKET PRICE AT THE

DATE OF THE AWARD AND GENERALLY VESTS IN FULL AFTER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD. THE UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS REQUIRE THE HOLDER TO RENDER SERVICE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD AND ARE THEREFORE CONSIDERED UNEARNED COMPENSATION. AT APRIL 1, 2004, THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION WAS $9 MILLION AND HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN UNEARNED COMPENSATION AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF EQUITY. THE UNEARNED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS BEING RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE

TO INCOME OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD.

LEGACY

CITIGROUP INCENTIVE PLAN

PRIOR TO THE IPO, TPC

PARTICIPATED IN CITIGROUPS CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PLAN (CITIGROUP CAP) THAT PROVIDED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF CITIGROUP COMMON STOCK IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES WITH SUBSTANTIALLY THE

SAME TERMS AS THE TPCS 2002 CAP.

ON AUGUST 20, 2002, IN

CONNECTION WITH THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION, THE UNVESTED OUTSTANDING AWARDS OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND DEFERRED SHARES HELD BY TPC EMPLOYEES ON THAT DATE UNDER CITIGROUP CAP, WERE CANCELLED AND REPLACED BY AWARDS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF 1.3 MILLION

NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF TPCS COMMON STOCK (WHICH REFLECTS ADJUSTMENT FOR THE MERGER) AT A TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF $53 MILLION BASED ON THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE TPCS COMMON STOCK ON AUGUST 20, 2002. THESE REPLACEMENT AWARDS WERE GRANTED ON

SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, INCLUDING VESTING, AS THE FORMER CITIGROUP AWARDS. THE VALUE OF THESE NEWLY ISSUED SHARES ALONG WITH THE

DIRECTORS SERVICE. THE AFTER-TAX COMPENSATION COST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PLAN WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002.

UNEARNED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO INCOME RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE AFTER-TAX COMPENSATION COST CHARGED TO EARNINGS FOR

THESE RESTRICTED STOCK AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS WAS $26 MILLION, $17 MILLION AND $17 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER INCENTIVE PLANS

IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANYS EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS DISCUSSED ABOVE, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS HAS AN EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN IN WHICH

AWARDS ARE GRANTED IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK. THE AFTER-TAX COMPENSATION COST ASSOCIATED WITH THESE AWARDS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS EARNINGS WAS APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION.

SATISFYING CERTAIN AGE AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS REMAIN COVERED BY A PRIOR FINAL PAY FORMULAS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY AND TPC SPONSOR NONQUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS WHICH COVER CERTAIN HIGHLY-COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES AND ALSO SPONSOR

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLANS FOR EMPLOYEES SATISFYING CERTAIN AGE AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND FOR CERTAIN RETIREES. PRIOR TO THE AUGUST 20, 2002 CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION, SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR BENEFITS WERE PROVIDED TO TPC

EMPLOYEES THROUGH PLANS SPONSORED BY CITIGROUP.

IN CHOOSING THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL RETURNS OF EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME MARKETS IN CONJUNCTION WITH TODAYS ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

AS AN INDICATOR OF SENSITIVITY, INCREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND

RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $39 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. DECREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 BY $32 MILLION AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST

COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FOREGOING HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES TO THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS NEGLIGIBLE.

ON DECEMBER 8, 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (2003 MEDICARE ACT) WAS

ENACTED. THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT INTRODUCES A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE PART D AS WELL AS A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART

D. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS AVAILABLE UNDER THE SPC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ARE ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART D AND THUS QUALIFY FOR THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY UNDER THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT. THE COMPANY ALSO

EXPECTS THAT THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY WILL OFFSET OR REDUCE THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE COST OF THE UNDERLYING POSTRETIREMENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE ON WHICH THE SUBSIDY IS BASED. AS A RESULT, THE ESTIMATED EFFECT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT WAS

REFLECTED IN THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING REMEASUREMENT OF THE SPC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ON APRIL 1, 2004. THE EFFECT OF THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS A $29 MILLION REDUCTION (WITH NO TAX EFFECT) IN THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS OF

401(K) SAVINGS PLAN

THE COMPANY HAS A 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN UNDER WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

LEGACY TPC EMPLOYEES AND COMPANY EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER APRIL 1, 2004, ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN 2004, THE COMPANY MATCHED EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 5% OF ELIGIBLE PAY BUT NOT MORE THAN $2,500 ANNUALLY. PRIOR TO 2004, THE COMPANY MATCHED

EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 3% OF ELIGIBLE PAY BUT NOT MORE THAN $1,500 ANNUALLY. THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THIS PLAN WAS $34 MILLION, $20 MILLION AND $17 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

SAVINGS PLUS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, THE COMPANY ASSUMED THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES,

INC. SAVINGS PLUS PLAN (SPP), A 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN AND THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP). SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES WHO WERE HIRED BY LEGACY SPC BEFORE APRIL 1, 2004 ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PLANS. IN 2004 UNDER

THE SPP, THE COMPANY MATCHED 100% OF EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 6% OF THEIR SALARY. THE MATCH WAS IN THE FORM OF PREFERRED SHARES, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE IN THE SOP, OR IN THE COMPANYS COMMON SHARES. ALSO ALLOCATED TO

PARTICIPANTS WERE PREFERRED SHARES EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF DIVIDENDS ON PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED SHARES.

TO FINANCE THE PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE FOR FUTURE ALLOCATION TO QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, THE SOP

BORROWED $150 MILLION AT 9.4% FROM A PRIMARY U.S. UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY. AS THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OF THE TRUSTS LOAN IS PAID, A PRO RATA AMOUNT OF PREFERRED STOCK IS RELEASED FOR ALLOCATION TO PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES. EACH SHARE OF

PREFERRED STOCK PAYS A DIVIDEND OF $11.72 ANNUALLY AND IS CURRENTLY CONVERTIBLE INTO EIGHT SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS ON ALL SHARES HELD BY THE TRUST ARE USED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE SOP OBLIGATION. IN ADDITION TO

DIVIDENDS PAID TO THE TRUST, ADDITIONAL CASH CONTRIBUTIONS ARE MADE TO THE SOP AS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET THE SOPS DEBT OBLIGATION.

ALL COMMON SHARES AND THE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENT OF ALL PREFERRED SHARES HELD BY THE SOP ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR DILUTED EPS COMPUTATIONS AND

DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALL SHARES ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF POSITION 76-3, ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS IN ACCOUNTING FOR THIS PLAN. THE COMPANY RECORDED AN EXPENSE OF $5

MILLION IN 2004.

RENT EXPENSE WAS $214 MILLION, $115 MILLION AND $123 MILLION IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. RENT EXPENSE RELATED TO CERTAIN LEASES IN 2002 WAS

SHARED BY TPC AND A FORMER AFFILIATE ON A COST ALLOCATION METHOD BASED GENERALLY ON ESTIMATED USAGE BY DEPARTMENT. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CITIGROUP DISTRIBUTION, TPC PURCHASED CERTAIN PROPERTIES FROM CITIGROUP.

FUTURE MINIMUM ANNUAL RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER NONCANCELLABLE OPERATING LEASES

ARE $171 MILLION, $149 MILLION, $127 MILLION, $100 MILLION, $68 MILLION AND $124 MILLION FOR 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 AND 2010 AND THEREAFTER, RESPECTIVELY. FUTURE SUBLEASE RENTAL INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $69 MILLION WILL PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY MAY USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EQUITY SWAPS, CREDIT DERIVATIVES, OPTIONS, FINANCIAL FUTURES AND

FORWARD CONTRACTS, AS A MEANS OF HEDGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE, EQUITY PRICE CHANGE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. THE COMPANYS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CONTINUED

TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE, THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS DESIGNATED AND FORMALLY DOCUMENTED AT INCEPTION

DETAILING THE PARTICULAR RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR THE HEDGE, WHICH INCLUDES THE ITEM AND RISK THAT IS BEING HEDGED, THE DERIVATIVE THAT IS BEING USED, AS WELL AS HOW EFFECTIVENESS IS BEING ASSESSED. A DERIVATIVE HAS TO BE HIGHLY

EFFECTIVE IN ACCOMPLISHING THE OBJECTIVE OF OFFSETTING EITHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED.

FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES), TOGETHER WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE RELATED HEDGED ITEM. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE AMOUNT THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCLUDE IN EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY DID NOT UTILIZE FAIR VALUE HEDGES DURING THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE COMPANYS FAIR VALUE HEDGES RESULT FROM NUVEEN INVESTMENTS UTILIZATION OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE A PORTION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS PRIVATE PLACEMENT DEBT. THE SWAPS WERE TERMINATED IN 2004.

FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT DEPENDS ON THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGE. TO THE EXTENT THESE DERIVATIVES ARE EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING THE VARIABILITY OF THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS, CHANGES IN THE DERIVATIVES FAIR VALUE WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN CURRENT EARNINGS BUT ARE REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED

OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES. THESE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS OF FUTURE PERIODS WHEN EARNINGS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE AMOUNT THAT THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCLUDE IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS FOR THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. TO THE EXTENT THESE DERIVATIVES ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE IMMEDIATELY INCLUDED

IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE COMPANYS CASH FLOW HEDGES PRIMARILY INCLUDE HEDGES OF FLOATING RATE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS UP TO A MAXIMUM TENURE OF ONE YEAR.

FOR NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IN WHICH DERIVATIVES HEDGE THE FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURE OF A NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT WILL SIMILARLY DEPEND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGE. THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE HEDGING THE NET INVESTMENT, INCLUDING ANY

FORWARD PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT, IS REFLECTED IN THE ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES AS PART OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE AMOUNT INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES WAS A $4 MILLION LOSS AND A $17 MILLION LOSS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION IS REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS IS EVALUATED ON A

RETROSPECTIVE AND PROSPECTIVE BASIS USING QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF CORRELATION. IF A HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS FOUND TO BE INEFFECTIVE, IT NO LONGER QUALIFIES AS A HEDGE, AND ANY EXCESS GAINS OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH INEFFECTIVENESS AS WELL AS

SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY HAD NO REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES FROM HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS.

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED OR DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES ARE ALSO

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN VALUE REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004

ARE ULTIMATELY REFLECTED AS AN ELEMENT OF THE YIELD. FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES, ANY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE END-USER DERIVATIVE REMAIN IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES, AND ARE INCLUDED IN EARNINGS OF FUTURE PERIODS WHEN EARNINGS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF THE HEDGED CASH FLOW. IF THE HEDGED RELATIONSHIP WAS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT

OCCUR WHEN SCHEDULED, ANY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE END-USER DERIVATIVE ARE IMMEDIATELY REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY HAD NO DISCONTINUED FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS.

THE COMPANY ALSO PURCHASES INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE

EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES. THESE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN VALUE REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE COMPANY BIFURCATES AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE WHERE A) THE

ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF THE EMBEDDED INSTRUMENT ARE NOT CLEARLY AND CLOSELY RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF THE HOST CONTRACT, B) THE ENTIRE INSTRUMENT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE REMEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, AND C) A

SEPARATE INSTRUMENT WITH THE SAME TERMS OF THE EMBEDDED INSTRUMENT WOULD MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE UNDER FAS 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

(FAS 133). DERIVATIVES EMBEDDED IN CONVERTIBLE DEBT

SECURITIES ARE REPORTED ON A COMBINED BASIS WITH THEIR HOST INSTRUMENT AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY ENGAGED IN U.S. TREASURY NOTE FUTURES TRANSACTIONS TO MODIFY THE DURATION OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO 90 DAY FUTURES

CONTRACTS ON 2 YEAR, 5 YEAR, 10 YEAR AND 30 YEAR U.S. TREASURY NOTES WHICH REQUIRE A DAILY MARK TO MARKET SETTLEMENT WITH THE BROKER. THE NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE OPEN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS WAS $1.33 BILLION AND $1.48 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2004 AND DECEMBER 31, 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AND DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES UNDER FAS 133 AND AS SUCH THE DAILY MARK TO MARKET SETTLEMENT IS REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). NET REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) IN 2004 AND 2003 INCLUDED LOSSES OF $44 MILLION AND $27 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS WHICH ARE SETTLED DAILY.

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 6 MILLION STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS OF PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS, A PUBLICLY HELD

COMPANY. THESE WARRANTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AND DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES UNDER FAS 133 AND AS SUCH THE MARK TO MARKET IS REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES).

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ENTERED INTO SWAP AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE SWAP AGREEMENTS

ARE USED TO SUPPORT NEW PRODUCTS OFFERED BY NUVEEN INVESTMENTS. THE MARK-TO-MARKET VALUATIONS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AND ARE REFLECTED IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY TERMINATED ITS INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER. THE NOTIONAL VALUE OF

THESE SWAPS WAS $730 MILLION AT THE TIME OF THE TERMINATION. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WERE USED TO MANAGE EXPOSURE OF CERTAIN OF ITS FIXED RATE DEBT TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DID NOT QUALIFY FOR CONTINUED

HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOLLOWING THE MERGER AND, AS SUCH, THE MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WERE REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES PRIOR TO THE TERMINATION OF THESE AGREEMENTS.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS

BUSINESS. CERTAIN INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE EXCLUDED BY FAS 107,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

, AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNTS DISCUSSED.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CONTINUED

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITIES HAD A FAIR VALUE, WHICH EQUALED

CARRYING VALUE, OF $54.26 BILLION AND $33.05 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITIES FOR WHICH A QUOTED MARKET PRICE OR DEALER QUOTE ARE NOT AVAILABLE WAS $574 MILLION AND $685 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND

2003, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 1.

THE CARRYING VALUES OF CASH,

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, MORTGAGE LOANS, INVESTMENT INCOME ACCRUED, AND PAYABLES FOR SECURITIES LENDING AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS APPROXIMATED THEIR FAIR VALUES. SEE NOTES 1 AND 6.

THE CARRYING VALUES OF $1.23 BILLION AND $284 MILLION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS APPROXIMATED THEIR

FAIR VALUES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE CARRYING VALUES OF $4.94 BILLION AND $2.69 BILLION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, ALSO APPROXIMATED THEIR FAIR

VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING VARIOUS METHODS INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AS APPROPRIATE FOR THE VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 WAS $6.62 BILLION AND $6.78 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESPECTIVE TOTALS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WERE $2.68 BILLION AND $2.77 BILLION.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER INCLUDED IN DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 APPROXIMATED ITS BOOK VALUE OF $499 MILLION BECAUSE OF ITS SHORT-TERM NATURE. FOR OTHER DEBT, THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE WAS BASED UPON THE BID PRICE AT DECEMBER 31, 2004

AND 2003.

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

CONTINGENCIES

THE FOLLOWING SECTION DESCRIBES THE MAJOR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS, TO WHICH THE

COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE A PARTY OR TO WHICH ANY OF THE COMPANYS PROPERTY IS SUBJECT.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED PROCEEDINGS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY RECEIVES CLAIMS FOR INSURANCE ARISING UNDER POLICIES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY ASSERTING ALLEGED INJURIES AND DAMAGES FROM ASBESTOS AND OTHER HAZARDOUS WASTE

AND TOXIC SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LITIGATION DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED LITIGATION. THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE RELATED LITIGATION CONTINUE TO CHANGE.

TPC IS INVOLVED IN THREE SIGNIFICANT PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO ACANDS, INC. (ACANDS), FORMERLY A NATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR AND INSTALLER OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS, INCLUDING ACANDS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. THE

PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE DISPUTES AS TO WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT ANY OF ACANDS POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR BODILY INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE COVERED BY INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. THESE PROCEEDINGS HAVE RESULTED IN DECISIONS FAVORABLE TO TPC,

ALTHOUGH THOSE DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO APPELLATE REVIEW. THE STATUS OF THE VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS IS DESCRIBED BELOW.

ACANDS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN SEPTEMBER 2002 (

IN RE: ACANDS, INC.,

PENDING IN THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE). IN ITS

PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION, ACANDS SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A TRUST TO PAY ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST IT AND SOUGHT TO ASSIGN TO THE TRUST ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE INSURANCE POLICIES

ISSUED BY TPC. THE PROPOSED PLAN AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FILED BY ACANDS CLAIMED THAT ACANDS HAD SETTLED THE VAST MAJORITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY

CLAIMS CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT FOR APPROXIMATELY $2.80 BILLION. ACANDS ASSERTS THAT, BASED ON A PRIOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN TPC AND ACANDS AND ACANDS INTERPRETATION OF THE JULY 31, 2003 ARBITRATION PANEL RULING DESCRIBED BELOW, TPC IS LIABLE

FOR 45% OF THE $2.80 BILLION. ON JANUARY 26, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ISSUED A DECISION REJECTING CONFIRMATION OF ACANDS PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. THE BANKRUPTCY COURT FOUND, CONSISTENT WITH TPCS OBJECTIONS TO ACANDS

PROPOSED PLAN, THAT THE PROPOSED PLAN WAS NOT FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR, WAS NOT PROPOSED IN GOOD FAITH AND DID NOT COMPLY WITH SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. ACANDS HAS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS DECISION AND HAS FILED

OBJECTIONS TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT. TPC HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE APPEAL AND OBJECTIONS AND HAS ALSO FILED AN OPPOSITION TO ACANDS OBJECTIONS.

AN ARBITRATION WAS COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2001 TO DETERMINE WHETHER AND TO WHAT

EXTENT ACANDS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR BODILY INJURY ASBESTOS CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INSURANCE POLICY AGGREGATE LIMITS. ON JULY 31, 2003, THE ARBITRATION PANEL RULED IN FAVOR OF TPC THAT ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST ACANDS ARE SUBJECT

TO THE AGGREGATE LIMITS OF THE POLICIES ISSUED TO ACANDS, WHICH HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED. IN OCTOBER 2003, ACANDS COMMENCED A LAWSUIT SEEKING TO VACATE THE ARBITRATION AWARD AS BEYOND THE PANELS SCOPE OF AUTHORITY (

ACANDS, INC. V. TRAVELERS

CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.,

U.S.D.CT., E.D. PA.). ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, THE COURT ENTERED AN ORDER DENYING ACANDS MOTION TO VACATE THE ARBITRATION AWARD. ON OCTOBER 6, 2004, ACANDS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL. BRIEFING OF THE APPEAL IS

COMPLETE. ORAL ARGUMENT HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED.

IN THE OTHER

PROCEEDING, A RELATED CASE PENDING BEFORE THE SAME COURT AND COMMENCED IN SEPTEMBER 2000 (

ACANDS V. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY CO.

, U.S.D. CT., E.D. PA.), ACANDS SOUGHT A DECLARATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS

AGAINST ACANDS ARE SUBJECT TO OCCURRENCE LIMITS UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC. TPC FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION BASED UPON THE JULY 31, 2003 ARBITRATION DECISION DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE COURT FOUND THE DISPUTE WAS MOOT AS A RESULT OF

THE ARBITRATION PANELS DECISION. THE COURT, THEREFORE, BASED ON THE ARBITRATION PANELS DECISION, DISMISSED THE CASE. ON OCTOBER 6, 2004, ACANDS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL. THIS APPEAL HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE APPEAL REFERENCED IN THE

PARAGRAPH ABOVE. BRIEFING OF THE APPEAL IS COMPLETE. ORAL ARGUMENT HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED.

WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE APPEALS OF THE VARIOUS ACANDS RULINGS OR OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS, BASED ON THESE RULINGS, THE COMPANY WOULD NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS REMAINING UNDER ANY

POLICIES ISSUED BY TPC TO ACANDS.

IN OCTOBER 2001 AND APRIL

2002, TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS (

WISE V. TRAVELERS

AND

MENINGER V. TRAVELERS

), WERE FILED AGAINST TPC AND OTHER INSURERS (NOT INCLUDING SPC) IN STATE COURT IN WEST VIRGINIA. THESE CASES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED INTO A

SINGLE PROCEEDING IN CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE INSURER DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BY INAPPROPRIATELY HANDLING AND SETTLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO REOPEN LARGE

NUMBERS OF SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, DIRECTLY ON INSURERS. LAWSUITS SIMILAR TO

WISE

WERE FILED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND HAWAII (THESE SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE

STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS). ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2001, PLAINTIFFS IN CONSOLIDATED ASBESTOS ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE A MASS TORT PANEL OF JUDGES IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT MOVED TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT TO NAME TPC AS A DEFENDANT,

ALLEGING THAT TPC AND OTHER INSURERS BREACHED ALLEGED DUTIES TO CERTAIN USERS OF ASBESTOS PRODUCTS. IN MARCH 2002, THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION TO AMEND. PLAINTIFFS SEEK DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF AND

RAISING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE PRESENTED IN THE WEST VIRGINIA AMENDED COMPLAINT ARE ALSO PENDING IN OHIO AND TEXAS STATE COURTS AGAINST TPC AND SPC AND IN LOUISIANA STATE COURT AGAINST TPC (THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THESE SUITS, TOGETHER WITH THE

WEST VIRGINIA SUIT, ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS).

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINUED

ALL OF THE ACTIONS AGAINST TPC DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, OTHER THAN THE HAWAII ACTIONS,

HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER ENTERED BY THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT IN NEW YORK THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY PRESIDED OVER AND APPROVED THE REORGANIZATION IN BANKRUPTCY OF TPCS FORMER POLICYHOLDER JOHNS-MANVILLE. IN AUGUST 2002,

THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CONDUCTED A HEARING ON TPCS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION PROHIBITING FURTHER PROSECUTION OF THE LAWSUITS PURSUANT TO THE REORGANIZATION PLAN AND RELATED ORDERS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS HEARING, THE COURT ORDERED

THE PARTIES TO MEDIATION, APPOINTED A MEDIATOR AND CONTINUED THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. DURING 2003, THE SAME BANKRUPTCY COURT EXTENDED THE EXISTING INJUNCTION TO APPLY TO AN ADDITIONAL SET OF CASES FILED IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS IN TEXAS AND

OHIO AS WELL AS TO THE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE PROSECUTING THESE CASES. THE ORDER ALSO ENJOINED THESE ATTORNEYS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE LAW FIRMS FROM COMMENCING ANY FURTHER LAWSUITS AGAINST TPC BASED UPON THESE ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE

COURT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE INJUNCTION, ADDITIONAL COMMON LAW CLAIMS WERE FILED AND SERVED ON TPC.

ON NOVEMBER 19, 2003, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT A SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS HAD BEEN REACHED. THIS SETTLEMENT

INCLUDES A LUMP SUM PAYMENT OF UP TO $412 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. AFTER CONTINUED MEETINGS WITH THE MEDIATOR, THE PARTIES ADVISED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON MAY 25, 2004 THAT A SETTLEMENT RESOLVING

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PENDING AND SIMILAR FUTURE COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC HAD ALSO BEEN REACHED. THIS SETTLEMENT REQUIRES A PAYMENT OF UP TO $90 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. EACH OF THESE SETTLEMENTS IS

CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ORDER OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CLARIFYING THAT ALL OF THESE CLAIMS, AND SIMILAR FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, ARE BARRED BY PRIOR ORDERS ENTERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ORIGINAL JOHNS-MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.

ON AUGUST 17,

2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED AN ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS AND CLARIFYING ITS PRIOR ORDERS THAT ALL OF THE PENDING STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON LAW CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST TPC ARE BARRED. THE ORDER ALSO APPLIES

TO SIMILAR DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

FIVE APPEALS WERE TAKEN FROM THE AUGUST 17, 2004 RULING. THESE APPEALS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED AND ARE CURRENTLY PENDING. THE PARTIES HAVE COMPLETED BRIEFING ALL OF THE ISSUES AND AWAIT A DATE FOR ORAL ARGUMENT. THE COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION

TO PAY ANY OF THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS UNLESS AND UNTIL THE ORDERS AND RELIEF BECOME FINAL AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY FURTHER APPELLATE REVIEW. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW APPELLATE COURTS WILL RULE ON THE PENDING APPEALS.

SPC, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT RULINGS OR THE SETTLEMENTS

DESCRIBED ABOVE, HAS NUMEROUS DEFENSES IN ALL OF THE DIRECT ACTION CASES ASSERTING COMMON LAW CLAIMS THAT ARE PENDING AGAINST IT. MANY OF THESE DEFENSES HAVE BEEN RAISED IN INITIAL MOTIONS TO DISMISS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS. THERE HAVE BEEN

FAVORABLE RULINGS DURING 2003 AND 2004 IN TEXAS AND DURING 2004 IN OHIO ON SOME OF THESE MOTIONS FILED BY SPC AND OTHER INSURERS THAT DEALT WITH STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND THE VALIDITY OF THE ALLEGED CAUSES OF ACTIONS. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE

ACTIONS HAVE APPEALED THESE FAVORABLE RULINGS. SPCS DEFENSES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THESE NOVEL THEORIES HAVE NO BASIS IN LAW; THAT THEY ARE DIRECTLY AT ODDS WITH THE WELL ESTABLISHED LAW PERTAINING TO THE INSURED/INSURER RELATIONSHIP; THAT

THERE IS NO GENERALIZED DUTY TO WARN AS ALLEGED BY THE PLAINTIFFS; AND THAT THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AS TO MANY OF THESE CLAIMS HAS LONG SINCE EXPIRED.

THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING ITS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS

DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF THESE DISPUTES IS UNCERTAIN. IN THIS REGARD, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE, INCLUDING SETTLING LITIGATION UNDER

APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT LEGAL OUTCOMES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. ANY SUCH DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY

FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS

ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION AND RELATED PROCEEDINGS

TPC AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WERE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THREE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY SHAREHOLDERS ALLEGING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC AND SEEKING

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS WELL AS UNSPECIFIED MONETARY DAMAGES. THE ACTIONS WERE CAPTIONED

FARINA

COMPLAINT ALSO NAMED SPC AND ITS FORMER SUBSIDIARY, ADAMS

ACQUISITION CORP., AS DEFENDANTS, ALLEGING THAT THEY AIDED AND ABETTED THE ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. ON MARCH 18, 2004, TPC AND SPC ANNOUNCED THAT ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS HAD BEEN SETTLED, SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENTS. THE

SETTLEMENT INCLUDED A MODIFICATION TO THE TERMINATION FEE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PAID HAD THE MERGER NOT BEEN COMPLETED, ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE IN THE PROXY STATEMENT DISTRIBUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER AND A NOMINAL AMOUNT FOR ATTORNEYS

FEES. BEFORE COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT, ADDITIONAL SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION WAS COMMENCED, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. IN LIGHT OF THAT LITIGATION, THE PARTIES ARE EVALUATING HOW TO PROCEED.

BEGINNING IN AUGUST 2004, FOLLOWING POST-MERGER ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY, VARIOUS SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY COMMENCED

FOURTEEN PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA. PLAINTIFF SHAREHOLDERS ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN DISCLOSURES

RELATING TO THE APRIL 2004 MERGER BETWEEN TPC AND SPC CONTAINED FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE VALUE OF SPCS LOSS RESERVES IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. THE COMPLAINTS DO NOT SPECIFY DAMAGES. THESE ACTIONS HAVE

BEEN CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS SECURITIES LITIGATION.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT YET FILED A CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT. AN ADDITIONAL PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION BASED ON THE SAME ALLEGATIONS WAS BROUGHT IN

NEW YORK STATE SUPREME COURT. THIS ACTION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFERRED TO, AND IS CURRENTLY PENDING IN, THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.

IN ADDITION, FIVE OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA. TWO OF THESE ACTIONS,

SECURITIES LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS ALLEGED FAILURE TO MAKE DISCLOSURE RELATING TO THE PRACTICE OF PAYING BROKERS COMMISSIONS ON A CONTINGENT BASIS. TWO DERIVATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST ALL CURRENT DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY, NAMING THE COMPANY AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT. IN

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO

DEFEND VIGOROUSLY; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD. THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY ITS

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED UNDER MINNESOTA LAW. AS PART OF THAT OBLIGATION, THE COMPANY WILL ADVANCE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES THEY INCUR IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS

IN PREVIOUS FILINGS, THE COMPANY REPORTED ON A SERIES OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND ONE MULTI-PARTY ACTION BROUGHT IN

VARIOUS COURTS AROUND THE UNITED STATES AGAINST CERTAIN OF TPCS SUBSIDIARIES, DOZENS OF OTHER INSURERS AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON COMPENSATION INSURANCE. THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE ACTIONS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR, AND GENERALLY ALLEGED THAT

THE DEFENDANTS CONSPIRED TO COLLECT EXCESSIVE OR IMPROPER PREMIUMS ON LOSS-SENSITIVE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE POLICIES IN VIOLATION OF STATE INSURANCE LAWS, ANTITRUST LAWS, AND STATE UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES LAWS. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE

ACTIONS DO NOT SPECIFY DAMAGES. TPC HAS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED THE ACTIONS, WITH ALL BUT A FEW OF THE ACTIONS HAVING BEEN DISMISSED TO DATE. IN ADDITION, THE PLAINTIFFS ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN CLASS CERTIFICATION HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. UNDER THE

PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS REMAINING EXPOSURE TO BE SIGNIFICANT.

FROM TIME TO TIME THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN PROCEEDINGS ADDRESSING DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY BE

INITIATED BY THE COMPANY OR THE REINSURERS AND MAY INVOLVE THE TERMS OF THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THE COVERAGE OF PARTICULAR CLAIMS, EXCLUSIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS COUNTERCLAIMS FOR RESCISSION OF THE AGREEMENTS. ONE OF THESE DISPUTES

IS THE ACTION DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH.

GULF, A

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TPC, BROUGHT AN ACTION ON MAY 22, 2003, AS AMENDED ON MAY 12, 2004, IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK (

GULF INSURANCE COMPANY V. TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL.

), AGAINST TRANSATLANTIC

REINSURANCE COMPANY (TRANSATLANTIC), XL REINSURANCE AMERICA, INC. (XL), ODYSSEY AMERICA REINSURANCE CORPORATION (ODYSSEY), EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE COMPANY (EMPLOYERS) AND GERLING GLOBAL REINSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA (GERLING), TO RECOVER AMOUNTS

DUE UNDER REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND RELATED TO GULFS FEBRUARY 2003 SETTLEMENT OF A COVERAGE DISPUTE UNDER A VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE PROTECTION INSURANCE POLICY. THE REINSURERS HAVE ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING RESCISSION OF THE

VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT. SEPARATE ACTIONS FILED BY TRANSATLANTIC AND GERLING HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE ORIGINAL GULF ACTION FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES. ON OCTOBER

1, 2003, GULF ENTERED INTO A FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH EMPLOYERS, AND ALL CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.

ON MAY 26, 2004, THE COURT DENIED GULFS MOTION TO DISMISS CERTAIN CLAIMS ASSERTED BY TRANSATLANTIC AND A JOINT MOTION BY TRANSATLANTIC, XL AND

ODYSSEY FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST GULF. DISCOVERY IS CURRENTLY PROCEEDING IN THE MATTERS. GULF DENIES THE REINSURERS ALLEGATIONS, BELIEVES THAT IT HAS A STRONG LEGAL BASIS TO COLLECT THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS AND

INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THE ACTIONS.

CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINUED

ON JULY 23, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION

OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $1.63 BILLION ($1.07 BILLION AFTER-TAX). THE COMPANY RECORDED THESE

ADJUSTMENTS AS CHARGES IN ITS INCOME STATEMENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. THROUGH AN INFORMAL COMMENT PROCESS, THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO THESE ADJUSTMENTS, AND THE

DIALOGUE IS ONGOING. SPECIFICALLY, THE STAFF HAS ASKED FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANYS ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN OF SPCS INSURANCE RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND PREMIUMS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AND HOW THOSE

ADJUSTMENTS MAY RELATE TO SPCS RESERVES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER. AFTER REVIEWING THE STAFFS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE. IF, HOWEVER,

THE STAFF DISAGREES, SOME OR ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS BEING DISCUSSED MAY NOT BE RECORDED AS CHARGES IN THE COMPANYS INCOME STATEMENT, THEREBY INCREASING NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2004 AND INCREASING SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, IN EACH CASE BY THE APPROXIMATE AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF THE CHANGE. THE EFFECT ON TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTS OF DEFERRED TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31,

2004 WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL. INCREASES TO GOODWILL AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WOULD BE REFLECTED ON THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET AS OF APRIL 1, 2004, EITHER DUE TO PURCHASE ACCOUNTING OR ADJUSTMENT OF SPCS RESERVES PRIOR TO THE

MERGER.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING

ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED BY MANAGEMENT, ARE UNDER THE GENERAL

OVERSIGHT OF THE COMPANYS AUDIT COMMITTEE.

THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.



PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES,

AND THAT OUR RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF OUR ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT

LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN

CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OR COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE STANDARD MEASURES ADOPTED BY MANAGEMENT IN MAKING ITS EVALUATION ARE THE MEASURES IN THE

INTERNAL-CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK PUBLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

BASED UPON ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE AT DECEMBER 31, 2004,

OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND AN OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED

ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND

PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1)

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY;

AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE ON ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR

OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

IN 2002, IN ORDER TO

ACHIEVE TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, A PROPOSAL WAS APPROVED BY SPC SHAREHOLDERS THAT CREATED THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE PLAN, WHICH IDENTIFIES A MAXIMUM BONUS POOL THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE FOR

POSSIBLE AWARD TO THE COMPANYS NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. IF A POOL IS AVAILABLE, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, REVIEWS BOTH THE COMPANYS AND THE INDIVIDUALS PERFORMANCE AND DETERMINES WHAT, IF ANY, AMOUNTS

WILL BE PAID UNDER THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE PLAN. GENERALLY, IF THE COMPANYS RETURN ON EQUITY (WHICH IS DETERMINED BY DIVIDING THE AFTER-TAX OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD BY BEGINNING TOTAL COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY) FOR A PERFORMANCE PERIOD IS GREATER THAN 8%, THE BONUS POOL AVAILABLE TO THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WILL BE EQUAL TO 1.5% OF AFTER-TAX OPERATING EARNINGS. IN ASSESSING THE COMPANYS AND THE INDIVIDUALS PERFORMANCE TO DETERMINE

WHAT, IF ANY, AMOUNTS WILL ACTUALLY BE AWARDED, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WEIGHS THE RECENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY OR A BUSINESS SEGMENT, AS APPLICABLE, DEPENDING ON THE EXECUTIVE, AS WELL AS OTHER SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES. IN

THIS REGARD, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE CONSIDERS OPERATING INCOME AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE INDICATOR OF RECENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, GENERALLY EXCLUSIVE OF THE IMPACT OF FACTORS BEYOND THE EXECUTIVES CONTROL, FOR EXAMPLE CATASTROPHES. THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ALSO CONSIDERS OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES, AS WELL AS THE DEGREE TO WHICH OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED AND OTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS THE STRATEGIC POSITIONING OF THE COMPANY OR THE APPLICABLE BUSINESS SEGMENT. FOR

BONUSES AND CAP AWARDS IN RESPECT OF 2004, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE CONSIDERED CORPORATE INTEGRATION AND EXPENSE REDUCTION AFTER THE MERGER OF TPC AND SPC AS IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES. THE AVAILABLE POOL FOR 2004 WAS $27.6 MILLION, OF WHICH THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AWARDED TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS $5.0 MILLION, COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY $3.7 MILLION IN CASH AND $1.3 MILLION IN SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK PURSUANT TO THE COMPANYS CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROGRAM.

(A)

BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY DEVELOPED A METHODOLOGY TO ALLOCATE NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND INVESTED ASSETS TO THE IDENTIFIED SEGMENTS. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS METHODOLOGY. IN 2002 AND 2003, NET INVESTMENT INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT WAS ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY, EXCEPT FOR THE PORTION EARNED ON THE INVESTMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, WHICH

WAS ALLOCATED BASED ON ASSIGNED CAPITAL.

(B)

EXPENSE ALLOCATIONS ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRESCRIBED STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. THESE PRACTICES MAKE A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF ALL EXPENSES TO THOSE PRODUCT LINES

WITH WHICH THEY ARE ASSOCIATED.
