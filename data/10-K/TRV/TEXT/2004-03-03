property-liability
insurance
our property-liability
insurance operations underwrite insurance and provide insurance-related
products and services to commercial and professional customers throughout the
united states and in selected international markets. our largest insurance
underwriting subsidiary is st. paul fire and marine
insurance
company (fire and marine). the primary sources of property-liability revenues
are premiums earned from insurance policies, income earned from the investment
portfolio and net realized gains from sales of investments. according to the most
recent industry statistics published in bests review with respect to
commercial lines property-liability insurers doing business in the united
states, our property-liability underwriting operations ranked as the
sixth-largest on the basis of 2002 direct written premiums.
principal departments and products
in
general, our property-liability insurance operations underwrite the following
types, or lines, of insurance coverages.
general liability, which provides coverage for
liability exposures including personal injury and property damage arising from
general business operations, products sold and completed work;
liability
coverages for corporations and nonprofit organizations, including their
directors and officers, and for a variety of professionals such as lawyers,
insurance agents and real estate agents;
property
insurance, which insures tangible property for loss, damage or loss of use;
commercial
multi-peril, which provides a combination of property coverage (for damages
such as those caused by fire, wind, hail, water, theft, and vandalism) and
liability coverage (for third-party liability from accidents occurring on the
insureds premises or arising out of their operations);
commercial
auto, which provides coverage for businesses against losses resulting from
their ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks, including losses
resulting from bodily injury to third parties, physical damage to an insureds
vehicle and property damage to other vehicles and other property;
workers
compensation, which provides coverage for employers for specified benefits
payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries, disabilities or
death to employees, without regard to fault;
inland
marine, which provides coverage for property which is generally mobile in
nature, such as contractors equipment or cargo being shipped by truck or rail,
as well as instrumentalities of transportation or communication such as
bridges, tunnels and computers, and certain property risks such as builders
risk;
aviation
and ocean marine insurance;
contract
surety bonds and commercial surety bonds; and
umbrella
coverages, which provide specified layers of coverage on accounts where we do
not provide the primary liability coverage.
further information about
these lines of business, including types of coverage that are specific to an
operating segment, are included in the segment descriptions that follow this
section.
through one or more lines
underwritten by our business segments, including property and general
liability, we are exposed to losses from environmental claims and mold claims. environmental
claims include claims of liability for alleged damage from hazardous or toxic
materials. the majority of our general liability policies include an absolute
pollution exclusion; however, in several business centers, particularly oil and gas and umbrella/excess& surplus lines in our specialty
commercial segment, we continue to underwrite new business with limited
pollution coverage. in addition, most business that we underwrite in the united
kingdom and ireland do not normally include absolute pollution exclusions. under
certain policies we underwrite, we are exposed to losses from claims of mold
and moisture infiltration, which can cause personal injury and damage to
property. certain policyholders have submitted claims to us under their
property and general liability polices that include damages related to the
presence
of mold.
predominantly, these mold claims are for property damage submitted under a
first-party property policy, or for construction defect third-party liability
submitted under a general liability policy. few personal injury claims related
to mold under workers compensation or general liability policies have been
submitted to us. the cause and type of damage of each property damage or bodily
injury incident involving mold determines whether the claim may be a covered
loss under a property policy or if there is a duty to defend and/or indemnify
an insured in a third-party claim. in addition, we have exposure to claims
arising from the use of asbestos in building materials and construction. the environmental
and asbestos claims section of managements discussion and analysis included
in this report provides additional information regarding our historical
exposure to and losses from asbestos and environmental claims.
property-liability underwriting segments
in the
first quarter of 2003, we revised our property-liability insurance business
segment reporting structure to reflect the manner in which those businesses are
managed. our property-liability underwriting operations consist of two segments
constituting our ongoing operations (specialty
commercial and commercial lines),
and one segment predominantly comprised of our runoff operations (other). the composition of those
respective segments is described in greater detail in the following discussion.
the following is a summary of changes made to our segments in the first quarter
of 2003.
our
surety& construction operations, previously reported together as a
separate specialty segment, are now separate components of our specialty commercial segment.
our
ongoing international operations and our ongoing operations at lloyds,
previously reported together as a separate specialty segment, are now separate
components of our specialty commercial
segment.
our
health care, reinsurance and other operations, each previously reported as a
separate runoff business segment, have been combined into a single other runoff segment and are under common
management. runoff means that we have ceased or plan to cease underwriting
business as soon as possible.
the
results of our participation in voluntary insurance pools, as well as loss
development on business underwritten prior to 1980 (prior to 1988 for business
acquired in our merger with usf&g corporation in 1998), previously included
in our commercial lines segment,
are now included in the other segment.
in addition to our participation in voluntary insurance pools, this prior year
business includes the majority of our environmental and asbestos liability
exposures. the oversight of these exposures is the responsibility of the same
management team responsible for oversight of the other components of the other segment.
in addition, in the fourth
quarter of 2003, our specialty programs
business center, previously reported in our specialty commercial segment, was
moved to our commercial lines segment to more accurately reflect the manner in
which this business is underwritten and managed. all data for 2002 and 2001 in
this report were restated to be consistent with the changes made to our segment
reporting structure in the first and fourth quarters of 2003. the following
discussion describes the composition of our three property-liability
underwriting segments.
specialty commercial.  this segment
includes business centers that we have designated specialty commercial
operations because each provides dedicated underwriting, claim and risk control
services that require specialized expertise, and each focuses exclusively on
the respective customers it serves. insurance coverage in these business
centers is often provided on proprietary insurance forms. this segment also
includes our ongoing specialty international operations, and our ongoing
operations at lloyds. the specialty commercial segment collectively generated
$4.50 billion of net earned premiums in 2003 (accounting for 64% of our
consolidated earned premium volume). the following discussion describes the
operations that comprise our specialty commercial segment.
the surety business center underwrites surety
bonds, which are agreements under which one party (the surety) guarantees to
another party (the owner or obligee) that a third party (the contractor or
principal) will perform in accordance with contractual or legal obligations. the
surety is responsible for evaluating the risk to be covered and for determining
if the principal meets the underwriting requirements for the bond. the premium
charged will reflect the size and type of the obligation. by offering a bond,
the surety is offering assurance that its customer will meet its obligations as
specified under the bond.
according to data
published by the surety association of america, our domestic surety operations
were the second-largest in the united states based on 2002 direct premiums
written. in addition to its u.s. operations, our surety business center also
includes afianzadora insurgentes, the leading surety underwriter in mexico, and
our canadian operations, st. paul guarantee, the largest surety bond
underwriter in canada.
for contract surety, we provide bid,
performance and payment bonds to a broad spectrum of clients specializing in
general contracting, highway and bridge construction, asphalt paving,
underground and pipeline construction, manufacturing, civil and heavy engineering,
and mechanical and electrical construction. bid bonds provide financial
assurance that bids have been submitted in good faith and that the contractor
intends to enter into the contract at the price bid and provide the required
performance and payment bonds. performance bonds require us to fulfill the
contractors obligations to the obligee should the contractor fail to perform
under the contract. payment bonds guarantee that the contractor will pay
certain subcontractor, labor and material bills associated with a project.
for commercial surety, which comprises bonds
covering obligations often required by law, the bonds that we currently
underwrite are as follows.
license
and permit bonds, which are required by statutes or regulations for a number of
purposes, including guaranteeing the payment of certain taxes and fees and
providing consumer protection as a condition to granting licenses related to
selling real estate, including tax and customs bonds;
reclamation
bonds, which cover reclamation costs for mining and other industrial companies;
fiduciary
bonds, which are required by statutes, courts or contracts for the protection
of those on whose behalf a fiduciary (such as an executor of an estate or a
guardian of a minor) acts, including probate bonds and depository bonds;
court
bonds, which are bonds that may be required of either a plaintiff or a
defendant in a lawsuit;
public
official bonds, which are required by statutes and regulations to guarantee the
lawful and faithful performance of the duties of office by public officials;
indemnity
bonds, which are obligations to hold a third party harmless of damages related
to an underlying obligation to perform, maintain or pay;
workers
compensation self-insurer bonds, which are required by statutes and regulations
to guarantee the payment of workers compensation benefits to injured workers
of companies that wish to self-insure those obligations;
transfer
agent indemnity bonds, which protect the issuer of securities and the transfer
agent against the possibility that a lost share certificate may be presented
later by an innocent purchaser for value; and
other
miscellaneous bonds.
like contract surety
bonds, commercial surety bonds expose us to the risk that the principal (e.g.,
the fiduciary in a fiduciary bond or the mining company in a reclamation bond)
will not perform the duties required by the contract, applicable law or
regulation. accordingly, we underwrite and price these products by analyzing,
among other things, the principals creditworthiness and ability to perform.
certain sectors of our
commercial surety business tend to be characterized by low frequency but
potentially high severity losses. in october2000, we made a strategic
decision to significantly reduce the exposures in these sectors. since that
time, we had reduced our total commercial surety gross open bond exposure by
over 56% by december31, 2003.
within these sectors of
our commercial surety business, we have exposures related to a small number of
accounts, which are in various stages of bankruptcy proceedings. in addition,
certain other accounts have experienced deterioration in creditworthiness since
we issued bonds to them. given the current economic climate and its impact on
these companies, we may experience an increase in claims and, possibly, incur
high severity losses. such losses would be recognized in the period in which
the claims are filed and determined to be a valid loss under the provisions of
the surety bond issued.
we continue to exit the
segments of the commercial surety market that are characterized by low
frequency but potentially high severity bonds by ceasing to write new business
and, where possible, terminating the outstanding bonds. we continue to be a
market for traditional commercial surety business, which includes low-limit
business such as license and permit, probate, public official, and customs
bonds.
our construction business center offers a
variety of products and services, including traditional insurance, consisting
of workers compensation, general liability and commercial auto coverages, and
other risk management solutions, to a broad range of contractors and parties
responsible for construction projects.
financial & professional services provides property
and liability coverages for financial institutions, professional liability and
management liability coverages for corporations and nonprofit organizations
against losses caused by the negligence or misconduct of named directors and
officers, and errors and omissions coverages for a variety of professionals
such as lawyers, insurance agents and real estate agents for liability from
errors and omissions committed in the course of professional conduct or
practice. although we have not observed any notable increase in directors and
officers claims in this business center, in view of recent allegations of
corporate malfeasance and professional misconduct, and the sarbanes-oxley act
of 2002 (and regulations issued by the securities and exchange commission
pursuant to that law), the frequency and severity of such claims could
increase.
technology offers
a portfolio of specialty products and services to companies involved in
telecommunications, information technology, health sciences and electronics
manufacturing. these products include
property, commercial auto, general liability, workers compensation, umbrella,
internet liability, and technology errors and omissions coverages. the services
provided by this business center include dedicated underwriting, risk control
and specialized claim handling.
the umbrella/excess and surplus lines group consists
of two distinct business units. specialty
excess and umbrella focuses on umbrella and excess liability
business for retail agents and brokers, where other insurance companies are
providing the primary coverage. the coverages underwritten are typically
commercial auto, general liability and product liability. umbrella coverage may
also be underwritten over a company that retains risk or has a self-insured
retention, instead of a scheduled underlying policy. the excess& surplus lines unit
underwrites non-admitted individual risk business for established wholesale
distributors. the coverages typically underwritten include commercial auto,
general liability and product liability.
the e&s underwriting facilities business
centerunderwrites liability and property facilities
produced by wholesalers and managing general agents, which are licensed
insurance agents that manage all or part of an insurers customers with unique
requirementsprimarily those with moderate to high hazard exposures requiring
expertise in the surplus lines marketplace and the ability to use policy forms
not subject to regulatory requirements. coverages include property, commercial
auto, general liability and a small amount of umbrella.
public sector services markets
insurance products and services to municipalities, counties, indian nation
gaming and selected special government districts, including water and sewer
utilities, and non-rail transit authorities. the policies written by this
business center typically cover property, commercial auto, general liability,
workers compensation and errors and omissions exposures.
discover re, which
principally provides commercial auto liability, general liability, workers
compensation, and property coverages, serves retail brokers and insureds that
are committed to the alternative risk transfer market. alternative risk
transfer techniques are typically utilized by sophisticated insureds that are
financially able to assume a substantial portion of their own losses. discover re is organized in two underwriting units, each of
which underwrites primary insurance in connection with arrangements that
involve the client or a captive insurer agreeing to bear much of the covered
risk. the individual risk unit markets products to individual insureds that are
comfortable retaining the more predictable layer of their expected losses
through either large deductible or true self-insured retention programs. under
a large deductible structure, we are exposed not only to the risk of loss under
the policy but also to the risk of the insureds inability or unwillingness to
pay its obligations under the terms of the agreement. we mitigate the latter
risk by collateralizing all or a portion of the expected losses in the insureds
retained layer. the second underwriting unit is the captive/program unit, which
focuses on captive business. similar to the individual risk accounts, the
captives retain the more predictable frequency layer of expected losses, with discover re providing excess coverage above the captives
retention. in some instances the captive/program unit may retain little or no
risk, but earns revenues primarily from fees collected for providing access to
policies from an admitted insurance company.
oil and gas provides
specialized property and liability products for customers involved in the
exploration and production of oil and gas including operators, drillers and
servicing contractors. the policies written by this business center insure
drilling rigs, natural gas facilities, pipelines, production and gathering
platforms, and cover risks including physical damage, liability and business
interruption.
ocean marine underwrites
a diverse portfolio of coverages for all forms of marine transportation and the
companies that serve them, as well as other businesses involved in
international trade. our product offerings fall under four main coverage
categories: marine liability; cargo;
hull and machinery, protection and indemnity; and marine property-liability.
personal catastrophe risk underwrites
personal property coverages in certain states exposed to earthquakes and
hurricanes, including principally california, texas and florida. as with our
commercial catastrophe risk coverages underwritten in our commercial lines
segment, a single loss event may produce heavy losses under a number of
policies. we attempt to manage the risk to which we are exposed through natural
catastrophe reinsurance coverage. the natural catastrophe risk management
section of managements discussion and analysis included in this report, which
includes a discussion of our natural catastrophe risk management procedures, is
incorporated herein by reference.
our international& lloyds operation
consists of the following components: our ongoing operations at lloyds, and
our ongoing specialty commercial operations outside of the united states,
including our global accounts business center (collectively referred to
hereafter as international specialties).
lloyds is a subscription
insurance market in which member individuals and firms participate to provide
insurance to customers seeking coverage for a variety of risks. the members of
lloyds are organized into syndicates consisting of one or more members. the
members provide underwriting capacity with which the syndicate makes coverage
available to particular customers. syndicates are operated by managing agencies
that receive fees in respect of the services they provide in both underwriting
and claims administration. coverage is placed by insurance brokers acting on
behalf of insureds.
in 2003 at lloyds, we
underwrote four principal lines of businessaviation, marine, global property
and personal linesthrough a single syndicate for which we provide 100% of the
capital. this syndicate
was
established in 1996 as syndicate 1211 and re-branded as syndicate 5000 in november2002.
aviation underwrites a broad spectrum of international airline, manufacturer,
airport and general aviation business. marine underwrites energy, cargo and
hull coverages. global property underwrites property coverages worldwide. personal
lines provides specialized accident and health coverages for international
clients, including personal accident, kidnap and ransom, and payment protection
insurance. prior to 2003, the aviation and personal lines businesses were
underwritten through other syndicates that we managed and in which we
participated with other members of lloyds. we do not provide syndicate 5000
with direct capital contributions, but rather obtain bank letters of credit to
support the syndicates insurance exposure. we are liable, however, if these
letters of credit are called upon to cover any losses of the syndicate and must
reimburse the banks that issue the letters of credit for any amounts they pay
on our behalf.
in addition to the
property-liability business we underwrite at lloyds, we also manage, and have
made a commitment to provide 13% of the capacity of, syndicate 779 at lloyds,
which underwrites specialty term life insurance to individuals primarily in the
united kingdom and other european countries.
in december2003, we
completed the sale of camperdown uk limited, one of our lloyds corporate names
and the vehicle for our participation on the 2003 and prior years of account,
to foltus investments limited. we recognized a $2 million pretax gain on this
transaction. in 2003, fire and marine entered into a 100% quota share
reinsurance agreement directly with syndicate 5000 that in effect transferred
syndicate 5000s underwriting results for the 2003 year of account to fire and
marine. in order to continue our ongoing operations at lloyds, we activated
two corporate names that will be used for 2004 and future years of account to
underwrite syndicate 5000 business.
our ongoing international
specialties are located in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of
ireland, where we offer specialized insurance and risk management services to a
variety of industry sectors. our ongoing international operations primarily
underwrite employers liability (similar to workers compensation coverage in
the u.s.), public and product liability (the equivalent of general liability),
professional indemnity (similar to directors and officers or errors and
omissions coverage), motor (similar to automobile coverage in the united
states) and property. the global underwriting business center underwrites home-foreign
business, representing coverage for a u.s. organizations property-liability
exposures in a foreign country, and reverse-flow business, which involves coverage
of a foreign organizations property or liability exposures located in the
united states, as part of a global program.
commercial lines.  this segment
generated $2.22 billion of net earned premiums in 2003, accounting for 31% of
our consolidated net earned premium volume. the commercial lines segment includes our small commercial, middle
market commercial and property
solutions business centers, as well as the results of our limited
involvement in insurance pools. the small
commercial business center services commercial firms that typically
have between one and fifty employees through its proprietary st. paul
mainstreet(sm) and st. paul advantage(sm) products, with
a particular focus on offices, wholesalers, retailers, artisan contractors and
other service risks.
the middle market commercial business center
offers comprehensive insurance coverages for a wide variety of manufacturing,
wholesale, service and retail enterprises for which annual insurance costs
typically range from $75,000 to $1 million, as well as programs for selected
industries that are national in scope and have similar risk characteristics
such as franchises and associations. the majority of these programs were
formerly classified as a separate specialty programs business center in our
specialty commercial segment but were reclassified in 2003 to our middle market commercial business center
in the commercial lines segment to more accurately reflect the manner in which
this business is underwritten and managed. specific lines of insurance
underwritten through these programs include property, commercial auto, general
liability, workers compensation, inland marine, errors and omissions, umbrella
and fidelity. underwriting guidelines, premiums and policy forms issued vary by
program and by jurisdiction because of local market conditions and legal
requirements. coverage may be on a primary or an excess basis, depending on how
the coverage is structured for a particular insured. because of the
national
scope of the programs underwritten, we may be exposed to unusually large losses
if a single industry whose members are insured through an association is
adversely affected by a major event or development, to the extent that the
event or development causes losses throughout the industry. the middle market commercial business center
also offers loss-sensitive casualty programs, including significant deductible
and self-insured retention options, for the higher end of the middle market
sector.
the property solutions business center
combines our large account property business with the commercial portion of our
catastrophe risk business and allows us to take a unified approach to large
commercial property risks. large accounts are typically those with property
premiums greater than $100,000. this business center focuses on underwriting
property coverages for real properties exposed to light to moderate hazards,
such as hotels and office buildings, rather than high hazard properties such as
petrochemical, mining and other basic process industries. many of the products
underwritten by this business center are structured products, in which we write
coverage for a specified layer of risk and other insurers underwrite other
layers. some of the policies underwritten by this business center expose us to
catastrophe risk, principally earthquake and hurricane, in which a single loss
event can produce heavy losses under a number of policies. the structuring, or
layering, of risk as described above results in our being less exposed (before
the effect of reinsurance) to such catastrophe risk than if we wrote
traditional full limits property policies. to further manage our risk, we
purchase reinsurance coverage for catastrophe exposures. our efforts to manage
the risk to which we are exposed from natural catastrophe coverage are
described in the natural catastrophe risk management section of this report.
results from our
participation in involuntary insurance pools and associations are also included
in the commercial lines segment. state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in
mandatory property-liability pooling arrangements that provide insurance
coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage
voluntarily provided by private insurers. we limit our participation in
these pools and associations to the extent possible.
other.  this
segment includes the results of the lines of business we placed in runoff in
late 2001 and early 2002, including our former health care and reinsurance
segments, and the results of the following international operations: our runoff
operations at lloyds, including our participation in the insuring of the lloyds
central fund; unionamerica, the london-based underwriting unit acquired as part
of our purchase of mmi in 2000; and various international operations we decided
to exit at the end of 2001. we have a management team in place for these
operations, seeking to ensure that our outstanding claim obligations are
settled in an expeditious and economical manner. this segment also includes the
results of our participation in voluntary insurance pools, as well as loss
development on business underwritten prior to 1980 (prior to 1988 for business
acquired in our merger with usf&g corporation in 1998). in addition to our
participation in voluntary insurance pools, this prior year business includes
the majority of our environmental and asbestos liability exposures. the
oversight of these exposures is the responsibility of the same management team
responsible for oversight of the other components of the other segment.
our health care operation historically provided
a wide range of medical liability insurance products and services for health
care providers throughout the entire health care delivery system, including
individual physicians, physician groups, hospitals, managed care organizations
and long-term care facilities, as well as certain traditional medical care
coverages. products include coverages for healthcare professionals (physicians
and surgeons, dental professionals and nurses); individual healthcare
facilities (including hospitals, long-term care facilities and other facilities
such as laboratories); and entire systems, such as hospital networks and
managed care systems. typically our health
care operation underwrote coverages on the basis of an entire
clinic, hospital or other organization, so that we are exposed to losses from
the malpractice of any one practitioner on the staff of, or with privileges at,
the organization. policies written by this segment are subject to high severity
of claims. in the fourth quarter of 2001, we announced our intention to exit
the medical liability insurance market, subject to applicable regulatory
requirements.
in the years prior to
2002, our reinsurance operation
(formerly known as st. paul re) generally underwrote treaty and facultative
reinsurance for property, liability, ocean marine, surety, certain specialty
classes of coverage, and nontraditional reinsurance, which provided limited
traditional underwriting risk protection combined with financial risk
protection. in late 2001, we announced our intention to cease underwriting
certain types of reinsurance coverages and narrow our geographic presence in
2002. in november2002, we transferred our ongoing reinsurance operations
to platinum underwriters holdings, ltd. (platinum) while retaining
liabilities generally for reinsurance contracts incepting prior to january1,
2002, as well as all liabilities relating to the flooding in europe in august2002.
our
remaining in-force pre-2002 reinsurance exposures are principally in the
following areas:
north
american casualty, which offered customers with exposures in the united states
and canada the following types of casualty reinsurance coverages: general,
workers compensation, auto, non-medical professional, directors and officers,
employment practices, surplus lines, umbrella and environmental impairment as
well as accident and health reinsurance coverages;
international,
which underwrote property and casualty reinsurance for customers domiciled
outside of north america and marine and aerospace reinsurance for customers
located throughout the world;
finite
risk, which underwrote non-traditional reinsurance treaties including
multi-year excess-of-loss treaties, aggregate stop loss treaties, finite quota
share treaties, loss portfolio transfers, and adverse loss development covers;
and
certain
bond, credit and financial risk coverages.
the other component of this segment includes
the results of the following insurance operations.
runoff operations at lloyds, primarily
consisting of the following lines of business written through four syndicates,
across which our ownership ranged from 54% to 100% and which ceased
underwriting in 2001 or the first quarter of 2002. these syndicates underwrote
the following business (both u.s. and non-u.s. coverages): casualty insurance
and reinsurance, non-marine reinsurance, professional liability insurance
(particularly for financial institutions, and directors and officers
liability insurance) and our participation in the insuring of the lloyds
central fund.
unionamerica, the london-based
underwriting unit acquired as part of our purchase of mmi in 2000. unionamerica
underwrote liability and property coverages, including medical malpractice and
other professional liability and directors and officers liability, both
inside and outside of lloyds, on both an insurance and excess-of-loss
reinsurance basis.
all
other international runoff lines of business we decided to exit at the end of
2001, consisting of health care business in the united kingdom, canada and
ireland, as well as our underwriting operations in germany, france, the
netherlands, argentina, mexico (excluding surety business), spain, australia,
new zealand, botswana and south africa. in late 2002, we sold our operations in
argentina, mexico and spain. in 2003, we sold our operations in botswana.
the
results of our participation in voluntary insurance pools, as well as loss
development on business underwritten prior to 1980 (prior to 1988 for business
acquired in our merger with usf&g corporation in 1998). in addition to our
participation in voluntary insurance pools, this prior year business includes
the majority of our environmental and asbestos liability exposures.
we have a management team
in place for the operations comprising this category, to ensure that our outstanding
claim obligations are settled in an expeditious and economical manner.

principal markets and methods of distribution
our insurance operations
in the united states are licensed to transact business in all 50 states, the
district of columbia, puerto rico, guam and the virgin islands. at least five
percent of fire and marines 2003 direct written premiums were produced in each
of california, new york, texas and florida.
our insurance business in
the united states is produced primarily through over 5,000 independent
insurance agencies and insurance brokers. the needs of agents, brokers and
policyholders are addressed through approximately 115 offices located
throughout the united states. discover re, a component of our specialty
commercial segment, underwrites alternative risk transfer business from its
farmington, ct headquarters and from regional offices in atlanta, pittsburgh,
houston and san francisco.
our international
operations are headquartered in london and underwrite insurance primarily
through domestic operations in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of
ireland. we also underwrite surety business in mexico.
through our involvement at
lloyds, we have access to insurance markets in virtually every country in the
world. at our ongoing operations at lloyds, we underwrite property-liability
business through a single syndicate (syndicate 5000) and specialty life
insurance through our 13% participation in syndicate 779. our managing agency,
operating under the name st. paul syndicate management ltd., underwrites
business for these syndicates, which represent approximately 2% of lloyds
total capacity.
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses
general information.  when
claims are made by or against policyholders, any amounts that our underwriting
operations pay or expect to pay to the claimant are referred to as losses. the
costs of investigating, resolving and processing these claims are referred to
as loss adjustment expenses (lae). our loss reserves reflect estimates of
total losses and lae we will ultimately have to pay under insurance policies,
surety bonds and reinsurance agreements. the reserves for unpaid losses and lae
at december31, 2003 cover claims that were incurred not only in 2003 but
also in prior years. they include estimates of the total cost of claims that
have already been reported but not yet settled (case reserves),
and
those that have been incurred but not yet reported (ibnr reserves). loss
reserves are reduced for estimates of salvage and subrogation.
loss reserves for tabular
workers compensation business and certain assumed reinsurance contracts are
discounted to present value. tabular workers compensation reserves are
indemnity reserves that are calculated using discounts determined with
reference to actuarial tables that incorporate interest and contingencies such
as mortality, remarriage, inflation or recovery from disability applied to a
reasonably determinable payment stream. reserves for medical costs associated
with the work place injury and reserves for loss adjustment expenses are not
discounted. additional information about these discounted liabilities is set
forth in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this
report. during 2003, $2 million of discount was amortized and $5 million of
additional discount was accrued.
because many of the
coverages we offer involve claims that may not ultimately be settled for many
years after they are incurred, subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure
to losses are an integral and necessary component of our loss reserving process.
we record our reserves by considering a range of estimates bounded by a high
and low point. within that range, we record our best estimate. we continually
review our reserves, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to
analyze current claim costs, frequency and severity data, and prevailing
economic, social and legal factors. we adjust reserves established in prior
years as loss experience develops and new information becomes available. adjustments
to previously estimated reserves are reflected in results in the year in which
they are made.
while
we believe our reported reserves make a reasonable provision for all of our
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations, it should be noted that
the process of estimating required reserves does, by its very nature, involve
uncertainty. the level of uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the
existence of long-tail coverages (which we consider to be business in which the
majority of coverages involve average loss payment lags of three years or more
beyond the expiration of the policy), and changes in claim handling practices. many
of our insurance subsidiaries have underwritten long-tail coverages, and the
primary lines of business fitting that criterion are general liability, workers
compensation and casualty excess reinsurance. in addition, claim handling
practices change and evolve over the years. for example, new initiatives are
commenced, claim offices are reorganized and relocated, claim handling
responsibilities of individual adjusters are changed, use of a call center is
increased, use of technology is increased, caseload issues and case reserving
practices are monitored more frequently, etc. furthermore, establishing
reserves for our reinsurance and retrocessional business is influenced by our
need to rely on the ceding insurers and reinsurers for information regarding
reported claims. however, all of the above factors are sources of uncertainty
that we have recognized in establishing our reserves.
the loss and loss
adjustment expense reserves section of managements discussion and analysis
included in item 7 of this report includes more information about our loss
reserves, including an analysis of our long-tail exposures.
ten-year development.  the
table that follows presents a development of net loss and lae reserve
liabilities and payments for the years 1993 through 2003. the top line on the
table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae, net of
reinsurance recoverables, recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the
years indicated.
the table excludes the
reserves and activity of economy fire and casualty company and its subsidiaries
(economy), which were included in the sale of our standard personal insurance
operations to metropolitan property and casualty insurance company (metropolitan)
in 1999. the table does, however, include reserves and activity for the
non-economy standard personal insurance business that was sold to metropolitan,
since we remain liable for claims on non-economy standard personal insurance
policies that result from losses occurring prior to sept. 30, 1999 (the closing
date of the sale). the reconciliation of loss reserves table in note 8 to our
consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this
report
includes the reserve activity related to the non-economy claims, as activity
on reserves of discontinued operations.
in december2003, we
completed the sale of camperdown uk limited, one of our lloyds corporate names
and the vehicle for our participation on the 2003 and prior years of account,
to foltus investments limited. the $944 million of net reserves transferred as
part of the sale are excluded from net reserves for the year ended december31,
2003 in the following table. years prior to 2003 in the table include the
camperdown uk limited reserves, as well as loss development and payments
related to those reserves.
when we acquire an
insurance underwriting company, we include loss development for the acquired
company in the following table beginning with the date of acquisition; however,
that development includes activity from periods prior to our acquisition.
the upper portion of the
table, which shows the re-estimated amounts relating to the previously recorded
liabilities, is based upon experience as of the end of each succeeding year. these
estimates are either increased or decreased as further information becomes
known about individual claims and as changes in the trend of claim frequency
and severity become apparent.
the cumulative redundancy
(deficiency) line on the table for any given year represents the aggregate
change in the estimates for all years subsequent to the year the reserves were
initially established. for example, the 1994 net reserve of $12,997 million
developed to $12,227 million, or a $770 million redundancy, by the end of 1996.
by the end of 2003, the 1994 reserve had developed a redundancy of $1,812
million. the changes in the estimate of 1994 loss reserves were reflected in
operations during the past nine years. likewise, the deficiency that developed
with respect to year-end 2001 reserves (primarily related to our medical
liability business) was reflected in our results of operations for 2003 and
2002.
the middle portion of the
table represents a reconciliation between the net reserve liability as shown on
the top line of the table and the gross reserve liability as shown on our
balance sheet. this portion of the table also presents the gross re-estimated
reserve liability as of the end of the latest re-estimation period (december31,
2003) and the related re-estimated reinsurance recoverable.
the lower portion of the
table presents the cumulative amounts paid with respect to the previously
recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. for example, as of december31,
2003, $9,640 million of the currently estimated $11,185 million of net losses
and lae that have been incurred for the years up to and including 1994 have
been paid. thus, as of december31, 2003, it is estimated that $1,545
million of net incurred losses and lae have yet to be paid for the years up to
and including 1994.
caution should be
exercised in evaluating the information shown in this table. it should be noted
that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior
periods. for example, the portion of the development shown for year-end 1999
reserves that relates to 1994 losses is included in the cumulative redundancy
(deficiency) for the years 1994 through 1999.
in addition, the table
presents calendar year data. it does not present accident or policy year
development data, which some readers may be more accustomed to analyzing. the
social, economic and legal conditions and other trends which have had an impact
on the changes in the estimated liability in the past are not necessarily
indicative of the future. accordingly, readers are cautioned against
extrapolating any conclusions about future results from the information
presented in this table.
for additional information
regarding our loss reserve liabilities, see note 8 to our consolidated
financial statements included in item 8 of this report, which includes a
reconciliation of beginning and ending loss reserve liabilities for each of the
years 2003, 2002 and 2001. in addition, see the loss and loss adjustment
expense reserves, environmental and asbestos claims and other sections of
managements discussion and analysis included in item 7 of this report.

natural catastrophe
risk management
our property-liability insurance operations expose us
to claims arising out of natural catastrophes, as well as terrorism. natural
catastrophes can be caused by various events, but losses are principally driven
by hurricanes and earthquakes. the incidence and severity of natural
catastrophes and terrorist attacks are inherently unpredictable and may
materially reduce our profitability in a given period or even harm our
financial condition. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of
both the total amount of insured exposure in the affected area and the severity
of the event.
most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic
areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage,
especially in areas that are heavily populated. most of the catastrophe-related
claims in our ongoing businesses in the past five years have related to
commercial property coverages in the united states. the geographic distribution
of our business subjects us to natural catastrophe exposure principally from
hurricanes in florida and the mid-atlantic, northeast, and gulf coast regions,
as well as earthquakes in california, along the new madrid fault line and in
the pacific northwest region.
we attempt to estimate the impact of certain
catastrophic events using catastrophe models developed by outside vendors. models
are applied to evaluate our exposure to losses arising from individual
contracts and in the aggregate. underwriting controls and systems exist to
ensure that individual contracts conform to our risk tolerance, fit within our
existing exposure portfolio, and are priced at appropriate levels.
we rely significantly on reinsurance to limit our
exposure to natural catastrophes. reinsurance exists both at an account level
and at the portfolio level, where we purchase a specific natural catastrophe
reinsurance treaty. in the event that reinsurance capacity providing natural
catastrophe protection becomes limited, we would adjust our direct exposures
accordingly.
there can be no assurance
that our underwriting risk management procedures and our reinsurance programs
will limit actual losses to a level consistent with our risk tolerance. losses
from an individual catastrophe, or a series of catastrophes, may materially exceed
such amount. actual results may vary from the expectations developed in our
catastrophe modeling, and such variances could negatively impact our reinsurers
and the related reinsurance recoverables.
ceded reinsurance
purpose. when we purchase reinsurance or cede
insurance premiums and risks, other insurers or reinsurers agree to share
certain risks that we have underwritten. the primary purpose of reinsurance is
to limit a ceding insurers maximum net loss from individually large or
aggregate risks as well as to provide protection against catastrophes. our
reinsurance program is generally managed from a corporate risk-tolerance
perspective. reinsurance contracts addressing specific business center risks
are utilized on a limited basis to cover unique exposures as necessary. our
reinsurance program addresses risk through a combination of per-risk
reinsurance and reinsurance contracts protecting against the aggregation of
risk exposures. facultative reinsurance, which covers specific risks, is also
used to supplement our reinsurance program. until the transfer of our ongoing
reinsurance operations to platinum in november2002, we underwrote assumed
reinsurance coverages on a worldwide basis.
price increases and pressures on contract terms and
conditions continue in the reinsurance market. despite these constraints, our
reinsurance program continues to support our primary underwriting reinsurance
needs, particularly as increases in rates and reductions in limits also
continue in the reinsurance market.
creditworthiness
of reinsurers. approximately
94% of our reinsurance recoverable balances at december31, 2003 were with
reinsurance companies having financial strength ratings of a- or higher by a.m
best or standard& poors, were from state sponsored facilities or
reinsurance pools, or were collateralized reinsurance programs associated with
certain of our insurance operations. we have an
internal credit security
committee, which uses a comprehensive credit risk review process in selecting
our reinsurers. this process considers such factors as ratings by major ratings
agencies, financial condition, parental support, operating practices, and
market news and developments. the credit security committee convenes quarterly
to evaluate these factors and take action on our approved list of reinsurers,
as necessary.
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible
reinsurance, which is evaluated and adjusted on a regular basis to reflect
disputed coverages and changing market and credit conditions. our allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance as a percentage of total reinsurance recoverable
balances was 1.9% and 1.5% as of december31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
in
2001, we entered into two aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties. one of
these treaties was corporate-wide, with coverage triggered when our insurance
losses and lae across all lines of business reached a certain level, as
prescribed by terms of the treaty (the corporate program). we did not enter
into such a treaty in 2002 or 2003. additionally, our reinsurance operation was
impacted by cessions made under a separate treaty in 2001 and 2002 unrelated to
the corporate treaty. the combined impact of these treaties (together, the reinsurance
treaties) is included in the table that follows.

the $35 million of negative losses and loss adjustment

primarily resulted from a commutation of a portion of that treaty. note 15 to
our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report provides a
schedule of ceded reinsurance and additional information about the reinsurance
treaties.
until the transfer of our
ongoing reinsurance operations to platinum underwriters holdings, ltd. (platinum)
in november2002, we underwrote assumed reinsurance coverages on a
worldwide basis. we remain liable on all reinsurance contracts with inception
dates prior to january1, 2002, as well as on certain 2002 contracts that
were not transferred to platinum. note 19 to our consolidated financial
statements in item 8 of this report provides more information about the
transfer of operations to platinum.

law the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 (tria). tria established a
temporary federal program which requires u.s. and other insurers to offer
coverage in their commercial property and casualty policies for losses
resulting from terrorists acts committed by foreign persons or interests in
the united states or with respect to specified u.s. air carriers, vessels or
missions abroad. the coverage offered may not differ materially from the terms,
amounts and other coverage limitations applicable to other policy coverages. these
requirements terminate at the end of 2004 unless the secretary of the treasury
extends them to 2005.
under tria, the u.s. secretary of the treasury
determines whether an act is a covered terrorist act, and if it is covered,
losses resulting from that act ultimately are shared among insurers, the
federal government and policyholders. generally, insurers pay all losses to
policyholders, retaining a defined deductible and 10% of losses above that
deductible. the federal government will reimburse insurers for 90% of losses
above the deductible and, under certain circumstances, the federal government
will require insurers to levy surcharges on policyholders to recoup for the
federal government its reimbursements paid.
an insurers deductible in
2003 was 7% of the insurers 2002 direct earned premiums, and rises to 10% of
2003 direct earned premiums in 2004 and, if the program continues in 2005, 15%
of 2004 direct earned premiums in 2005. federal reimbursement of the insurance
industry is limited to $100 billion in each of 2003, 2004 and 2005, and no
insurer that has met its deductible shall be liable for the payment of its
portion of the aggregate industry insured loss that exceeds $100 billion,
thereby capping the insurance industrys and each insurers ultimate exposure
to terrorist acts covered by tria.
tria voided terrorist exclusions in policies in-force
on november26, 2002 to the extent of the tria coverage required to be
offered and imposed requirements on insurers to offer the tria coverage to
policyholders at rates chosen by the insurers on policies in-force on november26,
2002 and all policies renewed or newly offered thereafter. policyholders may
accept or decline coverage at the offered rate and, with respect to policies
in-force on november26, 2002, tria coverage remains in effect until the
policyholder fails to purchase the coverage within a specified period following
the insurers rate quotation for the tria coverage. we have fully implemented
our long-term rating plans in all states.
we continue to monitor trias impact on the insurance
industry generally and on us specifically. our domestic insurance subsidiaries
and certain business we underwrite through lloyds are subject to tria and, in
the event of a terrorist act covered by tria, coverage would attach after
losses of approximately $690 million (calculated based on 10% of our
tria-qualifying calendar year 2003 direct earned premium total). accordingly,
trias federal reimbursement provisions alone do not protect us from losses
from foreign terrorist acts that could be material to our results of operations
or financial condition. furthermore, there is substantial uncertainty in
determining the appropriate rates for offering tria coverage (and coverage for
terrorist acts generally), and our quoted rates could be too low and attract
poor risks or, alternatively, could be higher than our competitors and result
in the loss of business. there are numerous interpretive issues in connection
with trias implementation by the secretary of the treasury that remain to be
resolved, including the timing of federal reimbursement for tria losses, the
standards for obtaining the federal reimbursement and the mechanisms for
allocating losses exceeding insurers deductibles. we currently have property
reinsurance that would cover only a portion of our deductible. in april2003,
we renewed our terrorism reinsurance coverage, as described in the following
discussion. there can be no assurance tria will achieve its objective of
creating a viable private insurance market for terrorism coverage prior to trias
expiration, and rates and forms used by us and our competitors may vary widely
in the future.
regardless of tria, some
state insurance regulators do not permit terrorism exclusions in various
coverages we write, and currently, we have not excluded coverage for terrorist
acts by domestic terrorists (e.g., the oklahoma bombing) in our domestic
coverages, or resulting from terrorist acts occurring outside the united states
from our international coverages. accordingly, our exposure to losses from
terrorist acts is not limited to tria coverages. losses from terrorists acts,
whether arising under tria coverages or otherwise, could be material to our
results of operations and financial condition.
purchase of
terrorism coverage and exposure to future terrorist events
after the terrorist
attacks in september2001, reinsurers, in general, specifically excluded
terrorism coverage from property reinsurance treaties that subsequently renewed.
as a result, in the second quarter of 2002, we purchased limited specific
terrorism coverage in the form of two separate property reinsurance treaties. those
treaties expired on april1, 2003, on which date we renewed our coverage
in the form of a combined per-risk and catastrophe terrorism occurrence treaty.
the treaty provides both certified and non-certified tria coverage. (to be tria
certified, the terrorist act must be sponsored by an international group or
state and damage caused must exceed a financial threshold, whereas
non-certified coverage refers to acts of domestic terrorism). in addition, we
secured non-certified tria terrorism coverage in our standard property
reinsurance treaty renewals in april2003 as part of our overall ceded
reinsurance program. we renewed the majority of our reinsurance treaties
covering workers
compensation
in july2003, and the majority of treaties covering general liability
business in august2003; those renewals included both certified and
non-certified tria coverage. generally, our reinsurance treaties do not cover
acts of terrorism involving nuclear, biological or chemical events. there can
be no assurance that we will be able to secure terrorism reinsurance coverage
on expiring treaties each year.
property-liability
investment operations segment
our board of directors approves the overall investment
plan for the companies within the st. pauls property-liability operations. each
subsidiary develops its own specific investment policy tailored to comply with
domestic laws and regulations and the overall corporate investment plan. the
primary objectives of those plans are to ensure our ability to meet our
liabilities, primarily consisting of insurance claim payments, and, having done
that, to increase our shareholders equity. the funds we invest are generated
by underwriting cash flows, consisting of the premiums collected less losses
and expenses paid, and by investment cash flows, consisting of income received
on existing investments and proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of
investments.
the majority of funds available for investment are
deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, intermediate-term
taxable u.s. government, corporate and mortgage-backed bonds, and tax-exempt
u.s. municipal bonds. we also invest much smaller amounts in equity securities,
venture capital and real estate. the latter three investment classes have the
potential for higher returns but also involve varying degrees of risk,
including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.
the following discussion provides more information on
each of our invested asset classes.
fixed income securities. our portfolio of fixed income securities constituted
71% (at cost) of our property-liability insurance operations investment
portfolio at december31, 2003. the portfolio is primarily composed of
high-quality, intermediate-term taxable u.s. government, corporate and
mortgage-backed bonds, and tax-exempt u.s. municipal bonds. the following table
presents information about the fixed maturity portfolio for the years 2001
through 2003 (dollars in millions).

we participate in a securities lending program whereby
certain securities from our fixed income portfolio are loaned to other
institutions. we require collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of
the loaned securities. we maintain full ownership rights to the securities loaned,
and continue to earn interest on them. in addition, we have the ability to sell
the securities while they are on loan. we have an indemnification agreement
with the lending agents in the event a borrower becomes insolvent or fails to
return securities. we record securities lending collateral as a liability and
pay the borrower an agreed upon interest rate. the proceeds from the collateral
are invested in short-term investments and are reported as securities on loan
on the balance sheet. we share a portion of the interest earned on these
short-term investments with the lending agent. the fair value of the securities
on loan is removed from fixed income securities on the balance sheet and shown
as a separate investment asset.
we manage our bond portfolio conservatively to provide
reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risks. at december31, 2003,
approximately 96% of our fixed income portfolio (comprised of fixed income
securities, the fixed income portion of our securities on loan and short-term investments),
was rated investment grade. approximately 3% consisted of non-investment grade
securities and 1% were non-rated securities.
real
estate and mortgage loans. our real estate
holdings consist of a diversified portfolio of commercial office and warehouse
properties that we own directly or have partial interest in through joint
ventures. the properties are geographically distributed throughout the united
states and had an overall occupancy rate of 89.7% at december31, 2003. we
also have a portfolio of real estate mortgage loans acquired in our merger with
usf&g corporation in 1998. the real estate and mortgage loan portfolio
produced $67 million of pretax investment income in 2003 and generated $4
million of pretax realized gains.
venture
capital. securities of small- to medium-sized
companies spanning a variety of industries comprise our venture capital
holdings, which accounted for 2% of property-liability investments (at cost) at
december31, 2003. the $535 million carrying value of venture capital
investments at december31, 2003 included $24 million of pretax unrealized
appreciation. venture capital investments generated pretax realized investment
gains of$51 million in 2003 and
losses of $200 million in 2002.
in our venture capital portfolio, the sale of a large
portion of one of our investment holdings generated a pretax gain of $171
million in 2003, which was largely offset by impairment realized losses
totaling $143 million related to 38 of our investment holdings. fourteen of
those holdings were impaired due to a merger or sale at a value less than our
cost. eleven holdings experienced fundamental economic deterioration
(characterized by gross margins being less than expected, product pricing not
meeting initial projections due to market conditions, and greater than expected
manufacturing expenses). six holdings were written down because the entities
progress was substantially less than planned and additional financing was
required at values less than our cost. an additional six holdings were impaired
due to cessation of operations of the entity. finally, one holding was impaired
because market demand for its product was less than expected.
in 2002, realized losses in our venture capital
portfolio included $56 million of losses resulting from the sale of the
majority of our partnership investment holdings, and impairment write-downs in
25 of our holdings totaling $122 million. these holdings were impaired for the
same general reasons noted above for the 2003 impairments: seven holdings were
impaired because market demand for their products was less than expected; seven
holdings were written down because the entities progress was less than planned
and additional financing would be required; five holdings were impaired due to
fundamental economic deterioration (as defined above); four holdings were
impaired due to a merger or sale at less than our cost; and two holdings were
impaired due to cessation of operations.
equities. our
equity holdings consist of a diversified portfolio of public common stock,
comprising less than 1% of total property-liability investments (at cost) at
year-end 2003. in mid-2002, we began reducing our equity investments. our
decision to reduce our public equity holdings was prompted by several factors,
including our opinion as to the near-term direction of equity prices, a
comprehensive evaluation of our aggregate equity exposure (including venture
capital and equities held by our pension fund), and a change in our opinion as
to the level of public equity investments that is appropriate for publicly held
insurance companies in light of increasing equity market volatility. by the end
of 2003, we had reduced our equity investments by $953 million (at cost) since
year-end 2001.
short-term
and other investments. our
portfolio also includes short-term securities and other miscellaneous
investments (including our 14% equity ownership stake in platinum and our
warrants to purchase up to six million additional common shares of platinum),
which in the aggregate comprised 15% of property-liability investments at december31,
2003. also included in other investments at december31, 2003 and 2002
was a long-term interest-bearing security from a highly rated entity,
supporting a series of insurance transactions. the carrying value of that
security on those dates was $359 million and $386 million, respectively.
derivatives. our property-liability investment operations have had
limited involvement with derivative financial instruments, primarily for
purposes of hedging against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates. effective january. 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of
statement of financial standards (sfas) no.133, accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities, as amended, which required the
recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on
the balance sheet. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in item
8 of this report, which provides more information regarding the impact of
adopting sfas no.133.
in addition to note 7, see
notes 1, 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of
this report, which provide additional information about our investment
portfolio.
asset management
nuveen investments,inc. (nuveen investments,
formerly the john nuveen company) is our asset management subsidiary. the st.
paul and its largest property-liability insurance subsidiary, fire and marine)
hold a combined 79% interest in nuveen investments.
nuveen investments core businesses are asset
management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and
distribution of investment products and services for the affluent, high net
worth and institutional market segments. nuveen investments distributes its
investment products and services, including individually managed accounts,
closed-end exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, to the affluent and high net
worth market segments through unaffiliated intermediary firms including
broker/dealers, commercial banks, affiliates of insurance providers, financial
planners, accountants, consultants and investment advisors. nuveen investments
also provides managed account services, including privately offered
partnerships, to several institutional market segments and channels.
nuveen investments primary business activities
generate three principal sources of revenue: (1)advisory fees earned on
assets under management, including exchange-traded funds, separately managed
accounts and mutual funds; (2)underwriting and distribution revenues
earned upon the sale of certain investment products and (3)performance
fees earned on certain institutional accounts based on the performance of such
accounts. advisory fees accounted for 90% of nuveen investments total revenues
in 2003.
operations of nuveen investments are organized around
its principle advisory subsidiaries, which are registered investment advisors
under the investment advisors act of 1940:
nuveen advisory corp. (nac) and nuveen institutional advisory corp (niac)
manage various nuveen mutual funds and exchange-traded funds; nuveen asset
management (nam), rittenhouse asset management (rittenhouse), nwq
investment management company, llc (nwq), and symphony asset management (symphony)
principally provide investment management services for individual and
institutional managed accounts.
additionally, nuveen investments, llc, a registered
broker and dealer in securities under the securities exchange act of 1934,
provides investment product distribution and related services for the companys
managed funds and, through marchof 2002, sponsored and distributed the
companys defined portfolios.
at december31, 2003,
nuveen investments assets under management totaled $95.4 billion, consisting
of $47.1 billion of exchange-traded funds, $25.7 billion of retail managed
accounts, $10.3 billion of institutional managed accounts, and $12.3 billion of
mutual funds.
competition
property-liability
insurance
the property-liability insurance industry is highly
competitive in the areas of price, service, product offerings, technology and
agent relationships. ratings issued by independent ratings agencies are also a
competitive factor in the insurance business. increasing the competitive
pressure is the current low interest rate environment that is impacting
investment returns and making underwriting decisions even more critical. our
domestic and international insurance subsidiaries compete with other stock
companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups and other
underwriting organizations. competitors in this market are primarily national
property-liability insurance companies willing to write most classes of
business using traditional products and pricing and, to a lesser extent,
regional insurance companies and companies that have developed niche programs
for specific industry segments. in addition, many large commercial customers self-insure
their risks or utilize large deductibles on purchased insurance. there are
approximately 3,400 property and liability insurance companies in the united
states operating independently or in groups, and no single company or group is
dominant. according toa.m.best, we are the sixth-largest united
states commercial lines property and liability insurance group based on 2002
direct premiums written. some of our competitors are larger and have greater
access to capital. in various markets, we also compete based on ratings and
several of our competitors are more highly rated.
in addition, the financial services industry in
general continues to be affected by an intensifying competitive environment, as
demonstrated by consolidation through mergers and acquisitions and competition
from new entrants, as well as established competitors using new technologies,
including the internet, to establish or expand their businesses. the
gramm-leach-bliley act, passed in 1999, which repealed u.s. laws that separated
commercial banking, investment banking and insurance activities, together with
changes to the industry resulting from previous reforms, has increased the
number of companies competing for a similar customer base.
our competitors in the specialty commercial and
commercial lines segments include american international group, the chubb
corporation, cna financial corporation, hartford insurance group, safeco
corporation and travelers property casualty corp.
our competitors in the surety& construction
segment include cna surety corporation, american international group, travelers
property casualty corp., and zurich north america. in our international and
lloyds segment, our international specialties compete with numerous insurers
in the united kingdom, canada and ireland while competitors in lloyds markets
in which we are active include various insurance companies and other members of
lloyds.
our subsidiaries compete
principally by attempting to offer a combination of superior products,
underwriting expertise and services at a competitive, yet profitable, price. additionally,
our relatively large size and underwriting capacity provide us with
opportunities not available to smaller companies.
asset management
nuveen investments is subject to substantial
competition in all aspects of its business. the registered representatives that
distribute nuveen investments investment products also distribute numerous
competing products, often including products sponsored by the retail
distribution firms where they are employed. there are relatively few barriers
to entry for new investment management firms. nuveen investments managed
account business is also subject to substantial competition from other
investment management firms seeking to be approved as managers in the various wrap-fee
programs. the sponsor firms have a limited number of approved managers at the
highest and most attractive levels of their programs and closely monitor the
investment performance and customer service aspects of such firms on an
on-going basis as they evaluate which firms are eligible for continued
participation in these programs.
nuveen investments is also
subject to competition in obtaining the commitment of underwriters to
underwrite its exchange traded fund offerings. to the extent the increased
competition for underwriting and distribution causes higher distribution costs,
nuveen investments net revenue and earnings will be reduced.
investment products are
sold to the public by broker/dealers, banks, insurance companies and others,
and many competing investment product sponsors offer a broader array of
investment products. many of these institutions have substantially greater
resources than nuveen. in addition, continuing consolidation in the financial
services industry and the recent bear market environment are altering the
landscape in which nuveen investments distributors compete and the economics
of many of the products they offer. the effect that these continuing changes in
the brokerage and investment management industries will have on nuveen
investments and its competitors cannot be predicted. nuveen investments
competes with other providers of products primarily on the basis of the range
of products offered, the investment performance of such products, quality of
service, fees charged, the level and type of broker compensation, the manner in
which such products are marketed and distributed, and the services provided to
registered representatives and investors.
regulation
property-liability insurance
insurance holding company regulation. the
st. paul and our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation as
an insurance holding company system in states where our insurance subsidiaries
are domiciled, which currently include minnesota, maryland, wisconsin,
mississippi, iowa, illinois, california, delaware, indiana, vermont and new
york. such regulation generally provides that transactions between companies
within the holding company system must be fair and equitable. transfers of
assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from
insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies
within the system may be subject to prior notice to, or prior approval by,
state regulatory authorities. such regulations also require the insurance
holding company and each insurance subsidiary to register with the insurance
department in the insurance subsidiarys state of domicile and to furnish
annually financial and other information about the operations of companies
within the holding company system.
payment of dividends. fire and marine is our lead u.s.
property-liability underwriting subsidiary, and its dividend paying capacity is
regulated by the laws of minnesota, its state of domicile. minnesota insurance
law provides that, except in the case of extraordinary dividends or
distributions, all dividends or distributions paid by fire and marine may be
declared or paid only from earned surplus, or unassigned funds, as determined
pursuant to statutory accounting principles. as of december31, 2003, fire
and marines earned surplus was $2.2 billion. fire and marine also must notify
the minnesota insurance regulator of its intent to pay a dividend if the
dividend, together with other dividends or distributions made within the
preceding twelve months, would exceed a specified statutory limit, and may not
pay such dividend until either 30 days after the minnesota insurance regulator
has received notice of it and has not within that period disapproved it, or the
regulator has approved the payment. the current statutory limitation applicable
to minnesota property-liability insurers generally is the greater of:
(1) 10% of such insurers
surplus as regards policyholders as of the december31 next preceding the
date of the proposed dividend or distribution; or
(2) the net income of such
insurer, not including realized investment gains, for the 12-month period
ending the december31 next preceding the date of the proposed dividend or
distribution,
in each case determined
under statutory accounting principles. statutory accounting principles differ
from gaap primarily in relation to deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred
taxes and certain other assets,
and reserve calculation
assumptions. the minnesota insurance regulator is also required to review at
least annually the dividends paid by a minnesota domestic insurer to determine
if the dividends are reasonable based upon (1)the adequacy of surplus as
regards policyholders remaining after the dividend payments and (2)the
quality of the insurers earnings and extent to which the required earnings
include extraordinary items.
other states and foreign jurisdictions have similar
regulations to those of minnesota that affect the ability of our other
insurance subsidiaries, most of which are subsidiaries of fire and marine, to
pay dividends. the laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign
jurisdictions where our other insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are similar,
but not identical, to minnesotas, and may be more restrictive. in addition,
many of our insurance subsidiaries are held by other insurance subsidiaries,
and only indirectly by us. therefore, the ability of these indirectly-held
subsidiaries to pay dividends to their direct parents, and our ability to
receive these dividends from those intermediate subsidiaries, will be subject
to the respective ability of all such subsidiaries to meet financial and
regulatory requirements applicable to them.
approximately $774 million will be available to us
from payment of ordinary dividends by fire and marine in 2004. any dividend payments
beyond the $774 million limitation are subject to prior approval of the
minnesota commissioner of commerce. business and regulatory considerations may
impact the amount of dividends actually paid. in 2003, we received dividends in
the form of cash and securities totaling $625 million from our u.s.
underwriting subsidiaries. we received no cash dividends from our u.s.
property-liability underwriting subsidiaries in 2002. in 2001, we received
dividends in the form of cash and securities of $827 million from fire and
marine.
change
of control. most
states, including the states in which our domestic insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a change of
control of an insurer or an insurers holding company. laws such as these that
apply to us prevent any person from acquiring control of the st. paul or of our
insurance subsidiaries unless that person has filed a statement with specified
information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval.
under most states statutes, acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of an
insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of
control, although such presumption may be rebutted. accordingly, any person who
acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of the st. paul without the prior
approval of the insurance regulators of the states in which our insurance
subsidiaries are domiciled will be in violation of these states laws and may
be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those
securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of
those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance
regulator.
in addition, many state insurance laws require prior
notification of state insurance departments of a change in control of a
non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. while these
pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to
disapprove the change in control, they authorize regulatory action in the
affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market
concentration. any future transactions that would constitute a change in
control of the st. paul may require prior notification in those states that
have adopted pre-acquisition notification laws.
change of control laws may discourage potential
acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of
the st. paul, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited
transactions, that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be
desirable.
state
regulation of insurance operations. our insurance subsidiaries are
subject to licensing and supervision by government regulatory agencies in the
jurisdictions in which they do business. the nature and extent of such
regulation vary but generally have their source in statutes that delegate regulatory,
supervisory and administrative powers to insurance regulators, which in the
u.s. are state authorities. such regulation, supervision and administration of
the insurance subsidiaries may relate, among other things, to
the standards of solvency
which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents;
the nature of and limitations on investments; restrictions on the size of risk
which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the
benefit of policyholders; regulation of policy forms and premium rates;
periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other
reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for
other purposes; requirements regarding reserves for unearned premiums, losses
and other matters; the nature of and limitations on dividends to policyholders
and shareholders; the nature and extent of required participation in insurance
guaranty funds; and the involuntary assumption of hard-to-place or high-risk insurance
business, primarily in workers compensation insurance lines.
loss ratio trends in property-liability insurance
underwriting experience may be improved by, among other things, changing the
kinds of coverages provided by policies, providing loss prevention and risk
management services, increasing premium rates, purchasing reinsurance or by a
combination of these factors. the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to meet
emerging adverse underwriting trends may be delayed, from time to time, by the
effects of laws which require prior approval by insurance regulatory
authorities of changes in policy forms and premium rates. our u.s. underwriting
operations do business in all 50 states and the district of columbia, puerto
rico, guam and the u.s. virgin islands. a number of these jurisdictions require
prior approval of most or all premium rates.
risk-based
capital requirements. in
order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the national association
of insurance commissioners (the naic) has adopted a formula and model law to
implement risk-based capital (rbc) requirements for most property and
casualty insurance companies, which is designed to determine minimum capital
requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus
provides for policyholder obligations. the rbc formula for property and
casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property
and casualty insurers: underwriting, which encompasses the risk of adverse loss
developments and inadequate pricing; declines in asset values arising from
market and/or credit risk; and off-balance sheet risk arising from adverse experience
from non-controlled assets, guarantees for affiliates or other contingent
liabilities and excessive premium growth.
under laws adopted by individual states, insurers
having less total adjusted capital than that required by the rbc calculation
will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level
of capital inadequacy. the rbc ratios for each of our insurance subsidiaries
currently are above the ranges that would require any regulatory or corrective
action.
iris tests. the naic has developed a set
of financial relationships or tests known as the insurance regulatory
information system to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial
condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special
attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. insurance companies
generally submit data annually to the naic, which in turn analyzes the data
using prescribed financial data ratios, each with defined usual ranges. generally, regulators will begin to
investigate or monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the
usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. if an insurance company has
insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it
can issue. we are not aware that any of our insurance companies are currently
subject to regulatory scrutiny based on these ratios.
insurance reserves. state and provincial
insurance laws require us to analyze the adequacy of our reserves annually. our
actuaries must submit an opinion that our reserves, when considered in light of
the assets we hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for
our contractual obligations and related expenses.
shared market and similar arrangements. state insurance laws and regulations
require us to participate in mandatory property-liability shared market, pooling
or similar arrangements that provide insurance coverage to individuals or
others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage
voluntarily provided by private insurers. shared market mechanisms
include assigned risk plans; fair access to insurance requirement or fair
plans; and reinsurance facilities for covering catastrophic risk. in addition,
some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims
that exceed specified amounts. our participation in these mandatory shared
market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amounts of our direct
writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the
applicable state. we cannot predict the financial impact of our participation
in these arrangements.
insurance guaranty association assessments. each state has insurance
guaranty association laws under which life and property and casualty insurers
doing business in the state may be assessed by state insurance guaranty
associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders
and claimants. typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount
related to the member insurers proportionate share of the business written by
all member insurers in the state. for the years ended december31, 2003
and 2002, we incurred net expense of $10 million and $13 million, respectively,
pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. while we cannot predict
the amount and timing of any future assessments on our insurance companies
under these laws, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for
assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to
insolvency proceedings.
federal
regulation of insurance operations. on november26, 2002, president
bush signed into law the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002, or tria. a discussion of trias principal provisions
can be found in the terrorism risk and legislation section of this report.
our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to
tria, although tria does not apply to all of the coverages they write. tria
does apply to most of our coverages written, including property, commercial
multi-peril, fire, ocean marine, inland marine, liability, commercial auto,
aircraft, surety and workers compensation.
international
regulation of insurance operations. our insurance underwriting
operations in the united kingdom are regulated by the financial services
authority (fsa). the fsas principal objectives are to maintain market
confidence, promote public understanding of the financial system, protect consumers,
and to fight financial crime. in canada, the conduct of insurance business is
regulated under provisions of the insurance companies act of 1992, which
requires insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on
the type and amount of insurance policies in force. the lloyds operation is
also regulated by the fsa, which has delegated certain regulatory
responsibilities to the council of lloyds. we are also subject to regulations
in the other countries and jurisdictions in which we underwrite insurance
business. the terms and conditions of our plans to cease underwriting
operations in selected foreign countries were subject to regulatory approval in
several of those countries.
asset management
one of nuveen investments subsidiaries is registered
as a broker/dealer under the securities exchange act of 1934 and is subject to
regulation by the securities and exchange commission (the commission), nasd
regulation,inc. and other federal and state agencies and self-regulatory
organizations. the securities industry is one of the most highly regulated in
the united states, and failure to comply with related laws and regulations can
result in the revocation of broker/dealer licenses, the imposition of censures
or fines, and the suspension or expulsion of a firm and/or its employees from
the securities business.
each of nuveen investments investment adviser
subsidiaries is registered with the commission under the investment advisers
act. virtually all aspects of nuveen investments investment management
business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. these
laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the investment product
holder and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative
powers, including the power to limit or restrict nuveen from carrying on its
investment management business in the event that it fails to comply with such
laws and regulations. in such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed
include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on nuveen
investments engaging in the investment management business for specified
periods of time, the revocation of its advisory subsidiaries registrations as
investment advisers or other censures and fines.
nuveen investments has
responded and continues to respond to various requests and inquiries from
regulatory and governmental officials that are related to recent
well-publicized alleged incidents of inappropriate and illegal trading within
the asset management industry. these incidents could result in increased
regulation of all asset managers, including nuveen investments. such regulation
could have an adverse effect on nuveen investments profitability.
item 2. properties.
fire and marine owns our corporate headquarters
buildings, located at 385 washington street and 130 west sixth street, st.
paul, mn. these buildings are adjacent to one another and consist of
approximately 1.1 million square feet of gross floor space. fire and marine
also owns property in woodbury, mn where its administrative services building
and off-site computer processing operations are located.
we own a building in london, england, which houses a
portion of our u.k. operations. we retained ownership of another building in
london subsequent to the sale of minet holdings plc to aon corporation in 1997,
which is being leased to an outside party. in a transaction completed in march2001,
we sold a 50% interest in this building. in april2003, we completed the
sale of our 68-acre office campus in baltimore, md that we acquired as part of
our merger with usf&g corporation in 1998. as part of the sale agreement,
we agreed to lease a portion of the office space on the campus until september2004.
in august2003, we sold a parking ramp we owned in downtown st. paul, mn
for total proceeds of approximately $5 million.
fire and marine and its subsidiary, st. paul
properties,inc., own a portfolio of income-producing properties in
various locations across the united states that they have purchased for
investment. included in this portfolio are four office buildings in which we
hold a 50% ownership interest located on manhattan island in new york, ny which
collectively accounted for approximately 7% of the carrying value of the
property portfolio at december31, 2003.
our operating subsidiaries rent or lease office space
in most cities in which they operate.
management considers the
currently owned and leased office facilities of the st. paul and its
subsidiaries adequate for the current and anticipated future level of
operations.
item 3. legal proceedings.
legal mattersin the ordinary
course of conducting business, we (and certain of our subsidiaries) have been
named as defendants in various lawsuits. some of these lawsuits attempt to
establish liability under insurance contracts issued by our underwriting
operations, including liability under environmental
protection laws and for injury caused by exposure to asbestos products. plaintiffs
in these lawsuits are seeking money damages that in some cases are substantial
or extra contractual in nature or are seeking to have the court direct the
activities of our operations in certain ways.
although the ultimate outcome of these matters is not
presently determinable, it is possible that the resolution of one or more
matters may be material to our results of operations; however, we do not believe
that the total amounts that we and our subsidiaries will ultimately have to pay
in all of these lawsuits will have a material effect on our liquidity or
overall financial position.
the following is a
summary of certain litigation matters with contingencies:
asbestos settlement agreementon june3, 2002, we announced
that we and certain of our subsidiaries had entered into an agreement settling
all existing and future claims arising from any insuring relationship of united
states fidelity and guaranty company, st. paul fire and marine insurance
company and their affiliates and subsidiaries, including us, with any of
macarthur company, western macarthur company, and western asbestos company. in january2004,
the u.s. bankruptcy court for the northern district of california issued an
order approving the settlement agreement and confirming the macarthur companies
proposed plan of reorganization. see further discussion in note 20 to the
consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report. in the first quarter of 2003, we made a
payment of $747 million, (which included $7 million interest), related to the
western macarthur settlement agreement. that amount, along with $60 million of
an initial $235 million payment made in the second quarter of 2002, is being
held in escrow pending final confirmation of the bankruptcy court approval of
the settlement agreement and the macarthur companies plan of reorganization. accordingly,
as of december31, 2003, these payments were recorded in the amounts of
$807 million in both other assets and other liabilities.
petrobras oil rig constructionin september2002, the united
states district court for the southern district of new york entered a judgment
in the amount of approximately $370 million to petrobras, an energy company
that is majority-owned by the government of brazil, in a claim related to the
construction of two oil rigs. one of our subsidiaries provided a portion of the
surety coverage for that construction. as a result, we recorded a pretax loss
of $34 million ($22 million after-tax) in 2002 in our surety&
construction business segment. the loss recorded was net of reinsurance and
previously established case reserves for this exposure, and prior to any
possible recoveries related to indemnity. we continue to actively pursue an
appeal of this judgment.
purported classaction shareholder lawsuitsin the fourth quarter of 2002,
several purported class action lawsuits were filed against our chief executive
officer, our chief financial officer, and us. in the first quarter of 2003, the
lawsuits were consolidated into a single action, which makes various
allegations relating to the adequacy of our previous public disclosures and
reserves relating to the western macarthur asbestos litigation, and seeks
unspecified damages and other relief. in the fourth quarter of 2003, we agreed
in principle to a settlement, which is subject to certain customary conditions
and subject to court approval. if the settlement is consummated, it will result
in our payment of an amount that is not material to our results of operations.
boson v. union carbide
corp., et al; abernathy v. ace american ins. coin 2003, lawsuits were filed in
texas and ohio against certain of our subsidiaries, and other insurers and
non-insurer corporate defendants, asserting liability for failing to warn of
the dangers of asbestos. it is difficult to predict the outcome for financial
exposure represented by this type of litigation in light of the broad nature of
the relief requested and the novel theories asserted. we believe, however, that
the cases are without merit and we intend to contest them vigorously. in this
regard, we filed special exceptions in all of the texas cases. in october2003,
a court ruled on the special exceptions in 11 of those cases, dismissing the
cases with prejudice. subsequently, the court dismissed another case on the
same grounds. we view these as significant rulings in our favor. the special
exceptions in the remaining 50 cases have not yet been ruled upon. we intend to
file similar motions to dismiss in the ohio cases.
world trade center litigationin 2002, we and certain other
insurers obtained a summary judgment ruling that the world trade center (wtc)
property loss on september11, 2001 was a single occurrence. certain
insureds, including the wtcs leaseholder, appealed that ruling, asking the
court to determine that the property loss constituted two separate occurrences
rather than one. in september2003, the u.s. circuit court of appeals for
the second circuit ruled that under terms of the policy form we used to
underwrite property coverage for the wtc, the terrorist attack constituted one
occurrence.
farina v. travelers property casualty corp., et ala purported class action was
recently filed in connecticut state court against travelers property casualty
corp. and its board of directors alleging that they breached their fiduciary
duties to travelers shareholders in connection with the adoption of the merger
and the merger agreement with the company. the complaint seeks injunctive
relief as well as unspecified monetary damages. the complaint also names the
company and its subsidiary, adams acquisition corp., as defendants, alleging
that they aided and abetted the alleged breach of fiduciary duty. we believe this
suit is wholly without merit and intend to vigorously defend against it.
in 1990, at the direction
of the uk department of trade and industry (dti), five insurance underwriting
subsidiaries of london united investments plc (lui) suspended underwriting new
insurance business. at the same time, four of those subsidiaries, being
insolvent, suspended payment of claims and have since been placed in
provisional liquidation. the fifth subsidiary, walbrook insurance company,
continued paying claims until mayof 1992 when it was also placed in
provisional insolvent liquidation. weavers underwriting agency (weavers), an
lui subsidiary, managed these insurers. minet, a former insurance brokerage
subsidiary of ours, had brokered business to and from weavers for many years. from
1973 through 1980, our uk-based underwriting operations, now called st. paul
international insurance company ltd. (spi), had accepted business from weavers.
a portion of that business was ceded by spi to reinsurers. certain of those
reinsurers have challenged the validity of certain reinsurance contracts (or
the amount of recovery thereunder) relating to the weavers pool, of which spi
was a member, in an attempt to avoid liability under those contracts. spi and
other members of the weavers pool are seeking enforcement of the reinsurance
contracts. minet may also become the subject of legal proceedings arising from
its role as one of the major brokers for weavers. when we sold minet in may1997,
we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for most of minets then existing
liabilities, including liabilities relating to the weavers matter. we will
vigorously contest any proceedings relating to the weavers matter. we recognize
that the final outcome of these proceedings, if adverse to us, may materially
impact the results of operations in the period in which that outcome occurs. we
believe that such an adverse outcome, however, will not have a materially
adverse effect on our liquidity or overall financial position.

companies, inc. and subsidiaries
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations
december31, 2003
the st. paul companies,inc.
(the st. paul or the company) is incorporated as a general business
corporation under the laws of the state of minnesota. the st. paul and its subsidiaries
constitute one of the oldest insurance organizations in the united states,
dating back to 1853. we are a management company principally engaged, through
our subsidiaries, in providing commercial property-liability insurance products
and services. we also have a presence in the asset management industry through
our 79% majority ownership of nuveen investments,inc. as a management
company, we oversee the operations of our subsidiaries and provide them with
capital, management and administrative services. our internet website address
is stpaul.com. we make available, free of
charge, on or through our website, annual reports on form10-k, quarterly
reports on form10-q and current reports on form8-k and amendments
to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section13(a)or 15(d)of
the securities exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the securities and
exchange commission. our website address is an inactive textual reference only
and the contents of the website are not part of this report.
overview
the company
generates its return on capital primarily by taking in premiums, net of the
expenses to generate those premiums as well as other expenses, and investing
them, predominantly in fixed income securities, until the company pays out
losses related to the insurance coverage provided. the primary factors
impacting returns which are monitored regularly by the company include:
the
adequacy of premiums charged relative to the risks assumed;
investment
returns on the premium cash flows;
efficiency
of the companys operations and ability of management to control expenses; and
the
amount and timing of paid losses.
adequacy of
premiums
the company experienced
its fifth consecutive year of generally increasing prices in 2003. these
increases exceeded increases in our estimated loss trends, resulting in
improved margins and cash flow. average price increases during 2003 were 20% in
our specialty commercial segment and 11% in our commercial lines segment. while
the overall absolute level of price increases in 2003 slowed from 2002 levels,
we expect overall price increases in 2004 to continue to exceed overall
increases in estimated loss trends. however, the property and casualty
insurance industry has historically been highly cyclical, and price competition
in the years leading up to 1999 generally resulted in declining profitability
in the industry. the company has implemented internal management reporting to
monitor pricing and profitability, allowing the company to take actions to
maximize profitability as pricing or premium adequacy trends change.
investment returns
investment returns are a major component of the
companys revenue and profitability. at december31, 2003, nearly 90% of
the companys investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities,
securities on loan and short-term investments. lower rates of return on new
money invested in recent years have required higher premium levels to generate
the same returns on capital. the company believes that decreasing interest
rates since the beginning of 2000 have been one of the factors causing
property-liability insurance prices to increase. likewise, increases in new
money investment rates will increase investment income, but may result in
increased price competition in the industry as companies could generate the
same return on equity at lower premium levels. however, if new money investment
rates increase, the value of our fixed income portfolio will decrease.
during 2003, the companys average new money
investment rate was 4.5% for taxable bonds and 3.1% for tax-exempts, which
reduced the average imbedded pre-tax yield in our long-term fixed income
portfolio to 5.7% at december31, 2003, down from 6.2% a year earlier.
the companys fixed income
portfolio maintains a very high credit quality with an average rating at aa+
and a relatively short duration of 3.8 years which mitigates the risks of
increasing interest rates and widening credit spreads. during 2003, duration
lengthened slightly, from 3.3 years.
efficiency of the
operations
the property-liability
industry generally measures expenses as a percentage of written premiums, a
component of revenue. management uses a variety of measures, including the
statutory expense ratio, to evaluate its success in controlling expenses. expenses
consist of variable components, such as taxes, fees and commissions that are
calculated as a percentage of premium, and fixed components such as salaries,
benefits, rent and system costs. the statutory expense ratio for the year ended
december31, 2003 was 29.1, an improvement over the comparable 2002
statutory expense ratio of 29.7. while the company experienced increases in
variable costs in the second half of 2003 as premiums grew, the statutory
expense ratio declined. a significant portion of the increase in premiums was
driven by price increases and not unit or policy increases, and generally did
not require commensurate increases in fixed expenses to manage the business. significant
decreases in premiums written in our runoff businesses, combined with
continuing expenses to manage those businesses, prevented further improvement
in our consolidated expense ratio in 2003. we expect to manage our business in
2004 with a general objective of keeping expenses level, except for variable
expenses that vary with premium production, such as premium taxes and
commissions.
accordingly,
absent unfavorable developments in the pricing environment, we expect our
statutory expense ratio to generally remain stable or improve in 2004.
the amount and
timing of paid losses
management estimates the
amount it expects to pay claimants for insured losses and the cost of
investigating, resolving and processing those claims. given the inherent
uncertainty in the reserving process and that many of the coverages we offer
involve claims that may not ultimately be settled for many years after they are
incurred, our estimates may be materially different from the amounts we
ultimately pay or incur with respect to insured losses. if our estimates
change, we make adjustments to our reserves and these adjustments are reflected
in our income statements for the current period. one measure management uses to
assess our profitability is our statutory combined ratio, which reflects the
sum of the statutory loss ratio (incurred losses as a percentage of earned
premium) and the statutory expense ratio described above. our loss ratio
improved from 79.9 in 2002 to 73.4 in 2003. over the past two years, increasing
pricing has significantly improved the combined ratio in our ongoing segments,
which dropped from 108.6 in 2001 to 95.8 in 2002 and 91.7 in 2003.
proposed merger
with travelers
management believes that
the proposed merger with travelers property casualty corp., announced on november17,
2003, will be a transforming event for the st. paul. management believes that
the proposed merger will create a premier property and casualty insurance
company that will be well positioned for long-term success and the creation of
superior shareholder value in the highly competitive property and casualty
insurance industry. management believes that the combined company will have
significant product breadth and geographic reach and will be uniquely
positioned as the property casualty insurer of choice for agents, brokers and
customers across the united states. management believes that the st. paul will
benefit from the combined financial resources, management and personnel of the
two companies and will be better able to capitalize on opportunities in the
insurance industry. in addition, management believes that the proposed merger
will permit the st. paul to derive significant advantages from the more
efficient utilization of the assets, management and personnel of two companies.
these significant opportunities do not come without risks. in particular, it
will be a significant challenge to integrate the businesses of the st. paul and
travelers in an efficient and effective manner. furthermore, since the risks
and uncertainties facing each of the st. paul and travelers differ, the results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the combined company may be
affected by risks and uncertainties different from those currently effecting
each of the st. paul and travelers on a stand-alone basis. we currently expect
the proposed merger to close in the second quarter of 2004.

our pretax income from continuing operations of $836
million in 2003 was significantly higher than the 2002 total of $176 million,
due to strong improvement in results produced by our ongoing property-liability
underwriting segments. our 2003 result included a total of $646 million in
pretax loss provisions to strengthen prior-year loss reserves, of which $350
million was recorded in our runoff health care operation and $260 million was
recorded in our other runoff operations. our majority-owned asset management
subsidiary, nuveen investments,inc., achieved its ninth consecutive year
of record results in 2003, driven by a significant increase in assets under
management. in 2002, our pretax results included a $472 million loss provision,
net of reinsurance, related to a settlement agreement we entered into with
respect to the western macarthur asbestos litigation (described in more detail
later in this discussion). our pretax loss of $1.43 billion in 2001 was
dominated by $941 million of pretax losses resulting from the september11,
2001 terrorist attack and pretax provisions totaling $735 million to strengthen
prior-year loss reserves in our health care business center. the 2003 and 2002
pretax losses in the parent company and other operations category (which
primarily consists of management, administrative and debt service expenses at
the holding company level) were significantly higher than comparable loss in
2001 primarily due to an increase in distributions related to preferred
securities issued in the fourth quarter of 2001.
our effective tax rate on pretax earnings was 16% in
2003, primarily reflecting the benefit of investment income from tax-exempt
fixed income securities in our property-liability investment operations segment.
in 2002, our income tax benefit of $73 million on pretax income of $176 million
included $124 million of tax benefits associated with net realized investment
losses. that $124 million reflected a $207 million benefit related to the sale
of certain of our international operations and all other net realized gains and
losses, and $83 million of tax expense related to the transfer of our ongoing
reinsurance operations (discussed in more detail later in this discussion). in
2002, we substantially completed the refocusing of our international
property-liability underwriting operations. as part of that effort, we sold
certain of those operations in the fourth quarter of 2002, resulting in a net
after-tax realized gain of $132 million that was predominantly comprised of the
aforementioned tax benefits. the pretax impact on our results in 2002 from
those sales was nominal, as significant operating losses had previously been
reflected in our reported results for these operations prior to their
divestiture.
as a result of
implementing the provisions of a new accounting pronouncement in 2002
(discussed in more detail later in this discussion), we did not record any
goodwill amortization expense in 2003 or 2002. in 2001, expenses related to
goodwill totaled $114 million, which included $73 million of goodwill
write-downs related to businesses we decided to exit. amortization expense
related to other intangible assets totaled $31 million in 2003, compared with
$18 million in 2002 and $2 million in 2001.

2003 vs. 2002the 6% decline in insurance premiums
earned in 2003 was centered in our runoff other segment, reflecting the impact
of our decision to withdraw from lines of business included in that segment. in
our ongoing property-liability underwriting segments, earned premiums of $6.71
billion were 22% higher than comparable 2002 earned premiums of $5.52 billion,
due to a combination of new business, higher business retention levels and
price increases. the $49 million decline in net investment income in 2003 was
primarily due to a decline in investment yields on new investments, and a
reduced amount of invested assets during 2003 resulting from the first-quarter
payment of $747 million related to the western macarthur asbestos litigation
settlement agreement. asset management revenues grew 14% over 2002, driven by a
significant increase in investment advisory fees resulting from a $15.6 billion
increase in assets under management. realized investment gains in 2003 were
driven by sales of certain venture capital and equity holdings. the increase in
other revenues in 2003 over 2002 was largely due to foreign currency exchange
gains.
2002 vs. 2001earned
premiums in 2002 grew 1% over 2001, as the positive impacts of significant
price increases in 2001 and 2002 and new business in many of our ongoing
operations were largely offset by our withdrawal from several lines of business
and the transfer of our ongoing reinsurance operations to platinum. earned
premiums of $5.52 billion generated by our two ongoing property-liability
underwriting segments in 2002 grew 24% over comparable 2001 earned premiums of
$4.44 billion, whereas earned premiums produced by our runoff segment in 2002
declined 33% compared with 2001. net investment income declined 4% from 2001,
primarily due to reduced yields on new investments. realized investment losses
in 2002 were concentrated in our venture capital and equity portfolios and
included losses originating from sales of investments, as well as impairment
write-downs. the majority of our other revenues consisted of risk management
consulting fees and claim servicing fees in our insurance underwriting
operations and foreign exchange gains and losses.
revisions to
business segment reporting structure
in the first
quarter of 2003, we revised our property-liability insurance business segment
reporting structure to reflect the manner in which those businesses are managed.
our property-liability underwriting operations consist of two segments
constituting our ongoing operations (specialty
commercial and
commercial lines), and one segment
comprising our runoff operations (other).
the composition of those respective segments is described in greater detail in
the analysis of their results later in this discussion. the following is a
summary of changes made to our segments in the first quarter of 2003.
our
surety& construction operations, previously reported together as a
separate specialty segment, are now separate components of our specialty commercial segment.
our
ongoing international operations and our ongoing operations at lloyds,
previously reported together as a separate specialty segment, are now separate
components of our specialty commercial
segment.
our
health care, reinsurance and other operations, each previously reported as a
separate runoff business segment, have been combined into a single other runoff segment and are under common
management. runoff means that we have ceased or plan to cease underwriting
business as soon as possible.
the
results of our participation in voluntary insurance pools, as well as loss
development on business underwritten prior to 1980 (prior to 1988 for business
acquired in our merger with usf&g corporation in 1998), previously included
in our commercial lines segment,
are now included in the other segment.
in addition to our participation in voluntary insurance pools, this prior year
business included the majority of our environmental and asbestos liability
exposures. the oversight of these exposures is the responsibility of the same
management team responsible for oversight of the other components of the other segment.
in addition, in the fourth quarter of 2003, our specialty programs business center,
previously reported in our specialty commercial segment, was moved to our
commercial lines segment to more accurately reflect the manner in which this
business is underwritten and managed. see the commercial lines segment
discussion below for a further description of the specialty programs business center. all data for 2002 and
2001 included in this report were restated to be consistent with the changes
made to our segment reporting structure in the first and fourth quarters of
2003.
in accordance with provisions of sfas no.131, disclosures
about segments of an enterprise and related information, since surety&
construction, international& lloyds, health care, and reinsurance
were reported as separate segments during 2002 and are considered to be of
continuing significance in analyzing the results of our operations, we continue
to separately present and discuss (as appropriate) in note 3 to our
consolidated financial statements and in managements discussion and analysis,
information about those businesses in 2003 and the corresponding periods of
2002 and 2001.
our operations in runoff do not qualify as discontinued
operations for accounting purposes. for the year ended december31, 2003,
these runoff operations collectively accounted for $327 million, or 5%, of our
net earned premiums, and generated underwriting losses totaling $762 million
(an amount that does not include investment income from the assets maintained
to support these operations). for the year ended december31, 2002, these
runoff operations collectively accounted for $1.98 billion, or 26%, of our net
earned premiums, and generated underwriting losses totaling $874 million, an
amount that included a $585 million pretax loss provision related to the
western macarthur asbestos litigation settlement agreement. for the year ended december31,
2001, these runoff operations collectively accounted for $2.97 billion, or 40%,
of our net earned premiums, and generated underwriting losses totaling $1.87
billion, an amount that included a $735 million pretax loss provision to
strengthen prior-year loss reserves in our health care operation and $662
million of pretax losses related to the september11, 2001 terrorist
attack.
our consolidated net loss
and loss adjustment expense reserves of $13.3 billion at december31, 2003
and $14.8 billion at december31, 2002 included approximately $5.6 billion
and $8.0 billion, respectively, of net reserves related to our runoff segment. the
payment of claims from these reserves will negatively impact our investment
income in future periods as the invested assets related to these reserves
decline.
transfer of ongoing
reinsurance operations to platinum underwriters holdings, ltd.
on november1, 2002, we completed the transfer of
our continuing reinsurance business (previously operating under the name st.
paul re) and certain related assets, including renewal rights, to platinum
underwriters holdings, ltd. (platinum), a bermuda company formed in 2002 that
underwrites property and casualty reinsurance on a worldwide basis.
as part of this transaction, we contributed $122
million of cash to platinum and transferred $349 million in assets relating to
the insurance reserves that we also transferred. in exchange, we acquired six
million common shares, representing a 14% equity ownership interest in
platinum, and a ten-year option to buy up to six million additional common
shares at an exercise price of $27 per share, which represents 120% of the
initial public offering price of platinums shares.
in conjunction with the transfer of our continuing
reinsurance business to platinum, we entered into various agreements with
platinum and its subsidiaries, including quota share reinsurance agreements by
which platinum reinsured substantially all of the reinsurance contracts entered
into by st. paul re on or after january1, 2002. this transfer (based on september30,
2002 balances) included $125 million of unearned premium reserves (net of
ceding commissions), $200 million of existing loss and loss adjustment expense
reserves and $24 million of other reinsurance-related liabilities. the transfer
of unearned premium reserves to platinum was accounted for as prospective
reinsurance, while the transfer of existing loss and loss adjustment expense
reserves was accounted for as retroactive reinsurance.
as noted above, the transfer of reserves to platinum
at the inception of the quota share reinsurance agreements was based on the september30,
2002 balances. in march2003, we transferred to platinum $137 million of
additional insurance reserves, consisting of $72 million in unearned premiums
(net of ceding commissions) and $65 million in existing reserves for losses and
loss adjustment expenses. we also transferred cash and other assets having a
value equal to the additional insurance reserves transferred. this transfer of
additional assets and liabilities reflected business activity between september30,
2002 and the november2, 2002 inception date of the quota share
reinsurance agreements, and our estimate of amounts due under the adjustment
provisions of the quota share reinsurance agreements. our insurance reserves at
december31, 2002 included our estimate, at that time, of amounts due to
platinum under the quota share reinsurance agreements, which totaled $54
million. the $83 million increase in our estimate of amounts due to platinum
under the quota share reinsurance agreements resulted in a pretax underwriting
loss of $6 million in the first quarter of 2003. during the second quarter of
2003, we reached final agreement with platinum regarding the adjustment
provisions of the quota share reinsurance agreements and no further adjustments
to the transferred assets and liabilities will occur.
for business underwritten in the united states and the
united kingdom, until october31, 2003 platinum had the right to
underwrite specified reinsurance business on our behalf in cases where platinum
was unable to underwrite that business because it had yet to obtain necessary
regulatory licenses or approval to do so, or platinum had not yet been approved
as a reinsurer by the ceding company. we entered into this agreement solely as
a means to accommodate platinum through a transition period. any business
written by platinum on our policy forms during this transition period was fully
ceded to platinum under the quota share reinsurance agreements.
the transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $29
million and an after-tax loss of $54 million in the year ended december31,
2002. the after-tax loss was driven by the write-off of approximately $73
million in deferred tax assets associated with previously incurred losses
related to st. paul res united kingdom-based operations, as well as approximately
$10 million in taxes associated with the pretax gain.
our investment in platinum
is included in other investments. the
estimated income from our 14% proportionate equity ownership in platinum is
included in our statement of operations as a component of
net
investment income. our option to
purchase additional platinum shares is carried at market value ($65 million and
$61 million at december31, 2003 and 2002, respectively), with changes in
its fair value recorded as other realized gains or losses in our statement of
operations. in 2003 and 2002, we recorded net pretax realized gains of $4
million and $7 million, respectively, related to this option.
acquisitions and
divestitures
in december2003, we completed the sale of
camperdown uk limited, one of our lloyds corporate names and the vehicle for
our participation on the 2003 and prior years of account, to foltus investments
limited. we recognized a $2 million pretax gain on this transaction. at lloyds,
we underwrite business through a single syndicate (syndicate 5000) for which
we provide 100% of the capital. in 2003, fire and marine entered into a 100%
quota share reinsurance agreement directly with syndicate 5000 that in effect
transferred syndicate 5000s underwriting results for the 2003 year of account
to fire and marine. in order to continue our ongoing operations at lloyds, we
activated two corporate names that will be used for 2004 and future years of
account to underwrite syndicate 5000 business.
in november2003, the st. paul and travelers
property casualty corp. announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement.
see item 1 in this report for further discussion of the proposed merger.
in october2003, we sold our subsidiary, octagon
risk services,inc., a claim management and consulting services company,
for proceeds of approximately $30 million. we recorded a pretax gain of $5
million on the sale.
in the third quarter of 2003, we sold our subsidiary
botswana insurance company ltd. for total proceeds of $11 million, and recorded
a pretax loss of less than $1 million.
in may2003, we purchased the right to seek
renewal of several lines of insurance business previously underwritten by
kemper insurance companies. the initial payment for this right was recorded as
an intangible asset (characterized as renewal rights) and is being amortized on
an accelerated basis over four years. the portfolio of business involved in
this transaction included the following lines: technology, small commercial,
middle market commercial, inland and ocean marine, and architects and
engineers professional liability. we did not assume any past liabilities with
this purchase; however, we may be obligated to make an additional payment in june2004
based on the amount of premium volume we ultimately renew during the twelve
month period subsequent to this purchase. we believe it is unlikely that any
additional payment would exceed $30 million. at december31, 2003, we had
accrued $10 million toward this additional obligation, recorded in other
liabilities. our consolidated gross
written premiums for the year ended december31, 2003 included
approximately $280 million attributable to business underwritten as a result of
this purchase of renewal rights, the majority of which were included in our
commercial lines segment.
in december2002, we acquired the right to seek
to renew the professional and financial risk practice business previously
underwritten by royal& sunalliance in the united states, without
assuming past liabilities. that business generated approximately $80 million in
written premiums in 2003. the nominal cost of this acquisition was accounted
for as an intangible asset and is being amortized over four years.
in december2002, we sold our insurance
operations in spain and argentina and all of our operations in mexico except
our surety business. proceeds from these sales totaled $29 million, and we
recorded a pretax gain of $4 million related to the sales.
in march2002, we completed our acquisition of
london guarantee insurance company (london guarantee, now operating under the
name st. paul guarantee), a specialty property-liability insurance company
focused on providing surety products and management liability, bond, and
professional indemnity products. the total cost of the acquisition was
approximately $80 million, of which approximately $18
million represented
goodwill and $37 million represented other intangible assets. the purchase
price was funded through internally generated funds.
in december2001, we purchased the right to seek
to renew surety bond business previously underwritten by firemans fund
insurance company (firemans fund), without assuming past liabilities. we
paid firemans fund $10 million in consideration, which we recorded as an
intangible asset and which we expect to amortize over nine years. based on the
volume of business renewed during 2002, we made a modest additional payment to
firemans fund in the first quarter of 2003. that amount was also recorded as
an intangible asset and is being amortized on an accelerated basis over the
remaining life of the intangible asset.
in january2001, we acquired the right to seek to
renew a book of municipality insurance business from penco, a program
administrator for willis north america inc., for a total consideration of $3.5
million. the cost was recorded as an intangible asset and is being amortized
over five years.
in addition, nuveen
investments made strategic acquisitions in both 2002 and 2001, which are
discussed in greater detail in the asset management section of this
discussion.
discontinued
operations
life insurancein september2001, we completed
the sale of our life insurance company, fidelity and guaranty life insurance
company and its subsidiary, thomas jefferson life (together, f&g life) to
old mutual plc (old mutual), for $335 million in cash and $300 million in
ordinary shares of old mutual. in june2002, we sold all of the old mutual
shares we were holding for a total net consideration of $287 million, resulting
in a pretax realized loss of $13 million that was recorded as a component of
discontinued operations on our statement of operations in 2002. at the time of
the sale of the old mutual shares, there was a derivative collar agreement in
place that would have determined any possible adjustment to the original
f&g life sale price one year after the closing date. the collar was recorded on our balance sheet
as an asset and had a fair value of $12 million when we sold our old mutual
shares. we agreed to terminate the collar at no value as part of the sale of
our old mutual shares. that $12 million pretax loss was also included in
discontinued operations on our statement of operations in 2002.
at the time of the sale of f&g life in 2001, we
recorded a net after-tax loss of $74 million on the sale proceeds. that loss
was combined with f&g lifes results of operations prior to sale for an
after-tax loss of $55 million and was included in the reported loss from
discontinued operations for the year ended december31, 2001.
standard personal insurancein 1999, we sold our
standard personal insurance operations to metropolitan property and casualty
insurance company (metropolitan). metropolitan purchased economy fire&
casualty company and subsidiaries (economy), and the rights and interests in
those non-economy policies constituting the remainder of our standard personal
insurance operations. those rights and interests were transferred to
metropolitan by way of a reinsurance and facility agreement. we guaranteed the
adequacy of economys loss and loss expense reserves, and we remain liable for
claims on non-economy policies that result from losses occurring prior to the september30,
1999 closing date. under the reserve-related agreements, we agreed to pay for
any deficiencies in those reserves and would share in any redundancies that
developed by september30, 2002. any losses incurred by us under these
agreements were reflected in discontinued operations in the period during which
they were incurred. at december31, 2002, our analysis indicated that we
owed metropolitan $13 million related to the reserve agreements, which was paid
in april2003. we have no other contingent liabilities related to this
sale.
nonstandard auto insurancein 1999, prudential
purchased our nonstandard auto insurance business marketed under the victoria
financial and titan auto brands for $175 million in cash (net of a $25 million
dividend paid by these operations to our property-liability insurance
operations prior to closing). we recorded an estimated after-tax loss of $83
million on the sale, representing the estimated excess of carrying value of
these entities at closing date over proceeds to be received from the sale, plus
estimated income through the disposal date. this excess primarily consisted of
goodwill. we recorded an after-tax loss on disposal of $9 million in 2000,
primarily representing additional losses incurred through the disposal date in
may, and an additional after-tax loss on disposal of $5 million in 2001,
primarily representing tax adjustments made to the sale transaction.
minetin 1997, we sold our insurance brokerage
operation, minet holdings plc (minet) to aon corporation. we recorded
expenses in discontinued operations in each of the last three years related to
the minet sale. in 2003, we recorded expense primarily related to an adjustment
to the tax provision on the sale, whereas the expenses recorded in 2002 and
2001 primarily represented additional funds due aon pursuant to provisions of
the sale agreement.
our operations in runoff do not qualify as discontinued
operations for accounting purposes.

asbestos settlement
agreement
on june3, 2002, we announced that we and certain
of our subsidiaries had entered into an agreement settling all existing and
future claims arising from any insuring relationship of united states fidelity
and guaranty company (usf&g), st. paul fire and marine insurance company
and their affiliates and subsidiaries, including us (collectively, the usf&g
parties) with any of macarthur company, western macarthur company (western
macarthur), and western asbestos company (western asbestos) (together, the macarthur
companies).
pursuant to the provisions of the settlement
agreement, on november22, 2002, the macarthur companies filed voluntary
petitions under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code to permit the channeling of
all current and future asbestos-related claims solely to a trust to be
established pursuant to section524(g)of the bankruptcy code. consummation
of most elements of the settlement agreement was contingent upon bankruptcy
court approval of the settlement agreement as part of a broader plan for the
reorganization of the macarthur companies (the plan). in january2004,
the u.s. bankruptcy court for the northern district of california issued an
order approving the settlement agreement with the macarthur companies and
confirming the macarthur companies proposed plan of reorganization. we are awaiting final confirmation of the
bankruptcy court order.
the plan of reorganization includes an injunction in
favor of the st. paul against any direct or indirect liability for
asbestos-related claims against the macarthur companies. under the injunction,
all current and future asbestos-related claims of the macarthur companies will
be channeled to, and paid solely from, the trust established by the plan. the
macarthur companies will release the usf&g parties from any and all asbestos-related
claims for personal injury, and all other claims in excess of $1 million in the
aggregate, that may be asserted relating to or arising from, directly or
indirectly, any alleged coverage provided by any of the usf&g parties to
any of the macarthur companies, including any claim for extra contractual
relief.
the st. paul has completed its funding obligations
under the 2002 settlement agreement, consisting of payments of $235 million
during the second quarter of 2002, and $747 million on january16, 2003
(including interest). following final confirmation of the bankruptcy court
ruling, the escrowed funds will be released to the trust established by the
plan for the payment of the macarthur companies asbestos related claims. the
settlement agreement also provided for the usf&g parties to pay $13 million
(which was paid in the second quarter of 2002) and to advance certain fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the settlement, bankruptcy proceedings,
finalization of the plan and efforts to achieve approval of the plan, subject
to a right of reimbursement in certain circumstances of amounts advanced. up to $175 million of the initial $235 million
payment will be paid to counsel for the macarthur companies, and persons
holding judgments against the macarthur companies as of june3, 2002 and
their counsel, and the usf&g parties will be released from claims by such
holders to the extent of $110 million paid to such holders. at least $60
million from the initial payment and the $747 million paid in 2003 would be
returned to us if final confirmation of the bankruptcy court ruling does not
occur. at december31, 2003, those payments of $807 million were recorded
in both other assets and other liabilities.

fees recoverable from others). on january16, 2003, pursuant to the terms
of the settlement agreement, we paid the remaining $740 million settlement
amount, plus interest, to the bankruptcy trustee in respect of this matter. as
a result, at december31, 2003 our gross asbestos reserves included no
amount related to western macarthur.
(see further discussion of
asbestos reserves in the environmental and asbestos claims section of this
discussion).
possible asbestos
legislation
from time to time asbestos
reform bills have been introduced in the u.s. congress. some of these proposed
laws seek to reduce or eliminate current personal injury litigation by
replacing it with a statutory compensation program funded by contributions from
a variety of sources which may include companies that formerly manufactured,
distributed or sold asbestos products and insurers that underwrote certain
asbestos risks. many of these reform efforts would not cover asbestos property
damage claims and other categories of asbestos exposure including future
personal injury claims if the compensation fund ultimately proves insufficient.
the prospects for the passage of an asbestos reform bill remain uncertain and
the effect of any such future asbestos legislative reform on us would depend
upon a variety of factors including the total size of any compensation fund,
the portions allocated to various commercial groups and the formula for
allocating contributions among insurers. if any asbestos litigation reform is
enacted in the future, our contribution allocation could be significantly
larger than our current asbestos reserve.

in
2001, we recorded estimated net pretax losses totaling $941 million related to

our estimate of losses was
based on a variety of actuarial techniques, coverage interpretation and claims

estimate of losses was originally based on our belief that property-liability
insurance losses from the terrorist attack will total between $30 billion and
$35 billion for the insurance industry. in 2003 and 2002, our estimate of
ultimate losses was supplemented by our ongoing analysis of both paid and
reported claims related to the attack. our estimate of losses remains subject
to significant uncertainties and may change over time as additional information
becomes available.
we regularly evaluate the
adequacy of our estimated net losses related to the terrorist attack, weighing
all factors that may impact the total net losses we will ultimately incur. based
on the results of those regular evaluations, we changed our estimate of losses
among our property-liability segments in 2003 and 2002. in addition, in 2003 we
recorded a reduction of $46 million in estimated losses related to the attack. in
2002, we recorded an additional loss provision of $20 million and a $33 million
reduction in our estimated provision for uncollectible reinsurance related to
the attack.
in 2002, we and other
insurers obtained a summary judgment ruling that the world trade center
property loss was a single occurrence. certain insureds, including the world
trade centers leaseholder, appealed that ruling, asking the court to determine
that the property loss constituted two separate occurrences rather than one. in september2003, the u.s. circuit
court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that under terms of the policy
form we used to underwrite property coverage for the world trade center, the
terrorist attack constituted one occurrence. additionally, through
separate litigation, the aviation losses could be deemed four separate events
rather than three, for purposes of insurance and reinsurance coverage. even if
the courts ultimately ruleagainst us regarding the number of occurrences
or events, we believe the additional amount of estimated after-tax losses, net
of reinsurance, that we would record would not be material to our results of
operations.

we did not include claims to be paid out of our
insurance reserves in the foregoing table, because of the significant
uncertainty involved in trying to project payments related to those reserves
into the future.
off- balance sheet
arrangements
we have entered into
certain off-balance-sheet arrangements in the course of conducting our
insurance operations, and from the sale of businesses. these arrangements are typically related to
transactions involving guarantees, derivative instruments, or variable interest
entities. we have disclosed the effects
of these arrangements in our footnotes to the consolidated financial
statements, specifically notes 7, 10, 12 and 16 included in item 8 of this
report. management does not believe that
these arrangements have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material
future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources.
critical accounting
policies
overview
the st. paul companies,inc.
is a holding company with subsidiaries operating in the property-liability
insurance industry and the asset management industry. we combine our financial
statements with those of our subsidiaries and present them on a consolidated
basis in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles.
our significant accounting policies are set forth in note 1 to our consolidated
financial statements. the following is a summary of the critical accounting
policies related to accounting estimates that 1) require us to make assumptions
about highly uncertain matters and 2) could materially impact our consolidated
financial statements if we made different assumptions. after the proposed
merger, management of the combined company will make decisions regarding the
integration of claims handling practices, actuarial practices and other
operational procedures. these decisions may impact managements estimate of
insurance loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.
loss reserves
the most significant estimates relate to our reserves
for property-liability insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses (lae). we
establish reserves for the estimated total unpaid cost of losses and lae, which
cover events that have already occurred. these reserves reflect our estimates
of the total cost of claims that were reported to us, but not yet paid (case
reserves), and the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us (ibnr
reserves). for reported losses, we establish case reserves within the
parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy, surety bond or
reinsurance agreement. for ibnr losses, we estimate reserves taking into
account various statistical and actuarial projection techniques as well as
other influencing factors. we continually review our reserves, using a variety
of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claim costs,
frequency and severity data, and prevailing economic, social and legal factors.
we also take into consideration other variables such as past loss experience,
changes in legislative conditions, changes in judicial interpretation of legal
liability and policy coverages, changes in claims handling practices and
inflation. we consider not only monetary increases in the cost of what we
insure, but also changes in societal factors that influence jury verdicts and
case law, our approach to claim resolution, and, in turn, claim costs.
for certain catastrophic events, there is considerable
uncertainty underlying the assumptions and associated estimated reserves for
losses and lae. reserves are reviewed regularly and, as experience develops and
additional information becomes known, including revised industry estimates of
the magnitude of a catastrophe, the reserves are adjusted as we deem necessary.
because many of the coverages we offer involve claims
that may not ultimately be settled for many years after they are incurred,
subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and
necessary component of our loss reserving process. we analyze our reserves by
considering a range of estimates bounded by a high and low point, and record
our best estimate within that range. we adjust reserves established in prior
years as loss experience develops and new information becomes available.
adjustments to previously
estimated reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in our financial
results in the periods in which they are made, and are referred to as prior
period development. because of the high level of uncertainty involved in these
estimates, revisions to our estimated reserves could have a material impact on
our results of operations in the period recognized, and ultimate actual
payments for claims and lae could turn out to be significantly different from
our estimates.
environmental
and asbestos reserves. reserves for
environmental and asbestos exposures cannot be estimated solely with the
traditional loss reserving techniques described above, which rely on historical
accident year development factors and take into consideration the previously
mentioned variables. environmental and asbestos reserves are more difficult to
estimate than our other loss reserves because of legal issues, societal factors
and difficulty in determining the parties who may ultimately be held liable. therefore,
in addition to taking into consideration the traditional variables that are
utilized to arrive at our other loss reserve amounts, we also look at the
length of time necessary to clean up polluted sites, controversies surrounding
the identity of the responsible party, the degree of remediation deemed to be
necessary, the estimated time period for litigation expenses, judicial
expansions of coverage, medical complications arising with asbestos claimants
advanced age, case law, and the history of prior claim development. we also consider
the impact of changes in the legal environment, including our experience in the
western macarthur matter, in establishing our reserves for other asbestos and
environmental cases. generally, case reserves and loss adjustment expense
reserves are established where sufficient information has been obtained to
indicate coverage under a specific insurance policy. we also consider end of
period reserves in relation to paid losses in a period. furthermore, ibnr
reserves are established to cover additional estimated exposures related to
policyholders that havent as yet asserted any claims as well as development on
reserves assumed from other entities. these reserves are continually reviewed
and updated as additional information is acquired.
our historical methodology (through first quarter
2002) for reviewing the adequacy of environmental and asbestos reserves
utilized a survival ratio metric, which considered ending reserves in relation
to calendar year paid losses. when the environmental reserve analyses were
completed in the second quarter of 2002, we supplemented our survival ratio
diagnostics with the detailed additional analyses referred to above, and
concluded that our environmental reserves were redundant by approximately $150
million. based on our additional analyses, we released approximately $150
million of environmental reserves in the second quarter of 2002. had we
continued to rely solely on our analysis of survival ratio, we would have
recorded no adjustment to our environmental reserves through the six months
ended june30, 2002.
in the second quarter of 2002, we also supplemented
our survival ratio analysis of asbestos reserves with a detailed claims
analysis. we determined that, excluding the impact of the western macarthur
settlement, our asbestos reserves were adequate; however, including that
impact, we determined that our asbestos reserves were inadequate. as a result,
gross and net asbestos reserves were increased $150 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2003, we updated our detailed
actuarial analysis for both asbestos and environmental reserves pertaining to
our exposure from direct policyholders and utilized these analyses in
determining the adequacy of our reserve provision for the remaining unreported
losses. for non-workers compensation asbestos claims, we supplemented this
detailed analysis with an additional analysis to determine an estimate of
reserves specifically for policyholders who have not as yet tendered their
first asbestos claim. as a result of these studies, we increased net asbestos
reserves by $77 million ($44 million in our ongoing operations and $33 million
in our runoff operations) and net environmental reserves by $14 million (all in
our ongoing operations). in addition, reviews of assumed and non-domestic
exposures caused us to increase net asbestos reserves by $13 million and reduce
net environmental reserves by $1 million (all of which was recorded in our
runoff operations).
health care reserves. during 2002, we concluded that the
impact of settling claims in a runoff environment in our health care operation
was causing abnormal effects on our average paid claims,
average outstanding
claims, and the amount of average case reserves established for new claims -
all of which are traditional statistics used by our actuaries to develop
indicated ranges of expected loss. taking these changing statistics into
account, we developed varying interpretations of our data, which implied added
uncertainty in our evaluation of these reserves. in the fourth quarter of 2002, we established
specific tools and indicators to more explicitly monitor and validate our key
assumptions supporting our health care reserve conclusions since our
traditional statistics and reserving methods needed to be supplemented in order
to provide a more meaningful analysis. the tools that were developed tracked the three primary indicators
which influenced our expectations and included: a) newly reported claims, b)
reserve development on known claims and c) the redundancy ratio, comparing
the cost of resolving claims to the reserve established for that individual
claim. various actuarial techniques can be used to estimate health care
reserves. while certain actuarial techniques could suggest a need for
materially different levels of reserves, management believes the techniques it
utilizes are the most appropriate under the circumstances.
for a detailed discussion about loss development
related to our health care reserves in 2003, refer to the health care section
of this discussion.
reinsurance
our reported written premiums, earned premiums and
losses and lae reflect the net effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance. premiums
are recorded at the inception of each policy, based on information received
from ceding companies and their brokers. for excess-of-loss contracts, the
amount of premium is usually contractually documented at inception, and no
management judgment is necessary in accounting for this. premiums are earned on
a pro rata basis over the coverage period. for proportional treaties, the
amount of premium is normally estimated at inception by the ceding company. we
account for such premium using the initial estimates, and adjust them once a
sufficient period for actual premium reporting has elapsed. reinstatement and
additional premiums are written at the time a loss event occurs where coverage
limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined
contract terms. reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the
restoration of the reinsurance limit of a catastrophe contract to its full
amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence. these
premiums relate to the future coverage obtained during the remainder of the
initial policy term, and are earned over the remaining policy term. additional
premiums are premiums charged after coverage has expired that are related to
experience during the policy term, which are earned immediately.
reinsurance accounting is followed for assumed and
ceded transactions when risk transfer requirements have been met. these
requirements involve significant assumptions being made relating to the amount
and timing of expected cash flows, as well as the interpretation of underlying
contract terms. reinsurance contracts that do not transfer significant
insurance risk are considered financing transactions and are required to be
accounted for as deposits.
we estimate and record an
allowance for reinsurance amounts that may not be collectible, due to credit
issues, disputes over coverage, or other considerations.
investments
we
continually monitor the difference between our cost and the estimated fair
value of investments, which involves uncertainty as to whether declines in
value are temporary in nature. if we believe a decline in the value of a
particular investment is temporary, we record the decline as an unrealized loss
in our common shareholders equity. if we believe the decline is other than
temporary, we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a
realized loss on our statement of operations. our assessment of a decline in
value includes our current judgment as to the financial position and future
prospects of the entity that issued the investment security. if that judgment
changes in the future, we may ultimately record a realized loss after having originally
concluded that the decline in value was temporary. the following
table summarizes the total pretax gross unrealized
loss recorded in our common shareholders equity at december31, 2003 and
2002, by invested asset class.

portfolio (at cost) at december31, 2003. the majority of unrealized
losses related to fixed income securities are issuer-specific rather than
interest rate-related.

in our venture capital portfolio, the sale of a large
portion of one of our investment holdings generated a pretax gain of $171
million in 2003, which was largely offset by impairment realized losses
totaling $143 million related to 38 of our investment holdings. fourteen of
those holdings were impaired due to a merger or sale at a value less than our
cost. eleven holdings experienced fundamental economic deterioration
(characterized by gross margins being less than expected, product pricing not
meeting initial projections due to market conditions, and greater than expected
manufacturing expenses). six holdings
were written down because
the entities progress was substantially less than planned and additional
financing was required at values less than our cost. an additional six holdings
were impaired due to cessation of operations of the entity. finally, one
holding was impaired because market demand for its product was less than
expected.
realized losses in our venture capital portfolio in
2002 included $56 million of losses resulting from the sale of the majority of
our partnership investment holdings, and impairment write-downs in 25 of our
holdings totaling $122 million. these holdings were impaired for the same
general reasons noted above for the 2003 impairments: seven holdings were
impaired because market demand for their products was less than expected; seven
holdings were written down because the entities progress was less than planned
and additional financing would be required; five holdings were impaired due to
fundamental economic deterioration (as defined above); four holdings were
impaired due to a merger or sale at less than our cost; and two holdings were
impaired due to cessation of operations.
at december31, 2003, non-investment grade
securities comprised less than 2% of our consolidated fixed income investment
portfolio, and nonrated securities comprised less than one half of one percent
of that portfolio. included in those categories at that date were securities in
an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of
$59 million and a fair value of $56 million, resulting in a net pretax
unrealized loss of $3 million. these securities represented less than 1% of the
total amortized cost and fair value of the fixed income portfolio at december31,
2003, and accounted for 6% of the total pretax unrealized loss in the fixed
income portfolio. included in those categories at december31, 2002 were
securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an
amortized cost of $160 million and a fair value of $140 million, resulting in a
net pretax unrealized loss of $20 million. these securities represented 1% of
the total amortized cost and fair value of the fixed income portfolio at dec.31,
2002, and accounted for 38% of the total pretax unrealized loss in the fixed
income portfolio.

our investment portfolio also includes non-publicly
traded securities, the vast majority of which are held in our venture capital
and real estate portfolios. our venture capital investments represent ownership
interests in small- to medium-sized companies, which are carried at estimated
fair value. fair values are based on an estimate determined by an internal valuation
committee for securities for which there is no public market. the internal
valuation committee reviews such factors as recent financings, operating
results, balance sheet stability, growth, and other business and market sector
fundamental statistics in estimating fair values of specific investments. for
our real estate joint ventures, we use the equity method of accounting, meaning
that we carry these investments at cost, adjusted for our share of earnings or
losses, and reduced by cash distributions from the partnerships and valuation
adjustments. due to time constraints in obtaining financial results from the
partnerships, the results of these operations are recorded
on a one-month lag. if
events occur during the lag period which are material to our consolidated
results, the impact is included in current period results.
the following discussion summarizes our process of
reviewing our investments for possible impairment.
fixed income and
securities on loanon
a monthly basis, these investments are reviewed by portfolio managers for
impairment. in general, the managers focus their attention on those fixed
income securities whose market value was less than 80% of their amortized cost
for at least one month in the previous nine months. factors considered in
evaluating potential impairment include the following.
the
degree to which any appearance of impairment is attributable to an overall
change in market conditions (e.g., interest rates) rather than changes in the
individual factual circumstances and risk profile of the issuer;
the
degree to which an issuer is current or in arrears in making principal and
interest payments on the debt securities in question;
the
issuers fixed-charge ratio at the date of acquisition and date of evaluation;
the
issuers current financial condition and its ability to make future scheduled
principal and interest payments on a timely basis;
the
independent auditors report on the issuers recent financial statements;
buy/hold/sell
recommendations of outside investment advisors and analysts;
relevant
rating history, analysis and guidance provided by rating agencies and analysts;
and
whether
or not we have the ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time
sufficient to allow for recovery, enabling us to receive value equal to or
greater than our cost.
equitieson a monthly basis, these investments are
reviewed by portfolio managers for impairment. in general, the managers focus
their attention on those equity securities whose market value was less than 80%
of their cost for six consecutive months. factors considered in evaluating
potential impairment include the following.
whether
the decline appears to be related to general market or industry conditions or
is issuer-specific;
the
relationship of market prices per share to book value per share at date of
acquisition and date of evaluation;
the
price-earnings ratio at the time of acquisition and date of evaluation;
our
ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow
for recovery in the market value;
the
financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any
specific events that may influence the issuers operations;
the
recent income or loss of the issuer;
the
independent auditors report on the issuers financial statements;
the
dividend policy of the issuer at date of acquisition and date of evaluation;
any
buy/hold/sell recommendations of investment advisors;
rating
agency announcements; and
price projections of
investment analysts.
venture capital
publicly
traded. on a monthly basis, individual public
investments are analyzed for impairment by portfolio managers as well as an
internal valuation committee. in general, attention is focused on those
marketable (public equity) securities whose market value has been less than
cost for six consecutive months. factors considered are the same as those
enumerated above for our equity investments.
non-publicly traded our non-publicly traded
venture capital portfolio generally consists of investments in early-stage
venture capital companies, historically with a holding period of four to seven
years. these investments have primarily been made in the health care, software
and computer services, and networking and information technologies
infrastructures industries. we typically are involved with venture capital
companies early in their formation, as they are developing and determining the
viability of, and market demand for, their product. we generally do not expect
these venture capital companies to record revenues in the early stages of their
development, which can often take three to four years, and do not generally
expect them to become profitable for an even longer period of time. as such,
our impairment analysis for these non-publicly traded venture capital
investments differs from that performed for both our equity investment
portfolio and our publicly-traded venture capital investments. with
respect to our valuation of such non-publicly traded venture capital
investments, on a quarterly basis, the portfolio managers as well as the
internal valuation committee review and consider a variety of factors in
determining the potential for loss impairment. factors considered include the
following.
the
issuers most recent financing events;
an
analysis of whether fundamental deterioration has occurred;
whether
or not the issuers progress has been substantially less than expected;
whether
or not the valuations have declined significantly in the entitys market
sector;
whether
or not the internal valuation committee believes there is a 50% probability
that the issuer will need financing within six months at a lower price than our
carrying value; and
whether
or not we have the ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time
sufficient to allow for recovery, enabling us to receive value equal to or
greater than our cost.
the quarterly (or monthly) valuation procedures
described above are in addition to the portfolio managers ongoing
responsibility to frequently monitor developments affecting those invested
assets, paying particular attention to events that might give rise to
impairment write-downs.
the size of our investment portfolio allows our
portfolio managers a degree of flexibility in determining which individual
investments should be sold to achieve our primary investment goals of assuring
our ability to meet our commitments to policyholders and other creditors and
maximizing our investment returns. in order to meet the objective of
maintaining a flexible portfolio that can achieve these goals, our fixed income
and equity portfolios are classified as available-for-sale. we continually
evaluate these portfolios, and our purchases and sales of investments are based
on our cash requirements, the characteristics of our insurance liabilities, and
current market conditions. at the time we determine an other than temporary
impairment in the value of a particular investment to have occurred, we
consider the current facts and circumstances and make a decision to either
record a write-down in the carrying value of the security or sell the security;
in either case, recognizing a realized loss.
with respect to our
venture capital portfolio, we manage our portfolio to maximize return,
evaluating current market conditions and the future outlook for the entities in
which we have invested. because this portfolio primarily consists of
privately-held, early-stage venture investments, events giving rise to
impairment
can occur in a brief period of time (e.g., the entity has been unsuccessful in
securing additional financing, other investors decide to withdraw their
support, complications arise in the product development process, etc.), and
decisions are made at that point in time, based on the specific facts and
circumstances, with respect to a recognition of other than temporary
impairment, or sale of the investment.
adoption of
accounting pronouncements
fasb staff position no. fas 106-1on
january 12, 2004, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued fasb
staff position no. fas 106-1, accounting and disclosure
requirements related to the medicare prescription drug, improvement and
modernization act of 2003 (fsp 106-1).
this pronouncement provides companies with the option to make a one-time
election to defer accounting for the effects of the medicare act referenced in
its title (the act). we have decided
to defer accounting for the act under fsp 106-1 and have made the required
disclosures in note 13retirement plans to the consolidated financial
statements. the final accounting
guidance could require changes to previously reported information. we will monitor the fasb deliberations and
account for the act based on the pronouncement expected to be issued.
fin
46(r)in january2003, the fasb issued fasb
interpretation no.46, consolidation of variable interest entities,
which was replaced in december2003 (fin 46(r)). fin 46(r), along with
its related interpretations, requires consolidation of all variable interest
entities (vie) by the primary beneficiary, as these terms are defined in
fin 46(r). we began applying the consolidation requirements for new vies in the
first quarter of 2003. for vies created before
january31, 2003, the effective date of adoption was deferred until the
first interim or annual period ending after december15, 2003 (for us, the
first quarter of 2004), but early and partial adoption were permitted.
we chose to partially adopt fin 46(r) under the early
adoption provisions in 2003, which resulted in us consolidating certain
entities (summarized below) that we had not previously consolidated. we are
still evaluating the implications of fin 46(r) on our participation in various
lloyds underwriting syndicates. upon partial adoption, we recorded a loss of
$21 million (net of a deferred tax benefit of $3 million) in our consolidated
statement of operations in 2003, classified as a cumulative effect of
accounting change and representing the cumulative impact of fin 46(r) on
periods prior to the july1, 2003 date of partial adoption.
the entities that
we consolidated (or deconsolidated, with respect to the preferred securities of
trusts) under our partial adoption of fin 46(r) were as follows.
investmentwe hold an investment in an
insurance company that provides insurance coverage to markets in baltimore and
washington d.c. our investment includes a substantial majority of the companys
convertible preferred stock, but none of its voting common stock. as a result
of our economic interest in the entity, we have the majority exposure to
variability through our preferred stock ownership and a loan to the company,
both of which are considered variable interests as defined in fin 46(r). accordingly,
we began consolidating this entity in the third quarter. the carrying value of
this investment at december31, 2003 was approximately $4 million.
municipal trustswe own interests in
various municipal trusts that were formed for the purpose of allowing us to
more flexibly generate investment income in a manner consistent with our
investment objectives and tax position. as of september30, 2003, there
were 36 such trusts, which held a combined total of $450 million in municipal
securities, of which eight had not been included in our consolidated financial
statements prior to our adoption of fin 46(r) because we did not hold majority
ownership in them. however, we do have the majority exposure to variability for
these trusts. therefore, we consolidated these eight trusts in 2003. the
combined carrying value of these trusts at december31, 2003 was $366
million.
venture capital entitiesin our venture
capital investment portfolio, we have numerous investments in small- to
medium-sized companies, in which we have variable interests through stock
ownership and, in some cases, loans. all of these investments are held for the
purpose of generating investment returns, and the companies in which we invest
span a variety of business sectors, including technology, telecommunications
and healthcare. as a result of our review of this portfolio, we identified
three entities that were required to be consolidated under the provisions of
fin 46(r). the combined carrying value of these entities at december31,
2003 was $(5)million.
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trusts
holding solely subordinated debentures of the company (preferred
securities)these securities had a carrying value of $897 million, and prior
to september30, 2003 were classified as a separate line on our balance
sheet between liabilities and shareholders equity. these securities were
issued by five separate trusts that were established for the sole purpose of
issuing the securities to investors, and the securities were fully guaranteed
by us. at september30, 2003, we reclassified these securities to debt
in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheet, as newly required
under statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no.150, accounting
for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and
equity, which generally required that an issuer classify a financial
instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some
circumstances). in the fourth quarter of 2003, we determined that the
provisions of fin 46(r) applied to the trusts that issued these securities, and
as a result we deconsolidated the trusts for financial reporting purposes. the
debt we issued to these trusts, previously eliminated in the consolidation of
our financial results, is now included in the debt section of liabilities on
our consolidated balance sheet. the net impact of de-consolidating these trusts
was to increase our reported debt liabilities outstanding by $928 million and
eliminate the $897 million of preferred securities issued by the trusts from
our consolidated balance sheet. the difference between the two amounts was
comprised of the $31 million combined equity interests we held in the
deconsolidated trusts.
the
consolidation/deconsolidation of the foregoing entities had the net impact of
increasing (decreasing) the balance sheet and statement of operations captions
by the amounts indicated in the following table.

in addition to the
foregoing entities that were consolidated pursuant to fin 46(r), we also hold
significant interests in other variable interest entities for which we are not
considered to be the primary beneficiary, as follows.
we
have a significant variable interest in two real estate entities, but we are
not considered to be the primary beneficiary. the total carrying value of these
entities was approximately $48 million as of september30, 2003, which
also represents our maximum exposure to loss. the purpose of our involvement in
these entities is to generate investment returns.
we
also have certain remaining variable interests in camperdown uk limited, an
entity that we sold in 2003. we utilized this entity as one of our corporate
names and the vehicle for our participation at lloyds for 2003 and prior years
of account through a single syndicate (syndicate 5000). our variable interest
results from an agreement to indemnify the purchaser in the event a specified
reserve deficiency develops, a reserve-related foreign exchange impact occurs,
or a foreign tax adjustment is imposed on a pre-sale reporting period. the
maximum amount of this indemnification obligation is $203 million. in addition,
in 2003 we entered into a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement with syndicate
5000 that in effect transferred syndicate 5000s underwriting results for the
2003 year of account to us.
sfas no. 150as noted
above, we adopted the provisions of sfas 150 in the third quarter of
2003 with respect to our preferred securities, our only financial instruments
that fell within the scope of sfas no.150. upon the application of the
provisions of fin 46(r) in the fourth quarter of 2003 to trusts that issued
these securities, we no longer have any financial instruments to which sfas no.150
applies.
sfas no. 141in 2002, we adopted the provisions of sfas no.141,
business combinations, which established financial accounting and reporting
standards for business combinations. (nuveen investments had applied the
relevant provisions of this statement to its 2001 acquisition of symphony asset
management llc). the statement requires all business combinations initiated
subsequent to june30, 2001 to be accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. in addition, this statement required that intangible assets that
can be identified and meet certain criteria be recognized as assets apart from
goodwill.
sfas no. 142in 2002, we implemented the provisions of sfas no.142,
goodwill and other intangible assets, which established financial accounting
and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. the statement
changed prior accounting requirements relating to the method by which
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, including goodwill, are tested
for impairment on an annual basis. it also required that those assets meeting
the criteria for classification as intangible assets with finite useful lives
be amortized to expense over those lives, while intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives and goodwill are not to be amortized. as a result of
implementing the provisions of this statement, we did not record any goodwill
amortization expense in 2003 or 2002. in 2001, goodwill amortization expense
totaled $114 million. amortization expense associated with intangible assets
totaled $31 million in 2003, compared with $18 million in 2002 and $2 million
2001.
in connection with our reclassification of certain
assets previously accounted for as goodwill to other intangible assets upon our
adoption of sfas no.142 in 2002, we established a deferred tax liability
of $6 million in the second quarter of 2002. that provision was classified as a
cumulative effect of accounting change effective as of january1, 2002. in
accordance with sfas no.142, we restated our results for the first
quarter of 2002, reducing net income for that period from the reported $139
million, or $0.63 per common share (diluted) to $133 million, or $0.60 per
common share (diluted).
sfas no. 144during 2002, we also implemented the provisions of sfas
no.144, accounting for impairment of long-lived assets. as a result of
implementation, we monitor the recoverability of the value of our long-lived
assets to be held and used based on our estimate of the future cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of
each asset and its eventual disposition considering any events or changes in
circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable. we monitor the value of our long-lived assets to be disposed of
and report them at the lower of carrying value or fair value less our estimated
cost to sell. we had no impairment adjustments related to our long-lived assets
in 2002.
sfas no. 133on january1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of sfas
no.133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities,
as amended by sfas nos. 137 and 138. provisions of sfas no.133 require
the recognition of derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance
sheet and
the measurement of
those instruments at fair value. we have limited involvement with derivative
instruments, primarily for purposes of hedging against fluctuations in market
indices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we also have
entered into a variety of other financial instruments considered to be
derivatives, but which are not designated as hedges, that we utilize to
minimize the potential impact of market movements in certain investment
portfolios. our adoption of sfas no 133, as amended, did not have a material
impact on our financial position or results of continuing operations.
goodwill and
intangible assets
at december31, 2003,
our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $1.07 billion, compared with $1.01
billion at december31, 2002. our asset management subsidiary, nuveen
investments,inc., accounted for the majority of the $52 million increase,
primarily resulting from additional goodwill recorded at the st. paul parent
company resulting from nuveen investments repurchase of common shares from its
minority shareholders. our acquisition of the right to renew certain business
from kemper insurance company in 2003 also contributed to the increase in
goodwill and intangible assets over 2002. in the second quarter of 2003, we
completed the annual evaluation of our recorded goodwill for impairment in
accordance with provisions of sfas no.142. that evaluation concluded that
none of our goodwill was impaired. see note 22 to the consolidated financial
statements in item 8 of this report for a schedule of goodwill and acquired
intangible assets.
elimination of
one-quarter reporting lags
in the
first quarter of 2003, we eliminated the one-quarter reporting lag for our
underwriting operations at lloyds to coincide with the timing of reporting for
all of our other international operations. as a result, our consolidated
results for 2003 included the results of those operations for the fourth
quarter of 2002 and all quarters of 2003. the incremental impact on our
property-liability operations of eliminating the reporting lag, consisting of
the results of these operations for the three months ended december31,
2003, was as follows.

in
2001, we eliminated the one-quarter reporting lag for our primary underwriting
operations in foreign countries (not including our operations at lloyds). as a
result, our consolidated results for 2001 include their results for the fourth
quarter of 2000 and all quarters of 2001. the incremental impact on our
property-liability operations for the year ended december31, 2001 of
eliminating the reporting lag, which consists of the results of these

reclassification of
lloyds commission expenses
in 2003, we reclassified
certain commission expenses related to our operations at lloyds. in prior
years, we determined commission expense based on premiums reported by the lloyds
market (net of commissions) using an estimated average commission rate. until
recently, gross premiums (prior to reduction for commissions) were not readily
available from the lloyds market. in 2003, we began recording actual
commission expense for our lloyds business. we reclassified prior period
results to record actual commission expense on a basis consistent with that
implemented in 2003. there was no impact to net income or shareholders equity
as previously reported for any prior periods, because the reclassification had
the impact of increasing previously reported premiums and commission expense in
equal and offsetting amounts. for the year ended december31, 2003, this
reclassification had the impact of increasing both net earned premiums and
policy acquisition costs by $81 million compared with what would have been
recorded under our prior method of estimation. in addition, net written
premiums increased by $116 million in 2003 (a portion of which was due to the
elimination of the one-quarter reporting lag). for the year ended december31,
2002, the impact was an increase to both net earned premiums and policy
acquisition costs of $112 million and an increase to net written premiums of
$91 million. for the year ended december31, 2001, the impact was an
increase to both net earned premiums and policy acquisition costs of $112
million and an increase to net written premiums of $132 million.
presentation of
certain information based on statutory accounting principles
our u.s.
property-liability insurance operations comprise the majority of our business. these
operations are required under applicable state insurance legislation and
regulations to publicly report information on the basis of statutory accounting
principles (sap), including net written premiums, statutory loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio, and statutory underwriting expense ratio information.
we provide in this report selected sap information for all of our
property-liability underwriting operations, as well as certain gaap information
for such operations. the types of sap information included herein are common
measures of the performance of a property-liability insurer, and we believe the
inclusion of such information will aid investors in comparing our results with
those of our peers in the industry. in addition, management uses this sap
information to monitor our financial performance. definitions of the statutory
information included herein are included in the definitions of certain
statutory accounting terms section of this discussion.
property-liability
operations
underwriting results by segment
underwriting result is
a common measurement of a property-liability insurers performance,
representing earned premiums less losses incurred and underwriting expenses. in
accordance with provisions of sfas no.131, disclosures about segments of
an enterprise and related information, we have designated underwriting result
as the measure we use to evaluate the performance of our property-liability
underwriting segments. the statutory
combined ratio, representing the sum of the statutory loss ratio and
the statutory expense ratio, is also a common measure of underwriting
performance. the statutory loss ratio measures insurance losses and loss adjustment
expenses incurred as a percentage of earned premiums. the statutory expense
ratio measures underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums
written. the lower the ratio, the better the result. the following table
summarizes net written premiums, underwriting results and combined ratios for
each of our property-liability underwriting business segments for the last
three years (underwriting results are presented on a gaap basis; combined
ratios are presented on a statutory accounting basis). all data for 2002 and
2001 were reclassified to conform to our new segment reporting format
implemented in 2003. following the table are an overview of our
property-liability operations and detailed analyses of our results by segment.

ratios are not meaningful in a runoff environment because the company has generally
ceased underwriting new business in these operations.
in discussions that
follow, we sometimes use the term prior-year loss development, which refers
to the income statement impact of changes in the provision for losses and lae
in a given year for claims incurred in periods prior to the year of the income
statement impact. similarly, we sometimes refer to current-year loss
development or current accident year loss activity, which refers to the
income statement impact of recording the provision for losses and lae in a
given year for losses incurred in that year.
property-liability insurance overview
as described earlier in this discussion, we revised
our segment reporting structure in 2003. our ongoing operations are reported in
two segmentsspecialty commercial and commercial lines. those operations which
are in runoff are reported in the other segment. premium growth of 24% in our ongoing
segments in 2003 was driven by strong business retention levels, price
increases, as well as new business (including premium volume resulting from our
acquisition of the right to renew certain business previously
underwritten by the kemper
insurance companies). both ongoing segments recorded strong premium increases
in 2002 over 2001, with the most notable growth occurring in our surety and
construction operations (primarily due to strong price increases in
construction, as well as acquisition-related premium growth in surety), and in
the specialty category of the specialty commercial segment (due to significant
price increases and new business volume in the majority of business centers
comprising that category). our consolidated net written premiums in 2001
included a reduction of $128 million for premiums ceded under specific
reinsurance treaties described below.
net written premium volume of $215 million in our
runoff segment in 2003 consisted primarily of prior-year premium adjustments in
our reinsurance operations and reporting endorsements (as defined in the health
care section of this report) in our health care operation. in our runoff
segment, 2002 premiums of $1.21 billion were 60% below the 2001 total of $3.03
billion, reflecting our decision at the end of 2001 to exit those lines of
business.
the strong improvement in underwriting results in our
ongoing segments in both 2003 and 2002 reflected the impact of significant
price increases over the last several years and the success of our efforts to
improve the quality of our book of business. our ongoing segments underwriting
results in 2001 included $279 million of losses related to the september11,
2001 terrorist attack.
the underwriting loss for our runoff segment in 2003
included a $350 million provision to strengthen prior-year loss reserves in our
health care operation, and additional prior-year provisions totaling $260
million in certain other operations in runoff as described in more detail in
the other section of this discussion. in 2002, the underwriting loss for our
runoff segment included a $472 million pretax loss related to the western macarthur
asbestos litigation settlement, and significant provisions to strengthen
prior-year loss reserves in certain of our operations in runoff. in 2001, the
$1.87 billion underwriting loss in our runoff segment was driven by the $735
million of prior-year loss reserves in our health care operation, and $662
million of losses related to the terrorist attack.
our ongoing segments expense ratios improved in both
2003 and 2002, reflecting the combined effect of significant premium growth in
both years, as well as efficiencies realized throughout our underwriting
operations as a result of our expense reduction initiatives over the last three
years. the magnitude of improvement in 2002 over 2001 was mitigated somewhat by
the impact of written premiums ceded for terrorism coverage. expense reduction
efforts in recent years included the consolidation of field office locations,
the streamlining of our claim organization, the restructuring of several of our
business segments, and the combined elimination of approximately 1,200 employee
positions since our strategic initiatives announced in december2001. as a
result of those and other expense management initiatives, we were able to
reduce our fixed expenses in both 2003 and 2002.
reinsurance
treaties. in
2001, we entered into two aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties. under
the terms of the reinsurance treaties, we transferred, or ceded, insurance
losses and loss adjustment expenses to our reinsurers, along with the related
written and earned premiums. one of these treaties was corporate-wide, with
coverage triggered when our insurance losses and lae across all lines of
business reached a certain level, as prescribed by terms of the treaty. we did
not cede any losses to the corporate treaty in 2001, but we recorded a $34
million net detriment in 2001 related to a similar treaty we were party to in
2000, primarily due to adjustments for cessions made in 2000. we did not enter
into such a treaty in 2003 or 2002. our reinsurance operation was party to a
separate aggregate excess-of-loss treaty in 2002 and 2001. the results of our
reinsurance operation in 2002 and 2001 included a $34 million detriment and a
$159 million benefit, respectively, related to those treaties. the detriment in
2002 primarily resulted from the commutation of a portion of the 2001 treaty. we
did not cede any losses to our reinsurance operations 2002 excess-of-loss
treaty. the 2001 benefit resulted from losses ceded to the 2001 treaty.
catastrophe
losses. effective
january1, 2003, we changed our disclosure regarding catastrophe losses. we
no longer classify all losses from insurance services office (iso)-defined
catastrophes as
catastrophe losses. we
revised our definition of losses reported as catastrophes to include only
those events that we believe generate losses beyond a level normally expected
in our business. this revised definition has no impact on our recorded results
for any period included in this report. catastrophe losses reported in prior
periods have been revised to conform to our new definition. in 2003, we did not
experience any significant catastrophe losses, as newly defined; however, we
recorded a net $55 million reduction in the provision for catastrophes incurred
in prior years, nearly all of which was related to the september11, 2001
terrorist attack.
catastrophe losses in 2002
totaled $31 million, primarily resulting from several storms across the united
states throughout the year. catastrophe losses totaled $1.27 billion in 2001,
of which $941 million was due to the september11th terrorist
attack. the majority of the remaining catastrophe losses in 2001 largely
resulted from of a variety of storms throughout the year in the united states
and the explosion of a chemical manufacturing plant in toulouse, france. since
catastrophe losses are not recognized until an event occurs, the occurrence of
a catastrophic event can have a material impact on our results of operations
during the period incurred. subsequent changes to our estimate of catastrophic
losses, based on better information, can also materially impact our results of
operations during that period.
specialty commercial
the business centers comprising this segment are
designated specialty commercial operations because each provides dedicated
underwriting, claim and risk control services that require specialized
expertise, and each focuses exclusively on the respective customers it serves. insurance
coverage is often provided on proprietary insurance forms. this segment
includes our surety and construction operations, our ongoing international& lloyds
operations and eight other specialty business centers collectively referred to
as specialty.
we consider our surety
and construction
business centers to be specialty operations, because each business requires
specialized underwriting, risk management and claim expertise. our surety business center underwrites surety
bonds, which are agreements under which one party (the surety) guarantees to
another party (the owner or obligee) that a third party (the contractor or
principal) will perform in accordance with contractual obligations. for contract surety, we provide bid, performance and payment
bonds, to a broad spectrum of clients specializing in general contracting,
highway and bridge construction, asphalt paving, underground and pipeline
construction, manufacturing, civil and heavy engineering, and mechanical and
electrical construction. bid bonds provide financial assurance that the bid has
been submitted in good faith and that the contractor intends to enter into the
contract at the price bid and provide the required performance and payment
bonds. performance bonds require us to fulfill the contractors obligations to
the obligee should the contractor fail to perform under the contract. payment
bonds guarantee that the contractor will pay certain subcontractor, labor and
material bills associated with a project. for commercial
surety, we currently offer license and permit bonds, reclamation
bonds, fiduciary bonds, court bonds, public official bonds, indemnity bonds,
workers compensation self-insurer bonds, transfer agent indemnity bonds,
depository bonds, and other miscellaneous bonds. in addition to its u.s.
operations, our surety business center includes our mexican subsidiary,
afianzadora insurgentes, the largest surety bond underwriter in mexico, and our
canadian operation st. paul guarantee, the largest surety bond underwriter in
canada. in total, based on 2002 premium volume, our surety operations are the
largest in north america. the construction
business center offers a variety of products and services, including
traditional insurance and risk management solutions, to a broad range of
contractors and parties responsible for construction projects.
our international&
lloyds operation consists of the following components: our ongoing
operations at lloyds, and our ongoing specialty commercial operations outside
of the united states, including our global accounts business center
(collectively referred to hereafter as international specialties). through a
single syndicate at lloyds (for which we provide 100% of the capital), we
underwrite insurance in four
principal lines of
business: aviation, marine, global property and personal lines. aviation
underwrites a broad spectrum of international airline, manufacturer, airport
and general aviation business. marine underwrites energy, cargo and hull
coverages. global property underwrites property coverages worldwide. personal
lines provides specialized accident and health coverages for international
clients, including personal accident, kidnap and ransom, and payment protection
insurance. our ongoing international specialties (other than global accounts)
are located in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of ireland, where we
offer specialized insurance and risk management services to a variety of
industry sectors. our global accounts business center is based in the united
states.
the following nine specialty business centers comprise
the remainder of the specialty commercial segment and are collectively referred
to as specialty in the following table. financial&
professional services provides coverages for financial institutions,
including property, liability, professional liability and management liability
coverages for corporations and nonprofit organizations; and errors and
omissions coverages for a variety of professionals such as lawyers, insurance
agents and real estate agents. technology
offers a comprehensive portfolio of specialty products and services to
companies involved in telecommunications, information technology, health
sciences and electronics manufacturing. umbrella/excess& surplus lines provides insurance coverage
in two distinct markets. the specialty excess and
umbrella unit focuses on umbrella and
excess liability business for retail and wholesale distribution sources, where
other insurance companies provide the primary coverage. the excess&
surplus lines unit underwrites non-admitted program and individual
risk business for established wholesale distributors. the excess and
surplus lines underwriting facilities business center underwrites
liability and property facilities produced by wholesalers and managing general
agents. public sector services markets insurance
products and services to municipalities, counties, indian nation gaming and
selected special government districts, including water and sewer utilities, and
non-rail transit authorities. discover re
provides insurance programs principally involving property, liability and
workers compensation coverages, serving retail brokers and insureds who are
committed to the alternative risk transfer market. alternative risk transfer
techniques are typically utilized by insureds who are financially able to
assume a substantial portion of their own losses. oil and gas
provides specialized property and liability products for customers involved in
the exploration and production of oil and gas. ocean marine
provides insurance coverage internationally for ocean and inland waterways
traffic. personal catastrophe risk underwrites
personal property coverages in certain states exposed to earthquakes and
hurricanes.
the
following table summarizes results for this segment for the last three years. in
accordance with provisions of sfas no.131, disclosures about segments of
an enterprise and related information, since our surety and construction
business centers were combined and reported as a separate segment in 2002, and
our international& lloyds operations were reported as a separate
segment in 2002, we continue to separately present and discuss their results
for each of the years in the three-year period ended december31, 2003
because they are considered to be of continuing significance in analyzing the
results of our operations.

contributed to the strong premium growth over 2002. financial and professional services premium volume of $624
million in 2003 was 56% higher than comparable 2002 premiums of $400 million,
driven by price increases and new business principally generated by our december2002
acquisition of the right to seek to renew the professional and financial risk
practice business of royal and sunalliance, and the may2003 acquisition
of the right to seek to renew architects and engineers professional liability
business from kemper insurance companies. technologys
net written premiums of $426 million in 2003 grew 15% over 2002 premium volume
of $372 million, primarily due to price increases and new business. personal catastrophe risk premium volume
of $131 million in 2003 was more than double the 2002 total of $61 million, due
to a change in our reinsurance program related to this operation that resulted
in less business being ceded to reinsurers. price increases averaged 20% across
the specialty category in 2003 (excluding discover
re and personal catastrophe risk,
whose premium structures differ somewhat from the remaining business centers in
this category), compared with 29% in 2002.
virtually all business centers in the specialty
category contributed to the $182 million increase in underwriting profitability
in 2003. the most notable improvements over 2002 were achieved by the technology business center, with a $99
million increase in underwriting profit, and financial&
professional services, with a $39 million increase in underwriting
profit. the technology result in
2003 included $74 million of favorable prior-year loss development. improved
underwriting discipline with respect to risk selection, significant price
increases in recent years and the addition of profitable new business through
acquisitions have contributed to increased profitability in the specialty category.
2002 vs. 2001the 22% increase in net written premium
volume in 2002 over 2001 was driven by price increases and new business in
several business centers. virtually every business center in this segment
achieved an increase in premium volume over 2001. in financial& professional services, premium volume
of $400 million grew 21% over 2001 due to strong price increases, particularly
in the directors and officers line of business. umbrella/excess& surplus lines written premiums
of $253 million were more than double comparable 2001 volume of $116 million,
driven by a new commercial umbrella operation launched in 2002. technology premiums of $372 million in
2002 were slightly higher than the 2001 total of $366 million, reflecting the
effects of the economic weakness in the technology market sector.
the success of our
underwriting and pricing actions throughout this category were reflected in the
$188 million improvement in profitability over 2001. underwriting profits in financial& professional services
in 2002 were $74 million higher than in 2001. personal
catastrophe risk achieved a $37 million increase in profitability
over 2001. all of our operations in the specialty category benefited in 2002
from strong price increases and the relative lack of catastrophe losses. underwriting
results in 2001 included $51 million of losses related to the september11,
2001 terrorist attack.
international&
lloyd s
2003 vs. 2002net
written premium volume of $1.33 billion in 2003 included $64 million of
incremental premiums from the elimination of the one-quarter reporting lag at
our operations at lloyds (the remaining $3 million of incremental premiums
described earlier in this discussion were recorded in our runoff other segment).
excluding that additional $64 million, premium volume in 2003 of $1.27 billion
was still 44% higher than in 2002. we experienced strong growth in our
operations at lloyds due to price increases, new business, favorable foreign
currency exchange impacts and our increased participation in lloyds following
the consolidation of most of our lloyds operations into one wholly-owned
syndicate in 2003. our total lloyds premium volume in 2003 was $705 million
(including the impact of the elimination of the one quarter reporting lag),
compared with $398 million in 2002. in our international specialty operations,
premium volume of $627 million was 30% higher than comparable 2002 premiums of
$483
million. price increases,
new business and strong renewal retention rates all contributed to the strong
growth over 2002. new business volume was particularly strong in canada.
the improvement in underwriting results in 2003 was
concentrated in our international specialty operations, particularly in canada
and the united kingdom. the underwriting profit at our operations at lloyds
was down slightly from 2002, primarily due to $24 million of prior year losses
in the personal lines business unit at lloyds.
2002 vs. 2001at lloyds, 2002 premium volume of $398
million grew 24% over comparable 2001 premiums of $320 million, primarily
driven by strong price increases and new business in certain classes of our
personal lines business. in addition, aviation premiums increased significantly
due to our increased participation in that coverage in 2002. in our
international specialty operations, premium volume of $483 million was 22%
higher than the 2001 total of $397 million, driven by price increases and new
business throughout these operations. the 2001 total included approximately $44
million of incremental premiums from the elimination of the one-quarter
reporting lag.
our international
specialty operations and our operations at lloyds both contributed to the $291
million improvement in underwriting results in 2002 compared with 2001. price
increases and the absence of significant weather-related losses were factors in
the improvement over 2001. underwriting results in 2001 included $90 million of
losses related to the september11, 2001 terrorist attack.
surety and
construction
2003 vs. 2002net written premiums generated by our surety business center totaled $475
million in 2003, down 1% compared with premiums of $480 million in 2002. the
decline was primarily due to the closing of certain field offices, the impact
of underwriting actions to improve the risk profile of our book of business,
and increased reinsurance costs. in our construction
operation, net written premium volume in 2003 of $759 million was 3% less than
premiums of $786 million in 2002, as the impact of price increases in 2003 was
offset by a reduction in new business.
the surety underwriting
loss totaled $168 million in 2003, compared with an underwriting loss of $111
million in 2002. suretys 2003
underwriting loss included an $59 million pretax loss provision (net of
reinsurance) related to one of our accounts that was in bankruptcy and unable
to perform its bonded obligations. in april2003, a bankruptcy court
approved the sale of substantially all of the assets of the account. following
that approval, we received claim notices with respect to approximately $120
million of bonds securing certain workers compensation and retiree health
benefit obligations of the account. we originally recorded a net pretax loss
provision of $89 million when the claim notices were received and determined to
be valid. in the fourth quarter of 2003, we re-estimated the amount of
reinsurance recoverable related to that pretax loss, and recorded a $27 million
reduction in our net loss. conversely, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we
recorded a $27 million provision to strengthen our surety operations prior-year loss reserves, primarily
related to a re-estimation of reinsurance recoverable related to losses
incurred in 2002 associated with enron corporations bankruptcy. the 2002 surety underwriting loss included a $34
million loss provision recorded after a judicial decision regarding surety
bonds issued in connection with the construction of two large brazilian oil
rigs.
the construction
underwriting profit of $7 million in 2003 represented a significant improvement
over the 2002 underwriting loss of $110 million, which included significant
charges to strengthen prior-year reserves, as discussed in more detail below. the
improvement over 2002 reflected the impact of significant price increases and
our efforts to improve the quality of our book of business through the
nonrenewal of underperforming accounts and the selective addition of new
business.
in our surety
operation, we continued to experience an increase in the frequency of reported
losses in 2003. certain segments of our surety business tend to be
characterized by low frequency but potentially high severity losses.
within our commercial surety segments, we have
exposures related to a small number of accounts, which are now in various
stages of bankruptcy proceedings. in addition, certain other accounts have
experienced deterioration in creditworthiness since we issued bonds to them. given
the current economic climate and its impact on these companies, we may
experience an increase in claims and, possibly, incur high severity losses. such
losses would be recognized in the period in which the claims are filed and
determined to be a valid loss under the provisions of the surety bond issued.
with regard to commercial surety bonds issued on
behalf of companies operating in the energy trading sector, our aggregate
pretax exposure, net of facultative reinsurance, is with five companies for a
total of approximately $367 million ($305 million of which is from gas supply
bonds), an amount that will decline over the contract periods. the largest
individual exposure approximates $181 million (pretax). these companies all
continue to perform their bonded obligations and, therefore, no claims have
been filed.
in addition to our largest exposure discussed above
with respect to energy trading companies, our commercial surety business as of december31,
2003 included seven accounts with gross pretax bond exposures greater than $100
million each, before reinsurance. the majority of these accounts have
investment grade ratings, and all accounts continue to perform their bonded
obligations.
in 2003, we secured excess of loss reinsurance
coverage for our commercial surety exposures in the form of two new treaties
providing $500 million of aggregate loss limits over a five-year period, with a
maximum recovery of $100 million per principal for gas supply bonds and $150
million per principal for other bonds. the reinsurance program does not extend
coverage to the small number of commercial surety accounts which were in
bankruptcy at the inception of the reinsurance treaties.
we continue with our intention to exit the segments of
the commercial surety market discussed above by ceasing to write new business
and, where possible, terminating the outstanding bonds. since october2000,
when we made a strategic decision to significantly reduce the exposures in
these segments, our total commercial surety gross open bond exposure has
decreased by over 56% as of december31, 2003. we will continue to be a
market for traditional commercial surety business, which includes low-limit
business such as license and permit, probate, public official, and customs
bonds.
in the contract surety business, creditworthiness is a
primary underwriting consideration and the underwriting process involves a
number of factors, including consideration of a contractors financial
condition, business prospects, experience and management. the risk in respect
of a contract surety bond changes over time. such risk tends to decrease as the
related construction project is completed, but may increase to the extent the
financial condition of the contractor deteriorates or difficulties arise during
the course of the project. losses in the contract surety business can occur as
a result of a contractors failure to complete its bonded obligations in
accordance with the contract terms. such losses, if any, would be estimated by estimating
the cost to complete the remaining work (which may include amounts advanced to
the contractor by the surety) and the contractors unpaid bills, offset by
monies due to the contractor, reinsurance and the estimated net realizable
value of collateral. while our contract surety business typically has not been
characterized by high severity losses, it is possible, given the current
economic climate, that significant losses could occur.
some of our contract surety business, particularly
with respect to larger accounts, is written on a co-surety basis with other
surety underwriters in order to manage and limit our aggregate exposure. certain
of these sureties have experienced, and may continue to experience,
deterioration in their financial condition and financial strength ratings. if a
loss is incurred and one of our co-sureties fails to meet its obligations
under a bond, we and any
other co-surety or co-sureties on the bond typically are jointly and severally
liable for such obligations. as a result, our losses could significantly
increase to the extent such an event or events occur.
in the third quarter of 2003, we made collateralized
advances to a construction contractor that had failed to make payments under
certain of its debt obligations. these third quarter advances did not impact
our results of operations because the loss incurred was offset by our estimated
recoverable.
in recent months, the contractor has completed a
restructuring of its finances and entered into revised credit agreements with its
lenders. as part of our strategy to mitigate our ultimate exposure to this
account by facilitating the contractors efforts to complete bonded projects,
we made additional advances for which we recorded an after-tax loss, net of
estimated reinsurance and co-surety participation, of approximately $13 million
in the fourth quarter of 2003. in february and early march 2004, we made or
committed to make additional advances for which we recorded a net after-tax
loss of approximately $15 million. we have not changed our estimate of the
recoverable from that established at the end of the third quarter of 2003. any
future changes in our estimate of the recoverable, whether positive or
negative, will affect our results of operations. we may make further advances
and, subject to our underwriting criteria, we may also decide to issue bonds
for new projects undertaken by this contractor.
if the contractor were to fail to complete its bonded
projects, we estimate that our aggregate additional loss, net of estimated
collateral, reinsurance recoveries and participation by co-sureties (one of
which has experienced ratings downgrades and is in runoff), would likely not
exceed $75 million on an after-tax basis, assuming a 35% statutory tax rate. given
the uncertainties relating to the contractors business and other factors,
there is no assurance that our estimate and our potential exposure will not
increase.
2002 vs.2001total
combined premium volume for our surety
and construction operations
increased by $293 million over 2001, primarily driven by $220 million of
premium growth in construction,
where price increases averaged 30% in 2002. in the surety business center, premium volume was $73 million
higher than in 2001, primarily due to the combined $100 million contributed by
st. paul guarantee in canada (formerly london guarantee), acquired in march2002,
and our acquisition in late 2001 of the right to seek to renew surety business
previously underwritten by firemans fund insurance company (see the
acquisitions and divestitures section of this discussion for further details
about these acquisitions). excluding the impact of the two acquisitions, suretys
net premium volume in 2002 was slightly below comparable 2001 levels,
reflecting the tightened underwriting standards instituted in recent years,
particularly with respect to our commercial surety business, and an increase in
domestic reinsurance costs in 2002.
both
business centers contributed to the $182 million deterioration in underwriting
results compared with 2001. the construction underwriting loss of $110 million
was $75 million worse than the comparable 2001 loss of $35 million, driven by
adverse prior-year loss development that prompted a $113 million fourth-quarter
provision to strengthen loss reserves in our general liability and workers
compensation coverages. the 2002 current accident year loss ratio for
construction, however, was much improved over the same 2001 ratio, reflecting
the impact of strong underwriting initiatives, price increases and the shift to
a larger-sized account profile. approximately
$93 million of constructions $113 million adverse prior year development was
concentrated in general liability coverages. the table below allocates
the general liability coverage portion of our reserve charge in 2002, by
accident year, within our construction business center.

our analysis of trends for our
general liability coverages in 2002 revealed case reserve strengthening
occurring throughout the year. in addition, actual loss development during the
year continued to exceed our expectations. the average paid closed claim trend
had exceeded the average case reserve trend in the recent development. the
average outstanding case reserve increased from $54,000 at year-end 2001 to
$66,000 at year-end 2002. the average paid claim increased from $18,000 at
year-end 2001 to $28,000 at year-end 2002. while the average paid claim was
still below the average case reserve, this development in the data caused us to
revise our trends and increase our estimate of ultimate losses. we increased
our estimate of required loss reserves and recorded a $93 million increase to
loss reserves. however, no changes were made to any other underlying
assumptions.
the remaining reserve charge of
$20 million related to workers compensation coverages (with beginning 2002
reserves of $363 million), primarily from the 2001 accident year. this charge
resulted from a comprehensive claim review which focused on, among other data,
a better estimate of our life-time benefit obligations. as a result of this
review, we increased the number of claims identified as receiving life-time
benefits and, accordingly, increased the related loss reserves. no changes were
made to our underlying assumptions.
suretys 2002 underwriting loss was $111 million,
compared with a loss of $4 million in 2001. the 2002 results reflected
prior-year reserve charges of $104 million, which included $34 million related
to the judgment regarding the petrobras oil rig construction related to a 1996
incident, and $7 million for the settlement of litigation related to surety
contracts issued on behalf of enron corporation related to a 2001 reported
incident. suretys underwriting results in 2002 were also negatively impacted
by reinstatement premiums paid for contract surety reinsurance, which reduced
our net earned premiums, as well as an increase in losses in our contract
surety business where we have experienced a higher than normal level of loss
frequency.
in
addition to the petrobras and enron events referred to above, we experienced an
increase in the frequency of losses in 2002, with much of this increase being
tied to the economic downturn in north america. included in the $104 million of
prior-year development for 2002 was a fourth-quarter provision totaling $63
million in our domestic surety operations as detailed in the following table. the
entire surety business center prior year reserve charge was driven by
development on specific claims. since surety losses are not recognized until
the period a claim is filed, no changes were made to assumptions. the insurance
concept of accident year is not meaningful to surety
business. the yearly information in the following table represents the year in
which we determined that an incident had occurred, which might give rise to a
possible claim.

commercial lines
the commercial lines segment includes our small commercial, middle market commercial and property solutions business centers, as
well as the results of our limited involvement in involuntary insurance pools. the
small commercial business center
services commercial firms that typically have between one and fifty employees
through its proprietary st. paul mainstreet(sm) and st. paul
advantage(sm) products, with a particular focus on offices,
wholesalers, retailers, artisan contractors and other service risks. the middle market commercial business center
offers comprehensive insurance coverages for a wide variety of manufacturing,
wholesale, service and retail exposures, as well as programs for selected
industries that are national in scope and have similar risk characteristics such
as franchises and associations. the majority of these programs were formerly
classified as a separate specialty programs business center in our specialty
commercial segment but were reclassified in 2003 to our middle market commercial business center
in the commercial lines segment to more accurately reflect the manner in which
this business is underwritten and managed. this business center also offers
loss-sensitive casualty programs, including significant deductible and
self-insured retention options, for the higher end of the middle market sector.
the property solutions business
center combines our large accounts property business with the commercial
portion of our catastrophe risk business and allows us to take a unified
approach to large property risks.

2003 vs. 2002the 26% increase in net written premium
volume in 2003 over 2002 was driven by a combination of higher customer
retention, continued price increases, and significant new business generated by
our acquisition of the right to renew certain business previously underwritten
by kemper insurance companies (described in more detail earlier in this
discussion). after several years of significant
price increases and
selective re-underwriting of our book of business in this segment, our focus in
2003 was on retaining the quality new business developed in recent years. although
the pace of price increases began to slow in 2003, continued favorable market
conditions and our strong presence in the marketplace provided us with the
opportunity to achieve further price increases, where appropriate. price
increases across the entire segment averaged 11% for the year. throughout the
commercial lines segment in 2003, we continued to nonrenew underperforming
classes of business and utilize our distribution network to capitalize on new
business opportunities. the kemper renewal rights transaction provided an
influx of quality exposures that augmented the solid base of business we have
built in recent years.
in our middle market commercial
business center, net written premium volume of $1.61 billion was 31% higher
than comparable 2002 premiums of $1.23 billion. in the small
commercial business center, written premiums of $741 million grew
19% over 2002 premiums of $622 million. after extensive efforts in 2002 to
build our capability to serve the small commercial marketplace, we turned our
focus in 2003 to launching our insurance products tailored to meet the needs of
this market sector. in the property
solutions business center, 2003 premium volume of $73 million was
31% higher than 2002 premiums of $56 million, primarily due to new business
volume and a reduction in the amount of business ceded to reinsurers.
the commercial lines underwriting profit of $235
million in 2003 was over 65% higher than the comparable 2002 profit of $141
million, primarily driven by strong improvement in current accident year
results in each business center comprising the segment. the growth in
profitability in 2003 was achieved despite a significant increase in
weather-related losses in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily resulting from
storms throughout the united states during the year. results in 2003 also
benefited from $30 million of favorable development on prior-year loss reserves.
the 2003 underwriting profit reflects the success of our stringent underwriting
principles and aggressive risk control efforts, as well as the significant
impact of price increases achieved in 2002 and 2003. in addition, in 2003 we
accelerated our focus on expense discipline, which resulted in an over
one-point improvement in our statutory expense ratio for the year. as we
continue to emphasize productivity enhancements, including increased use of
automation and processing improvement initiatives, we expect further
improvements in our expense ratio going forward.
2002 vs. 2001premium growth of 15% in 2002 was
primarily due to price increases, the impacts of which were offset somewhat by
a decline in business retention levels resulting from our efforts to increase
profitability. we capitalized on favorable market conditions in 2002 by
implementing significant price increases, rejecting new and renewal business
where we could not achieve appropriate price increases, and selectively adding
new business that met our pricing and underwriting criteria. price increases
across the entire segment averaged 23% in 2002. middle market commercial net written premiums totaled $1.23
billion in 2002, 9% higher than 2001 premiums of $1.12 billion. our focus in
2002 was to maximize the quality and profitability of our middle market book of
business; as a result, the impact of significant rate increases was
substantially offset by reductions in business retention rates and new business
levels. small commercial premium
volume of $622 million in 2002 grew 7% over 2001 premiums of $575 million. we
greatly expanded our involvement in the small commercial marketplace in 2002
through the development of products to serve particular sectors of the market,
and through investments in technology to enable easy access to those products by
agents, brokers and insureds.
the commercial lines
segment total underwriting profit in 2002 of $141 million was significantly
improved over the 2001 underwriting loss of $153 million, which included $136
million of losses related to the september11, 2001 terrorist attack. current
accident-year results in 2002 in all three business centers in this segment
improved over 2001, with the most notable improvement occurring in middle market commercial. the $158 million
improvement in underwriting results from 2001 to 2002 (after excluding losses
from the terrorist attack in 2001) reflected the impact of price increases and
the improvement in the quality of our book of business, as well as a decline in
weather-related losses. in 2001, reported results would have been significantly
worse if not for the benefit of a $128 million reduction in prior-year loss
reserves, of which $93 million related to certain business written prior to
1988.
property-liability

other
this segment includes the results of the lines of
business we placed in runoff in late 2001 and early 2002, including our former
health care and reinsurance segments, and the results of the following
international operations: our runoff operations at lloyds, including our
participation in the insuring of the lloyds central fund; unionamerica, the
london-based underwriting unit acquired as part of our purchase of mmi in 2000;
and international operations we decided to exit at the end of 2001. we have a
management team in place for these operations, seeking to ensure that our
outstanding claim obligations are settled in an expeditious and economical
manner. this segment also includes the results of our participation in
voluntary insurance pools, as well as loss development on business underwritten
prior to 1980 (prior to 1988 for business acquired in our merger with usf&g
corporation in 1998). in addition to our participation in voluntary insurance
pools, this prior year business includes the majority of our environmental and
asbestos liability exposures. the oversight of these exposures is the
responsibility of the same management team responsible for oversight of the
other components of the other segment.
our health care operation historically provided a wide range of medical
liability insurance products and services throughout the entire health care
delivery system. our reinsurance operations historically underwrote treaty and
facultative reinsurance for a wide variety of property and liability exposures.
the
following table summarizes key financial data for each of the last three years

in a runoff environment because the company has generally ceased underwriting
new business in these operations.

health care
2003 vs.2002written
premiums in 2003 primarily consisted of extended reporting endorsements and a
small amount of professional liability coverage for other professionals such as
dentists, nurse anesthetists, and other healthcare professionals who are not
physicians or surgeons. these other professional policies were part of
three-year policies that we had committed to prior to our exit from the health
care lines of business in 2001. additionally, we are required to offer
reporting endorsements to claims-made policy holders at the time their policies
are not renewed. these endorsements cover losses that occurred in prior periods
that have not yet been reported. unlike typical policies, premiums on these
endorsements are fully earned, and the expected losses are fully reserved, at
the time the endorsement is written. the vast majority of reporting
endorsements underwritten in 2003 pertained to physicians and surgeons
liability coverage.
the
2003 underwriting loss included a $350 million provision recorded in the fourth
quarter to increase net prior accident year loss reserves. the majority of
remaining underwriting losses in 2003 consisted of current-year loss provisions
related to reporting endorsements. further information regarding the $350 million
prior-year loss provision is included in the following table.

the significant allocation to the three most recent
incurred years is consistent with the nature of the claims-made insurance
product. the average payment date on this book of reserves is approximately two
years, meaning that 50% of the losses will be settled within two years. accordingly,
the change in assumptions that resulted in the $350 million charge in 2003
significantly impacted the most recent incurred years, as expected.
2002 vs.2001written premiums in 2002 were generated
by extended reporting endorsements and professional liability coverages
underwritten primarily in the first quarter of the year prior to our
non-renewal notifications becoming effective in several states. the majority of
reporting endorsements underwritten in 2002 pertained to physicians and
surgeons liability coverage.
the
2002 underwriting loss included $85 million in provisions to increase net prior
accident year loss reserves, comprised specifically of a $97 million charge in
the second quarter of the year, and reductions totaling $12 million throughout
the year resulting primarily from reinsurance contract commutations. the
majority of remaining losses in 2002 consisted of current-year loss provisions
related to reporting endorsements. details regarding the $97 million prior-year
loss provision recorded in the second quarter of 2002 are included in the

analysis of loss
provisions recorded. in the years ended december31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, we recorded net provisions of $350 million, $85 million
and $735 million, respectively, to strengthen prior accident year loss reserves
in our health care operation. the following table presents a rollforward of
loss activity for the health care operation for the years ended december31,
2003, 2002 and 2001. this information includes loss amounts and claim data for
our entire domestic health care operation, whereas tables presented elsewhere
in this discussion relate only to our domestic medical malpractice line of
business.

the following presents a summary of trends we observed
within our health care operation, by quarter, for the three-year period ended december31,
2003. the discussion focuses on our medical malpractice line of business, since
99% of the reserve adjustments related to this business. our medical
malpractice business includes all medical liability coverage within our health
care operation, and comprised approximately 93% of our total health care
segment reserves at december31, 2003; the remaining business included in
this operation is represented by claims arising out of ancillary business (such
as automobile and property coverage for our medical malpractice customers). there
were no offsetting increases or decreases in reserves of different lines within
our health care operation. of the medical malpractice reserve adjustments
recorded in 2003, approximately 17% related to 2002 incurred losses;
approximately 33% to 2001 incurred losses; approximately 23% to 2000 incurred
losses; approximately 4% to 1999 incurred losses; and the remainder of 23% to
incurred losses in 1998 and prior years. of the medical malpractice reserve
adjustments recorded in 2002, approximately 88% related to
2001 incurred losses;
approximately 50% to 2000 incurred losses; approximately (7)% to 1999 incurred
losses; approximately 6% to 1998 incurred losses; and the remainder of (37)% to
incurred losses in 1997 and prior years. of the medical malpractice reserve
adjustments recorded in 2001, approximately 29% related to 2000 incurred losses;
approximately 30% to 1999 incurred losses; approximately 15% to 1998 incurred
losses; approximately 10% to 1997 incurred losses; and the remaining 16% to
incurred losses in 1996 and prior years.
in general, the reserve increases discussed below have
primarily resulted from claim payments being greater than anticipated due to
the recent escalation of large jury awards, which included substantially higher
than expected pain and suffering awards. this affected our view of not only
those cases going to trial, but also our view of all cases where settlements
are negotiated and the threat of a large jury verdict aids the plaintiff bar in
the negotiation process. the recent escalation in claim costs in the periods
noted below that resulted from these developments was significantly higher than
originally projected trends (which had not forecasted the change in the
judicial environment), and has now been considered in our actuarial analysis
and the projection of ultimate loss costs. in addition, a portion of the reserve
increase in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted from information obtained from
the work of a health care claims task force, created during the first half of
2001, which focused resolution efforts on our largest claims with the intent of
lowering our ultimate loss costs.
the
following table summarizes, for each quarter of 2003, 2002 and 2001, our ending
net reserves for losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for our health
care segment, any prior-period reserve strengthening recorded in the quarter
(all related to the medical malpractice portion of the segment), and the
percentage such reserve strengthening represented in relation to beginning of
period total loss liability.

loss reserving process involves judgment by actuaries and management, including
evaluation not only of underlying data, but also of changes in legal, economic
and societal factors that are generally not quantifiable. such application of
judgment includes an analysis of trends that develop over time and which make
it difficult to directly correlate specific data points (as discussed
previously) with a specific reserving decision.
in the first quarter, we determined that trends that
had begun to appear in the third and fourth quarters of 2000 with respect to
the book of business of acic were outside of expected trends, resulting in
increases to our expected average case reserve outstanding and average paid
claims. within the fire& marine book of business, we also observed a
continuation of the increase in the average outstanding case reserve levels and
in the average paid claims. we believe the principal cause of these increases
was the judicial trend noted above. we revised our estimate of ultimate losses
and made a reserve addition of $90 million. in the second quarter, we
determined that the sharp increases in average paid claims and outstanding case
reserve levels during the prior quarters and the second quarter of 2001
indicated a need to increase our actuarial estimate of required reserves
(without changing our projected trends) in light of the adverse judicial awards
noted above, and we made a reserve addition of $105 million. in the third
quarter, while case reserve levels increased, the average paid claims were
within an expected level. certain of our models indicated a need for increased
reserves, while other methods, including the results of stress testing the
underlying assumptions (primarily the level of case reserves and paid
activity), indicated that reserves were appropriate in total for our health
care segment. management considered all available information and determined
that reserves were appropriate as of september30, 2001.
in the fourth quarter of 2001, we revised certain
actuarial assumptions based on the adverse trends observed in the prior three
quarters. average case reserve levels increased significantly due to our
efforts to identify cases that could be expected to have a significant impact
and manage them to closure more actively. based on the evolving trends we had
observed emerging in prior quarters, as well as escalating claim payments
observed in the fourth quarter of 2001, we concluded that average payments were
not only at a new sustained and higher level, but that they could also increase
beyond those average payments, and/or at a rate faster than inflation. we thus
concluded it was appropriate at that time to change the actuarial assumptions
we had been using in our development pattern to consider higher loss severities
and a faster rate of growth for losses. specifically, during the fourth quarter
of 2001, we adjusted our assumptions with respect to the expected ultimate incurred
and paid losses at each 12-month period from the reported loss date. these
assumptions increased the expected ultimate incurred loss from a 2% increase
over our estimated incurred at 108 months following the reported date, to a 24%
increase over estimated incurred at 12 months following the reported date. similarly,
we increased our expected ultimate paid loss assumption from a 3% increase over
our paid losses at 108 months following the reported date to a 46% increase
over our assumption of the paid losses at 12 months following the reported date.
after careful analysis and determination of development patterns and the
resulting revision of our actuarial assumptions described above, a charge to
reserves of $540 million was determined to be necessary and was recorded during
the fourth quarter of 2001.
following the cumulative prior-year reserve charges of
$735 million in 2001, activity in the first quarter of 2002 developed according
to projections. average paid claims for the full year of 2001 for medical
malpractice lines had been $117,000, including a fourth quarter average of
$124,000. the phrase average paid claims as used herein excludes claims which
were settled or closed for which no loss or loss expense was paid. in the first
quarter of 2002, the average paid loss was down to $111,000. we interpreted
this as a positive sign that prior year reserve charges up to this point had
been adequate. the average outstanding case reserve increased slightly from
$141,000 in the fourth quarter of 2001 to $144,000 in the first quarter of
2002, but this was interpreted as a relatively benign change, given inflation
and the promising decrease in average payment amounts. no additional reserve
action was taken.
in the second quarter of 2002, average paid claims for
medical malpractice lines were again somewhat above expectations, rising to
$130,000 for the quarter. this, coupled with an additional increase in the
average outstanding case
reserve to $148,000, prompted management to reflect these new increased averages
in its reserve analysis and record a reserve increase of $97 million.
throughout 2002, we initiated significant changes to
our health care claims organization and resolution process. during the third
quarter of 2002, we began to see the results of executing this strategy. specifically,
case loads per adjuster had begun to decline substantially and the process for
providing oversight on high exposure cases had been streamlined, enabling a
more expeditious approach to our handling of these medical malpractice claimsincluding
the establishment of stronger case reserves. we also added staff with expertise
in high exposure litigation management to assist claim handlers in aggressively
pursuing appropriate resolutions on a file-by-file basis. this allowed us to
establish more effective resolution strategies to either resolve claims prior
to going to trial or, for those claims deemed as non-meritorious, maintain an
aggressive defense. we also became more selective in determining which cases
are taken to trial and more willing to make use of our right to select defense
counsel in those instances that we decide to litigate. this caused our ratio of
defense verdicts to plaintiff verdicts to improve over prior years. we began to
more effectively manage our claim disposition strategies to limit the number of
catastrophic verdicts. we believe that executing this strategy increased our
ability to reduce our ultimate indemnity losses.
as noted above, as part of our focus on claim
resolution, we increased our emphasis on routinely reviewing our case reserves
and put in place a process where managers actively review each adjusters
entire inventory of pending files to assure, among other things, that case
reserves are adequate to support settlement values. in addition, as we moved
further into runoff, our mix of paid and outstanding claims changed and we
expected that our statistical data would reflect fewer new claims. we expected
our claim counts to go down and the average size of our outstanding and paid
claims to go up since newly reported claims are often settled at minimal loss
or loss expense cost.
in the third quarter of 2002, although our average
paid claim decreased slightly to $126,000, our average outstanding claim
reserve increased to $166,000. we believed that increases in the average
outstanding claim reserve was due to both the claim mix and case strengthening
as described above and was not unexpected in a runoff environment. accordingly,
we did not record any reserve charge given the favorable effects we anticipate
realizing in future ultimate payments.
in the fourth quarter of 2002, the average paid claim
increased to $153,000 and the average outstanding case reserve increased to
$181,000, which we believe was attributable to the previously described observations
and was reasonable relative to our expectations. also during the fourth
quarter, we determined that our claim inventory had been reduced considerably
and had matured to a level at which we appropriately began to consider other
more relevant data and statistics suitable for evaluating reserves in a runoff
environment.
during 2002, and as described above, we concluded that
the impact of settling claims in a runoff environment was causing abnormal
effects on our average paid claims, average outstanding claims, and the amount
of average case reserves established for new claimsall of which are
traditional statistics used by our actuaries to develop indicated ranges of
expected loss. taking these changing statistics into account, we developed
varying interpretations of our data which implied added uncertainty to our
evaluation of these reserves. it is our belief that this data, when
appropriately evaluated in light of the impact of our migration to a runoff
environment, supports our view that we will realize significant savings on our
ultimate claim costs.
in the fourth quarter of 2002, we established specific
tools and metrics to more explicitly monitor and validate our key assumptions
supporting our reserve conclusions since we believe that our traditional
statistics and reserving methods needed to be supplemented in order to provide
a more meaningful analysis. the
tools we developed track the three primary indicators which are influencing our
expectations
and
include: a) newly reported claims, b) reserve development on known claims and
c) the redundancy ratio, comparing the cost of resolving claims to the
reserve established for that individual claim.
emergence
of newly reported claimsour health care book of business was put into runoff at the
end of 2001 and our outstanding exposure rapidly dropped, as expected. since
the majority of coverage we offered was on a claims-made basis, and
notification of the claim must be made within the policy period, the potential
for unreported claims decreased significantly. we expected that the emergence
of newly reported medical malpractice claims, with incurred years of 2002 or
prior, would not exceed 40% of our current outstanding case reserve amount.
development
on known claimsas
part of executing our runoff claims strategy, the inventory of claim-specific
case reserves was reviewed during 2002 in an effort to reserve each claim as
appropriately as possible. this effort was in its advanced stages at the end of
2002, and our expectations for additional reserve strengthening on known claims
was considered to be minimal. we did not expect additional case development on
medical malpractice claims to exceed 3% of existing case reserves.
case redundancywhile there were claims settlements which
exceeded the claim-specific reserve that had been established, on the whole,
claims were being settled at a level significantly less than the individual
case reserve previously carried. during 2001, the amount of excess reserves
above settled amounts as a percentage of previously established reserves
(referred to as a redundancy ratio) were in the range of 25% to 30%. by the end
of 2002, the redundancy ratio had increased to between 35% and 40%. we expected
this ratio to stay within this range to support our best estimate of a reasonable
provision for our loss reserves.
in 2003, we evaluated the adequacy of our previously
established medical malpractice reserves in the context of the three indicators
described above. the dollar amount of newly reported claims in the first
quarter totaled $118 million, approximately 25% less than we anticipated in our
original estimate of the required level of redundancy at year-end 2002. with
regard to development on known claims, loss activity in the first quarter of
2003 was within our expectations. case development on incurred years 2001 and
prior was minimal, and case development on the 2002 incurred year totaled $39
million, within our year-end 2002 estimate of no more than 3% of development. for
the first quarter of 2003, our redundancy ratio was within our expected range
of between 35% and 40%.
in the second quarter of 2003, the dollar amount of
newly reported claims totaled $127 million, approximately 5% higher than we
anticipated in our original estimate of the required level of reserves at
year-end 2002. nevertheless, through the first half of 2003, the dollar amount
of newly reported claims was approximately 12% lower than we anticipated. loss
development on known claims during the second quarter of 2003 was negative, but
not as negative as we anticipated. our actual redundancy ratio continued to
improve in the second quarter of 2003; however, since newly reported claims and
loss development on known claims did not improve as much as we expected in the
second quarter, the required reserve redundancy had increased modestly from the
previously estimated range of 35% to 40%.
in the third quarter of 2003, the dollar amount of
newly reported claims totaled $108 million, approximately 10% higher than we
anticipated in our original estimate of the required level of reserves at
year-end 2002. however, through the first nine months of 2003, the dollar
amount of newly reported claims was approximately 7% lower than we anticipated
due to the positive variance in the first quarter. loss development on known
claims during the third quarter of 2003 was worse than anticipated. our actual
redundancy ratio continued to improve in the third quarter of 2003; however,
since newly reported claims and loss development on known claims again did not
improve as much as we expected in the third quarter, the required reserve redundancy
had increased from the previously estimated range of 35% to 40% to
approximately 45%.
in the fourth quarter of 2003, the dollar amount of
newly reported claims totaled $65 million, approximately 24% better than we
anticipated in our original estimate of the required level of reserves at
year-end 2002. the dollar amount of newly reported claims for the year ended december31,
2003 was approximately 10% better than our original expectation. we consider
the assumptions we made at the end of 2002 for newly reported claims to be
appropriate and we have made no changes to those assumptions. loss development
on known claims during the fourth quarter of 2003 was only slightly worse than
anticipated. however, through all of 2003, the cumulative development was
considerably worse than expected. through the third quarter, this adverse
development on known claims was offset by continued improvement on the actual
redundancy ratio experienced and no adjustment had been needed. however, our
actual redundancy ratio, which had continually improved during the first nine
months of 2003, took an adverse turn during novemberand december, causing
the required reserve redundancy to increase above our level of tolerance. the
view that the redundancy ratio would not only fail to continue to improve, but
could likely decay over time caused us to make an adjustment to the reserve
levels. the new required redundancy ratio, after the $350 million of reserve
strengthening recorded in the fourth quarter, is in the range of 30% to 35%.
the three indicators
described above are related such that if one deteriorates, additional
improvement on another is necessary for us to conclude that further reserve
strengthening is not necessary. the results of these indicators support our
current view that we have recorded a reasonable provision for our medical
malpractice exposures as of december31, 2003 and our analysis continues
to support our belief that we will realize favorable effects in our ultimate
costs and that our current loss reserves will prove to be a reasonable
provision.
reinsurance
in the years prior to 2002, our reinsurance segment (st.
paul re) generally underwrote treaty and facultative reinsurance for property,
liability, ocean marine, surety, certain specialty classes of coverage, and nontraditional
reinsurance, which provided limited traditional underwriting risk protection
combined with financial risk protection. in late 2001, we announced our
intention to cease underwriting certain types of reinsurance coverages and narrow
our geographic presence in 2002, as described in more detail earlier in this
discussion. as a result, in january2002, st. paul re began focusing
almost exclusively on the following types of reinsurance coverage: property
catastrophe, excess-of-loss casualty, marine and traditional finite. st. paul
re conducted its business through four business centers: north american
casualty, north american property, international and finite risk. as discussed
in more detail earlier in this report, in november2002, we transferred
our ongoing reinsurance operations to platinum underwriters holdings, ltd. (platinum)
while retaining liabilities generally for reinsurance contracts incepting prior
to january1, 2002. reported results for our reinsurance operation in 2003
represent premium adjustments and loss development on reinsurance business
underwritten prior to the transfer of business to platinum. reported results
for 2002 include those elements, as well as activity from the period january1,
2002 up to the date of transfer to platinum.
2003the underwriting profit of $3 million in 2003 was
driven by $8 million of favorable development on prior-year loss reserves
related to the september11, 2001 terrorist attack. results in 2003 also
included a $6 million underwriting loss related to the transfer of additional
assets and reserves to platinum pursuant to an adjustment mechanism as
described in more detail earlier in this report.
2002 vs. 2001the
significant decline in written premium volume in 2002 compared with 2001 was
primarily due to reduced volume from the lines of business targeted for exit at
the end of 2001. also contributing to the decline in premium volume in 2002 was
the rescission of several large reinsurance contracts, which reduced written
premiums by $137 million. in addition, st. paul re ceded written premiums of
$158 million in the fourth quarter related to the transfer of business to
platinum, representing unearned premiums as of the date of transfer on business
incepting subsequent to january1, 2002. these
reductions in premiums
were partially offset by significant price increases on the narrowed lines of
business underwritten in 2002 prior to the transfer to platinum, and new
business in the accident and health reinsurance market.
st. paul res underwriting loss of $22 million in 2002
included a $40 million detriment from aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance
treaties, primarily related to the commutation of a portion of one aggregate
excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty that was exclusive to our reinsurance
operations. the 2002 result also included $23 million of losses related to the september11,
2001 terrorist attack, which were partially offset by favorable loss experience
on business underwritten in 2002, driven by significant price increases and benefits
derived from exiting unprofitable lines of business. catastrophe and other
weather-related losses in 2002 totaled $31 million, comprised primarily of
losses associated with flooding in europe in august. the underwriting loss of
$726 million in 2001 was dominated by $556 million of losses related to the september11,
2001 terrorist attack. other catastrophe and weather-related losses of $66
million in 2001 were driven by losses from the explosion of a chemical plant in
france and tropical storm allison in the united states. the remainder of
underwriting losses in 2001 were concentrated in north american casualty and
property reinsurance business.
other runoff
this category includes the results of the following
international insurance operations: 1) our runoff operations at lloyds,
primarily consisting of the following lines of business written through four
syndicates, across which our ownership ranged from 54% to 100% and which ceased
underwriting in 2001 or the first quarter of 2002: casualty insurance and
reinsurance, non-marine reinsurance, professional liability insurance
(particularly for financial customers, and directors and officers liability
insurance) and our participation in the insuring of the lloyds central fund;
2) unionamerica, the london-based underwriting unit acquired as part of our
purchase of mmi in 2000. unionamerica underwrote liability and property
coverages, including medical malpractice and other professional liability and
directors and officers liability, both inside and outside of lloyds, on both
an insurance and excess-of-loss reinsurance basis; 3) all other international
runoff lines of business we decided to exit at the end of 2001, consisting of
health care business in the united kingdom, canada and ireland, as well as our
underwriting operations in germany, france, the netherlands, argentina, mexico
(excluding surety business), spain, australia, new zealand, botswana and south
africa. (in 2003, we sold our operations in botswana, and in 2002, we sold our
operations in argentina, mexico and spain); and 4) the results of our
participation in voluntary insurance pools, as well as loss development on
business underwritten prior to 1980 (prior to 1988 for business acquired in our
merger with usf&g corporation in 1998). we have a management team in place
for the operations comprising this category to ensure that our outstanding
claim obligations are settled in an expeditious and economical manner.
2003 vs.2002despite
placing all of the operations in this category in runoff at the beginning of
2002, we continue to underwrite business in selected markets while we attempt
to sell certain of those operations, accounting for the $60 million of premium
volume in 2003. the $374 million underwriting loss included $285 million in provisions
to strengthen prior-year loss reserves and $89 million of current year losses
and underwriting expenses.
lloyds accounted for $159 million of the underwriting
loss in 2003, driven by $108 million of adverse loss development on business
written in prior years and poor current-year results from north american
liability business, and financial and professional business, as well as an
increase in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance. (the elimination of
the one-quarter reporting lag for our operations at lloyds accounted for $48
million of our reported underwriting loss for lloyds in this category in 2003).
unionamericas underwriting loss in 2003 of $104 million included $67 million
of adverse prior year loss development and a $21 million increase in the
provision for uncollectible reinsurance, with the remainder reflecting current
year losses related to strengthened loss assumptions on contracts still in
effect in 2003.
these current year losses
are centered in three lines of business underwritten through the lloyds market
that are now managed by unionamerica: insurance of non-u.s. medical
malpractice, excess-of-loss reinsurance of directors and officers liability
business, and u.s. surplus lines business. all other international runoff lines
of business accounted for $58 million of underwriting losses in 2003, compared
with $56 million of losses in 2002. the underwriting loss on domestic lines underwritten
prior to 1980 (prior to 1988 for business acquired in our merger with usf&g
corporation in 1998) was $53 million, the majority of which was comprised of
$46 million of adverse prior year development primarily attributable to an
increase in asbestos reserves during the fourth quarter of 2003. adverse prior-year
reserve development of $43million in our other international lines occurred
throughout the year in various lines of business and in various increments.

2002 vs.2001the significant decline in
written premium volume in 2002 reflected the impact of our decision to place
these businesses in runoff. international runoff lines of business accounted
for $110 million of written premium volume in 2002, down 54% from $240 million
in 2001. we continued to underwrite business in selected markets while we
attempted to sell certain of our operations. our lloyds runoff premium totaled
$114 million in 2002, compared with $253 million in 2001. unionamerica
syndicate premium volume totaled $18 million in 2002, down significantly from
2001 premiums of $99 million.
lloyds accounted for $99 million of the underwriting
loss in 2002, driven by adverse loss development on business written in prior
years and poor current-year results from north american liability and
reinsurance business. unionamericas underwriting loss in 2002 of $60 million
included $27 million of adverse prior year loss development, with the remainder
reflecting current year losses related to strengthened loss assumptions related
to contracts still in effect in 2002. these losses are centered in three lines
of business underwritten through lloyds syndicates that are now managed by
unionamerica: excess-of-loss reinsurance on u.s. medical malpractice, directors
and officers liability business, and u.s. surplus lines business. all other
international runoff lines of business accounted for $56 million of
underwriting losses in 2002, compared with $94 million of losses in 2001. losses
in 2002 were centered in the netherlands and spain, whereas in 2001 losses were
concentrated in health care business and construction coverages offered in the
united kingdom. the decline in these other international runoff losses in 2002
reflected the impact of our decision to withdraw from those markets.

portfolio of fixed income investments is primarily composed of high-quality,

and tax-exempt u.s. municipal bonds. we manage this portfolio conservatively,
investing almost exclusively in investment-grade securities.
at december31, 2003, approximately 96% of our
fixed income portfolio, comprised of our fixed income securities, the
securities on loan and short-term investments, was rated investment grade. approximately
3% consisted of non-investment grade securities and 1% were non-rated
securities.
we participate in a securities lending program whereby
certain fixed income securities from our portfolio are loaned to other
institutions for short periods of time. we receive a fee from the borrower in
return. we require collateral equal to 102% of the fair value of the loaned
securities, and we record the cash collateral received as a liability. the
collateral is invested in short-term investments and reported as such on our
balance sheet. the carrying value of the securities on loan is removed from
fixed income securities on the balance sheet and shown as a separate investment
asset. we continue to earn interest on the securities on loan, and earn a
portion of the interest related to the short-term investments.
at the end of 2003, the reported amortized cost of our
fixed income portfolio was $15.6 billion, compared with $16.1 billion at the
end of 2002. the decline was primarily due to our increased
participation in the
securities lending program described above and the resulting reclassification
of those securities to a separate balance sheet caption. we carry these
securities on our balance sheet at fair value, with the appreciation or
depreciation recorded in shareholders equity, net of taxes. the fair values of
our bonds fluctuate with changes in market interest rates, changes in yield
differentials between fixed income asset classes and changes in the perceived
creditworthiness of corporate obligors. at the end of 2003, the pretax
unrealized appreciation of our fixed income portfolio was $862 million,
compared with unrealized appreciation of $1.0 billion at the end of 2002, with
the decline due to higher market interest rates in 2003. the 10-year u.s.
treasury yield rose 43 basis points during 2003. in 2002, by contrast, that
same u.s. treasury yield declined by 123 basis points, causing a significant
increase in the unrealized appreciation of the portfolio over year-end 2001.
our decision whether to purchase taxable or tax-exempt
securities is driven by corporate tax considerations, and the relationship
between taxable and tax-exempt yields at the time of purchase. in recent years,
the availability of corporate net operating loss carryforwards and alternative
minimum tax carryforwards has increased our ability to benefit from taxable
investment income. accordingly, a significant majority of our new fixed income
purchases in recent years have consisted of taxable bonds. the average yield on
taxable bonds purchased in 2003 was 4.5%, compared with 5.3% in 2002 and 6.5%
in 2001. the decline of these average investment yields in both 2003 and 2002
reflected the impact of the federal reserve rate actions and general economic
weakness. taxable bonds accounted for 77% of our fixed income portfolio at
year-end 2003, compared with 75% at the end of 2002. the bond portfolio in
total carried a weighted average pretax yield of 5.7% at december31,
2003, compared with 6.2% at the end of 2002.
pretax investment income generated by our fixed income
securities, securities on loan and short-term investments in 2003 totaled $1.02
billion, down 7% from 2002 investment income of $1.09 billion. our investment
income in 2003 was negatively impacted by yields on new investments purchased
during the last several years, which were significantly lower than yields on
investments that matured in those years. in addition, significant loss and loss
adjustment expense payments, including payments related to our runoff
operations and the $747 million western macarthur asbestos settlement payment,
prevented significant growth in our invested asset base during 2003. in 2002,
pretax investment income from fixed income investments was 1% below 2001 income
of $1.11 billion. the effect of the decline in yields available on new
investments in 2002 was substantially offset by an increase in funds invested,
largely due to the capital infusion and sales of equity investments.
additional information regarding our fixed income
portfolio is disclosed in the critical
accounting policies section of this discussion.
real estate and mortgage loansreal estate ($775 million) and mortgage loans ($63 million)
accounted for 4% of our total property-liability investments at the end of 2003.
our real estate holdings primarily consist of commercial office and warehouse
properties that we own directly or in which we have a partial interest through
joint ventures. our properties are geographically distributed throughout the
united states and had an occupancy rate of 89.7% at year-end 2003, compared
with 89.9% in 2002. real estate investments produced pretax investment income
of $61 million in 2003, compared with $67 million in 2002. our real estate
investment cash flows of $106 million in 2003 were slightly higher than cash
flows of $105 million in 2002. these cash flows equated to cash yields of 10.8%
and 10.4% for 2003 and 2002, respectively. we made no significant real estate
purchases in 2003 or 2002.
we acquired our portfolio of mortgage loans in the
1998 merger with usf&g. the loans, which are collateralized by
income-producing real estate, produced investment income of $6 million in 2003
and $10 million in 2002. net pay downs and repayments of the loans totaled $19
million in 2003 and $52 million in 2002. we did not originate any new loans in
either of the last two years.
venture capitalventure
capital comprised 2% of our property-liability invested assets (at cost) at the
end of 2003. these private investments span a variety of industries but are
concentrated in telecommunications, information technology, health care and
consumer products. in 2003, we invested $134 million in this asset class,
compared with $138 million in 2002. our total return on average net venture
capital investments (encompassing dividend income, realized gains and losses,
and the change in unrealized appreciation) was 12.3% in 2003, (41.0%) in 2002
and (41.5%) in 2001. the positive return in 2003 was driven by net pretax
realized investment gains of $51 million, the components of which are described
in more detail below. venture capital returns in 2002 and 2001 were negatively
impacted by significant declines in the unrealized appreciation of our
investments. additionally in 2002, losses from investments sales and impairment
write-downs were significant, as described in more detail below. the carrying
value of the venture capital portfolio at year-end 2003 and 2002 included
unrealized appreciation of $24 million and $4 million, respectively.
at december31, 2003, we had long-term commitments
to fund venture capital investments totaling $792 million which are subject to
certain termination provisions as further described in note 16 to the
consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
equitiesour
equity holdings consist of a diversified portfolio of public common stock,
comprising less than 1% of total property-liability investments (at cost) at
year-end 2003. in mid-2002, we began to reduce our level of equity investments.
our decision was prompted by several factors, including our opinion as to the
near-term direction of equity prices, a comprehensive evaluation of our
aggregate equity exposure (including venture capital and equities held by our
pension fund), and our opinion as to the level of public equity investments
that is appropriate for publicly held insurance companies. by the end of 2003,
we had reduced our equity investments by $953 million (at cost) since year-end
2001.
the total return on our combined domestic and
international equity portfolio was 32% in 2003, compared with (19.4%) in 2002
and (20.7%) in 2001. at the end of 2003, the market value of our remaining
portfolio of $105 million exceeded its cost by $17 million. by comparison, at
the end of 2002, the $375 million cost of our equity holdings exceeded its
market value by $20 million.
other investmentsour
14% equity ownership stake in platinum underwriters holdings, ltd., with a
carrying value of $146 million and $129 million, at december31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, is included in this category, as is a long-term
interest-bearing security from a highly-rated entity, supporting a series of
insurance transactions, with a carrying value of $359 million and $386 million
at december31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the carrying value of this security
is expected to continue to decline in proportion to the reduction in the amount
of insurance which it supports. also included in other investments are our
warrants to purchase additional platinum shares, which are carried at their
market value ($65 million and $61 million at december31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively).

2003.
during 2003, we sold fixed
income securities with a cumulative amortized cost of $940 million, generating
gross pretax gains of $39 million. these gains were partially offset by
impairment write-downs totaling $17 million, including $9 million related to
asset/mortgage backed securities and $4 million related to healthsouth
corporation. we recorded additional impairment write-downs totaling $4 million
in our fixed income portfolio during 2003 related to nine other issuers. each
of these write-downs was carried out by writing our stated book value down to
our estimate of net realizable value. we continued to reduce our equity
investment holdings in 2003, and sales of those investments in a rebounding
market environment resulted in net pretax gains of $40 million for the year. impairment
write-downs in our equity portfolio totaled $6 million in 2003. in our venture
capital portfolio, the sale of a large portion of one of our investment
holdings generated a pretax gain of $171 million in 2003, which was largely
offset by impairment realized losses totaling $143 million related to 38 of our
investment holdings. fourteen of those holdings were impaired due to a merger
or sale at a value less than our cost. eleven holdings experienced fundamental
economic deterioration (characterized by gross margins being less than
expected, product pricing not meeting initial projections due to market
conditions, and greater than expected manufacturing expenses). six holdings
were written down because the entities progress was substantially less than
planned and additional financing was required at values less than our cost. an
additional six holdings were impaired due to cessation of operations of the
entity. finally, one holding was impaired because market demand for its product
was less than expected.
2002.
during 2002, we sold fixed income securities with a
cumulative amortized cost of $2.5 billion, generating gross pretax gains of
$185 million. these gains were partially offset by impairment write-downs
totaling $74 million, including $15 million related to our investment in debt
securities issued by worldcom corporation, $13 million related to txu eastern funding
and $10 million related to nrg energy. we recorded additional impairment
write-downs totaling $36 million in our fixed income portfolio during 2002
related to 22 other issuers. those write-downs resulted from bankruptcy filings
or substantial deterioration in the financial condition of those issuers. realized losses from our equity portfolio in
2002 primarily consisted of those resulting from sales following the strategic
decision to re-allocate funds to the fixed maturity portfolio, and impairment
write-downs totaling $26 million.
in our venture capital
portfolio, realized losses in 2002 included $56 million of losses resulting
from the sale of the majority of our partnership investment holdings, and
impairment write-downs in 25 of our holdings totaling $122 million. these
holdings were impaired for the same general reasons noted above for the 2003
impairments: seven holdings were impaired because market demand for their
products was less than expected; seven holdings were written down because the entities
progress was less than planned and additional financing would be required; five
holdings were impaired due to fundamental economic deterioration (as defined
above); four holdings were impaired due to a merger or sale at less than our
cost; and two holdings were impaired due to cessation of operations.
2001.
pretax realized losses in the fixed income category in
2001 were driven by write-downs in the carrying value of certain of our bond
holdings, including a $20 million write-down of various argentina government
and corporate bonds following economic upheaval in that country, and a $19
million write-down in debt securities issued by enron corporation following
that companys bankruptcy filing. we recorded additional impairment write-downs
totaling $38 million in our fixed income portfolio during 2001 related to 19
other issuers. we did not record any impairment write-downs in our equity
portfolio in 2001. realized losses in our venture capital portfolio primarily
resulted from impairment write-downs, which in the aggregate
totaled $88 million,
related to 31 of our direct venture capital investments. these holdings were
impaired for the same reasons described above for 2003 and 2002.
for publicly-traded securities in our venture capital
portfolio in each year, the amounts of write-downs were determined by writing
our investments down to quoted market prices. for non-publicly-traded
securities, the write-downs to estimated net realizable value were reviewed and
approved by our internal valuation committee, which, on a quarterly basis,
evaluates recent financings, operating results, balance sheet stability,
growth, and other business and sector fundamentals in determining fair values
of the specific investments. on an ongoing basis, our venture capital portfolio
managers monitor the activities of both our publicly-traded and
non-publicly-traded securities, keeping in mind developments that might give
rise to necessary valuation adjustments. these managers may report any such
developments to the internal valuation committee.
a significant amount of
additional information regarding procedures employed to evaluate other than
temporary impairments in the carrying value of any of our investments is
contained in the critical accounting
policies section of this discussion.
property-liability
underwriting
loss and loss
adjustment expense reserves
our loss reserves reflect estimates of total losses
and loss adjustment expenses we will ultimately have to pay under insurance
policies, surety bonds and reinsurance agreements. these include losses that
have been reported but not settled, and losses that have been incurred but not
yet reported to us (ibnr). loss reserves for certain workers compensation
business and certain assumed reinsurance contracts are discounted to present
value. we reduce our loss reserves for estimates of salvage and subrogation.
for reported losses, we establish reserves on a case
basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy,
surety bond or reinsurance agreement. for ibnr losses, we estimate reserves
using established actuarial methods. our case and ibnr reserve estimates
consider such variables as past loss experience, changes in legislative
conditions, changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability and policy
coverages, and inflation. we consider not only monetary increases in the cost
of what we insure, but also changes in societal factors that influence jury
verdicts and case law and, in turn, claim costs.
because many of the coverages we offer involve claims
that may not ultimately be settled for many years after they are incurred,
subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and
necessary component of our loss reserving process. we record our reserves by
considering a range of estimates bounded by a high and low point. within that
range, we record our best estimate. we continually review our reserves, using a
variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claim costs,
frequency and severity data, and prevailing economic, social and legal factors.
we adjust reserves established in prior years as loss experience develops and
new information becomes available. adjustments to previously estimated reserves
are reflected in our financial results in the periods in which they are made.
while our reported reserves make
a reasonable provision for all of our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense
obligations, it is important to note that the process of estimating required
reserves does, by its very nature, involve uncertainty. the level of
uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the existence of long tail
coverage forms and changes in claim handling practices. many of our insurance
subsidiaries have written long-tail coverages such as medical professional
liability, large deductible workers compensation and assumed reinsurance. in
addition, claim handling practices change and evolve over the years. for
example, new initiatives are commenced, claim offices are reorganized and
relocated, claim handling responsibilities of individual adjusters are changed,
use of a call center is increased, use of technology is increased, caseload
issues and case reserving practices are monitored more frequently, etc.
however,
these are sources of uncertainty that we have recognized and for which we have
appropriately reserved.
the
following table summarizes the composition of our gross and net loss and loss
adjustment expense reserves by major product line as of december31, 2003
and 2002. our loss and lae reserves related to our foreign operations are
presented in total in the table, as those operations do not classify their
business using the same product line definitions as our domestic operations.

analysis of our
long-tail exposures
we consider long-tail exposures to include those
lines of business in which the majority of coverage involves average loss
payment lags of three years or more beyond the expiration of the policy and,
accordingly, can cause an increased level of uncertainty in estimating loss
reserves. the primary lines of our business fitting those criteria are general
liability, workers compensation, and casualty excess reinsurance. for the medical
malpractice business we underwrote prior to our exit from that line of
business, reserves do not exceed a three-year average life, but do involve a
high degree of uncertainty. we analyze these reserves in accordance with our
accounting policy as further described in the critical accounting policies
section of this discussion.
the following table provides additional statistics on
our long tail and medical malpractice exposures and is followed by discussion
on known trends, events, or uncertainties that may affect our future results of
operations or financial condition. we also further describe the nature of the
underlying claims, including relevant information of the claimant population. for
our general liability and workers compensation lines of business, we have
reported separately our exposures to possible environmental and asbestos (e&a)
obligations. for our non-e&a general liability, workers compensation, and
medical malpractice coverages, we have included data only for our primary
domestic insurance operations, excluding alternative risk transfer insurance
products. the coverages in the table represented approximately 65% of
our total net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december31,
2003.

(1) the claim counts included
in this table represent counts of supplements, which are extracted from our
actuarial databases. a claim supplement is the finest level of detail recorded
in our statistical systems. for example, two claimants for a single general
liability bodily injury occurrence would be counted as two separate supplements.
our claim department manages claims on a policyholder basis, while the data in
this table is presented on a claim count basis. for environmental and asbestos
claims, a claim supplement count does not reflect the number of claimants
involved on the account. for asbestos claims, supplements are generally created
based on the number of policy years potentially implicated on the account. for
environmental claims, supplements are generally created to track the number of
sites involved on the account.
(2) the environmental and
asbestos claim count information includes only losses on direct written
business whereas the paid loss data on assumed business, presented separately,
includes loss and
defense and cost
containment expenses. claim count data is not shown on losses assumed from
other companies and/or insurance pools because we are often either covering a
very small portion of any one claim, or a number of claims which are compiled
together as one for reporting purposes and, therefore, such statistics would
not be meaningful. also, the costs to administer these claims do not include
adjusting and other related payments.
(3) includes property and
casualty loss experience since casualty only is not available. also, claim
counts are not available on assumed reinsurance. loss settlement amounts
include defense and cost containment expenses whereas costs to administer
include only adjusting and other related payments.
general liability (non-e&a)includes
insurance coverage protecting the insured against legal liability resulting
from negligence, carelessness, or failure to act causing property damage or
personal injury to others. claims on these coverages are usually paid to third
party claimants. while we offer coverage that may result in low-frequency,
high-severity claims (i.e. excess umbrella, large accounts), the majority of
the non-e&a general liability business is generally stable and predictable
due to the volume of business written. although the cost of administering these
claims comprises a large portion of the overall claim cost, the actual average
loss payment per claim is generally low. the most significant risk for this
line is unexpected increases in inflation, either economic or social. the number
of newly reported claims continued to decline in 2003 driven by an underlying
decrease in our exposure to loss. premiums have increased in the last several
years due to pricing, but the actual number of exposures insured has dropped. paid
losses and closed claims declined in 2003 due to a decrease in reported claims
in recent years. the increase in paid dollars in 2002 was the result of closing
more claims in 2002 than we did in 2001.
workers compensationincludes
insurance which covers an employers liability for injuries, disability or
death to persons in their employment, without regard to fault. the coverage provided under the workers
compensation policies is based on state-specific schedules for wage replacement
and medical payments for injured workers. while the largest portion of the
workers insured under our policies generate a very low severity body of claims,
a portion of our premium volume is generated in our construction business
center, where there is an increased possibility of permanent and total
disability requiring lifetime payments. although each state government can make
changes in coverage, the changes happen after considerable public deliberation
and very seldom will impact policies that have been sold in the past. the
number of newly reported claims continued to decline in 2003, driven by an
underlying decrease in our exposure to loss. premiums have increased in the
last several years due to pricing, but the actual number of exposures insured
has dropped. the number of claims closed in 2003 declined due to a steadily
decreasing number of reported claims in recent years. we closed roughly as many
claims in 2002 as in 2001, driving the number of pending claims down.
medical malpracticeincludes
insurance protecting a licensed health care provider or health care facility
against legal liability resulting from death or injury of any person due to the
insureds misconduct, negligence, or incompetence in rendering professional
services. medical malpractice claims are volatile in nature. while a large
number are closed without a loss payment, those with payments may be very large
depending on the circumstances and judicial climate. significant cost is
expended in the settlement of these claims, often with favorable outcomes. since
this book of business is in runoff, the pending inventory is decreasing and
will begin to distort some of the statistics. as the runoff matures, there will
be fewer small claims and fewer meritless claims that can be quickly dismissed.
the single largest risk in this line of business is associated with social
trends in jury verdicts which is described in further detail in our health care
segment discussion in this report. as
reported in the health care discussion referenced above, newly reported claim
counts are dropping quickly as we exit this business segment. as we execute our
runoff strategy, we will continue to see a drop in the inventory of pending
claims. the unusually high number of claims reported and dismissed, settled
or resolved in 2001 in the foregoing table was due to the impact of the mmi
integration.
environmentalthis exposure
relates to general liability coverage on policies which may be interpreted to
cover environmental-related exposures. the information presented above
represents business reported as not underwritten environmental losses as described
in the following section of this report. payment totals for these coverages are
driven by a few very large claims, accompanied by a large number of very small
claims. while the number of new reported claims appears to increase, they are
primarily matters for which there is no expectation of claim payment, or for
policies that have not been identified as cases where the underwriter intended
coverage. a significant portion of the cost of administering these claims
relates to claims that are eventually settled without payment. changes in
social, judicial, legislative and economic conditions could result in future
unforeseen developments and require reserve adjustments.
asbestosthis exposure relates to
general liability and workers compensation coverages on policies which can be
interpreted to cover asbestos-related exposures. this portion of business is
defined as that which is reported as asbestos losses as described in more
detail in the following section of this report. amounts are driven by a few very
large claims, accompanied by a large number of very small claims or claims made
with no payment. a significant portion of the cost of administering the claims
is spent on those claims that are eventually settled without payment. social,
judicial, legislative and economic changes could result in future unforeseen
developments and require reserve adjustments. western macarthur accounted for
the majority of paid losses on settled claims in 2003 ($453 million) and 2002
($173 million), as well as the majority of costs to administer in 2002 ($12
million), with the remainder relating to claims made in prior years. approximately
32% and 25% of the pending general liability asbestos claim supplements as of december31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, came from policyholders who tendered their first
asbestos claim within three years of those respective dates. the increase in
newly reported claims arise from policyholders who tendered their first claim
to us within the last three years. for example, approximately 73% of the
general liability claim supplements reported during 2003 came from
policyholders who tendered their first claim after january1, 2001. these
claims are generally relatively small and have, to date, presented minimal
exposure.
assumed
reinsurancethis portion of our business represents our
reported reinsurance segment and includes property and liability loss exposures
assumed on both a proportional and excess of loss basis. there are both low
frequency, high severity exposures as well as some event-driven high-severity
exposures. a significant portion of the high exposure business was catastrophe
related. as of november2, 2002, we were no longer significantly exposed
to subsequent events due to the transfer of our ongoing reinsurance operations
to platinum underwriters holdings, ltd. although our property exposure
(included in this data) is not considered long tail, our casualty exposure is
considered long tail andsimilar to our primary general liability exposuresis
sensitive to the risk of unexpected increases in inflation. the larger loss
settlement amounts from 2001 through 2003 were primarily due to losses
resulting from the september11, 2001 terrorist attack.
prior-year loss
development
note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements includes a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss
and loss adjustment expense reserves for each of the years 2003, 2002 and 2001.
that reconciliation shows that we recorded an increase in the loss provision
from continuing operations for claims incurred in prior years totaling $646
million in 2003, $1.0 billion in 2002 and $577 million in 2001.
our runoff health care operation
accounted for $350 million of the total 2003 prior-year provision, and our other
runoff operations accounted for $285 million of the prior-year provision. we
recorded $25 million of favorable prior-year loss development in our runoff
reinsurance operations. of the 2002 total, $472 million resulted from the
settlement of the western macarthur asbestos litigation, as described in more
detail earlier in this discussion. the majority of the remaining 2002 prior
year development was concentrated in our health care, surety, construction, and
other operations. the increase in prior-year
loss
provisions in 2001 was driven by additional losses in our health care operation.
that development in all three years is discussed in detail in the respective
segment sections included herein.
the
following table summarizes the composition of our gross and net loss and loss
adjustment expense reserves, and the net unfavorable (favorable) prior-year
loss development by segment as of december31, 2003.

property-liability
underwriting
environmental and
asbestos claims
we continue to receive claims, including through
lawsuits, alleging injury or damage from environmental pollution or seeking
payment for the cost to clean up polluted sites. we also receive asbestos
injury claims, including through lawsuits, arising out of coverages under
general liability policies. most of these claims arise from policies written
many years ago. significant legal issues, primarily pertaining to the scope of
coverage, complicate the determination of our alleged liability for both
environmental and asbestos claims. in our opinion, court decisions in certain
jurisdictions have tended to broaden insurance coverage for both environmental
and asbestos matters beyond the intent of the original insurance policies.
our ultimate liability for environmental claims is
difficult to estimate because of these legal issues. insured parties have
submitted claims for losses that in our view are not covered in their
respective insurance policies, and the final resolution of these claims may be
subject to lengthy litigation, making it difficult to estimate our potential
liability. in addition, variables such as the length of time necessary to clean
up a polluted site, and controversies surrounding the identity of the
responsible party and the degree of remediation deemed necessary, make it difficult
to estimate the total cost of an environmental claim.
estimating our ultimate liability for asbestos claims
is also very difficult. the primary factors influencing our estimate of the
total cost of these claims are case law and a history of prior claim
development, both of which
continue to evolve and are complicated by aggressive litigation against
insurers, including us. estimating ultimate liability is also complicated by
the difficulty of assessing what rights, if any, we may have to seek contribution
from other insurers of any policyholder.
late in 2001, we hired a new executive vice president
of claims, with extensive experience with environmental and asbestos claims
handling and environmental and asbestos reserves, who conducted a summary level
review of our environmental and asbestos reserves. as a result of observations
made in this review, we undertook more detailed actuarial and claims analyses
of environmental reserves. no adjustment to reserves was made in the fourth
quarter of 2001, since management did not have a sufficient basis for making an
adjustment until such supplemental analyses were completed, and we believed our
environmental and asbestos reserves were adequate as of december31, 2001.
our historical methodology (through first quarter
2002) for reviewing the adequacy of environmental and asbestos reserves
utilized a survival ratio metric, which considers ending reserves in relation
to calendar year paid losses. when the environmental reserve analyses were
completed in the second quarter of 2002, we supplemented our survival ratio
diagnostics with the detailed additional analyses referred to above, and
concluded that our environmental reserves were redundant by approximately $150
million. based on our additional analyses, we released approximately $150
million of environmental reserves in the second quarter of 2002. had we
continued to rely solely on our analysis of survival ratio, we would have
recorded no adjustment to our environmental reserves through the six months
ended june30, 2002.
in the second quarter of 2002, we also supplemented
our survival ratio analysis of asbestos reserves with a detailed claims
analysis. we determined that, excluding the impact of the western macarthur
settlement, our asbestos reserves were adequate; however, including that
impact, we determined that our asbestos reserves were inadequate.
in the fourth quarter of 2003, we updated our detailed
actuarial analysis for both asbestos and environmental reserves pertaining to
our exposure from direct policyholders and relied more heavily on these
analyses in determining the adequacy of our reserve provision for the remaining
unreported losses. for non-workers compensation asbestos claims we
supplemented this detailed analysis with an additional analysis to determine an
estimate of reserves specifically for policyholders who have not as yet
tendered their first asbestos claim. as a result of these studies we increased
net asbestos reserves by $77 million ($44 million in our ongoing operations and
$33 million in our runoff operations) and net environmental reserves by $14
million (all in our ongoing operations). in addition, reviews of assumed and
non-domestic exposures caused us to increase net asbestos reserves by $13
million and reduce net environmental reserves by $1 million (all of which was
recorded in our runoff operations).
as a result of developments in the asbestos litigation
environment generally, we determined in the first quarter of 2002 that it would
be desirable to seek earlier and ultimately less costly resolutions of certain
pending asbestos-related litigations. as a result, we have decided where
possible to seek to resolve these matters while continuing to vigorously assert
defenses in pending litigations. we are taking a similar approach to environmental
litigations. as discussed in more detail earlier in this report, in the second
quarter of 2002 we entered into a definitive agreement to settle asbestos
claims for a total gross cost of $995 million arising from any insuring
relationship we and certain of our subsidiaries may have had with macarthur
company, western macarthur company or western asbestos company.
the table below represents a reconciliation of total
gross and net environmental reserve development for each of the years in the
three-year period ended december31, 2003. amounts in the net column are
reduced by reinsurance recoverables. the disclosure of environmental reserve
development includes all claims related to environmental exposures. additional
disclosure has been provided to separately identify loss payments and reserve
amounts related to policies that were specifically underwritten to cover
environmental exposures, referred to as underwritten, as well as amounts
related to environmental exposures that were not specifically underwritten,
referred to as not underwritten. in
1988, we
completed our
implementation of a pollution exclusion in our commercial general liability
policies; therefore, activity related to accident years after 1988 generally
relates to policies underwritten to include environmental exposures.
the amounts presented for paid losses in the following
table as underwritten include primarily exposures related to accident years
after 1988 for policies which the underwriter contemplated providing
environmental coverage. in addition, certain pre-1988 exposures, primarily
first party losses, are included since, they too, were contemplated by the
underwriter to include environmental coverage. not underwritten primarily
represents exposures related to accident years 1988 and prior for policies
which were not contemplated by the underwriter to include environmental
coverage.

* the $150
million reduction of environmental reserves discussed previously was included
in both the gross and net incurred losses for 2002.
for the year 2001, the gross and net environmental underwritten
reserves at the beginning of the year totaled $27 million and $26 million,
respectively, and at the end of the year both totaled $28 million. for 2002,
the year-end gross and net environmental underwritten reserves were both $36
million, and at december31, 2003 the gross reserves were $37 million and
net reserves were $36 million. these reserves relate to policies that were
specifically underwritten to include environmental exposures. these underwritten
reserve amounts are included in the total reserve amounts in the preceding
table.
the
following table represents a reconciliation of total gross and net reserve
development for asbestos claims for each of the years in the three-year period

gross paid losses in 2003 include the $747 million
payment, inclusive of $7 million in interest, made in the first quarter
pursuant to the western macarthur litigation settlement agreement. western
macarthur accounted for $9 million of gross incurred losses in 2003. included
in gross incurred losses in 2002 (including the $150 million reserve increase)
were $995 million of losses related to the western macarthur agreement. also
included in the gross and net incurred losses for the year ended december31,
2002, but
reported separately in the
above table, was a $150 million increase in asbestos reserves. gross paid
losses include the $248 million western macarthur payment made in june2002.
our reserves for
environmental and asbestos losses at december31, 2003 represent our best
estimate of our ultimate liability for such losses, based on all information
currently available. because of the inherent difficulty in estimating such
losses, however, we cannot give assurances that our ultimate liability for
environmental and asbestos losses will, in fact, match current reserves. we
continue to evaluate new information and developing loss patterns, as well as
the potential impact of our determination to seek earlier and ultimately less
costly resolutions of certain pending asbestos and environmental related
litigations. future changes in our estimates of our ultimate liability for
environmental and asbestos claims may be material to our results of operations,
but we do not believe they will materially impact our liquidity or overall
financial position.
total gross environmental
and asbestos reserves at december31, 2003, of $803 million represented
approximately 4% of gross consolidated reserves of $19.4 billion.

generate three principal sources of revenue: (1)advisory fees earned on
assets under management, including separately managed accounts, exchange-traded
funds and mutual funds; (2)underwriting and distribution revenues earned
upon the sale of certain investment products and (3)performance fees
earned on certain institutional accounts based on the performance of such
accounts. advisory fees accounted for 90%, 90% and 88% of nuveen investments
total revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
acquisitionsin
august2002, nuveen investments acquired nwq investment management company,inc.
(nwq), an asset management firm based in los angeles with approximately $6.9
billion of assets under management in both retail and institutional managed
accounts at the time of the acquisition. nwq specializes in value-oriented
equity investments and has significant relationships among institutions and
financial advisors. the nwq purchase price included up to an additional $20
million payable to the seller over a five-year period under terms of a
strategic alliance agreement, of which $2.5 million was paid in 2003. the
purchase price was funded through a combination of available cash and
borrowings under an intercompany credit facility between the st. paul and
nuveen investments.
in july2001,
nuveen investments acquired symphony asset management llc (symphony), an
institutional investment manager based in san francisco with approximately $4
billion in assets under management at the time of the acquisition. the
acquisition of symphony expanded nuveen investments product offerings to
include managed accounts and funds designed to reduce risk through
market-neutral and other strategies for institutional investors.
2003 vs. 2002gross investment product sales in
2003 totaled a record $18.1 billion, 16% higher than 2002 product sales of
$15.6 billion. net flows (equal to the sum of sales, reinvestments and
exchanges, less redemptions) were $9.4 billion in 2003, over $2 billion higher
than 2002 net flows of $7.3 billion. net flows were positive across all product
linesmanaged accounts, closed-end exchange-traded products and mutual funds. investor
demand in 2003 continued to be strong for municipal investments and
high-quality taxable income-oriented investments. nuveen investments raised
$5.7 billion during the year through new closed-end exchange-traded funds that
blend various stock and bond investment strategies. with the rebound of equity
markets and investors renewed interest in equity investing, nuveen investments
equity sales grew 45% over 2002 to $6.4 billion. the success nuveen investments
has achieved over the last several years in broadening its business beyond
municipal securities enabled nuveen investments to participate in the recovery
of equity markets through both positive net flows and market appreciation.
assets under management at the end of 2003 totaled
$95.4 billion, 20% higher than the year-end 2002 total of $79.7 billion. the
increase was driven by the strong net flows during the year, as well as $6.2
billion of equity and bond market appreciation. managed assets at the end of
the year were comprised of $47.1 billion of exchange-traded funds, $25.7
billion of retail managed accounts, $10.3 billion of institutional managed
accounts, and $12.3 billion of mutual funds.
investment advisory
revenue totaled $405 million in 2003, 14% higher than 2002 revenue of $355
million. the increase in assets under management as well as the nwq acquisition
in august2002 accounted for a portion of the higher revenues in 2003. performance
fee revenues of $34 million grew 48% over comparable 2002 fees of $23 million,
due to continued strong fixed income performance at symphony. the 15% increase
in operating expenses in 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily due to the
inclusion of nwq in nuveen investments results for an entire year.
2002 vs. 2001gross
sales of investment products of $15.6 billion in 2002 grew 10% over sales of
$14.2 billion in 2001. the increase over 2001 was driven by an increase in
exchange-traded fund sales. municipal mutual fund sales and institutional
managed account sales also increased over 2001. sales of retail managed
accounts declined, as the addition of nwq value accounts was more than offset
by a reduction in equity growth account sales. defined portfolio sales also
declined in 2002, due to nuveen investments decision to exit this product line
in 2002. net flows of $7.3 billion in 2002 were down 5% from comparable 2001
net flows of $7.7 billion. net flows were positive across all product
categories in 2002managed
accounts, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds. nuveen investments introduced
18 municipal closed-end exchange-traded funds in 2002, which, combined with
municipal mutual funds and managed accounts, raised $4.8 billion in net new
assets for the year. in addition, nuveen investments launched the first
preferred stock closed-end exchange-traded fund in the industry, generating
approximately $4 billion in new assets.
assets under management at
the end of 2002 of $79.7 billion, were 16% higher than the year-end 2001 total
of $68.5 billion. the nwq acquisition accounted for approximately $7 billion of
the increase, with the remainder due to strong net flows that more than offset
equity market declines. managed assets at the end of the year were comprised of
$39.9 billion of exchange-traded funds, $19.4 billion of retail managed
accounts, $8.5 billion of institutional managed accounts, and $11.9 billion of
mutual funds.
investment advisory
revenue of $355 million in 2002 grew 8% over 2001 revenues of $331 million. a
full year of symphony and the addition of nwq accounted for approximately 6% of
the increase, while exchange-traded funds and other fixed-income products drove
the remainder. revenues on exchange-traded funds grew 10% due to an increase in
average assets under management as a result of both positive net flows and
market appreciation. this increase was partially offset by a decline in
advisory revenue related to equity growth accounts, where assets under
management declined due to market depreciation and withdrawals.
share repurchasesnuveen investments repurchased common
shares from minority shareholders in 2003, 2002 and 2001 for total costs of $42
million, $151 million and $172 million, respectively. no shares were
repurchased from the st. paul in those years. our percentage ownership in nuveen
investments grew from 78% at the end of
2000 to 79% at the end of 2003, as the share repurchases were
substantially offset by nuveen investments issuance of additional shares under
various stock option and incentive plans and the issuance of common shares upon
the conversion of a portion of its preferred stock. as part of a new share
repurchase program approved in august2002, nuveen investments had
authority from its board of directors to purchase up to 7.0 million shares of
its common stock. at december31, 2003, there were 4.2 million shares
remaining under the new share repurchase program.

deconsolidated the five business trusts that issued mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities to investors. see further information in the following
discussion. in accordance with accounting rules, prior years were not restated
to conform to the 2003 presentation.
common equityin 2003, the 8% increase in common
shareholders equity was driven by our net income of $661 million for the year.
in 2002, our issuance of new common shares through a public offering and our
net income of $218 million were the primary factors contributing to the 12%
increase in common equity over year-end 2001. the following summarizes the
major factors impacting our common shareholders equity in each of the last
three years.
common dividends. we declared common dividends
totaling $264 million in 2003, $252 million in 2002 and $235 million in 2001. in
february2004, the st. pauls board of directors declared a quarterly
dividend of $0.29 per share payable april16, 2004, level with the 2003
quarterly rate.
common share issuance. in july2002,
we issued 17.8 million common shares at $24.20 per share in a public offering
that generated net proceeds of $413 million. the majority of proceeds were
contributed as capital to our insurance underwriting subsidiaries.
common share repurchases. in 2003 and 2002, we made no
significant repurchases of our common shares. in 2001, we repurchased and
retired 13.0 million of our common shares for a total cost of $589 million, or
approximately $45 per share. the share repurchases in 2001 occurred prior to september11
and represented 6% of our total shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
the share repurchases in 2001 were financed through a combination of internally
generated funds and new debt issuances.
unrealized appreciation of investments. the
net after-tax appreciation on our fixed income investment portfolio declined by
$114 million from year-end 2002, reflecting a decline in the market value of
that portfolio due to an increase in market interest rates in 2003. in 2002,
the net after-tax appreciation on our fixed income portfolio grew by $300
million over year-end 2001, reflecting the significant decline in interest
rates during the year.
preferred equitypreferred shareholders equity
consisted of the par value of the seriesb preferred shares we issued to
our stock ownership plan (sop) trust, less the remaining principal balance of
the sop trust debt. during 2003, 2002 and 2001, the trust made principal
payments of $18 million, $13 million and $14 million, respectively, on the
trust debt.
debtour consolidated debt outstanding at
the end of the last three years consisted of the following components.

2003 vs. 2002 as discussed in more detail in note
12 to the consolidated financial statements, in the fourth quarter of 2003 we
concluded that the provisions of fasb interpretation no.46 consolidation
of variable interest entities(as revised) (fin 46(r)) applied to the five
business trusts that issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to
investors which were fully guaranteed by us. as a result, we de-consolidated
these trusts, and now report our borrowings from these trusts as debt on our
consolidated balance sheet. in years prior to 2003, the preferred securities
issued by these trusts and guaranteed by us were reported in our balance sheet
as a separate line item between total liabilities and shareholders equity, and
referred to as company-obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of trusts
holding solely subordinated debentures of the company. prior to 2003, the debt issued by us to the
trusts was eliminated in consolidation. the following is a summary of the
provisions of the five business trusts, each of which was formed for the sole
purpose of issuing those securities.
st.
paul capital trust i issued 23,000,000 preferred securities generating gross
proceeds of $575 million, the proceeds of which were used to purchase
subordinated debentures issued by us. we make quarterly interest payments at a
rate of 7.6% on the debentures, which have a mandatory redemption date of october15,
2050. the preferred securities issued by the trust in turn pay a quarterly
distribution at an annual rate of 7.6%. we can redeem the debentures on or
after november13, 2006. the proceeds of such redemption would be used by
the trust to redeem a like amount of its preferred securities.
mmi
capital trust i issued $125 million of preferred securities in 1997, the
proceeds of which were used to purchase subordinated debentures issued by mmi
corporation. we assumed the liability for these debentures upon our acquisition
of mmi in 2000. we make semi-annual interest payments at a rate of 7.625% on
the debentures, which have a mandatory redemption date of december15,
2027. the preferred securities in turn pay a preferred distribution of 7.625%
semi-annually in arrears. in 2002, we repurchased and retired $4 million of the
mmi trust preferred securities in an open market transaction.
usf&g
capital trusts i,ii and iii each issued $100 million of preferred
securities in 1997 and 1996, the proceeds of which were used to purchase
subordinated debentures issued by usf&g corporation, which made semi-annual
interest payments at rates of 8.5%, 8.47% and 8.312%, respectively. we assumed
the liability for these debentures upon our merger with usf&g corporation
in 1998. since the merger, we have repurchased and retired securities from each
trust from time to time in open market transactions. the debentures related to
the usf&g capital trust i,ii and iii have mandatory redemption dates
of december15, 2045, january10, 2027 and july1, 2046,
respectively. debentures related to each trust may, however, be redeemed
earlier under certain conditions that vary among the three trusts. the proceeds
of such redemptions would be used to redeem a like amount of each trusts preferred
securities.
in the third quarter of 2003, nuveen investments
issued $300 million of 4.22% notes due in september2008 in a private
placement. a portion of the proceeds was
used to refinance existing debt and repay a $105 million loan from the st. paul.
the remainder will be used for nuveen investments general corporate purposes. during
2003, $67 million of the st. pauls medium-term notes matured, which were
funded through a combination of internally-generated funds and the issuance of
commercial paper.
vs. 2001the $541 million net increase in
reported debt obligations in 2002 over 2001 was primarily due to new debt
issuances to fund capital contributions and loans to our operating subsidiaries.
in march2002, we issued $500 million of 5.75% senior notes that mature in
2007, the proceeds of which were primarily used to repay a like amount of our
commercial paper outstanding at the time. in july2002, we sold 17.8
million of our common shares in a public offering for gross consideration of
$431 million, or $24.20 per share. in a separate concurrent public offering, we
sold 8.9 million equity units, each having a stated amount of $50, for gross
consideration of $443 million. each equity unit initially consists of a
three-year forward purchase contract for our common stock and our unsecured $50
senior note due in august2007. total annual distributions on the equity
units are at the rate of 9.00%, consisting of interest on the note at a rate of
5.25% and fee payments under the forward contract of 3.75%. the forward
contract requires the investor to purchase, for $50, a variable number of
shares of our common stock on the settlement date of august16, 2005. the
$46 million present value of the forward contract fee payments was recorded as
a reduction to our reported common shareholders equity. the number of shares
to be purchased will be determined based on a formula that considers the
average trading price of the stock immediately prior to the time of settlement
in relation to the $24.20 per share price at the time of the offering. had the
settlement date been december31, 2003 or 2002, we would have issued
approximately 15 million common shares based on the average trading price of
our common stock immediately prior to that date. the combined net proceeds of
these offerings, after underwriting commissions and other fees and expenses,
were approximately $842 million, of which $750 million was contributed as
capital to our insurance underwriting subsidiaries.
throughout 2002, medium-term notes totaling $49
million matured, and their repayment was funded through internally generated
funds. in july2002, nuveen investments entered into and fully drew down a
$250 million revolving line of credit with the st. paul. nuveen investments
used a portion of the proceeds to reduce the amount of debt outstanding on its
revolving bank line of credit from $183 million at the end of june2002 to
$55 million at december31, 2002.
interest expensenet interest expense on debt totaled
$187 million in 2003, compared with $112 million in 2002. the 2003 total
included $72 million of interest expense related to the debt associated with
the five business trusts described above. at the end of 2003 and 2002, we were
party to a number of interest rate swap agreements related to several of our
debt securities outstanding. the notional amount of these swaps totaled $730
million at both dates, and their aggregate fair value was $46 million and $65
million at year-end 2003 and 2002, respectively. the fair value of the swap
agreements is recorded as an asset, with a corresponding increase to reported
debt. these swap agreements had the effect of reducing our interest expense by
$32 million and $21 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securitiesas noted above, these securities were
issued by five business trusts that were fully guaranteed by the st. paul. prior
to the adoption of the provisions of fin 46(r) with respect to these trusts in
2003, the trusts were included in our consolidated financial statements and the
securities they issued were included in our balance sheet as a separate line
between liabilities and shareholders equity. in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, we did not restate prior year financial statements
upon our adoption of fin 46(r).
our total distribution expense related to the
preferred securities was $70 million in 2002 and $33 million in 2001. the
increase in 2002 was due to the $575 million, 7.6% securities issued by st.
paul capital trust i in november2001. in 2003, subsequent to the
de-consolidation of these trusts, the expense related to these trusts ($72
million) was included in our total interest expense.
major acquisitions and divestituresin march2002, we completed our
acquisition of london guarantee (now st.paul guarantee) for a total cost
of approximately $80 million, financed with internally generated funds.
in september2001, we sold our life insurance
subsidiary, f&g life, to old mutual plc, for $335 million in cash and 190.4
million old mutual ordinary shares (valued at $300 million at closing). the
cash proceeds received were used for general corporate purposes. in june2002,
we sold all of the old mutual shares we were holding for total net proceeds of
$287 million, which were also used for general corporate purposes.
capital commitmentswe made no major capital improvements
during any of the last three years, and none are anticipated in 2004.

liquidity
liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient
cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of our business
operations. our underwriting operations short-term cash needs primarily
consist of paying insurance loss and loss adjustment expenses and day-to-day
operating expenses. those needs are met through cash receipts from operations,
which consist primarily of insurance premiums collected and investment income.
our investment portfolio is also a source of additional liquidity, through the
sale of readily marketable fixed maturities, equity securities and short-term
investments, as well as longer-term investments such as real estate and venture
capital holdings. after satisfying our cash requirements, excess cash flows
from these underwriting and investment activities are used to build the
investment portfolio and thereby increase future investment income.
net cash flows provided by continuing operations
totaled $133 million in 2003, compared with cash provided by continuing
operations of $129 million in 2002 and $884 million in 2001. operational cash
flows in 2003 were negatively impacted by the january2003 payment of $747
million related to the western macarthur asbestos litigation settlement, which
accounted for a significant portion of the net $1.2 billion decline in insurance
reserves disclosed on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended
december31, 2003. the
additional decline in insurance reserves was primarily due to loss and loss
adjustment expense payments related to our other operations that were placed in
runoff at the end of 2001, which included our health care and reinsurance
operations, as well as several of our international underwriting operations. we
have ceased underwriting new business in these operations, and as expected, the
payments out of previously established reserves have exceeded new loss and loss
adjustment expense reserve provisions, resulting in a decline in our total
reserve balance. our cash flows from operations improved during the second half
of 2003, however, reflecting the impact of price increases and continuing
improvement in the quality of our book of business in our ongoing underwriting
segments.
our operational cash flows in 2002 were negatively
impacted by the $248 million payment made in junerelated to the western
macarthur asbestos litigation settlement, net payments of $289 million
associated with our transfer of unearned premium balances and other
reinsurance-related balances to platinum underwriters holdings, ltd. in
november, loss payments totaling $242 million related to the september11,
2001 terrorist attack and contributions to our pension plans totaling $158
million in december. loss and loss adjustment expense payments from our other
business segments in runoff, where our written premium volume was significantly
less than in 2001, also negatively impacted our consolidated operating cash
flows.
we believe our financial strength continues to provide
us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or
equity financings on both a short-term and long-term basis. we continue to
maintain an $800 million commercial paper program with $600 million of back-up
liquidity, consisting entirely of bank credit agreements. in january2003,
we established a program providing for the offering of up to $500 million of
medium-term notes. as of february27, 2004, we had not issued any notes
under this program. the consummation of the proposed merger would trigger a
technical event of default under certain of our credit agreements; however, the
lenders have agreed to waive the technical event of default, contingent upon
the consummation of the proposed merger.
we primarily depend on dividends from our subsidiaries
to pay dividends to our shareholders, service our debt, and pay expenses. st.
paul fire and marine insurance company (fire and marine) is our lead u.s.
property-liability underwriting subsidiary and its dividend paying capacity is
limited by the laws of minnesota, its state of domicile. fire and marines
ability to receive dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries is also
subject to restrictions of their respective states or other jurisdictions of
domicile. business and regulatory considerations may impact the amount of
dividends actually paid. approximately $774 million will be available to us
from payment of ordinary dividends by fire and marine in 2004. any dividend
payments beyond the $774 million limitation are subject to prior approval of
the minnesota commissioner of commerce. in 2003, we received dividends in the
form of cash and securities totaling $625 million from our u.s. underwriting
subsidiaries. we received no cash dividends from our u.s. property-liability
underwriting subsidiaries in 2002. in 2001, we received dividends in the form
of cash and securities of $827 million from fire and marine.
we are not aware of any
current recommendations by regulatory authorities that, if implemented, might
have a material impact on our liquidity, capital resources or operations.

independent ratings
ratings with respect to claims paying ability and
financial strength are important factors in establishing the competitive
position of insurance companies and will also impact the cost and availability
of capital to an insurance company. we compete with other insurance companies,
financial intermediaries and financial institutions on the basis of a number of
factors, including the ratings assigned by internationally-recognized rating
organizations. ratings represent an important consideration in maintaining
customer confidence in our ability to market insurance products. rating
organizations
regularly analyze the
financial performance and condition of insurers. any ratings downgrades, or the
potential for ratings downgrades, could adversely affect our ability to market
and distribute products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
in april2003, moodys investors services,inc.
lowered certain of our financial ratings and those of our insurance underwriting
subsidiaries and established a stable outlook on the ratings going forward. in june2003,a.m.
best co. also lowered certain of our financial ratings while affirming those of
our insurance underwriting subsidiaries and maintaining stable outlooks for both
sets of ratings going forward.
in connection with
the announcement of the proposed merger in november2003,a.m. best,
moodys investor service (moodys), standard& poors ratings services
(s&p) and fitch ratings (fitch) announced the following rating actions:
a.m.
best: placed our financial strength and debt ratings under review with positive
implications.
moodys:
confirmed the financial strength and debt ratings; raised the financial
strength rating outlook from stable to positive; confirmed the stable outlook
for debt ratings.
s&p:
placed the financial strength and debt ratings on creditwatch with positive
implications and indicated that the ratings could be affirmed or raised by one
notch.
fitch:
placed the debt ratings on rating watch positive and indicated that the long
term debt rating could be upgraded by one or two notches.
subsequent to these
initial announcements,a.m. best, s&p and fitch announced the
following:
a.m.
best: revised the implications of its review of our financial strength and debt
ratings from positive to developing, following our announcement of a
$350million pretax charge in the 2003 fourth quarter to increase reserves
for our health care business, which is in runoff.
s&p:
revised the creditwatch status of our financial strength and debt ratings from
positive to developing, following our announcement of the $350million
pretax charge, and subsequently revised the creditwatch status from developing
to negative, following its latest assessment of us on a stand-alone basis. it
indicated that, subject to the completion of the proposed merger, it expects to
affirm our current a+ financial strength rating and bbb+ senior unsecured debt
rating, which would align the ratings with those of travelers post-close of the
proposed merger. it also indicated that if the proposed merger were not
completed, it would expect to downgrade us to an a financial strength rating
and a bbb senior unsecured debt rating.
fitch:
revised the rating watch status of our debt ratings from positive to evolving,
following our announcement of the $350million pretax charge, and
subsequently lowered our senior unsecured debt rating from bbb+ to bbb,
following its latest assessment of us on a stand-alone basis. fitch simultaneously
revised the rating watch status from evolving to positive and indicated its
belief that it will likely upgrade our ratings upon the close of the proposed
merger with travelers.
ratings are not in any way a measure of protection
afforded to investors and should not be relied upon in making an investment
decision.

pension plans
due to the long-term nature of obligations under our
pension plans, the accounting for such plans is complex and reflects various
actuarial assumptions. managements selection of plan assumptions, primarily
the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation and the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (ltror), can have a
significant impact on our resulting estimated projected benefit obligation and
pension cost, and thus on our consolidated results of operations. such plan
assumptions are determined annually, subject to revision if significant events
occur during the year, such as plan mergers and significant plan amendments.
our pension plan measurement date for purposes of our
consolidated financial statements is december31. the market-related value
of plan assets is determined based on their fair value at the measurement date.
the projected benefit obligation is determined based on the present value of
projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate. the discount rate
used reflects the rate at which we believe the pension plan obligations could
be effectively settled at the measurement date, as though the pension benefits
of all plan participants were determined as of that date. at december31,
2003 and 2002, the discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit
obligation were 6.00% and 6.50%, respectively, for our consolidated pension
plans, which encompass our u.s. plan (including nuveen investments plan), our
canada plan and our u.k. plans. for our u.s. plan, which constituted 94% of our
consolidated pension plan assets at december31, 2003, such rates were
determined based on the moodys investor services aa long-term industrial decemberaverage
bond yield with a duration of approximately 11 to 13 years (which correlates to
the expected duration of our pension obligations), rounded up to the nearest
quarter percent.
total pension cost encompasses the cost of service,
interest costs based on an assumed discount rate, an expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains and losses, adjusted
for curtailment gains or losses, if any. actuarial gains and losses include the
impact of unrecognized gains and losses that are deferred and amortized over
the expected future service period of active employees. any unrecognized gains
or losses related to changes in the amount of the projected benefit obligation
or plan assets resulting from experience that differs from the expected returns
and from changes in assumptions are deferred. to the extent an unrecognized
gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit
obligation or the fair value of plan assets (10 percent corridor), the excess
is recognized over the expected future service periods of active employees. at december31,
2003, the accumulated unrecognized loss for our consolidated pension plans
subject to minimum amortization approximated $305 million, which exceeded the
10 percent corridor, and will be amortized over 12 years. as a result, pension
cost in 2004 is expected to include approximately $25 million of amortization. the
amount of the unrecognized gain or loss that is less than the 10% corridor, and
is therefore not subject to minimum amortization in 2004, was approximately
$117 million at december31, 2003.
the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on the plans
actual historical return results, the expected allocation of plan assets by
investment class, market conditions and other relevant factors. we evaluate
only whether the actual allocation has fallen within an expected range, and we
then evaluate actual asset returns in total, rather than by asset class, giving
consideration to the fact that our equity investments have a higher volatility
than our other investment classes, which is consistent with the market in
general. the following table presents the actual allocation of plan assets in
comparison with the expected allocation range, both expressed as a percentage
of total plan assets, on a consolidated basis as of december31, 2003 and
for our u.s. plan only as of december31, 2002. our u.s. plan accounted
for 95% of our consolidated pension plan assets as of december31, 2002.

at december31, 2000, our discount rate
assumption was determined based on a weighted average of the rates expected to
be used to settle our obligations, considering the portion of our obligation
expected to be settled by annuity payments and the portion expected to be
settled by lump sum payments. at december31, 2001, considering the impact
of the plan design change to add a cash balance formula, we determined that the
vast majority of the participants electing to remain under the traditional
pension formula would select the annuity payment option. as such, we determined
our projected benefit obligation was more appropriately calculated using
strictly the rate at which we believed we could settle the annuity obligations.
based on our assumption that the vast majority of the participants electing to
remain under the traditional pension formula would select the annuity payment
option, we eliminated from our discount rate determination the lower rate that
we assume would otherwise be used to settle lump sum payments, and thereby
increased our discount rate as of december31, 2001. in 2002, the
declining interest rate environment caused us to reduce our discount rate and
ltror as of december31, 2002. in 2003, the declining interest rate
environment caused us to reduce our discount rate as of december31, 2003.
the ltror remained the same.
as discussed above, investment and funding decisions
and pension plan assumptions can materially impact our consolidated financial
results of operations. consequently, our benefit plans investment committee regularly evaluates
investment returns, asset allocation strategies, possible plan contributions,
and plan assumptions. regardless of the extent of our analysis of such factors,
plan assumptions reflect judgments and are subject to changes in economic
factors. there can be no assurance that our assumptions will prove to be
correct or that they will not be subject to significant adjustments over time. for
purposes
of comparison, for the
six-year period and 20-year period ended december31, 2003 and 2002, our
arithmetic average actual returns on our u.s. plan assets were 6.70% and
12.56%, respectively, for 2003 and 7.71% and 12.48%, respectively, for 2002. funding
decisions are made based on a number of factors, including the minimum
regulatory funding requirements, the maximum tax-deductible contributions, the
estimated market value of plan assets in relation to our accumulated benefit
obligation, current market conditions and other business factors. during 2002,
we made contributions to the u.s. plan and the united kingdom plans of
approximately $149 million and $9 million, respectively, that were primarily
necessitated by the significant decline in market value of equity investments
held by the plans, which was consistent with general market trends during 2002.
during 2003, we made contributions to the u.s. plan and the foreign plans of
approximately $30 million and $6 million, respectively.
the

accounting pronouncements to be adopted in the future
in december2002, the fasb issued sfas no.148,
accounting for stock-based compensationtransition and disclosure, which
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. this
statement requires additional disclosures in the event of a voluntary change. it
also no longer permits the use of the original prospective method of transition
for changes to the fair value based method for fiscal years beginning after december15,
2003. we currently account for stock-based compensation under apb opinion no.25,
accounting for stock issued to employees, using the intrinsic value method,
and have not made a determination regarding any change to the fair value
method.
as discussed in more detail in note 12 to the
consolidated financial statements, in december2003, the fasb issued a
revised version of fasb interpretation no.46, consolidation of variable interest entities (fin 46(r)),
which again deferred the effective date for certain provisions of fin 46(r)
until the first interim or annual period beginning after december15,
2003, which for us would be the period ended march31, 2004. under the
partial adoption provisions of fin 46(r), we early-adopted the consolidation
and disclosure provisions of this interpretation in 2003. our partial adoption
specifically excluded the following item.
lloyds syndicateswe participate in
various lloyds syndicates at varying levels. we continue to evaluate the
implications of fin 46(r) with respect to these syndicates, and at this time we
are not able to quantify the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial
statements.
on january12, 2004,
the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued fasb staff position
no.fas106-1, accounting and disclosure
requirements related to the medicare prescription drug, improvement and
modernization act of 2003 (fsp 106-1). this pronouncement
provides companies with the option to make a one-time election to defer
accounting for the effects of the medicare act referenced in its title (the
act). we have decided to defer accounting for the act under fsp106-1 and
have made the required disclosures in note13retirement plans to the
consolidated financial statements. the final accounting guidance could require
changes to previously reported information. we will monitor the fasb
deliberations and account for the act based on the pronouncement expected to be
issued.
definitions of
certain statutory accounting terms
statutory
expense ratio (a
statutory financial measure): the company uses the statutory definition
of expenses in calculating expense ratios disclosed. expenses are divided by
net written premiums to arrive at the expense ratio. statutory expenses
differ from gaap expenses primarily with regard to policy acquisition costs,
which are not deferred and amortized for statutory purposes, but rather
recognized as
incurred. in addition, the
gaap expense ratio uses net earned premiums rather than net written premiums as
the denominator.
statutory
loss ratio (a statutory financial measure): the
company uses the statutory definition of loss ratio. this ratio is calculated
by dividing losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net earned
premiums. net earned premiums and losses and loss adjustment expenses, are both
gaap and statutory measures.
statutory
combined ratio (a statutory financial measure): the
sum of the statutory expense ratio and the statutory loss ratio.
net
written premiums(a statutory financial measure) and net earned premiums (a gaap financial measure): net
written premiums are a statutory measure of premium volume that differs from
the net earned premiums reported in our gaap statement of operations. written
premiums for a period can be reconciled to earned premiums by adding or
subtracting the change in unearned premium reserves in the period.
underwriting results by segment (a gaap financial
measure): our reported underwriting results are our best measure of
profitability for our property-liability underwriting segments and accordingly
are disclosed in the footnotes to our financial statements required by sfas
no.131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
underwriting results are calculated by subtracting incurred losses and loss
adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses (as adjusted for items such as
the impact of deferred policy acquisition costs) from net earned premiums. we
do not allocate net investment income to our respective underwriting segments.

exposures to market
risk
market risk can be described as the risk of change in
fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in interest rates, equity
prices, creditworthiness, foreign exchange rates or other factors. we seek to
mitigate that risk by a number of actions, as described below. our policies to
address these risks in 2003 were unchanged from 2002. in 2002, the only
significant changes to our market risk from 2001 were a reduced allocation of
assets to our equity investment portfolio, and a reduction in the estimated
duration of our fixed income investment portfolio, which includes our
consolidated holdings of fixed income securities, securities on loan and
short-term investments.
as discussed in more detail in the critical accounting policies section of
this discussion, there are risks and uncertainties related to our assessment of
other than temporary impairments in our investment portfolio.
interest rate riskour exposure to market risk for
changes in interest rates is concentrated in our investment portfolio, and to a
lesser extent, our debt obligations. however, changes in investment values
attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and
partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our insurance reserves
and debt obligations. we monitor this exposure through periodic reviews of our
asset and liability positions. our estimates of cash flows, as well as the
impact of interest rate fluctuations relating to our investment portfolio and
insurance reserves, are modeled and reviewed quarterly. at december31,
2003, the estimated duration of our fixed income investment portfolio
(consolidated holdings of fixed income securities, securities on loan and short
term investments) was 3.8 years, compared with 3.3 years at december31,
2002. it should be noted that during the quarter ending september30, 2003
new modeling capabilities for estimating the effective duration of municipal
bonds were introduced to replace previous estimates based on the market
yield-to-worst. the effect of
this change was to
increase the estimate of overall duration by approximately 0.3 years over and
above what would have resulted from the application of previous estimation
procedures.
the
following table provides principal cash flow estimates by year for our december31,
2003 and 2002 holdings of interest-sensitive investment assets considered to be
other than trading. those holdings consist of our consolidated fixed income
securities, securities on loan, short-term investments, mortgage loans and
certain securities issued as part of a series of insurance transactions. also
provided are the weighted-average interest rates associated with each years
cash flows. principal cash flow projections for collateralized mortgage
obligations and asset-backed securities were prepared using third-party
prepayment models and estimates. cash flow estimates for mortgage pass-throughs
were prepared using consensus prepayment forecasts obtainable from a
third-party provider. principal cash flow estimates for callable bonds are
either to maturity or to the next call date depending on whether the call was
projected to be in-the-money assuming no change in interest rates. no
projection of the impact of reinvesting the estimated cash flows is included in
the table, regardless of whether the cash flow source is a short-term or
long-term fixed maturity security. our fixed income investments are primarily
held to pay liabilities inherent in our insurance reserves. the composition of
our portfolios estimated principal and interest runoff helps ensure that
adequate financial resources will be available to fund each years estimated
insurance liability payments, as such payments become due.

to mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk
related to certain of our fixed rate medium-term and senior notes, we have
entered into a number of pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap
agreements that, in the aggregate, have a notional amount of $730 million. of
the total notional amount of the swaps, $330 million mature in 2005, $150
million mature in 2008 and $250 million mature in 2010, with a weighted average
pay rate of 3.19% and a weighted average receive rate of 7.57%. these swaps had
a fair value of $46 million and $65 million at december31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.
in 2003, we included debt owed to five business trusts
that have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to investors, the
obligations of which have been fully guaranteed by us. as discussed in further
detail in the adoption of accounting standards section of this report, in
2003 we adopted the provisions of fin46(r), which resulted in the
deconsolidation of these trusts from our consolidated financial statements. as
a result, the debt we issued to these trusts (previously eliminated in
consolidation) is now shown in our consolidated debt outstanding, whereas the
preferred securities, which were previously included in our consolidated balance
sheet between liabilities and shareholders equity, are no longer included in
our balance sheet. the weighted average interest rate on the debt owed to the
five trusts was 7.8 % at december31, 2003 and 2002. the fair value of
these securities was $1.03 billion and $959 million as of december31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. approximately $575 million of the securities are
callable at the companys option after november13, 2006. an additional
$78 million are callable at the companys option between 2007 and their
maturity in 2027.
credit riskour portfolios of fixed income securities,
mortgage loans and to a lesser extent short-term and other investments are
subject to credit risk. this risk is defined as the potential loss in market
value resulting from adverse changes in the borrowers ability to repay the
debt. our objective is to earn competitive relative returns by investing in a
diversified portfolio of securities. we manage this risk by up-front, stringent
underwriting analysis, reviews by a credit committee and regular meetings to
review credit developments. watchlists are maintained for exposures requiring
additional review, and all credit exposures are reviewed at least annually. at december31,
2003, approximately 98% of our fixed income portfolio was rated investment
grade.
in certain of our operations, we underwrite certain
business for sophisticated insurance purchasers, and reinsure a substantial
portion of that risk with traditional reinsurers or captive insurance entities.
although these transactions are highly collateralized, there is a degree of
credit risk associated with these transactions. we perform credit reviews of
the underlying financial stability of the insured and/or assuming reinsurance
entity as part of our program to manage this risk.
we also have other receivable amounts subject to
credit risk. the most significant of these are reinsurance recoverables. to
mitigate the risk of these counterparties nonpayment of amounts due, we
establish business and financial standards for reinsurer approval,
incorporating ratings by major rating agencies and considering current market
information.
foreign currency exposureour exposure to market risk
for changes in foreign exchange rates is concentrated in our invested assets,
and insurance reserves, denominated in foreign currencies. cash flows from our
foreign operations are the primary source of funds for our purchase of
investments denominated in foreign currencies. we purchase these investments
primarily to hedge insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the
same currency, effectively reducing our foreign currency exchange rate exposure.
for those foreign insurance operations that were identified at the end of 2001
as businesses to be exited, we intend to continue to closely match the foreign
currency-denominated liabilities with assets in the same currency. at december31,
2003 and 2002, approximately 13% of our invested assets were denominated in
foreign currencies. invested assets denominated in the british pound sterling
comprised approximately 7% of our total invested assets at december31,
2003. we have determined that a hypothetical 10% reduction in the value of the
pound sterling would have an approximate $165 million reduction in the value of
our assets, although there would be a similar offsetting
change in the value of the
related insurance reserves. no other individual foreign currency accounts for
more than 4% of our invested assets.
we have also entered into foreign currency forwards with
a u.s. dollar equivalent notional amount of $203.5 million as of december31,
2003 to hedge our foreign currency exposure on certain contracts. of this
total, 78% are denominated in british pound sterling, 12% are denominated in
the australian dollar, and 10% are denominated in the canadian dollar.
equity price riskour portfolio of marketable equity
securities, which we carry on our balance sheet at market value, has exposure
to price risk. this risk is defined as the potential loss in market value resulting
from an adverse change in prices. our objective is to earn competitive relative
returns by investing in a diverse portfolio of high-quality, liquid securities.
portfolio characteristics are analyzed regularly and market risk is actively
managed through a variety of modeling techniques. our holdings are diversified
across industries, and concentrations in any one company or industry are
limited by parameters established by senior management, as well as by statutory
requirements.
included in our other investments at december31,
2003 and 2002 was our 14% equity ownership in platinum underwriters holdings,
ltd. (platinum), received as partial consideration from the transfer of our
ongoing reinsurance business to platinum. we account for our investment in
platinum using the equity method of accounting. therefore, changes in platinums
stock price do not impact our balance sheet or statement of operations, unless
our investment in platinum was deemed to be impaired. also included in our
other investments are stock purchase warrants for platinum. the warrants had a
value of $65 million and $61 million as
of december31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. the warrants are considered
derivatives and are marked to market quarterly, with changes in fair value
being recognized as realized gains or losses in our statement of operations. the
warrants are valued using the roll-geske-whaley valuation model and as such are
impacted by the market price of platinum stock.
our portfolio of venture capital investments also has
exposure to market risks, primarily relating to the viability of the various
entities in which we have invested. these investments, primarily in early-stage
companies, involve more risk than other investments, and we actively manage our
market risk in a variety of ways. first, we allocate a comparatively small
amount of funds to venture capital. at the end of 2003, the cost of these
investments accounted for only 2% of total invested assets. second, the
investments are diversified to avoid excessive concentration of risk in a
particular industry. third, we perform extensive research prior to investing in
a new venture to gauge prospects for success. fourth, we regularly monitor the
operational results of the entities in which we have invested. finally, we generally
sell our holdings in these firms soon after they become publicly traded when we
are legally able to do so, thereby reducing exposure to further market risk.
at december31, 2003, our marketable equity
securities were recorded at their fair value of $171million. a
hypothetical 10% decline in each stocks price would have resulted in a $17million
impact on fair value.
at december31, 2003, our venture capital
investments were recorded at their fair value of $535 million. a hypothetical
10% decline in each investments fair value would have resulted in a $54
million impact on fair value.
catastrophe riskwe manage and monitor our aggregate
property catastrophe exposure through various methods, including purchasing
catastrophe reinsurance, establishing underwriting restrictions and applying a
dedicated catastrophe pricing model. see
item 1 of this report for further information about our management of
catastrophe risk.
item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
managements
responsibility for consolidated financial statements
scope
of responsibilitymanagement prepares the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and related information and is
responsible for their integrity and objectivity. the statements were prepared
in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles. these
consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on managements
estimates and judgments, particularly our reserves for losses and loss
adjustment expenses. we believe that these statements present fairly the
companys financial position and results of operations and that the other
information contained in this annual report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements.
internal
controlswe maintain and rely on systems of
internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that
assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly authorized and recorded. we
continually monitor these internal accounting controls, modifying and improving
them as business conditions and operations change. our internal audit
department also independently reviews and evaluates these controls. we
recognize the inherent limitations in all internal control systems and believe
that our systems provide an appropriate balance between the costs and benefits
desired. we believe our systems of internal accounting controls provide
reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that would be material to
the consolidated financial statements are prevented or detected in the normal course
of business.
independent
auditorsour independent auditors, kpmg
llp, have audited the consolidated financial statements. their audit was
conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
united states of america, which includes the consideration of our internal
controls to the extent necessary to form an independent opinion on the
consolidated financial statements prepared by management.
audit
committeethe audit committee of the board
of directors, composed solely of independent directors, assists the board of
directors in overseeing managements discharge of its financial reporting
responsibilities. the committee meets with management, our director of internal
audit and representatives of kpmg llp to discuss significant changes to
financial reporting principles and policies and internal controls and
procedures proposed or contemplated by management, our internal auditors or
kpmg llp. additionally, the committee undertakes on behalf of the board of
directors the selection, evaluation and, if applicable, replacement of our
independent auditors; and in the evaluation of the independence of the
independent auditors. both internal audit and kpmg llp have access to the audit
committee without managements presence.
code
of conductwe recognize our responsibility
for maintaining a strong ethical climate. this responsibility is addressed in
the companys written code of conduct.

the st. paul
companies, inc.:
we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of the st. paul companies,inc. and subsidiaries as of december31,
2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended december31, 2003. these consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the united states of america. those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the st. paul companies,inc. and subsidiaries as of december31,
2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended december31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states
of america.
as
discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the
company adopted the provisions of the statement of financial accounting
standards no.133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities and, as also described in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements, in 2002 the company adopted the provisions of the statement of
financial accounting standards no.141, business combinations and the
statement of financial accounting standards no.142, goodwill and other
intangible assets and, as also described in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements, in 2003 the company adopted the provisions of financial
accounting standards board interpretation no.46, consolidation of
variable interest entities.

the st. paul companies
1 summary
of significant accounting policies
accounting
principleswe
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with united states
generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). we follow the accounting
standards established by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and
the american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa).
consolidationwe combine our financial statements with
those of our subsidiaries and present them on a consolidated basis. the
consolidated financial statements do not include the results of material
transactions between our subsidiaries and us or among our subsidiaries. certain
of our foreign underwriting operations results, and the results of certain of
our investments in partnerships, are recorded on a one-month to one-quarter lag
due to time constraints in obtaining and analyzing such results for inclusion
in our consolidated financial statements on a current basis. in the event that
significant events occur during the lag period, the impact is included in the
current period results.
in the first quarter of 2003, we eliminated the
one-quarter reporting lag for our operations at lloyds. the effect of
reporting those operations on a current basis was a $34 million reduction to
our 2003 pretax income from continuing operations. during 2001, we eliminated
the one-quarter reporting lag for certain of our primary underwriting
operations in foreign countries. the effect of reporting those operations on a
current basis was a $31 million increase to our 2001 pretax loss from
continuing operations.
related
party transactionsthe
following summarizes our related party transactions:
indebtedness of managementwe have made loans to certain current and
former executive officers for their purchase of our common stock in the open
market. these are full-recourse loans, further secured by a pledge of the stock
purchased with the proceeds. the loans accrue interest at the applicable
federal rate for loans of such maturity. loans to former executive officers are
being repaid in accordance with agreed-upon terms. the total amount receivable
under this program, included in other assets, was $1 million and $7 million
on december31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. this program was terminated
effective march20, 2002; consequently, no new loans were made after that
date.
indebtedness of venture capital managementwe
have made loans to certain members of management of our venture capital
investment operation. the loans are secured by each individuals ownership
interest in the limited liability companies that hold most of our venture
capital investments, and accrue interest at the applicable federal rate for
loans of such maturity. the total amount receivable under this program,
included in other assets at december31, 2003 and 2002, was $7 million.
platinum underwriters holdings, ltd. (platinum)see
note 19 in this report for a summary of related-party transactions with
platinum.
discontinued
operationssee
note 17 in this report for a summary of our discontinued operations.
reclassificationswe reclassified certain amounts in our
2002 and 2001 consolidated financial statements and notes to conform to the
2003 presentation. these reclassifications had no effect on net income, or
common or preferred shareholders equity, as previously reported for those
years.
use of estimateswe make estimates and assumptions that
have an effect on the amounts that we report in our consolidated financial
statements. our most significant estimates are those relating to our
reserves for
property-liability losses and loss adjustment expenses. we continually review
our estimates and make adjustments as necessary, but actual results could turn
out to be significantly different from what we expected when we made these
estimates.
accounting for our
property-liability underwriting operations
premiums
earnedpremiums
on insurance policies are our largest source of revenue. for all of our
non-lloyds business, we recognize premiums as revenues evenly over the policy
terms using the daily pro rata method. in 2003, we changed the method by which
we recognize premium revenue at our operations at lloyds. prior to 2003, such
revenue was recognized using the one-eighths method, whereby we converted
lloyds syndicate accounts to u.s. gaap on a quarterly basis. since lloyds
accounting does not recognize the concept of earned premium, we calculated
earned premium as part of the conversion to gaap, assuming business was written
at the middle of each quarter, effectively breaking the calendar year into
earnings periods of eighths. in 2003, we began recognizing lloyds premium
revenue in a manner that more accurately reflects the underlying policy terms
and exposures and is more consistent with the method by which we recognize
premium revenue in our non-lloyds business. this change did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december31,
2003.
revenues in our health care operation include premiums
generated from extended reporting endorsements. our medical liability
claims-made policies gave our insureds the right to purchase a reporting
endorsement, which is also referred to as tail coverage, at the time their
policies expired. this endorsement protected an insured against any claims that
arise from a medical incident that occurred while the claims-made policy was in
force, but which had not yet been reported by the time the policy expired. premiums
on these endorsements are fully earned as revenue, and the expected losses are
reserved, at the time the endorsement is written.
we record premiums that we have not yet recognized as
revenues as unearned premiums on our balance sheet. assumed reinsurance
premiums are recognized as revenues proportionately over the contract period.
premiums earned are recorded in our statement of operations, net of our cost to
purchase reinsurance.
insurance
losses and loss adjustment expenseslosses represent the amounts we paid or
expect to pay to claimants for events that have occurred. the costs of
investigating, resolving and processing these claims are known as loss
adjustment expenses (lae). we record these items on our statement of
operations net of reinsurance, meaning that we reduce our gross losses and loss
adjustment expenses incurred by the amounts we have recovered or expect to
recover under reinsurance contracts.
reinsurancewritten
premiums, earned premiums and incurred insurance losses and lae all reflect the
net effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions. assumed reinsurance
refers to our acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance
companies have underwritten. assumed reinsurance has, for the most part, been
written through our st. paul re operation. during 2002, we transferred our
ongoing business previously written through st. paul re to platinum
underwriters holdings, ltd. see note19 for a more detailed discussion of
this transfer. ceded reinsurance means other insurance companies have agreed to
share certain risks with us. reinsurance accounting is followed for assumed and
ceded transactions when risk transfer requirements have been met. these
requirements involve significant assumptions being made related to the amount
and timing of expected cash flows, as well as the interpretation of underlying
contract terms.
insurance
reserves we
establish reserves for the estimated total unpaid cost of losses and lae, which
cover events that occurred in 2003 and prior years. these reserves reflect our
estimates of the total cost of claims that were reported to us (case
reserves), but not yet paid, and the cost of claims incurred but not yet
reported to us (ibnr). we reduce our loss reserves for estimated amounts of
salvage and
subrogation recoveries.
estimated amounts recoverable from reinsurers on paid and unpaid losses and
lae, net of an allowance for estimated unrecoverable amounts, are reflected as
assets.
for reported losses, we establish reserves on a case
basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy or
reinsurance agreement. for ibnr losses, we estimate reserves using established
actuarial methods. our case and ibnr reserve estimates consider such variables
as past loss experience, changes in legislative conditions, changes in judicial
interpretation of legal liability and policy coverages, and inflation. we
consider not only monetary increases in the cost of what we insure, but also
changes in societal factors that influence jury verdicts and case law and, in
turn, claim costs.
because many of the coverages we offer involve claims
that may not ultimately be settled for many years after they are incurred,
subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and
necessary component of our loss reserving process. we record our reserves by
considering a range of estimates bounded by a high and low point. within that
range, we record managements best estimate. we continually review our
reserves, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze
current claim costs, frequency and severity data, and prevailing economic,
social and legal factors. we adjust reserves established in prior years as loss
experience develops and new information becomes available. adjustments to
previously estimated reserves are reflected in our financial results in the
periods in which the changes in estimate are made.
reserves for environmental and asbestos exposures
cannot be estimated solely with the traditional loss reserving techniques
described above, which rely on historical accident year development factors and
take into consideration the previously mentioned variables. environmental and
asbestos reserves are more difficult to estimate than our other loss reserves
because of legal issues, societal factors and difficulty in determining the
parties who may ultimately be held liable. therefore, in addition to taking
into consideration the traditional variables that are utilized to arrive at our
other loss reserve amounts, we also look at the length of time necessary to
clean up polluted sites, controversies surrounding the identity of the
responsible party, the degree of remediation deemed to be necessary, the
estimated time period for litigation expenses, judicial expansions of coverage,
medical complications arising with asbestos claimants advanced age, case law,
and the history of prior claim development. we also consider the impact of
changes in the legal environment, including our experience in the western
macarthur matter, in establishing our reserves for other asbestos and
environmental cases. generally, case reserves and loss adjustment expense
reserves are established where sufficient information has been obtained to
indicate coverage under a specific insurance policy. we also consider end of
period reserves in relation to paid losses in a period. furthermore, ibnr
reserves are established to cover additional estimated exposures related to
policyholders that havent as yet asserted any claims as well as development on
reserves assumed from other entities. these reserves are continually reviewed
and updated as additional information is acquired.
while our reported reserves make
a reasonable provision for our unpaid loss and lae obligations, it should be
noted that the process of estimating required reserves, by its very nature,
involves substantial uncertainty. the level of uncertainty can be influenced by
factors such as the existence of coverage with long duration payment patterns
and changes in claim handling practices, as well as the factors noted above. ultimate
actual payments for claims and lae could turn out to be significantly different
from our estimates.
our liabilities for unpaid losses and lae related to
tabular workers compensation and certain assumed reinsurance coverage are
discounted to the present value of estimated future payments. prior to
discounting, these liabilities totaled $875 million and $887 million at december31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. the total discounted liability reflected on our
balance sheet was $710 million and $718 million at december31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. the liability for workers compensation was discounted
using rates of up to 3.5%. the liability for certain assumed reinsurance
coverage was discounted using rates up
to 7.5%, based on our
return on invested assets or, in many cases, on yields contractually guaranteed
to us on funds held by the ceding company, as permitted by the state of
domicile. tabular workers compensation reserves are indemnity reserves that
are calculated using discounts determined with reference to actuarial tables
that incorporate interest and contingencies such as mortality, remarriage,
inflation or recovery from disability applied to a reasonably determinable
payment stream. reserves for medical costs associated with the work place
injury and reserves for loss adjustment expenses are not discounted.
lloydswe participate in lloyds as the owner of
a managing agency and the provider of capital to the syndicates managed by that
managing agency. lloyds syndicates determine their underwriting results on an
underwriting year basis with results being declared only after three years. in
converting from lloyds accounting to u.s. gaap the most significant
adjustments relate to the earning of premiums and the recognition of losses on
an accident year basis. where we do not provide 100% of the capital to a
syndicate we record our pro rata share of syndicate assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. (also see discussion under premiums earned above.)
policy
acquisition expensesthe
costs directly related to writing an insurance policy are referred to as policy
acquisition expenses and consist of commissions, state premium taxes and other
direct underwriting expenses. although these expenses are incurred when we
issue a policy, we defer and amortize them over the same period as the
corresponding premiums are recorded as revenues. on a regular basis, we perform
a recoverability analysis of the deferred policy acquisition costs in relation
to the expected recognition of revenues, including anticipated investment
income, and reflect adjustments, if any, as period costs. should the analysis
indicate that the acquisition costs are unrecoverable, further analyses are
performed to determine if a reserve is required to provide for losses, which
may exceed the related unearned premiums.
allowance
for doubtful accountsour
allowance for doubtful accounts for premiums and deductibles receivable is
calculated by applying an estimated bad debt percentage to an aging of
receivables segmented by business unit to determine general collectibility. specific
collection issues are highlighted separately, and a comparison of prior year
write-offs with year-to-date results is made to determine reasonableness. we
also have an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables that is
calculated based on the outstanding balances, taking into consideration the
status of the reinsurer, the nature of the balance and whether or not the
amount is in dispute. the establishment of our allowance for doubtful accounts
involves judgment and therefore creates a degree of uncertainty as to adequacy
at each reporting date.
guarantee fund and other
insurance-related assessmentswe establish an accrual related to
estimated future guarantee fund payments and other insurance-related
assessments, primarily second injury funds. guarantee fund payments are based
on our historical experience as well as for specific known events or
insolvencies. loss-based second injury fund assessments are accrued based on
our total loss reserves for the relevant states and lines of business. as of december31,
2003 and 2002, we carried an accrual of $44 million and $43 million,
respectively, for these payments, which are expected to be disbursed as
assessed during a period of up to 30 years. we also establish assets related to
the recovery of these costs when appropriate. as of december31, 2003 and
2002, we carried assets of $17 million and $15 million for premium tax offsets,
respectively, and $4 million and $11 million for policy surcharges,
respectively. this accrual is subject to change following revisions to
assessments that may be enacted by any of the states where we write business.
accounting for our
asset management operations
we hold a 79% interest in nuveen investments,inc.
(nuveen investments, formerly the john nuveen company), which constitutes our
asset management segment. nuveen investments core businesses are asset
management and related research, as well as the development, marketing and
distribution of investment products and services for the affluent,
high-net-worth and institutional market
segments. nuveen
investments distributes its investment products and services, including
individually managed accounts, closed-end exchange-traded funds and mutual
funds, to the affluent and high-net-worth market segments through unaffiliated
intermediary firms including broker/dealers, commercial banks, affiliates of
insurance providers, financial planners, accountants, consultants and
investment advisors. nuveen investments also provides managed account services
to several institutional market segments and channels.
in august2002, nuveen investments purchased nwq
investment management company,inc. (nwq), an asset management firm
based in los angeles with approximately $6.9 billion of assets under management
at the time of acquisition in both retail and institutional managed accounts. nwq
specializes in value-oriented equity investments with significant relationships
among institutions and financial advisors serving high-net-worth investors.
in july2001, nuveen investments acquired
symphony asset management, llc (symphony), an institutional investment
manager, with approximately $4 billion in assets under management at the time
of acquisition. as a result of the acquisition, nuveen investments product
offerings were expanded to include managed accounts and funds designed to
reduce risk through market-neutral and other strategies in several equity and
fixed-income asset classes for institutional investors.
nuveen investments has three principal sources of
revenue: advisory fees on assets under management, including separately managed
accounts, closed-end exchange-traded funds and mutual funds; underwriting and
distribution revenues earned upon the sale of certain investment products; and
performance fees earned on certain institutional accounts based on the
performance of such accounts.
advisory revenue accounted for 90% of nuveen
investments consolidated revenues in 2003. total advisory fee income earned
during any period is directly related to the market value of the assets managed.
advisory fee income increases or decreases with a rise or fall, respectively,
in the level of assets under management. investment advisory fees are
recognized as services are provided. with respect to funds, nuveen investments
receives fees based either on each funds average daily net assets or on a
combination of the average daily net assets and gross interest income. with
respect to managed accounts, nuveen investments generally earns fees, on a
quarterly basis, based on the value of the assets managed on a particular date,
such as the last calendar day of a quarter, or on the average asset value for
the period.
nuveen investments distribution revenues are earned
as mutual fund productsare sold
to the public through financial advisors, and prior to the second quarter of
2002, the sale of defined portfolios. distribution revenues will rise and fall
commensurate with the level of sales of these products. in march2002,
nuveen investments ceased offering defined portfolio products. underwriting
fees are earned on the initial public offering of nuveen investments
exchange-traded funds.
through its subsidiary, symphony, which manages equity
and fixed-income market-neutral accounts and funds for institutional investors,
nuveen investments earns performance fees for investment performance above
specifically defined benchmarks. these fees are recognized as revenue only at
the performance measurement date contained in the individual account management
agreement. currently, approximately 80% of such measurement dates fall in the
second half of the calendar year.
we consolidate 100% of nuveen investments assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, with reductions on the balance sheet and
statement of operations for the minority shareholders proportionate interest
in nuveen investments equity and earnings. minority interest of $96 million
and $80 million was recorded in other liabilities at the end of 2003 and 2002,
respectively.
nuveen investments
repurchased and retired 1.7 million and 5.7 million of its common shares from
minority shareholders in 2003 and 2002, respectively, for a total cost of $42
million in 2003 and $151 million in 2002. no shares were repurchased from the
st. paul in those years. our percentage ownership remained at 79% in 2003 as
the effect of nuveen investments repurchases were partially offset by nuveen
investments
issuance of additional shares under various stock option and incentive plans
and, in 2002, the issuance of common shares upon the conversion of a portion of
its preferred stock.
accounting for our
investments
fixed
incomeour
fixed income portfolio is composed primarily of high-quality, intermediate-term
taxable u.s. government, corporate and mortgage-backed bonds, and tax-exempt
u.s. municipal bonds. our entire fixed income investment portfolio is
classified as available-for-sale. accordingly, we carry that portfolio on our
balance sheet at estimated fair value. fair values are based on quoted market
prices, where available, from a third-party pricing service. if quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are estimated using values obtained from
independent pricing services or a cash flow estimate is used.
real
estate and mortgage loansour real estate investments include warehouses and office
buildings and other commercial land and properties that we own directly or in
which we have a partial interest through joint ventures with other investors. our
mortgage loan investments consist of fixed-rate loans collateralized by
apartment, warehouse and office properties.
for direct real estate investments, we carry land at
cost and buildings at cost less accumulated depreciation and valuation
adjustments. we depreciate real estate assets on a straight-line basis over 40
years. tenant improvements are amortized over the term of the corresponding
lease. the accumulated depreciation of our real estate investments was $189
million and $169 million at december31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
we use the equity method of accounting for our real
estate joint ventures, which means we carry these investments at cost, adjusted
for our share of undistributed earnings or losses, and reduced by cash
distributions from the joint ventures and valuation adjustments. due to time
constraints in obtaining financial results, the results of these joint venture
operations are recorded on a one-month lag. if events occur during the lag
period that are significant to our consolidated results, the impact is included
in the current period results.
we carry our mortgage loans at the unpaid principal balances
less any valuation adjustments, which approximates fair value. valuation
allowances are recognized for loans with deterioration in collateral
performance that is deemed other than temporary. the estimated fair value of
mortgage loans was $63 million and $82 million at december31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.
venture
capitalour
venture capital investments represent ownership interests in small- to
medium-sized companies. these investments are made through limited partnerships
or direct ownership. the limited partnerships are carried at our equity in the
estimated market value of the investments held by these limited partnerships.
the investments we own directly are carried at estimated fair value. fair
values are based on quoted market prices obtained from third-party pricing
services for publicly traded stock, or an estimate of value as determined by an
internal valuation committee for privately-held securities. due to time
constraints in obtaining financial results, the operations of the limited partnerships
are recorded on a one-quarter lag. if security-specific events occur during the
lag period that are significant to our consolidated results, the impact is
included in the current period results.
equitiesour equity securities are also classified
as available-for-sale and carried at estimated fair value, which is based on
quoted market prices obtained from a third-party pricing service.
securities
on loanwe
participate in a securities lending program whereby certain securities from our
fixed income portfolio are loaned to other institutions. we require collateral
equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. we maintain
full ownership rights to the securities loaned, and continue to earn interest
on them. in addition, we have the ability to sell the securities while they are
on loan. we have an indemnification agreement with the lending agents in the
event a borrower becomes insolvent or fails to return securities. we record
securities lending collateral as a liability and pay the
borrower an agreed upon
interest rate. the proceeds from the collateral are invested in short-term
investments and are reported on the balance sheet. we share a portion of the
interest earned on these short-term investments with the lending agent. the fair
value of the securities on loan is removed from fixed income securities on the
balance sheet and shown as a separate investment asset.
realized
investment gains and losseswe record the cost of each individual investment so that
when we sell an investment, we are able to identify and record that transactions
gain or loss on our statement of operations.
the size of our investment portfolio allows our
portfolio managers a degree of flexibility in determining which individual
investments should be sold to achieve our primary investment goals of assuring
our ability to meet our commitments to policyholders and other creditors and
maximizing our investment returns. in order to meet the objective of
maintaining a flexible portfolio that can achieve these goals, our fixed income
and equity portfolios are classified as available-for-sale. we continually
evaluate these portfolios, and our purchases and sales of investments are based
on our cash requirements, the characteristics of our insurance liabilities, and
current market conditions. we also monitor the difference between our cost and
the estimated fair value of investments, which involves uncertainty as to
whether declines in value are temporary in nature. at the time we determine an other
than temporary impairment in the value of a particular investment to have
occurred, we consider the current facts and circumstances, including the
financial position and future prospects of the entity that issued the
investment security, and make a decision to either record a write-down in the
carrying value of the security or sell the security; in either case,
recognizing a realized loss.
with respect to our venture capital portfolio, we
manage our portfolio to maximize return, evaluating current market conditions
and the future outlook for the entities in which we have invested. because this
portfolio primarily consists of privately-held, early-stage venture
investments, events giving rise to impairment can occur in a brief period of
time (e.g., the entity has been unsuccessful in securing additional financing,
other investors decide to withdraw their support, complications arise in the
product development process, etc.), and decisions are made at that point in
time, based on the specific facts and circumstances, with respect to a
recognition of other than temporary impairment, or sale of the investment.
unrealized
appreciation or depreciation on investmentsfor investments we carry at estimated
fair value, we record the difference between cost and fair value, net of deferred
taxes, as a part of common shareholders equity. this difference is referred to
as unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. the change in
unrealized appreciation or depreciation during the year is a component of other
comprehensive income.
derivative
financial instrumentswe
record all derivative financial instruments on our balance sheet at fair value.
the accounting treatment for the gain or loss due to changes in the fair value
of these instruments is dependent on whether the derivative qualifies as a
hedge. if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge, the gains or losses are
included in our statement of operations as a realized gain or losswhen they occur. if the derivative
qualifies as a hedge, the accounting treatment varies based on the type of risk
being hedged. generally, however, the portion of the hedge deemed effective is
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, and the portion deemed ineffective
is recorded in the statement of operations as a realized gain or loss. to qualify
for hedge accounting treatment, the hedging relationship is formally documented
at the inception of the hedge detailing the risk management objectives and
strategy for undertaking the hedge. in addition, we assess both at the
inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis, whether the derivative is
highly effective in accomplishing the risk management objectives. if it is
determined that the derivative is not highly effective, hedge accounting
treatment is discontinued and any gains and losses associated with the hedges
ineffectiveness are recognized as a realized gain or loss in the
statement of operations. fair
value for our derivatives is based on quoted market rates or models obtained
from third party pricing services.
see note 7 for further
information regarding the types of derivative financial instruments that we
hold.
cash restrictions
lloyds solvency
requirements call for certain of our funds to be held in trust in amounts
sufficient to meet claims. these funds amounted to $30 million and $167 million
at december31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
goodwill and
intangible assets
in the first quarter of 2002, we adopted the
provisions of sfas no.141, business combinations (sfas no.141)
and sfas no.142, goodwill and other intangible assets, (sfas no.142).
in a business combination, the excess of the amount we paid over the fair value
of the acquired companys tangible net assets is recorded as either an
intangible asset, if it meets certain criteria, or goodwill. intangible assets
with a finite useful life (generally over four to 20 years) are amortized to
expense over their estimated life, on a basis expected to be consistent with
their estimated future cash flows. intangible assets with an indefinite useful
life and goodwill, which represents the excess purchase price over the fair
value of tangible and intangible assets, are no longer amortized, effective january1,
2002, but remain subject to tests for impairment. prior to our adoption of sfas
nos. 141 and 142, we amortized goodwill and intangible assets over periods of
up to 40 years, generally on a straight-line basis. see note 22 to the
consolidated financial statements included herein for further information
regarding goodwill and intangible assets included in our consolidated balance
sheet.
we evaluate our goodwill
for impairment on an annual basis. if an event occurs or circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below
its carrying amount, we will test for impairment between annual tests.
impairments of
long-lived assets
we monitor the
recoverability of the value of our long-lived assets to be held and used based
on our estimate of the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
disposition considering any events or changes in circumstances which indicate
that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. we monitor the
value of our long-lived assets to be disposed of and report them at the lower
of carrying value or fair value less our estimated cost to sell. we had no
impairment adjustments related to our long-lived assets in 2003, 2002 or 2001.
office properties
and equipment
we carry office properties
and equipment at depreciated cost. we depreciate these assets on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. the
accumulated depreciation for office properties and equipment was $517 million
and $504 million at the end of 2003 and 2002, respectively.
internally
developed software costs
we capitalize certain internally developed software
costs incurred during the application development stage of a project. these
costs include external direct costs associated with the project and payroll and
related costs for employees who devote time to the project. we begin to
amortize costs once the software is ready for its intended use, and amortize
them over the softwares expected useful life, generally five years.
at december31, 2003
and 2002, respectively, we had $73 million and $69 million of unamortized
internally developed computer softwarecosts.
for the years ended december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we recorded $18
million, $13 million and $7 million of amortization expense, respectively.
taxes
we account for income
taxes under the asset and liability method. deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income
tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and
laws. the deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net
change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year. the
current income tax provision generally reflects the tax consequences of
revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on income tax returns.
foreign currency
translation
we assign functional
currencies to our foreign operations, which are generally the currencies of the
local operating environment. foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the
functional currency, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are
reflected in the statement of operations. functional currency amounts are then
translated into u.s. dollars. the unrealized gain or loss from this
translation, net of tax, is recorded as a part of common shareholders equity. the
change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year,
net of tax, is a component of comprehensive income. both the remeasurement and
translation are calculated using current exchange rates for the balance sheets
and average exchange rates for the statements of operations.
stock option
accounting
we follow the provisions of accounting principles
board opinion no.25, accounting for stock issued to employees (apb 25),
fasb interpretation 44, accounting for certain transactions involving stock
compensation (an interpretation of apb opinion no.25), and other related
interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans utilizing the intrinsic
value method described in that literature. we also follow the disclosure provisions
of sfas no.123, accounting for stock-based compensation for our option
plans, as amended by sfas no.148, accounting for stock-based
compensationtransition and disclosure; an amendment of fasb statement no.123.
these require pro forma net income and earnings per share information, which is
calculated assuming we had accounted for our stock option plans under the fair
value method described in those statements.
had we
calculated compensation expense on a combined basis for our stock option grants
based on the fair value method described in sfas no.123, our net income
and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts as
indicated.

interest
and income taxes paidwe
paid interest on debt and distributions on redeemable preferred securities of
trusts of $179 million in 2003, $167 million in 2002 and $133 million in 2001.
we paid net federal income taxes of $62 million in 2003, and received refunds
of $100 million in 2002 and $54 million in 2001.
non-cash
investing and financing activitiesin july2002, we issued 8.9 million
equity units, each having a stated amount of $50. each equity unit included a
forward purchase contract on our common stock. related to these contracts, we
established a $46 million liability, with a corresponding reduction to
shareholders equity.
in november2002, concurrent with the transfer of
our continuing reinsurance operations as described in note 19, we received
warrants to purchase up to six million additional common shares of platinum
underwriters holdings, ltd. as partial consideration for the transferred
business. we carry the warrants as an asset on our balance sheet at their
market value, which was $65million and $61 million at december31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.
in september2001,
we received approximately 190 million old mutual plc ordinary shares as partial
consideration for the sale of our life insurance subsidiary to old mutual. the
shares were valued at $300million at the time of closing.
2 merger
agreement with the travelers property casualty corp.
on november17, 2003, the st. paul and travelers
property casualty corp. (travelers) announced the signing of a definitive
merger agreement that will create the st. paul travelers companies,inc. (st.
paul travelers), which would be the nations second largest property-casualty
insurer based on 2002a.m. best data concerning direct premiums written. the
merger agreement is filed as an exhibit to this report. the board of directors
of each company unanimously agreed to the tax-free, stock-for-stock merger (the
proposed merger or the merger). under the terms of the merger agreement,
adams acquisition corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the st. paul, will merge
into travelers, resulting in travelers becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the st. paul, and holders of travelers classa and classb common
stock will receive 0.4334 common share of the st. paul for each travelers share.
the st. paul expects to issue approximately 437 million shares of its common
stock in the proposed merger. the transaction is subject to customary closing
conditions, including the approval by shareholders of both companies as well as
certain regulatory approvals. special shareholder meetings to vote on the
proposed merger are scheduled for march19, 2004 in st. paul, mn and
hartford, ct. on december23, 2003, the federal trade commission granted
early termination of the waiting period required by the hart-scott-rodino
antitrust improvements act of 1976 in connection with the proposed merger. the
companies are seeking approval of the merger in 11 states and from various
foreign regulatory authorities. the transaction is expected to close in the
second quarter of 2004.
all information included in the consolidated financial
statements and notes to consolidated financial statements in this report
reflects only the results of the st. paul, and does not reflect any impact of
the proposed merger.
the
consummation of the merger would trigger a technical event of default under certain
of our credit agreements; however, the lenders have agreed to waive the
technical event of default, contingent upon the consummation of the merger.
3 segment
information
in the first
quarter of 2003, we revised our property-liability insurance business segment
reporting structure to reflect the manner in which those businesses are managed.
our property-liability underwriting operations consist of two segments
constituting our ongoing operations (specialty
commercial and commercial lines),
and one segment comprising our runoff operations (other). the composition of those respective segments is
described in greater detail below. the following is a summary of changes made
to our segments in the first quarter of 2003.
our
surety& construction operations, previously reported together as a
separate specialty segment, are now separate components of our specialty commercial segment.
our
ongoing international operations and our ongoing operations at lloyds,
previously reported together as a separate specialty segment, are now separate
components of our specialty commercial
segment.
our
health care, reinsurance and other operations, each previously reported as a
separate runoff business segment, have been combined into a single other runoff segment and are under common
management. runoff means that we have ceased or plan to cease underwriting
business as soon as possible.
the
results of our participation in voluntary insurance pools, as well as loss
development on business underwritten prior to 1980 (prior to 1988 for business
acquired in our merger with usf&g corporation in 1998), previously included
in our commercial lines segment,
are now included in the other segment.
in addition to our participation in voluntary insurance pools, this prior year
business included the majority of our environmental and asbestos liability
exposures. the oversight
of these exposures is the
responsibility of the same management team responsible for oversight of the
other components of the other segment.
in addition, in the fourth quarter of 2003, our specialty programs business center,
previously reported in our specialty commercial segment, was moved to our
commercial lines segment to more accurately reflect the manner in which this
business is underwritten and managed. all data for 2002 and 2001 included in
this report were restated to be consistent with the changes made to our segment
reporting structure in 2003.
in accordance with provisions of sfas no.131, disclosures
about segments of an enterprise and related information, since surety&
construction, international& lloyds, health care, and reinsurance
were reported as separate segments during 2002 and are considered to be of
continuing significance in analyzing the results of our operations, we continue
to separately present and discuss (as appropriate) in this report information
about those businesses for all years covered by this report.
our operations in runoff do not qualify as discontinued
operations for accounting purposes. for the year ended december31, 2003,
these runoff operations collectively accounted for $327 million, or 5%, of our
net earned premiums, and generated underwriting losses totaling $762 million
(an amount that does not include investment income from the assets maintained
to support these operations). for the year ended december31, 2002, these
runoff operations collectively accounted for $1.98 billion, or 26%, of our net
earned premiums, and generated underwriting losses totaling $874 million, an
amount that included a $585 million pretax loss provision related to the
western macarthur asbestos litigation settlement agreement. for the year ended december31,
2001, these runoff operations collectively accounted for $2.97 billion, or 40%,
of our net earned premiums, and generated underwriting losses totaling $1.87
billion, an amount that included a $735 million pretax loss provision to
strengthen prior-year loss reserves in our health care operation and $662
million of pretax losses related to the september11, 2001 terrorist
attack.
in addition to our property-liability business
segment, we also have aproperty-liability
investment operation segment, as well as an asset management segment, consisting
of our majority ownership in nuveen investments.
the accounting policies of the segments are the same
as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note 1
of this report. we evaluate performance based on underwriting results for our
property-liability insurance segments, investment income and realized gains for
our investment operations, and on pretax operating results for the asset
management segment. property-liability underwriting assets are reviewed in
total by management for purposes of decision-making. we do not allocate assets
to these specific underwriting segments. assets are specifically identified for
our asset management segment.
segment
informationafter
the revisions to our segment structure described above, our reportable segments
in our property-liability operations consisted of the following:
the specialty commercial segment includes our surety and
construction operations, our ongoing international& lloyds operations, and the
following nine specialty business centers that in total comprise the specialty
component of this segment: technology,
financial and professional services, marine, personal catastrophe risk, public
sector services, discover re, umbrella/excess& surplus lines, excess and surplus lines underwriting
facilities  and oil&
gas. these business centers are considered specialty operations
because each provides dedicated underwriting, claim and risk control services
that require specialized expertise and focuses exclusively on the respective
customers it serves. our surety business center underwrites surety
bonds, which are agreements under which one party (the surety) guarantees to
another party (the owner or obligee) that a third party (the contractor or
principal) will perform in accordance with contractual or legal obligations. the
construction business center
offers a variety of products and services, including traditional insurance
consisting of workers compensation, general liability
and
commercial auto coverages, and risk management solutions, to a broad range of
contractors and parties responsible for construction projects. our
ongoing international operations
consist of our specialty underwriting operations in the united kingdom, canada
(other than surety) and the republic of ireland, and the international
exposures of most u.s. underwriting business. at lloyds, our ongoing operations are comprised of the
following types of insurance coverage we underwrite mostly through a single
wholly-owned syndicate: aviation, marine, global property and personal lines.
the commercial lines segment focuses on
commercial clientele, and although we targetcertain
commercial customer groups and industries, we do not have underwriting, claim
or risk service personnel with specialized expertise dedicated exclusively to
these groups or industries. accordingly, the business centers within commercial
lines are not considered specialty businesses. the commercial lines segment includes our small commercial, middle
market commercial and property
solutions business centers, as well as the results of our limited
involvement in involuntary insurance pools. the small commercial business center services commercial firms
that typically have between one and fifty employees through its proprietary st.
paul mainstreet (sm) and st. paul advantage (sm)
products, with a particular focus on offices, wholesalers, retailers, artisan
contractors and other service risks. the middle
market commercial business center offers comprehensive insurance
coverages for a wide variety of manufacturing, wholesale, service and retail
exposures, as well as programs for selected industries that are national in
scope and have similar risk characteristics such as franchises and associations.
the majority of these programs were formerly classified as a separate specialty
programs business center in our specialty commercial segment but were
reclassified in 2003 to our middle market
commercial business center in the commercial lines segment to more
accurately reflect the manner in which this business is underwritten and
managed. this business center also offers loss-sensitive casualty programs,
including significant deductible and self-insured retention options, for the
higher end of the middle market sector. the property
solutions business center combines our large accounts property
business with the commercial portion of our catastrophe risk business and
allows us to take a unified approach to large property risks.
the other segment includes the results of the
lines of business we placed in runoff in late 2001 and early 2002, including
our former health care and reinsurance segments, and the results of the
following international operations: our runoff operations at lloyds, including
our participation in the insuring of the lloyds central fund; unionamerica,
the london-based underwriting unit acquired as part of our purchase of mmi in
2000; and international operations we decided to exit at the end of 2001. this
segment also includes the results of our participation in voluntary insurance
pools, as well as loss development on business underwritten prior to 1980
(prior to 1988 for business acquired in our merger with usf&g corporation
in 1998). in addition to our participation in voluntary insurance pools, this
prior year business includes the majority of our environmental and asbestos
liability exposures. our health care operation historically provided a wide
range of medical liability insurance products and services throughout the
entire health care delivery system. our reinsurance operations historically
underwrote treaty and facultative reinsurance for a wide variety of property
and liability exposures. as described in more detail in note 19 to the
consolidated financial statements herein, in november2002 we transferred
our ongoing reinsurance operations to platinum underwriters holdings, ltd.
in
2001, we sold our life insurance operations. those operations are accounted for
as discontinued operations and are not included in our segment data.
the summary below presents
revenues and pretax income from continuing operations for our reportable
segments. the revenues of our asset management segment include investment
income and realized investment gains. revenues reported for our insurance
underwriting segments represent earned premiums in those segments. the table
also presents identifiable assets for our property-liability underwriting
operation in total, and our asset management segment.

elimination of one-quarter
reporting lagsin
the first quarter of 2003, we eliminated the one-quarter reporting lag for our
underwriting operations at lloyds to coincide with the timing of reporting for
all of our other international operations. as a result, our consolidated
results for 2003 included the results of those operations for the fourth
quarter of 2002 and all quarters of 2003. the incremental impact on our
property-liability operations of eliminating the reporting lag, consisting of
the results of these operations for the three months ended december31,
2003, was as follows.

of the total net written premiums and underwriting

in 2001,
we eliminated the one-quarter reporting lag for our primary underwriting
operations in foreign countries (not including our operations at lloyds). as a
result, our consolidated results for 2001 include their results for the fourth
quarter of 2000 and all quarters of 2001. the incremental impact on our

reclassification of
lloyds commission expensesin 2003, we reclassified certain commission expenses
related to our operations at lloyds. in prior years, we determined commission
expense based on premiums reported by the lloyds market (net of commissions)
using an estimated average commission rate. until recently, gross premiums
(prior to reduction for commissions) were not readily available from the lloyds
market. in 2003, we began recording actual commission expense for our lloyds
business. we reclassified prior period results to record actual commission
expense on a basis consistent with that implemented in 2003. there was no
impact to net income or shareholders equity as previously reported for any
prior periods, because the reclassification had the impact of increasing
previously reported premiums and commission expense in equal and offsetting
amounts. for the year ended december31, 2003, this reclassification had
the impact of increasing both net earned premiums and policy acquisition costs
by $81 million compared with what would have been recorded under our prior
method of estimation. in addition, net written premiums increased by $116
million in 2003, (a portion of which was due to the elimination of the
one-quarter reporting lag). for the year ended december31, 2002, the
impact was an increase to both net earned premiums and policy acquisition costs
of $112 million and an increase to net written premiums of $91 million. for the
year ended december31, 2001, the impact was an increase to both net
earned premiums and policy acquisition costs of $112 million and an increase to
net written premiums of $132 million.

we continually monitor the difference between our cost
and the estimated fair value of investments, which involves uncertainty as to
whether declines in value are temporary in nature. if we believe a decline in
the value of a particular investment is temporary, we record the decline as an
unrealized loss in our common shareholders equity. if we believe the decline
is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the investment
and record a realized loss on our statement of operations. our assessment of a
decline in value includes our current judgment as to the financial position and
future prospects of the entity that issued the investment security. if that
judgment changes in the future, we may ultimately record a realized loss after
having originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary.
at december31,
2003 and 2002, the carrying value of our consolidated invested asset portfolio
included $0.95 billion and $1.03 billion of net pretax unrealized appreciation,
respectively. included in those net amounts were gross pretax unrealized losses
of $129 million and $208 million, respectively. the following tables summarize,
for all securities in an unrealized loss position at december31, 2003 and
2002, the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time
those securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position. the
cost of these investments represented approximately 16% of our investment
portfolio (at cost) at december31, 2003. the majority of unrealized
losses related to fixed income securities are issuer-specific rather than
interest rate-related.

included in gross realized
losses for our fixed income portfolio in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were impairment
write-downs totaling $17 million, $74 million and $77 million, respectively.
gross realized losses in our equity portfolio in 2003 and 2002 included impairment
write-downs of $6 million and $26 million, respectively. no such write-downs
occurred in 2001. in our venture capital portfolio, impairment write-downs
totaled $143 million, $122 million and $88 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. see note 1 for additional information regarding our accounting
policy for other-than-temporary investment impairments.
7 derivative financial instruments
derivative financial instruments include futures,
forward, swap and option contracts and other financial instruments with similar
characteristics. we have had limited involvement with these instruments,
primarily for purposes of hedging against fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. all investments, investment techniques and
risk management strategies, including the use of derivative instruments, have
some degree of market and credit risk associated with them. we believe our
derivatives market risk substantially offsets the market risk associated with
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market
prices. we seek to reduce our credit risk exposure by conducting derivative
transactions only with reputable, investment-grade counterparties, and by
seeking to avoid concentrations of exposure individually or with related
parties.
effective january 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions
of sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities, as amended (sfas no. 133). the statement requires the
recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance
sheet, carried at fair value. in accordance with the statement, derivatives are
specifically designated into one of three categories based on their intended
use, and the applicable category dictates the accounting for each derivative.
we have held the following derivatives, by category.
fair
value hedgesfor
the years ended december 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we have several pay-floating,
receive-fixed interest rate swaps, with notional amounts totaling $730 million,
$730 million and $230 million, respectively. they are designated as fair value
hedges for a portion of our medium-term and senior notes, which we have entered
into for the purpose of managing the effect of interest rate fluctuations on
this debt. the terms of the swaps match those of the debt instruments, and the
swaps are therefore considered 100% effective. the balance sheet impact for
year ended december 31, 2003, was a decrease of $19 million in the fair value
of the swaps and the related debt on the balance sheet, with the statement of
operations impacts offsetting. the impact for the years ended december 31, 2002
and 2001 from movements in interest rates were increases of $42 million and $8
million, respectively, in the fair value of the swaps and the related debt on
the balance sheet, with the statement of operations impacts offsetting.
in 2003, nuveen investments entered into a series of
interest rate swap transactions as hedges against changes in a portion of the
fair value of private placement debt. all of the interest rate swap
transactions were designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the changes in
fair value of the hedged portion of the private placement debt. certain of
these interest rate swap transactions were terminated. the cancellation of
these interest rate swap transactions resulted in a total gain of approximately
$4 million, which will be amortized over the term of the private placement
debt. at december 31, 2003, the remaining open interest rate swap transaction
had a notional amount of $50 million and had a fair value of less than
$100,000.
cash
flow hedgeswe
have purchased forward foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash
flow hedges. they are utilized to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates from our expected foreign currency payments, and
settlement of our foreign currency payables and receivables. for the years
ended december 31, 2003 and 2002 we recognized a loss of $4 million and a gain
of $1 million, respectively, on the cash flow hedges, which is included in
other comprehensive income (oci). the
comparable amount for the
year ended december 31, 2001 was a $2 million loss. the amounts included in oci
will be realized into earnings concurrent with the timing of the hedged cash
flows. we anticipate that a loss of approximately $1 million will be
reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. for the years ended
december 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 we recognized a gain of less than $1 million,
neither a gain nor a loss, and a loss of less than $1 million, respectively, in
the statement of operations representing the portion of the forward contracts
deemed ineffective.
in 2003, nuveen investments, in anticipation of the
private placement debt issuance, entered into two treasury rate lock transactions
with an aggregate notional amount of $100 million. these treasury rate locks
were designated as cash-flow hedges. the treasury rate locks were settled for
$1 million. we have deferred this loss in oci as the treasury rate locks were
considered highly effective in eliminating the interest rate risk on the
forecasted debt issuance. amounts accumulated in oci will be reclassified into
earnings commensurate with the recognition of the interest expense on the newly
issued debt.
the
accumulated changes in oci as a result of cash flow hedges for 2003 (net of
taxes) are summarized as follows.

non-hedge derivativeswe have other financial instruments that
are considered to be derivatives, but which are not designated as hedges. these
include our investment in stock purchase warrants of platinum, received as
partial consideration from the sale of our reinsurance business (see note 19),
stock warrants in our venture capital business and foreign exchange forward
contracts. for the years ended december 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 we recorded $7
million, $13 million and $3 million, respectively, of realized gains in
continuing operations related to those non-hedge derivatives. income from
discontinued operations relating to non-hedge derivatives associated with the
sale of our life insurance business included a loss of $22 million and a gain
of $17 million for the periods ending december 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

in 2003, the total of $646 million in provisions for
losses and lae for claims incurred in prior years included $350 million in our
health care operation, $108 in our runoff operations at lloyds and $88 million
in our runoff unionamerica operation. in 2002, the total of $999 million in
provisions for losses and lae for claims incurred in prior years included $472
million in our runoff other segment related to the western macarthur asbestos
settlement agreement, $217 million in our surety and construction operations in
our specialty commercial segment, $135 million in our runoff operations at
lloyds and $97 million in our runoff health care operation. in 2001, the $577
million provision to increase prior-year loss reserves was driven by a $735 million
provision recorded in our health care operation.
the $955 million of loss reserves sold shown in the
table consist of $944 million of reserves related to our sale of camperdown uk,
limited, and $11 million of reserves related to the sale of our insurance
operations in botswana. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements
for further information regarding these transactions.
health care exposures. at the end of
2001, we announced our intention to exit, on a global basis, all business
underwritten in our health care operation through ceasing to write new business
and the non-renewal of business upon policy expiration, in accordance with
regulatory requirements. in 2001, loss activity in this operation continued to
increase not only for the years 1995 through 1997, but also 1998, and early
activity on claims incurred in 1999 through 2001 indicated an increase in
severity for those years. those factors led to a much different view of loss
development in the health care operation, and resulted in a $735 million
provision to increase prior-year loss reserves.
during 2002, we concluded that the impact of settling
claims in a runoff environment in our health care segment was causing abnormal
effects on our average paid claims, average outstanding claims, and the amount
of average case reserves established for new claimsall of which are
traditional statistics used by our actuaries to develop indicated ranges of
expected loss. taking these changing statistics into account, we developed
varying interpretations of our data, which implied added uncertainty in our
evaluation of these reserves.
in the fourth quarter of 2002, we established specific
tools and indicators to more explicitly monitor and validate our key
assumptions supporting our health care reserve conclusions since our
traditional statistics and reserving methods needed to be supplemented in order
to provide a more meaningful analysis. the tools that were developed tracked
three primary indicators which are influencing our expectations and include: a)
newly reported claims, b) reserve development on known claims and c) the
redundancy ratio, comparing the cost of resolving claims to the reserve established
for that individual claim.these three indicators are related such that if
one deteriorates, additional improvement on another is necessary for us to
conclude that further reserve strengthening is not necessary.
during the first three quarters of 2003 we tracked
these three indicators. newly reported claims were better than expected,
reserve development on known claims was worse than expected and the redundancy
ratio was better than expected. not only was the redundancy ratio better than
expected, it improved in each of the first three quarters continually
offsetting any adverse reserve development on known claims. the combined impact
of these three indicators offset one another, and reserve levels were deemed
appropriate.
in the fourth quarter of 2003, the dollar amount of
newly reported claims totaled $65 million, approximately 24% better than we
anticipated in our original estimate of the required level of reserves at
year-end 2002. the dollar amount of newly reported claims for the year ended
december 31, 2003 was approximately 10% better than our original expectation.
we consider the assumptions we made at the end of 2002 for newly reported
claims to be appropriate and we have made no changes to those assumptions. loss
development on known claims during the fourth quarter of 2003 was only slightly
worse than anticipated. however, through all of 2003, the cumulative
development was considerably worse than expected. through the third quarter,
this adverse development on known claims was offset by continued improvement on
the actual redundancy ratio experienced and no adjustment had been needed.
however, our actual redundancy ratio, which had continually improved during the
first nine months of 2003, took an adverse turn during november and december, causing
the required reserve redundancy to increase above our level of tolerance. the
view that the redundancy ratio would not only fail to continue to improve, but
could likely decay over time, caused us to record a $350 million increase to
reserve levels. the new required redundancy ratio after the $350 million of
reserve strengthening recorded in the fourth quarter is in the range of 30% to
35% and allows for future inflationary effects.
the three indicators described above are related such
that if one deteriorates, additional improvement on another is necessary for us
to conclude that further reserve strengthening is not necessary. the results of these indicators support our
current view that we have recorded a reasonable provision for our medical
malpractice exposures as of december 31, 2003 and our analysis continues to
support our belief that we will realize favorable effects in our ultimate costs
and that our current loss reserves will prove to be a reasonable provision.
surety
exposures. within our surety operations, we have
exposures related to a small number of accounts which are in various stages of
bankruptcy proceedings. in addition, certain other accounts have experienced
deterioration in creditworthiness since we issued bonds to them. given the
current economic climate and its impact on these companies, we may experience
an increase in claims and, possibly, incur high severity losses. such losses
would be recognized in the period in which the claims are filed and determined
to be a valid loss under the provisions of the surety bond issued.
with regard to commercial surety bonds issued on
behalf of companies operating in the energy trading sector, our aggregate
pretax exposure, net of facultative reinsurance, is with five companies for a
total of approximately $367 million ($305 million of which is from gas supply
bonds), an amount that will decline over the contract periods. the largest
individual exposure approximates $181 million (pretax). these companies all
continue to perform their bonded obligations and, therefore, no claims have
been filed.
in addition to the exposures discussed above with
respect to energy trading companies and companies in bankruptcy, our commercial
surety business as of december 31, 2003 included seven accounts with gross
pretax bond exposures greater than $100 million each, before reinsurance. the
majority of these accounts have investment grade ratings, and all accounts
continue to perform their bonded obligations.
in 2003, we recorded a $59 million pretax loss
provision (net of reinsurance) related to one of our accounts that was in
bankruptcy and unable to perform its bonded obligations. in april 2003, a
bankruptcy court approved the sale of substantially all of the assets of the
account. following that approval, we received claim notices with respect to
approximately $120 million of bonds securing certain workers compensation and
retiree health benefit obligations of the account. we originally recorded a net
pretax loss provision of $89 million when the claim notices were received. in
the fourth quarter of 2003, we re-estimated the amount of reinsurance
recoverable related to that pretax loss, and recorded a $27 million reduction
in our net loss. conversely, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a $27 million
provision to strengthen our surety
operations prior-year loss reserves, primarily related to a re-estimation of
reinsurance recoverable related to losses incurred in 2002 associated with
enron corporations bankruptcy.
in the third quarter of 2003, we made collateralized
advances to a construction contractor that had failed to make payments under
certain of its debt obligations. these third quarter advances did not impact
our results of operations because the loss incurred was offset by our estimated
recoverable.
in recent months, the contractor has completed a
restructuring of its finances and entered into revised credit agreements with
its lenders. as part of our strategy to mitigate our ultimate exposure to this
account by facilitating the contractors efforts to complete bonded projects,
we made additional advances for which we recorded an after-tax loss, net of
estimated reinsurance and co-surety participation, of approximately $13 million
in the fourth quarter of 2003. we have not changed our estimate of the
recoverable from that established at the end of the third quarter of 2003. any
future changes in our estimate of the recoverable, whether positive or
negative, will affect our results of operations. we may make further advances
and, subject to our underwriting criteria, we may also decide to issue bonds
for new projects undertaken by this contractor.
if the contractor were to fail to complete its bonded
projects, we currently estimate that our aggregate additional loss, net of
estimated collateral, reinsurance recoveries and participation by co-sureties
(one of which has experienced ratings downgrades and is in runoff), would
likely not exceed $75 million on an after-tax basis, assuming a 35% statutory
tax rate. given the uncertainties relating to the contractors business and
other factors, there is no assurance that our estimate and our potential
exposure will not increase.
in 2003, we secured excess of loss reinsurance coverage
for our commercial surety exposures in the form of two new treaties providing
$500 million of aggregate loss limits over a five-year period, with a maximum
recovery of $100 million per principal for gas supply bonds and $150 million
per principal for other bonds. the reinsurance program does not extend coverage
to the small number of commercial surety accounts which were in bankruptcy at
the inception of the reinsurance treaties.
discontinued
operations. the activity on reserves of
discontinued operations represents certain activity related to the 1999 sale
of our standard personal insurance business. the reserve balances
associated with certain
portions of the business sold are included in our total reserves, but the
related incurred losses are excluded from continuing operations in our
statements of operations for all periods presented, and included in
discontinued operations. see note 17 for a discussion of reserve guarantees we
made related to this sale.
environmental
and asbestos reservesour
underwriting operations continue to receive claims under policies written many
years ago alleging injury or damage from environmental pollution or seeking
payment for the cost to clean up polluted sites. we have also received asbestos
injury claims tendered under general liability policies.
the
following table summarizes the environmental and asbestos reserves reflected in
our consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2003 and 2002. amounts in the
net column represent gross amounts reduced by consolidated reinsurance
recoverables. see note 20 for a discussion of a significant asbestos litigation
settlement agreement.

our historical methodology (through first quarter
2002) for reviewing the adequacy of environmental and asbestos reserves
utilized a survival ratio metric, which considers ending reserves in relation
to calendar year paid losses. when the environmental reserve analyses were
completed in the second quarter of 2002, we supplemented our survival ratio
diagnostics with additional detailed analyses, and concluded that our
environmental reserves were redundant by approximately $150 million. based on
our additional analyses, we released approximately $150 million of
environmental reserves in the second quarter of 2002. had we continued to rely
solely on our analysis of survival ratio, we would have recorded no adjustment
to our environmental reserves through the six months ended june 30, 2002.
in the second quarter of 2002, we also supplemented
our survival ratio analysis of asbestos reserves with a detailed claims
analysis. we determined that, excluding the impact of the western macarthur
settlement, our asbestos reserves were adequate; however, including that
impact, we determined that our asbestos reserves were inadequate. as a result,
gross and net asbestos reserves were increased $150 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2003, we updated our detailed
actuarial analysis for both asbestos and environmental reserves pertaining to
our exposure from direct policyholders and relied more heavily on these
analyses in determining the adequacy of our reserve provision for the remaining
unreported losses. for non-workers compensation asbestos claims we
supplemented this detailed analysis with an additional analysis to determine an
estimate of reserves specifically for policyholders who have not as yet
tendered their first asbestos claim. as a result of these studies we increased
net asbestos reserves by $77 million and net environmental reserves by $14
million. in addition, reviews of assumed and non-domestic exposures caused us
to increase net asbestos reserves by $13 million and reduce net environmental
reserves by $1 million.

if we believe that any of our deferred tax assets will
not result in future tax benefits, we must establish a valuation allowance for
the portion of these assets that we think will not be realized. the net change
in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was a decrease of $10
million in 2003, and an increase of $27 million in 2002, both relating to our
foreign operations. based predominantly upon a review of our anticipated future
earnings, but also including all other available evidence, both positive and
negative, we have concluded it is more likely than not that our net deferred
tax assets will be realized.
net
operating loss (nol) and foreign tax credit (ftc) carryforwardsfor tax return purposes, as of december31,
2003, we had nol carryforwards that expire, if unused, in 2005-2022 and ftc
carryforwards that expire, if unused, in 2005-2008. the amount and timing of
realizing the benefits of nol and ftc carryforwards depend on future taxable
income and limitations imposed by tax laws. the approximate amounts of those
nols on a regular tax basis and an alternative minimum tax (amt) basis were
$2.78 billion and $988 million, respectively. the approximate amounts of the
ftcs both on a regular tax basis and an amt basis were $27 million. the
benefits of the nol and ftc carryforwards have been recognized in our
consolidated financial statements.
undistributed
earnings of subsidiariesu.s. income taxes have not been provided on $75 million of
our foreign operations undistributed earnings as of december31, 2003, as
such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations. furthermore,
any taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits
against the u.s. tax on any dividend distributions from such earnings.
we have not provided taxes on approximately $483
million of undistributed earnings related to our majority ownership of nuveen
investments as of december31, 2003, because we currently do not expect
those earnings to become taxable to us.
irs examinationsthe internal revenue service has examined
our consolidated returns through 2000 and is currently examining the years 2001
through 2002. we believe that any additional taxes assessed as a result of
these examinations would not materially affect our overall financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

fully guaranteed by us. as a result, we deconsolidated these trusts, and now
report our borrowings from these trusts as debt on our consolidated balance
sheet. in years prior to 2003, the preferred securities issued by these trusts
and guaranteed by us were reported in our balance sheet as a separate line item
between total liabilities and shareholders equity, and referred to as company-obligated
mandatorily redeemable securities of trusts holding solely subordinated
debentures of the company. prior to 2003, the debt issued by us to the trusts
was eliminated in consolidation. the following is a summary of the provisions
of the five business trusts, each of which was formed for the sole purpose of
issuing those securities.
st.
paul capital trust i issued 23,000,000 preferred securities generating gross
proceeds of $575 million, the proceeds of which were used to purchase
subordinated debentures issued by us. we make quarterly interest payments at a
rate of 7.6% on the debentures, which have a mandatory redemption date of october15,
2050. the preferred securities issued by the trust in turn pay a quarterly
distribution at an annual rate of 7.6%. we can redeem the debentures on or
after november13, 2006. the proceeds of such redemption would be used by
the trust to redeem a like amount of its preferred securities.
mmi
capital trust i issued $125 million of preferred securities in 1997, the
proceeds of which were used to purchase subordinated debentures issued by mmi
corporation. we assumed the liability for these debentures upon our acquisition
of mmi in 2000. we make semi-annual interest payments at a rate of 7.625% on
the debentures, which have a mandatory redemption date of december15,
2027. the preferred securities in turn pay a preferred distribution of 7.625%
semi-annually in arrears. in 2002, we repurchased and retired $4 million of the
mmi trust preferred securities in an open market transaction.
usf&g
capital trusts i,ii and iii each issued $100 million of preferred
securities in 1997 and 1996, the proceeds of which were used to purchase
subordinated debentures issued by usf&g corporation, which made semi-annual
interest payments at rates of 8.5%, 8.47% and 8.312%, respectively. we assumed
the liability for these debentures upon our merger with usf&g corporation
in 1998. since the merger, we have repurchased and retired securities from each
trust from time to time in open market transactions. the debentures related to
the usf&g capital trust i,ii and iii have mandatory redemption dates
of december15, 2045, january10, 2027 and july1, 2046, respectively.
debentures related to each trust may, however, be redeemed earlier under
certain conditions that vary among the three trusts. the proceeds of such
redemptions would be used to redeem a like amount of each trusts preferred
securities.
our total distribution
expense related to all of these preferred securities prior to deconsolidation
was $70 million in 2002 and $33 million in 2001. in 2003, our interest expense
related to our debt to these trusts totaled $72 million.
description of
other debt securities
5.75%
senior notesin
march2002, we issued $500 million of senior notes due in 2007. proceeds
from the issuance were primarily used to repay a portion of our commercial
paper outstanding.
medium-term
notesthe
medium-term notes outstanding at december31, 2003 bear interest rates
ranging from 6.3% to 7.4%, with a weighted average rate of 6.8%. maturities
range from five to 15 years after the issuance dates. during 2003 and 2002,
medium-term notes having a par value of $67 million and $49 million, respectively,
matured, and payments at maturity were funded with internally generated funds.
5.25%
senior notesin
july2002, concurrent with the issuance of 17.8 million of our common
shares in a public offering, we issued 8.9 million equity units, each having a
stated amount of $50, for gross
consideration of $443
million. each equity unit initially consists of a forward purchase contract for
the companys common stock (maturing in 2005), and an unsecured $50 senior note
of the company (maturing in 2007). total annual distributions on the equity
units are at the rate of 9.00%, consisting of interest on the note at a rate of
5.25% and fee payments under the forward contract of 3.75%. the forward
contract requires the investor to purchase, for $50, a variable number of
shares of our common stock on the settlement date of august16, 2005. the
$46 million present value of the forward contract fee payments was recorded as
a reduction to our reported common shareholders equity in 2002. the number of
shares to be purchased will be determined based on a formula that considers the
average trading price of the stock immediately prior to the time of settlement
in relation to the $24.20 per share price at the time of the offering. had the
settlement date been december31, 2003, we would have issued approximately
15 million common shares based on the average trading price of our common stock
immediately prior to that date. the majority of proceeds from the offering were
contributed as capital to our insurance underwriting subsidiaries, with the
balance being used for general corporate purposes.
commercial
paperwe
maintain an $800 million commercial paper program with $600 million of back-up
liquidity, consisting entirely of bank credit agreements. interest rates on
commercial paper issued in 2003 ranged from 1.1% to 1.5%, in 2002 the range was
1.4% to 2.1%; and in 2001 the range was 1.1% to 6.7%.
nuveen
investments debtin
september2003, nuveen investments issued $300 million of 4.22% notes in a
private placement. the notes mature in 2008. a portion of the proceeds was used
to refinance existing debt and repay a $105 million loan from the st. paul. the
remainder will be used for nuveen investments general corporate purposes. the
$302 million carrying value of nuveen investments newly-issued debt in the
foregoing table included the unamortized gains from the cancellation of prior
interest rate swap transactions in connection with the private placement, as
well as unamortized private placement debt issue costs. nuveen investments
debt at december31, 2002 consisted of borrowings outstanding under its
revolving bank line of credit. at december31, 2002, the weighted average
interest rate on debt outstanding under the bank line of credit was
approximately 2.0%.
7.875%
senior notesin
april2000, we issued $250 million of senior notes due april15, 2005.
proceeds were used to repay commercial paper debt and for general corporate
purposes.

in april2000, we issued $250 million of senior notes due april15,
2010. proceeds were used to repay commercial paper debt and for general
corporate purposes.
zero
coupon convertible notesthe zero coupon convertible notes mature in 2009, but were
redeemable beginning in 1999 for an amount equal to the original issue price
plus accreted original issue discount. in addition, on march3, 1999 and march3,
2004, the holders of the zero coupon convertible notes had/have the right to
require us to purchase their notes for the price of $640.82 and $800.51,
respectively, per $1,000 of principal amount due at maturity.
718% senior notesthe 718% senior notes
mature on june1, 2005.
variable
rate borrowingsa
number of our real estate entities are parties to variable rate loan agreements
aggregating $64 million. the borrowings mature in the year 2030, with principal
paydowns starting in the year 2006. the interest rate is set weekly by a third
party, and was 1.65% at december31, 2003 and 2.05% at december31,
2002.
interest
rate swap agreementsat
december31, 2003 and 2002, we were party to a number of interest rate
swap agreements with a total notional amount of $730 million related to several
of our outstanding debt issues. the net effect of the swaps was to reduce our
interest expense in 2003 and 2002 by $32 million and $21 million, respectively.
the aggregate fair values of these swap agreements at december31, 2003
and 2002 were assets of $46 million and $65 million, respectively. the fair
value of
these swap agreements is
recorded on our balance sheet as an increase to other assets and a
corresponding increase to debt, with the statement of operations impacts
offsetting.
interest
expenseour
net interest expense on debt was $187 million in 2003, $112 million in 2002 and
$110 million in 2001. the 2003 total included interest expense on the debt
related to the five preferred security trusts no longer included in our
consolidated financial statements.
maturitiesthe amount of debt obligations, other than
commercial paper, that become due in each of the next five years is as follows:
2004, $55 million; 2005, $429 million; 2006, $59 million; 2007, $1,015 million;
and 2008, $450 million.
debt
covenant compliancewe
were in compliance with all provisions of our debt covenants as of december31,
2003 and 2002.
fair value of debt
obligationsthe
fair value of our commercial paper approximated its book value because of its
short-term nature. the fair value of our variable rate borrowings approximated
their book values due to the floating interest rates of these instruments. for
our other debt, which has longer terms and fixed interest rates, our fair value
estimate was based on current interest rates available on debt securities in
the market that have terms similar to ours.
preferred
shareholders equity
the preferred shareholders equity on our balance
sheet represents the par value of preferred shares outstanding that we issued
to our stock ownership plan (sop) trust, less the remaining principal balance
on the sop trust debt. the sop trust borrowed funds from a u.s. underwriting
subsidiary to finance the purchase of the preferred shares, and we guaranteed
the sop debt.
the sop trust may at any
time convert any or all of the preferred shares into shares of our common stock
at a rate of eight shares of common stock for each preferred share. our board
of directors has reserved a sufficient number of our authorized common shares
to satisfy the conversion of all preferred shares issued to the sop trust and
the redemption of preferred shares to meet employee distribution requirements.
upon the redemption of preferred shares, we will issue shares of our common
stock to the trust to fulfill the redemption obligations.
common shareholders
equity
common
stock and reacquired shareswe are governed by the minnesota business corporation act.
all authorized shares of voting common stock have no par value. shares of
common stock reacquired are considered unissued shares. the number of
authorized shares of the company is 480 million.
we reacquired approximately 13 million of our common
shares in 2001 for a total cost of $589 million. we reduced our capital stock
account and retained earnings for the cost of these repurchases. share
repurchases in 2003 and 2002 were minimal, primarily related to stock incentive
plans.
issuance of common sharesin july2002, we sold 17.8 million
of our common shares in a public offering for gross consideration of
$431million, or $24.20 per share.
a

articles of incorporation allow us to issue five million undesignated shares.
the board of directors may designate the type of shares and set the terms
thereof. the board designated 1,450,000 shares as seriesb convertible
preferred stock in connection with the formation of our stock ownership plan.
dividend restrictionswe primarily depend on dividends from our
subsidiaries to pay dividends to our shareholders, service our debt, and pay
expenses. st. paul fire and marine insurance company (fire and marine) is our
lead u.s. property-liability underwriting subsidiary and its dividend paying
capacity is limited by the laws of minnesota, its state of domicile. business
and regulatory considerations may impact the amount of dividends actually paid.
approximately $774 million will be available to us from payment of ordinary
dividends by fire and marine in 2004. any dividend payments beyond the $774
million limitation would require prior approval of the minnesota commissioner
of commerce. fire and marines ability to receive dividends from its direct and
indirect underwriting subsidiaries is subject to restrictions under the laws of
their respective states or other jurisdictions of domicile. during 2003, we
received dividends in the form of cash and securities of $625 million from our
u.s. underwriting subsidiaries. we received no cash dividends from our u.s.
property-liability underwriting subsidiaries in 2002. in 2001, we received
dividends in the form of cash and securities of $827 million from fire and
marine.
11 acquisitions& divestitures
acquisitions
in may2003, we purchased the right to seek
renewal of several lines of insurance business previously underwritten by
kemper insurance companies. the initial payment for this right was recorded as
an intangible asset (characterized as renewal rights) and is being amortized on
an accelerated basis over four years. the portfolio of business involved in
this transaction included the following lines: technology, small commercial,
middle market commercial, inland and ocean marine, and architects and
engineers professional liability. we did not assume any past liabilities with
this purchase; however, we will be obligated to make an additional payment in june2004
based on the amount of premium volume we ultimately renew during the twelve
month period subsequent to this purchase. we believe it is unlikely that any
additional payment would exceed $30 million. at december31, 2003, we had
accrued $10 million toward this additional obligation, recorded in other
liabilities. our consolidated gross
written premiums for the year ended december31, 2003 included
approximately $280 million attributable to business underwritten as a result of
this purchase of renewal rights, the majority of which were included in our
commercial lines segment.
professional and financial risk practice (profin)
businessin december2002, we
purchased the right to seek renewal of the financial and professional services
business previously underwritten by royal& sunalliance (rsa),
without assuming past liabilities. this business represents approximately $125
million in expiring premium. the nominal cost of the acquisition was recorded
as an intangible asset (characterized as renewal rights) and will be amortized
on an accelerated basis over four years.
st. paul guaranteein march2002,
we completed our acquisition of london guarantee insurance company (now
operating under the name st. paul guarantee), a canadian specialty
property-liability insurance company focused on providing surety products and
management liability, bond, and professional indemnity products. the total cost
of the acquisition was approximately $80 million. the preliminary allocation of
this purchase price resulted in $20 million of goodwill and $37 million of
other intangible assets. we recorded $13 million of the goodwill and $26
million of the intangible assets (characterized as present value of future
profits) in our surety& construction segment, with the remaining $7
million of goodwill and $11 million of the intangible assets in our
international and lloyds segment. the intangible asset is being amortized on
an accelerated basis over eight years. the acquisition was funded through
internally generated funds.
st. paul guarantees assets and liabilities were
included in our consolidated balance sheet beginning june30, 2002, and
the results of their operations since the acquisition date were included in our
consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended december31,
2002. st. paul guarantee produced net written premiums of $57 million and an
underwriting loss of $6 million since the acquisition date. in the fourth
quarter of 2002 we made a purchase accounting adjustment related to our
deferred tax assumptions, which decreased goodwill by $2 million.
firemans fund surety businessin december2001,
we purchased the right to seek to renew surety bond business previously
underwritten by firemans fund insurance company (firemans fund), without
assuming past liabilities. we paid firemans fund $10 million in 2001 for this
right, which we recorded as an intangible asset and which we are amortizing on
an accelerated basis over nine years. based on the volume of business renewed
during 2002, we made a modest additional payment to firemans fund in the first
quarter of 2003. that amount was also recorded as an intangible asset and is
being amortized on an accelerated basis over the remaining life of the
intangible asset.
pencoin january2001,
we acquired the right to seek to renew a book of municipality insurance
business from penco, a program administrator for willis north america inc., for
total consideration of $3.5 million, without assuming past liabilities. we
recorded that amount as an intangible asset and are amortizing it on an
accelerated basis over five years.
nwq investment management company, inc.in august2002, nuveen
investments purchased nwq investment management company,inc. (nwq), a
los angeles-based equity management firm, with approximately $6.9 billion in
assets under management at the time of acquisition. the cost of the acquisition
consisted of $120 million paid at closing and up to an additional $20 million
payable over five years. as of december31, 2003, nuveen investments had
$133 million recorded for goodwill and $19 million for the intangible asset,
net of accumulated amortization, related to nwq. the intangible asset relates
to customer relationships and is being amortized over nine years.
symphony asset managementin
july2001, nuveen investments purchased symphony asset management, llc (symphony),
an institutional investment manager based in san francisco, with approximately
$4 billion in assets under management at the time of acquisition. the 2001
preliminary allocation of the $208 million purchase price resulted in $151
million recorded as goodwill and $53 million recorded as other intangible
assets. in 2002, nuveen investments made a purchase accounting adjustment due
to a revision in the valuation of symphony, which resulted in a $9 million
decrease in the intangible recorded and a corresponding increase in the
goodwill recorded. as of december31, 2003, nuveen investments had $158
million recorded for goodwill and $39 million for net intangibles related to
symphony. the majority of the intangible assets related to customer
relationships that are being amortized over approximately 20 years.
divestitures
in december2003, we completed the sale of
camperdown uk limited, one of our lloyds corporate names and the vehicle for
our participation on the 2003 and prior year of account, to foltus investments
limited. we recognized a $2 million pretax gain on this transaction. at lloyds,
we underwrite business through a single syndicate (syndicate 5000) for which
we provide 100% of the capital. in 2003, fire and marine entered into a 100%
quota share reinsurance agreement directly with syndicate 5000 that in effect
transferred syndicate 5000s underwriting results for the 2003 year of account
to fire and marine. in order to continue our ongoing operations at lloyds, we
activated two corporate names that will be used for 2004 and future years of
account to underwrite syndicate 5000 business.
in october2003, we sold our subsidiary, octagon
risk services,inc., a claim management and consulting services company,
for proceeds of approximately $30 million. we recorded a pretax gain of $5
million on the sale.
in the third quarter of 2003, we sold our subsidiary
botswana insurance company ltd. for total proceeds of $11 million, and recorded
a pretax loss of less than $1 million.
in 2002, we sold our insurance operations in spain,
argentina and, in mexico, all of our operations except our surety business. proceeds
from these sales totaled $29 million and we recorded a pretax gain of $4
million related to the sales.
material guarantees or
indemnifications provided as part of these sales are discussed in note 16
commitments, contingencies and guarantees.
12 variable
interest entities
fin
46(r)in january2003, the fasb
issued fasb interpretation no.46, consolidation of variable interest
entities, which was replaced in december2003 (fin 46(r)). fin 46(r),
along with its related interpretations, requires consolidation of all variable
interest entities (vie) by the primary beneficiary, as these terms are
defined in fin 46(r). we began applying the consolidation requirements for new
vies in the first quarter of 2003. for vies created before january31, 2003, the effective date of adoption
was deferred until the first interim or annual period ending after december15,
2003 (for us, the first quarter of 2004), but early and partial adoption were
permitted.
we chose to partially adopt fin 46(r) under the early
adoption provisions in 2003, which resulted in us consolidating certain
entities (summarized below) that we had not previously consolidated. we are
still evaluating the implications of fin 46(r) on our participation in various
lloyds underwriting syndicates. upon partial adoption, we recorded a loss of
$21 million (net of a deferred tax benefit of $3 million) in our consolidated
statement of operations in 2003, classified as a cumulative effect of
accounting change and representing the cumulative impact of fin 46(r) on
periods prior to the july1, 2003 date of partial adoption.
the entities that we consolidated (or deconsolidated,
with respect to the preferred securities of trusts) under our partial adoption
of fin 46(r) were as follows.
investmentwe hold an investment in an
insurance company that provides insurance coverage to markets in baltimore and
washington d.c. our investment includes a substantial majority of the companys
convertible preferred stock, but none of its voting common stock. as a result
of our economic interest in the entity, we have the majority exposure to
variability through our preferred stock ownership and a loan to the company,
both of which are considered variable interests as defined in fin 46(r). accordingly,
we began consolidating this entity in the third quarter. the carrying value of
this investment at december31, 2003 was approximately $4 million.
municipal trustswe own interests in
various municipal trusts that were formed for the purpose of allowing us to
more flexibly generate investment income in a manner consistent with our investment
objectives and tax position. as of september30, 2003, there were 36 such
trusts, which held a combined total of $450 million in municipal securities, of
which eight had not been included in our consolidated financial statements
prior to our adoption of fin 46(r) because we did not hold majority ownership
in them. however, we do have the majority exposure to variability for these
trusts. therefore, we consolidated these eight trusts in 2003. the combined
carrying value of these trusts at december31, 2003 was $366 million.
venture capital entitiesin our venture
capital investment portfolio, we have numerous investments in small- to
medium-sized companies, in which we have variable interests through stock
ownership and, in some cases, loans. all of these investments are held for the
purpose of generating investment returns, and the companies in which we invest
span a variety of business sectors, including technology, telecommunications
and healthcare. as a result of our review of this portfolio, we identified
three entities that we are now consolidating under the provisions of fin 46(r).
the combined carrying value of these entities at december31, 2003 was $(5)million.
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trusts
holding solely subordinated debentures of the company (preferred
securities)these securities had a carrying value of $897 million, and prior
to september30, 2003 were classified as a separate line on our balance
sheet between liabilities and shareholders equity. these securities were
issued by five separate trusts that were established for the sole purpose of
issuing the securities to investors, and the securities were fully guaranteed
by us. at september30, 2003, we reclassified these securities to debt
in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheet, as newly required
under sfas 150, accounting for certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity, which generally required that
an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a
liability (or an asset in some circumstances). in the fourth quarter of 2003,
we determined that the provisions of fin 46(r) applied to the trusts that
issued these securities, and as a result we deconsolidated the trusts for financial
reporting purposes. the debt we issued to these trusts, previously eliminated
in the consolidation of our financial results, is now included in the debt
section of liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. the net impact of
de-consolidating these trusts was to increase our reported debt liabilities
outstanding by $928 million and eliminate the $897 million of preferred
securities issued by the trusts from our consolidated balance sheet. the
difference between the two amounts was comprised of the $31 million combined
equity interests we held in the deconsolidated trusts.
the
consolidation/deconsolidation of the foregoing entities had the net impact of
increasing (decreasing) the balance sheet and statement of operations captions
by the amounts indicated in the following table.

in addition to the
foregoing entities that were consolidated pursuant to fin 46(r), we also hold
significant interests in other variable interest entities for which we are not
considered to be the primary beneficiary, as follows.
we
have a significant variable interest in two real estate entities, but we are
not considered to be the primary beneficiary. the total carrying value of these
entities was approximately $48 million as of september30, 2003, which
also represents our maximum exposure to loss. the purpose of our involvement in
these entities is to generate investment returns.
we
also have certain remaining variable interests in camperdown uk limited, an
entity that we sold in 2003. we utilized this entity as one of our corporate
names and the vehicle for our participation at lloyds for 2003 and prior years
of account through a single syndicate (syndicate 5000). our variable interest
results from an agreement to indemnify the purchaser for losses arising out of
adverse changes in underwriting, foreign exchange and foreign tax results. the
maximum amount of this indemnification obligation is $203 million. in addition,
in 2003 we entered into a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement with syndicate
5000 that in effect transferred syndicate 5000s underwriting results for the
2003 year of account to us.
13 retirement
plans
defined benefit pension planswe maintain funded
defined benefit pension plans for most of our employees. these plans provide
benefits under three retirement benefit formulas: a traditional pension
formula, a cash balance pension formula and a cash balance retiree health
formula. for those employees who are in the traditional pension formula,
benefits are based on years of service and the employees compensation while
employed by the company. pension benefits generally vest after five years of
service.
for those employees covered under the cash balance
pension formula, we maintain a cash balance pension account to measure the
amount of benefits payable to an employee. for each plan year an employee is an
active participant, the cash balance pension account is increased for pay
credits and interest credits. pay credits are calculated based on age, vesting
service and actual pensionable earnings, and added to the account on the first
day of the next plan year. interest credits are added at the end of each
calendar quarter. these benefits vest after five years of service. if an
employee is vested under the cash balance
formula when their
employment with us ends, they are eligible to receive the formula amount in
their cash balance pension account.
the traditional pension plan and cash balance pension
formulas were amended effective january1, 2003, which reduced the
projected benefit obligation by $84 million at december31, 2002. in
addition, the postretirement medical plan was amended effective january1,
2003. as a result, postretirement life insurance coverage was eliminated for
active employees, and employees who were not within five years of retirement
eligibility were switched to the cash balance retiree health formula from the
traditional postretirement healthcare benefit plan. these actions reduced the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $22 million.
our pension plans are noncontributory. this means that
employees do not pay anything into the plans. our funding policy is to
contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements
of the employee retirement income security act that can be deducted for federal
income tax purposes. this may result in no contribution being made in a
particular year.
our pension plan measurement date is december31.
we maintain noncontributory, unfunded pension plans to
provide certain company employees with pension benefits in excess of limits
imposed by federal tax law. these unqualified pension plans are not material and
are not included in the tables that follow.
postretirement benefits other than pensionswe provide
certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees (and
their eligible dependents), who are in the traditional formula. we currently anticipate
that most covered employees will become eligible for these benefits if they
retire while working for us. the cost of these benefits is shared with the
retiree. the benefits are generally provided through our employee benefit
trust, to which periodic contributions are made to cover benefits paid during
the year. we accrue postretirement benefits expense during the period of the
employees service.
for those employees covered under the cash balance
retiree health formula, we maintain a cash balance retiree health account (health
account) to measure the amount of benefits payable to an employee. for each
plan year an employee is an active participant, the health account is increased
for pay credits and interest credits. pay credits are calculated based on
pensionable earnings up to the social security taxable wage base for the plan
year and added to the health account on the first day of the next plan year. interest
credits are added at the end of each calendar quarter.
these benefits vest after five years of service. if an

the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
for our u.s. plans only, is estimated based on the plans actual historical
return results, the expected allocation of plan assets by investment class,
market conditions and other relevant factors. we evaluate only whether the
actual allocation has fallen within an expected range, and we then evaluate
actual asset returns in total, rather than by asset class, giving consideration
to the fact that our equity investments have a higher volatility than our other
investment classes, which is consistent with the market in general.
a
health care inflation rate of 8.00% in 2003 was assumed to remain the same in
2004, decrease one percent annually to 5% in 2007 and then remain at that level.

our u.s. pension plan assets are invested in a prudent
manner for the exclusive benefit of the plan participants and beneficiaries. the
investment horizon is long-term; therefore the assets of the plan are intended,
over time, to satisfy the benefit obligations under the plan. risk tolerance is
established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded
status, and corporate financial condition. the asset mix guidelines have been
established and are reviewed quarterly. these guidelines are intended to serve
as tools to facilitate the investment of plan assets to maximize long-term
total return and the ongoing oversight of the plans investment performance. the
investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income
investments. furthermore, equity investments are diversified across u.s. and
non-u.s. stocks. other
assets such as partnerships and real estate are used judiciously to enhance
long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. investment risk is
measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through daily and monthly investment
portfolio review, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability
studies.

we do not expect to contribute to our pension plan or
our postretirement benefit plan in 2004.
our unqualified pension plan had a pretax accumulated
benefit obligation in excess of the recorded accrued pension cost totaling $6
million at december31, 2003. as a result, we accrued an additional
minimum liability of $4 million (after-tax) in the fourth quarter, with an
offsetting reduction to other comprehensive income in common shareholders equity.
on december8, 2003,
the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 (the act)
was signed into law. this act introduces prescription drug coverage under
medicare for medicare-eligible retirees beginning in 2006 as well as a federal
subsidy to certain sponsors of retiree health care plans. we anticipate that
the benefits we pay after 2006 will be lower as a result of the new medicare
provisions. however, the retiree medical obligations reported at december31,
2003 do not reflect the impact of this legislation. deferring the recognition
of the new medicare provisions impact is permitted by financial accounting
standards board staff position 106-1 as a result of open questions about some
of the new medicare provisions and a lack of authoritative accounting guidance
about certain matters. we chose to defer the implementation of the act pending
the issuance of final accounting guidance from the financial accounting
standards board. the final accounting guidance could require changes to
previously reported information. we will monitor the fasb deliberations and
account for the act based on the pronouncement expected to be issued.
stock ownership plan
as of january1,
1998, the preferred stock ownership plan (psop) and the employee stock
ownership plan (esop) were merged into the st. paul companies,inc.
stock ownership plan (sop). the plan allocates preferred shares semiannually
to those employees participating in our savings plus plan. under the sop, we
match 100% of employees contributions up to a maximum of 6% of their salary. we
also allocate preferred shares equal to the value of dividends on previously
allocated shares.
to finance the preferred
stock purchase for future allocation to qualified employees, the sop (formerly
the psop) borrowed $150 million at 9.4% from our primary u.s. underwriting
subsidiary. as the principal and interest of the trusts loan is paid, a pro
rata amount of our preferred stock is released for allocation to participating
employees. each share of preferred stock pays a dividend of $11.72 annually and
is currently convertible into eight shares of our common stock. preferred stock
dividends on all shares held by the trust are used to pay a portion of this sop
obligation. in addition to dividends paid to the trust, we make additional cash
contributions to the sop as necessary in order to meet the sops debt
obligation.
the sop (formerly the
esop) borrowed funds to finance the purchase of common stock for future
allocation to qualified participating u.s. employees. the final principal
payment on the trusts loan was made in 1998. as the principal of the trust
loan was paid, a pro rata amount of our common stock was released for
allocation to eligible participants. common stock dividends on shares allocated
under the former esop are paid directly to participants.
all common shares and the
common stock equivalent of all preferred shares held by the sop are considered
outstanding for diluted eps computations and dividends paid on all shares are
charged to retained earnings.
we follow the provisions
of statement of position 76-3, accounting practices for certain employee stock
ownership plans, and related interpretations in accounting for this plan. we
recorded expense of $13.8 million, $7.4 million and $0.5 million for the years
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

remaining unallocated preferred shares at december31, 2003 will be
released for allocation annually through january31, 2005.

14 stock
incentive plans
we have made fixed stock option grants to certain u.s.
and non-u.s.-based employees, as well as outside directors. these grants were
considered fixed because the measurement date for determining compensation
costs was fixed on the date of grant. in the past we have also made variable
stock option grants to certain company executives. these were considered variable
grants because the measurement date was contingent upon future increases in the
market price of our common stock. no variable stock options are currently
outstanding.
since the exercise price
of our fixed grants equals the market price of our stock on the day they are
granted, there generally is no related compensation expense for financial
reporting purposes. however, during 2002 and 2001, certain executives
outstanding options became subject to accelerated vesting and an extended life,
under the terms of the senior executive severance policy or employment
agreements, and we recorded compensation cost of $4 million and $16 million,
respectively. we have also recorded compensation expense (benefit) associated
with our variable options and restricted stock awards of $7 million, $9 million
and $(8)million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
fixed option grants
u.s.-based plansour fixed option grants for certain
u.s.-based employees and outside directors give these individuals the right,
once those grants are vested, to buy our stock at the market price on the day
the options were granted. fixed stock options granted under the stock incentive
plan adopted by our shareholders in may1994 (as subsequently amended and
restated) become exercisable no less than one year after the date of grant and
may be exercised up to ten years after grant date. options granted under our
option plan in effect prior to may1994 may be exercised at any time up to
10 years after the grant date. at the end of 2003, approximately 8.9 million
shares remained available for grant under our stock incentive plan.
non-u.s. plansin the past we had separate stock
option plans for certain employees of our non-u.s. based operations. the
options granted under these plans were priced at the market price of our common
stock on the grant date. generally, they can be exercised from three to 10
years after the grant date.
global stock option plan (gsop)in
the past, we had a separate fixed stock option plan for employees who were not
eligible to participate in the u.s. and non-u.s. plans previously described.
options granted to eligible employees under the gsop were contingent upon the
company achieving threshold levels of profitability, and the level of
profitability achieved determined the number of options granted. generally,
options granted under this plan can be exercised from three to 10 years after
the grant date. although options were granted under this plan in 2001 and 2000,
the company no longer expects to issue grants under this plan.
the
following table summarizes the activity for our fixed option plans for the last
three years. all grants were made at the market price on the date of grant.

restricted stock
and deferred stock awards
up to 20% of the 33.4 million shares authorized under
our 1994 stock incentive plan may be granted as restricted stock awards. the
stock for this type of award is restricted because recipients receive the stock
only upon completing a specified objective or period of employment, generally
one to five years. the shares are considered issued when awarded, but the
recipient does not own and cannot sell the shares during the restriction period.
during the restriction period, the recipient receives compensation in an amount
equivalent to the dividends paid on such shares. up to 5.3 million shares were
available for restricted stock awards at december31, 2003.
in 2002 we implemented the capital accumulation plan. under
this plan eligible employees may receive up to 25% of their annual bonus in the
form of restricted stock of the company. the company provides a matching
contribution of restricted stock at a 10 percent discount from the market price
on the date of grant. the restricted stock is generally subject to a two-year
vesting period. participation in this program is voluntary unless an employees
annualized base pay is greater than $100,000, is not retirement-eligible and
will not become retirement-eligible within two years of the date the bonus was
paid. the performance year to be measured is the current year, with expense
being recognized over the subsequent two years. for the 2003 performance year
grants, $10.2 million of expense will be recognized over the two-year vesting
period, beginning in 2004. for the 2002 performance year grants, $4.4 million
of expense will be recognized in 2004.
we also have a deferred stock award plan for stock
awards to non-u.s. employees. deferred stock awards are the same as restricted
stock awards, except that shares granted under the deferred plan are not issued
until the vesting conditions specified in the award are fulfilled. up to 3,000
shares were available for deferred stock awards at december31, 2003.
any outstanding unvested restricted shares granted in
2003 and prior under our u.s. plan will immediately vest upon consummation of
the proposed merger, which constitutes a change in control as defined by the
plan.
please refer to note 1 for
the pro forma information on stock option grants based on the fair value
method as described in sfas no.123.
15 reinsurance
the primary purpose of our ceded reinsurance program,
including the aggregate excess-of-loss coverages discussed below, is to protect
us from potential losses in excess of what we are prepared to accept. we expect
the companies to which we have ceded reinsurance to honor their obligations. in
the event these companies are unable to honor their obligations to us, we will
pay these amounts. we have established allowances for possible nonpayment of
amounts due to us. at december31, 2003 and 2002, our provision for
uncollectible reinsurance totaled $134 million and $122 million, respectively.
we report balances pertaining to reinsurance
transactions gross on the balance sheet, meaning that reinsurance
recoverables on unpaid losses and ceded unearned premiums are not deducted from
insurance reserves but are recorded as assets.
the largest concentration of our total reinsurance
recoverables and ceded unearned premiums at december31, 2003 and 2002 was
with general reinsurance corporation (gen re). gen re (with approximately 17%
and 19% of our recoverables at the end of 2003 and 2002, respectively) is rated
a++ bya.m. best, aaa by moodys and aaa by standard&
poors for its financial strength. approximately 6% of our reinsurance
recoverables and ceded unearned premiums at december31, 2003 were with
platinum underwriters holdings, ltd.
approximately 94% of our domestic reinsurance
recoverable balances at december31, 2003 were with reinsurance companies
having financial strength ratings of a- or higher by a.m best or standard&
poors, were from state sponsored facilities or reinsurance pools, or were
collateralized reinsurance programs associated with certain of our insurance
operations. we have an internal credit security committee, which uses a
comprehensive credit risk review process in selecting our reinsurers. this
process considers such factors as ratings by major ratings agencies, financial
condition, parental support, operating practices, and market news and
developments. the credit security committee convenes quarterly to evaluate
these factors and take action on our approved list of reinsurers, as necessary.
aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance
treatiesin 2001, we entered into two aggregate
excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties. under the terms of the reinsurance
treaties, we transferred, or ceded, insurance losses and loss adjustment
expenses to our reinsurers, along with the related written and earned premiums.
one of these treaties was corporate-wide, with coverage triggered when our
insurance losses and lae across all lines of business reached a certain level,
as prescribed by terms of the treaty. we did not cede any losses to the
corporate treaty in 2001, but we recorded a $34 million net detriment in 2001
related to a similar treaty we were party to in 2000, primarily due to
adjustments for cessions made in 2000. we were not party to such a treaty in 2003 or
2002. our reinsurance operation was party to a separate aggregate
excess-of-loss treaty in 2002 and 2001. the results of our reinsurance
operation in 2002 and 2001 included a $34 million detriment and a $159 million
benefit, respectively, related to those treaties. the detriment in 2002
primarily resulted from the commutation of a portion of the 2001 treaty. we did
not cede any losses to our reinsurance operations 2002 excess-of-loss treaty. the
2001 benefit resulted from losses ceded to the 2001 treaty.
the
effect of assumed and ceded reinsurance on premiums written, premiums earned
and insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses is as follows (including the
impact of the reinsurance treaties).

commitments
investment commitmentswe have long-term
commitments to fund venture capital investments totaling $792 million as of december31,
2003. of that amount, approximately $501 million of commitments are to fund
investments in st. paul venture capital vi, llc (fund vi), one of our
venture capital investment subsidiaries. additional
amounts have been committed to fund new and existing investments in
partnerships and certain other venture capital entities. our future obligations
as of december31, 2003 are estimated as follows.

generally, we expect that our obligations to make the
capital contributions listed in the table above will be largely funded by
distributions we receive from our venture capital investments. the maximum
amount of new capital we are obligated to contribute to satisfy those
obligations to fund vi in any calendar year without receiving any offsetting
distributions from our venture capital operation is $250 million and, on a
cumulative basis over the life of fund vi, no more than $325 million. in
addition, we can elect to discontinue funding fund vi at any time. if we do so,
we must contribute $250 million (not reflected in the table above) to a
termination fund and pay certain termination and management fees. alternatively,
once 70% of the fund vi capital has been committed, we must elect either to
commit a material amount of additional capital to a new venture capital fund or
agree to contribute an additional $150 million (not reflected in the table
above) to fund vi.
letters of creditin the normal course of business, we
enter into letters of credit as collateral, as required in certain of our
operations. as of december31, 2003, we had entered into letters of credit
with an aggregate face value of $944 million.

is conducted in rented premises. we also enter into leases for equipment, such
as office machines and computers. our total rental expense was $96 million in
2003, $86 million in 2002 and $83 million in 2001. certain leases are
noncancelable, and we would remain responsible for payment even if we stopped
using the space or equipment. on december31, 2003, the minimum rents for
which we would be liable under these types of leases are as follows: $113
million in 2004, $89 million in 2005, $76 million in 2006, $67 million in 2007,
$60 million in 2008 and $102 million thereafter. we are also the lessor under
various subleases on our office facilities. the minimum rentals to be received
under noncancelable subleases are as follows:
$19 million in 2004, $16 million in 2005, $15 million in 2006, $12
million in 2007, $12 million in 2008 and $14 million thereafter.
acquisition of symphonyas
of december31, 2003, our
asset management subsidiary, nuveen investments,inc., may be required to
make additional payments of up to $121 million related to their acquisition of
symphony, based on symphony reaching specified performance and growth targets. any
future payments will be recorded as additional goodwill.
acquisition
of renewal rightsin may2003, we entered into a
contingent consideration agreement as part of our purchase price of the right
to seek to renew certain business from kemper insurance companies (kemper). we
are obligated to make an additional payment in june2004 based on the
amount of premium volume we ultimately renew during the twelve months
subsequent to this purchase. we believe it is highly unlikely that any additional
payment would exceed $30 million. at december31, 2003, we had accrued $10
million toward this additional obligation, recorded in other liabilities.
sale of minetin may1997, we completed the
sale of our insurance brokerage operation, minet, to aon corporation. we agreed
to indemnify aon against any future claims for professional liability and
other
specified events that occurred or existed prior to the sale. we monitor our
exposure under these claims on a regular basis. we believe reserves for reported
claims are adequate, but we do not have information on unreported claims to
estimate a range of additional liability. we purchased insurance to cover a
portion of our exposure to such claims. under the sale agreement, we also
committed to pay aon commissions representing a minimum level of annual
reinsurance brokerage business through 2012. the maximum annual amount payable
to aon related to that commitment is $20 million. we also have commitments
under lease agreements through 2015 for vacated space (included in our lease
commitment totals above), as well as a commitment to make payments to a former
minet executive.
sale
of camperdown ukin
december2003, we sold our london subsidiary, camperdown uk. as part of
that sale, we have agreed to indemnify the purchaser in the event a specified
reserve deficiency develops, a reserve-related foreign exchange impact occurs,
or a foreign tax adjustment is imposed on a pre-sale reporting period. the
maximum amount of this indemnification obligation is $203 million, and is
included in the total sales of business entities reported below. we recorded
a fair value of $24 million in other liabilities for this indemnification. all
other guarantees related to this sale are also included in the total sales of
business entities reported below. at lloyds, we underwrite business through a
single syndicate (syndicate 5000) for which we provide 100% of the capital. in
2003, fire and marine entered into a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement
directly with syndicate 5000 that in effect transferred syndicate 5000s
underwriting results for the 2003 year of account to fire and marine.
joint
venturesour
subsidiary, fire and marine, is a party to five separate joint ventures, in
each of which fire and marine is a 50% owner of various real estate holdings
and does not exercise control over the joint ventures, financed by non-recourse
mortgage notes. because we own only 50% of the holdings, we do not consolidate
these entities and the joint venture debt does not appear on our balance sheet.
our maximum exposure under each of these joint ventures, in the event of
foreclosure of a property, is limited to our carrying value in the joint
venture, ranging individually from $6million to $27million, and
cumulatively totaling $58million at december31, 2003.
structured
settlementscertain settlements of claims under workers
compensation and other liability policies involve periodic payments to a
claimant for a number of years, usually funded through the purchase of an
annuity from a third party. as our primary obligation to pay has been
transferred to a third party, our historical practice has been to treat all
structured settlements as extinguishing our liability to the policyholder,
although in some cases we remain contingently liable in the event of any
defaults by the companies issuing the annuities. as of december31, 2003,
the outstanding balance of structured settlements for which we remain
contingently liable was approximately $1.59billion.
legal
mattersin
the ordinary course of conducting business, we (and certain of our
subsidiaries) have been named as defendants in various lawsuits. some of these
lawsuits attempt to establish liability under insurance contracts issued by our
underwriting operations, including liability
under environmental protection laws and for injury caused by exposure to
asbestos products. plaintiffs in these lawsuits are seeking money damages that
in some cases are substantial or extra contractual in nature or are seeking to
have the court direct the activities of our operations in certain ways.
although the ultimate outcome of these matters is not
presently determinable, it is possible that the resolution of one or more matters
may be material to our results of operations; however, we do not believe that
the total amounts that we and our subsidiaries will ultimately have to pay in
all of these lawsuits will have a material effect on our liquidity or overall
financial position.
the following is a
summary of certain litigation matters with contingencies:
asbestos settlement agreementon june3, 2002, we announced
that we and certain of our subsidiaries had entered into an agreement settling
all existing and future claims arising from any insuring relationship of united
states fidelity and guaranty company, st. paul fire and marine insurance
company and their affiliates and subsidiaries, including us, with any of
macarthur company, western macarthur company, and western asbestos company. in january2004,
the u.s. bankruptcy court for the northern district of california issued an
order approving the settlement agreement with the macarthur companies, and
confirming the macarthur companies proposed plan of reorganization. see discussion in note 20.
petrobras oil rig constructionin september2002, the united
states district court for the southern district of new york entered a judgment
in the amount of approximately $370 million to petrobras, an energy company
that is majority-owned by the government of brazil, in a claim related to the
construction of two oil rigs. one of our subsidiaries provided a portion of the
surety coverage for that construction. as a result, we recorded a pretax loss
of $34 million ($22 million after-tax) in 2002 in our surety&
construction business segment. the loss recorded was net of reinsurance and
previously established case reserves for this exposure, and prior to any
possible recoveries related to indemnity. we continue to actively pursue an
appeal of this judgment.
purported classaction shareholder lawsuitsin the fourth quarter of 2002,
several purported class action lawsuits were filed against our chief executive
officer, our chief financial officer, and us. in the first quarter of 2003, the
lawsuits were consolidated into a single action, which makes various
allegations relating to the adequacy of our previous public disclosures and
reserves relating to the western macarthur asbestos litigation, and seeks
unspecified damages and other relief. in the fourth quarter of 2003, we agreed
in principle to a settlement, which is subject to certain customary conditions
and subject to court approval. if the settlement is consummated, it will result
in our payment of an amount that is not material to our results of operations.
boson v. union carbide
corp., et al; abernathy v. ace american ins. coin 2003, lawsuits were filed in
texas and ohio against certain of our subsidiaries, and other insurers and
non-insurer corporate defendants, asserting liability for failing to warn of
the dangers of asbestos. it is difficult to predict the outcome for financial
exposure represented by this type of litigation in light of the broad nature of
the relief requested and the novel theories asserted. we believe, however, that
the cases are without merit and we intend to contest them vigorously. in this
regard, we filed special exceptions in all of the texas cases. in october2003,
a court ruled on the special exceptions in 11 of those cases, dismissing the
cases with prejudice. subsequently, the court dismissed another case on the
same grounds. we view these as significant rulings in our favor. the special
exceptions in the remaining 50 cases have not yet been ruled upon. we intend to
file similar motions to dismiss in the ohio cases.
world trade center litigationin 2002, we and certain other
insurers obtained a summary judgment ruling that the world trade center (wtc)
property loss on september11, 2001 was a single occurrence. certain
insureds, including the wtcs leaseholder, appealed that ruling, asking the
court to determine that the property loss constituted two separate occurrences
rather than one. in september2003, the u.s. circuit court of appeals for
the second circuit ruled that under terms of the policy form we used to
underwrite property coverage for the wtc, the terrorist attack constituted one
occurrence.
farina v. travelers property casualty corp., et ala purported class action was
recently filed in connecticut state court against travelers property casualty
corp. and its board of directors alleging that they breached their fiduciary
duties to travelers shareholders in connection with the adoption of the merger
and the merger agreement with the company. the complaint seeks injunctive
relief
as well as unspecified
monetary damages. the complaint also names the company and its subsidiary adams
acquisition corp. as defendants, alleging that they aided and abetted the
alleged breach of fiduciary duty. we believe this suit is wholly without merit
and intend to vigorously defend against it.
guarantees
agency
loanswe have provided guarantees for
certain agency loans in order to enhance the business operations and
opportunities of several of the insurance agencies with which we do business. as
of december31, 2003, these loans had an aggregate outstanding balance of
approximately $6 million. we have guaranteed the lending institutions that we
will pay up to the entire principal amount outstanding in case of any agency
defaults, plus any reasonable costs associated with the default. there are
varying terms on the loans, and the guarantees are in place until the loans are
paid in full.
corporate
securitiesthrough the issuance of our debt
securities, we have guaranteed to indemnify the financial institutions against any
loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense, including taxes that may arise out
of the administration of the debt arrangement. there are no contractual
monetary limits placed on these guarantees, and they survive until the
applicable statutes of limitation expire.
venture
capitalour subsidiary, st. paul venture
capital vi, llc has guaranteed third party loans in the aggregate amount of
approximately $1 million. in the event that the borrower would default, st.
paul venture capital has guaranteed payment up to the aforementioned limits,
plus any costs, fees, and expenses that the lending institution might incur in
the administration of the default on the loans. these guarantees are in place
until the loans are paid in full.
swap
agreementswe are party to a number of
interest rate swaps. each party to a standard swap agreement agrees to
indemnify the other for tax liabilities that may arise out of the swap
transactions. we have no way to value the potential liability or asset that may
arise due to these tax issues, and there are no contractual monetary limits
placed on these indemnifications.
platinum
transactionin connection with the platinum
transaction, (see note 19) we entered into a series of servicing agreements
with platinum relating to the transfer of our 2002 reinsurance business. such
agreements provide general indemnification obligations on each of the parties
with respect to representations, warranties and covenants made under the terms
of each of the agreements. generally, the indemnification obligations of each
party are capped at the aggregate of all fees received by each party. these
indemnifications survive until the applicable statutes of limitation expire. in
addition, we agreed to provide indemnification to platinum and its
subsidiaries, directors and employees for losses incurred due to inaccurate or
omitted information in certain sections of the platinum registration statements
and prospectuses used in connection with platinums initial public offering of
securities, or the private placement memorandum used in connection with
platinums private offering of securities to renaissance reinsurance. we also
agreed to make certain payments to the underwriters of the platinum public
offerings if platinum fails to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to
them in specified circumstances. our obligations pursuant to these indemnities
have an aggregate limit of $400 million, which amount will be reduced by any
payments we make to investors in the public or private offerings. the
obligation to indemnify platinum and its subsidiaries, directors and employees
expires on november1, 2004.
sales
of business entitiesin the ordinary course of selling
business entities to third parties, we have agreed to indemnify purchasers for
losses arising out of breaches of representations and warranties with respect
to the business entities being sold, covenants and obligations of us and/or our
subsidiaries following the closing, and in certain cases obligations arising
from undisclosed liabilities, adverse reserve development, premium deficiencies
or certain named litigation. such indemnification provisions generally survive
for periods ranging from 12 months following the applicable closing date to the
expiration of the relevant statutes of limitation, or in some cases agreed upon
term limitations. as of december31, 2003,
the aggregate amount of
our quantifiable indemnification obligations in effect for sales of business
entities was $2.2 billion, with a deductible amount of $72 million. the
deductible amount represents an aggregate minimum threshold which our
obligations must exceed before we would be obligated to make any payments.
in addition, we have agreed to provide indemnification
to third party purchasers for certain losses associated with sold business entities
that are not limited by a contractual monetary amount. as of december31,
2003, we had outstanding unlimited indemnification obligations in connection
with the sales of certain of our business entities for tax liabilities arising
prior to a purchasers ownership of an entity, losses arising out of employee
matters relating to acts or omissions of such business entity or us prior to
the closing, losses resulting out of such sold business entities being deemed
part of the st. paul group prior to their respective sales to third parties for
purposes of internal revenue code section412 or title iv of erisa, and in
some cases losses arising from certain litigation and undisclosed liabilities. these
indemnification obligations survive until the applicable statutes of limitation
expire, or until the agreed upon contract terms expire.
otherwe have guaranteed
to indemnify the holders of the mandatorily redeemable trust preferred
securities in the event those trusts default. the entire amount of that
obligation is included in our consolidated debt obligations.
17 discontinued operations
life
insurancein september2001, we
completed the sale of our life insurance company, fidelity and guaranty life
insurance company and its subsidiary, thomas jefferson life (together, f&g
life) to old mutual plc (old mutual), for $335 million in cash and $300
million in ordinary shares of old mutual. in june2002, we sold all of the
old mutual shares we were holding for a total net consideration of $287
million, resulting in a pretax realized loss of $13 million that was recorded
as a component of discontinued operations on our statement of operations in
2002. at the time of the sale of the old mutual shares, there was a derivative collar
agreement in place that would have determined any possible adjustment to the
original f&g life sale price one year after the closing date. the collar was recorded on our balance sheet
as an asset and had a fair value of $12 million when we sold our old mutual
shares. we agreed to terminate the collar at no value as part of the sale of
our old mutual shares. that $12 million pretax loss was also included in
discontinued operations on our statement of operations in 2002.
at the time of the sale of f&g life in 2001, we
recorded a net after-tax loss of $74 million on the sale proceeds. that loss
was combined with f&g lifes results of operations prior to sale for an
after-tax loss of $55 million and was included in the reported loss from
discontinued operations for the year ended december31, 2001.
in september2001, we sold american continental
life insurance company, a small life insurance company we had acquired as part
of our mmi purchase, to cna financial corporation. we received cash proceeds of
$21million, and recorded a net after-tax loss on the sale of
$1million.
standard
personal insurancein 1999, we sold our standard
personal insurance operations to metropolitan property and casualty insurance
company (metropolitan). metropolitan purchased economy fire&
casualty company and subsidiaries (economy), and the rights and interests in
those non-economy policies constituting the remainder of our standard personal
insurance operations. those rights and interests were transferred to
metropolitan by way of a reinsurance and facility agreement. we guaranteed the
adequacy of economys loss and loss expense reserves, and we remain liable for
claims on non-economy policies that result from losses occurring prior to the september30,
1999 closing date. under the reserve-related agreements, we agreed to pay for
any deficiencies in those reserves and would share in any redundancies that
developed by september30, 2002. any losses incurred by us under these
agreements were reflected in discontinued operations in the period during which
they were incurred. at
december31, 2002,
our analysis indicated that we owed metropolitan $13 million related to the
reserve agreements, which was paid in april2003. we have no other
contingent liabilities related to this sale.
nonstandard
auto insuranceprudential purchased our
nonstandard auto insurance business marketed under the victoria financial and
titan auto brands for $175 million in cash (net of a $25 million dividend paid
by these operations to our property-liability insurance operations prior to
closing). we recorded an estimated after-tax loss of $83 million on the sale in
1999, representing the estimated excess of carrying value of these entities at
closing date over proceeds to be received from the sale, plus estimated income
through the disposal date. this excess primarily consisted of goodwill. we
recorded an after-tax loss on disposal of $9 million in 2000, primarily
representing additional losses incurred through the disposal date in may, and
an additional after-tax loss on disposal of $5 million in 2001, primarily
representing tax adjustments made to the sale transaction.
minetin 1997, we sold our
insurance brokerage operation, minet holdings plc (minet) to aon corporation.
we recorded expenses in discontinued operations in each of the last three years
related to the minet sale. in 2003, the expense recorded primarily represented
an adjustment to the tax provision on the sale, whereas the expenses recorded
in 2002 and 2001 primarily represented additional funds due aon pursuant to
provisions of the sale agreement.
the
following table summarizes our discontinued operations, including our life
insurance business, our standard personal insurance business, our nonstandard
auto business and our insurance brokerage business, minet (sold in 1997), for each
year in the three-year period ended december31, 2003.

18 restructuring
and other charges
december
2001 strategic
reviewin december2001, we announced the results of a
strategic review of all of our operations, which included a decision to exit
all business underwritten in our health care operations, narrow the product
offerings of our reinsurance operation, exit certain business at lloyds and
cease to underwrite business in several countries where we were unlikely to
achieve competitive scale. related to this strategic review, we wrote off $73
million of goodwill, and we recorded a pretax charge of $62 million, including
$46 million of employee-related costs, $9 million of occupancy-related costs,
$4million of
equipment charges and $3 million of legal costs. the $62 million pretax charge
was included in operating and administrative expenses in our 2001 statement
of operations; with $42 million included in property-liability insuranceother
and $20 million included in parent company, other operations and consolidating
eliminations in the table titled income (loss) from continuing operations
before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change in note 3 to
the consolidated financial statements.
the employee-related costs represent severance and
related benefits such as outplacement services to be paid to, or incurred on
behalf of, employees to be terminated by the end of 2002. we estimated that a
total of approximately 1,200 employees would ultimately be terminated under
this action, with approximately 800 employees expected to be terminated by the
end of 2002. the remaining 400 employees were not included in the restructuring
charge since they would either be terminated after 2002 or were part of one of
the operations that was to be sold. of the total, approximately 650 worked in
offices outside the u.s. (some of which have now been closed), approximately
300 worked in our health care business (which was exited), and the remaining
250 were spread throughout our domestic operations. a total of 713 of the
estimated 800 positions were eliminated. the remaining 87 positions represented
employees who found alternate positions within the company or external
employment before termination.
the occupancy-related cost represents excess space
created by the terminations, calculated by determining the anticipated excess
space, by location, as a result of the terminations. the percentage of excess
space in relation to the total leased space was then applied to the current
lease costs over the remaining lease period. the amounts payable under the
existing leases were not discounted, and sublease income was included in the
calculation only for those locations where sublease agreements were in place. the
equipment costs represent the net book value of computer and other equipment
that will no longer be used following the termination of employees and closing
of offices. the legal costs represented our estimate of fees to be paid to
outside legal counsel to obtain regulatory approval to exit certain states or
countries.

other
restructuring chargessince 1997, we have recorded in
continuing operations four other restructuring charges related to actions taken
to improve our operations.
related to our april2000 purchase of mmi, we
recorded a charge of $28 million, including $4 million of employee-related
costs and $24 million of occupancy-related costs. the employee-related costs
represented severance and related benefits such as outplacement counseling to
be paid to, or incurred on behalf of, terminated employees. we estimated that
approximately 130 employee positions would be eliminated, at all levels
throughout mmi, and 119 employees were terminated. the occupancy-related cost
represented excess space created by the terminations, calculated by determining
the percentage of anticipated excess space, by location, and the current lease
costs over the remaining lease period. the amounts payable under the existing
leases were not discounted, and sublease income was included in the calculation
only for those locations where sublease agreements were in place.
in august1999, we announced a cost reduction
program designed to enhance our efficiency and effectiveness in a highly
competitive environment. in the third quarter of 1999, we recorded a pretax
charge of $60 million related to this program, including $25 million in
employee-related charges related to the termination of approximately 590
employees, $33 million in occupancy-related charges and $2 million in equipment
charges.
late in the fourth quarter of 1998, we recorded a
pretax restructuring charge of $34 million. the majority of the charge, $26
million, related to the termination of approximately 500 employees, primarily
in our commercial insurance operations. the remaining charge of $8 million
related to costs to be incurred to exit lease obligations.
in connection with our merger with usf&g, in the
second quarter of 1998 we recorded a pretax charge to net income of $292
million, primarily consisting of severance and other employee-related costs
related to the termination of approximately 2,200 positions, facilities exit
costs, asset impairments and transaction costs.
all actions have been taken and all obligations have
been met regarding these other restructuring charges, with the exception of
certain remaining lease commitments. the lease commitment charges related to
excess space created by the cost reduction actions. the charge was calculated
by determining the percentage of anticipated excess space, by location, and the
current lease costs over the remaining lease period. the amounts payable under
the existing leases were not discounted, and sublease income was included in
the calculation only for those locations where sublease agreements were in
place.
we
expect to be obligated under certain lease commitments for approximatelysix years. the following presents a
rollforward of activity related to these commitments.

19 transfer of ongoing reinsurance
operations to platinum underwriters holdings, ltd.
on november1, 2002, we completed the transfer of
our continuing reinsurance business (previously operating under the name st.
paul re) and certain related assets, including renewal rights, to platinum
underwriters holdings, ltd. (platinum), a bermuda company formed in 2002 that
underwrites property and casualty reinsurance on a worldwide basis.
as part of this transaction, we contributed $122
million of cash to platinum and transferred $349 million in assets relating to
the insurance reserves that we also transferred. in exchange, we acquired six
million common shares, representing a 14% equity ownership interest in
platinum, and a ten-year option to buy up to six million additional common
shares at an exercise price of $27 per share, which represents 120% of the
initial public offering price of platinums shares.
in conjunction with the transfer of our continuing
reinsurance business to platinum, we entered into various agreements with
platinum and its subsidiaries, including quota share reinsurance agreements by
which platinum reinsured substantially all of the reinsurance contracts entered
into by st. paul re on or after january1, 2002. this transfer (based on september30,
2002 balances) included $125 million of unearned premium reserves (net of
ceding commissions), $200 million of existing loss and loss adjustment expense
reserves and $24 million of other reinsurance-related liabilities. the transfer
of unearned premium reserves to platinum was accounted for as prospective
reinsurance, while the transfer of existing loss and loss adjustment expense
reserves was accounted for as retroactive reinsurance.
as noted above, the transfer of reserves to platinum
at the inception of the quota share reinsurance agreements was based on the september30,
2002 balances. in march2003, we transferred to platinum $137 million of
additional insurance reserves, consisting of $72 million in unearned premiums
(net of ceding commissions) and $65 million in existing reserves for losses and
loss adjustment expenses. we also transferred cash and other assets having a
value equal to the additional insurance reserves transferred. this transfer of
additional assets and liabilities reflected business activity between september30,
2002 and the november2, 2002 inception date of the quota share
reinsurance agreements, and our estimate of amounts due under the adjustment
provisions of the quota share reinsurance agreements. our insurance reserves at
december31, 2002 included our estimate, at that time, of amounts due to
platinum under the quota share reinsurance agreements, which totaled $54
million. the $83 million increase in our estimate of amounts due to platinum under
the quota share reinsurance agreements resulted in a pretax underwriting loss
of $6 million in the first quarter of 2003. during the second quarter of 2003,
we reached final agreement with platinum regarding the adjustment provisions of
the quota share reinsurance agreements and no further adjustments to the
transferred assets and liabilities will occur.
for business underwritten in the united states and the
united kingdom, until october31, 2003, platinum had the right to
underwrite specified reinsurance business on our behalf in cases where platinum
was unable to underwrite that business because it had yet to obtain necessary
regulatory licenses or approval to do so, or platinum had not yet been approved
as a reinsurer by the ceding company. we entered into this agreement solely as
a means to accommodate platinum through a transition period. any business
written by platinum on our policy forms during this transition period was fully
ceded to platinum under the quota share reinsurance agreements.
under the
quota share reinsurance agreements with platinum, we ceded the following
amounts to platinum in 2003.

the transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $29
million and an after-tax loss of $54 million in the year ended december31,
2002. the after-tax loss was driven by the write-off of approximately $73
million in
deferred tax assets
associated with previously incurred losses related to st. paul res united
kingdom-based operations, as well as approximately $10 million in taxes
associated with the pretax gain.
our investment in platinum
is included in other investments. the
income from our 14% proportionate equity ownership in platinum is included in
our statement of operations as a component of net investment income from the
date of closing. our warrants to purchase additional platinum shares are
carried at their market value ($65 million and $61 million at december31,
2003 and 2002, respectively), with changes in their fair value recorded as
other realized gains or losses in our statement of operations. in 2003 and
2002, we recorded net pretax realized gains of $4 million and $7 million,
respectively, related to this option.

on june3, 2002, we announced that we and certain
of our subsidiaries had entered into an agreement settling all existing and
future claims arising from any insuring relationship of united states fidelity
and guaranty company (usf&g), st. paul fire and marine insurance company
and their affiliates and subsidiaries, including us (collectively, the usf&g
parties) with any of macarthur company, western macarthur company (western
macarthur), and western asbestos company (western asbestos) (together, the macarthur
companies).
on march26, 2002, a trial commenced in the
western macarthur litigation which was planned to occur in three phases over
the course of approximately one year, and which involved complex questions of fact
and law. among the issues to be addressed in the first phase of the trial were
the standing of western macarthur to recover under western asbestos policies
issued by usf&g (usf&g never insured western macarthur and disputed
western asbestos purported assignment of its insurance rights to western
macarthur) and the existence and terms and conditions of the policies,
including the issue of whether the policies contained products hazard coverage
and, if so, whether the policies included aggregate limits for products hazard
liability. usf&g believed it had, and continues to believe that it has,
meritorious defenses to the purported assignments of insurance rights by
western asbestos to western macarthur, which western macarthur alleged occurred
in the 1967-1970 time period and in 1997, and which were allegedly ratified in
1999. usf&g also believed that it had a strong position that the policies
did not contain products hazard coverage, but that even if they did the
coveragewas subject to products
hazard aggregates, which limited the usf&g parties exposure. as the trial
began, the company believed that it could resolve the case by litigation or
settlement within the existing asbestos reserves (gross asbestos reserve
totaled $478 million as of december31, 2001) on the basis of the
foregoing defenses, a belief supported by western macarthurs november1999
settlement of a similar claim brought against another defendant insurer for
$26million. given the facts and circumstances known by management at the
time we filed our annual report on form10-k, we believed that our best
estimate of aggregate asbestos reserves as of december31, 2001 made a
reasonable provision for western macarthur and all other asbestos claims.
the first phase of the trial began on march26,
2002. during the second quarter of 2002, developments in the trial caused us to
reassess our exposure based on the increased possibility of an adverse outcome
in the first phase of the litigation. among the significant developments in the
trial between april1 and may15, 2002 were evidentiary decisions by
the trial judge to exclude evidence favorable to usf&g regarding the
assignment issue and to allow into evidence unfavorable evidence regarding
other insurers policies on the aggregate limits issue, and unexpected adverse
testimony on the aggregate limits issue. these developments led us to believe
that there was an increased risk that the jury could find that usf&gs
policies did not contain aggregate limits for products hazard claims.
these developments at trial, coupled with general
changes in the legal environment affecting the potential liability of insurers
for asbestos claims, caused us to engage in more intense settlement discussions
at the end of april, in may, and early juneof 2002.
as of may15, 2002, the date on which we filed
our form10-q for the quarter ended march31, 2002, the trial and
settlement discussions were ongoing, but the parties to the settlement
discussions had been unable to reach agreement on structure, amount and other
significant terms. at that time, we were prepared to end settlement discussions
based on our continued belief that we could litigate our position and possibly
reach a more favorable outcome than a negotiated settlement would provide. in
such circumstances, we perceived the possible outcomes as ranging from minimal
amounts well within our existing asbestos reserves to unknown higher amounts
(potentially higher than the amount in the final settlement agreement,
discussed below). accordingly, we believed that we could not estimate a
reasonable range of potential loss for the western macarthur claim, and
therefore could make no disclosure of such a range. however, at the time we
filed such report on form10-q, we believed, based on various adverse
developments during the course of the first phase of the trial through may15,
that although the ultimate outcome of the western macarthur case was not
determinable at that time, it was possible that its resolution could be
material to our results of operations, and we made disclosure of this fact in
such report. we did not disclose a range of possible outcomes, as we were
unable to do so at the time of the filing.
subsequent to may15, 2002, there were additional
adverse developments at the trial. usf&gs motions for nonsuit and for
reconsideration of prior evidentiary rulings were denied. in light of continued
adverse trial developments, the fact that jury deliberations on the first phase
of the trial were expected to commence as soon as the second week of june, and
in an effort to put its largest known asbestos exposure behind us, we began
negotiating a single lump-sum payment settlement with the plaintiffs. negotiations
were intense and ultimately the company achieved a comprehensive agreement on june3,
2002, before the completion of the first phase of the jury trial. importantly,
this agreement (which was subject to bankruptcy court approval) not only
settled pending claims, it also settled, with possible minor exceptions, all
claims that western macarthur and its affiliates could possibly have against us
and usf&g, including but not limited to the claims made in the pending
lawsuit, for a pre-tax liability then estimated at $988million as
described below. the settlement agreement was filed as an exhibit to our report
on form8-k dated july23, 2002. that document includes more detailed
information about the settlement agreement.
pursuant to the provisions of the settlement
agreement, on november22, 2002, the macarthur companies filed voluntary
petitions under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code to permit the channeling of
all current and future asbestos-related claims solely to a trust to be
established pursuant to section524(g)of the bankruptcy code. consummation
of most elements of the settlement agreement was contingent upon bankruptcy
court approval of the settlement agreement as part of a broader plan for the
reorganization of the macarthur companies (the plan). in january2004,
the u.s. bankruptcy court for the northern district of california issued an
order approving the settlement agreement with the macarthur companies, and
confirming the macarthur companies proposed plan of reorganization. we are
awaiting final confirmation of the bankruptcy court order. final approval of
the plan involves substantial uncertainties that include the resolution of
various appeals from the bankruptcy courts order.
the plan of reorganization includes an injunction in
favor of the st. paul against any direct or indirect liability for
asbestos-related claims against the macarthur companies. under the injunction,
all current and future asbestos-related claims of the macarthur companies will
be channeled to, and paid solely from, the trust established by the plan. the
macarthur companies will release the usf&g parties from any and all asbestos-related
claims for personal injury, and all other claims in excess of $1 million in the
aggregate, that may be asserted relating to or arising from, directly or
indirectly, any alleged coverage provided by any of the usf&g parties to
any of the macarthur companies, including any claim for extra contractual
relief.
the st. paul has completed its funding obligations
under the 2002 settlement agreement, consisting of payments of $235 million
during the second quarter of 2002, and $747 million on january16, 2003
(including interest). following final confirmation of the bankruptcy court
ruling, the escrowed funds will
be released to the trust
established by the plan for the payment of the macarthur companies asbestos
related claims. the settlement agreement also provided for the usf&g
parties to pay $13 million (which was paid in the second quarter of 2002) and
to advance certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
settlement, bankruptcy proceedings, finalization of the plan and efforts to
achieve approval of the plan, subject to a right of reimbursement in certain
circumstances of amounts advanced. up to
$175 million of the initial $235 million payment will be paid to counsel for
the macarthur companies, and persons holding judgments against the macarthur
companies as of june3, 2002 and their counsel, and the usf&g parties
will be released from claims by such holders to the extent of $110 million paid
to such holders. at least $60 million from the initial payment and the $747
million paid in 2003 would be returned to us if final confirmation of the
bankruptcy court ruling does not occur. at december31, 2003, those
payments of $807 million were recorded in both other assets and other
liabilities.

reserves at december31, 2002 included $740 million of reserves related to

million of estimated net reinsurance recoverables and $3 million of bankruptcy
fees recoverable from others). on january16, 2003, pursuant to the terms
of the settlement agreement, we paid the remaining $740 million settlement
amount, plus interest, to the bankruptcy trustee in respect of this matter. at december31,
2003 our gross asbestos reserves included no material amount related to western
macarthur.
21 september11,
2001 terrorist attack
as of december31, 2001, our estimated gross
pretax losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a result of the
terrorist attack that occurred on september11, 2001 totaled $2.3 billion,
with an estimated net pretax operating loss of $941 million. these estimated
losses were based on a variety of actuarial techniques, coverage interpretation
and claims estimation methodologies, and included an estimate of losses
incurred but not reported, as well as estimated costs related to the settlement
of claims. our estimate of losses was
originally based on our belief that property-liability insurance losses from
the terrorist attack will total between $30 billion and $35 billion for the
insurance industry. in 2002, our estimate of ultimate losses was supplemented
by our ongoing analysis of both paid and reported claims related to the attack.
our estimate of losses remains subject to significant uncertainties and may
change over time as additional information becomes available.
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our estimated
net losses related to the terrorist attack, weighing all factors that may
impact the total net losses we will ultimately incur. based on the results of
those regular evaluations, we reallocated certain estimated losses among our
property-liability segments in 2003 and 2002. in addition, in 2003, we recorded
a $46 million reduction in estimated losses related to the attack. in 2002, we
recorded an additional loss provision of $20 million and a $33 million
reduction in our estimated provision for uncollectible reinsurance related to
the attack.
in 2002, we and other insurers obtained a summary
judgment ruling that the world trade center property loss was a single
occurrence. certain insureds, including the world trade centers leaseholder,
appealed that ruling, asking the court to determine that the property loss
constituted two separate occurrences rather than one. in september2003, the u.s circuit court of appeals for the second
circuit ruled that under terms of the policy form we used to underwrite
property coverage for the world trade center, the terrorist attack constituted
one occurrence. additionally, through separate litigation, the aviation
losses could be deemed four separate events rather than three, for purposes of
insurance and reinsurance coverage. even if the courts ultimately ruleagainst
us regarding the number of events, we believe the additional amount of
estimated after-tax losses, net of reinsurance, that we would record would not
be material to our results of operations.
the
original estimated losses in 2001 and the adjustments recorded in 2002 and 2003
impacted our statements of operations as follows. the tax expense or benefit

through december31, 2003, we paid a total of
$512 million in net losses related to the terrorist attack since it occurred,
including $205 million during the year ended december31, 2003.
the
terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 was signed into law in november2002.
this temporary legislation remains in effect until december31, 2005, and
requires insurers to offer coverage for certain types of terrorist acts in
their commercial property and liability insurance policies, and establishes a
federal program to reimburse insurers for a portion of losses so insured.
22 goodwill and other intangible assets
in 2002, we implemented the provisions of sfas no.142,
goodwill and other intangible assets, which established financial accounting
and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. the statement
changed prior accounting practice in the way intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives, including goodwill, are tested for impairment on an annual basis.
generally, it also required that those assets meeting the criteria for
classification as intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized to
expense over those lives, while intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
and goodwill are not to be amortized. we also reviewed the amortization method
and useful lives of existing intangible assets, and adjusted as appropriate. generally,
amortization was accelerated and useful lives shortened. as a result of
implementing the provisions of sfas no.142, we did not record any
goodwill amortization expense in 2003 or 2002. for the year of 2001, our goodwill
amortization expense totaled $114 million. amortization expense associated with
intangible assets totaled $31 million, $18 million and $2 million for the years
ended december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
in the second quarter of 2003, we completed our annual
evaluation of our recorded goodwill for impairment in accordance with
provisions of sfas no.142, which concluded that none of our goodwill was
impaired.
in connection with our reclassification of certain
assets previously accounted for as goodwill to other intangible assets in 2002,
we established a deferred tax liability of $6 million in the second quarter of
2002. that provision was classified as a cumulative effect of accounting change
effective as of january1, 2002.

23 statutory accounting practices
our underwriting operations are required to file
financial statements with state and foreign regulatory authorities. the
accounting principles used to prepare these statutory financial statements
follow prescribed or permitted accounting principles, which differ from gaap.
prescribed statutory accounting practices include state laws, regulations and
general administrative rulesissued by the state of domicile as well as a
variety of publications and manuals of the national association of insurance
commissioners (naic). permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all
accounting practices not so prescribed, but allowed by the state of domicile. beginning
in 2001, fire and marine was granted a permitted practice regarding the
valuation of certain investments in affiliated limited liability companies,
allowing it to value these investments at their audited gaap equity. since
these investments were not required to be valued on a statutory basis, fire and
marine is not able to determine the impact on statutory surplus.
on a statutory accounting basis, our
property-liability underwriting operations estimated net income for 2003 was
$795 million. in 2002, actual net income on a statutory accounting basis was
$550 million, and in 2001, those operations actual net loss on a statutory
accounting basis was $1.13 billion. the estimated statutory surplus
(shareholders equity) of our property-liability underwriting operations was
$5.75 billion as of december31, 2003. the actual statutory surplus as of
december31, 2002 was $5.22billion.
the naic published revised
statutory accounting practices in connection with its codification project,
which became effective january1, 2001. the cumulative effect to our
property-liability insurance operations of the adoption of these practices was
to increase statutory surplus by $126 million, primarily related to the
treatment of deferred taxes.
24 other
comprehensive income
other
comprehensive income is defined as any change in our equity from transactions
and other events originating from non-owner sources. in our case, those changes
are comprised of our reported net income, changes in unrealized appreciation of
investments, changes in the unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency
translation adjustments and derivatives, and changes in the minimum pension
liability adjustment for our unqualified pension plan. the following summaries
present the components of our other comprehensive income, other than net
income, for the last three years.

quarter 2003 pretax underwriting losses of $367 million were comprised of
profits of $182 million from ongoing business segments and losses of $549
million from segments that are being exited. runoff underwriting results
included a $350 million reserve charge in health care, current period
underwriting losses of $26 million, an increase in the allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance recoverables of $37 million, a $45 million loss
provision for incurred but not reported asbestos claims, and prior period reserve
increases in other runoff businesses.
26 impact of
accounting pronouncements to be adopted in the future
in december2002, the fasb issued sfas no.148,
accounting for stock-based compensationtransition and disclosure, which
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. this
statement requires additional disclosures in the event of a voluntary change. it
also no longer permits the use of the original prospective method of transition
for changes to the fair value based method for fiscal years beginning after december15,
2003. we currently account for stock-based compensation under apb opinion no.25,
accounting for stock issued to employees, using the intrinsic value method,
and have not made a determination regarding any change to the fair value
method.
as
discussed in more detail in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements,
in december2003, the fasb issued a revised version of fasb interpretation
no.46, consolidation of variable
interest entities (fin 46(r)), which again deferred the effective
date for certain provisions of fin 46(r) until the first interim or annual
period beginning after december15, 2003, which for us would be the period
ended march31, 2004. under the partial adoption provisions of fin 46(r),
we early-adopted the consolidation and disclosure provisions of this
interpretation in 2003. our partial adoption specifically excluded the
following item.
lloyds syndicateswe participate in
various lloyds syndicates at varying levels. we continue to evaluate the
implications of fin 46(r) with respect to these syndicates, and at this time we
are not able to quantify the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial
statements.
on january12,
2004, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued fasb staff
position no. fas 106-1, accounting and disclosure
requirements related to the medicare prescription drug, improvement and
modernization act of 2003 (fsp 106-1). this pronouncement
provides companies with the option to make a one-time election to defer
accounting for the effects of the medicare act referenced in its title (the
act). we have decided to defer accounting for the act under fsp 106-1 and have
made the required disclosures in note 13retirement
plans to the consolidated financial statements. the final accounting guidance
could require changes to previously reported information. we will monitor the
fasb deliberations and account for the act based on the pronouncement expected
to be issued.
item 9. changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and
financial disclosure.
none.
item 9a. disclosure controls and procedures.
the st. paul has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as those terms
are defined in rules13a-14(c)and 15d-14(c)under the
securities exchange act of 1934 (exchange act). jays. fishman, chairman
and chief executive officer of the st. paul, and thomas a. bradley, executive
vice president and chief financial officer of the st. paul, have evaluated our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended december31,
2003. based on their evaluations, messrs.fishman and bradley have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or
submit under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by sec rulesand forms.
there were no significant
changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect these controls after the date of their evaluations. there were no
deficiencies or material weaknesses, and therefore there were no corrective
actions taken.

item 10. directors and executive officers of the registrant.
the companys annual

there is no family
relationship between any director, executive officer, or person nominated or
chosen to become a director or executive officer, and there are no arrangements
or understandings between any of these officers and any other person pursuant
to which the officer was selected as an officer.
the companys board of
directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines and charters of the audit
committee, the compensation committee, the risk committee and the governance
committee. such corporate governance guidelines and charters are available on
the companys internet website, stpaul.com, and are also available in print to
any shareholders who request it in writing to the companys corporate secretary
at the companys principal executive offices.
the company has adopted an
employee code of conduct that applies to all employees, officers and directors
of the company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. a portion of this code
comprises the companys code of ethics
for its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions within
the meaning of paragraph (b)of item 406 of regulation s-k under the
securities exchange act of 1934. the employee code of conduct is available on
the companys internet website, stpaul.com and is also available in print to
any shareholders who request it in writing to the companys corporate secretary
at the companys principal executive offices.
the company intends to
satisfy the disclosure requirement under item 10 of form8-k under
the securities exchange act of 1934 regarding an amendment to, or a waiver
from, a provision of its employee code of conduct that applies to the companys
principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting
officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions and that relates
to any element of the code of ethics
enumerated in paragraph (b)of item 406 of regulation s-k under the
securities exchange act of 1934 by posting such information on the companys
internet website, stpaul.com.
section16(a)of
the exchange act requires executive officers and directors, and persons who
beneficially own more than 10% of the companys common stock, to file initial
reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the sec and the
new york stock exchange. executive officers, directors and beneficial owners
with more than 10% of the companys common stock are required by sec
regulations to furnish the company with copies of all section16(a)forms
they file.
based solely on the
companys review of copies of such reports and written representations from the
companys executive officers and directors, the company believes that its
executive officers and directors complied with all section16(a)filing
requirements during 2003, except as follows:
on february3, 2003, messrs.bessette,

grants through the companys 1994 stock incentive plan of 6,000 shares each. the
form4s reporting these transactions were filed with the sec on november13,
2003.
item 11. executive compensation.
board
of directors compensation
the value of the director compensation program and the
importance and appropriateness of each of its components are reviewed annually
by the governance committee, which considers, among other things, the results
of independent surveys and director compensation programs of peer companies.
the objectives of the program are to establish and maintain a program designed
to closely align the interests of directors with shareholders and to attract
and retain highly qualified directors with total pay opportunity ranking at
least in the second
quartile of comparable companies. the governance committee reports to the board
of directors, which considers and approves the program.
the board of directors has established a target for
ownership of the companys common stock for outside directors at a value of
five times the directors annual retainer (currently $22,500 per year). each
new director will be asked to meet or exceed that target within five years of
election to the board. the board has also adopted a policy that the company not
hire a director or a directors firm to provide professional or financial services,
except with the consent of the board governance committee.
under the companys current director compensation
program, outside directors are entitled to compensation comprised of a $22,500
annual retainer, a $1,000 meeting fee in respect of each board and committee
meeting attended, an annual stock option award of 6,000 shares of company
common stock, and participation in the directors charitable award program and
the deferred stock plan for non-employee directors (the deferred stock plan).
also, outside directors who chair a committee receive an annual fee of $4,000.
the components of the compensation program are described in the following
paragraphs.
annual
retainer, meeting fees and committee chair fees. directors may elect to have all or
any portion of their annual retainer, their meeting fees, and any committee
chair fees paid in cash or deferred through the directors deferred
compensation plan and invested in a phantom company common stock fund and/or
nine phantom investment funds. although no shares of the companys common stock
are purchased for or held in the phantom company stock fund, any director who
elects to have any of his or her fees directed into that fund will be deemed to
have purchased shares on the date the fees would otherwise have been paid in
cash. the value of that fund rises or falls as the price of company common
stock fluctuates in the market. also, dividends on those phantom shares are reinvested
in additional phantom shares. cash distributions are made from the phantom
company stock fund and from the other investment funds on pre-designated dates,
usually following termination of service as a director, at the closing price of
the common stock and the investment funds on the date of distribution. currently,
ten outside directors have deferred at least a portion of their fees into the
directors deferred compensation plan, and seven of those directors have all or
a portion of their plan interest invested in the phantom company common stock
fund.
stock
options. under
the companys amended and restated 1994 stock incentive plan (stock incentive
plan), annual non-qualified stock option grants covering 6,000 common shares
are made to each outside director at the regular meeting of the board following
the end of the companys third quarter. such options are granted at the market
price of the companys common stock on the date of grant and become exercisable
in 25% increments on the first four anniversaries of the date of grant. under
that plan, options terminate at the earliest of 10years after the date of
grant, immediately if directorship is terminated for cause, 90days after
any voluntary termination of service as a director other than by retirement
(but the option in this case may be exercised only to the extent it was
exercisable on the date of such termination), or any earlier time set by the compensation
committee at the time of option grant. a directors retirement will not
accelerate the termination of options granted after 1998. options granted under
the stock incentive plan prior to 1999 will terminate three years after
retirement or earlier under certain circumstances. special provisions apply in
the case of death of an optionee or in the case of a change of control, as
defined below. if an option was not fully exercisable at the time of occurrence
of a change of control, all portions of the option immediately would become
exercisable in full.
change of control is defined in the stock incentive
plan to mean a change of control of the company of a nature that would be
required to be reported to the securities and exchange commission on form8-k
pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 (exchange act), with such
change of control to be deemed to have occurred when (a)any person, as
defined in the exchange act, other than the company or a company subsidiary or
one of their employee benefit plans, is or becomes the beneficial
owner of 50percent
or more of the companys common stock or (b)members of the board of
directors on may3, 1994 (the incumbent board) cease to constitute a
majority thereof (provided that persons subsequently becoming directors with
the approval of directors comprising at least three-quarters of the
incumbent board shall be considered as members of the incumbent board). all
current directors are considered members of the incumbent board. the
consummation of the proposed merger would constitute a change in control for
these purposes, and director options will immediately vest at that time.
director
tenure program. a
board policy provides that each director with 15 or more years of service and
each director who will be at least 70years old on or before the date of
the next shareholders meeting shall tender his or her resignation to the chair
of the governance committee by november20 of each year indicating his or
her intent not to stand for re-election at the subsequent annual meeting of the
shareholders. additionally, upon a substantial change in principal employment,
a director should tender his or her resignation. if, however, upon review, the
governance committee determines that there is a continuing need on the board of
directors for the type of qualifications the resigning director provides, then
such director may be asked to become a candidate for re-election.
deferred
stock plan. the
deferred stock plan is intended to further align the non-employee directors
interests with those of the shareholders of the company. under the deferred
stock plan, participating non-employee directors receive, in an account in the
directors name, an annual credit of $25,000 which is deemed invested, on the
business day immediately following the annual meeting of shareholders, in the
companys common stock based on the closing price of common stock on the date
credited. dividends on the accumulated shares are deemed reinvested in
additional shares. the deferred stock plan provides that upon a directors
cessation of service for any reason, the accumulated shares in that directors
account will be distributed in the form of shares of the companys common
stock, all at once or in installments, depending upon the participating
directors election.
directors
charitable award program. as part of the companys policy of providing support
for charitable institutions and in order to retain and attract qualified
directors, the board of directors established the directors charitable award
program, which is funded by life insurance on the lives of the members of the
board of directors. the company intends to make charitable contributions of
$1million per director, paid out over a period of 10years following
the death of the director. each director is able to recommend up to four
charities to receive contributions from the company. directors become vested in
this program in $200,000 annual increments starting with their first
anniversary of election as a director. directors are fully vested upon the
earliest of the fifth anniversary of their election as a director, death,
disability, or retirement at or after age 70 or upon a change of control
(generally defined in the same manner as in the stock incentive plan described
above). the consummation of the proposed merger would constitute a change of
control for these purposes. beneficiary organizations designated under this
program must be tax-exempt, and donations ultimately paid by the company should
be deductible against federal and other income taxes payable by the company in
accordance with the tax laws applicable at the time. directors derive no
financial benefit from the program, since all insurance proceeds and charitable
deductions accrue solely to the company.
grantor
trust. the
company has transferred funds to a grantor trust created for the purpose of
implementing benefits under various non-qualified plans of deferred
compensation, including the directors deferred compensation plan and the
directors retirement plan (the implemented plans). following a change of
control no portion of the trust assets may be returned to the company or any
subsidiary unless the trustee determines that such portion of the assets and
future earnings on it never will be required to pay benefits and if a majority
of the participants of the implemented plans consent to the return of the
assets. the consummation of the proposed merger would not constitute a change
of control for these purposes. unlike assets held in the trusts created to
implement benefits under the companys tax-qualified plans, assets held in the
grantor trust remain subject to the claims of the companys creditors.
if the company
becomes insolvent, the trustee will be required to cease payment of benefits
under all implemented plans and dispose of trust assets pursuant to the
direction of a court of competent jurisdiction.

compensation
the following table sets
forth the cash and non-cash compensation for each of the last three fiscal
years awarded to or earned by the chief executive officer of the company, mr.fishman,

chief investment officer
(1) the amounts shown were earned in the year
indicated and paid under the bonus program in the following year. because of
the companys financial losses resulting from the tragedy of september11,
2001 and from other events and actions in 2001, management urged the
compensation committee to refrain from paying bonuses to any executive officers
for 2001. pursuant to his recruitment and hiring arrangement, mr.fishman
was guaranteed a payment of $227,397 in february2002. however,
considering the events of september11, 2001 and other 2001 losses, he
volunteered to forego receipt of that payment. in lieu thereof, 12,245 stock
options having a black-scholes value equal to that guaranteed payment
were awarded to mr.fishman. mr.heyman, who joined the company in may2002,
was paid $500,000 for 2002 in february2003 pursuant to the terms of his
employment agreement.
(2) included in mr.fishmans other annual
compensation in 2003 is $326,637 representing certain travel expenses and

policy. included in mr.heymans 2003 other annual compensation is

remains employed as the chief executive officer by the company or the combined
company (if the proposed merger is completed), and he becomes the chairman of the
board of directors of the combined company on january1, 2006, he would
not intend to exercise any of the options that will vest in connection with the
consummation of the proposed merger until after they would have been
exercisable in accordance with their terms and vesting schedules in effect on november16,
2003.
(2) the options granted on february4,
2003 were valued at the grant date using the black-scholes option-pricing

yield 2.88%; risk-free rate of return of 3.72%; and the maximum exercise period
at the time of grant which was 10years.

pension
all of the named executives participate in the companys
pension plans. the amount of their remuneration which is covered by a qualified
plan for 2003 is the amount set forth in the salary, bonus and restricted stock
award (granted pursuant to the capital accumulation plan) columns of the
summary compensation table up to the qualified plan compensation limit. any
remuneration exceeding that limit is covered under the companys nonqualified
pension plan.
effective january1, 2001, the pension plan was
amended to provide a cash balance benefit formula. this formula applies to all
employees hired on or after january1, 2001. employees hired prior to january1,
2001, were given a choice in the year 2000 of remaining under the prior defined
benefit formula (the traditional formula) or converting to the cash balance
formula. both messrs.fishman and heyman were hired after january1,
2001, and will have their benefits determined under the cash balance formula.
messrs.miller and bradley and ms.zuraitis elected to have their
benefit calculated under the cash balance formula. as a result, none of the
named executives have their benefits determined under the traditional formula. retirement
benefits for messrs.miller and bradley and ms.zuraitis are fully
vested.
the cash balance benefit is expressed in the form of a
hypothetical account balance. for periods between january1, 2001 and december31,
2002, benefit credits accrued annually at a rate between 6% and 10%. for
periods after january1, 2003, benefit credits will accrue annually at a
rate between 3% and 5%. a participants individual rate will increase with age
and service. interest credits are applied quarterly to the prior quarters
balance; these interest credits are based on the yield on 10-year treasury
bonds. although the normal form of benefit is an annuity, the hypothetical
account balance is also payable as a single lump sum.
the
estimated annual benefit provided in total by the cash balance formula
described above, expressed in the form of a single life annuity, is as follows:

these estimates are
based on the following assumptions:
the
benefit is determined as of age 65 and assumes employment until such age.
pay
is assumed to remain at 2003 levels, while bonuses are assumed to be 100% of
base pay.
the
average interest-crediting rate for the cash balance plan for 2003
(3.91%) remains constant.
the
interest rate used to convert hypothetical account balances to annual annuities
in 2003 (4.76%) remains constant.
the mortality table used to
convert hypothetical account balances to annual annuities in 2003 (table
prescribed in revenue ruling 2001-62) is used.
amended and
restated special (change of control) severance policy
under the companys amended and restated special
severance policy (policy), severance benefits would be provided to eligible
employees of the company, including all of the named executives, in the event
their employment terminates under certain conditions within two years following
a change of control (as defined in the policy). if the employment of any named
executive is terminated within two years after a change of control by the
employer other than for cause, or by the employee for good reason, or if the
employment of the named executive terminates for any reason during the 30-day
period commencing on the anniversary of the change of control, the named
executive would become entitled to certain benefits. the consummation of the
proposed merger would constitute a change of control under this policy.
under the policy, for named
executives, the term cause is generally defined as willfully engaging in
illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is demonstrably and materially
injurious to the company or its affiliates or willful and continued failure to
perform substantially his or her duties after a written demand is delivered by
the companys board of directors. good
reason is defined to include such situations as a change in duties or
responsibilities that is inconsistent in any materially adverse respect with
the named executives positions, duties, responsibilities or status prior to
the change of control, a materially adverse change in the named executives
titles and offices (including, if applicable, membership on the board of
directors) as in effect immediately prior to the change of control, a reduction
in the named executives rate of base salary or annual target bonus
opportunity, job relocations of a certain type and failure to maintain benefits
that are substantially the same as are in effect when the change of control
occurs.
the following is a
summary of the severance benefits provided to named executives under the
policy:
1. a named
executive will receive a lump-sum severance payment equal to three times the
sum of (i)the highest annual base salary rate payable to the named
executive during the 12-month period immediately prior to termination and (ii)the
named executives target bonus for the year of termination.
2. participation
will be continued for three years in those medical, dental, disability and life
insurance programs in which the named executive participated on the date
employment terminated.
3. outplacement
assistance will be provided which is no less favorable than under the terms of
the outplacement assistance plan applicable to the named executive at the time
of the change of control, unless the named executive elects to receive a lump
cash payment in lieu thereof.
4. if the
payments to the named executives would be subject to the excise tax on excess
parachute payments imposed by section4999 of the code, the company will
reimburse the named executive for the amount of such excise tax (and the income
and excise taxes on such reimbursement), subject to certain limitations.
the policy is subject to
amendment or termination at any time prior to a change of control unless the
amendment or termination is approved within 12months of the change of
control and would adversely affect the rights (or potential rights) of the
named executive. after a change of control, no amendment or termination of the
policy may adversely affect the rights (or potential rights) of the named
executive with respect to such a change of control.

acquire beneficial ownership of the following number of shares within 60
calendar days: messrs.fishman, bradley, heyman, miller, and ms.zuraitis
each respectively 906,123, 188,487, 75,000, 230,910, and 196,520; messrs.dasburg,
duberstein, graev, hodgson, kling, lawrence, maccoll, nelson, sprenger and ms.byrd
and ms.dolan, each respectively 30,000, 22,692, 1,500, 24,000, 30,000, 0,
466,339, 30,000, 28,000, 4,500, and 4,500; and all directors and executive
officers as a group 3,010,603. these shares are included in the totals shown

under
the companys directors deferred compensation plan, participating non-employee
directors are eligible to defer directors fees to, among others, a company
common stock equivalent account. directors electing common stock equivalents
have their deferred accounts credited with the number
of common shares of the
company which could have been purchased with the fees on the date they were
deferred. this is a phantom arrangement, and no common shares are actually purchased
or held for any directors account. however, dividends on phantom shares are
credited to participating directors accounts, and the value of a participating
directors common stock account fluctuates with changes in the market value of
the companys common stock. the following directors had the following number of
phantom shares of common stock allocated to their deferred compensation
accounts: ms.byrd 1,155; mr.dasburg 4,724; mr.duberstein

annual credit of $25,000 that is deemed invested, on the business day
immediately following the annual meeting of shareholders, in the companys
common stock based on the closing price of common stock on the date credited.
in addition, all current non-employee directors serving on february5,
2001 elected to transfer the value of their benefits under the directors
retirement plan to the deferred stock plan, effective may1, 2001.
dividends on the accumulated shares are deemed reinvested in additional shares.
this is a phantom arrangement, and no common shares are actually held for any
directors account. upon a directors cessation of service, the accumulated
shares in that directors account will be distributed in the form of shares of
the companys common stock. the following directors had the following number of
phantom shares of common stock allocated to their deferred stock plan accounts:
mr.dasburg 25,052 shares; ms.dolan 1,903 shares; mr.duberstein
12,104 shares; mr.graev 1,299 shares; mr.hodgson 14,621 shares; mr.kling

all executive officers as a group 3,190 shares. each share of seriesb
preferred stock is convertible into and votes as if it were eight shares of the
companys common stock. these shares, as if converted to common stock, are
included in the totals shown for each executive officer and for all executive
officers as a group. employees (including executive officers) have sole voting
power and no investment power over shares allocated to their preferred stock

consists of fees for sarbanes-oxley act documentation assistance, consultation

filings, consultation on proposed transactions and audit work on benefit plans
and funds, and other attestation and certification services. in 2002, consists
primarily of fees for accounting consultation and audit work in connection with
the platinum underwriters holdings,ltd. transaction and also includes
fees for review of regulatory filings, work on proposed transactions and audit
work on benefit plans and funds, and other attestation and certification

(3) both years include fees
related to domestic and international tax planning, tax return preparation and

(4) the audit committee of
the board of directors considered whether providing the non-audit services
shown in this table is compatible with maintaining kpmgs independence.
the charter of the audit committee of the board of
directors provides that the committee is responsible for pre-approving, or
adopting appropriate procedures to pre-approve, all audit services and
permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed
for the company by its independent auditor. the committee has delegated the
authority to grant such pre-approvals to the committee chair, which approvals
are then reviewed by the full committee at its next regular meeting. typically,
however, the committee itself reviews the matters to be approved. the
procedures for pre-approving all audit and non-audit services provided by the
independent auditor include the committee reviewing, on a quarterly basis, a
list of the specific categories of audit and audit-related services, tax
services and other services that the independent auditor may provide and
approving the provision of the described services by the independent auditor
within specified dollar limits. committee approval would be required to exceed
the specified dollar limit for a particular category of services or to engage
the independent auditor for any services not included in the pre-approved list
of services. the committee periodically monitors the services rendered by and
actual fees paid to the independent auditor to ensure that such services are
within the parameters approved by the committee.

2003. these consolidated financial statements and our report thereon are
included in the annual report on form10-k for the year ended december31,
2003. in connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated
financial statements we also have audited the related financial statement schedules

these financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the companys

statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the
company adopted the provisions of the statement of financial accounting
standards no.133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities and, as also described in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements, in 2002 the company adopted the provisions of the statement of
financial accounting standards no.141, business combinations and the
statement of financial accounting standards no.142, goodwill and other intangible
