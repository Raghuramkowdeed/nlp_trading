ON NOVEMBER 17, 2003,

THE ST. PAUL AND TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TRAVELERS) ANNOUNCED THE

SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT THAT WILL CREATE THE ST. PAUL

TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (ST. PAUL TRAVELERS), WHICH WOULD BE THE

NARRATIVE

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURANCE

OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURANCE OPERATIONS UNDERWRITE INSURANCE AND PROVIDE INSURANCE-RELATED

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE

UNITED STATES AND IN SELECTED INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. OUR LARGEST INSURANCE

UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY IS ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE

3

INSURANCE

COMPANY (FIRE AND MARINE). THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF PROPERTY-LIABILITY REVENUES

ARE PREMIUMS EARNED FROM INSURANCE POLICIES, INCOME EARNED FROM THE INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND NET REALIZED GAINS FROM SALES OF INVESTMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE MOST

RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS PUBLISHED IN BESTS REVIEW WITH RESPECT TO

COMMERCIAL LINES PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURERS DOING BUSINESS IN THE UNITED

STATES, OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS RANKED AS THE

SIXTH-LARGEST ON THE BASIS OF 2002 DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUMS.

PRINCIPAL DEPARTMENTS AND PRODUCTS

IN

GENERAL, OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OPERATIONS UNDERWRITE THE FOLLOWING

TYPES, OR LINES, OF INSURANCE COVERAGES.

·

GENERAL LIABILITY, WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR

LIABILITY EXPOSURES INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE ARISING FROM

GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, PRODUCTS SOLD AND COMPLETED WORK;

·

LIABILITY

COVERAGES FOR CORPORATIONS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THEIR

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, AND FOR A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS LAWYERS,

INSURANCE AGENTS AND REAL ESTATE AGENTS;

·

PROPERTY

INSURANCE, WHICH INSURES TANGIBLE PROPERTY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR LOSS OF USE;

·

COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL, WHICH PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY COVERAGE (FOR DAMAGES

SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY FIRE, WIND, HAIL, WATER, THEFT, AND VANDALISM) AND

LIABILITY COVERAGE (FOR THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY FROM ACCIDENTS OCCURRING ON THE

INSUREDS PREMISES OR ARISING OUT OF THEIR OPERATIONS);

·

COMMERCIAL

AUTO, WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR BUSINESSES AGAINST LOSSES RESULTING FROM

THEIR OWNERSHIP, MAINTENANCE OR USE OF AUTOMOBILES AND TRUCKS, INCLUDING LOSSES

RESULTING FROM BODILY INJURY TO THIRD PARTIES, PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO AN INSUREDS

VEHICLE AND PROPERTY DAMAGE TO OTHER VEHICLES AND OTHER PROPERTY;

·

WORKERS

COMPENSATION, WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYERS FOR SPECIFIED BENEFITS

PAYABLE UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW FOR WORKPLACE INJURIES, DISABILITIES OR

DEATH TO EMPLOYEES, WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT;

·

INLAND

MARINE, WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR PROPERTY WHICH IS GENERALLY MOBILE IN

NATURE, SUCH AS CONTRACTORS EQUIPMENT OR CARGO BEING SHIPPED BY TRUCK OR RAIL,

AS WELL AS INSTRUMENTALITIES OF TRANSPORTATION OR COMMUNICATION SUCH AS

BRIDGES, TUNNELS AND COMPUTERS, AND CERTAIN PROPERTY RISKS SUCH AS BUILDERS

RISK;

·

AVIATION

AND OCEAN MARINE INSURANCE;

·

CONTRACT

SURETY BONDS AND COMMERCIAL SURETY BONDS; AND

·

UMBRELLA

COVERAGES, WHICH PROVIDE SPECIFIED LAYERS OF COVERAGE ON ACCOUNTS WHERE WE DO

NOT PROVIDE THE PRIMARY LIABILITY COVERAGE.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

THESE LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING TYPES OF COVERAGE THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO AN

OPERATING SEGMENT, ARE INCLUDED IN THE SEGMENT DESCRIPTIONS THAT FOLLOW THIS

SECTION.

THROUGH ONE OR MORE LINES

UNDERWRITTEN BY OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS, INCLUDING PROPERTY AND GENERAL

LIABILITY, WE ARE EXPOSED TO LOSSES FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND MOLD CLAIMS. ENVIRONMENTAL

CLAIMS INCLUDE CLAIMS OF LIABILITY FOR ALLEGED DAMAGE FROM HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC

MATERIALS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES INCLUDE AN ABSOLUTE

POLLUTION EXCLUSION; HOWEVER, IN SEVERAL BUSINESS CENTERS, PARTICULARLY

OIL AND GAS

AND

UMBRELLA/EXCESS & SURPLUS LINES

IN OUR SPECIALTY

COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, WE CONTINUE TO UNDERWRITE NEW BUSINESS WITH LIMITED

POLLUTION COVERAGE. IN ADDITION, MOST BUSINESS THAT WE UNDERWRITE IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM AND IRELAND DO NOT NORMALLY INCLUDE ABSOLUTE POLLUTION EXCLUSIONS. UNDER

CERTAIN POLICIES WE UNDERWRITE, WE ARE EXPOSED TO LOSSES FROM CLAIMS OF MOLD

AND MOISTURE INFILTRATION, WHICH CAN CAUSE PERSONAL INJURY AND DAMAGE TO

PROPERTY. CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS HAVE SUBMITTED CLAIMS TO US UNDER THEIR

PROPERTY AND GENERAL LIABILITY POLICES THAT INCLUDE DAMAGES RELATED TO THE

PRESENCE

4

OF MOLD.

PREDOMINANTLY, THESE MOLD CLAIMS ARE FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE SUBMITTED UNDER A

FIRST-PARTY PROPERTY POLICY, OR FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY

SUBMITTED UNDER A GENERAL LIABILITY POLICY. FEW PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS RELATED

TO MOLD UNDER WORKERS COMPENSATION OR GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES HAVE BEEN

SUBMITTED TO US. THE CAUSE AND TYPE OF DAMAGE OF EACH PROPERTY DAMAGE OR BODILY

INJURY INCIDENT INVOLVING MOLD DETERMINES WHETHER THE CLAIM MAY BE A COVERED

LOSS UNDER A PROPERTY POLICY OR IF THERE IS A DUTY TO DEFEND AND/OR INDEMNIFY

AN INSURED IN A THIRD-PARTY CLAIM. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO CLAIMS

ARISING FROM THE USE OF ASBESTOS IN BUILDING MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION. THE ENVIRONMENTAL

AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS INCLUDED

IN THIS REPORT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR HISTORICAL

EXPOSURE TO AND LOSSES FROM ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS

IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, WE REVISED OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE BUSINESS

SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE TO REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE BUSINESSES ARE

MANAGED. OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS CONSIST OF TWO SEGMENTS

CONSTITUTING OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS (

SPECIALTY

COMMERCIAL

AND

COMMERCIAL LINES

),

AND ONE SEGMENT PREDOMINANTLY COMPRISED OF OUR RUNOFF OPERATIONS

(OTHER)

. THE COMPOSITION OF THOSE

RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS IS DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION.

THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF CHANGES MADE TO OUR SEGMENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2003.

·

OUR

SURETY & CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TOGETHER AS A

SEPARATE SPECIALTY SEGMENT, ARE NOW SEPARATE COMPONENTS OF OUR

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

SEGMENT.

·

OUR

ONGOING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS,

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TOGETHER AS A SEPARATE SPECIALTY SEGMENT, ARE NOW SEPARATE

COMPONENTS OF OUR

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

SEGMENT.

·

OUR

HEALTH CARE, REINSURANCE AND OTHER OPERATIONS, EACH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS A

SEPARATE RUNOFF BUSINESS SEGMENT, HAVE BEEN COMBINED INTO A SINGLE

OTHER

RUNOFF SEGMENT AND ARE UNDER COMMON

MANAGEMENT. RUNOFF MEANS THAT WE HAVE CEASED OR PLAN TO CEASE UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

·

THE

RESULTS OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS, AS WELL AS LOSS

DEVELOPMENT ON BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN PRIOR TO 1980 (PRIOR TO 1988 FOR BUSINESS

ACQUIRED IN OUR MERGER WITH USF&G CORPORATION IN 1998), PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED

IN OUR

COMMERCIAL LINES

SEGMENT,

ARE NOW INCLUDED IN THE

OTHER

SEGMENT.

IN ADDITION TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS, THIS PRIOR YEAR

BUSINESS INCLUDES THE MAJORITY OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS LIABILITY

EXPOSURES. THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE EXPOSURES IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SAME

MANAGEMENT TEAM RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE

OTHER

SEGMENT.

IN ADDITION, IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2003, OUR

SPECIALTY PROGRAMS

BUSINESS CENTER, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN OUR SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, WAS

MOVED TO OUR COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE MANNER IN

WHICH THIS BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN AND MANAGED. ALL DATA FOR 2002 AND 2001 IN

THIS REPORT WERE RESTATED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES MADE TO OUR SEGMENT

REPORTING STRUCTURE IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2003. THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION DESCRIBES THE COMPOSITION OF OUR THREE PROPERTY-LIABILITY

UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS.

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL.

THIS SEGMENT

INCLUDES BUSINESS CENTERS THAT WE HAVE DESIGNATED SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

OPERATIONS BECAUSE EACH PROVIDES DEDICATED UNDERWRITING, CLAIM AND RISK CONTROL

SERVICES THAT REQUIRE SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE, AND EACH FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON

THE RESPECTIVE CUSTOMERS IT SERVES. INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THESE BUSINESS

CENTERS IS OFTEN PROVIDED ON PROPRIETARY INSURANCE FORMS. THIS SEGMENT ALSO

INCLUDES OUR ONGOING SPECIALTY INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND OUR ONGOING

OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS. THE SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT COLLECTIVELY GENERATED

$4.50 BILLION OF NET EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2003 (ACCOUNTING FOR 64% OF OUR

CONSOLIDATED EARNED PREMIUM VOLUME). THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION DESCRIBES THE

OPERATIONS THAT COMPRISE OUR SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT.

5

THE

SURETY

BUSINESS CENTER UNDERWRITES SURETY

BONDS, WHICH ARE AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH ONE PARTY (THE SURETY) GUARANTEES TO

ANOTHER PARTY (THE OWNER OR OBLIGEE) THAT A THIRD PARTY (THE CONTRACTOR OR

PRINCIPAL) WILL PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL OR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. THE

SURETY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVALUATING THE RISK TO BE COVERED AND FOR DETERMINING

IF THE PRINCIPAL MEETS THE UNDERWRITING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BOND. THE PREMIUM

CHARGED WILL REFLECT THE SIZE AND TYPE OF THE OBLIGATION. BY OFFERING A BOND,

THE SURETY IS OFFERING ASSURANCE THAT ITS CUSTOMER WILL MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS AS

SPECIFIED UNDER THE BOND.

ACCORDING TO DATA

PUBLISHED BY THE SURETY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, OUR DOMESTIC SURETY OPERATIONS

WERE THE SECOND-LARGEST IN THE UNITED STATES BASED ON 2002 DIRECT PREMIUMS

WRITTEN. IN ADDITION TO ITS U.S. OPERATIONS, OUR SURETY BUSINESS CENTER ALSO

INCLUDES AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES, THE LEADING SURETY UNDERWRITER IN MEXICO, AND

OUR CANADIAN OPERATIONS, ST. PAUL GUARANTEE, THE LARGEST SURETY BOND

UNDERWRITER IN CANADA.

FOR

CONTRACT SURETY

, WE PROVIDE BID,

PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS TO A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CLIENTS SPECIALIZING IN

GENERAL CONTRACTING, HIGHWAY AND BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION, ASPHALT PAVING,

UNDERGROUND AND PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION, MANUFACTURING, CIVIL AND HEAVY ENGINEERING,

AND MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION. BID BONDS PROVIDE FINANCIAL

ASSURANCE THAT BIDS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED IN GOOD FAITH AND THAT THE CONTRACTOR

INTENDS TO ENTER INTO THE CONTRACT AT THE PRICE BID AND PROVIDE THE REQUIRED

PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS. PERFORMANCE BONDS REQUIRE US TO FULFILL THE

CONTRACTORS OBLIGATIONS TO THE OBLIGEE SHOULD THE CONTRACTOR FAIL TO PERFORM

UNDER THE CONTRACT. PAYMENT BONDS GUARANTEE THAT THE CONTRACTOR WILL PAY

CERTAIN SUBCONTRACTOR, LABOR AND MATERIAL BILLS ASSOCIATED WITH A PROJECT.

FOR

COMMERCIAL SURETY

, WHICH COMPRISES BONDS

COVERING OBLIGATIONS OFTEN REQUIRED BY LAW, THE BONDS THAT WE CURRENTLY

UNDERWRITE ARE AS FOLLOWS.

·

LICENSE

AND PERMIT BONDS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTES OR REGULATIONS FOR A NUMBER OF

PURPOSES, INCLUDING GUARANTEEING THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN TAXES AND FEES AND

PROVIDING CONSUMER PROTECTION AS A CONDITION TO GRANTING LICENSES RELATED TO

SELLING REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING TAX AND CUSTOMS BONDS;

·

RECLAMATION

BONDS, WHICH COVER RECLAMATION COSTS FOR MINING AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES;

·

FIDUCIARY

BONDS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTES, COURTS OR CONTRACTS FOR THE PROTECTION

OF THOSE ON WHOSE BEHALF A FIDUCIARY (SUCH AS AN EXECUTOR OF AN ESTATE OR A

GUARDIAN OF A MINOR) ACTS, INCLUDING PROBATE BONDS AND DEPOSITORY BONDS;

·

COURT

BONDS, WHICH ARE BONDS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED OF EITHER A PLAINTIFF OR A

DEFENDANT IN A LAWSUIT;

·

PUBLIC

OFFICIAL BONDS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTES AND REGULATIONS TO GUARANTEE THE

LAWFUL AND FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES OF OFFICE BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS;

·

INDEMNITY

BONDS, WHICH ARE OBLIGATIONS TO HOLD A THIRD PARTY HARMLESS OF DAMAGES RELATED

TO AN UNDERLYING OBLIGATION TO PERFORM, MAINTAIN OR PAY;

·

WORKERS

COMPENSATION SELF-INSURER BONDS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTES AND REGULATIONS

TO GUARANTEE THE PAYMENT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS TO INJURED WORKERS

OF COMPANIES THAT WISH TO SELF-INSURE THOSE OBLIGATIONS;

·

TRANSFER

AGENT INDEMNITY BONDS, WHICH PROTECT THE ISSUER OF SECURITIES AND THE TRANSFER

AGENT AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOST SHARE CERTIFICATE MAY BE PRESENTED

LATER BY AN INNOCENT PURCHASER FOR VALUE; AND

·

OTHER

MISCELLANEOUS BONDS.

LIKE CONTRACT SURETY

BONDS, COMMERCIAL SURETY BONDS EXPOSE US TO THE RISK THAT THE PRINCIPAL (E.G.,

THE FIDUCIARY IN A FIDUCIARY BOND OR THE MINING COMPANY IN A RECLAMATION BOND)

WILL NOT PERFORM THE DUTIES REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT, APPLICABLE LAW OR

REGULATION. ACCORDINGLY, WE UNDERWRITE AND PRICE THESE PRODUCTS BY ANALYZING,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PRINCIPALS CREDITWORTHINESS AND ABILITY TO PERFORM.

6

CERTAIN SECTORS OF OUR

COMMERCIAL SURETY BUSINESS TEND TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY LOW FREQUENCY BUT

POTENTIALLY HIGH SEVERITY LOSSES. IN OCTOBER 2000, WE MADE A STRATEGIC

DECISION TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE EXPOSURES IN THESE SECTORS. SINCE THAT

TIME, WE HAD REDUCED OUR TOTAL COMMERCIAL SURETY GROSS OPEN BOND EXPOSURE BY

OVER 56% BY DECEMBER 31, 2003.

WITHIN THESE SECTORS OF

OUR COMMERCIAL SURETY BUSINESS, WE HAVE EXPOSURES RELATED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF

ACCOUNTS, WHICH ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION,

CERTAIN OTHER ACCOUNTS HAVE EXPERIENCED DETERIORATION IN CREDITWORTHINESS SINCE

WE ISSUED BONDS TO THEM. GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND ITS IMPACT ON

THESE COMPANIES, WE MAY EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN CLAIMS AND, POSSIBLY, INCUR

HIGH SEVERITY LOSSES. SUCH LOSSES WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH

THE CLAIMS ARE FILED AND DETERMINED TO BE A VALID LOSS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF

THE SURETY BOND ISSUED.

WE CONTINUE TO EXIT THE

SEGMENTS OF THE COMMERCIAL SURETY MARKET THAT ARE CHARACTERIZED BY LOW

FREQUENCY BUT POTENTIALLY HIGH SEVERITY BONDS BY CEASING TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS

AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, TERMINATING THE OUTSTANDING BONDS. WE CONTINUE TO BE A

MARKET FOR TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL SURETY BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES LOW-LIMIT

BUSINESS SUCH AS LICENSE AND PERMIT, PROBATE, PUBLIC OFFICIAL, AND CUSTOMS

BONDS.

OUR

CONSTRUCTION

BUSINESS CENTER OFFERS A

VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL INSURANCE, CONSISTING

OF WORKERS COMPENSATION, GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL AUTO COVERAGES, AND

OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, TO A BROAD RANGE OF CONTRACTORS AND PARTIES

RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.

FINANCIAL &

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

PROVIDES PROPERTY

AND LIABILITY COVERAGES FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND

MANAGEMENT LIABILITY COVERAGES FOR CORPORATIONS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

AGAINST LOSSES CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OR MISCONDUCT OF NAMED DIRECTORS AND

OFFICERS, AND ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COVERAGES FOR A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONALS

SUCH AS LAWYERS, INSURANCE AGENTS AND REAL ESTATE AGENTS FOR LIABILITY FROM

ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COMMITTED IN THE COURSE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT OR

PRACTICE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT OBSERVED ANY NOTABLE INCREASE IN DIRECTORS AND

OFFICERS CLAIMS IN THIS BUSINESS CENTER, IN VIEW OF RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF

CORPORATE MALFEASANCE AND PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT, AND THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT

OF 2002 (AND REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

PURSUANT TO THAT LAW), THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF SUCH CLAIMS COULD

INCREASE.

TECHNOLOGY

OFFERS

A PORTFOLIO OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO COMPANIES INVOLVED IN

TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HEALTH SCIENCES AND ELECTRONICS

MANUFACTURING.  THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE

PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, UMBRELLA,

INTERNET LIABILITY, AND TECHNOLOGY ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COVERAGES. THE SERVICES

PROVIDED BY THIS BUSINESS CENTER INCLUDE DEDICATED UNDERWRITING, RISK CONTROL

AND SPECIALIZED CLAIM HANDLING.

THE

UMBRELLA/EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES GROUP

CONSISTS

OF TWO DISTINCT BUSINESS UNITS.

SPECIALTY

EXCESS AND UMBRELLA

FOCUSES ON UMBRELLA AND EXCESS LIABILITY

BUSINESS FOR RETAIL AGENTS AND BROKERS, WHERE OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

PROVIDING THE PRIMARY COVERAGE. THE COVERAGES UNDERWRITTEN ARE TYPICALLY

COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY AND PRODUCT LIABILITY. UMBRELLA COVERAGE MAY

ALSO BE UNDERWRITTEN OVER A COMPANY THAT RETAINS RISK OR HAS A SELF-INSURED

RETENTION, INSTEAD OF A SCHEDULED UNDERLYING POLICY. THE

EXCESS & SURPLUS LINES

UNIT

UNDERWRITES NON-ADMITTED INDIVIDUAL RISK BUSINESS FOR ESTABLISHED WHOLESALE

DISTRIBUTORS. THE COVERAGES TYPICALLY UNDERWRITTEN INCLUDE COMMERCIAL AUTO,

GENERAL LIABILITY AND PRODUCT LIABILITY.

THE

E&S UNDERWRITING FACILITIES

BUSINESS

CENTER UNDERWRITES LIABILITY AND PROPERTY FACILITIES

PRODUCED BY WHOLESALERS AND MANAGING GENERAL AGENTS, WHICH ARE LICENSED

INSURANCE AGENTS THAT MANAGE ALL OR PART OF AN INSURERS CUSTOMERS WITH UNIQUE

REQUIREMENTSPRIMARILY THOSE WITH MODERATE TO HIGH HAZARD EXPOSURES REQUIRING

EXPERTISE IN THE SURPLUS LINES MARKETPLACE AND THE ABILITY TO USE POLICY FORMS

NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. COVERAGES INCLUDE PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL

AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF UMBRELLA.

7

PUBLIC SECTOR SERVICES

MARKETS

INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MUNICIPALITIES, COUNTIES, INDIAN NATION

GAMING AND SELECTED SPECIAL GOVERNMENT DISTRICTS, INCLUDING WATER AND SEWER

UTILITIES, AND NON-RAIL TRANSIT AUTHORITIES. THE POLICIES WRITTEN BY THIS

BUSINESS CENTER TYPICALLY COVER PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY,

WORKERS COMPENSATION AND ERRORS AND OMISSIONS EXPOSURES.

DISCOVER RE,

WHICH

PRINCIPALLY PROVIDES COMMERCIAL AUTO LIABILITY, GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS

COMPENSATION, AND PROPERTY COVERAGES, SERVES RETAIL BROKERS AND INSUREDS THAT

ARE COMMITTED TO THE ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER MARKET. ALTERNATIVE RISK

TRANSFER TECHNIQUES ARE TYPICALLY UTILIZED BY SOPHISTICATED INSUREDS THAT ARE

FINANCIALLY ABLE TO ASSUME A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THEIR OWN LOSSES.

DISCOVER RE

IS ORGANIZED IN TWO UNDERWRITING UNITS, EACH OF

WHICH UNDERWRITES PRIMARY INSURANCE IN CONNECTION WITH ARRANGEMENTS THAT

INVOLVE THE CLIENT OR A CAPTIVE INSURER AGREEING TO BEAR MUCH OF THE COVERED

RISK. THE INDIVIDUAL RISK UNIT MARKETS PRODUCTS TO INDIVIDUAL INSUREDS THAT ARE

COMFORTABLE RETAINING THE MORE PREDICTABLE LAYER OF THEIR EXPECTED LOSSES

THROUGH EITHER LARGE DEDUCTIBLE OR TRUE SELF-INSURED RETENTION PROGRAMS. UNDER

A LARGE DEDUCTIBLE STRUCTURE, WE ARE EXPOSED NOT ONLY TO THE RISK OF LOSS UNDER

THE POLICY BUT ALSO TO THE RISK OF THE INSUREDS INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS TO

PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT. WE MITIGATE THE LATTER

RISK BY COLLATERALIZING ALL OR A PORTION OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES IN THE INSUREDS

RETAINED LAYER. THE SECOND UNDERWRITING UNIT IS THE CAPTIVE/PROGRAM UNIT, WHICH

FOCUSES ON CAPTIVE BUSINESS. SIMILAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL RISK ACCOUNTS, THE

CAPTIVES RETAIN THE MORE PREDICTABLE FREQUENCY LAYER OF EXPECTED LOSSES, WITH

DISCOVER RE

PROVIDING EXCESS COVERAGE ABOVE THE CAPTIVES

RETENTION. IN SOME INSTANCES THE CAPTIVE/PROGRAM UNIT MAY RETAIN LITTLE OR NO

RISK, BUT EARNS REVENUES PRIMARILY FROM FEES COLLECTED FOR PROVIDING ACCESS TO

POLICIES FROM AN ADMITTED INSURANCE COMPANY.

OIL AND GAS

PROVIDES

SPECIALIZED PROPERTY AND LIABILITY PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS INVOLVED IN THE

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS INCLUDING OPERATORS, DRILLERS AND

SERVICING CONTRACTORS. THE POLICIES WRITTEN BY THIS BUSINESS CENTER INSURE

DRILLING RIGS, NATURAL GAS FACILITIES, PIPELINES, PRODUCTION AND GATHERING

PLATFORMS, AND COVER RISKS INCLUDING PHYSICAL DAMAGE, LIABILITY AND BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION.

OCEAN MARINE

UNDERWRITES

A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF COVERAGES FOR ALL FORMS OF MARINE TRANSPORTATION AND THE

COMPANIES THAT SERVE THEM, AS WELL AS OTHER BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN

INTERNATIONAL TRADE. OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS FALL UNDER FOUR MAIN COVERAGE

CATEGORIES:  MARINE LIABILITY; CARGO;

HULL AND MACHINERY, PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY; AND MARINE PROPERTY-LIABILITY.

PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK

UNDERWRITES

PERSONAL PROPERTY COVERAGES IN CERTAIN STATES EXPOSED TO EARTHQUAKES AND

HURRICANES, INCLUDING PRINCIPALLY CALIFORNIA, TEXAS AND FLORIDA. AS WITH OUR

COMMERCIAL CATASTROPHE RISK COVERAGES UNDERWRITTEN IN OUR COMMERCIAL LINES

SEGMENT, A SINGLE LOSS EVENT MAY PRODUCE HEAVY LOSSES UNDER A NUMBER OF

POLICIES. WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED THROUGH NATURAL

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE. THE NATURAL CATASTROPHE RISK MANAGEMENT

SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT, WHICH

INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF OUR NATURAL CATASTROPHE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES, IS

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

OUR

INTERNATIONAL & LLOYDS

OPERATION

CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, AND

OUR ONGOING SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES,

INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS CENTER (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO

HEREAFTER AS INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTIES).

LLOYDS IS A SUBSCRIPTION

INSURANCE MARKET IN WHICH MEMBER INDIVIDUALS AND FIRMS PARTICIPATE TO PROVIDE

INSURANCE TO CUSTOMERS SEEKING COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF RISKS. THE MEMBERS OF

LLOYDS ARE ORGANIZED INTO SYNDICATES CONSISTING OF ONE OR MORE MEMBERS. THE

MEMBERS PROVIDE UNDERWRITING CAPACITY WITH WHICH THE SYNDICATE MAKES COVERAGE

AVAILABLE TO PARTICULAR CUSTOMERS. SYNDICATES ARE OPERATED BY MANAGING AGENCIES

THAT RECEIVE FEES IN RESPECT OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE IN BOTH UNDERWRITING

AND CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION. COVERAGE IS PLACED BY INSURANCE BROKERS ACTING ON

BEHALF OF INSUREDS.

IN 2003 AT LLOYDS, WE

UNDERWROTE FOUR PRINCIPAL LINES OF BUSINESSAVIATION, MARINE, GLOBAL PROPERTY

AND PERSONAL LINESTHROUGH A SINGLE SYNDICATE FOR WHICH WE PROVIDE 100% OF THE

CAPITAL. THIS SYNDICATE

8

WAS

ESTABLISHED IN 1996 AS SYNDICATE 1211 AND RE-BRANDED AS SYNDICATE 5000 IN NOVEMBER 2002.

AVIATION UNDERWRITES A BROAD SPECTRUM OF INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE, MANUFACTURER,

AIRPORT AND GENERAL AVIATION BUSINESS. MARINE UNDERWRITES ENERGY, CARGO AND

HULL COVERAGES. GLOBAL PROPERTY UNDERWRITES PROPERTY COVERAGES WORLDWIDE. PERSONAL

LINES PROVIDES SPECIALIZED ACCIDENT AND HEALTH COVERAGES FOR INTERNATIONAL

CLIENTS, INCLUDING PERSONAL ACCIDENT, KIDNAP AND RANSOM, AND PAYMENT PROTECTION

INSURANCE. PRIOR TO 2003, THE AVIATION AND PERSONAL LINES BUSINESSES WERE

UNDERWRITTEN THROUGH OTHER SYNDICATES THAT WE MANAGED AND IN WHICH WE

PARTICIPATED WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF LLOYDS. WE DO NOT PROVIDE SYNDICATE 5000

WITH DIRECT CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT RATHER OBTAIN BANK LETTERS OF CREDIT TO

SUPPORT THE SYNDICATES INSURANCE EXPOSURE. WE ARE LIABLE, HOWEVER, IF THESE

LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE CALLED UPON TO COVER ANY LOSSES OF THE SYNDICATE AND MUST

REIMBURSE THE BANKS THAT ISSUE THE LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR ANY AMOUNTS THEY PAY

ON OUR BEHALF.

IN ADDITION TO THE

PROPERTY-LIABILITY BUSINESS WE UNDERWRITE AT LLOYDS, WE ALSO MANAGE, AND HAVE

MADE A COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE 13% OF THE CAPACITY OF, SYNDICATE 779 AT LLOYDS,

WHICH UNDERWRITES SPECIALTY TERM LIFE INSURANCE TO INDIVIDUALS PRIMARILY IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

IN DECEMBER 2003, WE

COMPLETED THE SALE OF CAMPERDOWN UK LIMITED, ONE OF OUR LLOYDS CORPORATE NAMES

AND THE VEHICLE FOR OUR PARTICIPATION ON THE 2003 AND PRIOR YEARS OF ACCOUNT,

TO FOLTUS INVESTMENTS LIMITED. WE RECOGNIZED A $2 MILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THIS

TRANSACTION. IN 2003, FIRE AND MARINE ENTERED INTO A 100% QUOTA SHARE

REINSURANCE AGREEMENT DIRECTLY WITH SYNDICATE 5000 THAT IN EFFECT TRANSFERRED

SYNDICATE 5000S UNDERWRITING RESULTS FOR THE 2003 YEAR OF ACCOUNT TO FIRE AND

MARINE. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, WE ACTIVATED

TWO CORPORATE NAMES THAT WILL BE USED FOR 2004 AND FUTURE YEARS OF ACCOUNT TO

UNDERWRITE SYNDICATE 5000 BUSINESS.

OUR ONGOING INTERNATIONAL

SPECIALTIES ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF

IRELAND, WHERE WE OFFER SPECIALIZED INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO A

VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTORS. OUR ONGOING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS PRIMARILY

UNDERWRITE EMPLOYERS LIABILITY (SIMILAR TO WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE IN

THE U.S.), PUBLIC AND PRODUCT LIABILITY (THE EQUIVALENT OF GENERAL LIABILITY),

PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY (SIMILAR TO DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OR ERRORS AND

OMISSIONS COVERAGE), MOTOR (SIMILAR TO AUTOMOBILE COVERAGE IN THE UNITED

STATES) AND PROPERTY. THE GLOBAL UNDERWRITING BUSINESS CENTER UNDERWRITES HOME-FOREIGN

BUSINESS, REPRESENTING COVERAGE FOR A U.S. ORGANIZATIONS PROPERTY-LIABILITY

EXPOSURES IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, AND REVERSE-FLOW BUSINESS, WHICH INVOLVES COVERAGE

OF A FOREIGN ORGANIZATIONS PROPERTY OR LIABILITY EXPOSURES LOCATED IN THE

UNITED STATES, AS PART OF A GLOBAL PROGRAM.

THE

MIDDLE MARKET COMMERCIAL

BUSINESS CENTER

OFFERS COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE COVERAGES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF MANUFACTURING,

WHOLESALE, SERVICE AND RETAIL ENTERPRISES FOR WHICH ANNUAL INSURANCE COSTS

TYPICALLY RANGE FROM $75,000 TO $1 MILLION, AS WELL AS PROGRAMS FOR SELECTED

INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NATIONAL IN SCOPE AND HAVE SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS

SUCH AS FRANCHISES AND ASSOCIATIONS. THE MAJORITY OF THESE PROGRAMS WERE

FORMERLY CLASSIFIED AS A SEPARATE SPECIALTY PROGRAMS BUSINESS CENTER IN OUR

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT BUT WERE RECLASSIFIED IN 2003 TO OUR

MIDDLE MARKET COMMERCIAL

BUSINESS CENTER

IN THE COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH

THIS BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN AND MANAGED. SPECIFIC LINES OF INSURANCE

UNDERWRITTEN THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL

LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, INLAND MARINE, ERRORS AND OMISSIONS, UMBRELLA

AND FIDELITY. UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES, PREMIUMS AND POLICY FORMS ISSUED VARY BY

PROGRAM AND BY JURISDICTION BECAUSE OF LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND LEGAL

REQUIREMENTS. COVERAGE MAY BE ON A PRIMARY OR AN EXCESS BASIS, DEPENDING ON HOW

THE COVERAGE IS STRUCTURED FOR A PARTICULAR INSURED. BECAUSE OF THE

NATIONAL

SCOPE OF THE PROGRAMS UNDERWRITTEN, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO UNUSUALLY LARGE LOSSES

IF A SINGLE INDUSTRY WHOSE MEMBERS ARE INSURED THROUGH AN ASSOCIATION IS

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A MAJOR EVENT OR DEVELOPMENT, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

EVENT OR DEVELOPMENT CAUSES LOSSES THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. THE

MIDDLE MARKET COMMERCIAL

BUSINESS CENTER

ALSO OFFERS LOSS-SENSITIVE CASUALTY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEDUCTIBLE

AND SELF-INSURED RETENTION OPTIONS, FOR THE HIGHER END OF THE MIDDLE MARKET

SECTOR.

THE

COMBINES OUR LARGE ACCOUNT PROPERTY BUSINESS WITH THE COMMERCIAL PORTION OF OUR

CATASTROPHE RISK BUSINESS AND ALLOWS US TO TAKE A UNIFIED APPROACH TO LARGE

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY RISKS. LARGE ACCOUNTS ARE TYPICALLY THOSE WITH PROPERTY

PREMIUMS GREATER THAN $100,000. THIS BUSINESS CENTER FOCUSES ON UNDERWRITING

PROPERTY COVERAGES FOR REAL PROPERTIES EXPOSED TO LIGHT TO MODERATE HAZARDS,

SUCH AS HOTELS AND OFFICE BUILDINGS, RATHER THAN HIGH HAZARD PROPERTIES SUCH AS

PETROCHEMICAL, MINING AND OTHER BASIC PROCESS INDUSTRIES. MANY OF THE PRODUCTS

UNDERWRITTEN BY THIS BUSINESS CENTER ARE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, IN WHICH WE WRITE

COVERAGE FOR A SPECIFIED LAYER OF RISK AND OTHER INSURERS UNDERWRITE OTHER

LAYERS. SOME OF THE POLICIES UNDERWRITTEN BY THIS BUSINESS CENTER EXPOSE US TO

CATASTROPHE RISK, PRINCIPALLY EARTHQUAKE AND HURRICANE, IN WHICH A SINGLE LOSS

EVENT CAN PRODUCE HEAVY LOSSES UNDER A NUMBER OF POLICIES. THE STRUCTURING, OR

LAYERING, OF RISK AS DESCRIBED ABOVE RESULTS IN OUR BEING LESS EXPOSED (BEFORE

THE EFFECT OF REINSURANCE) TO SUCH CATASTROPHE RISK THAN IF WE WROTE

TRADITIONAL FULL LIMITS PROPERTY POLICIES. TO FURTHER MANAGE OUR RISK, WE

PURCHASE REINSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES. OUR EFFORTS TO MANAGE

THE RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED FROM NATURAL CATASTROPHE COVERAGE ARE

DESCRIBED IN THE NATURAL CATASTROPHE RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

RESULTS FROM OUR

PARTICIPATION IN INVOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS ARE ALSO INCLUDED

IN THE COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT.

STATE INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE US TO PARTICIPATE IN

MANDATORY PROPERTY-LIABILITY POOLING ARRANGEMENTS THAT PROVIDE INSURANCE

COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHERS WHO OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE COVERAGE

OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS

IN THE UNITED STATES ARE LICENSED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN ALL 50 STATES, THE

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO, GUAM AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS. AT LEAST FIVE

PERCENT OF FIRE AND MARINES 2003 DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUMS WERE PRODUCED IN EACH

OF CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, TEXAS AND FLORIDA.

OUR INSURANCE BUSINESS IN

THE UNITED STATES IS PRODUCED PRIMARILY THROUGH OVER 5,000 INDEPENDENT

INSURANCE AGENCIES AND INSURANCE BROKERS. THE NEEDS OF AGENTS, BROKERS AND

POLICYHOLDERS ARE ADDRESSED THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 115 OFFICES LOCATED

THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. DISCOVER RE, A COMPONENT OF OUR SPECIALTY

COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, UNDERWRITES ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER BUSINESS FROM ITS

FARMINGTON, CT HEADQUARTERS AND FROM REGIONAL OFFICES IN ATLANTA, PITTSBURGH,

HOUSTON AND SAN FRANCISCO.

OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS ARE HEADQUARTERED IN LONDON AND UNDERWRITE INSURANCE PRIMARILY

THROUGH DOMESTIC OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF

IRELAND. WE ALSO UNDERWRITE SURETY BUSINESS IN MEXICO.

THROUGH OUR INVOLVEMENT AT

LLOYDS, WE HAVE ACCESS TO INSURANCE MARKETS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTRY IN THE

WORLD. AT OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, WE UNDERWRITE PROPERTY-LIABILITY

BUSINESS THROUGH A SINGLE SYNDICATE (SYNDICATE 5000) AND SPECIALTY LIFE

INSURANCE THROUGH OUR 13% PARTICIPATION IN SYNDICATE 779. OUR MANAGING AGENCY,

OPERATING UNDER THE NAME ST. PAUL SYNDICATE MANAGEMENT LTD., UNDERWRITES

BUSINESS FOR THESE SYNDICATES, WHICH REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 2% OF LLOYDS

TOTAL CAPACITY.

RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

GENERAL INFORMATION.

WHEN

CLAIMS ARE MADE BY OR AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, ANY AMOUNTS THAT OUR UNDERWRITING

OPERATIONS PAY OR EXPECT TO PAY TO THE CLAIMANT ARE REFERRED TO AS LOSSES. THE

COSTS OF INVESTIGATING, RESOLVING AND PROCESSING THESE CLAIMS ARE REFERRED TO

AS LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES (LAE). OUR LOSS RESERVES REFLECT ESTIMATES OF

TOTAL LOSSES AND LAE WE WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE TO PAY UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES,

SURETY BONDS AND REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE RESERVES FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 COVER CLAIMS THAT WERE INCURRED NOT ONLY IN 2003 BUT

ALSO IN PRIOR YEARS. THEY INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL COST OF CLAIMS THAT

HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPORTED BUT NOT YET SETTLED (CASE RESERVES),

12

AND

THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED (IBNR RESERVES). LOSS

RESERVES ARE REDUCED FOR ESTIMATES OF SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.

LOSS RESERVES FOR TABULAR

WORKERS COMPENSATION BUSINESS AND CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE

DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT VALUE. TABULAR WORKERS COMPENSATION RESERVES ARE

INDEMNITY RESERVES THAT ARE CALCULATED USING DISCOUNTS DETERMINED WITH

REFERENCE TO ACTUARIAL TABLES THAT INCORPORATE INTEREST AND CONTINGENCIES SUCH

AS MORTALITY, REMARRIAGE, INFLATION OR RECOVERY FROM DISABILITY APPLIED TO A

REASONABLY DETERMINABLE PAYMENT STREAM. RESERVES FOR MEDICAL COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE WORK PLACE INJURY AND RESERVES FOR LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES ARE NOT

DISCOUNTED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE DISCOUNTED LIABILITIES IS SET

FORTH IN NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS

REPORT. DURING 2003, $2 MILLION OF DISCOUNT WAS AMORTIZED AND $5 MILLION OF

ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT WAS ACCRUED.

BECAUSE MANY OF THE

COVERAGES WE OFFER INVOLVE CLAIMS THAT MAY NOT ULTIMATELY BE SETTLED FOR MANY

YEARS AFTER THEY ARE INCURRED, SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AS TO OUR ULTIMATE EXPOSURE

TO LOSSES ARE AN INTEGRAL AND NECESSARY COMPONENT OF OUR LOSS RESERVING PROCESS.

WE RECORD OUR RESERVES BY CONSIDERING A RANGE OF ESTIMATES BOUNDED BY A HIGH

AND LOW POINT. WITHIN THAT RANGE, WE RECORD OUR BEST ESTIMATE. WE CONTINUALLY

REVIEW OUR RESERVES, USING A VARIETY OF STATISTICAL AND ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES TO

ANALYZE CURRENT CLAIM COSTS, FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY DATA, AND PREVAILING

ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND LEGAL FACTORS. WE ADJUST RESERVES ESTABLISHED IN PRIOR

YEARS AS LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. ADJUSTMENTS

TO PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED RESERVES ARE REFLECTED IN RESULTS IN THE YEAR IN WHICH

THEY ARE MADE.

WHILE

WE BELIEVE OUR REPORTED RESERVES MAKE A REASONABLE PROVISION FOR ALL OF OUR

UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE OBLIGATIONS, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT

THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING REQUIRED RESERVES DOES, BY ITS VERY NATURE, INVOLVE

UNCERTAINTY. THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY CAN BE INFLUENCED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE

EXISTENCE OF LONG-TAIL COVERAGES (WHICH WE CONSIDER TO BE BUSINESS IN WHICH THE

MAJORITY OF COVERAGES INVOLVE AVERAGE LOSS PAYMENT LAGS OF THREE YEARS OR MORE

BEYOND THE EXPIRATION OF THE POLICY), AND CHANGES IN CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES. MANY

OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN LONG-TAIL COVERAGES, AND THE

PRIMARY LINES OF BUSINESS FITTING THAT CRITERION ARE GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS

COMPENSATION AND CASUALTY EXCESS REINSURANCE. IN ADDITION, CLAIM HANDLING

PRACTICES CHANGE AND EVOLVE OVER THE YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW INITIATIVES ARE

COMMENCED, CLAIM OFFICES ARE REORGANIZED AND RELOCATED, CLAIM HANDLING

RESPONSIBILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL ADJUSTERS ARE CHANGED, USE OF A CALL CENTER IS

INCREASED, USE OF TECHNOLOGY IS INCREASED, CASELOAD ISSUES AND CASE RESERVING

PRACTICES ARE MONITORED MORE FREQUENTLY, ETC. FURTHERMORE, ESTABLISHING

RESERVES FOR OUR REINSURANCE AND RETROCESSIONAL BUSINESS IS INFLUENCED BY OUR

NEED TO RELY ON THE CEDING INSURERS AND REINSURERS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING

REPORTED CLAIMS. HOWEVER, ALL OF THE ABOVE FACTORS ARE SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY

THAT WE HAVE RECOGNIZED IN ESTABLISHING OUR RESERVES.

THE LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

INCLUDED IN ITEM 7 OF THIS REPORT INCLUDES MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR LOSS

RESERVES, INCLUDING AN ANALYSIS OF OUR LONG-TAIL EXPOSURES.

TEN-YEAR DEVELOPMENT.

THE

TABLE THAT FOLLOWS PRESENTS A DEVELOPMENT OF NET LOSS AND LAE RESERVE

LIABILITIES AND PAYMENTS FOR THE YEARS 1993 THROUGH 2003. THE TOP LINE ON THE

TABLE SHOWS THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE, NET OF

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, RECORDED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE FOR EACH OF THE

YEARS INDICATED.

THE TABLE EXCLUDES THE

RESERVES AND ACTIVITY OF ECONOMY FIRE AND CASUALTY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

(ECONOMY), WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN THE SALE OF OUR STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCE

OPERATIONS TO METROPOLITAN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY (METROPOLITAN)

IN 1999. THE TABLE DOES, HOWEVER, INCLUDE RESERVES AND ACTIVITY FOR THE

NON-ECONOMY STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCE BUSINESS THAT WAS SOLD TO METROPOLITAN,

SINCE WE REMAIN LIABLE FOR CLAIMS ON NON-ECONOMY STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCE

POLICIES THAT RESULT FROM LOSSES OCCURRING PRIOR TO SEPT. 30, 1999 (THE CLOSING

DATE OF THE SALE). THE RECONCILIATION OF LOSS RESERVES TABLE IN NOTE 8 TO OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF THIS

13

REPORT

INCLUDES THE RESERVE ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE NON-ECONOMY CLAIMS, AS ACTIVITY

ON RESERVES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2003, WE

COMPLETED THE SALE OF CAMPERDOWN UK LIMITED, ONE OF OUR LLOYDS CORPORATE NAMES

AND THE VEHICLE FOR OUR PARTICIPATION ON THE 2003 AND PRIOR YEARS OF ACCOUNT,

TO FOLTUS INVESTMENTS LIMITED. THE $944 MILLION OF NET RESERVES TRANSFERRED AS

PART OF THE SALE ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET RESERVES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2003 IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. YEARS PRIOR TO 2003 IN THE TABLE INCLUDE THE

CAMPERDOWN UK LIMITED RESERVES, AS WELL AS LOSS DEVELOPMENT AND PAYMENTS

RELATED TO THOSE RESERVES.

WHEN WE ACQUIRE AN

INSURANCE UNDERWRITING COMPANY, WE INCLUDE LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR THE ACQUIRED

COMPANY IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE BEGINNING WITH THE DATE OF ACQUISITION; HOWEVER,

THAT DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES ACTIVITY FROM PERIODS PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION.

THE UPPER PORTION OF THE

TABLE, WHICH SHOWS THE RE-ESTIMATED AMOUNTS RELATING TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED

LIABILITIES, IS BASED UPON EXPERIENCE AS OF THE END OF EACH SUCCEEDING YEAR. THESE

ESTIMATES ARE EITHER INCREASED OR DECREASED AS FURTHER INFORMATION BECOMES

KNOWN ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS AND AS CHANGES IN THE TREND OF CLAIM FREQUENCY

AND SEVERITY BECOME APPARENT.

THE CUMULATIVE REDUNDANCY

(DEFICIENCY) LINE ON THE TABLE FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR REPRESENTS THE AGGREGATE

CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATES FOR ALL YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO THE YEAR THE RESERVES WERE

INITIALLY ESTABLISHED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 1994 NET RESERVE OF $12,997 MILLION

DEVELOPED TO $12,227 MILLION, OR A $770 MILLION REDUNDANCY, BY THE END OF 1996.

BY THE END OF 2003, THE 1994 RESERVE HAD DEVELOPED A REDUNDANCY OF $1,812

MILLION. THE CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE OF 1994 LOSS RESERVES WERE REFLECTED IN

OPERATIONS DURING THE PAST NINE YEARS. LIKEWISE, THE DEFICIENCY THAT DEVELOPED

WITH RESPECT TO YEAR-END 2001 RESERVES (PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR MEDICAL

LIABILITY BUSINESS) WAS REFLECTED IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2003 AND

2002.

THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE

TABLE REPRESENTS A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE NET RESERVE LIABILITY AS SHOWN ON

THE TOP LINE OF THE TABLE AND THE GROSS RESERVE LIABILITY AS SHOWN ON OUR

BALANCE SHEET. THIS PORTION OF THE TABLE ALSO PRESENTS THE GROSS RE-ESTIMATED

RESERVE LIABILITY AS OF THE END OF THE LATEST RE-ESTIMATION PERIOD (DECEMBER 31,

2003) AND THE RELATED RE-ESTIMATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE.

THE LOWER PORTION OF THE

TABLE PRESENTS THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID WITH RESPECT TO THE PREVIOUSLY

RECORDED LIABILITY AS OF THE END OF EACH SUCCEEDING YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003, $9,640 MILLION OF THE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED $11,185 MILLION OF NET LOSSES

AND LAE THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED FOR THE YEARS UP TO AND INCLUDING 1994 HAVE

BEEN PAID. THUS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT $1,545

MILLION OF NET INCURRED LOSSES AND LAE HAVE YET TO BE PAID FOR THE YEARS UP TO

AND INCLUDING 1994.

CAUTION SHOULD BE

EXERCISED IN EVALUATING THE INFORMATION SHOWN IN THIS TABLE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED

THAT EACH AMOUNT INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF ALL CHANGES IN AMOUNTS FOR PRIOR

PERIODS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PORTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT SHOWN FOR YEAR-END 1999

RESERVES THAT RELATES TO 1994 LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE REDUNDANCY

(DEFICIENCY) FOR THE YEARS 1994 THROUGH 1999.

IN ADDITION, THE TABLE

PRESENTS CALENDAR YEAR DATA. IT DOES NOT PRESENT ACCIDENT OR POLICY YEAR

DEVELOPMENT DATA, WHICH SOME READERS MAY BE MORE ACCUSTOMED TO ANALYZING. THE

SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL CONDITIONS AND OTHER TRENDS WHICH HAVE HAD AN IMPACT

ON THE CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN THE PAST ARE NOT NECESSARILY

INDICATIVE OF THE FUTURE. ACCORDINGLY, READERS ARE CAUTIONED AGAINST

EXTRAPOLATING ANY CONCLUSIONS ABOUT FUTURE RESULTS FROM THE INFORMATION

PRESENTED IN THIS TABLE.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING OUR LOSS RESERVE LIABILITIES, SEE NOTE 8 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT, WHICH INCLUDES A

NATURAL CATASTROPHE

RISK MANAGEMENT

OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US

TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF NATURAL CATASTROPHES, AS WELL AS TERRORISM. NATURAL

CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS EVENTS, BUT LOSSES ARE PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN

BY HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL

CATASTROPHES AND TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY

MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY IN A GIVEN PERIOD OR EVEN HARM OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF

BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AFFECTED AREA AND THE SEVERITY

OF THE EVENT.

MOST CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC

AREAS; HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE,

ESPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. MOST OF THE CATASTROPHE-RELATED

CLAIMS IN OUR ONGOING BUSINESSES IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS HAVE RELATED TO

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY COVERAGES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION

OF OUR BUSINESS SUBJECTS US TO NATURAL CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY FROM

HURRICANES IN FLORIDA AND THE MID-ATLANTIC, NORTHEAST, AND GULF COAST REGIONS,

AS WELL AS EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA, ALONG THE NEW MADRID FAULT LINE AND IN

THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGION.

WE ATTEMPT TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS USING CATASTROPHE MODELS DEVELOPED BY OUTSIDE VENDORS. MODELS

ARE APPLIED TO EVALUATE OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSSES ARISING FROM INDIVIDUAL

CONTRACTS AND IN THE AGGREGATE. UNDERWRITING CONTROLS AND SYSTEMS EXIST TO

ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS CONFORM TO OUR RISK TOLERANCE, FIT WITHIN OUR

EXISTING EXPOSURE PORTFOLIO, AND ARE PRICED AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS.

WE RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON REINSURANCE TO LIMIT OUR

EXPOSURE TO NATURAL CATASTROPHES. REINSURANCE EXISTS BOTH AT AN ACCOUNT LEVEL

AND AT THE PORTFOLIO LEVEL, WHERE WE PURCHASE A SPECIFIC NATURAL CATASTROPHE

REINSURANCE TREATY. IN THE EVENT THAT REINSURANCE CAPACITY PROVIDING NATURAL

CATASTROPHE PROTECTION BECOMES LIMITED, WE WOULD ADJUST OUR DIRECT EXPOSURES

ACCORDINGLY.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT OUR UNDERWRITING RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAMS

WILL LIMIT ACTUAL LOSSES TO A LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH OUR RISK TOLERANCE. LOSSES

FROM AN INDIVIDUAL CATASTROPHE, OR A SERIES OF CATASTROPHES, MAY MATERIALLY EXCEED

SUCH AMOUNT. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY FROM THE EXPECTATIONS DEVELOPED IN OUR

CATASTROPHE MODELING, AND SUCH VARIANCES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REINSURERS

AND THE RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES.

CEDED REINSURANCE

PURPOSE.

WHEN WE PURCHASE REINSURANCE OR CEDE

INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND RISKS, OTHER INSURERS OR REINSURERS AGREE TO SHARE

CERTAIN RISKS THAT WE HAVE UNDERWRITTEN. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF REINSURANCE IS

TO LIMIT A CEDING INSURERS MAXIMUM NET LOSS FROM INDIVIDUALLY LARGE OR

AGGREGATE RISKS AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST CATASTROPHES. OUR

REINSURANCE PROGRAM IS GENERALLY MANAGED FROM A CORPORATE RISK-TOLERANCE

PERSPECTIVE. REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ADDRESSING SPECIFIC BUSINESS CENTER RISKS

ARE UTILIZED ON A LIMITED BASIS TO COVER UNIQUE EXPOSURES AS NECESSARY. OUR

REINSURANCE PROGRAM ADDRESSES RISK THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PER-RISK

REINSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS PROTECTING AGAINST THE AGGREGATION OF

RISK EXPOSURES. FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE, WHICH COVERS SPECIFIC RISKS, IS ALSO

USED TO SUPPLEMENT OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM. UNTIL THE TRANSFER OF OUR ONGOING

REINSURANCE OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM IN NOVEMBER 2002, WE UNDERWROTE ASSUMED

REINSURANCE COVERAGES ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS.

PRICE INCREASES AND PRESSURES ON CONTRACT TERMS AND

CONDITIONS CONTINUE IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET. DESPITE THESE CONSTRAINTS, OUR

REINSURANCE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO SUPPORT OUR PRIMARY UNDERWRITING REINSURANCE

NEEDS, PARTICULARLY AS INCREASES IN RATES AND REDUCTIONS IN LIMITS ALSO

CONTINUE IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET.

CREDITWORTHINESS

OF REINSURERS.

APPROXIMATELY

94% OF OUR REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WERE WITH

REINSURANCE COMPANIES HAVING FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS OF A- OR HIGHER BY A.M

BEST OR STANDARD & POORS, WERE FROM STATE SPONSORED FACILITIES OR

REINSURANCE POOLS, OR WERE COLLATERALIZED REINSURANCE PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED WITH

CERTAIN OF OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS. WE HAVE AN

16

INTERNAL CREDIT SECURITY

COMMITTEE, WHICH USES A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK REVIEW PROCESS IN SELECTING

OUR REINSURERS. THIS PROCESS CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS RATINGS BY MAJOR RATINGS

AGENCIES, FINANCIAL CONDITION, PARENTAL SUPPORT, OPERATING PRACTICES, AND

MARKET NEWS AND DEVELOPMENTS. THE CREDIT SECURITY COMMITTEE CONVENES QUARTERLY

TO EVALUATE THESE FACTORS AND TAKE ACTION ON OUR APPROVED LIST OF REINSURERS,

AS NECESSARY.

WE MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE

REINSURANCE, WHICH IS EVALUATED AND ADJUSTED ON A REGULAR BASIS TO REFLECT

DISPUTED COVERAGES AND CHANGING MARKET AND CREDIT CONDITIONS. OUR ALLOWANCE FOR

UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE

BALANCES WAS 1.9% AND 1.5% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

IN

2001, WE ENTERED INTO TWO AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATIES. ONE OF

THESE TREATIES WAS CORPORATE-WIDE, WITH COVERAGE TRIGGERED WHEN OUR INSURANCE

LOSSES AND LAE ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS REACHED A CERTAIN LEVEL, AS

PRESCRIBED BY TERMS OF THE TREATY (THE CORPORATE PROGRAM). WE DID NOT ENTER

INTO SUCH A TREATY IN 2002 OR 2003. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REINSURANCE OPERATION WAS

IMPACTED BY CESSIONS MADE UNDER A SEPARATE TREATY IN 2001 AND 2002 UNRELATED TO

THE CORPORATE TREATY. THE COMBINED IMPACT OF THESE TREATIES (TOGETHER, THE REINSURANCE

TREATIES) IS INCLUDED IN THE TABLE THAT FOLLOWS.

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT PROVIDES A

SCHEDULE OF CEDED REINSURANCE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE REINSURANCE

TREATIES.

UNTIL THE TRANSFER OF OUR

ONGOING REINSURANCE OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD. (PLATINUM)

IN NOVEMBER 2002, WE UNDERWROTE ASSUMED REINSURANCE COVERAGES ON A

WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE REMAIN LIABLE ON ALL REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH INCEPTION

DATES PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2002, AS WELL AS ON CERTAIN 2002 CONTRACTS THAT

WERE NOT TRANSFERRED TO PLATINUM. NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

TRANSFER OF OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM.

TERRORISM RISK AND

LEGISLATION

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED INTO

LAW THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 (TRIA). TRIA ESTABLISHED A

TEMPORARY FEDERAL PROGRAM WHICH REQUIRES U.S. AND OTHER INSURERS TO OFFER

COVERAGE IN THEIR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES FOR LOSSES

RESULTING FROM TERRORISTS ACTS COMMITTED BY FOREIGN PERSONS OR INTERESTS IN

THE UNITED STATES OR WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIED U.S. AIR CARRIERS, VESSELS OR

MISSIONS ABROAD. THE COVERAGE OFFERED MAY NOT DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE TERMS,

AMOUNTS AND OTHER COVERAGE LIMITATIONS APPLICABLE TO OTHER POLICY COVERAGES. THESE

REQUIREMENTS TERMINATE AT THE END OF 2004 UNLESS THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

EXTENDS THEM TO 2005.

UNDER TRIA, THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

DETERMINES WHETHER AN ACT IS A COVERED TERRORIST ACT, AND IF IT IS COVERED,

LOSSES RESULTING FROM THAT ACT ULTIMATELY ARE SHARED AMONG INSURERS, THE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND POLICYHOLDERS. GENERALLY, INSURERS PAY ALL LOSSES TO

POLICYHOLDERS, RETAINING A DEFINED DEDUCTIBLE AND 10% OF LOSSES ABOVE THAT

DEDUCTIBLE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE INSURERS FOR 90% OF LOSSES

ABOVE THE DEDUCTIBLE AND, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

WILL REQUIRE INSURERS TO LEVY SURCHARGES ON POLICYHOLDERS TO RECOUP FOR THE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITS REIMBURSEMENTS PAID.

17

AN INSURERS DEDUCTIBLE IN

2003 WAS 7% OF THE INSURERS 2002 DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS, AND RISES TO 10% OF

2003 DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2004 AND, IF THE PROGRAM CONTINUES IN 2005, 15%

OF 2004 DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2005. FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT OF THE INSURANCE

INDUSTRY IS LIMITED TO $100 BILLION IN EACH OF 2003, 2004 AND 2005, AND NO

INSURER THAT HAS MET ITS DEDUCTIBLE SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ITS

PORTION OF THE AGGREGATE INDUSTRY INSURED LOSS THAT EXCEEDS $100 BILLION,

THEREBY CAPPING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRYS AND EACH INSURERS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE

TO TERRORIST ACTS COVERED BY TRIA.

TRIA VOIDED TERRORIST EXCLUSIONS IN POLICIES IN-FORCE

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002 TO THE EXTENT OF THE TRIA COVERAGE REQUIRED TO BE

OFFERED AND IMPOSED REQUIREMENTS ON INSURERS TO OFFER THE TRIA COVERAGE TO

POLICYHOLDERS AT RATES CHOSEN BY THE INSURERS ON POLICIES IN-FORCE ON NOVEMBER 26,

2002 AND ALL POLICIES RENEWED OR NEWLY OFFERED THEREAFTER. POLICYHOLDERS MAY

ACCEPT OR DECLINE COVERAGE AT THE OFFERED RATE AND, WITH RESPECT TO POLICIES

IN-FORCE ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, TRIA COVERAGE REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL THE

POLICYHOLDER FAILS TO PURCHASE THE COVERAGE WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD FOLLOWING

THE INSURERS RATE QUOTATION FOR THE TRIA COVERAGE. WE HAVE FULLY IMPLEMENTED

OUR LONG-TERM RATING PLANS IN ALL STATES.

WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR TRIAS IMPACT ON THE INSURANCE

INDUSTRY GENERALLY AND ON US SPECIFICALLY. OUR DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

AND CERTAIN BUSINESS WE UNDERWRITE THROUGH LLOYDS ARE SUBJECT TO TRIA AND, IN

THE EVENT OF A TERRORIST ACT COVERED BY TRIA, COVERAGE WOULD ATTACH AFTER

LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $690 MILLION (CALCULATED BASED ON 10% OF OUR

TRIA-QUALIFYING CALENDAR YEAR 2003 DIRECT EARNED PREMIUM TOTAL). ACCORDINGLY,

TRIAS FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT PROVISIONS ALONE DO NOT PROTECT US FROM LOSSES

FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ACTS THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY IN

DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE RATES FOR OFFERING TRIA COVERAGE (AND COVERAGE FOR

TERRORIST ACTS GENERALLY), AND OUR QUOTED RATES COULD BE TOO LOW AND ATTRACT

POOR RISKS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, COULD BE HIGHER THAN OUR COMPETITORS AND RESULT

IN THE LOSS OF BUSINESS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS INTERPRETIVE ISSUES IN CONNECTION

WITH TRIAS IMPLEMENTATION BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY THAT REMAIN TO BE

RESOLVED, INCLUDING THE TIMING OF FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRIA LOSSES, THE

STANDARDS FOR OBTAINING THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT AND THE MECHANISMS FOR

ALLOCATING LOSSES EXCEEDING INSURERS DEDUCTIBLES. WE CURRENTLY HAVE PROPERTY

REINSURANCE THAT WOULD COVER ONLY A PORTION OF OUR DEDUCTIBLE. IN APRIL 2003,

WE RENEWED OUR TERRORISM REINSURANCE COVERAGE, AS DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE TRIA WILL ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE OF

CREATING A VIABLE PRIVATE INSURANCE MARKET FOR TERRORISM COVERAGE PRIOR TO TRIAS

EXPIRATION, AND RATES AND FORMS USED BY US AND OUR COMPETITORS MAY VARY WIDELY

IN THE FUTURE.

REGARDLESS OF TRIA, SOME

STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS DO NOT PERMIT TERRORISM EXCLUSIONS IN VARIOUS

COVERAGES WE WRITE, AND CURRENTLY, WE HAVE NOT EXCLUDED COVERAGE FOR TERRORIST

ACTS BY DOMESTIC TERRORISTS (E.G., THE OKLAHOMA BOMBING) IN OUR DOMESTIC

COVERAGES, OR RESULTING FROM TERRORIST ACTS OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL COVERAGES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSSES FROM

TERRORIST ACTS IS NOT LIMITED TO TRIA COVERAGES. LOSSES FROM TERRORISTS ACTS,

WHETHER ARISING UNDER TRIA COVERAGES OR OTHERWISE, COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

PURCHASE OF

TERRORISM COVERAGE AND EXPOSURE TO FUTURE TERRORIST EVENTS

AFTER THE TERRORIST

ATTACKS IN SEPTEMBER 2001, REINSURERS, IN GENERAL, SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED

TERRORISM COVERAGE FROM PROPERTY REINSURANCE TREATIES THAT SUBSEQUENTLY RENEWED.

AS A RESULT, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, WE PURCHASED LIMITED SPECIFIC

TERRORISM COVERAGE IN THE FORM OF TWO SEPARATE PROPERTY REINSURANCE TREATIES. THOSE

TREATIES EXPIRED ON APRIL 1, 2003, ON WHICH DATE WE RENEWED OUR COVERAGE

IN THE FORM OF A COMBINED PER-RISK AND CATASTROPHE TERRORISM OCCURRENCE TREATY.

THE TREATY PROVIDES BOTH CERTIFIED AND NON-CERTIFIED TRIA COVERAGE. (TO BE TRIA

CERTIFIED, THE TERRORIST ACT MUST BE SPONSORED BY AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP OR

STATE AND DAMAGE CAUSED MUST EXCEED A FINANCIAL THRESHOLD, WHEREAS

NON-CERTIFIED COVERAGE REFERS TO ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM). IN ADDITION, WE

SECURED NON-CERTIFIED TRIA TERRORISM COVERAGE IN OUR STANDARD PROPERTY

REINSURANCE TREATY RENEWALS IN APRIL 2003 AS PART OF OUR OVERALL CEDED

REINSURANCE PROGRAM. WE RENEWED THE MAJORITY OF OUR REINSURANCE TREATIES

COVERING WORKERS

18

COMPENSATION

IN JULY 2003, AND THE MAJORITY OF TREATIES COVERING GENERAL LIABILITY

BUSINESS IN AUGUST 2003; THOSE RENEWALS INCLUDED BOTH CERTIFIED AND

NON-CERTIFIED TRIA COVERAGE. GENERALLY, OUR REINSURANCE TREATIES DO NOT COVER

ACTS OF TERRORISM INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL OR CHEMICAL EVENTS. THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE TERRORISM REINSURANCE COVERAGE

ON EXPIRING TREATIES EACH YEAR.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INVESTMENT OPERATIONS SEGMENT

OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVES THE OVERALL INVESTMENT

PLAN FOR THE COMPANIES WITHIN THE ST. PAULS PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONS. EACH

SUBSIDIARY DEVELOPS ITS OWN SPECIFIC INVESTMENT POLICY TAILORED TO COMPLY WITH

DOMESTIC LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE OVERALL CORPORATE INVESTMENT PLAN. THE

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THOSE PLANS ARE TO ENSURE OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR

LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF INSURANCE CLAIM PAYMENTS, AND, HAVING DONE

THAT, TO INCREASE OUR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE FUNDS WE INVEST ARE GENERATED

BY UNDERWRITING CASH FLOWS, CONSISTING OF THE PREMIUMS COLLECTED LESS LOSSES

AND EXPENSES PAID, AND BY INVESTMENT CASH FLOWS, CONSISTING OF INCOME RECEIVED

ON EXISTING INVESTMENTS AND PROCEEDS FROM SALES, REDEMPTIONS AND MATURITIES OF

INVESTMENTS.

THE MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE

DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY, INTERMEDIATE-TERM

TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, CORPORATE AND MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS, AND TAX-EXEMPT

U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS. WE ALSO INVEST MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES,

VENTURE CAPITAL AND REAL ESTATE. THE LATTER THREE INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE

POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT ALSO INVOLVE VARYING DEGREES OF RISK,

INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND LESS LIQUIDITY.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ON

EACH OF OUR INVESTED ASSET CLASSES.

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES.

OUR PORTFOLIO OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES CONSTITUTED

71% (AT COST) OF OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OPERATIONS INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF

HIGH-QUALITY, INTERMEDIATE-TERM TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, CORPORATE AND

MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS, AND TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

PRESENTS INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO FOR THE YEARS 2001

WE PARTICIPATE IN A SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM WHEREBY

CERTAIN SECURITIES FROM OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE LOANED TO OTHER

INSTITUTIONS. WE REQUIRE COLLATERAL EQUAL TO 102 PERCENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE LOANED SECURITIES. WE MAINTAIN FULL OWNERSHIP RIGHTS TO THE SECURITIES LOANED,

AND CONTINUE TO EARN INTEREST ON THEM. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELL

THE SECURITIES WHILE THEY ARE ON LOAN. WE HAVE AN INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

WITH THE LENDING AGENTS IN THE EVENT A BORROWER BECOMES INSOLVENT OR FAILS TO

RETURN SECURITIES. WE RECORD SECURITIES LENDING COLLATERAL AS A LIABILITY AND

PAY THE BORROWER AN AGREED UPON INTEREST RATE. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE COLLATERAL

ARE INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND ARE REPORTED AS SECURITIES ON LOAN

ON THE BALANCE SHEET. WE SHARE A PORTION OF THE INTEREST EARNED ON THESE

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH THE LENDING AGENT. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES

ON LOAN IS REMOVED FROM FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND SHOWN

AS A SEPARATE INVESTMENT ASSET.

WE MANAGE OUR BOND PORTFOLIO CONSERVATIVELY TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE RETURNS WHILE LIMITING EXPOSURE TO RISKS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003,

APPROXIMATELY 96% OF OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO (COMPRISED OF FIXED INCOME

SECURITIES, THE FIXED INCOME PORTION OF OUR SECURITIES ON LOAN AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS),

WAS RATED INVESTMENT GRADE. APPROXIMATELY 3% CONSISTED OF NON-INVESTMENT GRADE

SECURITIES AND 1% WERE NON-RATED SECURITIES.

19

REAL

ESTATE AND MORTGAGE LOANS.

OUR REAL ESTATE

HOLDINGS CONSIST OF A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND WAREHOUSE

PROPERTIES THAT WE OWN DIRECTLY OR HAVE PARTIAL INTEREST IN THROUGH JOINT

VENTURES. THE PROPERTIES ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

STATES AND HAD AN OVERALL OCCUPANCY RATE OF 89.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. WE

ALSO HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE LOANS ACQUIRED IN OUR MERGER WITH

USF&G CORPORATION IN 1998. THE REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO

PRODUCED $67 MILLION OF PRETAX INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2003 AND GENERATED $4

MILLION OF PRETAX REALIZED GAINS.

VENTURE

CAPITAL.

SECURITIES OF SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED

COMPANIES SPANNING A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES COMPRISE OUR VENTURE CAPITAL

HOLDINGS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 2% OF PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS (AT COST) AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE $535 MILLION CARRYING VALUE OF VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 INCLUDED $24 MILLION OF PRETAX UNREALIZED

APPRECIATION. VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS GENERATED PRETAX REALIZED INVESTMENT

GAINS OF$51 MILLION IN 2003 AND

LOSSES OF $200 MILLION IN 2002.

IN OUR VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO, THE SALE OF A LARGE

PORTION OF ONE OF OUR INVESTMENT HOLDINGS GENERATED A PRETAX GAIN OF $171

MILLION IN 2003, WHICH WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY IMPAIRMENT REALIZED LOSSES

TOTALING $143 MILLION RELATED TO 38 OF OUR INVESTMENT HOLDINGS. FOURTEEN OF

THOSE HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO A MERGER OR SALE AT A VALUE LESS THAN OUR

COST. ELEVEN HOLDINGS EXPERIENCED FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC DETERIORATION

(CHARACTERIZED BY GROSS MARGINS BEING LESS THAN EXPECTED, PRODUCT PRICING NOT

MEETING INITIAL PROJECTIONS DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS, AND GREATER THAN EXPECTED

MANUFACTURING EXPENSES). SIX HOLDINGS WERE WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE THE ENTITIES

PROGRESS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN PLANNED AND ADDITIONAL FINANCING WAS

REQUIRED AT VALUES LESS THAN OUR COST. AN ADDITIONAL SIX HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED

DUE TO CESSATION OF OPERATIONS OF THE ENTITY. FINALLY, ONE HOLDING WAS IMPAIRED

BECAUSE MARKET DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCT WAS LESS THAN EXPECTED.

IN 2002, REALIZED LOSSES IN OUR VENTURE CAPITAL

PORTFOLIO INCLUDED $56 MILLION OF LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF THE

MAJORITY OF OUR PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENT HOLDINGS, AND IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS IN

25 OF OUR HOLDINGS TOTALING $122 MILLION. THESE HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED FOR THE

SAME GENERAL REASONS NOTED ABOVE FOR THE 2003 IMPAIRMENTS: SEVEN HOLDINGS WERE

IMPAIRED BECAUSE MARKET DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS WAS LESS THAN EXPECTED; SEVEN

HOLDINGS WERE WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE THE ENTITIES PROGRESS WAS LESS THAN PLANNED

AND ADDITIONAL FINANCING WOULD BE REQUIRED; FIVE HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO

FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC DETERIORATION (AS DEFINED ABOVE); FOUR HOLDINGS WERE

IMPAIRED DUE TO A MERGER OR SALE AT LESS THAN OUR COST; AND TWO HOLDINGS WERE

IMPAIRED DUE TO CESSATION OF OPERATIONS.

EQUITIES.

OUR

EQUITY HOLDINGS CONSIST OF A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF PUBLIC COMMON STOCK,

COMPRISING LESS THAN 1% OF TOTAL PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS (AT COST) AT

YEAR-END 2003. IN MID-2002, WE BEGAN REDUCING OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS. OUR

DECISION TO REDUCE OUR PUBLIC EQUITY HOLDINGS WAS PROMPTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING OUR OPINION AS TO THE NEAR-TERM DIRECTION OF EQUITY PRICES, A

COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF OUR AGGREGATE EQUITY EXPOSURE (INCLUDING VENTURE

CAPITAL AND EQUITIES HELD BY OUR PENSION FUND), AND A CHANGE IN OUR OPINION AS

TO THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLICLY HELD

INSURANCE COMPANIES IN LIGHT OF INCREASING EQUITY MARKET VOLATILITY. BY THE END

OF 2003, WE HAD REDUCED OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS BY $953 MILLION (AT COST) SINCE

YEAR-END 2001.

SHORT-TERM

AND OTHER INVESTMENTS.

OUR

PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDES SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS

INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING OUR 14% EQUITY OWNERSHIP STAKE IN PLATINUM AND OUR

WARRANTS TO PURCHASE UP TO SIX MILLION ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES OF PLATINUM),

WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE COMPRISED 15% OF PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31,

2003. ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002

WAS A LONG-TERM INTEREST-BEARING SECURITY FROM A HIGHLY RATED ENTITY,

SUPPORTING A SERIES OF INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT

SECURITY ON THOSE DATES WAS $359 MILLION AND $386 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

DERIVATIVES.

OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT OPERATIONS HAVE HAD

LIMITED INVOLVEMENT WITH DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY FOR

PURPOSES OF HEDGING AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND

INTEREST RATES. EFFECTIVE JANUARY. 1, 2001, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED, WHICH REQUIRED THE

RECOGNITION OF ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ON

THE BALANCE SHEET. SEE NOTE 7 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM

8 OF THIS REPORT, WHICH PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPACT OF

COMPETITION

PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURANCE

THE PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE IN THE AREAS OF PRICE, SERVICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, TECHNOLOGY AND

AGENT RELATIONSHIPS. RATINGS ISSUED BY INDEPENDENT RATINGS AGENCIES ARE ALSO A

COMPETITIVE FACTOR IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS. INCREASING THE COMPETITIVE

PRESSURE IS THE CURRENT LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS IMPACTING

INVESTMENT RETURNS AND MAKING UNDERWRITING DECISIONS EVEN MORE CRITICAL. OUR

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE WITH OTHER STOCK

COMPANIES, MUTUAL COMPANIES, ALTERNATIVE RISK SHARING GROUPS AND OTHER

UNDERWRITING ORGANIZATIONS. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE COMPANIES WILLING TO WRITE MOST CLASSES OF

BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND PRICING AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT,

REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMPANIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED NICHE PROGRAMS

FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, MANY LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS SELF-INSURE

THEIR RISKS OR UTILIZE LARGE DEDUCTIBLES ON PURCHASED INSURANCE. THERE ARE

APPROXIMATELY 3,400 PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE UNITED

STATES OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY OR IN GROUPS, AND NO SINGLE COMPANY OR GROUP IS

DOMINANT. ACCORDING TO A.M. BEST, WE ARE THE SIXTH-LARGEST UNITED

STATES COMMERCIAL LINES PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE GROUP BASED ON 2002

DIRECT PREMIUMS WRITTEN. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE LARGER AND HAVE GREATER

ACCESS TO CAPITAL. IN VARIOUS MARKETS, WE ALSO COMPETE BASED ON RATINGS AND

SEVERAL OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE MORE HIGHLY RATED.

IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN

GENERAL CONTINUES TO BE AFFECTED BY AN INTENSIFYING COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AS

DEMONSTRATED BY CONSOLIDATION THROUGH MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND COMPETITION

FROM NEW ENTRANTS, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES,

INCLUDING THE INTERNET, TO ESTABLISH OR EXPAND THEIR BUSINESSES. THE

GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT, PASSED IN 1999, WHICH REPEALED U.S. LAWS THAT SEPARATED

COMMERCIAL BANKING, INVESTMENT BANKING AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES, TOGETHER WITH

CHANGES TO THE INDUSTRY RESULTING FROM PREVIOUS REFORMS, HAS INCREASED THE

NUMBER OF COMPANIES COMPETING FOR A SIMILAR CUSTOMER BASE.

OUR COMPETITORS IN THE SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL AND

COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENTS INCLUDE AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, THE CHUBB

CORPORATION, CNA FINANCIAL CORPORATION, HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, SAFECO

CORPORATION AND TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP.

OUR COMPETITORS IN THE SURETY & CONSTRUCTION

SEGMENT INCLUDE CNA SURETY CORPORATION, AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, TRAVELERS

PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., AND ZURICH NORTH AMERICA. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL AND

LLOYDS SEGMENT, OUR INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTIES COMPETE WITH NUMEROUS INSURERS

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND IRELAND WHILE COMPETITORS IN LLOYDS MARKETS

IN WHICH WE ARE ACTIVE INCLUDE VARIOUS INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER MEMBERS OF

LLOYDS.

OUR SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE

PRINCIPALLY BY ATTEMPTING TO OFFER A COMBINATION OF SUPERIOR PRODUCTS,

UNDERWRITING EXPERTISE AND SERVICES AT A COMPETITIVE, YET PROFITABLE, PRICE. ADDITIONALLY,

OUR RELATIVELY LARGE SIZE AND UNDERWRITING CAPACITY PROVIDE US WITH

OPPORTUNITIES NOT AVAILABLE TO SMALLER COMPANIES.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL

COMPETITION IN ALL ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES THAT

DISTRIBUTE NUVEEN INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ALSO DISTRIBUTE NUMEROUS

COMPETING PRODUCTS, OFTEN INCLUDING PRODUCTS SPONSORED BY THE RETAIL

DISTRIBUTION FIRMS WHERE THEY ARE EMPLOYED. THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW BARRIERS

TO ENTRY FOR NEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS MANAGED

ACCOUNT BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM OTHER

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS SEEKING TO BE APPROVED AS MANAGERS IN THE VARIOUS WRAP-FEE

PROGRAMS. THE SPONSOR FIRMS HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF APPROVED MANAGERS AT THE

HIGHEST AND MOST ATTRACTIVE LEVELS OF THEIR PROGRAMS AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ASPECTS OF SUCH FIRMS ON AN

ON-GOING BASIS AS THEY EVALUATE WHICH FIRMS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CONTINUED

PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS.

22

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS IS ALSO

SUBJECT TO COMPETITION IN OBTAINING THE COMMITMENT OF UNDERWRITERS TO

UNDERWRITE ITS EXCHANGE TRADED FUND OFFERINGS. TO THE EXTENT THE INCREASED

COMPETITION FOR UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION CAUSES HIGHER DISTRIBUTION COSTS,

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET REVENUE AND EARNINGS WILL BE REDUCED.

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ARE

SOLD TO THE PUBLIC BY BROKER/DEALERS, BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHERS,

AND MANY COMPETING INVESTMENT PRODUCT SPONSORS OFFER A BROADER ARRAY OF

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS. MANY OF THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER

RESOURCES THAN NUVEEN. IN ADDITION, CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE RECENT BEAR MARKET ENVIRONMENT ARE ALTERING THE

LANDSCAPE IN WHICH NUVEEN INVESTMENTS DISTRIBUTORS COMPETE AND THE ECONOMICS

OF MANY OF THE PRODUCTS THEY OFFER. THE EFFECT THAT THESE CONTINUING CHANGES IN

THE BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRIES WILL HAVE ON NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS AND ITS COMPETITORS CANNOT BE PREDICTED. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

COMPETES WITH OTHER PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF THE RANGE

OF PRODUCTS OFFERED, THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF SUCH PRODUCTS, QUALITY OF

SERVICE, FEES CHARGED, THE LEVEL AND TYPE OF BROKER COMPENSATION, THE MANNER IN

WHICH SUCH PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED AND DISTRIBUTED, AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO

REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES AND INVESTORS.

REGULATION

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION.

THE

ST. PAUL AND OUR DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION AS

AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM IN STATES WHERE OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

ARE DOMICILED, WHICH CURRENTLY INCLUDE MINNESOTA, MARYLAND, WISCONSIN,

MISSISSIPPI, IOWA, ILLINOIS, CALIFORNIA, DELAWARE, INDIANA, VERMONT AND NEW

YORK. SUCH REGULATION GENERALLY PROVIDES THAT TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN COMPANIES

WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM MUST BE FAIR AND EQUITABLE. TRANSFERS OF

ASSETS AMONG SUCH AFFILIATED COMPANIES, CERTAIN DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FROM

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN COMPANIES

WITHIN THE SYSTEM MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRIOR NOTICE TO, OR PRIOR APPROVAL BY,

STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. SUCH REGULATIONS ALSO REQUIRE THE INSURANCE

HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY TO REGISTER WITH THE INSURANCE

DEPARTMENT IN THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARYS STATE OF DOMICILE AND TO FURNISH

ANNUALLY FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPERATIONS OF COMPANIES

WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM.

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

FIRE AND MARINE IS OUR LEAD U.S.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY, AND ITS DIVIDEND PAYING CAPACITY IS

REGULATED BY THE LAWS OF MINNESOTA, ITS STATE OF DOMICILE. MINNESOTA INSURANCE

LAW PROVIDES THAT, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS OR

DISTRIBUTIONS, ALL DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS PAID BY FIRE AND MARINE MAY BE

DECLARED OR PAID ONLY FROM EARNED SURPLUS, OR UNASSIGNED FUNDS, AS DETERMINED

PURSUANT TO STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, FIRE

AND MARINES EARNED SURPLUS WAS $2.2 BILLION. FIRE AND MARINE ALSO MUST NOTIFY

THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE REGULATOR OF ITS INTENT TO PAY A DIVIDEND IF THE

DIVIDEND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE

PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, WOULD EXCEED A SPECIFIED STATUTORY LIMIT, AND MAY NOT

PAY SUCH DIVIDEND UNTIL EITHER 30 DAYS AFTER THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE REGULATOR

HAS RECEIVED NOTICE OF IT AND HAS NOT WITHIN THAT PERIOD DISAPPROVED IT, OR THE

REGULATOR HAS APPROVED THE PAYMENT. THE CURRENT STATUTORY LIMITATION APPLICABLE

TO MINNESOTA PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURERS GENERALLY IS THE GREATER OF.

(1)

10% OF SUCH INSURERS

SURPLUS AS REGARDS POLICYHOLDERS AS OF THE DECEMBER 31 NEXT PRECEDING THE

DATE OF THE PROPOSED DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION; OR

(2)

THE NET INCOME OF SUCH

INSURER, NOT INCLUDING REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS, FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD

ENDING THE DECEMBER 31 NEXT PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE PROPOSED DIVIDEND OR

DISTRIBUTION,

IN EACH CASE DETERMINED

UNDER STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DIFFER

FROM GAAP PRIMARILY IN RELATION TO DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS, DEFERRED

TAXES AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS,

23

AND RESERVE CALCULATION

ASSUMPTIONS. THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE REGULATOR IS ALSO REQUIRED TO REVIEW AT

LEAST ANNUALLY THE DIVIDENDS PAID BY A MINNESOTA DOMESTIC INSURER TO DETERMINE

IF THE DIVIDENDS ARE REASONABLE BASED UPON (1) THE ADEQUACY OF SURPLUS AS

REGARDS POLICYHOLDERS REMAINING AFTER THE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND (2) THE

QUALITY OF THE INSURERS EARNINGS AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE REQUIRED EARNINGS

INCLUDE EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS.

OTHER STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS HAVE SIMILAR

REGULATIONS TO THOSE OF MINNESOTA THAT AFFECT THE ABILITY OF OUR OTHER

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, MOST OF WHICH ARE SUBSIDIARIES OF FIRE AND MARINE, TO

PAY DIVIDENDS. THE LAWS REGULATING DIVIDENDS OF THE OTHER STATES AND FOREIGN

JURISDICTIONS WHERE OUR OTHER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED ARE SIMILAR,

BUT NOT IDENTICAL, TO MINNESOTAS, AND MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE. IN ADDITION,

MANY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE HELD BY OTHER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES,

AND ONLY INDIRECTLY BY US. THEREFORE, THE ABILITY OF THESE INDIRECTLY-HELD

SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR DIRECT PARENTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO

RECEIVE THESE DIVIDENDS FROM THOSE INTERMEDIATE SUBSIDIARIES, WILL BE SUBJECT

TO THE RESPECTIVE ABILITY OF ALL SUCH SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET FINANCIAL AND

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THEM.

APPROXIMATELY $774 MILLION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US

FROM PAYMENT OF ORDINARY DIVIDENDS BY FIRE AND MARINE IN 2004. ANY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS

BEYOND THE $774 MILLION LIMITATION ARE SUBJECT TO PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE

MINNESOTA COMMISSIONER OF COMMERCE. BUSINESS AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS MAY

IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS ACTUALLY PAID. IN 2003, WE RECEIVED DIVIDENDS IN

THE FORM OF CASH AND SECURITIES TOTALING $625 MILLION FROM OUR U.S.

UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES. WE RECEIVED NO CASH DIVIDENDS FROM OUR U.S.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES IN 2002. IN 2001, WE RECEIVED

DIVIDENDS IN THE FORM OF CASH AND SECURITIES OF $827 MILLION FROM FIRE AND

MARINE.

CHANGE

OF CONTROL.

MOST

STATES, INCLUDING THE STATES IN WHICH OUR DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

DOMICILED, HAVE INSURANCE LAWS THAT REQUIRE REGULATORY APPROVAL OF A CHANGE OF

CONTROL OF AN INSURER OR AN INSURERS HOLDING COMPANY. LAWS SUCH AS THESE THAT

APPLY TO US PREVENT ANY PERSON FROM ACQUIRING CONTROL OF THE ST. PAUL OR OF OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THAT PERSON HAS FILED A STATEMENT WITH SPECIFIED

INFORMATION WITH THE INSURANCE REGULATORS AND HAS OBTAINED THEIR PRIOR APPROVAL.

UNDER MOST STATES STATUTES, ACQUIRING 10% OR MORE OF THE VOTING STOCK OF AN

INSURANCE COMPANY OR ITS PARENT COMPANY IS PRESUMPTIVELY CONSIDERED A CHANGE OF

CONTROL, ALTHOUGH SUCH PRESUMPTION MAY BE REBUTTED. ACCORDINGLY, ANY PERSON WHO

ACQUIRES 10% OR MORE OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF THE ST. PAUL WITHOUT THE PRIOR

APPROVAL OF THE INSURANCE REGULATORS OF THE STATES IN WHICH OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED WILL BE IN VIOLATION OF THESE STATES LAWS AND MAY

BE SUBJECT TO INJUNCTIVE ACTION REQUIRING THE DISPOSITION OR SEIZURE OF THOSE

SECURITIES BY THE RELEVANT INSURANCE REGULATOR OR PROHIBITING THE VOTING OF

THOSE SECURITIES AND TO OTHER ACTIONS DETERMINED BY THE RELEVANT INSURANCE

REGULATOR.

IN ADDITION, MANY STATE INSURANCE LAWS REQUIRE PRIOR

NOTIFICATION OF STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF A

NON-DOMICILIARY INSURANCE COMPANY DOING BUSINESS IN THAT STATE. WHILE THESE

PRE-NOTIFICATION STATUTES DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS TO

DISAPPROVE THE CHANGE IN CONTROL, THEY AUTHORIZE REGULATORY ACTION IN THE

AFFECTED STATE IF PARTICULAR CONDITIONS EXIST SUCH AS UNDUE MARKET

CONCENTRATION. ANY FUTURE TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN

CONTROL OF THE ST. PAUL MAY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTIFICATION IN THOSE STATES THAT

HAVE ADOPTED PRE-ACQUISITION NOTIFICATION LAWS.

CHANGE OF CONTROL LAWS MAY DISCOURAGE POTENTIAL

ACQUISITION PROPOSALS AND MAY DELAY, DETER OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF

THE ST. PAUL, INCLUDING THROUGH TRANSACTIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR UNSOLICITED

TRANSACTIONS, THAT SOME OR ALL OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT CONSIDER TO BE

DESIRABLE.

STATE

REGULATION OF INSURANCE OPERATIONS.

OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

SUBJECT TO LICENSING AND SUPERVISION BY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS. THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF SUCH

REGULATION VARY BUT GENERALLY HAVE THEIR SOURCE IN STATUTES THAT DELEGATE REGULATORY,

SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS TO INSURANCE REGULATORS, WHICH IN THE

U.S. ARE STATE AUTHORITIES. SUCH REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION OF

THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES MAY RELATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO

24

THE STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY

WHICH MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED; THE LICENSING OF INSURERS AND THEIR AGENTS;

THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS; RESTRICTIONS ON THE SIZE OF RISK

WHICH MAY BE INSURED UNDER A SINGLE POLICY; DEPOSITS OF SECURITIES FOR THE

BENEFIT OF POLICYHOLDERS; REGULATION OF POLICY FORMS AND PREMIUM RATES;

PERIODIC EXAMINATION OF THE AFFAIRS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES; ANNUAL AND OTHER

REPORTS REQUIRED TO BE FILED ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INSURERS OR FOR

OTHER PURPOSES; REQUIREMENTS REGARDING RESERVES FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS, LOSSES

AND OTHER MATTERS; THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS TO POLICYHOLDERS

AND SHAREHOLDERS; THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF REQUIRED PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE

GUARANTY FUNDS; AND THE INVOLUNTARY ASSUMPTION OF HARD-TO-PLACE OR HIGH-RISK INSURANCE

BUSINESS, PRIMARILY IN WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE LINES.

LOSS RATIO TRENDS IN PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE

UNDERWRITING EXPERIENCE MAY BE IMPROVED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGING THE

KINDS OF COVERAGES PROVIDED BY POLICIES, PROVIDING LOSS PREVENTION AND RISK

MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INCREASING PREMIUM RATES, PURCHASING REINSURANCE OR BY A

COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET

EMERGING ADVERSE UNDERWRITING TRENDS MAY BE DELAYED, FROM TIME TO TIME, BY THE

EFFECTS OF LAWS WHICH REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL BY INSURANCE REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES OF CHANGES IN POLICY FORMS AND PREMIUM RATES. OUR U.S. UNDERWRITING

OPERATIONS DO BUSINESS IN ALL 50 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO

RICO, GUAM AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. A NUMBER OF THESE JURISDICTIONS REQUIRE

PRIOR APPROVAL OF MOST OR ALL PREMIUM RATES.

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

IN

ORDER TO ENHANCE THE REGULATION OF INSURER SOLVENCY, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (THE NAIC) HAS ADOPTED A FORMULA AND MODEL LAW TO

IMPLEMENT RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC) REQUIREMENTS FOR MOST PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE MINIMUM CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS AND TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION THAT STATUTORY SURPLUS

PROVIDES FOR POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS. THE RBC FORMULA FOR PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES MEASURES THREE MAJOR AREAS OF RISK FACING PROPERTY

AND CASUALTY INSURERS: UNDERWRITING, WHICH ENCOMPASSES THE RISK OF ADVERSE LOSS

DEVELOPMENTS AND INADEQUATE PRICING; DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES ARISING FROM

MARKET AND/OR CREDIT RISK; AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK ARISING FROM ADVERSE EXPERIENCE

FROM NON-CONTROLLED ASSETS, GUARANTEES FOR AFFILIATES OR OTHER CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES AND EXCESSIVE PREMIUM GROWTH.

UNDER LAWS ADOPTED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES, INSURERS

HAVING LESS TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL THAN THAT REQUIRED BY THE RBC CALCULATION

WILL BE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL

OF CAPITAL INADEQUACY. THE RBC RATIOS FOR EACH OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

CURRENTLY ARE ABOVE THE RANGES THAT WOULD REQUIRE ANY REGULATORY OR CORRECTIVE

ACTION.

IRIS TESTS.

THE NAIC HAS DEVELOPED A SET

OF FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OR TESTS KNOWN AS THE INSURANCE REGULATORY

INFORMATION SYSTEM TO ASSIST STATE REGULATORS IN MONITORING THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND IDENTIFYING COMPANIES THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL

ATTENTION OR ACTION BY INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. INSURANCE COMPANIES

GENERALLY SUBMIT DATA ANNUALLY TO THE NAIC, WHICH IN TURN ANALYZES THE DATA

USING PRESCRIBED FINANCIAL DATA RATIOS, EACH WITH DEFINED USUAL RANGES.  GENERALLY, REGULATORS WILL BEGIN TO

INVESTIGATE OR MONITOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY IF ITS RATIOS FALL OUTSIDE THE

USUAL RANGES FOR FOUR OR MORE OF THE RATIOS. IF AN INSURANCE COMPANY HAS

INSUFFICIENT CAPITAL, REGULATORS MAY ACT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE IT

CAN ISSUE. WE ARE NOT AWARE THAT ANY OF OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY

SUBJECT TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY BASED ON THESE RATIOS.

INSURANCE RESERVES.

STATE AND PROVINCIAL

INSURANCE LAWS REQUIRE US TO ANALYZE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVES ANNUALLY. OUR

ACTUARIES MUST SUBMIT AN OPINION THAT OUR RESERVES, WHEN CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF

THE ASSETS WE HOLD WITH RESPECT TO THOSE RESERVES, MAKE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR

OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED EXPENSES.

SHARED MARKET AND SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS.

STATE INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

REQUIRE US TO PARTICIPATE IN MANDATORY PROPERTY-LIABILITY SHARED MARKET, POOLING

OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS THAT PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUALS OR

OTHERS WHO OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE COVERAGE

25

VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED BY PRIVATE INSURERS. SHARED MARKET MECHANISMS

INCLUDE ASSIGNED RISK PLANS; FAIR ACCESS TO INSURANCE REQUIREMENT OR FAIR

PLANS; AND REINSURANCE FACILITIES FOR COVERING CATASTROPHIC RISK. IN ADDITION,

SOME STATES REQUIRE INSURERS TO PARTICIPATE IN REINSURANCE POOLS FOR CLAIMS

THAT EXCEED SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. OUR PARTICIPATION IN THESE MANDATORY SHARED

MARKET OR POOLING MECHANISMS GENERALLY IS RELATED TO THE AMOUNTS OF OUR DIRECT

WRITINGS FOR THE TYPE OF COVERAGE WRITTEN BY THE SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENT IN THE

APPLICABLE STATE. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF OUR PARTICIPATION

IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS.

INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION ASSESSMENTS.

EACH STATE HAS INSURANCE

GUARANTY ASSOCIATION LAWS UNDER WHICH LIFE AND PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS

DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE MAY BE ASSESSED BY STATE INSURANCE GUARANTY

ASSOCIATIONS FOR CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF INSOLVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES TO POLICYHOLDERS

AND CLAIMANTS. TYPICALLY, STATES ASSESS EACH MEMBER INSURER IN AN AMOUNT

RELATED TO THE MEMBER INSURERS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE BUSINESS WRITTEN BY

ALL MEMBER INSURERS IN THE STATE. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003

AND 2002, WE INCURRED NET EXPENSE OF $10 MILLION AND $13 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

PURSUANT TO STATE INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION LAWS. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT

THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF ANY FUTURE ASSESSMENTS ON OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES

UNDER THESE LAWS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED RESERVES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE FOR

ASSESSMENTS RELATING TO INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO

INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS.

FEDERAL

REGULATION OF INSURANCE OPERATIONS.

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, PRESIDENT

BUSH SIGNED INTO LAW THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002, OR TRIA.  A DISCUSSION OF TRIAS PRINCIPAL PROVISIONS

CAN BE FOUND IN THE TERRORISM RISK AND LEGISLATION SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

OUR DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

TRIA, ALTHOUGH TRIA DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL OF THE COVERAGES THEY WRITE. TRIA

DOES APPLY TO MOST OF OUR COVERAGES WRITTEN, INCLUDING PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL, FIRE, OCEAN MARINE, INLAND MARINE, LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL AUTO,

AIRCRAFT, SURETY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION.

INTERNATIONAL

REGULATION OF INSURANCE OPERATIONS.

OUR INSURANCE UNDERWRITING

OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE REGULATED BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

AUTHORITY (FSA). THE FSAS PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES ARE TO MAINTAIN MARKET

CONFIDENCE, PROMOTE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, PROTECT CONSUMERS,

AND TO FIGHT FINANCIAL CRIME. IN CANADA, THE CONDUCT OF INSURANCE BUSINESS IS

REGULATED UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT OF 1992, WHICH

REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVELS OF CAPITAL DEPENDING ON

THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSURANCE POLICIES IN FORCE. THE LLOYDS OPERATION IS

ALSO REGULATED BY THE FSA, WHICH HAS DELEGATED CERTAIN REGULATORY

RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE COUNCIL OF LLOYDS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS

IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE UNDERWRITE INSURANCE

BUSINESS. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR PLANS TO CEASE UNDERWRITING

OPERATIONS IN SELECTED FOREIGN COUNTRIES WERE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL IN

SEVERAL OF THOSE COUNTRIES.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

ONE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS SUBSIDIARIES IS REGISTERED

AS A BROKER/DEALER UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND IS SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE COMMISSION), NASD

REGULATION, INC. AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND SELF-REGULATORY

ORGANIZATIONS. THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY REGULATED IN

THE UNITED STATES, AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN

RESULT IN THE REVOCATION OF BROKER/DEALER LICENSES, THE IMPOSITION OF CENSURES

OR FINES, AND THE SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A FIRM AND/OR ITS EMPLOYEES FROM

THE SECURITIES BUSINESS.

26

EACH OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT ADVISER

SUBSIDIARIES IS REGISTERED WITH THE COMMISSION UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS

ACT. VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

BUSINESS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO BENEFIT THE INVESTMENT PRODUCT

HOLDER AND GENERALLY GRANT SUPERVISORY AGENCIES AND BODIES BROAD ADMINISTRATIVE

POWERS, INCLUDING THE POWER TO LIMIT OR RESTRICT NUVEEN FROM CARRYING ON ITS

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS IN THE EVENT THAT IT FAILS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN SUCH EVENT, THE POSSIBLE SANCTIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED

INCLUDE THE SUSPENSION OF INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, LIMITATIONS ON NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS ENGAGING IN THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS FOR SPECIFIED

PERIODS OF TIME, THE REVOCATION OF ITS ADVISORY SUBSIDIARIES REGISTRATIONS AS

INVESTMENT ADVISERS OR OTHER CENSURES AND FINES.

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS HAS

RESPONDED AND CONTINUES TO RESPOND TO VARIOUS REQUESTS AND INQUIRIES FROM

REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS THAT ARE RELATED TO RECENT

WELL-PUBLICIZED ALLEGED INCIDENTS OF INAPPROPRIATE AND ILLEGAL TRADING WITHIN

THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY. THESE INCIDENTS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED

REGULATION OF ALL ASSET MANAGERS, INCLUDING NUVEEN INVESTMENTS. SUCH REGULATION

COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON NUVEEN INVESTMENTS PROFITABILITY.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

FIRE AND MARINE OWNS OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS

BUILDINGS, LOCATED AT 385 WASHINGTON STREET AND 130 WEST SIXTH STREET, ST.

PAUL, MN. THESE BUILDINGS ARE ADJACENT TO ONE ANOTHER AND CONSIST OF

APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GROSS FLOOR SPACE. FIRE AND MARINE

ALSO OWNS PROPERTY IN WOODBURY, MN WHERE ITS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES BUILDING

AND OFF-SITE COMPUTER PROCESSING OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED.

WE OWN A BUILDING IN LONDON, ENGLAND, WHICH HOUSES A

PORTION OF OUR U.K. OPERATIONS. WE RETAINED OWNERSHIP OF ANOTHER BUILDING IN

LONDON SUBSEQUENT TO THE SALE OF MINET HOLDINGS PLC TO AON CORPORATION IN 1997,

WHICH IS BEING LEASED TO AN OUTSIDE PARTY. IN A TRANSACTION COMPLETED IN MARCH 2001,

WE SOLD A 50% INTEREST IN THIS BUILDING. IN APRIL 2003, WE COMPLETED THE

SALE OF OUR 68-ACRE OFFICE CAMPUS IN BALTIMORE, MD THAT WE ACQUIRED AS PART OF

OUR MERGER WITH USF&G CORPORATION IN 1998. AS PART OF THE SALE AGREEMENT,

WE AGREED TO LEASE A PORTION OF THE OFFICE SPACE ON THE CAMPUS UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2004.

IN AUGUST 2003, WE SOLD A PARKING RAMP WE OWNED IN DOWNTOWN ST. PAUL, MN

FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION.

FIRE AND MARINE AND ITS SUBSIDIARY, ST. PAUL

PROPERTIES, INC., OWN A PORTFOLIO OF INCOME-PRODUCING PROPERTIES IN

VARIOUS LOCATIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT THEY HAVE PURCHASED FOR

INVESTMENT. INCLUDED IN THIS PORTFOLIO ARE FOUR OFFICE BUILDINGS IN WHICH WE

HOLD A 50% OWNERSHIP INTEREST LOCATED ON MANHATTAN ISLAND IN NEW YORK, NY WHICH

COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES RENT OR LEASE OFFICE SPACE

IN MOST CITIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE

CURRENTLY OWNED AND LEASED OFFICE FACILITIES OF THE ST. PAUL AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES ADEQUATE FOR THE CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE LEVEL OF

OPERATIONS.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

LEGAL MATTERS



IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS, WE (AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES) HAVE BEEN

NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS LAWSUITS. SOME OF THESE LAWSUITS ATTEMPT TO

ESTABLISH LIABILITY UNDER INSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED BY OUR UNDERWRITING

OPERATIONS

,

INCLUDING LIABILITY UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION LAWS AND FOR INJURY CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS PRODUCTS. PLAINTIFFS

IN THESE LAWSUITS ARE SEEKING MONEY DAMAGES THAT IN SOME CASES ARE SUBSTANTIAL

OR EXTRA CONTRACTUAL IN NATURE OR ARE SEEKING TO HAVE THE COURT DIRECT THE

ACTIVITIES OF OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN WAYS.

27

ALTHOUGH THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS NOT

PRESENTLY DETERMINABLE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE RESOLUTION OF ONE OR MORE

MATTERS MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE

THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNTS THAT WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE TO PAY

IN ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY OR

OVERALL FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE FOLLOWING IS A

SUMMARY OF CERTAIN LITIGATION MATTERS WITH CONTINGENCIES.

·

ASBESTOS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

ON JUNE 3, 2002, WE ANNOUNCED

THAT WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT SETTLING

ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE CLAIMS ARISING FROM ANY INSURING RELATIONSHIP OF UNITED

STATES FIDELITY AND GUARANTY COMPANY, ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE

COMPANY AND THEIR AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING US, WITH ANY OF

MACARTHUR COMPANY, WESTERN MACARTHUR COMPANY, AND WESTERN ASBESTOS COMPANY. IN JANUARY 2004,

THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ISSUED AN

ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND CONFIRMING THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES

PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. SEE FURTHER DISCUSSION IN NOTE 20 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, WE MADE A

PAYMENT OF $747 MILLION, (WHICH INCLUDED $7 MILLION INTEREST), RELATED TO THE

WESTERN MACARTHUR SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THAT AMOUNT, ALONG WITH $60 MILLION OF

AN INITIAL $235 MILLION PAYMENT MADE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, IS BEING

HELD IN ESCROW PENDING FINAL CONFIRMATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL OF

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. ACCORDINGLY,

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THESE PAYMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE AMOUNTS OF

$807 MILLION IN BOTH OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

·

PETROBRAS OIL RIG CONSTRUCTION

IN SEPTEMBER 2002, THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ENTERED A JUDGMENT

IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $370 MILLION TO PETROBRAS, AN ENERGY COMPANY

THAT IS MAJORITY-OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF BRAZIL, IN A CLAIM RELATED TO THE

CONSTRUCTION OF TWO OIL RIGS. ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDED A PORTION OF THE

SURETY COVERAGE FOR THAT CONSTRUCTION. AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A PRETAX LOSS

OF $34 MILLION ($22 MILLION AFTER-TAX) IN 2002 IN OUR SURETY &

CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE LOSS RECORDED WAS NET OF REINSURANCE AND

PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED CASE RESERVES FOR THIS EXPOSURE, AND PRIOR TO ANY

POSSIBLE RECOVERIES RELATED TO INDEMNITY. WE CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY PURSUE AN

APPEAL OF THIS JUDGMENT.

·

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002,

SEVERAL PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER, OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND US. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE

LAWSUITS WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE ACTION, WHICH MAKES VARIOUS

ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PREVIOUS PUBLIC DISCLOSURES AND

RESERVES RELATING TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION, AND SEEKS

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE AGREED

IN PRINCIPLE TO A SETTLEMENT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CUSTOMARY CONDITIONS

AND SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL. IF THE SETTLEMENT IS CONSUMMATED, IT WILL RESULT

IN OUR PAYMENT OF AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CORP., ET AL; ABERNATHY V. ACE AMERICAN INS. CO

IN 2003, LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN

TEXAS AND OHIO AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AND OTHER INSURERS AND

NON-INSURER CORPORATE DEFENDANTS, ASSERTING LIABILITY FOR FAILING TO WARN OF

THE DANGERS OF ASBESTOS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME FOR FINANCIAL

EXPOSURE REPRESENTED BY THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION IN LIGHT OF THE BROAD NATURE OF

THE RELIEF REQUESTED AND THE NOVEL THEORIES ASSERTED. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT

THE CASES ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND WE INTEND TO CONTEST THEM VIGOROUSLY. IN THIS

REGARD, WE FILED SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS IN ALL OF THE TEXAS CASES. IN OCTOBER 2003,

A COURT RULED ON THE SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS IN 11 OF THOSE CASES, DISMISSING THE

CASES WITH PREJUDICE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COURT DISMISSED ANOTHER CASE ON THE

SAME GROUNDS. WE VIEW THESE AS SIGNIFICANT RULINGS IN OUR FAVOR. THE SPECIAL

EXCEPTIONS IN THE REMAINING 50 CASES HAVE NOT YET BEEN RULED UPON. WE INTEND TO

FILE SIMILAR MOTIONS TO DISMISS IN THE OHIO CASES.

WORLD TRADE CENTER LITIGATION

IN 2002, WE AND CERTAIN OTHER

INSURERS OBTAINED A SUMMARY JUDGMENT RULING THAT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER (WTC)

PROPERTY LOSS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 WAS A SINGLE OCCURRENCE. CERTAIN

INSUREDS, INCLUDING THE WTCS LEASEHOLDER, APPEALED THAT RULING, ASKING THE

COURT TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROPERTY LOSS CONSTITUTED TWO SEPARATE OCCURRENCES

RATHER THAN ONE. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE U.S. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE SECOND CIRCUIT RULED THAT UNDER TERMS OF THE POLICY FORM WE USED TO

UNDERWRITE PROPERTY COVERAGE FOR THE WTC, THE TERRORIST ATTACK CONSTITUTED ONE

OCCURRENCE.

FARINA V. TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., ET AL

A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION WAS

RECENTLY FILED IN CONNECTICUT STATE COURT AGAINST TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY

CORP. AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALLEGING THAT THEY BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY

DUTIES TO TRAVELERS SHAREHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER

AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS INJUNCTIVE

RELIEF AS WELL AS UNSPECIFIED MONETARY DAMAGES. THE COMPLAINT ALSO NAMES THE

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARY, ADAMS ACQUISITION CORP., AS DEFENDANTS, ALLEGING

THAT THEY AIDED AND ABETTED THE ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. WE BELIEVE THIS

SUIT IS WHOLLY WITHOUT MERIT AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST IT.

IN 1990, AT THE DIRECTION

OF THE UK DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (DTI), FIVE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING

SUBSIDIARIES OF LONDON UNITED INVESTMENTS PLC (LUI) SUSPENDED UNDERWRITING NEW

INSURANCE BUSINESS. AT THE SAME TIME, FOUR OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES, BEING

INSOLVENT, SUSPENDED PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND HAVE SINCE BEEN PLACED IN

PROVISIONAL LIQUIDATION. THE FIFTH SUBSIDIARY, WALBROOK INSURANCE COMPANY,

CONTINUED PAYING CLAIMS UNTIL MAY OF 1992 WHEN IT WAS ALSO PLACED IN

PROVISIONAL INSOLVENT LIQUIDATION. WEAVERS UNDERWRITING AGENCY (WEAVERS), AN

LUI SUBSIDIARY, MANAGED THESE INSURERS. MINET, A FORMER INSURANCE BROKERAGE

SUBSIDIARY OF OURS, HAD BROKERED BUSINESS TO AND FROM WEAVERS FOR MANY YEARS. FROM

1973 THROUGH 1980, OUR UK-BASED UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS, NOW CALLED ST. PAUL

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY LTD. (SPI), HAD ACCEPTED BUSINESS FROM WEAVERS.

A PORTION OF THAT BUSINESS WAS CEDED BY SPI TO REINSURERS. CERTAIN OF THOSE

REINSURERS HAVE CHALLENGED THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN REINSURANCE CONTRACTS (OR

THE AMOUNT OF RECOVERY THEREUNDER) RELATING TO THE WEAVERS POOL, OF WHICH SPI

WAS A MEMBER, IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID LIABILITY UNDER THOSE CONTRACTS. SPI AND

OTHER MEMBERS OF THE WEAVERS POOL ARE SEEKING ENFORCEMENT OF THE REINSURANCE

CONTRACTS. MINET MAY ALSO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING FROM

ITS ROLE AS ONE OF THE MAJOR BROKERS FOR WEAVERS. WHEN WE SOLD MINET IN MAY 1997,

WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER FOR MOST OF MINETS THEN EXISTING

LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LIABILITIES RELATING TO THE WEAVERS MATTER. WE WILL

VIGOROUSLY CONTEST ANY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THE WEAVERS MATTER. WE RECOGNIZE

THAT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, IF ADVERSE TO US, MAY MATERIALLY

IMPACT THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THAT OUTCOME OCCURS. WE

BELIEVE THAT SUCH AN ADVERSE OUTCOME, HOWEVER, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIALLY

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY OR OVERALL FINANCIAL POSITION.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

THE ST. PAUL

COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

DECEMBER 31, 2003

THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC.

(THE ST. PAUL OR THE COMPANY) IS INCORPORATED AS A GENERAL BUSINESS

CORPORATION UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. THE ST. PAUL AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

CONSTITUTE ONE OF THE OLDEST INSURANCE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES,

DATING BACK TO 1853. WE ARE A MANAGEMENT COMPANY PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED, THROUGH

OUR SUBSIDIARIES, IN PROVIDING COMMERCIAL PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES. WE ALSO HAVE A PRESENCE IN THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY THROUGH

OUR 79% MAJORITY OWNERSHIP OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INC. AS A MANAGEMENT

COMPANY, WE OVERSEE THE OPERATIONS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND PROVIDE THEM WITH

CAPITAL, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. OUR INTERNET WEBSITE ADDRESS

IS

STPAUL.COM

. WE MAKE AVAILABLE, FREE OF

CHARGE, ON OR THROUGH OUR WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY

REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K AND AMENDMENTS

TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR 15(D) OF

THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER WE

ELECTRONICALLY FILE SUCH MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISH IT TO, THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION. OUR WEBSITE ADDRESS IS AN INACTIVE TEXTUAL REFERENCE ONLY

AND THE CONTENTS OF THE WEBSITE ARE NOT PART OF THIS REPORT.

OVERVIEW

THE COMPANY

GENERATES ITS RETURN ON CAPITAL PRIMARILY BY TAKING IN PREMIUMS, NET OF THE

EXPENSES TO GENERATE THOSE PREMIUMS AS WELL AS OTHER EXPENSES, AND INVESTING

THEM, PREDOMINANTLY IN FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, UNTIL THE COMPANY PAYS OUT

LOSSES RELATED TO THE INSURANCE COVERAGE PROVIDED. THE PRIMARY FACTORS

IMPACTING RETURNS WHICH ARE MONITORED REGULARLY BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE.

·

THE

ADEQUACY OF PREMIUMS CHARGED RELATIVE TO THE RISKS ASSUMED;

·

INVESTMENT

RETURNS ON THE PREMIUM CASH FLOWS;

34

·

EFFICIENCY

OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND ABILITY OF MANAGEMENT TO CONTROL EXPENSES; AND

·

THE

AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PAID LOSSES.

ADEQUACY OF

PREMIUMS

THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED

ITS FIFTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF GENERALLY INCREASING PRICES IN 2003. THESE

INCREASES EXCEEDED INCREASES IN OUR ESTIMATED LOSS TRENDS, RESULTING IN

IMPROVED MARGINS AND CASH FLOW. AVERAGE PRICE INCREASES DURING 2003 WERE 20% IN

OUR SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT AND 11% IN OUR COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT. WHILE

THE OVERALL ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF PRICE INCREASES IN 2003 SLOWED FROM 2002 LEVELS,

WE EXPECT OVERALL PRICE INCREASES IN 2004 TO CONTINUE TO EXCEED OVERALL

INCREASES IN ESTIMATED LOSS TRENDS. HOWEVER, THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CYCLICAL, AND PRICE COMPETITION

IN THE YEARS LEADING UP TO 1999 GENERALLY RESULTED IN DECLINING PROFITABILITY

IN THE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING TO

MONITOR PRICING AND PROFITABILITY, ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTIONS TO

MAXIMIZE PROFITABILITY AS PRICING OR PREMIUM ADEQUACY TRENDS CHANGE.

INVESTMENT RETURNS

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE

COMPANYS REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, NEARLY 90% OF

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES,

SECURITIES ON LOAN AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. LOWER RATES OF RETURN ON NEW

MONEY INVESTED IN RECENT YEARS HAVE REQUIRED HIGHER PREMIUM LEVELS TO GENERATE

THE SAME RETURNS ON CAPITAL. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DECREASING INTEREST

RATES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2000 HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FACTORS CAUSING

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE PRICES TO INCREASE. LIKEWISE, INCREASES IN NEW

MONEY INVESTMENT RATES WILL INCREASE INVESTMENT INCOME, BUT MAY RESULT IN

INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY AS COMPANIES COULD GENERATE THE

SAME RETURN ON EQUITY AT LOWER PREMIUM LEVELS. HOWEVER, IF NEW MONEY INVESTMENT

RATES INCREASE, THE VALUE OF OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO WILL DECREASE.

DURING 2003, THE COMPANYS AVERAGE NEW MONEY

INVESTMENT RATE WAS 4.5% FOR TAXABLE BONDS AND 3.1% FOR TAX-EXEMPTS, WHICH

REDUCED THE AVERAGE IMBEDDED PRE-TAX YIELD IN OUR LONG-TERM FIXED INCOME

PORTFOLIO TO 5.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, DOWN FROM 6.2% A YEAR EARLIER.

THE COMPANYS FIXED INCOME

PORTFOLIO MAINTAINS A VERY HIGH CREDIT QUALITY WITH AN AVERAGE RATING AT AA+

AND A RELATIVELY SHORT DURATION OF 3.8 YEARS WHICH MITIGATES THE RISKS OF

INCREASING INTEREST RATES AND WIDENING CREDIT SPREADS. DURING 2003, DURATION

LENGTHENED SLIGHTLY, FROM 3.3 YEARS.

EFFICIENCY OF THE

OPERATIONS

THE PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INDUSTRY GENERALLY MEASURES EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF WRITTEN PREMIUMS, A

COMPONENT OF REVENUE. MANAGEMENT USES A VARIETY OF MEASURES, INCLUDING THE

STATUTORY EXPENSE RATIO, TO EVALUATE ITS SUCCESS IN CONTROLLING EXPENSES. EXPENSES

CONSIST OF VARIABLE COMPONENTS, SUCH AS TAXES, FEES AND COMMISSIONS THAT ARE

CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM, AND FIXED COMPONENTS SUCH AS SALARIES,

BENEFITS, RENT AND SYSTEM COSTS. THE STATUTORY EXPENSE RATIO FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS 29.1, AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE COMPARABLE 2002

STATUTORY EXPENSE RATIO OF 29.7. WHILE THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN

VARIABLE COSTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2003 AS PREMIUMS GREW, THE STATUTORY

EXPENSE RATIO DECLINED. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCREASE IN PREMIUMS WAS

DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES AND NOT UNIT OR POLICY INCREASES, AND GENERALLY DID

NOT REQUIRE COMMENSURATE INCREASES IN FIXED EXPENSES TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT

DECREASES IN PREMIUMS WRITTEN IN OUR RUNOFF BUSINESSES, COMBINED WITH

CONTINUING EXPENSES TO MANAGE THOSE BUSINESSES, PREVENTED FURTHER IMPROVEMENT

IN OUR CONSOLIDATED EXPENSE RATIO IN 2003. WE EXPECT TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS IN

2004 WITH A GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF KEEPING EXPENSES LEVEL, EXCEPT FOR VARIABLE

EXPENSES THAT VARY WITH PREMIUM PRODUCTION, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES AND

COMMISSIONS.

35

ACCORDINGLY,

ABSENT UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRICING ENVIRONMENT, WE EXPECT OUR

STATUTORY EXPENSE RATIO TO GENERALLY REMAIN STABLE OR IMPROVE IN 2004.

THE AMOUNT AND

TIMING OF PAID LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THE

AMOUNT IT EXPECTS TO PAY CLAIMANTS FOR INSURED LOSSES AND THE COST OF

INVESTIGATING, RESOLVING AND PROCESSING THOSE CLAIMS. GIVEN THE INHERENT

UNCERTAINTY IN THE RESERVING PROCESS AND THAT MANY OF THE COVERAGES WE OFFER

INVOLVE CLAIMS THAT MAY NOT ULTIMATELY BE SETTLED FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THEY ARE

INCURRED, OUR ESTIMATES MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE AMOUNTS WE

ULTIMATELY PAY OR INCUR WITH RESPECT TO INSURED LOSSES. IF OUR ESTIMATES

CHANGE, WE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR RESERVES AND THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE REFLECTED

IN OUR INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD. ONE MEASURE MANAGEMENT USES TO

ASSESS OUR PROFITABILITY IS OUR STATUTORY COMBINED RATIO, WHICH REFLECTS THE

SUM OF THE STATUTORY LOSS RATIO (INCURRED LOSSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF EARNED

PREMIUM) AND THE STATUTORY EXPENSE RATIO DESCRIBED ABOVE. OUR LOSS RATIO

IMPROVED FROM 79.9 IN 2002 TO 73.4 IN 2003. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, INCREASING

PRICING HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE COMBINED RATIO IN OUR ONGOING SEGMENTS,

WHICH DROPPED FROM 108.6 IN 2001 TO 95.8 IN 2002 AND 91.7 IN 2003.

PROPOSED MERGER

WITH TRAVELERS

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER 17,

2003, WILL BE A TRANSFORMING EVENT FOR THE ST. PAUL. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

THE PROPOSED MERGER WILL CREATE A PREMIER PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

COMPANY THAT WILL BE WELL POSITIONED FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS AND THE CREATION OF

SUPERIOR SHAREHOLDER VALUE IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE INDUSTRY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL HAVE

SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT BREADTH AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH AND WILL BE UNIQUELY

POSITIONED AS THE PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURER OF CHOICE FOR AGENTS, BROKERS AND

CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ST. PAUL WILL

BENEFIT FROM THE COMBINED FINANCIAL RESOURCES, MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL OF THE

TWO COMPANIES AND WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON OPPORTUNITIES IN THE

INSURANCE INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE PROPOSED MERGER

WILL PERMIT THE ST. PAUL TO DERIVE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES FROM THE MORE

EFFICIENT UTILIZATION OF THE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL OF TWO COMPANIES.

THESE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES DO NOT COME WITHOUT RISKS. IN PARTICULAR, IT

WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO INTEGRATE THE BUSINESSES OF THE ST. PAUL AND

TRAVELERS IN AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. FURTHERMORE, SINCE THE RISKS

AND UNCERTAINTIES FACING EACH OF THE ST. PAUL AND TRAVELERS DIFFER, THE RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY OF THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE

AFFECTED BY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DIFFERENT FROM THOSE CURRENTLY EFFECTING

EACH OF THE ST. PAUL AND TRAVELERS ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT

THE PROPOSED MERGER TO CLOSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004.

OUR PRETAX INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $836

MILLION IN 2003 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE 2002 TOTAL OF $176 MILLION,

DUE TO STRONG IMPROVEMENT IN RESULTS PRODUCED BY OUR ONGOING PROPERTY-LIABILITY

UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS. OUR 2003 RESULT INCLUDED A TOTAL OF $646 MILLION IN

PRETAX LOSS PROVISIONS TO STRENGTHEN PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES, OF WHICH $350

MILLION WAS RECORDED IN OUR RUNOFF HEALTH CARE OPERATION AND $260 MILLION WAS

RECORDED IN OUR OTHER RUNOFF OPERATIONS. OUR MAJORITY-OWNED ASSET MANAGEMENT

SUBSIDIARY, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INC., ACHIEVED ITS NINTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR

OF RECORD RESULTS IN 2003, DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT. IN 2002, OUR PRETAX RESULTS INCLUDED A $472 MILLION LOSS PROVISION,

NET OF REINSURANCE, RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WE ENTERED INTO WITH

RESPECT TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION (DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL

LATER IN THIS DISCUSSION). OUR PRETAX LOSS OF $1.43 BILLION IN 2001 WAS

DOMINATED BY $941 MILLION OF PRETAX LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SEPTEMBER 11,

2001 TERRORIST ATTACK AND PRETAX PROVISIONS TOTALING $735 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN

PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES IN OUR HEALTH CARE BUSINESS CENTER. THE 2003 AND 2002

PRETAX LOSSES IN THE PARENT COMPANY AND OTHER OPERATIONS CATEGORY (WHICH

PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATIVE AND DEBT SERVICE EXPENSES AT

THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN COMPARABLE LOSS IN

2001 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DISTRIBUTIONS RELATED TO PREFERRED

SECURITIES ISSUED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON PRETAX EARNINGS WAS 16% IN

2003, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE BENEFIT OF INVESTMENT INCOME FROM TAX-EXEMPT

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES IN OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT OPERATIONS SEGMENT.

IN 2002, OUR INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $73 MILLION ON PRETAX INCOME OF $176 MILLION

INCLUDED $124 MILLION OF TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH NET REALIZED INVESTMENT

LOSSES. THAT $124 MILLION REFLECTED A $207 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO THE SALE

OF CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND ALL OTHER NET REALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES, AND $83 MILLION OF TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE TRANSFER OF OUR ONGOING

REINSURANCE OPERATIONS (DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL LATER IN THIS DISCUSSION). IN

2002, WE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED THE REFOCUSING OF OUR INTERNATIONAL

PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS. AS PART OF THAT EFFORT, WE SOLD

CERTAIN OF THOSE OPERATIONS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, RESULTING IN A NET

AFTER-TAX REALIZED GAIN OF $132 MILLION THAT WAS PREDOMINANTLY COMPRISED OF THE

AFOREMENTIONED TAX BENEFITS. THE PRETAX IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS IN 2002 FROM

THOSE SALES WAS NOMINAL, AS SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN

REFLECTED IN OUR REPORTED RESULTS FOR THESE OPERATIONS PRIOR TO THEIR

DIVESTITURE.

37

AS A RESULT OF

IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS OF A NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT IN 2002

(DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL LATER IN THIS DISCUSSION), WE DID NOT RECORD ANY

GOODWILL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN 2003 OR 2002. IN 2001, EXPENSES RELATED TO

GOODWILL TOTALED $114 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $73 MILLION OF GOODWILL

WRITE-DOWNS RELATED TO BUSINESSES WE DECIDED TO EXIT. AMORTIZATION EXPENSE

RELATED TO OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS TOTALED $31 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH

$18 MILLION IN 2002 AND $2 MILLION IN 2001.

2003 VS. 2002THE 6% DECLINE IN INSURANCE PREMIUMS

EARNED IN 2003 WAS CENTERED IN OUR RUNOFF OTHER SEGMENT, REFLECTING THE IMPACT

OF OUR DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM LINES OF BUSINESS INCLUDED IN THAT SEGMENT. IN

OUR ONGOING PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS, EARNED PREMIUMS OF $6.71

BILLION WERE 22% HIGHER THAN COMPARABLE 2002 EARNED PREMIUMS OF $5.52 BILLION,

DUE TO A COMBINATION OF NEW BUSINESS, HIGHER BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS AND

PRICE INCREASES. THE $49 MILLION DECLINE IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2003 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN INVESTMENT YIELDS ON NEW INVESTMENTS, AND A

REDUCED AMOUNT OF INVESTED ASSETS DURING 2003 RESULTING FROM THE FIRST-QUARTER

PAYMENT OF $747 MILLION RELATED TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. ASSET MANAGEMENT REVENUES GREW 14% OVER 2002, DRIVEN BY A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES RESULTING FROM A $15.6 BILLION

INCREASE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS IN 2003 WERE

DRIVEN BY SALES OF CERTAIN VENTURE CAPITAL AND EQUITY HOLDINGS. THE INCREASE IN

OTHER REVENUES IN 2003 OVER 2002 WAS LARGELY DUE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

GAINS.

2002 VS. 2001EARNED

PREMIUMS IN 2002 GREW 1% OVER 2001, AS THE POSITIVE IMPACTS OF SIGNIFICANT

PRICE INCREASES IN 2001 AND 2002 AND NEW BUSINESS IN MANY OF OUR ONGOING

OPERATIONS WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY OUR WITHDRAWAL FROM SEVERAL LINES OF BUSINESS

AND THE TRANSFER OF OUR ONGOING REINSURANCE OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM. EARNED

PREMIUMS OF $5.52 BILLION GENERATED BY OUR TWO ONGOING PROPERTY-LIABILITY

UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS IN 2002 GREW 24% OVER COMPARABLE 2001 EARNED PREMIUMS OF

$4.44 BILLION, WHEREAS EARNED PREMIUMS PRODUCED BY OUR RUNOFF SEGMENT IN 2002

DECLINED 33% COMPARED WITH 2001. NET INVESTMENT INCOME DECLINED 4% FROM 2001,

PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED YIELDS ON NEW INVESTMENTS. REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES

IN 2002 WERE CONCENTRATED IN OUR VENTURE CAPITAL AND EQUITY PORTFOLIOS AND

INCLUDED LOSSES ORIGINATING FROM SALES OF INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS IMPAIRMENT

WRITE-DOWNS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR OTHER REVENUES CONSISTED OF RISK MANAGEMENT

CONSULTING FEES AND CLAIM SERVICING FEES IN OUR INSURANCE UNDERWRITING

OPERATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES.

REVISIONS TO

BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE

IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2003, WE REVISED OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE BUSINESS SEGMENT

REPORTING STRUCTURE TO REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE BUSINESSES ARE MANAGED.

OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS CONSIST OF TWO SEGMENTS

CONSTITUTING OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS (

SPECIALTY

COMMERCIAL

AND

38

COMMERCIAL LINES

), AND ONE SEGMENT

COMPRISING OUR RUNOFF OPERATIONS

(OTHER).

THE COMPOSITION OF THOSE RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS IS DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN

THE ANALYSIS OF THEIR RESULTS LATER IN THIS DISCUSSION. THE FOLLOWING IS A

SUMMARY OF CHANGES MADE TO OUR SEGMENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003.

·

OUR

SURETY & CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TOGETHER AS A

SEPARATE SPECIALTY SEGMENT, ARE NOW SEPARATE COMPONENTS OF OUR

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

SEGMENT.

·

OUR

ONGOING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS,

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TOGETHER AS A SEPARATE SPECIALTY SEGMENT, ARE NOW SEPARATE

COMPONENTS OF OUR

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

SEGMENT.

·

OUR

HEALTH CARE, REINSURANCE AND OTHER OPERATIONS, EACH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS A

SEPARATE RUNOFF BUSINESS SEGMENT, HAVE BEEN COMBINED INTO A SINGLE

OTHER

RUNOFF SEGMENT AND ARE UNDER COMMON

MANAGEMENT. RUNOFF MEANS THAT WE HAVE CEASED OR PLAN TO CEASE UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

·

THE

RESULTS OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS, AS WELL AS LOSS

DEVELOPMENT ON BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN PRIOR TO 1980 (PRIOR TO 1988 FOR BUSINESS

ACQUIRED IN OUR MERGER WITH USF&G CORPORATION IN 1998), PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED

IN OUR

COMMERCIAL LINES

SEGMENT,

ARE NOW INCLUDED IN THE

OTHER

SEGMENT.

IN ADDITION TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS, THIS PRIOR YEAR

BUSINESS INCLUDED THE MAJORITY OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS LIABILITY

EXPOSURES. THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE EXPOSURES IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SAME

MANAGEMENT TEAM RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE

OTHER

SEGMENT.

IN ADDITION, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, OUR

SPECIALTY PROGRAMS

BUSINESS CENTER,

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN OUR SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, WAS MOVED TO OUR

COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS

BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN AND MANAGED. SEE THE COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT

DISCUSSION BELOW FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE

SPECIALTY PROGRAMS

BUSINESS CENTER. ALL DATA FOR 2002 AND

2001 INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT WERE RESTATED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES

MADE TO OUR SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF

2003.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 131, DISCLOSURES

ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, SINCE SURETY &

CONSTRUCTION, INTERNATIONAL & LLOYDS, HEALTH CARE, AND REINSURANCE

WERE REPORTED AS SEPARATE SEGMENTS DURING 2002 AND ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OF

CONTINUING SIGNIFICANCE IN ANALYZING THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS, WE CONTINUE

TO SEPARATELY PRESENT AND DISCUSS (AS APPROPRIATE) IN NOTE 3 TO OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS,

INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE BUSINESSES IN 2003 AND THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF

2002 AND 2001.

OUR OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF DO NOT QUALIFY AS DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003,

THESE RUNOFF OPERATIONS COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTED FOR $327 MILLION, OR 5%, OF OUR

NET EARNED PREMIUMS, AND GENERATED UNDERWRITING LOSSES TOTALING $762 MILLION

(AN AMOUNT THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE ASSETS MAINTAINED

TO SUPPORT THESE OPERATIONS). FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, THESE

RUNOFF OPERATIONS COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTED FOR $1.98 BILLION, OR 26%, OF OUR NET

EARNED PREMIUMS, AND GENERATED UNDERWRITING LOSSES TOTALING $874 MILLION, AN

AMOUNT THAT INCLUDED A $585 MILLION PRETAX LOSS PROVISION RELATED TO THE

WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2001, THESE RUNOFF OPERATIONS COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTED FOR $2.97 BILLION, OR 40%,

OF OUR NET EARNED PREMIUMS, AND GENERATED UNDERWRITING LOSSES TOTALING $1.87

BILLION, AN AMOUNT THAT INCLUDED A $735 MILLION PRETAX LOSS PROVISION TO

STRENGTHEN PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES IN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION AND $662

MILLION OF PRETAX LOSSES RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST

ATTACK.

OUR CONSOLIDATED NET LOSS

AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES OF $13.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003

AND $14.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $5.6 BILLION

AND $8.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF NET RESERVES RELATED TO OUR RUNOFF SEGMENT. THE

PAYMENT OF CLAIMS FROM THESE RESERVES WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT

INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS AS THE INVESTED ASSETS RELATED TO THESE RESERVES

DECLINE.

39

TRANSFER OF ONGOING

REINSURANCE OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD.

ON NOVEMBER 1, 2002, WE COMPLETED THE TRANSFER OF

OUR CONTINUING REINSURANCE BUSINESS (PREVIOUSLY OPERATING UNDER THE NAME ST.

PAUL RE) AND CERTAIN RELATED ASSETS, INCLUDING RENEWAL RIGHTS, TO PLATINUM

UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD. (PLATINUM), A BERMUDA COMPANY FORMED IN 2002 THAT

UNDERWRITES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS.

AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION, WE CONTRIBUTED $122

MILLION OF CASH TO PLATINUM AND TRANSFERRED $349 MILLION IN ASSETS RELATING TO

THE INSURANCE RESERVES THAT WE ALSO TRANSFERRED. IN EXCHANGE, WE ACQUIRED SIX

MILLION COMMON SHARES, REPRESENTING A 14% EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

PLATINUM, AND A TEN-YEAR OPTION TO BUY UP TO SIX MILLION ADDITIONAL COMMON

SHARES AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $27 PER SHARE, WHICH REPRESENTS 120% OF THE

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF PLATINUMS SHARES.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRANSFER OF OUR CONTINUING

REINSURANCE BUSINESS TO PLATINUM, WE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS WITH

PLATINUM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS BY

WHICH PLATINUM REINSURED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ENTERED

INTO BY ST. PAUL RE ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2002. THIS TRANSFER (BASED ON SEPTEMBER 30,

2002 BALANCES) INCLUDED $125 MILLION OF UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES (NET OF

CEDING COMMISSIONS), $200 MILLION OF EXISTING LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES AND $24 MILLION OF OTHER REINSURANCE-RELATED LIABILITIES. THE TRANSFER

OF UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES TO PLATINUM WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS PROSPECTIVE

REINSURANCE, WHILE THE TRANSFER OF EXISTING LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE TRANSFER OF RESERVES TO PLATINUM

AT THE INCEPTION OF THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WAS BASED ON THE SEPTEMBER 30,

2002 BALANCES. IN MARCH 2003, WE TRANSFERRED TO PLATINUM $137 MILLION OF

ADDITIONAL INSURANCE RESERVES, CONSISTING OF $72 MILLION IN UNEARNED PREMIUMS

(NET OF CEDING COMMISSIONS) AND $65 MILLION IN EXISTING RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. WE ALSO TRANSFERRED CASH AND OTHER ASSETS HAVING A

VALUE EQUAL TO THE ADDITIONAL INSURANCE RESERVES TRANSFERRED. THIS TRANSFER OF

ADDITIONAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECTED BUSINESS ACTIVITY BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 30,

2002 AND THE NOVEMBER 2, 2002 INCEPTION DATE OF THE QUOTA SHARE

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, AND OUR ESTIMATE OF AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE ADJUSTMENT

PROVISIONS OF THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. OUR INSURANCE RESERVES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002 INCLUDED OUR ESTIMATE, AT THAT TIME, OF AMOUNTS DUE TO

PLATINUM UNDER THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, WHICH TOTALED $54

MILLION. THE $83 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR ESTIMATE OF AMOUNTS DUE TO PLATINUM

UNDER THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS RESULTED IN A PRETAX UNDERWRITING

LOSS OF $6 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2003, WE REACHED FINAL AGREEMENT WITH PLATINUM REGARDING THE ADJUSTMENT

PROVISIONS OF THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS AND NO FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS

TO THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WILL OCCUR.

FOR BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE

UNITED KINGDOM, UNTIL OCTOBER 31, 2003 PLATINUM HAD THE RIGHT TO

UNDERWRITE SPECIFIED REINSURANCE BUSINESS ON OUR BEHALF IN CASES WHERE PLATINUM

WAS UNABLE TO UNDERWRITE THAT BUSINESS BECAUSE IT HAD YET TO OBTAIN NECESSARY

REGULATORY LICENSES OR APPROVAL TO DO SO, OR PLATINUM HAD NOT YET BEEN APPROVED

AS A REINSURER BY THE CEDING COMPANY. WE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT SOLELY AS

A MEANS TO ACCOMMODATE PLATINUM THROUGH A TRANSITION PERIOD. ANY BUSINESS

WRITTEN BY PLATINUM ON OUR POLICY FORMS DURING THIS TRANSITION PERIOD WAS FULLY

CEDED TO PLATINUM UNDER THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS.

THE TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A PRETAX GAIN OF $29

MILLION AND AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $54 MILLION IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2002. THE AFTER-TAX LOSS WAS DRIVEN BY THE WRITE-OFF OF APPROXIMATELY $73

MILLION IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY INCURRED LOSSES

RELATED TO ST. PAUL RES UNITED KINGDOM-BASED OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS APPROXIMATELY

$10 MILLION IN TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRETAX GAIN.

OUR INVESTMENT IN PLATINUM

IS INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS.  THE

ESTIMATED INCOME FROM OUR 14% PROPORTIONATE EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN PLATINUM IS

INCLUDED IN OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AS A COMPONENT OF

40

NET

INVESTMENT INCOME.  OUR OPTION TO

PURCHASE ADDITIONAL PLATINUM SHARES IS CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE ($65 MILLION AND

$61 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY), WITH CHANGES IN

ITS FAIR VALUE RECORDED AS OTHER REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES IN OUR STATEMENT OF

OPERATIONS. IN 2003 AND 2002, WE RECORDED NET PRETAX REALIZED GAINS OF $4

MILLION AND $7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THIS OPTION.

ACQUISITIONS AND

DIVESTITURES

IN DECEMBER 2003, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF

CAMPERDOWN UK LIMITED, ONE OF OUR LLOYDS CORPORATE NAMES AND THE VEHICLE FOR

OUR PARTICIPATION ON THE 2003 AND PRIOR YEARS OF ACCOUNT, TO FOLTUS INVESTMENTS

LIMITED. WE RECOGNIZED A $2 MILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THIS TRANSACTION. AT LLOYDS,

WE UNDERWRITE BUSINESS THROUGH A SINGLE SYNDICATE (SYNDICATE 5000) FOR WHICH

WE PROVIDE 100% OF THE CAPITAL. IN 2003, FIRE AND MARINE ENTERED INTO A 100%

QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT DIRECTLY WITH SYNDICATE 5000 THAT IN EFFECT

TRANSFERRED SYNDICATE 5000S UNDERWRITING RESULTS FOR THE 2003 YEAR OF ACCOUNT

TO FIRE AND MARINE. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, WE

ACTIVATED TWO CORPORATE NAMES THAT WILL BE USED FOR 2004 AND FUTURE YEARS OF

ACCOUNT TO UNDERWRITE SYNDICATE 5000 BUSINESS.

IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE ST. PAUL AND TRAVELERS

PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT.

SEE ITEM 1 IN THIS REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED MERGER.

IN OCTOBER 2003, WE SOLD OUR SUBSIDIARY, OCTAGON

RISK SERVICES, INC., A CLAIM MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES COMPANY,

FOR PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION. WE RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN OF $5

MILLION ON THE SALE.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, WE SOLD OUR SUBSIDIARY

BOTSWANA INSURANCE COMPANY LTD. FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $11 MILLION, AND RECORDED

A PRETAX LOSS OF LESS THAN $1 MILLION.

IN MAY 2003, WE PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO SEEK

RENEWAL OF SEVERAL LINES OF INSURANCE BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY UNDERWRITTEN BY

KEMPER INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE INITIAL PAYMENT FOR THIS RIGHT WAS RECORDED AS

AN INTANGIBLE ASSET (CHARACTERIZED AS RENEWAL RIGHTS) AND IS BEING AMORTIZED ON

AN ACCELERATED BASIS OVER FOUR YEARS. THE PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESS INVOLVED IN

THIS TRANSACTION INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING LINES: TECHNOLOGY, SMALL COMMERCIAL,

MIDDLE MARKET COMMERCIAL, INLAND AND OCEAN MARINE, AND ARCHITECTS AND

ENGINEERS PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY. WE DID NOT ASSUME ANY PAST LIABILITIES WITH

THIS PURCHASE; HOWEVER, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT IN JUNE 2004

BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PREMIUM VOLUME WE ULTIMATELY RENEW DURING THE TWELVE

MONTH PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO THIS PURCHASE. WE BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY

ADDITIONAL PAYMENT WOULD EXCEED $30 MILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE HAD

ACCRUED $10 MILLION TOWARD THIS ADDITIONAL OBLIGATION, RECORDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES.  OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS

WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 INCLUDED

APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN AS A RESULT OF

THIS PURCHASE OF RENEWAL RIGHTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN OUR

COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT.

IN DECEMBER 2002, WE ACQUIRED THE RIGHT TO SEEK

TO RENEW THE PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISK PRACTICE BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY

UNDERWRITTEN BY ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE IN THE UNITED STATES, WITHOUT

ASSUMING PAST LIABILITIES. THAT BUSINESS GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION IN

WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2003. THE NOMINAL COST OF THIS ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED

FOR AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET AND IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER FOUR YEARS.

IN DECEMBER 2002, WE SOLD OUR INSURANCE

OPERATIONS IN SPAIN AND ARGENTINA AND ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS IN MEXICO EXCEPT

OUR SURETY BUSINESS. PROCEEDS FROM THESE SALES TOTALED $29 MILLION, AND WE

RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN OF $4 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALES.

IN MARCH 2002, WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF

LONDON GUARANTEE INSURANCE COMPANY (LONDON GUARANTEE, NOW OPERATING UNDER THE

NAME ST. PAUL GUARANTEE), A SPECIALTY PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE COMPANY

FOCUSED ON PROVIDING SURETY PRODUCTS AND MANAGEMENT LIABILITY, BOND, AND

PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY PRODUCTS. THE TOTAL COST OF THE ACQUISITION WAS

APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $18

41

MILLION REPRESENTED

GOODWILL AND $37 MILLION REPRESENTED OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE PURCHASE

PRICE WAS FUNDED THROUGH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS.

IN DECEMBER 2001, WE PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO SEEK

TO RENEW SURETY BOND BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY UNDERWRITTEN BY FIREMANS FUND

INSURANCE COMPANY (FIREMANS FUND), WITHOUT ASSUMING PAST LIABILITIES. WE

PAID FIREMANS FUND $10 MILLION IN CONSIDERATION, WHICH WE RECORDED AS AN

INTANGIBLE ASSET AND WHICH WE EXPECT TO AMORTIZE OVER NINE YEARS. BASED ON THE

VOLUME OF BUSINESS RENEWED DURING 2002, WE MADE A MODEST ADDITIONAL PAYMENT TO

FIREMANS FUND IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. THAT AMOUNT WAS ALSO RECORDED AS

AN INTANGIBLE ASSET AND IS BEING AMORTIZED ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS OVER THE

REMAINING LIFE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET.

IN JANUARY 2001, WE ACQUIRED THE RIGHT TO SEEK TO

RENEW A BOOK OF MUNICIPALITY INSURANCE BUSINESS FROM PENCO, A PROGRAM

ADMINISTRATOR FOR WILLIS NORTH AMERICA INC., FOR A TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF $3.5

MILLION. THE COST WAS RECORDED AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET AND IS BEING AMORTIZED

OVER FIVE YEARS.

IN ADDITION, NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS MADE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS IN BOTH 2002 AND 2001, WHICH ARE

DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE ASSET MANAGEMENT SECTION OF THIS

DISCUSSION.

DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS

LIFE INSURANCEIN SEPTEMBER 2001, WE COMPLETED

THE SALE OF OUR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, FIDELITY AND GUARANTY LIFE INSURANCE

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARY, THOMAS JEFFERSON LIFE (TOGETHER, F&G LIFE) TO

OLD MUTUAL PLC (OLD MUTUAL), FOR $335 MILLION IN CASH AND $300 MILLION IN

ORDINARY SHARES OF OLD MUTUAL. IN JUNE 2002, WE SOLD ALL OF THE OLD MUTUAL

SHARES WE WERE HOLDING FOR A TOTAL NET CONSIDERATION OF $287 MILLION, RESULTING

IN A PRETAX REALIZED LOSS OF $13 MILLION THAT WAS RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ON OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN 2002. AT THE TIME OF

THE SALE OF THE OLD MUTUAL SHARES, THERE WAS A DERIVATIVE COLLAR AGREEMENT IN

PLACE THAT WOULD HAVE DETERMINED ANY POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE ORIGINAL

F&G LIFE SALE PRICE ONE YEAR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.  THE COLLAR WAS RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET

AS AN ASSET AND HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $12 MILLION WHEN WE SOLD OUR OLD MUTUAL

SHARES. WE AGREED TO TERMINATE THE COLLAR AT NO VALUE AS PART OF THE SALE OF

OUR OLD MUTUAL SHARES. THAT $12 MILLION PRETAX LOSS WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ON OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN 2002.

AT THE TIME OF THE SALE OF F&G LIFE IN 2001, WE

RECORDED A NET AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $74 MILLION ON THE SALE PROCEEDS. THAT LOSS

WAS COMBINED WITH F&G LIFES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRIOR TO SALE FOR AN

AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $55 MILLION AND WAS INCLUDED IN THE REPORTED LOSS FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001.

STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCEIN 1999, WE SOLD OUR

STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS TO METROPOLITAN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE COMPANY (METROPOLITAN). METROPOLITAN PURCHASED ECONOMY FIRE &

CASUALTY COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (ECONOMY), AND THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN

THOSE NON-ECONOMY POLICIES CONSTITUTING THE REMAINDER OF OUR STANDARD PERSONAL

INSURANCE OPERATIONS. THOSE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS WERE TRANSFERRED TO

METROPOLITAN BY WAY OF A REINSURANCE AND FACILITY AGREEMENT. WE GUARANTEED THE

ADEQUACY OF ECONOMYS LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVES, AND WE REMAIN LIABLE FOR

CLAIMS ON NON-ECONOMY POLICIES THAT RESULT FROM LOSSES OCCURRING PRIOR TO THE SEPTEMBER 30,

1999 CLOSING DATE. UNDER THE RESERVE-RELATED AGREEMENTS, WE AGREED TO PAY FOR

ANY DEFICIENCIES IN THOSE RESERVES AND WOULD SHARE IN ANY REDUNDANCIES THAT

DEVELOPED BY SEPTEMBER 30, 2002. ANY LOSSES INCURRED BY US UNDER THESE

AGREEMENTS WERE REFLECTED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH

THEY WERE INCURRED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, OUR ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT WE

OWED METROPOLITAN $13 MILLION RELATED TO THE RESERVE AGREEMENTS, WHICH WAS PAID

IN APRIL 2003. WE HAVE NO OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATED TO THIS

SALE.

42

NONSTANDARD AUTO INSURANCEIN 1999, PRUDENTIAL

PURCHASED OUR NONSTANDARD AUTO INSURANCE BUSINESS MARKETED UNDER THE VICTORIA

FINANCIAL AND TITAN AUTO BRANDS FOR $175 MILLION IN CASH (NET OF A $25 MILLION

DIVIDEND PAID BY THESE OPERATIONS TO OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE

OPERATIONS PRIOR TO CLOSING). WE RECORDED AN ESTIMATED AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $83

MILLION ON THE SALE, REPRESENTING THE ESTIMATED EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF

THESE ENTITIES AT CLOSING DATE OVER PROCEEDS TO BE RECEIVED FROM THE SALE, PLUS

ESTIMATED INCOME THROUGH THE DISPOSAL DATE. THIS EXCESS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF

GOODWILL. WE RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF $9 MILLION IN 2000,

PRIMARILY REPRESENTING ADDITIONAL LOSSES INCURRED THROUGH THE DISPOSAL DATE IN

MAY, AND AN ADDITIONAL AFTER-TAX LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF $5 MILLION IN 2001,

PRIMARILY REPRESENTING TAX ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE SALE TRANSACTION.

MINETIN 1997, WE SOLD OUR INSURANCE BROKERAGE

OPERATION, MINET HOLDINGS PLC (MINET) TO AON CORPORATION. WE RECORDED

EXPENSES IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS RELATED TO

THE MINET SALE. IN 2003, WE RECORDED EXPENSE PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN ADJUSTMENT

TO THE TAX PROVISION ON THE SALE, WHEREAS THE EXPENSES RECORDED IN 2002 AND

2001 PRIMARILY REPRESENTED ADDITIONAL FUNDS DUE AON PURSUANT TO PROVISIONS OF

THE SALE AGREEMENT.

OUR OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF DO NOT QUALIFY AS DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

ASBESTOS SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT

ON JUNE 3, 2002, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE AND CERTAIN

OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT SETTLING ALL EXISTING AND

FUTURE CLAIMS ARISING FROM ANY INSURING RELATIONSHIP OF UNITED STATES FIDELITY

AND GUARANTY COMPANY (USF&G), ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY

AND THEIR AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING US (COLLECTIVELY, THE USF&G

PARTIES) WITH ANY OF MACARTHUR COMPANY, WESTERN MACARTHUR COMPANY (WESTERN

MACARTHUR), AND WESTERN ASBESTOS COMPANY (WESTERN ASBESTOS) (TOGETHER, THE MACARTHUR

COMPANIES).

43

PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT, ON NOVEMBER 22, 2002, THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES FILED VOLUNTARY

PETITIONS UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE TO PERMIT THE CHANNELING OF

ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS SOLELY TO A TRUST TO BE

ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. CONSUMMATION

OF MOST ELEMENTS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS CONTINGENT UPON BANKRUPTCY

COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AS PART OF A BROADER PLAN FOR THE

REORGANIZATION OF THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES (THE PLAN). IN JANUARY 2004,

THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ISSUED AN

ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES AND

CONFIRMING THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION.  WE ARE AWAITING FINAL CONFIRMATION OF THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT ORDER.

THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION INCLUDES AN INJUNCTION IN

FAVOR OF THE ST. PAUL AGAINST ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT LIABILITY FOR

ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES. UNDER THE INJUNCTION,

ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS OF THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES WILL

BE CHANNELED TO, AND PAID SOLELY FROM, THE TRUST ESTABLISHED BY THE PLAN. THE

MACARTHUR COMPANIES WILL RELEASE THE USF&G PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL ASBESTOS-RELATED

CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY, AND ALL OTHER CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF $1 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE, THAT MAY BE ASSERTED RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM, DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY, ANY ALLEGED COVERAGE PROVIDED BY ANY OF THE USF&G PARTIES TO

ANY OF THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR EXTRA CONTRACTUAL

RELIEF.

THE ST. PAUL HAS COMPLETED ITS FUNDING OBLIGATIONS

UNDER THE 2002 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, CONSISTING OF PAYMENTS OF $235 MILLION

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, AND $747 MILLION ON JANUARY 16, 2003

(INCLUDING INTEREST). FOLLOWING FINAL CONFIRMATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

RULING, THE ESCROWED FUNDS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE TRUST ESTABLISHED BY THE

PLAN FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS. THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDED FOR THE USF&G PARTIES TO PAY $13 MILLION

(WHICH WAS PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002) AND TO ADVANCE CERTAIN FEES AND

EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS,

FINALIZATION OF THE PLAN AND EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, SUBJECT

TO A RIGHT OF REIMBURSEMENT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF AMOUNTS ADVANCED.  UP TO $175 MILLION OF THE INITIAL $235 MILLION

PAYMENT WILL BE PAID TO COUNSEL FOR THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES, AND PERSONS

HOLDING JUDGMENTS AGAINST THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES AS OF JUNE 3, 2002 AND

THEIR COUNSEL, AND THE USF&G PARTIES WILL BE RELEASED FROM CLAIMS BY SUCH

HOLDERS TO THE EXTENT OF $110 MILLION PAID TO SUCH HOLDERS. AT LEAST $60

MILLION FROM THE INITIAL PAYMENT AND THE $747 MILLION PAID IN 2003 WOULD BE

RETURNED TO US IF FINAL CONFIRMATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT RULING DOES NOT

OCCUR. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THOSE PAYMENTS OF $807 MILLION WERE RECORDED

IN BOTH OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

FEES RECOVERABLE FROM OTHERS). ON JANUARY 16, 2003, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS

OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE PAID THE REMAINING $740 MILLION SETTLEMENT

AMOUNT, PLUS INTEREST, TO THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE IN RESPECT OF THIS MATTER. AS

A RESULT, AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 OUR GROSS ASBESTOS RESERVES INCLUDED NO

AMOUNT RELATED TO WESTERN MACARTHUR.

ASBESTOS RESERVES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS SECTION OF THIS

DISCUSSION).

POSSIBLE ASBESTOS

LEGISLATION

FROM TIME TO TIME ASBESTOS

REFORM BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE U.S. CONGRESS. SOME OF THESE PROPOSED

LAWS SEEK TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE CURRENT PERSONAL INJURY LITIGATION BY

REPLACING IT WITH A STATUTORY COMPENSATION PROGRAM FUNDED BY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM

A VARIETY OF SOURCES WHICH MAY INCLUDE COMPANIES THAT FORMERLY MANUFACTURED,

DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD ASBESTOS PRODUCTS AND INSURERS THAT UNDERWROTE CERTAIN

ASBESTOS RISKS. MANY OF THESE REFORM EFFORTS WOULD NOT COVER ASBESTOS PROPERTY

DAMAGE CLAIMS AND OTHER CATEGORIES OF ASBESTOS EXPOSURE INCLUDING FUTURE

PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS IF THE COMPENSATION FUND ULTIMATELY PROVES INSUFFICIENT.

THE PROSPECTS FOR THE PASSAGE OF AN ASBESTOS REFORM BILL REMAIN UNCERTAIN AND

THE EFFECT OF ANY SUCH FUTURE ASBESTOS LEGISLATIVE REFORM ON US WOULD DEPEND

UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE TOTAL SIZE OF ANY COMPENSATION FUND,

THE PORTIONS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS COMMERCIAL GROUPS AND THE FORMULA FOR

ALLOCATING CONTRIBUTIONS AMONG INSURERS. IF ANY ASBESTOS LITIGATION REFORM IS

ENACTED IN THE FUTURE, OUR CONTRIBUTION ALLOCATION COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY

LARGER THAN OUR CURRENT ASBESTOS RESERVE.

OUR ESTIMATE OF LOSSES WAS

BASED ON A VARIETY OF ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES, COVERAGE INTERPRETATION AND CLAIMS

ESTIMATION METHODOLOGIES, AND INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES INCURRED BUT NOT

REPORTED, AS WELL AS ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS. OUR

ESTIMATE OF LOSSES WAS ORIGINALLY BASED ON OUR BELIEF THAT PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURANCE LOSSES FROM THE TERRORIST ATTACK WILL TOTAL BETWEEN $30 BILLION AND

$35 BILLION FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. IN 2003 AND 2002, OUR ESTIMATE OF

ULTIMATE LOSSES WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY OUR ONGOING ANALYSIS OF BOTH PAID AND

REPORTED CLAIMS RELATED TO THE ATTACK. OUR ESTIMATE OF LOSSES REMAINS SUBJECT

TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES AND MAY CHANGE OVER TIME AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

BECOMES AVAILABLE.

WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE

ADEQUACY OF OUR ESTIMATED NET LOSSES RELATED TO THE TERRORIST ATTACK, WEIGHING

ALL FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT THE TOTAL NET LOSSES WE WILL ULTIMATELY INCUR. BASED

ON THE RESULTS OF THOSE REGULAR EVALUATIONS, WE CHANGED OUR ESTIMATE OF LOSSES

AMONG OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY SEGMENTS IN 2003 AND 2002. IN ADDITION, IN 2003 WE

RECORDED A REDUCTION OF $46 MILLION IN ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO THE ATTACK. IN

2002, WE RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL LOSS PROVISION OF $20 MILLION AND A $33 MILLION

REDUCTION IN OUR ESTIMATED PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RELATED TO

THE ATTACK.

IN 2002, WE AND OTHER

INSURERS OBTAINED A SUMMARY JUDGMENT RULING THAT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER

PROPERTY LOSS WAS A SINGLE OCCURRENCE. CERTAIN INSUREDS, INCLUDING THE WORLD

TRADE CENTERS LEASEHOLDER, APPEALED THAT RULING, ASKING THE COURT TO DETERMINE

THAT THE PROPERTY LOSS CONSTITUTED TWO SEPARATE OCCURRENCES RATHER THAN ONE. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE U.S. CIRCUIT

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT RULED THAT UNDER TERMS OF THE POLICY

FORM WE USED TO UNDERWRITE PROPERTY COVERAGE FOR THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, THE

TERRORIST ATTACK CONSTITUTED ONE OCCURRENCE. ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH

SEPARATE LITIGATION, THE AVIATION LOSSES COULD BE DEEMED FOUR SEPARATE EVENTS

RATHER THAN THREE, FOR PURPOSES OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE. EVEN IF

THE COURTS ULTIMATELY RULE AGAINST US REGARDING THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES

OR EVENTS, WE BELIEVE THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED AFTER-TAX LOSSES, NET

OF REINSURANCE, THAT WE WOULD RECORD WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

OFF- BALANCE SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO

CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS IN THE COURSE OF CONDUCTING OUR

INSURANCE OPERATIONS, AND FROM THE SALE OF BUSINESSES.  THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY RELATED TO

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING GUARANTEES, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, OR VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES.  WE HAVE DISCLOSED THE EFFECTS

OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN OUR FOOTNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, SPECIFICALLY NOTES 7, 10, 12 AND 16 INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS

REPORT.  MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE HAD, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A MATERIAL

FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION,

REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR

CAPITAL RESOURCES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES

OVERVIEW

THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC.

IS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH SUBSIDIARIES OPERATING IN THE PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY. WE COMBINE OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS WITH THOSE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND PRESENT THEM ON A CONSOLIDATED

BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SET FORTH IN NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES RELATED TO ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT 1) REQUIRE US TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS

ABOUT HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS AND 2) COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF WE MADE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS. AFTER THE PROPOSED

MERGER, MANAGEMENT OF THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING THE

INTEGRATION OF CLAIMS HANDLING PRACTICES, ACTUARIAL PRACTICES AND OTHER

OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES. THESE DECISIONS MAY IMPACT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF

INSURANCE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES.

LOSS RESERVES

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATE TO OUR RESERVES

FOR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES (LAE). WE

ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR THE ESTIMATED TOTAL UNPAID COST OF LOSSES AND LAE, WHICH

COVER EVENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED. THESE RESERVES REFLECT OUR ESTIMATES

OF THE TOTAL COST OF CLAIMS THAT WERE REPORTED TO US, BUT NOT YET PAID (CASE

RESERVES), AND THE COST OF CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED TO US (IBNR

RESERVES). FOR REPORTED LOSSES, WE ESTABLISH CASE RESERVES WITHIN THE

PARAMETERS OF COVERAGE PROVIDED IN THE INSURANCE POLICY, SURETY BOND OR

REINSURANCE AGREEMENT. FOR IBNR LOSSES, WE ESTIMATE RESERVES TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT VARIOUS STATISTICAL AND ACTUARIAL PROJECTION TECHNIQUES AS WELL AS

OTHER INFLUENCING FACTORS. WE CONTINUALLY REVIEW OUR RESERVES, USING A VARIETY

OF STATISTICAL AND ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES TO ANALYZE CURRENT CLAIM COSTS,

FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY DATA, AND PREVAILING ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND LEGAL FACTORS.

WE ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OTHER VARIABLES SUCH AS PAST LOSS EXPERIENCE,

CHANGES IN LEGISLATIVE CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL

LIABILITY AND POLICY COVERAGES, CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PRACTICES AND

INFLATION. WE CONSIDER NOT ONLY MONETARY INCREASES IN THE COST OF WHAT WE

INSURE, BUT ALSO CHANGES IN SOCIETAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE JURY VERDICTS AND

CASE LAW, OUR APPROACH TO CLAIM RESOLUTION, AND, IN TURN, CLAIM COSTS.

FOR CERTAIN CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE

UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ASSOCIATED ESTIMATED RESERVES FOR

LOSSES AND LAE. RESERVES ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY AND, AS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN, INCLUDING REVISED INDUSTRY ESTIMATES OF

THE MAGNITUDE OF A CATASTROPHE, THE RESERVES ARE ADJUSTED AS WE DEEM NECESSARY.

BECAUSE MANY OF THE COVERAGES WE OFFER INVOLVE CLAIMS

THAT MAY NOT ULTIMATELY BE SETTLED FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THEY ARE INCURRED,

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AS TO OUR ULTIMATE EXPOSURE TO LOSSES ARE AN INTEGRAL AND

NECESSARY COMPONENT OF OUR LOSS RESERVING PROCESS. WE ANALYZE OUR RESERVES BY

CONSIDERING A RANGE OF ESTIMATES BOUNDED BY A HIGH AND LOW POINT, AND RECORD

OUR BEST ESTIMATE WITHIN THAT RANGE. WE ADJUST RESERVES ESTABLISHED IN PRIOR

YEARS AS LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

48

ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUSLY

ESTIMATED RESERVES, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, ARE REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THEY ARE MADE, AND ARE REFERRED TO AS PRIOR

PERIOD DEVELOPMENT. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY INVOLVED IN THESE

ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO OUR ESTIMATED RESERVES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED, AND ULTIMATE ACTUAL

PAYMENTS FOR CLAIMS AND LAE COULD TURN OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM

OUR ESTIMATES.

ENVIRONMENTAL

AND ASBESTOS RESERVES.

RESERVES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS EXPOSURES CANNOT BE ESTIMATED SOLELY WITH THE

TRADITIONAL LOSS RESERVING TECHNIQUES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH RELY ON HISTORICAL

ACCIDENT YEAR DEVELOPMENT FACTORS AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE PREVIOUSLY

MENTIONED VARIABLES. ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS RESERVES ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO

ESTIMATE THAN OUR OTHER LOSS RESERVES BECAUSE OF LEGAL ISSUES, SOCIETAL FACTORS

AND DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE PARTIES WHO MAY ULTIMATELY BE HELD LIABLE. THEREFORE,

IN ADDITION TO TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE TRADITIONAL VARIABLES THAT ARE

UTILIZED TO ARRIVE AT OUR OTHER LOSS RESERVE AMOUNTS, WE ALSO LOOK AT THE

LENGTH OF TIME NECESSARY TO CLEAN UP POLLUTED SITES, CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING

THE IDENTITY OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY, THE DEGREE OF REMEDIATION DEEMED TO BE

NECESSARY, THE ESTIMATED TIME PERIOD FOR LITIGATION EXPENSES, JUDICIAL

EXPANSIONS OF COVERAGE, MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS ARISING WITH ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS

ADVANCED AGE, CASE LAW, AND THE HISTORY OF PRIOR CLAIM DEVELOPMENT. WE ALSO CONSIDER

THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE

WESTERN MACARTHUR MATTER, IN ESTABLISHING OUR RESERVES FOR OTHER ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CASES. GENERALLY, CASE RESERVES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED WHERE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN OBTAINED TO

INDICATE COVERAGE UNDER A SPECIFIC INSURANCE POLICY. WE ALSO CONSIDER END OF

PERIOD RESERVES IN RELATION TO PAID LOSSES IN A PERIOD. FURTHERMORE, IBNR

RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED TO COVER ADDITIONAL ESTIMATED EXPOSURES RELATED TO

POLICYHOLDERS THAT HAVENT AS YET ASSERTED ANY CLAIMS AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT ON

RESERVES ASSUMED FROM OTHER ENTITIES. THESE RESERVES ARE CONTINUALLY REVIEWED

AND UPDATED AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS ACQUIRED.

OUR HISTORICAL METHODOLOGY (THROUGH FIRST QUARTER

2002) FOR REVIEWING THE ADEQUACY OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS RESERVES

UTILIZED A SURVIVAL RATIO METRIC, WHICH CONSIDERED ENDING RESERVES IN RELATION

TO CALENDAR YEAR PAID LOSSES. WHEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE ANALYSES WERE

COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, WE SUPPLEMENTED OUR SURVIVAL RATIO

DIAGNOSTICS WITH THE DETAILED ADDITIONAL ANALYSES REFERRED TO ABOVE, AND

CONCLUDED THAT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES WERE REDUNDANT BY APPROXIMATELY $150

MILLION. BASED ON OUR ADDITIONAL ANALYSES, WE RELEASED APPROXIMATELY $150

MILLION OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002. HAD WE

CONTINUED TO RELY SOLELY ON OUR ANALYSIS OF SURVIVAL RATIO, WE WOULD HAVE

RECORDED NO ADJUSTMENT TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES THROUGH THE SIX MONTHS

ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, WE ALSO SUPPLEMENTED

OUR SURVIVAL RATIO ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS RESERVES WITH A DETAILED CLAIMS

ANALYSIS. WE DETERMINED THAT, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE WESTERN MACARTHUR

SETTLEMENT, OUR ASBESTOS RESERVES WERE ADEQUATE; HOWEVER, INCLUDING THAT

IMPACT, WE DETERMINED THAT OUR ASBESTOS RESERVES WERE INADEQUATE. AS A RESULT,

GROSS AND NET ASBESTOS RESERVES WERE INCREASED $150 MILLION.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE UPDATED OUR DETAILED

ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS FOR BOTH ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES PERTAINING TO

OUR EXPOSURE FROM DIRECT POLICYHOLDERS AND UTILIZED THESE ANALYSES IN

DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVE PROVISION FOR THE REMAINING UNREPORTED

LOSSES. FOR NON-WORKERS COMPENSATION ASBESTOS CLAIMS, WE SUPPLEMENTED THIS

DETAILED ANALYSIS WITH AN ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF

RESERVES SPECIFICALLY FOR POLICYHOLDERS WHO HAVE NOT AS YET TENDERED THEIR

FIRST ASBESTOS CLAIM. AS A RESULT OF THESE STUDIES, WE INCREASED NET ASBESTOS

RESERVES BY $77 MILLION ($44 MILLION IN OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AND $33 MILLION

IN OUR RUNOFF OPERATIONS) AND NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $14 MILLION (ALL IN

OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS). IN ADDITION, REVIEWS OF ASSUMED AND NON-DOMESTIC

EXPOSURES CAUSED US TO INCREASE NET ASBESTOS RESERVES BY $13 MILLION AND REDUCE

NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $1 MILLION (ALL OF WHICH WAS RECORDED IN OUR

RUNOFF OPERATIONS).

HEALTH CARE RESERVES.

DURING 2002, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE

IMPACT OF SETTLING CLAIMS IN A RUNOFF ENVIRONMENT IN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION

WAS CAUSING ABNORMAL EFFECTS ON OUR AVERAGE PAID CLAIMS,

49

AVERAGE OUTSTANDING

CLAIMS, AND THE AMOUNT OF AVERAGE CASE RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR NEW CLAIMS -

ALL OF WHICH ARE TRADITIONAL STATISTICS USED BY OUR ACTUARIES TO DEVELOP

INDICATED RANGES OF EXPECTED LOSS. TAKING THESE CHANGING STATISTICS INTO

ACCOUNT, WE DEVELOPED VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF OUR DATA, WHICH IMPLIED ADDED

UNCERTAINTY IN OUR EVALUATION OF THESE RESERVES.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, WE ESTABLISHED

SPECIFIC TOOLS AND INDICATORS TO MORE EXPLICITLY MONITOR AND VALIDATE OUR KEY

ASSUMPTIONS SUPPORTING OUR HEALTH CARE RESERVE CONCLUSIONS SINCE OUR

TRADITIONAL STATISTICS AND RESERVING METHODS NEEDED TO BE SUPPLEMENTED IN ORDER

TO PROVIDE A MORE MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS. THE TOOLS THAT WERE DEVELOPED TRACKED THE THREE PRIMARY INDICATORS

WHICH INFLUENCED OUR EXPECTATIONS AND INCLUDED: A) NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS, B)

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS AND C) THE REDUNDANCY RATIO, COMPARING

THE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS TO THE RESERVE ESTABLISHED FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL

CLAIM. VARIOUS ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE HEALTH CARE

RESERVES. WHILE CERTAIN ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES COULD SUGGEST A NEED FOR

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESERVES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE TECHNIQUES IT

UTILIZES ARE THE MOST APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION ABOUT LOSS DEVELOPMENT

RELATED TO OUR HEALTH CARE RESERVES IN 2003, REFER TO THE HEALTH CARE SECTION

OF THIS DISCUSSION.

REINSURANCE

OUR REPORTED WRITTEN PREMIUMS, EARNED PREMIUMS AND

LOSSES AND LAE REFLECT THE NET EFFECTS OF ASSUMED AND CEDED REINSURANCE. PREMIUMS

ARE RECORDED AT THE INCEPTION OF EACH POLICY, BASED ON INFORMATION RECEIVED

FROM CEDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BROKERS. FOR EXCESS-OF-LOSS CONTRACTS, THE

AMOUNT OF PREMIUM IS USUALLY CONTRACTUALLY DOCUMENTED AT INCEPTION, AND NO

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS NECESSARY IN ACCOUNTING FOR THIS. PREMIUMS ARE EARNED ON

A PRO RATA BASIS OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD. FOR PROPORTIONAL TREATIES, THE

AMOUNT OF PREMIUM IS NORMALLY ESTIMATED AT INCEPTION BY THE CEDING COMPANY. WE

ACCOUNT FOR SUCH PREMIUM USING THE INITIAL ESTIMATES, AND ADJUST THEM ONCE A

SUFFICIENT PERIOD FOR ACTUAL PREMIUM REPORTING HAS ELAPSED. REINSTATEMENT AND

ADDITIONAL PREMIUMS ARE WRITTEN AT THE TIME A LOSS EVENT OCCURS WHERE COVERAGE

LIMITS FOR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE CONTRACT ARE REINSTATED UNDER PRE-DEFINED

CONTRACT TERMS. REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS ARE THE PREMIUMS CHARGED FOR THE

RESTORATION OF THE REINSURANCE LIMIT OF A CATASTROPHE CONTRACT TO ITS FULL

AMOUNT AFTER PAYMENT BY THE REINSURER OF LOSSES AS A RESULT OF AN OCCURRENCE. THESE

PREMIUMS RELATE TO THE FUTURE COVERAGE OBTAINED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE

INITIAL POLICY TERM, AND ARE EARNED OVER THE REMAINING POLICY TERM. ADDITIONAL

PREMIUMS ARE PREMIUMS CHARGED AFTER COVERAGE HAS EXPIRED THAT ARE RELATED TO

EXPERIENCE DURING THE POLICY TERM, WHICH ARE EARNED IMMEDIATELY.

REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING IS FOLLOWED FOR ASSUMED AND

CEDED TRANSACTIONS WHEN RISK TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET. THESE

REQUIREMENTS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE RELATING TO THE AMOUNT

AND TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS THE INTERPRETATION OF UNDERLYING

CONTRACT TERMS. REINSURANCE CONTRACTS THAT DO NOT TRANSFER SIGNIFICANT

INSURANCE RISK ARE CONSIDERED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND ARE REQUIRED TO BE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS.

WE ESTIMATE AND RECORD AN

ALLOWANCE FOR REINSURANCE AMOUNTS THAT MAY NOT BE COLLECTIBLE, DUE TO CREDIT

ISSUES, DISPUTES OVER COVERAGE, OR OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.

INVESTMENTS

WE

CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF INVESTMENTS, WHICH INVOLVES UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER DECLINES IN

VALUE ARE TEMPORARY IN NATURE. IF WE BELIEVE A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF A

PARTICULAR INVESTMENT IS TEMPORARY, WE RECORD THE DECLINE AS AN UNREALIZED LOSS

IN OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IF WE BELIEVE THE DECLINE IS OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY, WE WRITE DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT AND RECORD A

REALIZED LOSS ON OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. OUR ASSESSMENT OF A DECLINE IN

VALUE INCLUDES OUR CURRENT JUDGMENT AS TO THE FINANCIAL POSITION AND FUTURE

PROSPECTS OF THE ENTITY THAT ISSUED THE INVESTMENT SECURITY. IF THAT JUDGMENT

CHANGES IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECORD A REALIZED LOSS AFTER HAVING ORIGINALLY

CONCLUDED THAT THE DECLINE IN VALUE WAS TEMPORARY. THE FOLLOWING

50

TABLE SUMMARIZES THE TOTAL PRETAX GROSS UNREALIZED

LOSS RECORDED IN OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

IN OUR VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO, THE SALE OF A LARGE

PORTION OF ONE OF OUR INVESTMENT HOLDINGS GENERATED A PRETAX GAIN OF $171

MILLION IN 2003, WHICH WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY IMPAIRMENT REALIZED LOSSES

TOTALING $143 MILLION RELATED TO 38 OF OUR INVESTMENT HOLDINGS. FOURTEEN OF

THOSE HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO A MERGER OR SALE AT A VALUE LESS THAN OUR

COST. ELEVEN HOLDINGS EXPERIENCED FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC DETERIORATION

(CHARACTERIZED BY GROSS MARGINS BEING LESS THAN EXPECTED, PRODUCT PRICING NOT

MEETING INITIAL PROJECTIONS DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS, AND GREATER THAN EXPECTED

MANUFACTURING EXPENSES). SIX HOLDINGS

52

WERE WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE

THE ENTITIES PROGRESS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN PLANNED AND ADDITIONAL

FINANCING WAS REQUIRED AT VALUES LESS THAN OUR COST. AN ADDITIONAL SIX HOLDINGS

WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO CESSATION OF OPERATIONS OF THE ENTITY. FINALLY, ONE

HOLDING WAS IMPAIRED BECAUSE MARKET DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCT WAS LESS THAN

EXPECTED.

REALIZED LOSSES IN OUR VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO IN

2002 INCLUDED $56 MILLION OF LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF THE MAJORITY OF

OUR PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENT HOLDINGS, AND IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS IN 25 OF OUR

HOLDINGS TOTALING $122 MILLION. THESE HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED FOR THE SAME

GENERAL REASONS NOTED ABOVE FOR THE 2003 IMPAIRMENTS: SEVEN HOLDINGS WERE

IMPAIRED BECAUSE MARKET DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS WAS LESS THAN EXPECTED; SEVEN

HOLDINGS WERE WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE THE ENTITIES PROGRESS WAS LESS THAN PLANNED

AND ADDITIONAL FINANCING WOULD BE REQUIRED; FIVE HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO

FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC DETERIORATION (AS DEFINED ABOVE); FOUR HOLDINGS WERE

IMPAIRED DUE TO A MERGER OR SALE AT LESS THAN OUR COST; AND TWO HOLDINGS WERE

IMPAIRED DUE TO CESSATION OF OPERATIONS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, NON-INVESTMENT GRADE

SECURITIES COMPRISED LESS THAN 2% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO, AND NONRATED SECURITIES COMPRISED LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT

OF THAT PORTFOLIO. INCLUDED IN THOSE CATEGORIES AT THAT DATE WERE SECURITIES IN

AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION THAT, IN THE AGGREGATE, HAD AN AMORTIZED COST OF

$59 MILLION AND A FAIR VALUE OF $56 MILLION, RESULTING IN A NET PRETAX

UNREALIZED LOSS OF $3 MILLION. THESE SECURITIES REPRESENTED LESS THAN 1% OF THE

TOTAL AMORTIZED COST AND FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, AND ACCOUNTED FOR 6% OF THE TOTAL PRETAX UNREALIZED LOSS IN THE FIXED

INCOME PORTFOLIO. INCLUDED IN THOSE CATEGORIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 WERE

SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION THAT, IN THE AGGREGATE, HAD AN

AMORTIZED COST OF $160 MILLION AND A FAIR VALUE OF $140 MILLION, RESULTING IN A

NET PRETAX UNREALIZED LOSS OF $20 MILLION. THESE SECURITIES REPRESENTED 1% OF

THE TOTAL AMORTIZED COST AND FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO AT DEC. 31,

2002, AND ACCOUNTED FOR 38% OF THE TOTAL PRETAX UNREALIZED LOSS IN THE FIXED

INCOME PORTFOLIO.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDES NON-PUBLICLY

TRADED SECURITIES, THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE HELD IN OUR VENTURE CAPITAL

AND REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS. OUR VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS REPRESENT OWNERSHIP

INTERESTS IN SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES, WHICH ARE CARRIED AT ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE BASED ON AN ESTIMATE DETERMINED BY AN INTERNAL VALUATION

COMMITTEE FOR SECURITIES FOR WHICH THERE IS NO PUBLIC MARKET. THE INTERNAL

VALUATION COMMITTEE REVIEWS SUCH FACTORS AS RECENT FINANCINGS, OPERATING

RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH, AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR

FUNDAMENTAL STATISTICS IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUES OF SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS. FOR

OUR REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES, WE USE THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, MEANING

THAT WE CARRY THESE INVESTMENTS AT COST, ADJUSTED FOR OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR

LOSSES, AND REDUCED BY CASH DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PARTNERSHIPS AND VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS. DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS IN OBTAINING FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM THE

PARTNERSHIPS, THE RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ARE RECORDED

53

ON A ONE-MONTH LAG. IF

EVENTS OCCUR DURING THE LAG PERIOD WHICH ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS, THE IMPACT IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SUMMARIZES OUR PROCESS OF

REVIEWING OUR INVESTMENTS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT.

FIXED INCOME AND

SECURITIES ON LOAN



ON

A MONTHLY BASIS, THESE INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED BY PORTFOLIO MANAGERS FOR

IMPAIRMENT. IN GENERAL, THE MANAGERS FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON THOSE FIXED

INCOME SECURITIES WHOSE MARKET VALUE WAS LESS THAN 80% OF THEIR AMORTIZED COST

FOR AT LEAST ONE MONTH IN THE PREVIOUS NINE MONTHS. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN

EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

·

THE

DEGREE TO WHICH ANY APPEARANCE OF IMPAIRMENT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN OVERALL

CHANGE IN MARKET CONDITIONS (E.G., INTEREST RATES) RATHER THAN CHANGES IN THE

INDIVIDUAL FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND RISK PROFILE OF THE ISSUER;

·

THE

DEGREE TO WHICH AN ISSUER IS CURRENT OR IN ARREARS IN MAKING PRINCIPAL AND

INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT SECURITIES IN QUESTION;

·

THE

ISSUERS FIXED-CHARGE RATIO AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AND DATE OF EVALUATION;

·

ON A MONTHLY BASIS, THESE INVESTMENTS ARE

REVIEWED BY PORTFOLIO MANAGERS FOR IMPAIRMENT. IN GENERAL, THE MANAGERS FOCUS

THEIR ATTENTION ON THOSE EQUITY SECURITIES WHOSE MARKET VALUE WAS LESS THAN 80%

OF THEIR COST FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE MONTHS. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

·

WHETHER

THE DECLINE APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO GENERAL MARKET OR INDUSTRY CONDITIONS OR

IS ISSUER-SPECIFIC;

·

THE

VENTURE CAPITAL

PUBLICLY

TRADED.

ON A MONTHLY BASIS, INDIVIDUAL PUBLIC

INVESTMENTS ARE ANALYZED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AS WELL AS AN

INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE. IN GENERAL, ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON THOSE

MARKETABLE (PUBLIC EQUITY) SECURITIES WHOSE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN

COST FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE MONTHS. FACTORS CONSIDERED ARE THE SAME AS THOSE

ENUMERATED ABOVE FOR OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

NON-PUBLICLY TRADED

OUR NON-PUBLICLY TRADED

VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO GENERALLY CONSISTS OF INVESTMENTS IN EARLY-STAGE

VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES, HISTORICALLY WITH A HOLDING PERIOD OF FOUR TO SEVEN

YEARS. THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN MADE IN THE HEALTH CARE, SOFTWARE

AND COMPUTER SERVICES, AND NETWORKING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES

INFRASTRUCTURES INDUSTRIES. WE TYPICALLY ARE INVOLVED WITH VENTURE CAPITAL

COMPANIES EARLY IN THEIR FORMATION, AS THEY ARE DEVELOPING AND DETERMINING THE

VIABILITY OF, AND MARKET DEMAND FOR, THEIR PRODUCT. WE GENERALLY DO NOT EXPECT

THESE VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES TO RECORD REVENUES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THEIR

DEVELOPMENT, WHICH CAN OFTEN TAKE THREE TO FOUR YEARS, AND DO NOT GENERALLY

EXPECT THEM TO BECOME PROFITABLE FOR AN EVEN LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. AS SUCH,

OUR IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS FOR THESE NON-PUBLICLY TRADED VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS DIFFERS FROM THAT PERFORMED FOR BOTH OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND OUR PUBLICLY-TRADED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. WITH

RESPECT TO OUR VALUATION OF SUCH NON-PUBLICLY TRADED VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AS WELL AS THE

INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE REVIEW AND CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN

DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS IMPAIRMENT. FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING.

·

THE

ISSUERS MOST RECENT FINANCING EVENTS;

·

AN

ANALYSIS OF WHETHER FUNDAMENTAL DETERIORATION HAS OCCURRED;

·

WHETHER

OR NOT THE ISSUERS PROGRESS HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN EXPECTED;

·

WHETHER

OR NOT THE VALUATIONS HAVE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE ENTITYS MARKET

SECTOR;

·

WHETHER

OR NOT THE INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE BELIEVES THERE IS A 50% PROBABILITY

THAT THE ISSUER WILL NEED FINANCING WITHIN SIX MONTHS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN OUR

CARRYING VALUE; AND

·

WHETHER

OR NOT WE HAVE THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME

SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY, ENABLING US TO RECEIVE VALUE EQUAL TO OR

GREATER THAN OUR COST.

THE QUARTERLY (OR MONTHLY) VALUATION PROCEDURES

DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ONGOING

RESPONSIBILITY TO FREQUENTLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THOSE INVESTED

ASSETS, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EVENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO

IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS.

THE SIZE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ALLOWS OUR

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS A DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN DETERMINING WHICH INDIVIDUAL

INVESTMENTS SHOULD BE SOLD TO ACHIEVE OUR PRIMARY INVESTMENT GOALS OF ASSURING

OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER CREDITORS AND

MAXIMIZING OUR INVESTMENT RETURNS. IN ORDER TO MEET THE OBJECTIVE OF

MAINTAINING A FLEXIBLE PORTFOLIO THAT CAN ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, OUR FIXED INCOME

AND EQUITY PORTFOLIOS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. WE CONTINUALLY

EVALUATE THESE PORTFOLIOS, AND OUR PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS ARE BASED

ON OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AND

CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. AT THE TIME WE DETERMINE AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT IN THE VALUE OF A PARTICULAR INVESTMENT TO HAVE OCCURRED, WE

CONSIDER THE CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAKE A DECISION TO EITHER

RECORD A WRITE-DOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SECURITY OR SELL THE SECURITY;

IN EITHER CASE, RECOGNIZING A REALIZED LOSS.

WITH RESPECT TO OUR

VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO, WE MANAGE OUR PORTFOLIO TO MAXIMIZE RETURN,

EVALUATING CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR THE ENTITIES IN

WHICH WE HAVE INVESTED. BECAUSE THIS PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF

PRIVATELY-HELD, EARLY-STAGE VENTURE INVESTMENTS, EVENTS GIVING RISE TO

55

IMPAIRMENT

CAN OCCUR IN A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME (E.G., THE ENTITY HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN

SECURING ADDITIONAL FINANCING, OTHER INVESTORS DECIDE TO WITHDRAW THEIR

SUPPORT, COMPLICATIONS ARISE IN THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, ETC.), AND

DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THAT POINT IN TIME, BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES, WITH RESPECT TO A RECOGNITION OF OTHER THAN TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT, OR SALE OF THE INVESTMENT.

ADOPTION OF

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

FASB STAFF POSITION NO. FAS 106-1ON

JANUARY 12, 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FASB

STAFF POSITION NO. FAS 106-1, 

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

(FSP 106-1).

THIS PRONOUNCEMENT PROVIDES COMPANIES WITH THE OPTION TO MAKE A ONE-TIME

ELECTION TO DEFER ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICARE ACT REFERENCED IN

ITS TITLE (THE ACT).  WE HAVE DECIDED

TO DEFER ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACT UNDER FSP 106-1 AND HAVE MADE THE REQUIRED

DISCLOSURES IN NOTE 13RETIREMENT PLANS TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.  THE FINAL ACCOUNTING

GUIDANCE COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED INFORMATION.  WE WILL MONITOR THE FASB DELIBERATIONS AND

ACCOUNT FOR THE ACT BASED ON THE PRONOUNCEMENT EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED.

FIN

46(R)

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES,

WHICH WAS REPLACED IN DECEMBER 2003 (FIN 46(R)). FIN 46(R), ALONG WITH

ITS RELATED INTERPRETATIONS, REQUIRES CONSOLIDATION OF ALL VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES (VIE) BY THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, AS THESE TERMS ARE DEFINED IN

FIN 46(R). WE BEGAN APPLYING THE CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW VIES IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. FOR VIES CREATED

BEFORE

JANUARY 31, 2003, THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ADOPTION WAS DEFERRED UNTIL THE

FIRST INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIOD ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2003 (FOR US, THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2004), BUT EARLY AND PARTIAL ADOPTION WERE PERMITTED.

WE CHOSE TO PARTIALLY ADOPT FIN 46(R) UNDER THE EARLY

ADOPTION PROVISIONS IN 2003, WHICH RESULTED IN US CONSOLIDATING CERTAIN

ENTITIES (SUMMARIZED BELOW) THAT WE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED. WE ARE

STILL EVALUATING THE IMPLICATIONS OF FIN 46(R) ON OUR PARTICIPATION IN VARIOUS

LLOYDS UNDERWRITING SYNDICATES. UPON PARTIAL ADOPTION, WE RECORDED A LOSS OF

$21 MILLION (NET OF A DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT OF $3 MILLION) IN OUR CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN 2003, CLASSIFIED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ACCOUNTING CHANGE AND REPRESENTING THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF FIN 46(R) ON

PERIODS PRIOR TO THE JULY 1, 2003 DATE OF PARTIAL ADOPTION.

THE ENTITIES THAT

WE CONSOLIDATED (OR DECONSOLIDATED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF

TRUSTS) UNDER OUR PARTIAL ADOPTION OF FIN 46(R) WERE AS FOLLOWS.

·

INVESTMENT

WE HOLD AN INVESTMENT IN AN

INSURANCE COMPANY THAT PROVIDES INSURANCE COVERAGE TO MARKETS IN BALTIMORE AND

WASHINGTON D.C. OUR INVESTMENT INCLUDES A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, BUT NONE OF ITS VOTING COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT

OF OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE ENTITY, WE HAVE THE MAJORITY EXPOSURE TO

VARIABILITY THROUGH OUR PREFERRED STOCK OWNERSHIP AND A LOAN TO THE COMPANY,

BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED VARIABLE INTERESTS AS DEFINED IN FIN 46(R). ACCORDINGLY,

WE BEGAN CONSOLIDATING THIS ENTITY IN THE THIRD QUARTER. THE CARRYING VALUE OF

THIS INVESTMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION.

·

MUNICIPAL TRUSTS

WE OWN INTERESTS IN

VARIOUS MUNICIPAL TRUSTS THAT WERE FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ALLOWING US TO

MORE FLEXIBLY GENERATE INVESTMENT INCOME IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH OUR

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND TAX POSITION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THERE

WERE 36 SUCH TRUSTS, WHICH HELD A COMBINED TOTAL OF $450 MILLION IN MUNICIPAL

SECURITIES, OF WHICH EIGHT HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS PRIOR TO OUR ADOPTION OF FIN 46(R) BECAUSE WE DID NOT HOLD MAJORITY

OWNERSHIP IN THEM. HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE THE MAJORITY EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY FOR

THESE TRUSTS. THEREFORE, WE CONSOLIDATED THESE EIGHT TRUSTS IN 2003. THE

COMBINED CARRYING VALUE OF THESE TRUSTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS $366

MILLION.

56

·

VENTURE CAPITAL ENTITIES

IN OUR VENTURE

CAPITAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, WE HAVE NUMEROUS INVESTMENTS IN SMALL- TO

MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES, IN WHICH WE HAVE VARIABLE INTERESTS THROUGH STOCK

OWNERSHIP AND, IN SOME CASES, LOANS. ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE HELD FOR THE

PURPOSE OF GENERATING INVESTMENT RETURNS, AND THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST

SPAN A VARIETY OF BUSINESS SECTORS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS

AND HEALTHCARE. AS A RESULT OF OUR REVIEW OF THIS PORTFOLIO, WE IDENTIFIED

THREE ENTITIES THAT WERE REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF

FIN 46(R). THE COMBINED CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ENTITIES AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 WAS $(5) MILLION.

·

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF TRUSTS

HOLDING SOLELY SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES OF THE COMPANY

(PREFERRED

SECURITIES)THESE SECURITIES HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF $897 MILLION, AND PRIOR

TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 WERE CLASSIFIED AS A SEPARATE LINE ON OUR BALANCE

SHEET BETWEEN LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THESE SECURITIES WERE

ISSUED BY FIVE SEPARATE TRUSTS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF

ISSUING THE SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, AND THE SECURITIES WERE FULLY GUARANTEED

BY US. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, WE RECLASSIFIED THESE SECURITIES TO DEBT

IN THE LIABILITY SECTION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AS NEWLY REQUIRED

UNDER STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 150, ACCOUNTING

FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND

EQUITY, WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRED THAT AN ISSUER CLASSIFY A FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT THAT IS WITHIN ITS SCOPE AS A LIABILITY (OR AN ASSET IN SOME

CIRCUMSTANCES). IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE DETERMINED THAT THE

PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R) APPLIED TO THE TRUSTS THAT ISSUED THESE SECURITIES, AND

AS A RESULT WE DECONSOLIDATED THE TRUSTS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. THE

DEBT WE ISSUED TO THESE TRUSTS, PREVIOUSLY ELIMINATED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, IS NOW INCLUDED IN THE DEBT SECTION OF LIABILITIES ON

OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE NET IMPACT OF DE-CONSOLIDATING THESE TRUSTS

WAS TO INCREASE OUR REPORTED DEBT LIABILITIES OUTSTANDING BY $928 MILLION AND

ELIMINATE THE $897 MILLION OF PREFERRED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUSTS FROM

OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AMOUNTS WAS

COMPRISED OF THE $31 MILLION COMBINED EQUITY INTERESTS WE HELD IN THE

DECONSOLIDATED TRUSTS.

THE

CONSOLIDATION/DECONSOLIDATION OF THE FOREGOING ENTITIES HAD THE NET IMPACT OF

INCREASING (DECREASING) THE BALANCE SHEET AND STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS CAPTIONS

IN ADDITION TO THE

FOREGOING ENTITIES THAT WERE CONSOLIDATED PURSUANT TO FIN 46(R), WE ALSO HOLD

SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN OTHER VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT

CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, AS FOLLOWS.

·

WE

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTEREST IN TWO REAL ESTATE ENTITIES, BUT WE ARE

NOT CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE OF THESE

ENTITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $48 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, WHICH

ALSO REPRESENTS OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS. THE PURPOSE OF OUR INVOLVEMENT IN

THESE ENTITIES IS TO GENERATE INVESTMENT RETURNS.

57

·

WE

ALSO HAVE CERTAIN REMAINING VARIABLE INTERESTS IN CAMPERDOWN UK LIMITED, AN

ENTITY THAT WE SOLD IN 2003. WE UTILIZED THIS ENTITY AS ONE OF OUR CORPORATE

NAMES AND THE VEHICLE FOR OUR PARTICIPATION AT LLOYDS FOR 2003 AND PRIOR YEARS

OF ACCOUNT THROUGH A SINGLE SYNDICATE (SYNDICATE 5000). OUR VARIABLE INTEREST

RESULTS FROM AN AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER IN THE EVENT A SPECIFIED

RESERVE DEFICIENCY DEVELOPS, A RESERVE-RELATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACT OCCURS,

OR A FOREIGN TAX ADJUSTMENT IS IMPOSED ON A PRE-SALE REPORTING PERIOD. THE

MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THIS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION IS $203 MILLION. IN ADDITION,

IN 2003 WE ENTERED INTO A 100% QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH SYNDICATE

5000 THAT IN EFFECT TRANSFERRED SYNDICATE 5000S UNDERWRITING RESULTS FOR THE

2003 YEAR OF ACCOUNT TO US.

SFAS NO.

150

AS NOTED

ABOVE, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 150 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2003 WITH RESPECT TO OUR PREFERRED SECURITIES, OUR ONLY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THAT FELL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SFAS NO. 150. UPON THE APPLICATION OF THE

PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R) IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 TO TRUSTS THAT ISSUED

THESE SECURITIES, WE NO LONGER HAVE ANY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO WHICH SFAS NO. 150

APPLIES.

SFAS NO.

141

IN 2002, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WHICH ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. (NUVEEN INVESTMENTS HAD APPLIED THE

RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THIS STATEMENT TO ITS 2001 ACQUISITION OF SYMPHONY ASSET

MANAGEMENT LLC). THE STATEMENT REQUIRES ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED

SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30, 2001 TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING. IN ADDITION, THIS STATEMENT REQUIRED THAT INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT

CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA BE RECOGNIZED AS ASSETS APART FROM

GOODWILL.

SFAS NO.

142

IN 2002, WE IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

AND REPORTING FOR ACQUIRED GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE STATEMENT

CHANGED PRIOR ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE METHOD BY WHICH

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES, INCLUDING GOODWILL, ARE TESTED

FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IT ALSO REQUIRED THAT THOSE ASSETS MEETING

THE CRITERIA FOR CLASSIFICATION AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE USEFUL LIVES

BE AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THOSE LIVES, WHILE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES AND GOODWILL ARE NOT TO BE AMORTIZED. AS A RESULT OF

IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS OF THIS STATEMENT, WE DID NOT RECORD ANY GOODWILL

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN 2003 OR 2002. IN 2001, GOODWILL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE

TOTALED $114 MILLION. AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH INTANGIBLE ASSETS

TOTALED $31 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $18 MILLION IN 2002 AND $2 MILLION

2001.

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN

ASSETS PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS GOODWILL TO OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS UPON OUR

ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 142 IN 2002, WE ESTABLISHED A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY

OF $6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002. THAT PROVISION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142, WE RESTATED OUR RESULTS FOR THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2002, REDUCING NET INCOME FOR THAT PERIOD FROM THE REPORTED $139

MILLION, OR $0.63 PER COMMON SHARE (DILUTED) TO $133 MILLION, OR $0.60 PER

COMMON SHARE (DILUTED).

SFAS NO.

144

DURING 2002, WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS

NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. AS A RESULT OF

IMPLEMENTATION, WE MONITOR THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE VALUE OF OUR LONG-LIVED

ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS

(UNDISCOUNTED AND WITHOUT INTEREST CHARGES) EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF

EACH ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION CONSIDERING ANY EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE. WE MONITOR THE VALUE OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF

AND REPORT THEM AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR FAIR VALUE LESS OUR ESTIMATED

COST TO SELL. WE HAD NO IMPAIRMENT ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS

IN 2002.

SFAS NO.

133

ON JANUARY 1, 2001, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS

NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

AS AMENDED BY SFAS NOS. 137 AND 138. PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 133 REQUIRE

THE RECOGNITION OF DERIVATIVES AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE

SHEET AND

58

THE MEASUREMENT OF

THOSE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE. WE HAVE LIMITED INVOLVEMENT WITH DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY FOR PURPOSES OF HEDGING AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET

INDICES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. WE ALSO HAVE

ENTERED INTO A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONSIDERED TO BE

DERIVATIVES, BUT WHICH ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, THAT WE UTILIZE TO

MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF MARKET MOVEMENTS IN CERTAIN INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIOS. OUR ADOPTION OF SFAS NO 133, AS AMENDED, DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003,

OUR GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TOTALED $1.07 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.01

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT SUBSIDIARY, NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS, INC., ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE $52 MILLION INCREASE,

PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM ADDITIONAL GOODWILL RECORDED AT THE ST. PAUL PARENT

COMPANY RESULTING FROM NUVEEN INVESTMENTS REPURCHASE OF COMMON SHARES FROM ITS

MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS. OUR ACQUISITION OF THE RIGHT TO RENEW CERTAIN BUSINESS

FROM KEMPER INSURANCE COMPANY IN 2003 ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER 2002. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, WE

COMPLETED THE ANNUAL EVALUATION OF OUR RECORDED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 142. THAT EVALUATION CONCLUDED THAT

NONE OF OUR GOODWILL WAS IMPAIRED. SEE NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT FOR A SCHEDULE OF GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

ELIMINATION OF

ONE-QUARTER REPORTING LAGS

IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, WE ELIMINATED THE ONE-QUARTER REPORTING LAG FOR OUR

UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS TO COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF REPORTING FOR

ALL OF OUR OTHER INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, OUR CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS FOR 2003 INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF THOSE OPERATIONS FOR THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2002 AND ALL QUARTERS OF 2003. THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT ON OUR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONS OF ELIMINATING THE REPORTING LAG, CONSISTING OF

THE RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2003, WAS AS FOLLOWS.

RECLASSIFICATION OF

LLOYDS COMMISSION EXPENSES

IN 2003, WE RECLASSIFIED

CERTAIN COMMISSION EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS. IN PRIOR

YEARS, WE DETERMINED COMMISSION EXPENSE BASED ON PREMIUMS REPORTED BY THE LLOYDS

MARKET (NET OF COMMISSIONS) USING AN ESTIMATED AVERAGE COMMISSION RATE. UNTIL

RECENTLY, GROSS PREMIUMS (PRIOR TO REDUCTION FOR COMMISSIONS) WERE NOT READILY

AVAILABLE FROM THE LLOYDS MARKET. IN 2003, WE BEGAN RECORDING ACTUAL

COMMISSION EXPENSE FOR OUR LLOYDS BUSINESS. WE RECLASSIFIED PRIOR PERIOD

RESULTS TO RECORD ACTUAL COMMISSION EXPENSE ON A BASIS CONSISTENT WITH THAT

IMPLEMENTED IN 2003. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO NET INCOME OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FOR ANY PRIOR PERIODS, BECAUSE THE RECLASSIFICATION HAD

THE IMPACT OF INCREASING PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PREMIUMS AND COMMISSION EXPENSE IN

EQUAL AND OFFSETTING AMOUNTS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, THIS

RECLASSIFICATION HAD THE IMPACT OF INCREASING BOTH NET EARNED PREMIUMS AND

POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS BY $81 MILLION COMPARED WITH WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

RECORDED UNDER OUR PRIOR METHOD OF ESTIMATION. IN ADDITION, NET WRITTEN

PREMIUMS INCREASED BY $116 MILLION IN 2003 (A PORTION OF WHICH WAS DUE TO THE

ELIMINATION OF THE ONE-QUARTER REPORTING LAG). FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2002, THE IMPACT WAS AN INCREASE TO BOTH NET EARNED PREMIUMS AND POLICY

ACQUISITION COSTS OF $112 MILLION AND AN INCREASE TO NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF

$91 MILLION. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE IMPACT WAS AN

INCREASE TO BOTH NET EARNED PREMIUMS AND POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS OF $112

MILLION AND AN INCREASE TO NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $132 MILLION.

PRESENTATION OF

CERTAIN INFORMATION BASED ON STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

OUR U.S.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OPERATIONS COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF OUR BUSINESS. THESE

OPERATIONS ARE REQUIRED UNDER APPLICABLE STATE INSURANCE LEGISLATION AND

REGULATIONS TO PUBLICLY REPORT INFORMATION ON THE BASIS OF STATUTORY ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES (SAP), INCLUDING NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS, STATUTORY LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO, AND STATUTORY UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO INFORMATION.

WE PROVIDE IN THIS REPORT SELECTED SAP INFORMATION FOR ALL OF OUR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN GAAP INFORMATION

FOR SUCH OPERATIONS. THE TYPES OF SAP INFORMATION INCLUDED HEREIN ARE COMMON

MEASURES OF THE PERFORMANCE OF A PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURER, AND WE BELIEVE THE

INCLUSION OF SUCH INFORMATION WILL AID INVESTORS IN COMPARING OUR RESULTS WITH

THOSE OF OUR PEERS IN THE INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT USES THIS SAP

INFORMATION TO MONITOR OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. DEFINITIONS OF THE STATUTORY

INFORMATION INCLUDED HEREIN ARE INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING TERMS SECTION OF THIS DISCUSSION.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY

OPERATIONS

UNDERWRITING RESULTS BY SEGMENT

UNDERWRITING RESULT

IS

A COMMON MEASUREMENT OF A PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURERS PERFORMANCE,

REPRESENTING EARNED PREMIUMS LESS LOSSES INCURRED AND UNDERWRITING EXPENSES. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF

AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, WE HAVE DESIGNATED UNDERWRITING RESULT

AS THE MEASURE WE USE TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY

UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS. THE

STATUTORY

COMBINED RATIO

, REPRESENTING THE SUM OF THE STATUTORY LOSS RATIO AND

THE STATUTORY EXPENSE RATIO, IS ALSO A COMMON MEASURE OF UNDERWRITING

PERFORMANCE. THE

STATUTORY

LOSS RATIO

MEASURES INSURANCE LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES INCURRED AS A PERCENTAGE OF EARNED PREMIUMS. THE

STATUTORY

EXPENSE

RATIO

MEASURES UNDERWRITING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUMS

WRITTEN. THE LOWER THE RATIO, THE BETTER THE RESULT. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

SUMMARIZES NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS, UNDERWRITING RESULTS AND COMBINED RATIOS FOR

EACH OF OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR THE LAST

THREE YEARS (UNDERWRITING RESULTS ARE PRESENTED ON A GAAP BASIS; COMBINED

RATIOS ARE PRESENTED ON A STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS). ALL DATA FOR 2002 AND

2001 WERE RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO OUR NEW SEGMENT REPORTING FORMAT

IMPLEMENTED IN 2003. FOLLOWING THE TABLE ARE AN OVERVIEW OF OUR

IN DISCUSSIONS THAT

FOLLOW, WE SOMETIMES USE THE TERM PRIOR-YEAR LOSS DEVELOPMENT, WHICH REFERS

TO THE INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND LAE

IN A GIVEN YEAR FOR CLAIMS INCURRED IN PERIODS PRIOR TO THE YEAR OF THE INCOME

STATEMENT IMPACT. SIMILARLY, WE SOMETIMES REFER TO CURRENT-YEAR LOSS

DEVELOPMENT OR CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR LOSS ACTIVITY, WHICH REFERS TO THE

INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF RECORDING THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND LAE IN A

GIVEN YEAR FOR LOSSES INCURRED IN THAT YEAR.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OVERVIEW

AS DESCRIBED EARLIER IN THIS DISCUSSION, WE REVISED

OUR SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE IN 2003. OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS ARE REPORTED IN

TWO SEGMENTS

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

AND

COMMERCIAL LINES.

THOSE OPERATIONS WHICH

ARE IN RUNOFF ARE REPORTED IN THE

OTHER

SEGMENT.

PREMIUM GROWTH OF 24% IN OUR ONGOING

SEGMENTS IN 2003 WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS, PRICE

INCREASES, AS WELL AS NEW BUSINESS (INCLUDING PREMIUM VOLUME RESULTING FROM OUR

ACQUISITION OF THE RIGHT TO RENEW CERTAIN BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY

61

UNDERWRITTEN BY THE KEMPER

INSURANCE COMPANIES). BOTH ONGOING SEGMENTS RECORDED STRONG PREMIUM INCREASES

IN 2002 OVER 2001, WITH THE MOST NOTABLE GROWTH OCCURRING IN OUR SURETY AND

CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS (PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG PRICE INCREASES IN

CONSTRUCTION, AS WELL AS ACQUISITION-RELATED PREMIUM GROWTH IN SURETY), AND IN

THE SPECIALTY CATEGORY OF THE SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT (DUE TO SIGNIFICANT

PRICE INCREASES AND NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESS CENTERS

COMPRISING THAT CATEGORY). OUR CONSOLIDATED NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2001

INCLUDED A REDUCTION OF $128 MILLION FOR PREMIUMS CEDED UNDER SPECIFIC

REINSURANCE TREATIES DESCRIBED BELOW.

NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME OF $215 MILLION IN OUR

RUNOFF SEGMENT IN 2003 CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF PRIOR-YEAR PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS IN

OUR REINSURANCE OPERATIONS AND REPORTING ENDORSEMENTS (AS DEFINED IN THE HEALTH

CARE SECTION OF THIS REPORT) IN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION. IN OUR RUNOFF

SEGMENT, 2002 PREMIUMS OF $1.21 BILLION WERE 60% BELOW THE 2001 TOTAL OF $3.03

BILLION, REFLECTING OUR DECISION AT THE END OF 2001 TO EXIT THOSE LINES OF

BUSINESS.

THE STRONG IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERWRITING RESULTS IN OUR

ONGOING SEGMENTS IN BOTH 2003 AND 2002 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT

PRICE INCREASES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR EFFORTS TO

IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR BOOK OF BUSINESS. OUR ONGOING SEGMENTS UNDERWRITING

RESULTS IN 2001 INCLUDED $279 MILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11,

2001 TERRORIST ATTACK.

THE UNDERWRITING LOSS FOR OUR RUNOFF SEGMENT IN 2003

INCLUDED A $350 MILLION PROVISION TO STRENGTHEN PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES IN OUR

HEALTH CARE OPERATION, AND ADDITIONAL PRIOR-YEAR PROVISIONS TOTALING $260

MILLION IN CERTAIN OTHER OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN

THE OTHER SECTION OF THIS DISCUSSION. IN 2002, THE UNDERWRITING LOSS FOR OUR

RUNOFF SEGMENT INCLUDED A $472 MILLION PRETAX LOSS RELATED TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR

ASBESTOS LITIGATION SETTLEMENT, AND SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS TO STRENGTHEN

PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES IN CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF. IN 2001, THE

$1.87 BILLION UNDERWRITING LOSS IN OUR RUNOFF SEGMENT WAS DRIVEN BY THE $735

MILLION OF PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES IN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION, AND $662

MILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO THE TERRORIST ATTACK.

OUR ONGOING SEGMENTS EXPENSE RATIOS IMPROVED IN BOTH

2003 AND 2002, REFLECTING THE COMBINED EFFECT OF SIGNIFICANT PREMIUM GROWTH IN

BOTH YEARS, AS WELL AS EFFICIENCIES REALIZED THROUGHOUT OUR UNDERWRITING

OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPENSE REDUCTION INITIATIVES OVER THE LAST THREE

YEARS. THE MAGNITUDE OF IMPROVEMENT IN 2002 OVER 2001 WAS MITIGATED SOMEWHAT BY

THE IMPACT OF WRITTEN PREMIUMS CEDED FOR TERRORISM COVERAGE. EXPENSE REDUCTION

EFFORTS IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDED THE CONSOLIDATION OF FIELD OFFICE LOCATIONS,

THE STREAMLINING OF OUR CLAIM ORGANIZATION, THE RESTRUCTURING OF SEVERAL OF OUR

BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AND THE COMBINED ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 1,200 EMPLOYEE

POSITIONS SINCE OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2001. AS A

RESULT OF THOSE AND OTHER EXPENSE MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES, WE WERE ABLE TO

REDUCE OUR FIXED EXPENSES IN BOTH 2003 AND 2002.

REINSURANCE

TREATIES.

IN

2001, WE ENTERED INTO TWO AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATIES. UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE REINSURANCE TREATIES, WE TRANSFERRED, OR CEDED, INSURANCE

LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO OUR REINSURERS, ALONG WITH THE RELATED

WRITTEN AND EARNED PREMIUMS. ONE OF THESE TREATIES WAS CORPORATE-WIDE, WITH

COVERAGE TRIGGERED WHEN OUR INSURANCE LOSSES AND LAE ACROSS ALL LINES OF

BUSINESS REACHED A CERTAIN LEVEL, AS PRESCRIBED BY TERMS OF THE TREATY. WE DID

NOT CEDE ANY LOSSES TO THE CORPORATE TREATY IN 2001, BUT WE RECORDED A $34

MILLION NET DETRIMENT IN 2001 RELATED TO A SIMILAR TREATY WE WERE PARTY TO IN

2000, PRIMARILY DUE TO ADJUSTMENTS FOR CESSIONS MADE IN 2000. WE DID NOT ENTER

INTO SUCH A TREATY IN 2003 OR 2002. OUR REINSURANCE OPERATION WAS PARTY TO A

SEPARATE AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS TREATY IN 2002 AND 2001. THE RESULTS OF OUR

REINSURANCE OPERATION IN 2002 AND 2001 INCLUDED A $34 MILLION DETRIMENT AND A

$159 MILLION BENEFIT, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THOSE TREATIES. THE DETRIMENT IN

2002 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE COMMUTATION OF A PORTION OF THE 2001 TREATY. WE

DID NOT CEDE ANY LOSSES TO OUR REINSURANCE OPERATIONS 2002 EXCESS-OF-LOSS

TREATY. THE 2001 BENEFIT RESULTED FROM LOSSES CEDED TO THE 2001 TREATY.

CATASTROPHE

LOSSES.

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2003, WE CHANGED OUR DISCLOSURE REGARDING CATASTROPHE LOSSES. WE

NO LONGER CLASSIFY ALL LOSSES FROM INSURANCE SERVICES OFFICE (ISO)-DEFINED

CATASTROPHES AS

62

CATASTROPHE LOSSES. WE

REVISED OUR DEFINITION OF LOSSES REPORTED AS CATASTROPHES TO INCLUDE ONLY

THOSE EVENTS THAT WE BELIEVE GENERATE LOSSES BEYOND A LEVEL NORMALLY EXPECTED

IN OUR BUSINESS. THIS REVISED DEFINITION HAS NO IMPACT ON OUR RECORDED RESULTS

FOR ANY PERIOD INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT. CATASTROPHE LOSSES REPORTED IN PRIOR

PERIODS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM TO OUR NEW DEFINITION. IN 2003, WE DID NOT

EXPERIENCE ANY SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE LOSSES, AS NEWLY DEFINED; HOWEVER, WE

RECORDED A NET $55 MILLION REDUCTION IN THE PROVISION FOR CATASTROPHES INCURRED

IN PRIOR YEARS, NEARLY ALL OF WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

TERRORIST ATTACK.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2002

TOTALED $31 MILLION, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM SEVERAL STORMS ACROSS THE UNITED

STATES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CATASTROPHE LOSSES TOTALED $1.27 BILLION IN 2001,

OF WHICH $941 MILLION WAS DUE TO THE SEPTEMBER 11

TH

TERRORIST

ATTACK. THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAINING CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2001 LARGELY

RESULTED FROM OF A VARIETY OF STORMS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES

AND THE EXPLOSION OF A CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING PLANT IN TOULOUSE, FRANCE. SINCE

CATASTROPHE LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL AN EVENT OCCURS, THE OCCURRENCE OF

A CATASTROPHIC EVENT CAN HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DURING THE PERIOD INCURRED. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO OUR ESTIMATE OF CATASTROPHIC

LOSSES, BASED ON BETTER INFORMATION, CAN ALSO MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS DURING THAT PERIOD.

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

THE BUSINESS CENTERS COMPRISING THIS SEGMENT ARE

DESIGNATED SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS BECAUSE EACH PROVIDES DEDICATED

UNDERWRITING, CLAIM AND RISK CONTROL SERVICES THAT REQUIRE SPECIALIZED

EXPERTISE, AND EACH FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON THE RESPECTIVE CUSTOMERS IT SERVES. INSURANCE

COVERAGE IS OFTEN PROVIDED ON PROPRIETARY INSURANCE FORMS. THIS SEGMENT

INCLUDES OUR

CONSTRUCTION

OPERATIONS, OUR ONGOING

INTERNATIONAL & LLOYDS

OPERATIONS AND EIGHT OTHER SPECIALTY BUSINESS CENTERS COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO

AS SPECIALTY.

WE CONSIDER OUR

SURETY

AND

CONSTRUCTION

BUSINESS CENTERS TO BE SPECIALTY OPERATIONS, BECAUSE EACH BUSINESS REQUIRES

SPECIALIZED UNDERWRITING, RISK MANAGEMENT AND CLAIM EXPERTISE. OUR

SURETY

BUSINESS CENTER UNDERWRITES SURETY

BONDS, WHICH ARE AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH ONE PARTY (THE SURETY) GUARANTEES TO

ANOTHER PARTY (THE OWNER OR OBLIGEE) THAT A THIRD PARTY (THE CONTRACTOR OR

PRINCIPAL) WILL PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. FOR

CONTRACT SURETY

, WE PROVIDE BID, PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT

BONDS, TO A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CLIENTS SPECIALIZING IN GENERAL CONTRACTING,

HIGHWAY AND BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION, ASPHALT PAVING, UNDERGROUND AND PIPELINE

CONSTRUCTION, MANUFACTURING, CIVIL AND HEAVY ENGINEERING, AND MECHANICAL AND

ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION. BID BONDS PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE THAT THE BID HAS

BEEN SUBMITTED IN GOOD FAITH AND THAT THE CONTRACTOR INTENDS TO ENTER INTO THE

CONTRACT AT THE PRICE BID AND PROVIDE THE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT

BONDS. PERFORMANCE BONDS REQUIRE US TO FULFILL THE CONTRACTORS OBLIGATIONS TO

THE OBLIGEE SHOULD THE CONTRACTOR FAIL TO PERFORM UNDER THE CONTRACT. PAYMENT

BONDS GUARANTEE THAT THE CONTRACTOR WILL PAY CERTAIN SUBCONTRACTOR, LABOR AND

MATERIAL BILLS ASSOCIATED WITH A PROJECT. FOR

COMMERCIAL

SURETY

, WE CURRENTLY OFFER LICENSE AND PERMIT BONDS, RECLAMATION

BONDS, FIDUCIARY BONDS, COURT BONDS, PUBLIC OFFICIAL BONDS, INDEMNITY BONDS,

WORKERS COMPENSATION SELF-INSURER BONDS, TRANSFER AGENT INDEMNITY BONDS,

OPERATIONS, OUR SURETY BUSINESS CENTER INCLUDES OUR MEXICAN SUBSIDIARY,

AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES, THE LARGEST SURETY BOND UNDERWRITER IN MEXICO, AND OUR

CANADIAN OPERATION ST. PAUL GUARANTEE, THE LARGEST SURETY BOND UNDERWRITER IN

CANADA. IN TOTAL, BASED ON 2002 PREMIUM VOLUME, OUR SURETY OPERATIONS ARE THE

LARGEST IN NORTH AMERICA. THE

CONSTRUCTION

BUSINESS CENTER OFFERS A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING

TRADITIONAL INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, TO A BROAD RANGE OF

CONTRACTORS AND PARTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.

OUR

INTERNATIONAL &

LLOYDS

OPERATION CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS: OUR ONGOING

OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, AND OUR ONGOING SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE

OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS CENTER

(COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO HEREAFTER AS INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTIES). THROUGH A

SINGLE SYNDICATE AT LLOYDS (FOR WHICH WE PROVIDE 100% OF THE CAPITAL), WE

UNDERWRITE INSURANCE IN FOUR

63

PRINCIPAL LINES OF

BUSINESS: AVIATION, MARINE, GLOBAL PROPERTY AND PERSONAL LINES. AVIATION

UNDERWRITES A BROAD SPECTRUM OF INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE, MANUFACTURER, AIRPORT

AND GENERAL AVIATION BUSINESS. MARINE UNDERWRITES ENERGY, CARGO AND HULL

COVERAGES. GLOBAL PROPERTY UNDERWRITES PROPERTY COVERAGES WORLDWIDE. PERSONAL

LINES PROVIDES SPECIALIZED ACCIDENT AND HEALTH COVERAGES FOR INTERNATIONAL

CLIENTS, INCLUDING PERSONAL ACCIDENT, KIDNAP AND RANSOM, AND PAYMENT PROTECTION

INSURANCE. OUR ONGOING INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTIES (OTHER THAN GLOBAL ACCOUNTS)

ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, WHERE WE

OFFER SPECIALIZED INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO A VARIETY OF

INDUSTRY SECTORS. OUR GLOBAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS CENTER IS BASED IN THE UNITED

STATES.

2003 VS. 2002ALL BUSINESS CENTERS IN THIS CATEGORY

FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

PREMIUM VOLUME OF $624

MILLION IN 2003 WAS 56% HIGHER THAN COMPARABLE 2002 PREMIUMS OF $400 MILLION,

DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES AND NEW BUSINESS PRINCIPALLY GENERATED BY OUR DECEMBER 2002

ACQUISITION OF THE RIGHT TO SEEK TO RENEW THE PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISK

PRACTICE BUSINESS OF ROYAL AND SUNALLIANCE, AND THE MAY 2003 ACQUISITION

OF THE RIGHT TO SEEK TO RENEW ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY

BUSINESS FROM KEMPER INSURANCE COMPANIES.

TECHNOLOGYS

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $426 MILLION IN 2003 GREW 15% OVER 2002 PREMIUM VOLUME

OF $372 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE INCREASES AND NEW BUSINESS.

PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK

PREMIUM VOLUME

OF $131 MILLION IN 2003 WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE 2002 TOTAL OF $61 MILLION, DUE

TO A CHANGE IN OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM RELATED TO THIS OPERATION THAT RESULTED

IN LESS BUSINESS BEING CEDED TO REINSURERS. PRICE INCREASES AVERAGED 20% ACROSS

THE SPECIALTY CATEGORY IN 2003 (EXCLUDING

DISCOVER

RE

AND

PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK

,

WHOSE PREMIUM STRUCTURES DIFFER SOMEWHAT FROM THE REMAINING BUSINESS CENTERS IN

THIS CATEGORY), COMPARED WITH 29% IN 2002.

VIRTUALLY ALL BUSINESS CENTERS IN THE SPECIALTY

CATEGORY CONTRIBUTED TO THE $182 MILLION INCREASE IN UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY

IN 2003. THE MOST NOTABLE IMPROVEMENTS OVER 2002 WERE ACHIEVED BY THE

TECHNOLOGY

BUSINESS CENTER, WITH A $99

MILLION INCREASE IN UNDERWRITING PROFIT, AND

FINANCIAL &

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

, WITH A $39 MILLION INCREASE IN UNDERWRITING

PROFIT. THE

TECHNOLOGY

RESULT IN

2003 INCLUDED $74 MILLION OF FAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR LOSS DEVELOPMENT. IMPROVED

UNDERWRITING DISCIPLINE WITH RESPECT TO RISK SELECTION, SIGNIFICANT PRICE

INCREASES IN RECENT YEARS AND THE ADDITION OF PROFITABLE NEW BUSINESS THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED PROFITABILITY IN THE

SPECIALTY

CATEGORY.

2002 VS. 2001THE 22% INCREASE IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUM

VOLUME IN 2002 OVER 2001 WAS DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES AND NEW BUSINESS IN

SEVERAL BUSINESS CENTERS. VIRTUALLY EVERY BUSINESS CENTER IN THIS SEGMENT

ACHIEVED AN INCREASE IN PREMIUM VOLUME OVER 2001. IN

FINANCIAL & PROFESSIONAL SERVICES,

PREMIUM VOLUME

OF $400 MILLION GREW 21% OVER 2001 DUE TO STRONG PRICE INCREASES, PARTICULARLY

IN THE DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LINE OF BUSINESS.

UMBRELLA/EXCESS & SURPLUS LINES

 WRITTEN PREMIUMS

OF $253 MILLION WERE MORE THAN DOUBLE COMPARABLE 2001 VOLUME OF $116 MILLION,

DRIVEN BY A NEW COMMERCIAL UMBRELLA OPERATION LAUNCHED IN 2002.

TECHNOLOGY

PREMIUMS OF $372 MILLION IN

2002 WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE 2001 TOTAL OF $366 MILLION, REFLECTING THE

EFFECTS OF THE ECONOMIC WEAKNESS IN THE TECHNOLOGY MARKET SECTOR.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR

UNDERWRITING AND PRICING ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THIS CATEGORY WERE REFLECTED IN THE

$188 MILLION IMPROVEMENT IN PROFITABILITY OVER 2001. UNDERWRITING PROFITS IN

FINANCIAL & PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

IN 2002 WERE $74 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2001.

PERSONAL

CATASTROPHE RISK

ACHIEVED A $37 MILLION INCREASE IN PROFITABILITY

OVER 2001. ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE SPECIALTY CATEGORY BENEFITED IN 2002

FROM STRONG PRICE INCREASES AND THE RELATIVE LACK OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES. UNDERWRITING

RESULTS IN 2001 INCLUDED $51 MILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11,

2001 TERRORIST ATTACK.

INTERNATIONAL &

LLOYD S

2003 VS.

2002NET

WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME OF $1.33 BILLION IN 2003 INCLUDED $64 MILLION OF

INCREMENTAL PREMIUMS FROM THE ELIMINATION OF THE ONE-QUARTER REPORTING LAG AT

OUR OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS (THE REMAINING $3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL PREMIUMS

DESCRIBED EARLIER IN THIS DISCUSSION WERE RECORDED IN OUR RUNOFF OTHER SEGMENT).

EXCLUDING THAT ADDITIONAL $64 MILLION, PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2003 OF $1.27 BILLION

WAS STILL 44% HIGHER THAN IN 2002. WE EXPERIENCED STRONG GROWTH IN OUR

OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS DUE TO PRICE INCREASES, NEW BUSINESS, FAVORABLE FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE IMPACTS AND OUR INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN LLOYDS FOLLOWING

THE CONSOLIDATION OF MOST OF OUR LLOYDS OPERATIONS INTO ONE WHOLLY-OWNED

SYNDICATE IN 2003. OUR TOTAL LLOYDS PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2003 WAS $705 MILLION

(INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF THE ONE QUARTER REPORTING LAG),

COMPARED WITH $398 MILLION IN 2002. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY OPERATIONS,

PREMIUM VOLUME OF $627 MILLION WAS 30% HIGHER THAN COMPARABLE 2002 PREMIUMS OF

$483

66

MILLION. PRICE INCREASES,

NEW BUSINESS AND STRONG RENEWAL RETENTION RATES ALL CONTRIBUTED TO THE STRONG

GROWTH OVER 2002. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG IN CANADA.

THE IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERWRITING RESULTS IN 2003 WAS

CONCENTRATED IN OUR INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN CANADA

AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE UNDERWRITING PROFIT AT OUR OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS

WAS DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO $24 MILLION OF PRIOR YEAR LOSSES

IN THE PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS UNIT AT LLOYDS.

2002 VS.

2001



AT LLOYDS, 2002 PREMIUM VOLUME OF $398

MILLION GREW 24% OVER COMPARABLE 2001 PREMIUMS OF $320 MILLION, PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY STRONG PRICE INCREASES AND NEW BUSINESS IN CERTAIN CLASSES OF OUR

PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, AVIATION PREMIUMS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY

DUE TO OUR INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN THAT COVERAGE IN 2002. IN OUR

INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY OPERATIONS, PREMIUM VOLUME OF $483 MILLION WAS 22%

HIGHER THAN THE 2001 TOTAL OF $397 MILLION, DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES AND NEW

BUSINESS THROUGHOUT THESE OPERATIONS. THE 2001 TOTAL INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $44

MILLION OF INCREMENTAL PREMIUMS FROM THE ELIMINATION OF THE ONE-QUARTER

REPORTING LAG.

OUR INTERNATIONAL

SPECIALTY OPERATIONS AND OUR OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS BOTH CONTRIBUTED TO THE $291

MILLION IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERWRITING RESULTS IN 2002 COMPARED WITH 2001. PRICE

INCREASES AND THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES WERE FACTORS IN

THE IMPROVEMENT OVER 2001. UNDERWRITING RESULTS IN 2001 INCLUDED $90 MILLION OF

LOSSES RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACK.

SURETY AND

CONSTRUCTION

2003 VS. 2002NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS GENERATED BY OUR

SURETY

BUSINESS CENTER TOTALED $475

MILLION IN 2003, DOWN 1% COMPARED WITH PREMIUMS OF $480 MILLION IN 2002. THE

DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CLOSING OF CERTAIN FIELD OFFICES, THE IMPACT

OF UNDERWRITING ACTIONS TO IMPROVE THE RISK PROFILE OF OUR BOOK OF BUSINESS,

AND INCREASED REINSURANCE COSTS. IN OUR

CONSTRUCTION

OPERATION, NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2003 OF $759 MILLION WAS 3% LESS THAN

PREMIUMS OF $786 MILLION IN 2002, AS THE IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES IN 2003 WAS

OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN NEW BUSINESS.

THE

SURETY

UNDERWRITING

LOSS TOTALED $168 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH AN UNDERWRITING LOSS OF $111

MILLION IN 2002.

SURETYS

2003

UNDERWRITING LOSS INCLUDED AN $59 MILLION PRETAX LOSS PROVISION (NET OF

REINSURANCE) RELATED TO ONE OF OUR ACCOUNTS THAT WAS IN BANKRUPTCY AND UNABLE

TO PERFORM ITS BONDED OBLIGATIONS. IN APRIL 2003, A BANKRUPTCY COURT

APPROVED THE SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE ACCOUNT. FOLLOWING

THAT APPROVAL, WE RECEIVED CLAIM NOTICES WITH RESPECT TO APPROXIMATELY $120

MILLION OF BONDS SECURING CERTAIN WORKERS COMPENSATION AND RETIREE HEALTH

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF THE ACCOUNT. WE ORIGINALLY RECORDED A NET PRETAX LOSS

PROVISION OF $89 MILLION WHEN THE CLAIM NOTICES WERE RECEIVED AND DETERMINED TO

BE VALID. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE RE-ESTIMATED THE AMOUNT OF

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE RELATED TO THAT PRETAX LOSS, AND RECORDED A $27 MILLION

REDUCTION IN OUR NET LOSS. CONVERSELY, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE

RECORDED A $27 MILLION PROVISION TO STRENGTHEN OUR

SURETY

OPERATIONS PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO A RE-ESTIMATION OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE RELATED TO LOSSES

INCURRED IN 2002 ASSOCIATED WITH ENRON CORPORATIONS BANKRUPTCY. THE 2002

SURETY

UNDERWRITING LOSS INCLUDED A $34

MILLION LOSS PROVISION RECORDED AFTER A JUDICIAL DECISION REGARDING SURETY

BONDS ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO LARGE BRAZILIAN OIL

RIGS.

THE

CONSTRUCTION

UNDERWRITING PROFIT OF $7 MILLION IN 2003 REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT

OVER THE 2002 UNDERWRITING LOSS OF $110 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT

CHARGES TO STRENGTHEN PRIOR-YEAR RESERVES, AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. THE

IMPROVEMENT OVER 2002 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASES AND

OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR BOOK OF BUSINESS THROUGH THE

NONRENEWAL OF UNDERPERFORMING ACCOUNTS AND THE SELECTIVE ADDITION OF NEW

BUSINESS.

67

IN OUR

SURETY

OPERATION, WE CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF REPORTED

LOSSES IN 2003. CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF OUR SURETY BUSINESS TEND TO BE

CHARACTERIZED BY LOW FREQUENCY BUT POTENTIALLY HIGH SEVERITY LOSSES.

WITHIN OUR COMMERCIAL SURETY SEGMENTS, WE HAVE

EXPOSURES RELATED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS, WHICH ARE NOW IN VARIOUS

STAGES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OTHER ACCOUNTS HAVE

EXPERIENCED DETERIORATION IN CREDITWORTHINESS SINCE WE ISSUED BONDS TO THEM. GIVEN

THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND ITS IMPACT ON THESE COMPANIES, WE MAY

EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN CLAIMS AND, POSSIBLY, INCUR HIGH SEVERITY LOSSES. SUCH

LOSSES WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CLAIMS ARE FILED AND

DETERMINED TO BE A VALID LOSS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE SURETY BOND ISSUED.

WITH REGARD TO COMMERCIAL SURETY BONDS ISSUED ON

BEHALF OF COMPANIES OPERATING IN THE ENERGY TRADING SECTOR, OUR AGGREGATE

PRETAX EXPOSURE, NET OF FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE, IS WITH FIVE COMPANIES FOR A

TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $367 MILLION ($305 MILLION OF WHICH IS FROM GAS SUPPLY

BONDS), AN AMOUNT THAT WILL DECLINE OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS. THE LARGEST

INDIVIDUAL EXPOSURE APPROXIMATES $181 MILLION (PRETAX). THESE COMPANIES ALL

CONTINUE TO PERFORM THEIR BONDED OBLIGATIONS AND, THEREFORE, NO CLAIMS HAVE

BEEN FILED.

IN ADDITION TO OUR LARGEST EXPOSURE DISCUSSED ABOVE

WITH RESPECT TO ENERGY TRADING COMPANIES, OUR COMMERCIAL SURETY BUSINESS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003 INCLUDED SEVEN ACCOUNTS WITH GROSS PRETAX BOND EXPOSURES GREATER THAN $100

MILLION EACH, BEFORE REINSURANCE. THE MAJORITY OF THESE ACCOUNTS HAVE

INVESTMENT GRADE RATINGS, AND ALL ACCOUNTS CONTINUE TO PERFORM THEIR BONDED

OBLIGATIONS.

IN 2003, WE SECURED EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE

COVERAGE FOR OUR COMMERCIAL SURETY EXPOSURES IN THE FORM OF TWO NEW TREATIES

PROVIDING $500 MILLION OF AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD, WITH A

MAXIMUM RECOVERY OF $100 MILLION PER PRINCIPAL FOR GAS SUPPLY BONDS AND $150

MILLION PER PRINCIPAL FOR OTHER BONDS. THE REINSURANCE PROGRAM DOES NOT EXTEND

COVERAGE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL SURETY ACCOUNTS WHICH WERE IN

BANKRUPTCY AT THE INCEPTION OF THE REINSURANCE TREATIES.

WE CONTINUE WITH OUR INTENTION TO EXIT THE SEGMENTS OF

THE COMMERCIAL SURETY MARKET DISCUSSED ABOVE BY CEASING TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS

AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, TERMINATING THE OUTSTANDING BONDS. SINCE OCTOBER 2000,

WHEN WE MADE A STRATEGIC DECISION TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE EXPOSURES IN

THESE SEGMENTS, OUR TOTAL COMMERCIAL SURETY GROSS OPEN BOND EXPOSURE HAS

DECREASED BY OVER 56% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A

MARKET FOR TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL SURETY BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES LOW-LIMIT

BUSINESS SUCH AS LICENSE AND PERMIT, PROBATE, PUBLIC OFFICIAL, AND CUSTOMS

BONDS.

IN THE CONTRACT SURETY BUSINESS, CREDITWORTHINESS IS A

PRIMARY UNDERWRITING CONSIDERATION AND THE UNDERWRITING PROCESS INVOLVES A

NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF A CONTRACTORS FINANCIAL

CONDITION, BUSINESS PROSPECTS, EXPERIENCE AND MANAGEMENT. THE RISK IN RESPECT

OF A CONTRACT SURETY BOND CHANGES OVER TIME. SUCH RISK TENDS TO DECREASE AS THE

RELATED CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IS COMPLETED, BUT MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE CONTRACTOR DETERIORATES OR DIFFICULTIES ARISE DURING

THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT. LOSSES IN THE CONTRACT SURETY BUSINESS CAN OCCUR AS

A RESULT OF A CONTRACTORS FAILURE TO COMPLETE ITS BONDED OBLIGATIONS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACT TERMS. SUCH LOSSES, IF ANY, WOULD BE ESTIMATED BY ESTIMATING

THE COST TO COMPLETE THE REMAINING WORK (WHICH MAY INCLUDE AMOUNTS ADVANCED TO

THE CONTRACTOR BY THE SURETY) AND THE CONTRACTORS UNPAID BILLS, OFFSET BY

MONIES DUE TO THE CONTRACTOR, REINSURANCE AND THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE

VALUE OF COLLATERAL. WHILE OUR CONTRACT SURETY BUSINESS TYPICALLY HAS NOT BEEN

CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH SEVERITY LOSSES, IT IS POSSIBLE, GIVEN THE CURRENT

ECONOMIC CLIMATE, THAT SIGNIFICANT LOSSES COULD OCCUR.

SOME OF OUR CONTRACT SURETY BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY

WITH RESPECT TO LARGER ACCOUNTS, IS WRITTEN ON A CO-SURETY BASIS WITH OTHER

SURETY UNDERWRITERS IN ORDER TO MANAGE AND LIMIT OUR AGGREGATE EXPOSURE. CERTAIN

OF THESE SURETIES HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE,

DETERIORATION IN THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS. IF A

LOSS IS INCURRED AND ONE OF OUR CO-SURETIES FAILS TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS

68

UNDER A BOND, WE AND ANY

OTHER CO-SURETY OR CO-SURETIES ON THE BOND TYPICALLY ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY

LIABLE FOR SUCH OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT, OUR LOSSES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASE TO THE EXTENT SUCH AN EVENT OR EVENTS OCCUR.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, WE MADE COLLATERALIZED

ADVANCES TO A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR THAT HAD FAILED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER

CERTAIN OF ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THESE THIRD QUARTER ADVANCES DID NOT IMPACT

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BECAUSE THE LOSS INCURRED WAS OFFSET BY OUR ESTIMATED

RECOVERABLE.

IN RECENT MONTHS, THE CONTRACTOR HAS COMPLETED A

RESTRUCTURING OF ITS FINANCES AND ENTERED INTO REVISED CREDIT AGREEMENTS WITH ITS

LENDERS. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MITIGATE OUR ULTIMATE EXPOSURE TO THIS

ACCOUNT BY FACILITATING THE CONTRACTORS EFFORTS TO COMPLETE BONDED PROJECTS,

WE MADE ADDITIONAL ADVANCES FOR WHICH WE RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX LOSS, NET OF

ESTIMATED REINSURANCE AND CO-SURETY PARTICIPATION, OF APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003. IN FEBRUARY AND EARLY MARCH 2004, WE MADE OR

COMMITTED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL ADVANCES FOR WHICH WE RECORDED A NET AFTER-TAX

LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION. WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR ESTIMATE OF THE

RECOVERABLE FROM THAT ESTABLISHED AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003. ANY

FUTURE CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATE OF THE RECOVERABLE, WHETHER POSITIVE OR

NEGATIVE, WILL AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE MAY MAKE FURTHER ADVANCES

AND, SUBJECT TO OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, WE MAY ALSO DECIDE TO ISSUE BONDS

FOR NEW PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN BY THIS CONTRACTOR.

IF THE CONTRACTOR WERE TO FAIL TO COMPLETE ITS BONDED

PROJECTS, WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR AGGREGATE ADDITIONAL LOSS, NET OF ESTIMATED

COLLATERAL, REINSURANCE RECOVERIES AND PARTICIPATION BY CO-SURETIES (ONE OF

WHICH HAS EXPERIENCED RATINGS DOWNGRADES AND IS IN RUNOFF), WOULD LIKELY NOT

EXCEED $75 MILLION ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS, ASSUMING A 35% STATUTORY TAX RATE. GIVEN

THE UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE CONTRACTORS BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS,

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ESTIMATE AND OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE WILL NOT

INCREASE.

2002 VS. 2001



TOTAL

COMBINED PREMIUM VOLUME FOR OUR

SURETY

AND

CONSTRUCTION

OPERATIONS

INCREASED BY $293 MILLION OVER 2001, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY $220 MILLION OF

PREMIUM GROWTH IN

CONSTRUCTION

,

WHERE PRICE INCREASES AVERAGED 30% IN 2002. IN THE

SURETY

BUSINESS CENTER, PREMIUM VOLUME WAS $73 MILLION

HIGHER THAN IN 2001, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMBINED $100 MILLION CONTRIBUTED BY

ST. PAUL GUARANTEE IN CANADA (FORMERLY LONDON GUARANTEE), ACQUIRED IN MARCH 2002,

AND OUR ACQUISITION IN LATE 2001 OF THE RIGHT TO SEEK TO RENEW SURETY BUSINESS

PREVIOUSLY UNDERWRITTEN BY FIREMANS FUND INSURANCE COMPANY (SEE THE

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES SECTION OF THIS DISCUSSION FOR FURTHER DETAILS

ABOUT THESE ACQUISITIONS). EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE TWO ACQUISITIONS, SURETYS

NET PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2002 WAS SLIGHTLY BELOW COMPARABLE 2001 LEVELS,

REFLECTING THE TIGHTENED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS INSTITUTED IN RECENT YEARS,

PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMERCIAL SURETY BUSINESS, AND AN INCREASE IN

DOMESTIC REINSURANCE COSTS IN 2002.

69

BOTH

BUSINESS CENTERS CONTRIBUTED TO THE $182 MILLION DETERIORATION IN UNDERWRITING

RESULTS COMPARED WITH 2001. THE CONSTRUCTION UNDERWRITING LOSS OF $110 MILLION

WAS $75 MILLION WORSE THAN THE COMPARABLE 2001 LOSS OF $35 MILLION, DRIVEN BY

ADVERSE PRIOR-YEAR LOSS DEVELOPMENT THAT PROMPTED A $113 MILLION FOURTH-QUARTER

PROVISION TO STRENGTHEN LOSS RESERVES IN OUR GENERAL LIABILITY AND WORKERS

COMPENSATION COVERAGES. THE 2002 CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR LOSS RATIO FOR

CONSTRUCTION, HOWEVER, WAS MUCH IMPROVED OVER THE SAME 2001 RATIO, REFLECTING

THE IMPACT OF STRONG UNDERWRITING INITIATIVES, PRICE INCREASES AND THE SHIFT TO

A LARGER-SIZED ACCOUNT PROFILE. APPROXIMATELY

$93 MILLION OF CONSTRUCTIONS $113 MILLION ADVERSE PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT WAS

CONCENTRATED IN GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES. THE TABLE BELOW ALLOCATES

THE GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PORTION OF OUR RESERVE CHARGE IN 2002, BY

ACCIDENT YEAR, WITHIN OUR CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS CENTER.

OUR ANALYSIS OF TRENDS FOR OUR

GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES IN 2002 REVEALED CASE RESERVE STRENGTHENING

OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, ACTUAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT DURING THE

YEAR CONTINUED TO EXCEED OUR EXPECTATIONS. THE AVERAGE PAID CLOSED CLAIM TREND

HAD EXCEEDED THE AVERAGE CASE RESERVE TREND IN THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT. THE

AVERAGE OUTSTANDING CASE RESERVE INCREASED FROM $54,000 AT YEAR-END 2001 TO

$66,000 AT YEAR-END 2002. THE AVERAGE PAID CLAIM INCREASED FROM $18,000 AT

YEAR-END 2001 TO $28,000 AT YEAR-END 2002. WHILE THE AVERAGE PAID CLAIM WAS

STILL BELOW THE AVERAGE CASE RESERVE, THIS DEVELOPMENT IN THE DATA CAUSED US TO

REVISE OUR TRENDS AND INCREASE OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE LOSSES. WE INCREASED

OUR ESTIMATE OF REQUIRED LOSS RESERVES AND RECORDED A $93 MILLION INCREASE TO

LOSS RESERVES. HOWEVER, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO ANY OTHER UNDERLYING

ASSUMPTIONS.

THE REMAINING RESERVE CHARGE OF

$20 MILLION RELATED TO WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGES (WITH BEGINNING 2002

RESERVES OF $363 MILLION), PRIMARILY FROM THE 2001 ACCIDENT YEAR. THIS CHARGE

RESULTED FROM A COMPREHENSIVE CLAIM REVIEW WHICH FOCUSED ON, AMONG OTHER DATA,

A BETTER ESTIMATE OF OUR LIFE-TIME BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT OF THIS

REVIEW, WE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS IDENTIFIED AS RECEIVING LIFE-TIME

BENEFITS AND, ACCORDINGLY, INCREASED THE RELATED LOSS RESERVES. NO CHANGES WERE

MADE TO OUR UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS.

SURETYS 2002 UNDERWRITING LOSS WAS $111 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $4 MILLION IN 2001. THE 2002 RESULTS REFLECTED

PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE CHARGES OF $104 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $34 MILLION RELATED

TO THE JUDGMENT REGARDING THE PETROBRAS OIL RIG CONSTRUCTION RELATED TO A 1996

INCIDENT, AND $7 MILLION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION RELATED TO SURETY

CONTRACTS ISSUED ON BEHALF OF ENRON CORPORATION RELATED TO A 2001 REPORTED

INCIDENT. SURETYS UNDERWRITING RESULTS IN 2002 WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

BY REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS PAID FOR CONTRACT SURETY REINSURANCE, WHICH REDUCED

OUR NET EARNED PREMIUMS, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN LOSSES IN OUR CONTRACT

SURETY BUSINESS WHERE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A HIGHER THAN NORMAL LEVEL OF LOSS

FREQUENCY.

IN

ADDITION TO THE PETROBRAS AND ENRON EVENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE, WE EXPERIENCED AN

INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES IN 2002, WITH MUCH OF THIS INCREASE BEING

TIED TO THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN NORTH AMERICA. INCLUDED IN THE $104 MILLION OF

PRIOR-YEAR DEVELOPMENT FOR 2002 WAS A FOURTH-QUARTER PROVISION TOTALING $63

MILLION IN OUR DOMESTIC SURETY OPERATIONS AS DETAILED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. THE

ENTIRE SURETY BUSINESS CENTER PRIOR YEAR RESERVE CHARGE WAS DRIVEN BY

DEVELOPMENT ON SPECIFIC CLAIMS. SINCE SURETY LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL

THE PERIOD A CLAIM IS FILED, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO ASSUMPTIONS. THE INSURANCE

70

CONCEPT OF ACCIDENT YEAR IS NOT MEANINGFUL TO SURETY

BUSINESS. THE YEARLY INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS THE YEAR IN

THE 26% INCREASE IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUM

RETENTION, CONTINUED PRICE INCREASES, AND SIGNIFICANT NEW BUSINESS GENERATED BY

OUR ACQUISITION OF THE RIGHT TO RENEW CERTAIN BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY UNDERWRITTEN

BY KEMPER INSURANCE COMPANIES (DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL EARLIER IN THIS

DISCUSSION). AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF SIGNIFICANT

71

PRICE INCREASES AND

SELECTIVE RE-UNDERWRITING OF OUR BOOK OF BUSINESS IN THIS SEGMENT, OUR FOCUS IN

2003 WAS ON RETAINING THE QUALITY NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS. ALTHOUGH

THE PACE OF PRICE INCREASES BEGAN TO SLOW IN 2003, CONTINUED FAVORABLE MARKET

CONDITIONS AND OUR STRONG PRESENCE IN THE MARKETPLACE PROVIDED US WITH THE

OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE FURTHER PRICE INCREASES, WHERE APPROPRIATE. PRICE

INCREASES ACROSS THE ENTIRE SEGMENT AVERAGED 11% FOR THE YEAR. THROUGHOUT THE

COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT IN 2003, WE CONTINUED TO NONRENEW UNDERPERFORMING

CLASSES OF BUSINESS AND UTILIZE OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK TO CAPITALIZE ON NEW

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. THE KEMPER RENEWAL RIGHTS TRANSACTION PROVIDED AN

INFLUX OF QUALITY EXPOSURES THAT AUGMENTED THE SOLID BASE OF BUSINESS WE HAVE

BUILT IN RECENT YEARS.

IN OUR

MIDDLE MARKET COMMERCIAL

BUSINESS CENTER, NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME OF $1.61 BILLION WAS 31% HIGHER

THAN COMPARABLE 2002 PREMIUMS OF $1.23 BILLION. IN THE

SMALL

COMMERCIAL

BUSINESS CENTER, WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $741 MILLION GREW

19% OVER 2002 PREMIUMS OF $622 MILLION. AFTER EXTENSIVE EFFORTS IN 2002 TO

BUILD OUR CAPABILITY TO SERVE THE SMALL COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE, WE TURNED OUR

FOCUS IN 2003 TO LAUNCHING OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS TAILORED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

THIS MARKET SECTOR. IN THE

PROPERTY

SOLUTIONS

BUSINESS CENTER, 2003 PREMIUM VOLUME OF $73 MILLION WAS

31% HIGHER THAN 2002 PREMIUMS OF $56 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW BUSINESS

VOLUME AND A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF BUSINESS CEDED TO REINSURERS.

THE COMMERCIAL LINES UNDERWRITING PROFIT OF $235

MILLION IN 2003 WAS OVER 65% HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2002 PROFIT OF $141

MILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STRONG IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR

RESULTS IN EACH BUSINESS CENTER COMPRISING THE SEGMENT. THE GROWTH IN

PROFITABILITY IN 2003 WAS ACHIEVED DESPITE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES IN 2003 COMPARED WITH 2002, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM

STORMS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES DURING THE YEAR. RESULTS IN 2003 ALSO

BENEFITED FROM $30 MILLION OF FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT ON PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES.

THE 2003 UNDERWRITING PROFIT REFLECTS THE SUCCESS OF OUR STRINGENT UNDERWRITING

PRINCIPLES AND AGGRESSIVE RISK CONTROL EFFORTS, AS WELL AS THE SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACHIEVED IN 2002 AND 2003. IN ADDITION, IN 2003 WE

ACCELERATED OUR FOCUS ON EXPENSE DISCIPLINE, WHICH RESULTED IN AN OVER

ONE-POINT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR STATUTORY EXPENSE RATIO FOR THE YEAR. AS WE

CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS, INCLUDING INCREASED USE OF

AUTOMATION AND PROCESSING IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES, WE EXPECT FURTHER

IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR EXPENSE RATIO GOING FORWARD.

2002 VS.

2001



PREMIUM GROWTH OF 15% IN 2002 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE INCREASES, THE IMPACTS OF WHICH WERE OFFSET SOMEWHAT BY

A DECLINE IN BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS RESULTING FROM OUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE

PROFITABILITY. WE CAPITALIZED ON FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS IN 2002 BY

IMPLEMENTING SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASES, REJECTING NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS

WHERE WE COULD NOT ACHIEVE APPROPRIATE PRICE INCREASES, AND SELECTIVELY ADDING

NEW BUSINESS THAT MET OUR PRICING AND UNDERWRITING CRITERIA. PRICE INCREASES

ACROSS THE ENTIRE SEGMENT AVERAGED 23% IN 2002.

MIDDLE MARKET COMMERCIAL

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS TOTALED $1.23

BILLION IN 2002, 9% HIGHER THAN 2001 PREMIUMS OF $1.12 BILLION. OUR FOCUS IN

2002 WAS TO MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR MIDDLE MARKET BOOK OF

BUSINESS; AS A RESULT, THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT RATE INCREASES WAS

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN BUSINESS RETENTION RATES AND NEW BUSINESS

LEVELS.

SMALL COMMERCIAL

PREMIUM

VOLUME OF $622 MILLION IN 2002 GREW 7% OVER 2001 PREMIUMS OF $575 MILLION. WE

GREATLY EXPANDED OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE SMALL COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE IN 2002

THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS TO SERVE PARTICULAR SECTORS OF THE MARKET,

AND THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE EASY ACCESS TO THOSE PRODUCTS BY

AGENTS, BROKERS AND INSUREDS.

THE COMMERCIAL LINES

SEGMENT TOTAL UNDERWRITING PROFIT IN 2002 OF $141 MILLION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPROVED OVER THE 2001 UNDERWRITING LOSS OF $153 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $136

MILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACK. CURRENT

ACCIDENT-YEAR RESULTS IN 2002 IN ALL THREE BUSINESS CENTERS IN THIS SEGMENT

IMPROVED OVER 2001, WITH THE MOST NOTABLE IMPROVEMENT OCCURRING IN

MIDDLE MARKET COMMERCIAL

. THE $158 MILLION

IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERWRITING RESULTS FROM 2001 TO 2002 (AFTER EXCLUDING LOSSES

FROM THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN 2001) REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES AND

THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF OUR BOOK OF BUSINESS, AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN

WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES. IN 2001, REPORTED RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY

WORSE IF NOT FOR THE BENEFIT OF A $128 MILLION REDUCTION IN PRIOR-YEAR LOSS

RESERVES, OF WHICH $93 MILLION RELATED TO CERTAIN BUSINESS WRITTEN PRIOR TO

VOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS, AS WELL AS LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN

PRIOR TO 1980 (PRIOR TO 1988 FOR BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN OUR MERGER WITH USF&G

CORPORATION IN 1998). IN ADDITION TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY INSURANCE

PREMIUMS IN 2003 PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF EXTENDED REPORTING ENDORSEMENTS AND A

SMALL AMOUNT OF PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY COVERAGE FOR OTHER PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS

DENTISTS, NURSE ANESTHETISTS, AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE NOT

PHYSICIANS OR SURGEONS. THESE OTHER PROFESSIONAL POLICIES WERE PART OF

THREE-YEAR POLICIES THAT WE HAD COMMITTED TO PRIOR TO OUR EXIT FROM THE HEALTH

CARE LINES OF BUSINESS IN 2001. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO OFFER

REPORTING ENDORSEMENTS TO CLAIMS-MADE POLICY HOLDERS AT THE TIME THEIR POLICIES

ARE NOT RENEWED. THESE ENDORSEMENTS COVER LOSSES THAT OCCURRED IN PRIOR PERIODS

THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN REPORTED. UNLIKE TYPICAL POLICIES, PREMIUMS ON THESE

ENDORSEMENTS ARE FULLY EARNED, AND THE EXPECTED LOSSES ARE FULLY RESERVED, AT

THE TIME THE ENDORSEMENT IS WRITTEN. THE VAST MAJORITY OF REPORTING

ENDORSEMENTS UNDERWRITTEN IN 2003 PERTAINED TO PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS

LIABILITY COVERAGE.

THE

2003 UNDERWRITING LOSS INCLUDED A $350 MILLION PROVISION RECORDED IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER TO INCREASE NET PRIOR ACCIDENT YEAR LOSS RESERVES. THE MAJORITY OF

REMAINING UNDERWRITING LOSSES IN 2003 CONSISTED OF CURRENT-YEAR LOSS PROVISIONS

THE CHANGE IN ASSUMPTIONS THAT RESULTED IN THE $350 MILLION CHARGE IN 2003

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THE MOST RECENT INCURRED YEARS, AS EXPECTED.

THE FOLLOWING PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF TRENDS WE OBSERVED

WITHIN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION, BY QUARTER, FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2003. THE DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON OUR MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LINE OF BUSINESS, SINCE

99% OF THE RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THIS BUSINESS. OUR MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE BUSINESS INCLUDES ALL MEDICAL LIABILITY COVERAGE WITHIN OUR HEALTH

CARE OPERATION, AND COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 93% OF OUR TOTAL HEALTH CARE

SEGMENT RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003; THE REMAINING BUSINESS INCLUDED IN

THIS OPERATION IS REPRESENTED BY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ANCILLARY BUSINESS (SUCH

AS AUTOMOBILE AND PROPERTY COVERAGE FOR OUR MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CUSTOMERS). THERE

WERE NO OFFSETTING INCREASES OR DECREASES IN RESERVES OF DIFFERENT LINES WITHIN

OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION. OF THE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS

RECORDED IN 2003, APPROXIMATELY 17% RELATED TO 2002 INCURRED LOSSES;

APPROXIMATELY 33% TO 2001 INCURRED LOSSES; APPROXIMATELY 23% TO 2000 INCURRED

LOSSES; APPROXIMATELY 4% TO 1999 INCURRED LOSSES; AND THE REMAINDER OF 23% TO

INCURRED LOSSES IN 1998 AND PRIOR YEARS. OF THE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE RESERVE

ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN 2002, APPROXIMATELY 88% RELATED TO

75

2001 INCURRED LOSSES;

APPROXIMATELY 50% TO 2000 INCURRED LOSSES; APPROXIMATELY (7)% TO 1999 INCURRED

LOSSES; APPROXIMATELY 6% TO 1998 INCURRED LOSSES; AND THE REMAINDER OF (37)% TO

INCURRED LOSSES IN 1997 AND PRIOR YEARS. OF THE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE RESERVE

ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN 2001, APPROXIMATELY 29% RELATED TO 2000 INCURRED LOSSES;

APPROXIMATELY 30% TO 1999 INCURRED LOSSES; APPROXIMATELY 15% TO 1998 INCURRED

LOSSES; APPROXIMATELY 10% TO 1997 INCURRED LOSSES; AND THE REMAINING 16% TO

INCURRED LOSSES IN 1996 AND PRIOR YEARS.

IN GENERAL, THE RESERVE INCREASES DISCUSSED BELOW HAVE

PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM CLAIM PAYMENTS BEING GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED DUE TO

THE RECENT ESCALATION OF LARGE JURY AWARDS, WHICH INCLUDED SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER

THAN EXPECTED PAIN AND SUFFERING AWARDS. THIS AFFECTED OUR VIEW OF NOT ONLY

THOSE CASES GOING TO TRIAL, BUT ALSO OUR VIEW OF ALL CASES WHERE SETTLEMENTS

ARE NEGOTIATED AND THE THREAT OF A LARGE JURY VERDICT AIDS THE PLAINTIFF BAR IN

THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS. THE RECENT ESCALATION IN CLAIM COSTS IN THE PERIODS

NOTED BELOW THAT RESULTED FROM THESE DEVELOPMENTS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN

ORIGINALLY PROJECTED TRENDS (WHICH HAD NOT FORECASTED THE CHANGE IN THE

JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENT), AND HAS NOW BEEN CONSIDERED IN OUR ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS

AND THE PROJECTION OF ULTIMATE LOSS COSTS. IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF THE RESERVE

INCREASE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001 RESULTED FROM INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM

THE WORK OF A HEALTH CARE CLAIMS TASK FORCE, CREATED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF

2001, WHICH FOCUSED RESOLUTION EFFORTS ON OUR LARGEST CLAIMS WITH THE INTENT OF

LOWERING OUR ULTIMATE LOSS COSTS.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES, FOR EACH QUARTER OF 2003, 2002 AND 2001, OUR ENDING

NET RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND ALLOCATED LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR OUR HEALTH

CARE SEGMENT, ANY PRIOR-PERIOD RESERVE STRENGTHENING RECORDED IN THE QUARTER

(ALL RELATED TO THE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE PORTION OF THE SEGMENT), AND THE

THE INSURANCE

LOSS RESERVING PROCESS INVOLVES JUDGMENT BY ACTUARIES AND MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING

EVALUATION NOT ONLY OF UNDERLYING DATA, BUT ALSO OF CHANGES IN LEGAL, ECONOMIC

AND SOCIETAL FACTORS THAT ARE GENERALLY NOT QUANTIFIABLE. SUCH APPLICATION OF

JUDGMENT INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF TRENDS THAT DEVELOP OVER TIME AND WHICH MAKE

IT DIFFICULT TO DIRECTLY CORRELATE SPECIFIC DATA POINTS (AS DISCUSSED

PREVIOUSLY) WITH A SPECIFIC RESERVING DECISION.

76

2001

IN THE FIRST QUARTER, WE DETERMINED THAT TRENDS THAT

HAD BEGUN TO APPEAR IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2000 WITH RESPECT TO

THE BOOK OF BUSINESS OF ACIC WERE OUTSIDE OF EXPECTED TRENDS, RESULTING IN

INCREASES TO OUR EXPECTED AVERAGE CASE RESERVE OUTSTANDING AND AVERAGE PAID

CLAIMS. WITHIN THE FIRE & MARINE BOOK OF BUSINESS, WE ALSO OBSERVED A

CONTINUATION OF THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE OUTSTANDING CASE RESERVE LEVELS AND

IN THE AVERAGE PAID CLAIMS. WE BELIEVE THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THESE INCREASES

WAS THE JUDICIAL TREND NOTED ABOVE. WE REVISED OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE LOSSES

AND MADE A RESERVE ADDITION OF $90 MILLION. IN THE SECOND QUARTER, WE

DETERMINED THAT THE SHARP INCREASES IN AVERAGE PAID CLAIMS AND OUTSTANDING CASE

RESERVE LEVELS DURING THE PRIOR QUARTERS AND THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001

INDICATED A NEED TO INCREASE OUR ACTUARIAL ESTIMATE OF REQUIRED RESERVES

(WITHOUT CHANGING OUR PROJECTED TRENDS) IN LIGHT OF THE ADVERSE JUDICIAL AWARDS

NOTED ABOVE, AND WE MADE A RESERVE ADDITION OF $105 MILLION. IN THE THIRD

QUARTER, WHILE CASE RESERVE LEVELS INCREASED, THE AVERAGE PAID CLAIMS WERE

WITHIN AN EXPECTED LEVEL. CERTAIN OF OUR MODELS INDICATED A NEED FOR INCREASED

RESERVES, WHILE OTHER METHODS, INCLUDING THE RESULTS OF STRESS TESTING THE

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS (PRIMARILY THE LEVEL OF CASE RESERVES AND PAID

ACTIVITY), INDICATED THAT RESERVES WERE APPROPRIATE IN TOTAL FOR OUR HEALTH

CARE SEGMENT. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERED ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND DETERMINED

THAT RESERVES WERE APPROPRIATE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2001.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, WE REVISED CERTAIN

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON THE ADVERSE TRENDS OBSERVED IN THE PRIOR THREE

QUARTERS. AVERAGE CASE RESERVE LEVELS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO OUR

EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY CASES THAT COULD BE EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

AND MANAGE THEM TO CLOSURE MORE ACTIVELY. BASED ON THE EVOLVING TRENDS WE HAD

OBSERVED EMERGING IN PRIOR QUARTERS, AS WELL AS ESCALATING CLAIM PAYMENTS

OBSERVED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, WE CONCLUDED THAT AVERAGE PAYMENTS WERE

NOT ONLY AT A NEW SUSTAINED AND HIGHER LEVEL, BUT THAT THEY COULD ALSO INCREASE

BEYOND THOSE AVERAGE PAYMENTS, AND/OR AT A RATE FASTER THAN INFLATION. WE THUS

CONCLUDED IT WAS APPROPRIATE AT THAT TIME TO CHANGE THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

WE HAD BEEN USING IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PATTERN TO CONSIDER HIGHER LOSS SEVERITIES

AND A FASTER RATE OF GROWTH FOR LOSSES. SPECIFICALLY, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2001, WE ADJUSTED OUR ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE INCURRED

AND PAID LOSSES AT EACH 12-MONTH PERIOD FROM THE REPORTED LOSS DATE. THESE

ASSUMPTIONS INCREASED THE EXPECTED ULTIMATE INCURRED LOSS FROM A 2% INCREASE

OVER OUR ESTIMATED INCURRED AT 108 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE REPORTED DATE, TO A 24%

INCREASE OVER ESTIMATED INCURRED AT 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE REPORTED DATE. SIMILARLY,

WE INCREASED OUR EXPECTED ULTIMATE PAID LOSS ASSUMPTION FROM A 3% INCREASE OVER

OUR PAID LOSSES AT 108 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE REPORTED DATE TO A 46% INCREASE

OVER OUR ASSUMPTION OF THE PAID LOSSES AT 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE REPORTED DATE.

AFTER CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION OF DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS AND THE

RESULTING REVISION OF OUR ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, A CHARGE TO

RESERVES OF $540 MILLION WAS DETERMINED TO BE NECESSARY AND WAS RECORDED DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001.

2002

FOLLOWING THE CUMULATIVE PRIOR-YEAR RESERVE CHARGES OF

$735 MILLION IN 2001, ACTIVITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002 DEVELOPED ACCORDING

TO PROJECTIONS. AVERAGE PAID CLAIMS FOR THE FULL YEAR OF 2001 FOR MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE LINES HAD BEEN $117,000, INCLUDING A FOURTH QUARTER AVERAGE OF

$124,000. THE PHRASE AVERAGE PAID CLAIMS AS USED HEREIN EXCLUDES CLAIMS WHICH

WERE SETTLED OR CLOSED FOR WHICH NO LOSS OR LOSS EXPENSE WAS PAID. IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2002, THE AVERAGE PAID LOSS WAS DOWN TO $111,000. WE INTERPRETED

THIS AS A POSITIVE SIGN THAT PRIOR YEAR RESERVE CHARGES UP TO THIS POINT HAD

BEEN ADEQUATE. THE AVERAGE OUTSTANDING CASE RESERVE INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM

$141,000 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001 TO $144,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2002, BUT THIS WAS INTERPRETED AS A RELATIVELY BENIGN CHANGE, GIVEN INFLATION

AND THE PROMISING DECREASE IN AVERAGE PAYMENT AMOUNTS. NO ADDITIONAL RESERVE

ACTION WAS TAKEN.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, AVERAGE PAID CLAIMS FOR

MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LINES WERE AGAIN SOMEWHAT ABOVE EXPECTATIONS, RISING TO

$130,000 FOR THE QUARTER. THIS, COUPLED WITH AN ADDITIONAL INCREASE IN THE

77

AVERAGE OUTSTANDING CASE

RESERVE TO $148,000, PROMPTED MANAGEMENT TO REFLECT THESE NEW INCREASED AVERAGES

IN ITS RESERVE ANALYSIS AND RECORD A RESERVE INCREASE OF $97 MILLION.

THROUGHOUT 2002, WE INITIATED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO

OUR HEALTH CARE CLAIMS ORGANIZATION AND RESOLUTION PROCESS. DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2002, WE BEGAN TO SEE THE RESULTS OF EXECUTING THIS STRATEGY. SPECIFICALLY,

CASE LOADS PER ADJUSTER HAD BEGUN TO DECLINE SUBSTANTIALLY AND THE PROCESS FOR

PROVIDING OVERSIGHT ON HIGH EXPOSURE CASES HAD BEEN STREAMLINED, ENABLING A

MORE EXPEDITIOUS APPROACH TO OUR HANDLING OF THESE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLAIMSINCLUDING

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STRONGER CASE RESERVES. WE ALSO ADDED STAFF WITH EXPERTISE

IN HIGH EXPOSURE LITIGATION MANAGEMENT TO ASSIST CLAIM HANDLERS IN AGGRESSIVELY

PURSUING APPROPRIATE RESOLUTIONS ON A FILE-BY-FILE BASIS. THIS ALLOWED US TO

ESTABLISH MORE EFFECTIVE RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO EITHER RESOLVE CLAIMS PRIOR

TO GOING TO TRIAL OR, FOR THOSE CLAIMS DEEMED AS NON-MERITORIOUS, MAINTAIN AN

AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE. WE ALSO BECAME MORE SELECTIVE IN DETERMINING WHICH CASES

ARE TAKEN TO TRIAL AND MORE WILLING TO MAKE USE OF OUR RIGHT TO SELECT DEFENSE

COUNSEL IN THOSE INSTANCES THAT WE DECIDE TO LITIGATE. THIS CAUSED OUR RATIO OF

DEFENSE VERDICTS TO PLAINTIFF VERDICTS TO IMPROVE OVER PRIOR YEARS. WE BEGAN TO

MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR CLAIM DISPOSITION STRATEGIES TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF

CATASTROPHIC VERDICTS. WE BELIEVE THAT EXECUTING THIS STRATEGY INCREASED OUR

ABILITY TO REDUCE OUR ULTIMATE INDEMNITY LOSSES.

AS NOTED ABOVE, AS PART OF OUR FOCUS ON CLAIM

RESOLUTION, WE INCREASED OUR EMPHASIS ON ROUTINELY REVIEWING OUR CASE RESERVES

AND PUT IN PLACE A PROCESS WHERE MANAGERS ACTIVELY REVIEW EACH ADJUSTERS

ENTIRE INVENTORY OF PENDING FILES TO ASSURE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT CASE

RESERVES ARE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT SETTLEMENT VALUES. IN ADDITION, AS WE MOVED

FURTHER INTO RUNOFF, OUR MIX OF PAID AND OUTSTANDING CLAIMS CHANGED AND WE

EXPECTED THAT OUR STATISTICAL DATA WOULD REFLECT FEWER NEW CLAIMS. WE EXPECTED

OUR CLAIM COUNTS TO GO DOWN AND THE AVERAGE SIZE OF OUR OUTSTANDING AND PAID

CLAIMS TO GO UP SINCE NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS ARE OFTEN SETTLED AT MINIMAL LOSS

OR LOSS EXPENSE COST.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002, ALTHOUGH OUR AVERAGE

PAID CLAIM DECREASED SLIGHTLY TO $126,000, OUR AVERAGE OUTSTANDING CLAIM

RESERVE INCREASED TO $166,000. WE BELIEVED THAT INCREASES IN THE AVERAGE

OUTSTANDING CLAIM RESERVE WAS DUE TO BOTH THE CLAIM MIX AND CASE STRENGTHENING

AS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND WAS NOT UNEXPECTED IN A RUNOFF ENVIRONMENT. ACCORDINGLY,

WE DID NOT RECORD ANY RESERVE CHARGE GIVEN THE FAVORABLE EFFECTS WE ANTICIPATE

REALIZING IN FUTURE ULTIMATE PAYMENTS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE AVERAGE PAID CLAIM

INCREASED TO $153,000 AND THE AVERAGE OUTSTANDING CASE RESERVE INCREASED TO

$181,000, WHICH WE BELIEVE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED OBSERVATIONS

AND WAS REASONABLE RELATIVE TO OUR EXPECTATIONS. ALSO DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER, WE DETERMINED THAT OUR CLAIM INVENTORY HAD BEEN REDUCED CONSIDERABLY

AND HAD MATURED TO A LEVEL AT WHICH WE APPROPRIATELY BEGAN TO CONSIDER OTHER

MORE RELEVANT DATA AND STATISTICS SUITABLE FOR EVALUATING RESERVES IN A RUNOFF

ENVIRONMENT.

DURING 2002, AND AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE CONCLUDED THAT

THE IMPACT OF SETTLING CLAIMS IN A RUNOFF ENVIRONMENT WAS CAUSING ABNORMAL

EFFECTS ON OUR AVERAGE PAID CLAIMS, AVERAGE OUTSTANDING CLAIMS, AND THE AMOUNT

OF AVERAGE CASE RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR NEW CLAIMSALL OF WHICH ARE

TRADITIONAL STATISTICS USED BY OUR ACTUARIES TO DEVELOP INDICATED RANGES OF

EXPECTED LOSS. TAKING THESE CHANGING STATISTICS INTO ACCOUNT, WE DEVELOPED

VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF OUR DATA WHICH IMPLIED ADDED UNCERTAINTY TO OUR

EVALUATION OF THESE RESERVES. IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT THIS DATA, WHEN

APPROPRIATELY EVALUATED IN LIGHT OF THE IMPACT OF OUR MIGRATION TO A RUNOFF

ENVIRONMENT, SUPPORTS OUR VIEW THAT WE WILL REALIZE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS ON OUR

ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, WE ESTABLISHED SPECIFIC

TOOLS AND METRICS TO MORE EXPLICITLY MONITOR AND VALIDATE OUR KEY ASSUMPTIONS

SUPPORTING OUR RESERVE CONCLUSIONS SINCE WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TRADITIONAL

STATISTICS AND RESERVING METHODS NEEDED TO BE SUPPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

A MORE MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS.

THE

TOOLS WE DEVELOPED TRACK THE THREE PRIMARY INDICATORS WHICH ARE INFLUENCING OUR

EXPECTATIONS

78

AND

INCLUDE: A) NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS, B) RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS AND

C) THE REDUNDANCY RATIO, COMPARING THE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS TO THE

RESERVE ESTABLISHED FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.

EMERGENCE

OF NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS



OUR HEALTH CARE BOOK OF BUSINESS WAS PUT INTO RUNOFF AT THE

END OF 2001 AND OUR OUTSTANDING EXPOSURE RAPIDLY DROPPED, AS EXPECTED. SINCE

THE MAJORITY OF COVERAGE WE OFFERED WAS ON A CLAIMS-MADE BASIS, AND

NOTIFICATION OF THE CLAIM MUST BE MADE WITHIN THE POLICY PERIOD, THE POTENTIAL

FOR UNREPORTED CLAIMS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. WE EXPECTED THAT THE EMERGENCE

OF NEWLY REPORTED MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLAIMS, WITH INCURRED YEARS OF 2002 OR

PRIOR, WOULD NOT EXCEED 40% OF OUR CURRENT OUTSTANDING CASE RESERVE AMOUNT.

DEVELOPMENT

ON KNOWN CLAIMS



AS

PART OF EXECUTING OUR RUNOFF CLAIMS STRATEGY, THE INVENTORY OF CLAIM-SPECIFIC

CASE RESERVES WAS REVIEWED DURING 2002 IN AN EFFORT TO RESERVE EACH CLAIM AS

APPROPRIATELY AS POSSIBLE. THIS EFFORT WAS IN ITS ADVANCED STAGES AT THE END OF

2002, AND OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL RESERVE STRENGTHENING ON KNOWN CLAIMS

WAS CONSIDERED TO BE MINIMAL. WE DID NOT EXPECT ADDITIONAL CASE DEVELOPMENT ON

MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLAIMS TO EXCEED 3% OF EXISTING CASE RESERVES.

CASE REDUNDANCY



WHILE THERE WERE CLAIMS SETTLEMENTS WHICH

EXCEEDED THE CLAIM-SPECIFIC RESERVE THAT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED, ON THE WHOLE,

CLAIMS WERE BEING SETTLED AT A LEVEL SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE INDIVIDUAL

CASE RESERVE PREVIOUSLY CARRIED. DURING 2001, THE AMOUNT OF EXCESS RESERVES

ABOVE SETTLED AMOUNTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES

(REFERRED TO AS A REDUNDANCY RATIO) WERE IN THE RANGE OF 25% TO 30%. BY THE END

OF 2002, THE REDUNDANCY RATIO HAD INCREASED TO BETWEEN 35% AND 40%. WE EXPECTED

THIS RATIO TO STAY WITHIN THIS RANGE TO SUPPORT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF A REASONABLE

PROVISION FOR OUR LOSS RESERVES.

2003

IN 2003, WE EVALUATED THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PREVIOUSLY

ESTABLISHED MEDICAL MALPRACTICE RESERVES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THREE INDICATORS

DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS IN THE FIRST

QUARTER TOTALED $118 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY 25% LESS THAN WE ANTICIPATED IN OUR

ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF REDUNDANCY AT YEAR-END 2002. WITH

REGARD TO DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS, LOSS ACTIVITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2003 WAS WITHIN OUR EXPECTATIONS. CASE DEVELOPMENT ON INCURRED YEARS 2001 AND

PRIOR WAS MINIMAL, AND CASE DEVELOPMENT ON THE 2002 INCURRED YEAR TOTALED $39

MILLION, WITHIN OUR YEAR-END 2002 ESTIMATE OF NO MORE THAN 3% OF DEVELOPMENT. FOR

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, OUR REDUNDANCY RATIO WAS WITHIN OUR EXPECTED RANGE

OF BETWEEN 35% AND 40%.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF

NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS TOTALED $127 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY 5% HIGHER THAN WE

ANTICIPATED IN OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF RESERVES AT

YEAR-END 2002. NEVERTHELESS, THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF 2003, THE DOLLAR AMOUNT

OF NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS WAS APPROXIMATELY 12% LOWER THAN WE ANTICIPATED. LOSS

DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 WAS NEGATIVE, BUT

NOT AS NEGATIVE AS WE ANTICIPATED. OUR ACTUAL REDUNDANCY RATIO CONTINUED TO

IMPROVE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003; HOWEVER, SINCE NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS AND

LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS DID NOT IMPROVE AS MUCH AS WE EXPECTED IN THE

SECOND QUARTER, THE REQUIRED RESERVE REDUNDANCY HAD INCREASED MODESTLY FROM THE

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED RANGE OF 35% TO 40%.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF

NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS TOTALED $108 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY 10% HIGHER THAN WE

ANTICIPATED IN OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF RESERVES AT

YEAR-END 2002. HOWEVER, THROUGH THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003, THE DOLLAR

AMOUNT OF NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS WAS APPROXIMATELY 7% LOWER THAN WE ANTICIPATED

DUE TO THE POSITIVE VARIANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER. LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN

CLAIMS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 WAS WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED. OUR ACTUAL

REDUNDANCY RATIO CONTINUED TO IMPROVE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003; HOWEVER,

SINCE NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS AGAIN DID NOT

IMPROVE AS MUCH AS WE EXPECTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER, THE REQUIRED RESERVE REDUNDANCY

HAD INCREASED FROM THE PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED RANGE OF 35% TO 40% TO

APPROXIMATELY 45%.

79

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF

NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS TOTALED $65 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY 24% BETTER THAN WE

ANTICIPATED IN OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF RESERVES AT

YEAR-END 2002. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2003 WAS APPROXIMATELY 10% BETTER THAN OUR ORIGINAL EXPECTATION. WE CONSIDER

THE ASSUMPTIONS WE MADE AT THE END OF 2002 FOR NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS TO BE

APPROPRIATE AND WE HAVE MADE NO CHANGES TO THOSE ASSUMPTIONS. LOSS DEVELOPMENT

ON KNOWN CLAIMS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY WORSE THAN

ANTICIPATED. HOWEVER, THROUGH ALL OF 2003, THE CUMULATIVE DEVELOPMENT WAS

CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN EXPECTED. THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER, THIS ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS WAS OFFSET BY CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT ON THE ACTUAL

REDUNDANCY RATIO EXPERIENCED AND NO ADJUSTMENT HAD BEEN NEEDED. HOWEVER, OUR

ACTUAL REDUNDANCY RATIO, WHICH HAD CONTINUALLY IMPROVED DURING THE FIRST NINE

MONTHS OF 2003, TOOK AN ADVERSE TURN DURING NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, CAUSING

THE REQUIRED RESERVE REDUNDANCY TO INCREASE ABOVE OUR LEVEL OF TOLERANCE. THE

VIEW THAT THE REDUNDANCY RATIO WOULD NOT ONLY FAIL TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE, BUT

COULD LIKELY DECAY OVER TIME CAUSED US TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE RESERVE

LEVELS. THE NEW REQUIRED REDUNDANCY RATIO, AFTER THE $350 MILLION OF RESERVE

STRENGTHENING RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, IS IN THE RANGE OF 30% TO 35%.

THE THREE INDICATORS

DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE RELATED SUCH THAT IF ONE DETERIORATES, ADDITIONAL

IMPROVEMENT ON ANOTHER IS NECESSARY FOR US TO CONCLUDE THAT FURTHER RESERVE

STRENGTHENING IS NOT NECESSARY. THE RESULTS OF THESE INDICATORS SUPPORT OUR

CURRENT VIEW THAT WE HAVE RECORDED A REASONABLE PROVISION FOR OUR MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE EXPOSURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND OUR ANALYSIS CONTINUES

TO SUPPORT OUR BELIEF THAT WE WILL REALIZE FAVORABLE EFFECTS IN OUR ULTIMATE

COSTS AND THAT OUR CURRENT LOSS RESERVES WILL PROVE TO BE A REASONABLE

PROVISION.

REINSURANCE

IN THE YEARS PRIOR TO 2002, OUR REINSURANCE SEGMENT (ST.

PAUL RE) GENERALLY UNDERWROTE TREATY AND FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE FOR PROPERTY,

LIABILITY, OCEAN MARINE, SURETY, CERTAIN SPECIALTY CLASSES OF COVERAGE, AND NONTRADITIONAL

REINSURANCE, WHICH PROVIDED LIMITED TRADITIONAL UNDERWRITING RISK PROTECTION

COMBINED WITH FINANCIAL RISK PROTECTION. IN LATE 2001, WE ANNOUNCED OUR

INTENTION TO CEASE UNDERWRITING CERTAIN TYPES OF REINSURANCE COVERAGES AND NARROW

OUR GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE IN 2002, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL EARLIER IN THIS

DISCUSSION. AS A RESULT, IN JANUARY 2002, ST. PAUL RE BEGAN FOCUSING

ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF REINSURANCE COVERAGE: PROPERTY

CATASTROPHE, EXCESS-OF-LOSS CASUALTY, MARINE AND TRADITIONAL FINITE. ST. PAUL

RE CONDUCTED ITS BUSINESS THROUGH FOUR BUSINESS CENTERS: NORTH AMERICAN

CASUALTY, NORTH AMERICAN PROPERTY, INTERNATIONAL AND FINITE RISK. AS DISCUSSED

IN MORE DETAIL EARLIER IN THIS REPORT, IN NOVEMBER 2002, WE TRANSFERRED

OUR ONGOING REINSURANCE OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD. (PLATINUM)

WHILE RETAINING LIABILITIES GENERALLY FOR REINSURANCE CONTRACTS INCEPTING PRIOR

TO JANUARY 1, 2002. REPORTED RESULTS FOR OUR REINSURANCE OPERATION IN 2003

REPRESENT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON REINSURANCE BUSINESS

UNDERWRITTEN PRIOR TO THE TRANSFER OF BUSINESS TO PLATINUM. REPORTED RESULTS

FOR 2002 INCLUDE THOSE ELEMENTS, AS WELL AS ACTIVITY FROM THE PERIOD JANUARY 1,

2002 UP TO THE DATE OF TRANSFER TO PLATINUM.

2003THE UNDERWRITING PROFIT OF $3 MILLION IN 2003 WAS

DRIVEN BY $8 MILLION OF FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT ON PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES

RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACK. RESULTS IN 2003 ALSO

INCLUDED A $6 MILLION UNDERWRITING LOSS RELATED TO THE TRANSFER OF ADDITIONAL

ASSETS AND RESERVES TO PLATINUM PURSUANT TO AN ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM AS

DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL EARLIER IN THIS REPORT.

2002 VS. 2001



THE

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2002 COMPARED WITH 2001 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED VOLUME FROM THE LINES OF BUSINESS TARGETED FOR EXIT AT

THE END OF 2001. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE IN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2002 WAS

THE RESCISSION OF SEVERAL LARGE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS, WHICH REDUCED WRITTEN

PREMIUMS BY $137 MILLION. IN ADDITION, ST. PAUL RE CEDED WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF

$158 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER RELATED TO THE TRANSFER OF BUSINESS TO

PLATINUM, REPRESENTING UNEARNED PREMIUMS AS OF THE DATE OF TRANSFER ON BUSINESS

INCEPTING SUBSEQUENT TO JANUARY 1, 2002. THESE

80

REDUCTIONS IN PREMIUMS

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASES ON THE NARROWED LINES OF

BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN 2002 PRIOR TO THE TRANSFER TO PLATINUM, AND NEW

BUSINESS IN THE ACCIDENT AND HEALTH REINSURANCE MARKET.

ST. PAUL RES UNDERWRITING LOSS OF $22 MILLION IN 2002

INCLUDED A $40 MILLION DETRIMENT FROM AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE

TREATIES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE COMMUTATION OF A PORTION OF ONE AGGREGATE

EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATY THAT WAS EXCLUSIVE TO OUR REINSURANCE

OPERATIONS. THE 2002 RESULT ALSO INCLUDED $23 MILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11,

2001 TERRORIST ATTACK, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE LOSS EXPERIENCE

ON BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN 2002, DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASES AND BENEFITS

DERIVED FROM EXITING UNPROFITABLE LINES OF BUSINESS. CATASTROPHE AND OTHER

WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES IN 2002 TOTALED $31 MILLION, COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH FLOODING IN EUROPE IN AUGUST. THE UNDERWRITING LOSS OF

$726 MILLION IN 2001 WAS DOMINATED BY $556 MILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11,

2001 TERRORIST ATTACK. OTHER CATASTROPHE AND WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES OF $66

MILLION IN 2001 WERE DRIVEN BY LOSSES FROM THE EXPLOSION OF A CHEMICAL PLANT IN

FRANCE AND TROPICAL STORM ALLISON IN THE UNITED STATES. THE REMAINDER OF

UNDERWRITING LOSSES IN 2001 WERE CONCENTRATED IN NORTH AMERICAN CASUALTY AND

PROPERTY REINSURANCE BUSINESS.

OTHER RUNOFF

THIS CATEGORY INCLUDES THE RESULTS OF THE FOLLOWING

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS: 1) OUR RUNOFF OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS,

PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF THE FOLLOWING LINES OF BUSINESS WRITTEN THROUGH FOUR

SYNDICATES, ACROSS WHICH OUR OWNERSHIP RANGED FROM 54% TO 100% AND WHICH CEASED

UNDERWRITING IN 2001 OR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002: CASUALTY INSURANCE AND

REINSURANCE, NON-MARINE REINSURANCE, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE

(PARTICULARLY FOR FINANCIAL CUSTOMERS, AND DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY

INSURANCE) AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE INSURING OF THE LLOYDS CENTRAL FUND;

2) UNIONAMERICA, THE LONDON-BASED UNDERWRITING UNIT ACQUIRED AS PART OF OUR

PURCHASE OF MMI IN 2000. UNIONAMERICA UNDERWROTE LIABILITY AND PROPERTY

COVERAGES, INCLUDING MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND

AN INSURANCE AND EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE BASIS; 3) ALL OTHER INTERNATIONAL

RUNOFF LINES OF BUSINESS WE DECIDED TO EXIT AT THE END OF 2001, CONSISTING OF

HEALTH CARE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND IRELAND, AS WELL AS OUR

UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS IN GERMANY, FRANCE, THE NETHERLANDS, ARGENTINA, MEXICO

(EXCLUDING SURETY BUSINESS), SPAIN, AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, BOTSWANA AND SOUTH

AFRICA. (IN 2003, WE SOLD OUR OPERATIONS IN BOTSWANA, AND IN 2002, WE SOLD OUR

OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA, MEXICO AND SPAIN); AND 4) THE RESULTS OF OUR

PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS, AS WELL AS LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON

BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN PRIOR TO 1980 (PRIOR TO 1988 FOR BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN OUR

MERGER WITH USF&G CORPORATION IN 1998). WE HAVE A MANAGEMENT TEAM IN PLACE

FOR THE OPERATIONS COMPRISING THIS CATEGORY TO ENSURE THAT OUR OUTSTANDING

CLAIM OBLIGATIONS ARE SETTLED IN AN EXPEDITIOUS AND ECONOMICAL MANNER.

2003 VS.

2002DESPITE

PLACING ALL OF THE OPERATIONS IN THIS CATEGORY IN RUNOFF AT THE BEGINNING OF

2002, WE CONTINUE TO UNDERWRITE BUSINESS IN SELECTED MARKETS WHILE WE ATTEMPT

TO SELL CERTAIN OF THOSE OPERATIONS, ACCOUNTING FOR THE $60 MILLION OF PREMIUM

VOLUME IN 2003. THE $374 MILLION UNDERWRITING LOSS INCLUDED $285 MILLION IN PROVISIONS

TO STRENGTHEN PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES AND $89 MILLION OF CURRENT YEAR LOSSES

AND UNDERWRITING EXPENSES.

LLOYDS ACCOUNTED FOR $159 MILLION OF THE UNDERWRITING

LOSS IN 2003, DRIVEN BY $108 MILLION OF ADVERSE LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON BUSINESS

WRITTEN IN PRIOR YEARS AND POOR CURRENT-YEAR RESULTS FROM NORTH AMERICAN

LIABILITY BUSINESS, AND FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS, AS WELL AS AN

INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE. (THE ELIMINATION OF

THE ONE-QUARTER REPORTING LAG FOR OUR OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS ACCOUNTED FOR $48

MILLION OF OUR REPORTED UNDERWRITING LOSS FOR LLOYDS IN THIS CATEGORY IN 2003).

UNIONAMERICAS UNDERWRITING LOSS IN 2003 OF $104 MILLION INCLUDED $67 MILLION

OF ADVERSE PRIOR YEAR LOSS DEVELOPMENT AND A $21 MILLION INCREASE IN THE

PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE, WITH THE REMAINDER REFLECTING CURRENT

YEAR LOSSES RELATED TO STRENGTHENED LOSS ASSUMPTIONS ON CONTRACTS STILL IN

EFFECT IN 2003.

81

THESE CURRENT YEAR LOSSES

ARE CENTERED IN THREE LINES OF BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN THROUGH THE LLOYDS MARKET

THAT ARE NOW MANAGED BY UNIONAMERICA: INSURANCE OF NON-U.S. MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE, EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY

BUSINESS, AND U.S. SURPLUS LINES BUSINESS. ALL OTHER INTERNATIONAL RUNOFF LINES

OF BUSINESS ACCOUNTED FOR $58 MILLION OF UNDERWRITING LOSSES IN 2003, COMPARED

WITH $56 MILLION OF LOSSES IN 2002. THE UNDERWRITING LOSS ON DOMESTIC LINES UNDERWRITTEN

PRIOR TO 1980 (PRIOR TO 1988 FOR BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN OUR MERGER WITH USF&G

CORPORATION IN 1998) WAS $53 MILLION, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF

$46 MILLION OF ADVERSE PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN

INCREASE IN ASBESTOS RESERVES DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003. ADVERSE PRIOR-YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $43 MILLION IN OUR OTHER INTERNATIONAL LINES OCCURRED

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN VARIOUS LINES OF BUSINESS AND IN VARIOUS INCREMENTS.

2002

VS.

2001THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2002 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF OUR DECISION TO PLACE

THESE BUSINESSES IN RUNOFF. INTERNATIONAL RUNOFF LINES OF BUSINESS ACCOUNTED

FOR $110 MILLION OF WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2002, DOWN 54% FROM $240 MILLION

IN 2001. WE CONTINUED TO UNDERWRITE BUSINESS IN SELECTED MARKETS WHILE WE

ATTEMPTED TO SELL CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS. OUR LLOYDS RUNOFF PREMIUM TOTALED

$114 MILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $253 MILLION IN 2001. UNIONAMERICA

SYNDICATE PREMIUM VOLUME TOTALED $18 MILLION IN 2002, DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM

2001 PREMIUMS OF $99 MILLION.

LLOYDS ACCOUNTED FOR $99 MILLION OF THE UNDERWRITING

LOSS IN 2002, DRIVEN BY ADVERSE LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON BUSINESS WRITTEN IN PRIOR

YEARS AND POOR CURRENT-YEAR RESULTS FROM NORTH AMERICAN LIABILITY AND

REINSURANCE BUSINESS. UNIONAMERICAS UNDERWRITING LOSS IN 2002 OF $60 MILLION

INCLUDED $27 MILLION OF ADVERSE PRIOR YEAR LOSS DEVELOPMENT, WITH THE REMAINDER

REFLECTING CURRENT YEAR LOSSES RELATED TO STRENGTHENED LOSS ASSUMPTIONS RELATED

TO CONTRACTS STILL IN EFFECT IN 2002. THESE LOSSES ARE CENTERED IN THREE LINES

OF BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN THROUGH LLOYDS SYNDICATES THAT ARE NOW MANAGED BY

UNIONAMERICA: EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE ON U.S. MEDICAL MALPRACTICE, DIRECTORS

AND OFFICERS LIABILITY BUSINESS, AND U.S. SURPLUS LINES BUSINESS. ALL OTHER

INTERNATIONAL RUNOFF LINES OF BUSINESS ACCOUNTED FOR $56 MILLION OF

UNDERWRITING LOSSES IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $94 MILLION OF LOSSES IN 2001. LOSSES

IN 2002 WERE CENTERED IN THE NETHERLANDS AND SPAIN, WHEREAS IN 2001 LOSSES WERE

CONCENTRATED IN HEALTH CARE BUSINESS AND CONSTRUCTION COVERAGES OFFERED IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM. THE DECLINE IN THESE OTHER INTERNATIONAL RUNOFF LOSSES IN 2002

REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF OUR DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM THOSE MARKETS.

OUR

PORTFOLIO OF FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF HIGH-QUALITY,

INTERMEDIATE-TERM TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, CORPORATE AND MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS,

AND TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS. WE MANAGE THIS PORTFOLIO CONSERVATIVELY,

INVESTING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, APPROXIMATELY 96% OF OUR

FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO, COMPRISED OF OUR FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, THE

SECURITIES ON LOAN AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WAS RATED INVESTMENT GRADE. APPROXIMATELY

3% CONSISTED OF NON-INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES AND 1% WERE NON-RATED

SECURITIES.

WE PARTICIPATE IN A SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM WHEREBY

CERTAIN FIXED INCOME SECURITIES FROM OUR PORTFOLIO ARE LOANED TO OTHER

INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. WE RECEIVE A FEE FROM THE BORROWER IN

RETURN. WE REQUIRE COLLATERAL EQUAL TO 102% OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LOANED

SECURITIES, AND WE RECORD THE CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED AS A LIABILITY. THE

COLLATERAL IS INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND REPORTED AS SUCH ON OUR

BALANCE SHEET. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SECURITIES ON LOAN IS REMOVED FROM

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND SHOWN AS A SEPARATE INVESTMENT

ASSET. WE CONTINUE TO EARN INTEREST ON THE SECURITIES ON LOAN, AND EARN A

PORTION OF THE INTEREST RELATED TO THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.

AT THE END OF 2003, THE REPORTED AMORTIZED COST OF OUR

FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO WAS $15.6 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $16.1 BILLION AT THE

END OF 2002. THE DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR INCREASED

83

PARTICIPATION IN THE

SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM DESCRIBED ABOVE AND THE RESULTING RECLASSIFICATION

OF THOSE SECURITIES TO A SEPARATE BALANCE SHEET CAPTION. WE CARRY THESE

SECURITIES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE APPRECIATION OR

DEPRECIATION RECORDED IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, NET OF TAXES. THE FAIR VALUES OF

OUR BONDS FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, CHANGES IN YIELD

DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN FIXED INCOME ASSET CLASSES AND CHANGES IN THE PERCEIVED

CREDITWORTHINESS OF CORPORATE OBLIGORS. AT THE END OF 2003, THE PRETAX

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO WAS $862 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF $1.0 BILLION AT THE END OF 2002, WITH

THE DECLINE DUE TO HIGHER MARKET INTEREST RATES IN 2003. THE 10-YEAR U.S.

TREASURY YIELD ROSE 43 BASIS POINTS DURING 2003. IN 2002, BY CONTRAST, THAT

SAME U.S. TREASURY YIELD DECLINED BY 123 BASIS POINTS, CAUSING A SIGNIFICANT

INCREASE IN THE UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF THE PORTFOLIO OVER YEAR-END 2001.

OUR DECISION WHETHER TO PURCHASE TAXABLE OR TAX-EXEMPT

SECURITIES IS DRIVEN BY CORPORATE TAX CONSIDERATIONS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP

BETWEEN TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT YIELDS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. IN RECENT YEARS,

THE AVAILABILITY OF CORPORATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND ALTERNATIVE

MINIMUM TAX CARRYFORWARDS HAS INCREASED OUR ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM TAXABLE

INVESTMENT INCOME. ACCORDINGLY, A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF OUR NEW FIXED INCOME

PURCHASES IN RECENT YEARS HAVE CONSISTED OF TAXABLE BONDS. THE AVERAGE YIELD ON

TAXABLE BONDS PURCHASED IN 2003 WAS 4.5%, COMPARED WITH 5.3% IN 2002 AND 6.5%

IN 2001. THE DECLINE OF THESE AVERAGE INVESTMENT YIELDS IN BOTH 2003 AND 2002

REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE RATE ACTIONS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC

WEAKNESS. TAXABLE BONDS ACCOUNTED FOR 77% OF OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO AT

YEAR-END 2003, COMPARED WITH 75% AT THE END OF 2002. THE BOND PORTFOLIO IN

TOTAL CARRIED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRETAX YIELD OF 5.7% AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, COMPARED WITH 6.2% AT THE END OF 2002.

PRETAX INVESTMENT INCOME GENERATED BY OUR FIXED INCOME

SECURITIES, SECURITIES ON LOAN AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN 2003 TOTALED $1.02

BILLION, DOWN 7% FROM 2002 INVESTMENT INCOME OF $1.09 BILLION. OUR INVESTMENT

INCOME IN 2003 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY YIELDS ON NEW INVESTMENTS PURCHASED

DURING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WHICH WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN YIELDS ON

INVESTMENTS THAT MATURED IN THOSE YEARS. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS, INCLUDING PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR RUNOFF

OPERATIONS AND THE $747 MILLION WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS SETTLEMENT PAYMENT,

PREVENTED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR INVESTED ASSET BASE DURING 2003. IN 2002,

PRETAX INVESTMENT INCOME FROM FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS WAS 1% BELOW 2001 INCOME

OF $1.11 BILLION. THE EFFECT OF THE DECLINE IN YIELDS AVAILABLE ON NEW

INVESTMENTS IN 2002 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN FUNDS INVESTED,

LARGELY DUE TO THE CAPITAL INFUSION AND SALES OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR FIXED INCOME

PORTFOLIO IS DISCLOSED IN THE

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

SECTION OF THIS DISCUSSION.

REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE LOANS

R

EAL ESTATE ($775 MILLION) AND MORTGAGE LOANS ($63 MILLION)

ACCOUNTED FOR 4% OF OUR TOTAL PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS AT THE END OF 2003.

OUR REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND WAREHOUSE

PROPERTIES THAT WE OWN DIRECTLY OR IN WHICH WE HAVE A PARTIAL INTEREST THROUGH

JOINT VENTURES. OUR PROPERTIES ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE

UNITED STATES AND HAD AN OCCUPANCY RATE OF 89.7% AT YEAR-END 2003, COMPARED

WITH 89.9% IN 2002. REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS PRODUCED PRETAX INVESTMENT INCOME

OF $61 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $67 MILLION IN 2002. OUR REAL ESTATE

INVESTMENT CASH FLOWS OF $106 MILLION IN 2003 WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN CASH

FLOWS OF $105 MILLION IN 2002. THESE CASH FLOWS EQUATED TO CASH YIELDS OF 10.8%

AND 10.4% FOR 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. WE MADE NO SIGNIFICANT REAL ESTATE

PURCHASES IN 2003 OR 2002.

WE ACQUIRED OUR PORTFOLIO OF MORTGAGE LOANS IN THE

1998 MERGER WITH USF&G. THE LOANS, WHICH ARE COLLATERALIZED BY

INCOME-PRODUCING REAL ESTATE, PRODUCED INVESTMENT INCOME OF $6 MILLION IN 2003

AND $10 MILLION IN 2002. NET PAY DOWNS AND REPAYMENTS OF THE LOANS TOTALED $19

MILLION IN 2003 AND $52 MILLION IN 2002. WE DID NOT ORIGINATE ANY NEW LOANS IN

EITHER OF THE LAST TWO YEARS.

84

VENTURE CAPITAL

V

ENTURE

CAPITAL COMPRISED 2% OF OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTED ASSETS (AT COST) AT THE

END OF 2003. THESE PRIVATE INVESTMENTS SPAN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES BUT ARE

CONCENTRATED IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HEALTH CARE AND

CONSUMER PRODUCTS. IN 2003, WE INVESTED $134 MILLION IN THIS ASSET CLASS,

COMPARED WITH $138 MILLION IN 2002. OUR TOTAL RETURN ON AVERAGE NET VENTURE

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS (ENCOMPASSING DIVIDEND INCOME, REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES,

AND THE CHANGE IN UNREALIZED APPRECIATION) WAS 12.3% IN 2003, (41.0%) IN 2002

AND (41.5%) IN 2001. THE POSITIVE RETURN IN 2003 WAS DRIVEN BY NET PRETAX

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OF $51 MILLION, THE COMPONENTS OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED

IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. VENTURE CAPITAL RETURNS IN 2002 AND 2001 WERE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF OUR

INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY IN 2002, LOSSES FROM INVESTMENTS SALES AND IMPAIRMENT

WRITE-DOWNS WERE SIGNIFICANT, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW. THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO AT YEAR-END 2003 AND 2002 INCLUDED

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF $24 MILLION AND $4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE HAD LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS

TO FUND VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TOTALING $792 MILLION WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN TERMINATION PROVISIONS AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 16 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT.

EQUITIES



OUR

EQUITY HOLDINGS CONSIST OF A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF PUBLIC COMMON STOCK,

COMPRISING LESS THAN 1% OF TOTAL PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS (AT COST) AT

YEAR-END 2003. IN MID-2002, WE BEGAN TO REDUCE OUR LEVEL OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

OUR DECISION WAS PROMPTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR OPINION AS TO THE

NEAR-TERM DIRECTION OF EQUITY PRICES, A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF OUR

AGGREGATE EQUITY EXPOSURE (INCLUDING VENTURE CAPITAL AND EQUITIES HELD BY OUR

PENSION FUND), AND OUR OPINION AS TO THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS

THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLICLY HELD INSURANCE COMPANIES. BY THE END OF 2003,

WE HAD REDUCED OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS BY $953 MILLION (AT COST) SINCE YEAR-END

2001.

THE TOTAL RETURN ON OUR COMBINED DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY PORTFOLIO WAS 32% IN 2003, COMPARED WITH (19.4%) IN 2002

AND (20.7%) IN 2001. AT THE END OF 2003, THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR REMAINING

PORTFOLIO OF $105 MILLION EXCEEDED ITS COST BY $17 MILLION. BY COMPARISON, AT

THE END OF 2002, THE $375 MILLION COST OF OUR EQUITY HOLDINGS EXCEEDED ITS

MARKET VALUE BY $20 MILLION.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

OUR

14% EQUITY OWNERSHIP STAKE IN PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD., WITH A

CARRYING VALUE OF $146 MILLION AND $129 MILLION, AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

2002, RESPECTIVELY, IS INCLUDED IN THIS CATEGORY, AS IS A LONG-TERM

INTEREST-BEARING SECURITY FROM A HIGHLY-RATED ENTITY, SUPPORTING A SERIES OF

INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS, WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF $359 MILLION AND $386 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THIS SECURITY

IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE IN PROPORTION TO THE REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT

OF INSURANCE WHICH IT SUPPORTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE OUR

WARRANTS TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL PLATINUM SHARES, WHICH ARE CARRIED AT THEIR

MARKET VALUE ($65 MILLION AND $61 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002,

2003.

DURING 2003, WE SOLD FIXED

INCOME SECURITIES WITH A CUMULATIVE AMORTIZED COST OF $940 MILLION, GENERATING

GROSS PRETAX GAINS OF $39 MILLION. THESE GAINS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS TOTALING $17 MILLION, INCLUDING $9 MILLION RELATED TO

ASSET/MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES AND $4 MILLION RELATED TO HEALTHSOUTH

CORPORATION. WE RECORDED ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS TOTALING $4 MILLION

IN OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO DURING 2003 RELATED TO NINE OTHER ISSUERS. EACH

OF THESE WRITE-DOWNS WAS CARRIED OUT BY WRITING OUR STATED BOOK VALUE DOWN TO

OUR ESTIMATE OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE. WE CONTINUED TO REDUCE OUR EQUITY

INVESTMENT HOLDINGS IN 2003, AND SALES OF THOSE INVESTMENTS IN A REBOUNDING

MARKET ENVIRONMENT RESULTED IN NET PRETAX GAINS OF $40 MILLION FOR THE YEAR. IMPAIRMENT

WRITE-DOWNS IN OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO TOTALED $6 MILLION IN 2003. IN OUR VENTURE

CAPITAL PORTFOLIO, THE SALE OF A LARGE PORTION OF ONE OF OUR INVESTMENT

HOLDINGS GENERATED A PRETAX GAIN OF $171 MILLION IN 2003, WHICH WAS LARGELY

OFFSET BY IMPAIRMENT REALIZED LOSSES TOTALING $143 MILLION RELATED TO 38 OF OUR

INVESTMENT HOLDINGS. FOURTEEN OF THOSE HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO A MERGER

OR SALE AT A VALUE LESS THAN OUR COST. ELEVEN HOLDINGS EXPERIENCED FUNDAMENTAL

ECONOMIC DETERIORATION (CHARACTERIZED BY GROSS MARGINS BEING LESS THAN

EXPECTED, PRODUCT PRICING NOT MEETING INITIAL PROJECTIONS DUE TO MARKET

CONDITIONS, AND GREATER THAN EXPECTED MANUFACTURING EXPENSES). SIX HOLDINGS

WERE WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE THE ENTITIES PROGRESS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN

PLANNED AND ADDITIONAL FINANCING WAS REQUIRED AT VALUES LESS THAN OUR COST. AN

ADDITIONAL SIX HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO CESSATION OF OPERATIONS OF THE

ENTITY. FINALLY, ONE HOLDING WAS IMPAIRED BECAUSE MARKET DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCT

WAS LESS THAN EXPECTED.

2002.

DURING 2002, WE SOLD FIXED INCOME SECURITIES WITH A

CUMULATIVE AMORTIZED COST OF $2.5 BILLION, GENERATING GROSS PRETAX GAINS OF

$185 MILLION. THESE GAINS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS

TOTALING $74 MILLION, INCLUDING $15 MILLION RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN DEBT

SECURITIES ISSUED BY WORLDCOM CORPORATION, $13 MILLION RELATED TO TXU EASTERN FUNDING

AND $10 MILLION RELATED TO NRG ENERGY. WE RECORDED ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT

WRITE-DOWNS TOTALING $36 MILLION IN OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO DURING 2002

RELATED TO 22 OTHER ISSUERS. THOSE WRITE-DOWNS RESULTED FROM BANKRUPTCY FILINGS

OR SUBSTANTIAL DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THOSE ISSUERS.  REALIZED LOSSES FROM OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO IN

2002 PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF THOSE RESULTING FROM SALES FOLLOWING THE STRATEGIC

DECISION TO RE-ALLOCATE FUNDS TO THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, AND IMPAIRMENT

WRITE-DOWNS TOTALING $26 MILLION.

IN OUR VENTURE CAPITAL

PORTFOLIO, REALIZED LOSSES IN 2002 INCLUDED $56 MILLION OF LOSSES RESULTING

FROM THE SALE OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENT HOLDINGS, AND

IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS IN 25 OF OUR HOLDINGS TOTALING $122 MILLION. THESE

HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED FOR THE SAME GENERAL REASONS NOTED ABOVE FOR THE 2003

IMPAIRMENTS: SEVEN HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED BECAUSE MARKET DEMAND FOR THEIR

PRODUCTS WAS LESS THAN EXPECTED; SEVEN HOLDINGS WERE WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE THE ENTITIES

PROGRESS WAS LESS THAN PLANNED AND ADDITIONAL FINANCING WOULD BE REQUIRED; FIVE

HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC DETERIORATION (AS DEFINED

ABOVE); FOUR HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO A MERGER OR SALE AT LESS THAN OUR

COST; AND TWO HOLDINGS WERE IMPAIRED DUE TO CESSATION OF OPERATIONS.

2001.

PRETAX REALIZED LOSSES IN THE FIXED INCOME CATEGORY IN

2001 WERE DRIVEN BY WRITE-DOWNS IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR BOND

HOLDINGS, INCLUDING A $20 MILLION WRITE-DOWN OF VARIOUS ARGENTINA GOVERNMENT

AND CORPORATE BONDS FOLLOWING ECONOMIC UPHEAVAL IN THAT COUNTRY, AND A $19

MILLION WRITE-DOWN IN DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY ENRON CORPORATION FOLLOWING

THAT COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY FILING. WE RECORDED ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS

TOTALING $38 MILLION IN OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO DURING 2001 RELATED TO 19

OTHER ISSUERS. WE DID NOT RECORD ANY IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS IN OUR EQUITY

PORTFOLIO IN 2001. REALIZED LOSSES IN OUR VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY

RESULTED FROM IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE

86

TOTALED $88 MILLION,

RELATED TO 31 OF OUR DIRECT VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. THESE HOLDINGS WERE

IMPAIRED FOR THE SAME REASONS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR 2003 AND 2002.

FOR PUBLICLY-TRADED SECURITIES IN OUR VENTURE CAPITAL

PORTFOLIO IN EACH YEAR, THE AMOUNTS OF WRITE-DOWNS WERE DETERMINED BY WRITING

OUR INVESTMENTS DOWN TO QUOTED MARKET PRICES. FOR NON-PUBLICLY-TRADED

SECURITIES, THE WRITE-DOWNS TO ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE WERE REVIEWED AND

APPROVED BY OUR INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE, WHICH, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS,

EVALUATES RECENT FINANCINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET STABILITY,

GROWTH, AND OTHER BUSINESS AND SECTOR FUNDAMENTALS IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUES

OF THE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, OUR VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO

MANAGERS MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES OF BOTH OUR PUBLICLY-TRADED AND

NON-PUBLICLY-TRADED SECURITIES, KEEPING IN MIND DEVELOPMENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE

RISE TO NECESSARY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS. THESE MANAGERS MAY REPORT ANY SUCH

DEVELOPMENTS TO THE INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE.

A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING PROCEDURES EMPLOYED TO EVALUATE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS IS

CONTAINED IN THE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES

SECTION OF THIS DISCUSSION.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY

UNDERWRITING

LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

OUR LOSS RESERVES REFLECT ESTIMATES OF TOTAL LOSSES

AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WE WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE TO PAY UNDER INSURANCE

POLICIES, SURETY BONDS AND REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THESE INCLUDE LOSSES THAT

HAVE BEEN REPORTED BUT NOT SETTLED, AND LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT

YET REPORTED TO US (IBNR). LOSS RESERVES FOR CERTAIN WORKERS COMPENSATION

BUSINESS AND CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT

VALUE. WE REDUCE OUR LOSS RESERVES FOR ESTIMATES OF SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.

FOR REPORTED LOSSES, WE ESTABLISH RESERVES ON A CASE

BASIS WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF COVERAGE PROVIDED IN THE INSURANCE POLICY,

SURETY BOND OR REINSURANCE AGREEMENT. FOR IBNR LOSSES, WE ESTIMATE RESERVES

USING ESTABLISHED ACTUARIAL METHODS. OUR CASE AND IBNR RESERVE ESTIMATES

CONSIDER SUCH VARIABLES AS PAST LOSS EXPERIENCE, CHANGES IN LEGISLATIVE

CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL LIABILITY AND POLICY

COVERAGES, AND INFLATION. WE CONSIDER NOT ONLY MONETARY INCREASES IN THE COST

OF WHAT WE INSURE, BUT ALSO CHANGES IN SOCIETAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE JURY

VERDICTS AND CASE LAW AND, IN TURN, CLAIM COSTS.

BECAUSE MANY OF THE COVERAGES WE OFFER INVOLVE CLAIMS

THAT MAY NOT ULTIMATELY BE SETTLED FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THEY ARE INCURRED,

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AS TO OUR ULTIMATE EXPOSURE TO LOSSES ARE AN INTEGRAL AND

NECESSARY COMPONENT OF OUR LOSS RESERVING PROCESS. WE RECORD OUR RESERVES BY

CONSIDERING A RANGE OF ESTIMATES BOUNDED BY A HIGH AND LOW POINT. WITHIN THAT

RANGE, WE RECORD OUR BEST ESTIMATE. WE CONTINUALLY REVIEW OUR RESERVES, USING A

VARIETY OF STATISTICAL AND ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES TO ANALYZE CURRENT CLAIM COSTS,

FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY DATA, AND PREVAILING ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND LEGAL FACTORS.

WE ADJUST RESERVES ESTABLISHED IN PRIOR YEARS AS LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND

NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED RESERVES

ARE REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THEY ARE MADE.

WHILE OUR REPORTED RESERVES MAKE

A REASONABLE PROVISION FOR ALL OF OUR UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

OBLIGATIONS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING REQUIRED

RESERVES DOES, BY ITS VERY NATURE, INVOLVE UNCERTAINTY. THE LEVEL OF

UNCERTAINTY CAN BE INFLUENCED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE EXISTENCE OF LONG TAIL

COVERAGE FORMS AND CHANGES IN CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES. MANY OF OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES HAVE WRITTEN LONG-TAIL COVERAGES SUCH AS MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL

LIABILITY, LARGE DEDUCTIBLE WORKERS COMPENSATION AND ASSUMED REINSURANCE. IN

ADDITION, CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES CHANGE AND EVOLVE OVER THE YEARS. FOR

EXAMPLE, NEW INITIATIVES ARE COMMENCED, CLAIM OFFICES ARE REORGANIZED AND

RELOCATED, CLAIM HANDLING RESPONSIBILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL ADJUSTERS ARE CHANGED,

USE OF A CALL CENTER IS INCREASED, USE OF TECHNOLOGY IS INCREASED, CASELOAD

ISSUES AND CASE RESERVING PRACTICES ARE MONITORED MORE FREQUENTLY, ETC.

87

HOWEVER,

THESE ARE SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY THAT WE HAVE RECOGNIZED AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE

APPROPRIATELY RESERVED.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPOSITION OF OUR GROSS AND NET LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES BY MAJOR PRODUCT LINE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003

ANALYSIS OF OUR

LONG-TAIL EXPOSURES

WE CONSIDER LONG-TAIL EXPOSURES TO INCLUDE THOSE

LINES OF BUSINESS IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF COVERAGE INVOLVES AVERAGE LOSS

PAYMENT LAGS OF THREE YEARS OR MORE BEYOND THE EXPIRATION OF THE POLICY AND,

ACCORDINGLY, CAN CAUSE AN INCREASED LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY IN ESTIMATING LOSS

RESERVES. THE PRIMARY LINES OF OUR BUSINESS FITTING THOSE CRITERIA ARE GENERAL

LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, AND CASUALTY EXCESS REINSURANCE. FOR THE MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE BUSINESS WE UNDERWROTE PRIOR TO OUR EXIT FROM THAT LINE OF

BUSINESS, RESERVES DO NOT EXCEED A THREE-YEAR AVERAGE LIFE, BUT DO INVOLVE A

HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY. WE ANALYZE THESE RESERVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR

ACCOUNTING POLICY AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

SECTION OF THIS DISCUSSION.

88

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL STATISTICS ON

OUR LONG TAIL AND MEDICAL MALPRACTICE EXPOSURES AND IS FOLLOWED BY DISCUSSION

ON KNOWN TRENDS, EVENTS, OR UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ALSO FURTHER DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF THE

UNDERLYING CLAIMS, INCLUDING RELEVANT INFORMATION OF THE CLAIMANT POPULATION. FOR

OUR GENERAL LIABILITY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION LINES OF BUSINESS, WE HAVE

REPORTED SEPARATELY OUR EXPOSURES TO POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS (E&A)

OBLIGATIONS. FOR OUR NON-E&A GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, AND

MEDICAL MALPRACTICE COVERAGES, WE HAVE INCLUDED DATA ONLY FOR OUR PRIMARY

DOMESTIC INSURANCE OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER INSURANCE

PRODUCTS.

THE COVERAGES IN THE TABLE REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 65% OF

OUR TOTAL NET LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31,

2003.

THE CLAIM COUNTS INCLUDED

IN THIS TABLE REPRESENT COUNTS OF SUPPLEMENTS, WHICH ARE EXTRACTED FROM OUR

ACTUARIAL DATABASES. A CLAIM SUPPLEMENT IS THE FINEST LEVEL OF DETAIL RECORDED

IN OUR STATISTICAL SYSTEMS. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO CLAIMANTS FOR A SINGLE GENERAL

LIABILITY BODILY INJURY OCCURRENCE WOULD BE COUNTED AS TWO SEPARATE SUPPLEMENTS.

OUR CLAIM DEPARTMENT MANAGES CLAIMS ON A POLICYHOLDER BASIS, WHILE THE DATA IN

THIS TABLE IS PRESENTED ON A CLAIM COUNT BASIS. FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS

CLAIMS, A CLAIM SUPPLEMENT COUNT DOES NOT REFLECT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS

INVOLVED ON THE ACCOUNT. FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS, SUPPLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY CREATED

BASED ON THE NUMBER OF POLICY YEARS POTENTIALLY IMPLICATED ON THE ACCOUNT. FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SUPPLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY CREATED TO TRACK THE NUMBER OF

SITES INVOLVED ON THE ACCOUNT.

(2)

THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND

ASBESTOS CLAIM COUNT INFORMATION INCLUDES ONLY LOSSES ON DIRECT WRITTEN

BUSINESS WHEREAS THE PAID LOSS DATA ON ASSUMED BUSINESS, PRESENTED SEPARATELY,

INCLUDES LOSS AND

89

DEFENSE AND COST

CONTAINMENT EXPENSES. CLAIM COUNT DATA IS NOT SHOWN ON LOSSES ASSUMED FROM

OTHER COMPANIES AND/OR INSURANCE POOLS BECAUSE WE ARE OFTEN EITHER COVERING A

VERY SMALL PORTION OF ANY ONE CLAIM, OR A NUMBER OF CLAIMS WHICH ARE COMPILED

TOGETHER AS ONE FOR REPORTING PURPOSES AND, THEREFORE, SUCH STATISTICS WOULD

NOT BE MEANINGFUL. ALSO, THE COSTS TO ADMINISTER THESE CLAIMS DO NOT INCLUDE

ADJUSTING AND OTHER RELATED PAYMENTS.

(3)

INCLUDES PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY LOSS EXPERIENCE SINCE CASUALTY ONLY IS NOT AVAILABLE. ALSO, CLAIM

COUNTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON ASSUMED REINSURANCE. LOSS SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS

INCLUDE DEFENSE AND COST CONTAINMENT EXPENSES WHEREAS COSTS TO ADMINISTER

INCLUDE ONLY ADJUSTING AND OTHER RELATED PAYMENTS.

GENERAL LIABILITY (NON-E&A)

INCLUDES

INSURANCE COVERAGE PROTECTING THE INSURED AGAINST LEGAL LIABILITY RESULTING

FROM NEGLIGENCE, CARELESSNESS, OR FAILURE TO ACT CAUSING PROPERTY DAMAGE OR

PERSONAL INJURY TO OTHERS. CLAIMS ON THESE COVERAGES ARE USUALLY PAID TO THIRD

PARTY CLAIMANTS. WHILE WE OFFER COVERAGE THAT MAY RESULT IN LOW-FREQUENCY,

HIGH-SEVERITY CLAIMS (I.E. EXCESS UMBRELLA, LARGE ACCOUNTS), THE MAJORITY OF

THE NON-E&A GENERAL LIABILITY BUSINESS IS GENERALLY STABLE AND PREDICTABLE

DUE TO THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS WRITTEN. ALTHOUGH THE COST OF ADMINISTERING THESE

CLAIMS COMPRISES A LARGE PORTION OF THE OVERALL CLAIM COST, THE ACTUAL AVERAGE

LOSS PAYMENT PER CLAIM IS GENERALLY LOW. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR THIS

LINE IS UNEXPECTED INCREASES IN INFLATION, EITHER ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL. THE NUMBER

OF NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN 2003 DRIVEN BY AN UNDERLYING

DECREASE IN OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSS. PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED IN THE LAST SEVERAL

YEARS DUE TO PRICING, BUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF EXPOSURES INSURED HAS DROPPED. PAID

LOSSES AND CLOSED CLAIMS DECLINED IN 2003 DUE TO A DECREASE IN REPORTED CLAIMS

IN RECENT YEARS. THE INCREASE IN PAID DOLLARS IN 2002 WAS THE RESULT OF CLOSING

MORE CLAIMS IN 2002 THAN WE DID IN 2001.

WORKERS COMPENSATION

INCLUDES

INSURANCE WHICH COVERS AN EMPLOYERS LIABILITY FOR INJURIES, DISABILITY OR

DEATH TO PERSONS IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT, WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT.  THE COVERAGE PROVIDED UNDER THE WORKERS

COMPENSATION POLICIES IS BASED ON STATE-SPECIFIC SCHEDULES FOR WAGE REPLACEMENT

AND MEDICAL PAYMENTS FOR INJURED WORKERS. WHILE THE LARGEST PORTION OF THE

WORKERS INSURED UNDER OUR POLICIES GENERATE A VERY LOW SEVERITY BODY OF CLAIMS,

A PORTION OF OUR PREMIUM VOLUME IS GENERATED IN OUR CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS

CENTER, WHERE THERE IS AN INCREASED POSSIBILITY OF PERMANENT AND TOTAL

DISABILITY REQUIRING LIFETIME PAYMENTS. ALTHOUGH EACH STATE GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE

CHANGES IN COVERAGE, THE CHANGES HAPPEN AFTER CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC DELIBERATION

AND VERY SELDOM WILL IMPACT POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD IN THE PAST. THE

NUMBER OF NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN 2003, DRIVEN BY AN

UNDERLYING DECREASE IN OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSS. PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED IN THE

LAST SEVERAL YEARS DUE TO PRICING, BUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF EXPOSURES INSURED

HAS DROPPED. THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS CLOSED IN 2003 DECLINED DUE TO A STEADILY

DECREASING NUMBER OF REPORTED CLAIMS IN RECENT YEARS. WE CLOSED ROUGHLY AS MANY

CLAIMS IN 2002 AS IN 2001, DRIVING THE NUMBER OF PENDING CLAIMS DOWN.

MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

INCLUDES

INSURANCE PROTECTING A LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OR HEALTH CARE FACILITY

AGAINST LEGAL LIABILITY RESULTING FROM DEATH OR INJURY OF ANY PERSON DUE TO THE

INSUREDS MISCONDUCT, NEGLIGENCE, OR INCOMPETENCE IN RENDERING PROFESSIONAL

SERVICES. MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLAIMS ARE VOLATILE IN NATURE. WHILE A LARGE

NUMBER ARE CLOSED WITHOUT A LOSS PAYMENT, THOSE WITH PAYMENTS MAY BE VERY LARGE

DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND JUDICIAL CLIMATE. SIGNIFICANT COST IS

EXPENDED IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, OFTEN WITH FAVORABLE OUTCOMES. SINCE

THIS BOOK OF BUSINESS IS IN RUNOFF, THE PENDING INVENTORY IS DECREASING AND

WILL BEGIN TO DISTORT SOME OF THE STATISTICS. AS THE RUNOFF MATURES, THERE WILL

BE FEWER SMALL CLAIMS AND FEWER MERITLESS CLAIMS THAT CAN BE QUICKLY DISMISSED.

THE SINGLE LARGEST RISK IN THIS LINE OF BUSINESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIAL

TRENDS IN JURY VERDICTS WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL IN OUR HEALTH CARE

SEGMENT DISCUSSION IN THIS REPORT. AS

REPORTED IN THE HEALTH CARE DISCUSSION REFERENCED ABOVE, NEWLY REPORTED CLAIM

COUNTS ARE DROPPING QUICKLY AS WE EXIT THIS BUSINESS SEGMENT. AS WE EXECUTE OUR

RUNOFF STRATEGY, WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE A DROP IN THE INVENTORY OF PENDING

CLAIMS. THE UNUSUALLY HIGH NUMBER OF CLAIMS REPORTED AND DISMISSED, SETTLED

OR RESOLVED IN 2001 IN THE FOREGOING TABLE WAS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE MMI

INTEGRATION.

90

ENVIRONMENTAL

THIS EXPOSURE

RELATES TO GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE ON POLICIES WHICH MAY BE INTERPRETED TO

COVER ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED EXPOSURES. THE INFORMATION PRESENTED ABOVE

REPRESENTS BUSINESS REPORTED AS NOT UNDERWRITTEN ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES AS DESCRIBED

IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION OF THIS REPORT. PAYMENT TOTALS FOR THESE COVERAGES ARE

DRIVEN BY A FEW VERY LARGE CLAIMS, ACCOMPANIED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF VERY SMALL

CLAIMS. WHILE THE NUMBER OF NEW REPORTED CLAIMS APPEARS TO INCREASE, THEY ARE

PRIMARILY MATTERS FOR WHICH THERE IS NO EXPECTATION OF CLAIM PAYMENT, OR FOR

POLICIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED AS CASES WHERE THE UNDERWRITER INTENDED

COVERAGE. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COST OF ADMINISTERING THESE CLAIMS

RELATES TO CLAIMS THAT ARE EVENTUALLY SETTLED WITHOUT PAYMENT. CHANGES IN

SOCIAL, JUDICIAL, LEGISLATIVE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN FUTURE

UNFORESEEN DEVELOPMENTS AND REQUIRE RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS.

ASBESTOS

THIS EXPOSURE RELATES TO

GENERAL LIABILITY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGES ON POLICIES WHICH CAN BE

INTERPRETED TO COVER ASBESTOS-RELATED EXPOSURES. THIS PORTION OF BUSINESS IS

DEFINED AS THAT WHICH IS REPORTED AS ASBESTOS LOSSES AS DESCRIBED IN MORE

DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION OF THIS REPORT. AMOUNTS ARE DRIVEN BY A FEW VERY

LARGE CLAIMS, ACCOMPANIED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF VERY SMALL CLAIMS OR CLAIMS MADE

WITH NO PAYMENT. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COST OF ADMINISTERING THE CLAIMS

IS SPENT ON THOSE CLAIMS THAT ARE EVENTUALLY SETTLED WITHOUT PAYMENT. SOCIAL,

JUDICIAL, LEGISLATIVE AND ECONOMIC CHANGES COULD RESULT IN FUTURE UNFORESEEN

DEVELOPMENTS AND REQUIRE RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS. WESTERN MACARTHUR ACCOUNTED FOR

THE MAJORITY OF PAID LOSSES ON SETTLED CLAIMS IN 2003 ($453 MILLION) AND 2002

($173 MILLION), AS WELL AS THE MAJORITY OF COSTS TO ADMINISTER IN 2002 ($12

MILLION), WITH THE REMAINDER RELATING TO CLAIMS MADE IN PRIOR YEARS. APPROXIMATELY

32% AND 25% OF THE PENDING GENERAL LIABILITY ASBESTOS CLAIM SUPPLEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, CAME FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO TENDERED THEIR FIRST

ASBESTOS CLAIM WITHIN THREE YEARS OF THOSE RESPECTIVE DATES. THE INCREASE IN

NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS ARISE FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO TENDERED THEIR FIRST CLAIM

TO US WITHIN THE LAST THREE YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, APPROXIMATELY 73% OF THE

GENERAL LIABILITY CLAIM SUPPLEMENTS REPORTED DURING 2003 CAME FROM

POLICYHOLDERS WHO TENDERED THEIR FIRST CLAIM AFTER JANUARY 1, 2001. THESE

CLAIMS ARE GENERALLY RELATIVELY SMALL AND HAVE, TO DATE, PRESENTED MINIMAL

EXPOSURE.

ASSUMED

REINSURANCE

THIS PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS REPRESENTS OUR

REPORTED REINSURANCE SEGMENT AND INCLUDES PROPERTY AND LIABILITY LOSS EXPOSURES

ASSUMED ON BOTH A PROPORTIONAL AND EXCESS OF LOSS BASIS. THERE ARE BOTH LOW

FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY EXPOSURES AS WELL AS SOME EVENT-DRIVEN HIGH-SEVERITY

EXPOSURES. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE HIGH EXPOSURE BUSINESS WAS CATASTROPHE

RELATED. AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2002, WE WERE NO LONGER SIGNIFICANTLY EXPOSED

TO SUBSEQUENT EVENTS DUE TO THE TRANSFER OF OUR ONGOING REINSURANCE OPERATIONS

TO PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD. ALTHOUGH OUR PROPERTY EXPOSURE

(INCLUDED IN THIS DATA) IS NOT CONSIDERED LONG TAIL, OUR CASUALTY EXPOSURE IS

CONSIDERED LONG TAIL ANDSIMILAR TO OUR PRIMARY GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURESIS

SENSITIVE TO THE RISK OF UNEXPECTED INCREASES IN INFLATION. THE LARGER LOSS

SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS FROM 2001 THROUGH 2003 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO LOSSES

RESULTING FROM THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACK.

PRIOR-YEAR LOSS

DEVELOPMENT

NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES A RECONCILIATION OF OUR BEGINNING AND ENDING LOSS

AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR EACH OF THE YEARS 2003, 2002 AND 2001.

THAT RECONCILIATION SHOWS THAT WE RECORDED AN INCREASE IN THE LOSS PROVISION

FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR CLAIMS INCURRED IN PRIOR YEARS TOTALING $646

MILLION IN 2003, $1.0 BILLION IN 2002 AND $577 MILLION IN 2001.

OUR RUNOFF HEALTH CARE OPERATION

ACCOUNTED FOR $350 MILLION OF THE TOTAL 2003 PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION, AND OUR OTHER

RUNOFF OPERATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR $285 MILLION OF THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISION. WE

RECORDED $25 MILLION OF FAVORABLE PRIOR-YEAR LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN OUR RUNOFF

REINSURANCE OPERATIONS. OF THE 2002 TOTAL, $472 MILLION RESULTED FROM THE

SETTLEMENT OF THE WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE

DETAIL EARLIER IN THIS DISCUSSION. THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAINING 2002 PRIOR

YEAR DEVELOPMENT WAS CONCENTRATED IN OUR HEALTH CARE, SURETY, CONSTRUCTION, AND

OTHER OPERATIONS. THE INCREASE IN PRIOR-YEAR

91

LOSS

PROVISIONS IN 2001 WAS DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL LOSSES IN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION.

THAT DEVELOPMENT IN ALL THREE YEARS IS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN THE RESPECTIVE

SEGMENT SECTIONS INCLUDED HEREIN.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND

ASBESTOS CLAIMS

WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS, INCLUDING THROUGH

LAWSUITS, ALLEGING INJURY OR DAMAGE FROM ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION OR SEEKING

PAYMENT FOR THE COST TO CLEAN UP POLLUTED SITES. WE ALSO RECEIVE ASBESTOS

INJURY CLAIMS, INCLUDING THROUGH LAWSUITS, ARISING OUT OF COVERAGES UNDER

GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES. MOST OF THESE CLAIMS ARISE FROM POLICIES WRITTEN

MANY YEARS AGO. SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ISSUES, PRIMARILY PERTAINING TO THE SCOPE OF

COVERAGE, COMPLICATE THE DETERMINATION OF OUR ALLEGED LIABILITY FOR BOTH

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS. IN OUR OPINION, COURT DECISIONS IN CERTAIN

JURISDICTIONS HAVE TENDED TO BROADEN INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL

AND ASBESTOS MATTERS BEYOND THE INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL INSURANCE POLICIES.

OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IS

DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE BECAUSE OF THESE LEGAL ISSUES. INSURED PARTIES HAVE

SUBMITTED CLAIMS FOR LOSSES THAT IN OUR VIEW ARE NOT COVERED IN THEIR

RESPECTIVE INSURANCE POLICIES, AND THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS MAY BE

SUBJECT TO LENGTHY LITIGATION, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR POTENTIAL

LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, VARIABLES SUCH AS THE LENGTH OF TIME NECESSARY TO CLEAN

UP A POLLUTED SITE, AND CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING THE IDENTITY OF THE

RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND THE DEGREE OF REMEDIATION DEEMED NECESSARY, MAKE IT DIFFICULT

TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COST OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM.

ESTIMATING OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS

IS ALSO VERY DIFFICULT. THE PRIMARY FACTORS INFLUENCING OUR ESTIMATE OF THE

TOTAL COST OF THESE CLAIMS ARE CASE LAW AND A HISTORY OF PRIOR CLAIM

92

DEVELOPMENT, BOTH OF WHICH

CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND ARE COMPLICATED BY AGGRESSIVE LITIGATION AGAINST

INSURERS, INCLUDING US. ESTIMATING ULTIMATE LIABILITY IS ALSO COMPLICATED BY

THE DIFFICULTY OF ASSESSING WHAT RIGHTS, IF ANY, WE MAY HAVE TO SEEK CONTRIBUTION

FROM OTHER INSURERS OF ANY POLICYHOLDER.

LATE IN 2001, WE HIRED A NEW EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

OF CLAIMS, WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS

HANDLING AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS RESERVES, WHO CONDUCTED A SUMMARY LEVEL

REVIEW OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS RESERVES. AS A RESULT OF OBSERVATIONS

MADE IN THIS REVIEW, WE UNDERTOOK MORE DETAILED ACTUARIAL AND CLAIMS ANALYSES

OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES. NO ADJUSTMENT TO RESERVES WAS MADE IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2001, SINCE MANAGEMENT DID NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT BASIS FOR MAKING AN

ADJUSTMENT UNTIL SUCH SUPPLEMENTAL ANALYSES WERE COMPLETED, AND WE BELIEVED OUR

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS RESERVES WERE ADEQUATE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001.

OUR HISTORICAL METHODOLOGY (THROUGH FIRST QUARTER

2002) FOR REVIEWING THE ADEQUACY OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS RESERVES

UTILIZED A SURVIVAL RATIO METRIC, WHICH CONSIDERS ENDING RESERVES IN RELATION

TO CALENDAR YEAR PAID LOSSES. WHEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE ANALYSES WERE

COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, WE SUPPLEMENTED OUR SURVIVAL RATIO

DIAGNOSTICS WITH THE DETAILED ADDITIONAL ANALYSES REFERRED TO ABOVE, AND

CONCLUDED THAT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES WERE REDUNDANT BY APPROXIMATELY $150

MILLION. BASED ON OUR ADDITIONAL ANALYSES, WE RELEASED APPROXIMATELY $150

MILLION OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002. HAD WE

CONTINUED TO RELY SOLELY ON OUR ANALYSIS OF SURVIVAL RATIO, WE WOULD HAVE

RECORDED NO ADJUSTMENT TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES THROUGH THE SIX MONTHS

ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, WE ALSO SUPPLEMENTED

OUR SURVIVAL RATIO ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS RESERVES WITH A DETAILED CLAIMS

ANALYSIS. WE DETERMINED THAT, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE WESTERN MACARTHUR

SETTLEMENT, OUR ASBESTOS RESERVES WERE ADEQUATE; HOWEVER, INCLUDING THAT

IMPACT, WE DETERMINED THAT OUR ASBESTOS RESERVES WERE INADEQUATE.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE UPDATED OUR DETAILED

ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS FOR BOTH ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES PERTAINING TO

OUR EXPOSURE FROM DIRECT POLICYHOLDERS AND RELIED MORE HEAVILY ON THESE

ANALYSES IN DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVE PROVISION FOR THE REMAINING

UNREPORTED LOSSES. FOR NON-WORKERS COMPENSATION ASBESTOS CLAIMS WE

SUPPLEMENTED THIS DETAILED ANALYSIS WITH AN ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE AN

ESTIMATE OF RESERVES SPECIFICALLY FOR POLICYHOLDERS WHO HAVE NOT AS YET

TENDERED THEIR FIRST ASBESTOS CLAIM. AS A RESULT OF THESE STUDIES WE INCREASED

NET ASBESTOS RESERVES BY $77 MILLION ($44 MILLION IN OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AND

$33 MILLION IN OUR RUNOFF OPERATIONS) AND NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $14

MILLION (ALL IN OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS). IN ADDITION, REVIEWS OF ASSUMED AND

NON-DOMESTIC EXPOSURES CAUSED US TO INCREASE NET ASBESTOS RESERVES BY $13

MILLION AND REDUCE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $1 MILLION (ALL OF WHICH WAS

RECORDED IN OUR RUNOFF OPERATIONS).

AS A RESULT OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ASBESTOS LITIGATION

ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY, WE DETERMINED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002 THAT IT WOULD

BE DESIRABLE TO SEEK EARLIER AND ULTIMATELY LESS COSTLY RESOLUTIONS OF CERTAIN

PENDING ASBESTOS-RELATED LITIGATIONS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE DECIDED WHERE

POSSIBLE TO SEEK TO RESOLVE THESE MATTERS WHILE CONTINUING TO VIGOROUSLY ASSERT

DEFENSES IN PENDING LITIGATIONS. WE ARE TAKING A SIMILAR APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL

LITIGATIONS. AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL EARLIER IN THIS REPORT, IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2002 WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SETTLE ASBESTOS

CLAIMS FOR A TOTAL GROSS COST OF $995 MILLION ARISING FROM ANY INSURING

RELATIONSHIP WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY HAVE HAD WITH MACARTHUR

COMPANY, WESTERN MACARTHUR COMPANY OR WESTERN ASBESTOS COMPANY.

THE TABLE BELOW REPRESENTS A RECONCILIATION OF TOTAL

GROSS AND NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003. AMOUNTS IN THE NET COLUMN ARE

REDUCED BY REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE DISCLOSURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES. ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO SEPARATELY IDENTIFY LOSS PAYMENTS AND RESERVE

AMOUNTS RELATED TO POLICIES THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY UNDERWRITTEN TO COVER

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, REFERRED TO AS UNDERWRITTEN, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS

RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES THAT WERE NOT SPECIFICALLY UNDERWRITTEN,

REFERRED TO AS NOT UNDERWRITTEN.  IN

1988, WE

93

COMPLETED OUR

IMPLEMENTATION OF A POLLUTION EXCLUSION IN OUR COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY

POLICIES; THEREFORE, ACTIVITY RELATED TO ACCIDENT YEARS AFTER 1988 GENERALLY

RELATES TO POLICIES UNDERWRITTEN TO INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES.

THE AMOUNTS PRESENTED FOR PAID LOSSES IN THE FOLLOWING

TABLE AS UNDERWRITTEN INCLUDE PRIMARILY EXPOSURES RELATED TO ACCIDENT YEARS

AFTER 1988 FOR POLICIES WHICH THE UNDERWRITER CONTEMPLATED PROVIDING

ENVIRONMENTAL COVERAGE. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN PRE-1988 EXPOSURES, PRIMARILY

FIRST PARTY LOSSES, ARE INCLUDED SINCE, THEY TOO, WERE CONTEMPLATED BY THE

UNDERWRITER TO INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL COVERAGE. NOT UNDERWRITTEN PRIMARILY

REPRESENTS EXPOSURES RELATED TO ACCIDENT YEARS 1988 AND PRIOR FOR POLICIES

WHICH WERE NOT CONTEMPLATED BY THE UNDERWRITER TO INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL

THE $150

MILLION REDUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY WAS INCLUDED

IN BOTH THE GROSS AND NET INCURRED LOSSES FOR 2002.

FOR THE YEAR 2001, THE GROSS AND NET ENVIRONMENTAL UNDERWRITTEN

RESERVES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TOTALED $27 MILLION AND $26 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR BOTH TOTALED $28 MILLION. FOR 2002,

THE YEAR-END GROSS AND NET ENVIRONMENTAL UNDERWRITTEN RESERVES WERE BOTH $36

MILLION, AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 THE GROSS RESERVES WERE $37 MILLION AND

NET RESERVES WERE $36 MILLION. THESE RESERVES RELATE TO POLICIES THAT WERE

SPECIFICALLY UNDERWRITTEN TO INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES. THESE UNDERWRITTEN

RESERVE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL RESERVE AMOUNTS IN THE PRECEDING

TABLE.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS A RECONCILIATION OF TOTAL GROSS AND NET RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD

GROSS PAID LOSSES IN 2003 INCLUDE THE $747 MILLION

PURSUANT TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. WESTERN

MACARTHUR ACCOUNTED FOR $9 MILLION OF GROSS INCURRED LOSSES IN 2003. INCLUDED

IN GROSS INCURRED LOSSES IN 2002 (INCLUDING THE $150 MILLION RESERVE INCREASE)

WERE $995 MILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR AGREEMENT. ALSO

INCLUDED IN THE GROSS AND NET INCURRED LOSSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2002, BUT

94

REPORTED SEPARATELY IN THE

ABOVE TABLE, WAS A $150 MILLION INCREASE IN ASBESTOS RESERVES. GROSS PAID

LOSSES INCLUDE THE $248 MILLION WESTERN MACARTHUR PAYMENT MADE IN JUNE 2002.

OUR RESERVES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS LOSSES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 REPRESENT OUR BEST

ESTIMATE OF OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH LOSSES, BASED ON ALL INFORMATION

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN ESTIMATING SUCH

LOSSES, HOWEVER, WE CANNOT GIVE ASSURANCES THAT OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS LOSSES WILL, IN FACT, MATCH CURRENT RESERVES. WE

CONTINUE TO EVALUATE NEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOPING LOSS PATTERNS, AS WELL AS

THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF OUR DETERMINATION TO SEEK EARLIER AND ULTIMATELY LESS

COSTLY RESOLUTIONS OF CERTAIN PENDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED

LITIGATIONS. FUTURE CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OF OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR OVERALL

FINANCIAL POSITION.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS, EXCHANGE-TRADED

FUNDS AND MUTUAL FUNDS; (2) UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION REVENUES EARNED

UPON THE SALE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND (3) PERFORMANCE FEES

EARNED ON CERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH

ACQUISITIONS



IN

AUGUST 2002, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED NWQ INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY, INC.

(NWQ), AN ASSET MANAGEMENT FIRM BASED IN LOS ANGELES WITH APPROXIMATELY $6.9

BILLION OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN BOTH RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL MANAGED

ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITION. NWQ SPECIALIZES IN VALUE-ORIENTED

EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND HAS SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG INSTITUTIONS AND

FINANCIAL ADVISORS. THE NWQ PURCHASE PRICE INCLUDED UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $20

MILLION PAYABLE TO THE SELLER OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD UNDER TERMS OF A

STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT, OF WHICH $2.5 MILLION WAS PAID IN 2003. THE

PURCHASE PRICE WAS FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF AVAILABLE CASH AND

BORROWINGS UNDER AN INTERCOMPANY CREDIT FACILITY BETWEEN THE ST. PAUL AND

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS.

IN JULY 2001,

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED SYMPHONY ASSET MANAGEMENT LLC (SYMPHONY), AN

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGER BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH APPROXIMATELY $4

BILLION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITION. THE

ACQUISITION OF SYMPHONY EXPANDED NUVEEN INVESTMENTS PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO

INCLUDE MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND FUNDS DESIGNED TO REDUCE RISK THROUGH

MARKET-NEUTRAL AND OTHER STRATEGIES FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS.

2003

VS.

2002GROSS INVESTMENT PRODUCT SALES IN

2003 TOTALED A RECORD $18.1 BILLION, 16% HIGHER THAN 2002 PRODUCT SALES OF

$15.6 BILLION. NET FLOWS (EQUAL TO THE SUM OF SALES, REINVESTMENTS AND

EXCHANGES, LESS REDEMPTIONS) WERE $9.4 BILLION IN 2003, OVER $2 BILLION HIGHER

THAN 2002 NET FLOWS OF $7.3 BILLION. NET FLOWS WERE POSITIVE ACROSS ALL PRODUCT

LINESMANAGED ACCOUNTS, CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED PRODUCTS AND MUTUAL FUNDS. INVESTOR

DEMAND IN 2003 CONTINUED TO BE STRONG FOR MUNICIPAL INVESTMENTS AND

HIGH-QUALITY TAXABLE INCOME-ORIENTED INVESTMENTS. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS RAISED

$5.7 BILLION DURING THE YEAR THROUGH NEW CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS THAT

BLEND VARIOUS STOCK AND BOND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. WITH THE REBOUND OF EQUITY

MARKETS AND INVESTORS RENEWED INTEREST IN EQUITY INVESTING, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

EQUITY SALES GREW 45% OVER 2002 TO $6.4 BILLION. THE SUCCESS NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

HAS ACHIEVED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN BROADENING ITS BUSINESS BEYOND

MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ENABLED NUVEEN INVESTMENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE RECOVERY

OF EQUITY MARKETS THROUGH BOTH POSITIVE NET FLOWS AND MARKET APPRECIATION.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT THE END OF 2003 TOTALED

$95.4 BILLION, 20% HIGHER THAN THE YEAR-END 2002 TOTAL OF $79.7 BILLION. THE

INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE STRONG NET FLOWS DURING THE YEAR, AS WELL AS $6.2

BILLION OF EQUITY AND BOND MARKET APPRECIATION. MANAGED ASSETS AT THE END OF

THE YEAR WERE COMPRISED OF $47.1 BILLION OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, $25.7

BILLION OF RETAIL MANAGED ACCOUNTS, $10.3 BILLION OF INSTITUTIONAL MANAGED

ACCOUNTS, AND $12.3 BILLION OF MUTUAL FUNDS.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY

REVENUE TOTALED $405 MILLION IN 2003, 14% HIGHER THAN 2002 REVENUE OF $355

MILLION. THE INCREASE IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS THE NWQ ACQUISITION

IN AUGUST 2002 ACCOUNTED FOR A PORTION OF THE HIGHER REVENUES IN 2003. PERFORMANCE

FEE REVENUES OF $34 MILLION GREW 48% OVER COMPARABLE 2002 FEES OF $23 MILLION,

DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG FIXED INCOME PERFORMANCE AT SYMPHONY. THE 15% INCREASE

IN OPERATING EXPENSES IN 2003 COMPARED WITH 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

INCLUSION OF NWQ IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS RESULTS FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.

2002

VS.

2001



GROSS

SALES OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS OF $15.6 BILLION IN 2002 GREW 10% OVER SALES OF

$14.2 BILLION IN 2001. THE INCREASE OVER 2001 WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN

EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND SALES. MUNICIPAL MUTUAL FUND SALES AND INSTITUTIONAL

MANAGED ACCOUNT SALES ALSO INCREASED OVER 2001. SALES OF RETAIL MANAGED

ACCOUNTS DECLINED, AS THE ADDITION OF NWQ VALUE ACCOUNTS WAS MORE THAN OFFSET

BY A REDUCTION IN EQUITY GROWTH ACCOUNT SALES. DEFINED PORTFOLIO SALES ALSO

DECLINED IN 2002, DUE TO NUVEEN INVESTMENTS DECISION TO EXIT THIS PRODUCT LINE

IN 2002. NET FLOWS OF $7.3 BILLION IN 2002 WERE DOWN 5% FROM COMPARABLE 2001

NET FLOWS OF $7.7 BILLION. NET FLOWS WERE POSITIVE ACROSS ALL PRODUCT

CATEGORIES IN 2002



MANAGED

ACCOUNTS, EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS AND MUTUAL FUNDS. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS INTRODUCED

18 MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS IN 2002, WHICH, COMBINED WITH

MUNICIPAL MUTUAL FUNDS AND MANAGED ACCOUNTS, RAISED $4.8 BILLION IN NET NEW

ASSETS FOR THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS LAUNCHED THE FIRST

PREFERRED STOCK CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND IN THE INDUSTRY, GENERATING

APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION IN NEW ASSETS.

96

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT

THE END OF 2002 OF $79.7 BILLION, WERE 16% HIGHER THAN THE YEAR-END 2001 TOTAL

OF $68.5 BILLION. THE NWQ ACQUISITION ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY $7 BILLION OF

THE INCREASE, WITH THE REMAINDER DUE TO STRONG NET FLOWS THAT MORE THAN OFFSET

EQUITY MARKET DECLINES. MANAGED ASSETS AT THE END OF THE YEAR WERE COMPRISED OF

$39.9 BILLION OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, $19.4 BILLION OF RETAIL MANAGED

ACCOUNTS, $8.5 BILLION OF INSTITUTIONAL MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND $11.9 BILLION OF

MUTUAL FUNDS.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY

REVENUE OF $355 MILLION IN 2002 GREW 8% OVER 2001 REVENUES OF $331 MILLION. A

FULL YEAR OF SYMPHONY AND THE ADDITION OF NWQ ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6% OF

THE INCREASE, WHILE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS AND OTHER FIXED-INCOME PRODUCTS DROVE

THE REMAINDER. REVENUES ON EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS GREW 10% DUE TO AN INCREASE IN

AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF BOTH POSITIVE NET FLOWS AND

MARKET APPRECIATION. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN

ADVISORY REVENUE RELATED TO EQUITY GROWTH ACCOUNTS, WHERE ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT DECLINED DUE TO MARKET DEPRECIATION AND WITHDRAWALS.

SHARE REPURCHASES



NUVEEN INVESTMENTS REPURCHASED COMMON

SHARES FROM MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001 FOR TOTAL COSTS OF $42

MILLION, $151 MILLION AND $172 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NO SHARES WERE

REPURCHASED FROM THE ST. PAUL IN THOSE YEARS. OUR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP IN NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS GREW FROM 78% AT THE END OF

2000 TO 79% AT THE END OF 2003, AS THE SHARE REPURCHASES WERE

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER

VARIOUS STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS AND THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON SHARES UPON

THE CONVERSION OF A PORTION OF ITS PREFERRED STOCK. AS PART OF A NEW SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED IN AUGUST 2002, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS HAD

AUTHORITY FROM ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO PURCHASE UP TO 7.0 MILLION SHARES OF

ITS COMMON STOCK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THERE WERE 4.2 MILLION SHARES

REMAINING UNDER THE NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

PREFERRED SECURITIES TO INVESTORS. SEE FURTHER INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING RULES, PRIOR YEARS WERE NOT RESTATED

TO CONFORM TO THE 2003 PRESENTATION.

COMMON EQUITY



IN 2003, THE 8% INCREASE IN COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY WAS DRIVEN BY OUR NET INCOME OF $661 MILLION FOR THE YEAR.

IN 2002, OUR ISSUANCE OF NEW COMMON SHARES THROUGH A PUBLIC OFFERING AND OUR

NET INCOME OF $218 MILLION WERE THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE 12%

INCREASE IN COMMON EQUITY OVER YEAR-END 2001. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARIZES THE

MAJOR FACTORS IMPACTING OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN EACH OF THE LAST

THREE YEARS.

·

COMMON DIVIDENDS

.   WE DECLARED COMMON DIVIDENDS

TOTALING $264 MILLION IN 2003, $252 MILLION IN 2002 AND $235 MILLION IN 2001. IN

FEBRUARY 2004, THE ST. PAULS BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY

DIVIDEND OF $0.29 PER SHARE PAYABLE APRIL 16, 2004, LEVEL WITH THE 2003

QUARTERLY RATE.

·

COMMON SHARE ISSUANCE.

IN JULY 2002,

WE ISSUED 17.8 MILLION COMMON SHARES AT $24.20 PER SHARE IN A PUBLIC OFFERING

THAT GENERATED NET PROCEEDS OF $413 MILLION. THE MAJORITY OF PROCEEDS WERE

CONTRIBUTED AS CAPITAL TO OUR INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES.

·

COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES

.   IN 2003 AND 2002, WE MADE NO

SIGNIFICANT REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON SHARES. IN 2001, WE REPURCHASED AND

RETIRED 13.0 MILLION OF OUR COMMON SHARES FOR A TOTAL COST OF $589 MILLION, OR

APPROXIMATELY $45 PER SHARE. THE SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2001 OCCURRED PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 11

AND REPRESENTED 6% OF OUR TOTAL SHARES OUTSTANDING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

THE SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2001 WERE FINANCED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF INTERNALLY

GENERATED FUNDS AND NEW DEBT ISSUANCES.

·

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS

.   THE

NET AFTER-TAX APPRECIATION ON OUR FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DECLINED BY

$114 MILLION FROM YEAR-END 2002, REFLECTING A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF

THAT PORTFOLIO DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES IN 2003. IN 2002,

THE NET AFTER-TAX APPRECIATION ON OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO GREW BY $300

MILLION OVER YEAR-END 2001, REFLECTING THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN INTEREST

RATES DURING THE YEAR.

PREFERRED EQUITYPREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

CONSISTED OF THE PAR VALUE OF THE SERIES B PREFERRED SHARES WE ISSUED TO

OUR STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP) TRUST, LESS THE REMAINING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF

THE SOP TRUST DEBT. DURING 2003, 2002 AND 2001, THE TRUST MADE PRINCIPAL

PAYMENTS OF $18 MILLION, $13 MILLION AND $14 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE

TRUST DEBT.

AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE

12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 WE

CONCLUDED THAT THE PROVISIONS OF FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46 CONSOLIDATION

OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES(AS REVISED) (FIN 46(R)) APPLIED TO THE FIVE

BUSINESS TRUSTS THAT ISSUED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES TO

INVESTORS WHICH WERE FULLY GUARANTEED BY US. AS A RESULT, WE DE-CONSOLIDATED

THESE TRUSTS, AND NOW REPORT OUR BORROWINGS FROM THESE TRUSTS AS DEBT ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2003, THE PREFERRED SECURITIES

ISSUED BY THESE TRUSTS AND GUARANTEED BY US WERE REPORTED IN OUR BALANCE SHEET

AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM BETWEEN TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND

REFERRED TO AS COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SECURITIES OF TRUSTS

HOLDING SOLELY SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES OF THE COMPANY.  PRIOR TO 2003, THE DEBT ISSUED BY US TO THE

TRUSTS WAS ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE

PROVISIONS OF THE FIVE BUSINESS TRUSTS, EACH OF WHICH WAS FORMED FOR THE SOLE

PURPOSE OF ISSUING THOSE SECURITIES.

·

ST.

PAUL CAPITAL TRUST I ISSUED 23,000,000 PREFERRED SECURITIES GENERATING GROSS

PROCEEDS OF $575 MILLION, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE USED TO PURCHASE

SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY US. WE MAKE QUARTERLY INTEREST PAYMENTS AT A

RATE OF 7.6% ON THE DEBENTURES, WHICH HAVE A MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE OF OCTOBER 15,

2050. THE PREFERRED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST IN TURN PAY A QUARTERLY

DISTRIBUTION AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 7.6%. WE CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES ON OR

AFTER NOVEMBER 13, 2006. THE PROCEEDS OF SUCH REDEMPTION WOULD BE USED BY

THE TRUST TO REDEEM A LIKE AMOUNT OF ITS PREFERRED SECURITIES.

99

·

MMI

CAPITAL TRUST I ISSUED $125 MILLION OF PREFERRED SECURITIES IN 1997, THE

PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE USED TO PURCHASE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY MMI

CORPORATION. WE ASSUMED THE LIABILITY FOR THESE DEBENTURES UPON OUR ACQUISITION

OF MMI IN 2000. WE MAKE SEMI-ANNUAL INTEREST PAYMENTS AT A RATE OF 7.625% ON

THE DEBENTURES, WHICH HAVE A MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE OF DECEMBER 15,

2027. THE PREFERRED SECURITIES IN TURN PAY A PREFERRED DISTRIBUTION OF 7.625%

SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS. IN 2002, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED $4 MILLION OF THE

MMI TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES IN AN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTION.

·

USF&G

CAPITAL TRUSTS I, II AND III EACH ISSUED $100 MILLION OF PREFERRED

SECURITIES IN 1997 AND 1996, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE USED TO PURCHASE

SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY USF&G CORPORATION, WHICH MADE SEMI-ANNUAL

INTEREST PAYMENTS AT RATES OF 8.5%, 8.47% AND 8.312%, RESPECTIVELY. WE ASSUMED

THE LIABILITY FOR THESE DEBENTURES UPON OUR MERGER WITH USF&G CORPORATION

IN 1998. SINCE THE MERGER, WE HAVE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED SECURITIES FROM EACH

TRUST FROM TIME TO TIME IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS. THE DEBENTURES RELATED TO

THE USF&G CAPITAL TRUST I, II AND III HAVE MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATES

OF DECEMBER 15, 2045, JANUARY 10, 2027 AND JULY 1, 2046,

RESPECTIVELY. DEBENTURES RELATED TO EACH TRUST MAY, HOWEVER, BE REDEEMED

EARLIER UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT VARY AMONG THE THREE TRUSTS. THE PROCEEDS

OF SUCH REDEMPTIONS WOULD BE USED TO REDEEM A LIKE AMOUNT OF EACH TRUSTS PREFERRED

SECURITIES.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

ISSUED $300 MILLION OF 4.22% NOTES DUE IN SEPTEMBER 2008 IN A PRIVATE

PLACEMENT.  A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS WAS

USED TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT AND REPAY A $105 MILLION LOAN FROM THE ST. PAUL.

THE REMAINDER WILL BE USED FOR NUVEEN INVESTMENTS GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. DURING

2003, $67 MILLION OF THE ST. PAULS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MATURED, WHICH WERE

FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF INTERNALLY-GENERATED FUNDS AND THE ISSUANCE OF

COMMERCIAL PAPER.

2002

VS. 2001



THE $541 MILLION NET INCREASE IN

REPORTED DEBT OBLIGATIONS IN 2002 OVER 2001 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW DEBT

ISSUANCES TO FUND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND LOANS TO OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES.

IN MARCH 2002, WE ISSUED $500 MILLION OF 5.75% SENIOR NOTES THAT MATURE IN

2007, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE PRIMARILY USED TO REPAY A LIKE AMOUNT OF OUR

COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AT THE TIME. IN JULY 2002, WE SOLD 17.8

MILLION OF OUR COMMON SHARES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING FOR GROSS CONSIDERATION OF

$431 MILLION, OR $24.20 PER SHARE. IN A SEPARATE CONCURRENT PUBLIC OFFERING, WE

SOLD 8.9 MILLION EQUITY UNITS, EACH HAVING A STATED AMOUNT OF $50, FOR GROSS

CONSIDERATION OF $443 MILLION. EACH EQUITY UNIT INITIALLY CONSISTS OF A

THREE-YEAR FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACT FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR UNSECURED $50

SENIOR NOTE DUE IN AUGUST 2007. TOTAL ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE EQUITY

UNITS ARE AT THE RATE OF 9.00%, CONSISTING OF INTEREST ON THE NOTE AT A RATE OF

5.25% AND FEE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FORWARD CONTRACT OF 3.75%. THE FORWARD

CONTRACT REQUIRES THE INVESTOR TO PURCHASE, FOR $50, A VARIABLE NUMBER OF

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF AUGUST 16, 2005. THE

$46 MILLION PRESENT VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACT FEE PAYMENTS WAS RECORDED AS

A REDUCTION TO OUR REPORTED COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE NUMBER OF SHARES

TO BE PURCHASED WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON A FORMULA THAT CONSIDERS THE

AVERAGE TRADING PRICE OF THE STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT

IN RELATION TO THE $24.20 PER SHARE PRICE AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING. HAD THE

SETTLEMENT DATE BEEN DECEMBER 31, 2003 OR 2002, WE WOULD HAVE ISSUED

APPROXIMATELY 15 MILLION COMMON SHARES BASED ON THE AVERAGE TRADING PRICE OF

OUR COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THAT DATE. THE COMBINED NET PROCEEDS OF

THESE OFFERINGS, AFTER UNDERWRITING COMMISSIONS AND OTHER FEES AND EXPENSES,

WERE APPROXIMATELY $842 MILLION, OF WHICH $750 MILLION WAS CONTRIBUTED AS

CAPITAL TO OUR INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES.

THROUGHOUT 2002, MEDIUM-TERM NOTES TOTALING $49

MILLION MATURED, AND THEIR REPAYMENT WAS FUNDED THROUGH INTERNALLY GENERATED

FUNDS. IN JULY 2002, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ENTERED INTO AND FULLY DREW DOWN A

$250 MILLION REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WITH THE ST. PAUL. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

USED A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DEBT OUTSTANDING ON ITS

REVOLVING BANK LINE OF CREDIT FROM $183 MILLION AT THE END OF JUNE 2002 TO

$55 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

100

INTEREST EXPENSENET INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEBT TOTALED

$187 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $112 MILLION IN 2002. THE 2003 TOTAL

INCLUDED $72 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DEBT ASSOCIATED WITH

THE FIVE BUSINESS TRUSTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AT THE END OF 2003 AND 2002, WE WERE

PARTY TO A NUMBER OF INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS RELATED TO SEVERAL OF OUR

DEBT SECURITIES OUTSTANDING. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE SWAPS TOTALED $730

MILLION AT BOTH DATES, AND THEIR AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE WAS $46 MILLION AND $65

MILLION AT YEAR-END 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP

AGREEMENTS IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET, WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE TO REPORTED

DEBT. THESE SWAP AGREEMENTS HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING OUR INTEREST EXPENSE BY

$32 MILLION AND $21 MILLION IN 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES



AS NOTED ABOVE, THESE SECURITIES WERE

ISSUED BY FIVE BUSINESS TRUSTS THAT WERE FULLY GUARANTEED BY THE ST. PAUL. PRIOR

TO THE ADOPTION OF THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R) WITH RESPECT TO THESE TRUSTS IN

2003, THE TRUSTS WERE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE

SECURITIES THEY ISSUED WERE INCLUDED IN OUR BALANCE SHEET AS A SEPARATE LINE

BETWEEN LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WE DID NOT RESTATE PRIOR YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

UPON OUR ADOPTION OF FIN 46(R).

OUR TOTAL DISTRIBUTION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE

PREFERRED SECURITIES WAS $70 MILLION IN 2002 AND $33 MILLION IN 2001. THE

INCREASE IN 2002 WAS DUE TO THE $575 MILLION, 7.6% SECURITIES ISSUED BY ST.

PAUL CAPITAL TRUST I IN NOVEMBER 2001. IN 2003, SUBSEQUENT TO THE

DE-CONSOLIDATION OF THESE TRUSTS, THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THESE TRUSTS ($72

MILLION) WAS INCLUDED IN OUR TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE.

MAJOR ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES



IN MARCH 2002, WE COMPLETED OUR

ACQUISITION OF LONDON GUARANTEE (NOW ST. PAUL GUARANTEE) FOR A TOTAL COST

OF APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION, FINANCED WITH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2001, WE SOLD OUR LIFE INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARY, F&G LIFE, TO OLD MUTUAL PLC, FOR $335 MILLION IN CASH AND 190.4

MILLION OLD MUTUAL ORDINARY SHARES (VALUED AT $300 MILLION AT CLOSING). THE

CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED WERE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN JUNE 2002,

WE SOLD ALL OF THE OLD MUTUAL SHARES WE WERE HOLDING FOR TOTAL NET PROCEEDS OF

$287 MILLION, WHICH WERE ALSO USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

CAPITAL COMMITMENTS



WE MADE NO MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

DURING ANY OF THE LAST THREE YEARS, AND NONE ARE ANTICIPATED IN 2004.

THE ST. PAUL

LIQUIDITY

LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT

CASH FLOWS TO MEET THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS

OPERATIONS. OUR UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS SHORT-TERM CASH NEEDS PRIMARILY

CONSIST OF PAYING INSURANCE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES AND DAY-TO-DAY

OPERATING EXPENSES. THOSE NEEDS ARE MET THROUGH CASH RECEIPTS FROM OPERATIONS,

WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF INSURANCE PREMIUMS COLLECTED AND INVESTMENT INCOME.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS ALSO A SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, THROUGH THE

SALE OF READILY MARKETABLE FIXED MATURITIES, EQUITY SECURITIES AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AND VENTURE

CAPITAL HOLDINGS. AFTER SATISFYING OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, EXCESS CASH FLOWS

FROM THESE UNDERWRITING AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES ARE USED TO BUILD THE

TOTALED $133 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH CASH PROVIDED BY CONTINUING

OPERATIONS OF $129 MILLION IN 2002 AND $884 MILLION IN 2001. OPERATIONAL CASH

FLOWS IN 2003 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE JANUARY 2003 PAYMENT OF $747

MILLION RELATED TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION SETTLEMENT, WHICH

ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE NET $1.2 BILLION DECLINE IN INSURANCE

RESERVES DISCLOSED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEAR

ENDED

101

DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE

ADDITIONAL DECLINE IN INSURANCE RESERVES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR OTHER OPERATIONS THAT WERE PLACED IN

RUNOFF AT THE END OF 2001, WHICH INCLUDED OUR HEALTH CARE AND REINSURANCE

OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OF OUR INTERNATIONAL UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS. WE

HAVE CEASED UNDERWRITING NEW BUSINESS IN THESE OPERATIONS, AND AS EXPECTED, THE

PAYMENTS OUT OF PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES HAVE EXCEEDED NEW LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE PROVISIONS, RESULTING IN A DECLINE IN OUR TOTAL

RESERVE BALANCE. OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IMPROVED DURING THE SECOND HALF

OF 2003, HOWEVER, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES AND CONTINUING

IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF OUR BOOK OF BUSINESS IN OUR ONGOING UNDERWRITING

SEGMENTS.

OUR OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN 2002 WERE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY THE $248 MILLION PAYMENT MADE IN JUNE RELATED TO THE WESTERN

MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION SETTLEMENT, NET PAYMENTS OF $289 MILLION

ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TRANSFER OF UNEARNED PREMIUM BALANCES AND OTHER

REINSURANCE-RELATED BALANCES TO PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD. IN

NOVEMBER, LOSS PAYMENTS TOTALING $242 MILLION RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11,

2001 TERRORIST ATTACK AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS TOTALING $158

MILLION IN DECEMBER. LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS FROM OUR OTHER

BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN RUNOFF, WHERE OUR WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME WAS SIGNIFICANTLY

LESS THAN IN 2001, ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING CASH

FLOWS.

WE BELIEVE OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH CONTINUES TO PROVIDE

US WITH THE FLEXIBILITY AND CAPACITY TO OBTAIN FUNDS EXTERNALLY THROUGH DEBT OR

EQUITY FINANCINGS ON BOTH A SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BASIS. WE CONTINUE TO

MAINTAIN AN $800 MILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM WITH $600 MILLION OF BACK-UP

LIQUIDITY, CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF BANK CREDIT AGREEMENTS. IN JANUARY 2003,

WE ESTABLISHED A PROGRAM PROVIDING FOR THE OFFERING OF UP TO $500 MILLION OF

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES. AS OF FEBRUARY 27, 2004, WE HAD NOT ISSUED ANY NOTES

UNDER THIS PROGRAM. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE PROPOSED MERGER WOULD TRIGGER A

TECHNICAL EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER CERTAIN OF OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS; HOWEVER, THE

LENDERS HAVE AGREED TO WAIVE THE TECHNICAL EVENT OF DEFAULT, CONTINGENT UPON

THE CONSUMMATION OF THE PROPOSED MERGER.

WE PRIMARILY DEPEND ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES

TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, SERVICE OUR DEBT, AND PAY EXPENSES. ST.

PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY (FIRE AND MARINE) IS OUR LEAD U.S.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY AND ITS DIVIDEND PAYING CAPACITY IS

LIMITED BY THE LAWS OF MINNESOTA, ITS STATE OF DOMICILE. FIRE AND MARINES

ABILITY TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS FROM ITS DIRECT AND INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES IS ALSO

SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS OF

DOMICILE. BUSINESS AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS MAY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF

DIVIDENDS ACTUALLY PAID. APPROXIMATELY $774 MILLION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US

FROM PAYMENT OF ORDINARY DIVIDENDS BY FIRE AND MARINE IN 2004. ANY DIVIDEND

PAYMENTS BEYOND THE $774 MILLION LIMITATION ARE SUBJECT TO PRIOR APPROVAL OF

THE MINNESOTA COMMISSIONER OF COMMERCE. IN 2003, WE RECEIVED DIVIDENDS IN THE

FORM OF CASH AND SECURITIES TOTALING $625 MILLION FROM OUR U.S. UNDERWRITING

SUBSIDIARIES. WE RECEIVED NO CASH DIVIDENDS FROM OUR U.S. PROPERTY-LIABILITY

UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES IN 2002. IN 2001, WE RECEIVED DIVIDENDS IN THE FORM

OF CASH AND SECURITIES OF $827 MILLION FROM FIRE AND MARINE.

WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY

CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED, MIGHT

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES OR OPERATIONS.

INDEPENDENT RATINGS

RATINGS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY AND

FINANCIAL STRENGTH ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN ESTABLISHING THE COMPETITIVE

POSITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND WILL ALSO IMPACT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY

OF CAPITAL TO AN INSURANCE COMPANY. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES,

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON THE BASIS OF A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED RATING

ORGANIZATIONS. RATINGS REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN MAINTAINING

CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN OUR ABILITY TO MARKET INSURANCE PRODUCTS. RATING

ORGANIZATIONS

102

REGULARLY ANALYZE THE

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CONDITION OF INSURERS. ANY RATINGS DOWNGRADES, OR THE

POTENTIAL FOR RATINGS DOWNGRADES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET

AND DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2003, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES, INC.

LOWERED CERTAIN OF OUR FINANCIAL RATINGS AND THOSE OF OUR INSURANCE UNDERWRITING

SUBSIDIARIES AND ESTABLISHED A STABLE OUTLOOK ON THE RATINGS GOING FORWARD. IN JUNE 2003, A.M.

BEST CO. ALSO LOWERED CERTAIN OF OUR FINANCIAL RATINGS WHILE AFFIRMING THOSE OF

OUR INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES AND MAINTAINING STABLE OUTLOOKS FOR BOTH

SETS OF RATINGS GOING FORWARD.

IN CONNECTION WITH

THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER IN NOVEMBER 2003, A.M. BEST,

MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICE (MOODYS), STANDARD & POORS RATINGS SERVICES

(S&P) AND FITCH RATINGS (FITCH) ANNOUNCED THE FOLLOWING RATING ACTIONS.

·

A.M.

BEST: PLACED OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND DEBT RATINGS UNDER REVIEW WITH POSITIVE

IMPLICATIONS.

·

MOODYS.

CONFIRMED THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND DEBT RATINGS; RAISED THE FINANCIAL

STRENGTH RATING OUTLOOK FROM STABLE TO POSITIVE; CONFIRMED THE STABLE OUTLOOK

FOR DEBT RATINGS.

·

S&P.

PLACED THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND DEBT RATINGS ON CREDITWATCH WITH POSITIVE

IMPLICATIONS AND INDICATED THAT THE RATINGS COULD BE AFFIRMED OR RAISED BY ONE

NOTCH.

·

FITCH.

PLACED THE DEBT RATINGS ON RATING WATCH POSITIVE AND INDICATED THAT THE LONG

TERM DEBT RATING COULD BE UPGRADED BY ONE OR TWO NOTCHES.

SUBSEQUENT TO THESE

INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS, A.M. BEST, S&P AND FITCH ANNOUNCED THE

FOLLOWING.

·

A.M.

BEST: REVISED THE IMPLICATIONS OF ITS REVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND DEBT

RATINGS FROM POSITIVE TO DEVELOPING, FOLLOWING OUR ANNOUNCEMENT OF A

$350 MILLION PRETAX CHARGE IN THE 2003 FOURTH QUARTER TO INCREASE RESERVES

FOR OUR HEALTH CARE BUSINESS, WHICH IS IN RUNOFF.

·

S&P.

REVISED THE CREDITWATCH STATUS OF OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND DEBT RATINGS FROM

POSITIVE TO DEVELOPING, FOLLOWING OUR ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE $350 MILLION

PRETAX CHARGE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY REVISED THE CREDITWATCH STATUS FROM DEVELOPING

TO NEGATIVE, FOLLOWING ITS LATEST ASSESSMENT OF US ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. IT

INDICATED THAT, SUBJECT TO THE COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED MERGER, IT EXPECTS TO

AFFIRM OUR CURRENT A+ FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATING AND BBB+ SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT

RATING, WHICH WOULD ALIGN THE RATINGS WITH THOSE OF TRAVELERS POST-CLOSE OF THE

PROPOSED MERGER. IT ALSO INDICATED THAT IF THE PROPOSED MERGER WERE NOT

COMPLETED, IT WOULD EXPECT TO DOWNGRADE US TO AN A FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATING

AND A BBB SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING.

·

FITCH.

REVISED THE RATING WATCH STATUS OF OUR DEBT RATINGS FROM POSITIVE TO EVOLVING,

FOLLOWING OUR ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE $350 MILLION PRETAX CHARGE, AND

SUBSEQUENTLY LOWERED OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING FROM BBB+ TO BBB,

FOLLOWING ITS LATEST ASSESSMENT OF US ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. FITCH SIMULTANEOUSLY

REVISED THE RATING WATCH STATUS FROM EVOLVING TO POSITIVE AND INDICATED ITS

BELIEF THAT IT WILL LIKELY UPGRADE OUR RATINGS UPON THE CLOSE OF THE PROPOSED

MERGER WITH TRAVELERS.

RATINGS ARE NOT IN ANY WAY A MEASURE OF PROTECTION

AFFORDED TO INVESTORS AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT

DECISION.

PENSION PLANS

DUE TO THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR

PENSION PLANS, THE ACCOUNTING FOR SUCH PLANS IS COMPLEX AND REFLECTS VARIOUS

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. MANAGEMENTS SELECTION OF PLAN ASSUMPTIONS, PRIMARILY

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO CALCULATE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS (LTROR), CAN HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTING ESTIMATED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND

PENSION COST, AND THUS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SUCH PLAN

ASSUMPTIONS ARE DETERMINED ANNUALLY, SUBJECT TO REVISION IF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS

OCCUR DURING THE YEAR, SUCH AS PLAN MERGERS AND SIGNIFICANT PLAN AMENDMENTS.

OUR PENSION PLAN MEASUREMENT DATE FOR PURPOSES OF OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS DECEMBER 31. THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE

OF PLAN ASSETS IS DETERMINED BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUE AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF

PROJECTED BENEFIT DISTRIBUTIONS AT AN ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE

USED REFLECTS THE RATE AT WHICH WE BELIEVE THE PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS COULD

BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE, AS THOUGH THE PENSION BENEFITS

OF ALL PLAN PARTICIPANTS WERE DETERMINED AS OF THAT DATE. AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, THE DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE OUR PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION WERE 6.00% AND 6.50%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED PENSION

PLANS, WHICH ENCOMPASS OUR U.S. PLAN (INCLUDING NUVEEN INVESTMENTS PLAN), OUR

CANADA PLAN AND OUR U.K. PLANS. FOR OUR U.S. PLAN, WHICH CONSTITUTED 94% OF OUR

CONSOLIDATED PENSION PLAN ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, SUCH RATES WERE

DETERMINED BASED ON THE MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES AA LONG-TERM INDUSTRIAL DECEMBER AVERAGE

BOND YIELD WITH A DURATION OF APPROXIMATELY 11 TO 13 YEARS (WHICH CORRELATES TO

THE EXPECTED DURATION OF OUR PENSION OBLIGATIONS), ROUNDED UP TO THE NEAREST

QUARTER PERCENT.

TOTAL PENSION COST ENCOMPASSES THE COST OF SERVICE,

INTEREST COSTS BASED ON AN ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE, AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND AMORTIZATION OF ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, ADJUSTED

FOR CURTAILMENT GAINS OR LOSSES, IF ANY. ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDE THE

IMPACT OF UNRECOGNIZED GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED OVER

THE EXPECTED FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES. ANY UNRECOGNIZED GAINS

OR LOSSES RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION

OR PLAN ASSETS RESULTING FROM EXPERIENCE THAT DIFFERS FROM THE EXPECTED RETURNS

AND FROM CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS ARE DEFERRED. TO THE EXTENT AN UNRECOGNIZED

GAIN OR LOSS EXCEEDS 10 PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION OR THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS (10 PERCENT CORRIDOR), THE EXCESS

IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE EXPECTED FUTURE SERVICE PERIODS OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES. AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, THE ACCUMULATED UNRECOGNIZED LOSS FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED PENSION PLANS

SUBJECT TO MINIMUM AMORTIZATION APPROXIMATED $305 MILLION, WHICH EXCEEDED THE

10 PERCENT CORRIDOR, AND WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER 12 YEARS. AS A RESULT, PENSION

COST IN 2004 IS EXPECTED TO INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION. THE

AMOUNT OF THE UNRECOGNIZED GAIN OR LOSS THAT IS LESS THAN THE 10% CORRIDOR, AND

IS THEREFORE NOT SUBJECT TO MINIMUM AMORTIZATION IN 2004, WAS APPROXIMATELY

$117 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

104

THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE PLANS

ACTUAL HISTORICAL RETURN RESULTS, THE EXPECTED ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS BY

INVESTMENT CLASS, MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. WE EVALUATE

ONLY WHETHER THE ACTUAL ALLOCATION HAS FALLEN WITHIN AN EXPECTED RANGE, AND WE

THEN EVALUATE ACTUAL ASSET RETURNS IN TOTAL, RATHER THAN BY ASSET CLASS, GIVING

CONSIDERATION TO THE FACT THAT OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS HAVE A HIGHER VOLATILITY

THAN OUR OTHER INVESTMENT CLASSES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MARKET IN

GENERAL. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE ACTUAL ALLOCATION OF PLAN ASSETS IN

COMPARISON WITH THE EXPECTED ALLOCATION RANGE, BOTH EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE

OF TOTAL PLAN ASSETS, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

FOR OUR U.S. PLAN ONLY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. OUR U.S. PLAN ACCOUNTED

FOR 95% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED PENSION PLAN ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, OUR DISCOUNT RATE

ASSUMPTION WAS DETERMINED BASED ON A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE RATES EXPECTED TO

BE USED TO SETTLE OUR OBLIGATIONS, CONSIDERING THE PORTION OF OUR OBLIGATION

EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED BY ANNUITY PAYMENTS AND THE PORTION EXPECTED TO BE

SETTLED BY LUMP SUM PAYMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, CONSIDERING THE IMPACT

OF THE PLAN DESIGN CHANGE TO ADD A CASH BALANCE FORMULA, WE DETERMINED THAT THE

VAST MAJORITY OF THE PARTICIPANTS ELECTING TO REMAIN UNDER THE TRADITIONAL

PENSION FORMULA WOULD SELECT THE ANNUITY PAYMENT OPTION. AS SUCH, WE DETERMINED

OUR PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS MORE APPROPRIATELY CALCULATED USING

STRICTLY THE RATE AT WHICH WE BELIEVED WE COULD SETTLE THE ANNUITY OBLIGATIONS.

BASED ON OUR ASSUMPTION THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PARTICIPANTS ELECTING TO

REMAIN UNDER THE TRADITIONAL PENSION FORMULA WOULD SELECT THE ANNUITY PAYMENT

OPTION, WE ELIMINATED FROM OUR DISCOUNT RATE DETERMINATION THE LOWER RATE THAT

WE ASSUME WOULD OTHERWISE BE USED TO SETTLE LUMP SUM PAYMENTS, AND THEREBY

INCREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001. IN 2002, THE

DECLINING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT CAUSED US TO REDUCE OUR DISCOUNT RATE AND

LTROR AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. IN 2003, THE DECLINING INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT CAUSED US TO REDUCE OUR DISCOUNT RATE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003.

THE LTROR REMAINED THE SAME.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, INVESTMENT AND FUNDING DECISIONS

AND PENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR BENEFIT PLANS  INVESTMENT COMMITTEE REGULARLY EVALUATES

INVESTMENT RETURNS, ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGIES, POSSIBLE PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS,

AND PLAN ASSUMPTIONS. REGARDLESS OF THE EXTENT OF OUR ANALYSIS OF SUCH FACTORS,

PLAN ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT JUDGMENTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN ECONOMIC

FACTORS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ASSUMPTIONS WILL PROVE TO BE

CORRECT OR THAT THEY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS OVER TIME. FOR

PURPOSES

105

OF COMPARISON, FOR THE

SIX-YEAR PERIOD AND 20-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, OUR

ARITHMETIC AVERAGE ACTUAL RETURNS ON OUR U.S. PLAN ASSETS WERE 6.70% AND

12.56%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR 2003 AND 7.71% AND 12.48%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR 2002. FUNDING

DECISIONS ARE MADE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MINIMUM

REGULATORY FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, THE MAXIMUM TAX-DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS, THE

ESTIMATED MARKET VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS IN RELATION TO OUR ACCUMULATED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION, CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER BUSINESS FACTORS. DURING 2002,

WE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U.S. PLAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM PLANS OF

APPROXIMATELY $149 MILLION AND $9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, THAT WERE PRIMARILY

NECESSITATED BY THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS

HELD BY THE PLANS, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH GENERAL MARKET TRENDS DURING 2002.

DURING 2003, WE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U.S. PLAN AND THE FOREIGN PLANS OF

APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION AND $6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IMPACT OF

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO BE ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE

IN DECEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 148,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE, WHICH

PROVIDES ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF TRANSITION FOR A VOLUNTARY CHANGE TO THE FAIR

VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. THIS

STATEMENT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN THE EVENT OF A VOLUNTARY CHANGE. IT

ALSO NO LONGER PERMITS THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL PROSPECTIVE METHOD OF TRANSITION

FOR CHANGES TO THE FAIR VALUE BASED METHOD FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2003. WE CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD,

AND HAVE NOT MADE A DETERMINATION REGARDING ANY CHANGE TO THE FAIR VALUE

METHOD.

AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 12 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED A

REVISED VERSION OF FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, 

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

 (FIN 46(R)),

WHICH AGAIN DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R)

UNTIL THE FIRST INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2003, WHICH FOR US WOULD BE THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2004. UNDER THE

PARTIAL ADOPTION PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R), WE EARLY-ADOPTED THE CONSOLIDATION

AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF THIS INTERPRETATION IN 2003. OUR PARTIAL ADOPTION

SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED THE FOLLOWING ITEM.

·

LLOYDS SYNDICATES

WE PARTICIPATE IN

VARIOUS LLOYDS SYNDICATES AT VARYING LEVELS. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE

IMPLICATIONS OF FIN 46(R) WITH RESPECT TO THESE SYNDICATES, AND AT THIS TIME WE

ARE NOT ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

ON JANUARY 12, 2004,

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION

NO. FAS 106-1, 

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

 (FSP 106-1). THIS PRONOUNCEMENT

PROVIDES COMPANIES WITH THE OPTION TO MAKE A ONE-TIME ELECTION TO DEFER

ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICARE ACT REFERENCED IN ITS TITLE (THE

ACT). WE HAVE DECIDED TO DEFER ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACT UNDER FSP 106-1 AND

HAVE MADE THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURES IN NOTE 13RETIREMENT PLANS TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FINAL ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE COULD REQUIRE

CHANGES TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED INFORMATION. WE WILL MONITOR THE FASB

DELIBERATIONS AND ACCOUNT FOR THE ACT BASED ON THE PRONOUNCEMENT EXPECTED TO BE

ISSUED.

DEFINITIONS OF

CERTAIN STATUTORY ACCOUNTING TERMS

STATUTORY

EXPENSE RATIO

(A

STATUTORY FINANCIAL MEASURE):   THE COMPANY USES THE STATUTORY DEFINITION

OF EXPENSES IN CALCULATING EXPENSE RATIOS DISCLOSED. EXPENSES ARE DIVIDED BY

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS TO ARRIVE AT THE EXPENSE RATIO. STATUTORY EXPENSES

DIFFER FROM GAAP EXPENSES PRIMARILY WITH REGARD TO POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS,

WHICH ARE NOT DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED FOR STATUTORY PURPOSES, BUT RATHER

RECOGNIZED AS

107

INCURRED. IN ADDITION, THE

GAAP EXPENSE RATIO USES NET EARNED PREMIUMS RATHER THAN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS AS

THE DENOMINATOR.

STATUTORY

LOSS RATIO

(

A STATUTORY FINANCIAL MEASURE):   THE

COMPANY USES THE STATUTORY DEFINITION OF LOSS RATIO. THIS RATIO IS CALCULATED

BY DIVIDING LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES INCURRED BY NET EARNED

PREMIUMS. NET EARNED PREMIUMS AND LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, ARE BOTH

GAAP AND STATUTORY MEASURES.

STATUTORY

COMBINED RATIO

(

A STATUTORY FINANCIAL MEASURE):   THE

SUM OF THE STATUTORY EXPENSE RATIO AND THE STATUTORY LOSS RATIO.

NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS

(A STATUTORY FINANCIAL MEASURE) AND

NET EARNED PREMIUMS

(A GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE):   NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS ARE A STATUTORY MEASURE OF PREMIUM VOLUME THAT DIFFERS FROM

THE NET EARNED PREMIUMS REPORTED IN OUR GAAP STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. WRITTEN

PREMIUMS FOR A PERIOD CAN BE RECONCILED TO EARNED PREMIUMS BY ADDING OR

SUBTRACTING THE CHANGE IN UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES IN THE PERIOD.

UNDERWRITING RESULTS BY SEGMENT

(

A GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURE):   OUR REPORTED UNDERWRITING RESULTS ARE OUR BEST MEASURE OF

PROFITABILITY FOR OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS AND ACCORDINGLY

ARE DISCLOSED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRED BY SFAS

NO.131 DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION.

UNDERWRITING RESULTS ARE CALCULATED BY SUBTRACTING INCURRED LOSSES AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES AND UNDERWRITING EXPENSES (AS ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS SUCH AS

THE IMPACT OF DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS) FROM NET EARNED PREMIUMS. WE

DO NOT ALLOCATE NET INVESTMENT INCOME TO OUR RESPECTIVE UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

THE ST. PAUL

COMPANIES

EXPOSURES TO MARKET

RISK

MARKET RISK CAN BE DESCRIBED AS THE RISK OF CHANGE IN

FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, EQUITY

PRICES, CREDITWORTHINESS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OR OTHER FACTORS. WE SEEK TO

MITIGATE THAT RISK BY A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. OUR POLICIES TO

ADDRESS THESE RISKS IN 2003 WERE UNCHANGED FROM 2002. IN 2002, THE ONLY

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR MARKET RISK FROM 2001 WERE A REDUCED ALLOCATION OF

ASSETS TO OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, AND A REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATED

DURATION OF OUR FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, WHICH INCLUDES OUR

CONSOLIDATED HOLDINGS OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, SECURITIES ON LOAN AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.

AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

SECTION OF

THIS DISCUSSION, THERE ARE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO OUR ASSESSMENT OF

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

INTEREST RATE RISKOUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES IS CONCENTRATED IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, AND TO A

LESSER EXTENT, OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN INVESTMENT VALUES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE MITIGATED BY CORRESPONDING AND

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF OUR INSURANCE RESERVES

AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. WE MONITOR THIS EXPOSURE THROUGH PERIODIC REVIEWS OF OUR

ASSET AND LIABILITY POSITIONS. OUR ESTIMATES OF CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS THE

IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS RELATING TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND

INSURANCE RESERVES, ARE MODELED AND REVIEWED QUARTERLY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF OUR FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

(CONSOLIDATED HOLDINGS OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, SECURITIES ON LOAN AND SHORT

TERM INVESTMENTS) WAS 3.8 YEARS, COMPARED WITH 3.3 YEARS AT DECEMBER 31,

2002. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT DURING THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2003

NEW MODELING CAPABILITIES FOR ESTIMATING THE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF MUNICIPAL

BONDS WERE INTRODUCED TO REPLACE PREVIOUS ESTIMATES BASED ON THE MARKET

YIELD-TO-WORST. THE EFFECT OF

108

THIS CHANGE WAS TO

INCREASE THE ESTIMATE OF OVERALL DURATION BY APPROXIMATELY 0.3 YEARS OVER AND

ABOVE WHAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED FROM THE APPLICATION OF PREVIOUS ESTIMATION

PROCEDURES.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES PRINCIPAL CASH FLOW ESTIMATES BY YEAR FOR OUR DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002 HOLDINGS OF INTEREST-SENSITIVE INVESTMENT ASSETS CONSIDERED TO BE

OTHER THAN TRADING. THOSE HOLDINGS CONSIST OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FIXED INCOME

SECURITIES, SECURITIES ON LOAN, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, MORTGAGE LOANS AND

CERTAIN SECURITIES ISSUED AS PART OF A SERIES OF INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. ALSO

PROVIDED ARE THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH YEARS

CASH FLOWS. PRINCIPAL CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FOR COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE

OBLIGATIONS AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WERE PREPARED USING THIRD-PARTY

PREPAYMENT MODELS AND ESTIMATES. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGHS

WERE PREPARED USING CONSENSUS PREPAYMENT FORECASTS OBTAINABLE FROM A

THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER. PRINCIPAL CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR CALLABLE BONDS ARE

EITHER TO MATURITY OR TO THE NEXT CALL DATE DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE CALL WAS

PROJECTED TO BE IN-THE-MONEY ASSUMING NO CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. NO

PROJECTION OF THE IMPACT OF REINVESTING THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS IS INCLUDED IN

THE TABLE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CASH FLOW SOURCE IS A SHORT-TERM OR

LONG-TERM FIXED MATURITY SECURITY. OUR FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY

HELD TO PAY LIABILITIES INHERENT IN OUR INSURANCE RESERVES. THE COMPOSITION OF

OUR PORTFOLIOS ESTIMATED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST RUNOFF HELPS ENSURE THAT

ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO FUND EACH YEARS ESTIMATED

INSURANCE LIABILITY PAYMENTS, AS SUCH PAYMENTS BECOME DUE.

TO MITIGATE A PORTION OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK

RELATED TO CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED RATE MEDIUM-TERM AND SENIOR NOTES, WE HAVE

ENTERED INTO A NUMBER OF PAY-FLOATING, RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS THAT, IN THE AGGREGATE, HAVE A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $730 MILLION. OF

THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAPS, $330 MILLION MATURE IN 2005, $150

MILLION MATURE IN 2008 AND $250 MILLION MATURE IN 2010, WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE

PAY RATE OF 3.19% AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE RECEIVE RATE OF 7.57%. THESE SWAPS HAD

A FAIR VALUE OF $46 MILLION AND $65 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY.

IN 2003, WE INCLUDED DEBT OWED TO FIVE BUSINESS TRUSTS

THAT HAVE ISSUED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, THE

OBLIGATIONS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FULLY GUARANTEED BY US. AS DISCUSSED IN FURTHER

DETAIL IN THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SECTION OF THIS REPORT, IN

2003 WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FIN46(R), WHICH RESULTED IN THE

DECONSOLIDATION OF THESE TRUSTS FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS

A RESULT, THE DEBT WE ISSUED TO THESE TRUSTS (PREVIOUSLY ELIMINATED IN

CONSOLIDATION) IS NOW SHOWN IN OUR CONSOLIDATED DEBT OUTSTANDING, WHEREAS THE

PREFERRED SECURITIES, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET BETWEEN LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, ARE NO LONGER INCLUDED IN

OUR BALANCE SHEET. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON THE DEBT OWED TO THE

FIVE TRUSTS WAS 7.8 % AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002. THE FAIR VALUE OF

THESE SECURITIES WAS $1.03 BILLION AND $959 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. APPROXIMATELY $575 MILLION OF THE SECURITIES ARE

CALLABLE AT THE COMPANYS OPTION AFTER NOVEMBER 13, 2006. AN ADDITIONAL

$78 MILLION ARE CALLABLE AT THE COMPANYS OPTION BETWEEN 2007 AND THEIR

MATURITY IN 2027.

CREDIT RISKOUR PORTFOLIOS OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES,

MORTGAGE LOANS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT SHORT-TERM AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE

SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK. THIS RISK IS DEFINED AS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN MARKET

VALUE RESULTING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BORROWERS ABILITY TO REPAY THE

DEBT. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO EARN COMPETITIVE RELATIVE RETURNS BY INVESTING IN A

DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF SECURITIES. WE MANAGE THIS RISK BY UP-FRONT, STRINGENT

UNDERWRITING ANALYSIS, REVIEWS BY A CREDIT COMMITTEE AND REGULAR MEETINGS TO

REVIEW CREDIT DEVELOPMENTS. WATCHLISTS ARE MAINTAINED FOR EXPOSURES REQUIRING

ADDITIONAL REVIEW, AND ALL CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE REVIEWED AT LEAST ANNUALLY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, APPROXIMATELY 98% OF OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO WAS RATED INVESTMENT

GRADE.

IN CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS, WE UNDERWRITE CERTAIN

BUSINESS FOR SOPHISTICATED INSURANCE PURCHASERS, AND REINSURE A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF THAT RISK WITH TRADITIONAL REINSURERS OR CAPTIVE INSURANCE ENTITIES.

ALTHOUGH THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY COLLATERALIZED, THERE IS A DEGREE OF

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS. WE PERFORM CREDIT REVIEWS OF

THE UNDERLYING FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE INSURED AND/OR ASSUMING REINSURANCE

ENTITY AS PART OF OUR PROGRAM TO MANAGE THIS RISK.

WE ALSO HAVE OTHER RECEIVABLE AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO

CREDIT RISK. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE ARE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. TO

MITIGATE THE RISK OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES NONPAYMENT OF AMOUNTS DUE, WE

ESTABLISH BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL STANDARDS FOR REINSURER APPROVAL,

INCORPORATING RATINGS BY MAJOR RATING AGENCIES AND CONSIDERING CURRENT MARKET

INFORMATION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSUREOUR EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK

FOR CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IS CONCENTRATED IN OUR INVESTED ASSETS,

AND INSURANCE RESERVES, DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. CASH FLOWS FROM OUR

FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR OUR PURCHASE OF

INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE PURCHASE THESE INVESTMENTS

PRIMARILY TO HEDGE INSURANCE RESERVES AND OTHER LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN THE

SAME CURRENCY, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE.

FOR THOSE FOREIGN INSURANCE OPERATIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AT THE END OF 2001

AS BUSINESSES TO BE EXITED, WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MATCH THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED LIABILITIES WITH ASSETS IN THE SAME CURRENCY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, APPROXIMATELY 13% OF OUR INVESTED ASSETS WERE DENOMINATED IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING

COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 7% OF OUR TOTAL INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31,

2003. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT A HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF THE

POUND STERLING WOULD HAVE AN APPROXIMATE $165 MILLION REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF

OUR ASSETS, ALTHOUGH THERE WOULD BE A SIMILAR OFFSETTING

110

CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE

RELATED INSURANCE RESERVES. NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY ACCOUNTS FOR

MORE THAN 4% OF OUR INVESTED ASSETS.

WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARDS WITH

A U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $203.5 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003 TO HEDGE OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON CERTAIN CONTRACTS. OF THIS

TOTAL, 78% ARE DENOMINATED IN BRITISH POUND STERLING, 12% ARE DENOMINATED IN

THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, AND 10% ARE DENOMINATED IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR.

EQUITY PRICE RISKOUR PORTFOLIO OF MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES, WHICH WE CARRY ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AT MARKET VALUE, HAS EXPOSURE

TO PRICE RISK. THIS RISK IS DEFINED AS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN MARKET VALUE RESULTING

FROM AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN PRICES. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO EARN COMPETITIVE RELATIVE

RETURNS BY INVESTING IN A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY, LIQUID SECURITIES.

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS ARE ANALYZED REGULARLY AND MARKET RISK IS ACTIVELY

MANAGED THROUGH A VARIETY OF MODELING TECHNIQUES. OUR HOLDINGS ARE DIVERSIFIED

ACROSS INDUSTRIES, AND CONCENTRATIONS IN ANY ONE COMPANY OR INDUSTRY ARE

LIMITED BY PARAMETERS ESTABLISHED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS BY STATUTORY

REQUIREMENTS.

INCLUDED IN OUR OTHER INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002 WAS OUR 14% EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS,

LTD. (PLATINUM), RECEIVED AS PARTIAL CONSIDERATION FROM THE TRANSFER OF OUR

ONGOING REINSURANCE BUSINESS TO PLATINUM. WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN

PLATINUM USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THEREFORE, CHANGES IN PLATINUMS

STOCK PRICE DO NOT IMPACT OUR BALANCE SHEET OR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS, UNLESS

OUR INVESTMENT IN PLATINUM WAS DEEMED TO BE IMPAIRED. ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR

OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS FOR PLATINUM. THE WARRANTS HAD A

VALUE OF $65 MILLION AND  $61 MILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE WARRANTS ARE CONSIDERED

DERIVATIVES AND ARE MARKED TO MARKET QUARTERLY, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

BEING RECOGNIZED AS REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES IN OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THE

WARRANTS ARE VALUED USING THE ROLL-GESKE-WHALEY VALUATION MODEL AND AS SUCH ARE

IMPACTED BY THE MARKET PRICE OF PLATINUM STOCK.

OUR PORTFOLIO OF VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ALSO HAS

EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISKS, PRIMARILY RELATING TO THE VIABILITY OF THE VARIOUS

ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE INVESTED. THESE INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY IN EARLY-STAGE

COMPANIES, INVOLVE MORE RISK THAN OTHER INVESTMENTS, AND WE ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR

MARKET RISK IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. FIRST, WE ALLOCATE A COMPARATIVELY SMALL

AMOUNT OF FUNDS TO VENTURE CAPITAL. AT THE END OF 2003, THE COST OF THESE

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 2% OF TOTAL INVESTED ASSETS. SECOND, THE

INVESTMENTS ARE DIVERSIFIED TO AVOID EXCESSIVE CONCENTRATION OF RISK IN A

PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. THIRD, WE PERFORM EXTENSIVE RESEARCH PRIOR TO INVESTING IN

A NEW VENTURE TO GAUGE PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS. FOURTH, WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE

OPERATIONAL RESULTS OF THE ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE INVESTED. FINALLY, WE GENERALLY

SELL OUR HOLDINGS IN THESE FIRMS SOON AFTER THEY BECOME PUBLICLY TRADED WHEN WE

ARE LEGALLY ABLE TO DO SO, THEREBY REDUCING EXPOSURE TO FURTHER MARKET RISK.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES WERE RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUE OF $171 MILLION. A

HYPOTHETICAL 10% DECLINE IN EACH STOCKS PRICE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A $17 MILLION

IMPACT ON FAIR VALUE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, OUR VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS WERE RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUE OF $535 MILLION. A HYPOTHETICAL

10% DECLINE IN EACH INVESTMENTS FAIR VALUE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A $54

MILLION IMPACT ON FAIR VALUE.

CATASTROPHE RISKWE MANAGE AND MONITOR OUR AGGREGATE

PROPERTY CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE THROUGH VARIOUS METHODS, INCLUDING PURCHASING

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE, ESTABLISHING UNDERWRITING RESTRICTIONS AND APPLYING A

DEDICATED CATASTROPHE PRICING MODEL.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS,

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS

IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003. THESE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE

THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31,

SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES



WE

PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED STATES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). WE FOLLOW THE ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) AND

THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA).

CONSOLIDATION



WE COMBINE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH

THOSE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND PRESENT THEM ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF MATERIAL

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND US OR AMONG OUR SUBSIDIARIES. CERTAIN

OF OUR FOREIGN UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS RESULTS, AND THE RESULTS OF CERTAIN OF

OUR INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIPS, ARE RECORDED ON A ONE-MONTH TO ONE-QUARTER LAG

DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS IN OBTAINING AND ANALYZING SUCH RESULTS FOR INCLUSION

IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A CURRENT BASIS. IN THE EVENT THAT

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OCCUR DURING THE LAG PERIOD, THE IMPACT IS INCLUDED IN THE

CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, WE ELIMINATED THE

ONE-QUARTER REPORTING LAG FOR OUR OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS. THE EFFECT OF

REPORTING THOSE OPERATIONS ON A CURRENT BASIS WAS A $34 MILLION REDUCTION TO

OUR 2003 PRETAX INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. DURING 2001, WE ELIMINATED

THE ONE-QUARTER REPORTING LAG FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRIMARY UNDERWRITING

OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THE EFFECT OF REPORTING THOSE OPERATIONS ON A

CURRENT BASIS WAS A $31 MILLION INCREASE TO OUR 2001 PRETAX LOSS FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

RELATED

PARTY TRANSACTIONS



THE

FOLLOWING SUMMARIZES OUR RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.

INDEBTEDNESS OF MANAGEMENT



WE HAVE MADE LOANS TO CERTAIN CURRENT AND

FORMER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOR THEIR PURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN

MARKET. THESE ARE FULL-RECOURSE LOANS, FURTHER SECURED BY A PLEDGE OF THE STOCK

PURCHASED WITH THE PROCEEDS. THE LOANS ACCRUE INTEREST AT THE APPLICABLE

FEDERAL RATE FOR LOANS OF SUCH MATURITY. LOANS TO FORMER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE

BEING REPAID IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREED-UPON TERMS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVABLE

UNDER THIS PROGRAM, INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, WAS $1 MILLION AND $7 MILLION

ON DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THIS PROGRAM WAS TERMINATED

EFFECTIVE MARCH 20, 2002; CONSEQUENTLY, NO NEW LOANS WERE MADE AFTER THAT

DATE.

INDEBTEDNESS OF VENTURE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

WE

HAVE MADE LOANS TO CERTAIN MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT OF OUR VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENT OPERATION. THE LOANS ARE SECURED BY EACH INDIVIDUALS OWNERSHIP

INTEREST IN THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES THAT HOLD MOST OF OUR VENTURE

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, AND ACCRUE INTEREST AT THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL RATE FOR

LOANS OF SUCH MATURITY. THE TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVABLE UNDER THIS PROGRAM,

INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, WAS $7 MILLION.

PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD. (PLATINUM)

SEE

NOTE 19 IN THIS REPORT FOR A SUMMARY OF RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS WITH

PLATINUM.

DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS



SEE

NOTE 17 IN THIS REPORT FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

RECLASSIFICATIONS



WE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN OUR

2002 AND 2001 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO CONFORM TO THE

2003 PRESENTATION. THESE RECLASSIFICATIONS HAD NO EFFECT ON NET INCOME, OR

COMMON OR PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FOR THOSE

YEARS.

USE OF ESTIMATES



WE MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS THAT WE REPORT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATING TO OUR

119

RESERVES FOR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. WE CONTINUALLY REVIEW

OUR ESTIMATES AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY, BUT ACTUAL RESULTS COULD TURN

OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE EXPECTED WHEN WE MADE THESE

ESTIMATES.

ACCOUNTING FOR OUR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS

PREMIUMS

EARNED



PREMIUMS

ON INSURANCE POLICIES ARE OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE. FOR ALL OF OUR

NON-LLOYDS BUSINESS, WE RECOGNIZE PREMIUMS AS REVENUES EVENLY OVER THE POLICY

TERMS USING THE DAILY PRO RATA METHOD. IN 2003, WE CHANGED THE METHOD BY WHICH

WE RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUE AT OUR OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS. PRIOR TO 2003, SUCH

REVENUE WAS RECOGNIZED USING THE ONE-EIGHTHS METHOD, WHEREBY WE CONVERTED

LLOYDS SYNDICATE ACCOUNTS TO U.S. GAAP ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. SINCE LLOYDS

ACCOUNTING DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE CONCEPT OF EARNED PREMIUM, WE CALCULATED

EARNED PREMIUM AS PART OF THE CONVERSION TO GAAP, ASSUMING BUSINESS WAS WRITTEN

AT THE MIDDLE OF EACH QUARTER, EFFECTIVELY BREAKING THE CALENDAR YEAR INTO

EARNINGS PERIODS OF EIGHTHS. IN 2003, WE BEGAN RECOGNIZING LLOYDS PREMIUM

REVENUE IN A MANNER THAT MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE UNDERLYING POLICY TERMS

AND EXPOSURES AND IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE METHOD BY WHICH WE RECOGNIZE

PREMIUM REVENUE IN OUR NON-LLOYDS BUSINESS. THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2003.

REVENUES IN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION INCLUDE PREMIUMS

GENERATED FROM EXTENDED REPORTING ENDORSEMENTS. OUR MEDICAL LIABILITY

CLAIMS-MADE POLICIES GAVE OUR INSUREDS THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE A REPORTING

ENDORSEMENT, WHICH IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS TAIL COVERAGE, AT THE TIME THEIR

POLICIES EXPIRED. THIS ENDORSEMENT PROTECTED AN INSURED AGAINST ANY CLAIMS THAT

ARISE FROM A MEDICAL INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED WHILE THE CLAIMS-MADE POLICY WAS IN

FORCE, BUT WHICH HAD NOT YET BEEN REPORTED BY THE TIME THE POLICY EXPIRED. PREMIUMS

ON THESE ENDORSEMENTS ARE FULLY EARNED AS REVENUE, AND THE EXPECTED LOSSES ARE

RESERVED, AT THE TIME THE ENDORSEMENT IS WRITTEN.

WE RECORD PREMIUMS THAT WE HAVE NOT YET RECOGNIZED AS

REVENUES AS UNEARNED PREMIUMS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. ASSUMED REINSURANCE

PREMIUMS ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUES PROPORTIONATELY OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD.

PREMIUMS EARNED ARE RECORDED IN OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS, NET OF OUR COST TO

PURCHASE REINSURANCE.

INSURANCE

LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES



LOSSES REPRESENT THE AMOUNTS WE PAID OR

EXPECT TO PAY TO CLAIMANTS FOR EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. THE COSTS OF

INVESTIGATING, RESOLVING AND PROCESSING THESE CLAIMS ARE KNOWN AS LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES (LAE). WE RECORD THESE ITEMS ON OUR STATEMENT OF

OPERATIONS NET OF REINSURANCE, MEANING THAT WE REDUCE OUR GROSS LOSSES AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE AMOUNTS WE HAVE RECOVERED OR EXPECT TO

RECOVER UNDER REINSURANCE CONTRACTS.

REINSURANCE

WRITTEN

PREMIUMS, EARNED PREMIUMS AND INCURRED INSURANCE LOSSES AND LAE ALL REFLECT THE

NET EFFECTS OF ASSUMED AND CEDED REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. ASSUMED REINSURANCE

REFERS TO OUR ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS THAT OTHER INSURANCE

COMPANIES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN. ASSUMED REINSURANCE HAS, FOR THE MOST PART, BEEN

WRITTEN THROUGH OUR ST. PAUL RE OPERATION. DURING 2002, WE TRANSFERRED OUR

ONGOING BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN THROUGH ST. PAUL RE TO PLATINUM

UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD. SEE NOTE 19 FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF

THIS TRANSFER. CEDED REINSURANCE MEANS OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE AGREED TO

SHARE CERTAIN RISKS WITH US. REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING IS FOLLOWED FOR ASSUMED AND

CEDED TRANSACTIONS WHEN RISK TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET. THESE

REQUIREMENTS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE RELATED TO THE AMOUNT

AND TIMING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS THE INTERPRETATION OF UNDERLYING

CONTRACT TERMS.

INSURANCE

RESERVES



WE

ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR THE ESTIMATED TOTAL UNPAID COST OF LOSSES AND LAE, WHICH

COVER EVENTS THAT OCCURRED IN 2003 AND PRIOR YEARS. THESE RESERVES REFLECT OUR

ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL COST OF CLAIMS THAT WERE REPORTED TO US (CASE

RESERVES), BUT NOT YET PAID, AND THE COST OF CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT YET

REPORTED TO US (IBNR). WE REDUCE OUR LOSS RESERVES FOR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS OF

SALVAGE AND

120

SUBROGATION RECOVERIES.

ESTIMATED AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ON PAID AND UNPAID LOSSES AND

LAE, NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNRECOVERABLE AMOUNTS, ARE REFLECTED AS

ASSETS.

FOR REPORTED LOSSES, WE ESTABLISH RESERVES ON A CASE

BASIS WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF COVERAGE PROVIDED IN THE INSURANCE POLICY OR

REINSURANCE AGREEMENT. FOR IBNR LOSSES, WE ESTIMATE RESERVES USING ESTABLISHED

ACTUARIAL METHODS. OUR CASE AND IBNR RESERVE ESTIMATES CONSIDER SUCH VARIABLES

AS PAST LOSS EXPERIENCE, CHANGES IN LEGISLATIVE CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL LIABILITY AND POLICY COVERAGES, AND INFLATION. WE

CONSIDER NOT ONLY MONETARY INCREASES IN THE COST OF WHAT WE INSURE, BUT ALSO

CHANGES IN SOCIETAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE JURY VERDICTS AND CASE LAW AND, IN

TURN, CLAIM COSTS.

BECAUSE MANY OF THE COVERAGES WE OFFER INVOLVE CLAIMS

THAT MAY NOT ULTIMATELY BE SETTLED FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THEY ARE INCURRED,

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AS TO OUR ULTIMATE EXPOSURE TO LOSSES ARE AN INTEGRAL AND

NECESSARY COMPONENT OF OUR LOSS RESERVING PROCESS. WE RECORD OUR RESERVES BY

CONSIDERING A RANGE OF ESTIMATES BOUNDED BY A HIGH AND LOW POINT. WITHIN THAT

RANGE, WE RECORD MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE. WE CONTINUALLY REVIEW OUR

RESERVES, USING A VARIETY OF STATISTICAL AND ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES TO ANALYZE

CURRENT CLAIM COSTS, FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY DATA, AND PREVAILING ECONOMIC,

SOCIAL AND LEGAL FACTORS. WE ADJUST RESERVES ESTABLISHED IN PRIOR YEARS AS LOSS

EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. ADJUSTMENTS TO

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED RESERVES ARE REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN THE

PERIODS IN WHICH THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATE ARE MADE.

RESERVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS EXPOSURES

CANNOT BE ESTIMATED SOLELY WITH THE TRADITIONAL LOSS RESERVING TECHNIQUES

DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH RELY ON HISTORICAL ACCIDENT YEAR DEVELOPMENT FACTORS AND

TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED VARIABLES. ENVIRONMENTAL AND

ASBESTOS RESERVES ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THAN OUR OTHER LOSS RESERVES

BECAUSE OF LEGAL ISSUES, SOCIETAL FACTORS AND DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE

PARTIES WHO MAY ULTIMATELY BE HELD LIABLE. THEREFORE, IN ADDITION TO TAKING

INTO CONSIDERATION THE TRADITIONAL VARIABLES THAT ARE UTILIZED TO ARRIVE AT OUR

OTHER LOSS RESERVE AMOUNTS, WE ALSO LOOK AT THE LENGTH OF TIME NECESSARY TO

CLEAN UP POLLUTED SITES, CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING THE IDENTITY OF THE

RESPONSIBLE PARTY, THE DEGREE OF REMEDIATION DEEMED TO BE NECESSARY, THE

ESTIMATED TIME PERIOD FOR LITIGATION EXPENSES, JUDICIAL EXPANSIONS OF COVERAGE,

MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS ARISING WITH ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS ADVANCED AGE, CASE LAW,

AND THE HISTORY OF PRIOR CLAIM DEVELOPMENT. WE ALSO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF

CHANGES IN THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE WESTERN

MACARTHUR MATTER, IN ESTABLISHING OUR RESERVES FOR OTHER ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CASES. GENERALLY, CASE RESERVES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED WHERE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN OBTAINED TO

INDICATE COVERAGE UNDER A SPECIFIC INSURANCE POLICY. WE ALSO CONSIDER END OF

PERIOD RESERVES IN RELATION TO PAID LOSSES IN A PERIOD. FURTHERMORE, IBNR

RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED TO COVER ADDITIONAL ESTIMATED EXPOSURES RELATED TO

POLICYHOLDERS THAT HAVENT AS YET ASSERTED ANY CLAIMS AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT ON

RESERVES ASSUMED FROM OTHER ENTITIES. THESE RESERVES ARE CONTINUALLY REVIEWED

AND UPDATED AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS ACQUIRED.

WHILE OUR REPORTED RESERVES MAKE

A REASONABLE PROVISION FOR OUR UNPAID LOSS AND LAE OBLIGATIONS, IT SHOULD BE

NOTED THAT THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING REQUIRED RESERVES, BY ITS VERY NATURE,

INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY. THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY CAN BE INFLUENCED BY

FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXISTENCE OF COVERAGE WITH LONG DURATION PAYMENT PATTERNS

AND CHANGES IN CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES, AS WELL AS THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE. ULTIMATE

ACTUAL PAYMENTS FOR CLAIMS AND LAE COULD TURN OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT

FROM OUR ESTIMATES.

OUR LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE RELATED TO

TABULAR WORKERS COMPENSATION AND CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE COVERAGE ARE

DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS. PRIOR TO

DISCOUNTING, THESE LIABILITIES TOTALED $875 MILLION AND $887 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTAL DISCOUNTED LIABILITY REFLECTED ON OUR

BALANCE SHEET WAS $710 MILLION AND $718 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE LIABILITY FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION WAS DISCOUNTED

USING RATES OF UP TO 3.5%. THE LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE

COVERAGE WAS DISCOUNTED USING RATES UP

121

TO 7.5%, BASED ON OUR

RETURN ON INVESTED ASSETS OR, IN MANY CASES, ON YIELDS CONTRACTUALLY GUARANTEED

TO US ON FUNDS HELD BY THE CEDING COMPANY, AS PERMITTED BY THE STATE OF

DOMICILE. TABULAR WORKERS COMPENSATION RESERVES ARE INDEMNITY RESERVES THAT

ARE CALCULATED USING DISCOUNTS DETERMINED WITH REFERENCE TO ACTUARIAL TABLES

THAT INCORPORATE INTEREST AND CONTINGENCIES SUCH AS MORTALITY, REMARRIAGE,

INFLATION OR RECOVERY FROM DISABILITY APPLIED TO A REASONABLY DETERMINABLE

PAYMENT STREAM. RESERVES FOR MEDICAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORK PLACE

INJURY AND RESERVES FOR LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

LLOYDS



WE PARTICIPATE IN LLOYDS AS THE OWNER OF

A MANAGING AGENCY AND THE PROVIDER OF CAPITAL TO THE SYNDICATES MANAGED BY THAT

MANAGING AGENCY. LLOYDS SYNDICATES DETERMINE THEIR UNDERWRITING RESULTS ON AN

UNDERWRITING YEAR BASIS WITH RESULTS BEING DECLARED ONLY AFTER THREE YEARS. IN

CONVERTING FROM LLOYDS ACCOUNTING TO U.S. GAAP THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

ADJUSTMENTS RELATE TO THE EARNING OF PREMIUMS AND THE RECOGNITION OF LOSSES ON

AN ACCIDENT YEAR BASIS. WHERE WE DO NOT PROVIDE 100% OF THE CAPITAL TO A

SYNDICATE WE RECORD OUR PRO RATA SHARE OF SYNDICATE ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUES AND EXPENSES. (ALSO SEE DISCUSSION UNDER PREMIUMS EARNED ABOVE.)

POLICY

ACQUISITION EXPENSES



THE

COSTS DIRECTLY RELATED TO WRITING AN INSURANCE POLICY ARE REFERRED TO AS POLICY

ACQUISITION EXPENSES AND CONSIST OF COMMISSIONS, STATE PREMIUM TAXES AND OTHER

DIRECT UNDERWRITING EXPENSES. ALTHOUGH THESE EXPENSES ARE INCURRED WHEN WE

ISSUE A POLICY, WE DEFER AND AMORTIZE THEM OVER THE SAME PERIOD AS THE

CORRESPONDING PREMIUMS ARE RECORDED AS REVENUES. ON A REGULAR BASIS, WE PERFORM

A RECOVERABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS IN RELATION

TO THE EXPECTED RECOGNITION OF REVENUES, INCLUDING ANTICIPATED INVESTMENT

INCOME, AND REFLECT ADJUSTMENTS, IF ANY, AS PERIOD COSTS. SHOULD THE ANALYSIS

INDICATE THAT THE ACQUISITION COSTS ARE UNRECOVERABLE, FURTHER ANALYSES ARE

PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF A RESERVE IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FOR LOSSES, WHICH

MAY EXCEED THE RELATED UNEARNED PREMIUMS.

ALLOWANCE

FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS



OUR

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES RECEIVABLE IS

CALCULATED BY APPLYING AN ESTIMATED BAD DEBT PERCENTAGE TO AN AGING OF

RECEIVABLES SEGMENTED BY BUSINESS UNIT TO DETERMINE GENERAL COLLECTIBILITY. SPECIFIC

COLLECTION ISSUES ARE HIGHLIGHTED SEPARATELY, AND A COMPARISON OF PRIOR YEAR

WRITE-OFFS WITH YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS IS MADE TO DETERMINE REASONABLENESS. WE

ALSO HAVE AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES THAT IS

CALCULATED BASED ON THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE

STATUS OF THE REINSURER, THE NATURE OF THE BALANCE AND WHETHER OR NOT THE

AMOUNT IS IN DISPUTE. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

INVOLVES JUDGMENT AND THEREFORE CREATES A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO ADEQUACY

AT EACH REPORTING DATE.

GUARANTEE FUND AND OTHER

INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS



WE ESTABLISH AN ACCRUAL RELATED TO

ESTIMATED FUTURE GUARANTEE FUND PAYMENTS AND OTHER INSURANCE-RELATED

ASSESSMENTS, PRIMARILY SECOND INJURY FUNDS. GUARANTEE FUND PAYMENTS ARE BASED

ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS FOR SPECIFIC KNOWN EVENTS OR

INSOLVENCIES. LOSS-BASED SECOND INJURY FUND ASSESSMENTS ARE ACCRUED BASED ON

OUR TOTAL LOSS RESERVES FOR THE RELEVANT STATES AND LINES OF BUSINESS. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, WE CARRIED AN ACCRUAL OF $44 MILLION AND $43 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, FOR THESE PAYMENTS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE DISBURSED AS

ASSESSED DURING A PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS. WE ALSO ESTABLISH ASSETS RELATED TO

THE RECOVERY OF THESE COSTS WHEN APPROPRIATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

2002, WE CARRIED ASSETS OF $17 MILLION AND $15 MILLION FOR PREMIUM TAX OFFSETS,

RESPECTIVELY, AND $4 MILLION AND $11 MILLION FOR POLICY SURCHARGES,

RESPECTIVELY. THIS ACCRUAL IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE FOLLOWING REVISIONS TO

ASSESSMENTS THAT MAY BE ENACTED BY ANY OF THE STATES WHERE WE WRITE BUSINESS.

ACCOUNTING FOR OUR

ASSET MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS

WE HOLD A 79% INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INC.

(NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, FORMERLY THE JOHN NUVEEN COMPANY), WHICH CONSTITUTES OUR

ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENT. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS CORE BUSINESSES ARE ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND RELATED RESEARCH, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND

DISTRIBUTION OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR THE AFFLUENT,

HIGH-NET-WORTH AND INSTITUTIONAL MARKET

122

SEGMENTS. NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS DISTRIBUTES ITS INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING

INDIVIDUALLY MANAGED ACCOUNTS, CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS AND MUTUAL

FUNDS, TO THE AFFLUENT AND HIGH-NET-WORTH MARKET SEGMENTS THROUGH UNAFFILIATED

INTERMEDIARY FIRMS INCLUDING BROKER/DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, AFFILIATES OF

INSURANCE PROVIDERS, FINANCIAL PLANNERS, ACCOUNTANTS, CONSULTANTS AND

INVESTMENT ADVISORS. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ALSO PROVIDES MANAGED ACCOUNT SERVICES

TO SEVERAL INSTITUTIONAL MARKET SEGMENTS AND CHANNELS.

IN AUGUST 2002, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS PURCHASED NWQ

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY, INC. (NWQ), AN ASSET MANAGEMENT FIRM

BASED IN LOS ANGELES WITH APPROXIMATELY $6.9 BILLION OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION IN BOTH RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL MANAGED ACCOUNTS. NWQ

SPECIALIZES IN VALUE-ORIENTED EQUITY INVESTMENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS

AMONG INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS SERVING HIGH-NET-WORTH INVESTORS.

IN JULY 2001, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED

SYMPHONY ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (SYMPHONY), AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT

MANAGER, WITH APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT THE TIME

OF ACQUISITION. AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS PRODUCT

OFFERINGS WERE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND FUNDS DESIGNED TO

REDUCE RISK THROUGH MARKET-NEUTRAL AND OTHER STRATEGIES IN SEVERAL EQUITY AND

FIXED-INCOME ASSET CLASSES FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS.

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS HAS THREE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF

REVENUE: ADVISORY FEES ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SEPARATELY MANAGED

ACCOUNTS, CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS AND MUTUAL FUNDS; UNDERWRITING AND

DISTRIBUTION REVENUES EARNED UPON THE SALE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENT PRODUCTS; AND

PERFORMANCE FEES EARNED ON CERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE

PERFORMANCE OF SUCH ACCOUNTS.

ADVISORY REVENUE ACCOUNTED FOR 90% OF NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2003. TOTAL ADVISORY FEE INCOME EARNED

DURING ANY PERIOD IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSETS MANAGED.

ADVISORY FEE INCOME INCREASES OR DECREASES WITH A RISE OR FALL, RESPECTIVELY,

IN THE LEVEL OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES ARE

RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. WITH RESPECT TO FUNDS, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

RECEIVES FEES BASED EITHER ON EACH FUNDS AVERAGE DAILY NET ASSETS OR ON A

COMBINATION OF THE AVERAGE DAILY NET ASSETS AND GROSS INTEREST INCOME. WITH

RESPECT TO MANAGED ACCOUNTS, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS GENERALLY EARNS FEES, ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS MANAGED ON A PARTICULAR DATE,

SUCH AS THE LAST CALENDAR DAY OF A QUARTER, OR ON THE AVERAGE ASSET VALUE FOR

THE PERIOD.

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS DISTRIBUTION REVENUES ARE EARNED

AS MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTSARE SOLD

TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH FINANCIAL ADVISORS, AND PRIOR TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2002, THE SALE OF DEFINED PORTFOLIOS. DISTRIBUTION REVENUES WILL RISE AND FALL

COMMENSURATE WITH THE LEVEL OF SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS. IN MARCH 2002,

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS CEASED OFFERING DEFINED PORTFOLIO PRODUCTS. UNDERWRITING

FEES ARE EARNED ON THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS.

THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARY, SYMPHONY, WHICH MANAGES EQUITY

AND FIXED-INCOME MARKET-NEUTRAL ACCOUNTS AND FUNDS FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS,

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS EARNS PERFORMANCE FEES FOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE ABOVE

SPECIFICALLY DEFINED BENCHMARKS. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE ONLY AT

THE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT DATE CONTAINED IN THE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

AGREEMENT. CURRENTLY, APPROXIMATELY 80% OF SUCH MEASUREMENT DATES FALL IN THE

SECOND HALF OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.

WE CONSOLIDATE 100% OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, WITH REDUCTIONS ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND

STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS PROPORTIONATE INTEREST

IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS EQUITY AND EARNINGS. MINORITY INTEREST OF $96 MILLION

AND $80 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY.

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 1.7 MILLION AND 5.7 MILLION OF ITS COMMON SHARES FROM

MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS IN 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, FOR A TOTAL COST OF $42

MILLION IN 2003 AND $151 MILLION IN 2002. NO SHARES WERE REPURCHASED FROM THE

ST. PAUL IN THOSE YEARS. OUR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP REMAINED AT 79% IN 2003 AS

THE EFFECT OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS REPURCHASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NUVEEN

123

INVESTMENTS

ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER VARIOUS STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS

AND, IN 2002, THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON SHARES UPON THE CONVERSION OF A PORTION OF

ITS PREFERRED STOCK.

ACCOUNTING FOR OUR

INVESTMENTS

FIXED

INCOME



OUR

FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO IS COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF HIGH-QUALITY, INTERMEDIATE-TERM

TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, CORPORATE AND MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS, AND TAX-EXEMPT

U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS. OUR ENTIRE FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS

CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. ACCORDINGLY, WE CARRY THAT PORTFOLIO ON OUR

BALANCE SHEET AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET

PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE, FROM A THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICE. IF QUOTED MARKET

PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED USING VALUES OBTAINED FROM

INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES OR A CASH FLOW ESTIMATE IS USED.

REAL

ESTATE AND MORTGAGE LOANS



OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE WAREHOUSES AND OFFICE

BUILDINGS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL LAND AND PROPERTIES THAT WE OWN DIRECTLY OR IN

WHICH WE HAVE A PARTIAL INTEREST THROUGH JOINT VENTURES WITH OTHER INVESTORS. OUR

MORTGAGE LOAN INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF FIXED-RATE LOANS COLLATERALIZED BY

APARTMENT, WAREHOUSE AND OFFICE PROPERTIES.

FOR DIRECT REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS, WE CARRY LAND AT

COST AND BUILDINGS AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS. WE DEPRECIATE REAL ESTATE ASSETS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 40

YEARS. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE CORRESPONDING

LEASE. THE ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION OF OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS WAS $189

MILLION AND $169 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

WE USE THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OUR REAL

ESTATE JOINT VENTURES, WHICH MEANS WE CARRY THESE INVESTMENTS AT COST, ADJUSTED

FOR OUR SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OR LOSSES, AND REDUCED BY CASH

DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE JOINT VENTURES AND VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS. DUE TO TIME

CONSTRAINTS IN OBTAINING FINANCIAL RESULTS, THE RESULTS OF THESE JOINT VENTURE

OPERATIONS ARE RECORDED ON A ONE-MONTH LAG. IF EVENTS OCCUR DURING THE LAG

PERIOD THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS, THE IMPACT IS INCLUDED

IN THE CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS.

WE CARRY OUR MORTGAGE LOANS AT THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCES

LESS ANY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. VALUATION

ALLOWANCES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR LOANS WITH DETERIORATION IN COLLATERAL

PERFORMANCE THAT IS DEEMED OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

MORTGAGE LOANS WAS $63 MILLION AND $82 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

2002, RESPECTIVELY.

VENTURE

CAPITAL



OUR

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS REPRESENT OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN SMALL- TO

MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE THROUGH LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS

OR DIRECT OWNERSHIP. THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS ARE CARRIED AT OUR EQUITY IN THE

ESTIMATED MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS HELD BY THESE LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS.

THE INVESTMENTS WE OWN DIRECTLY ARE CARRIED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. FAIR

VALUES ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTY PRICING

SERVICES FOR PUBLICLY TRADED STOCK, OR AN ESTIMATE OF VALUE AS DETERMINED BY AN

INTERNAL VALUATION COMMITTEE FOR PRIVATELY-HELD SECURITIES. DUE TO TIME

CONSTRAINTS IN OBTAINING FINANCIAL RESULTS, THE OPERATIONS OF THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS

ARE RECORDED ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG. IF SECURITY-SPECIFIC EVENTS OCCUR DURING THE

LAG PERIOD THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS, THE IMPACT IS

INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS.

EQUITIES



OUR EQUITY SECURITIES ARE ALSO CLASSIFIED

AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND CARRIED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS BASED ON

QUOTED MARKET PRICES OBTAINED FROM A THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICE.

SECURITIES

ON LOAN



WE

PARTICIPATE IN A SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM WHEREBY CERTAIN SECURITIES FROM OUR

FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE LOANED TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS. WE REQUIRE COLLATERAL

EQUAL TO 102 PERCENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES. WE MAINTAIN

FULL OWNERSHIP RIGHTS TO THE SECURITIES LOANED, AND CONTINUE TO EARN INTEREST

ON THEM. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELL THE SECURITIES WHILE THEY ARE

ON LOAN. WE HAVE AN INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT WITH THE LENDING AGENTS IN THE

EVENT A BORROWER BECOMES INSOLVENT OR FAILS TO RETURN SECURITIES. WE RECORD

SECURITIES LENDING COLLATERAL AS A LIABILITY AND PAY THE

124

BORROWER AN AGREED UPON

INTEREST RATE. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE COLLATERAL ARE INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS AND ARE REPORTED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. WE SHARE A PORTION OF THE

INTEREST EARNED ON THESE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH THE LENDING AGENT. THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE SECURITIES ON LOAN IS REMOVED FROM FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ON THE

BALANCE SHEET AND SHOWN AS A SEPARATE INVESTMENT ASSET.

REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES



WE RECORD THE COST OF EACH INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT SO THAT

WHEN WE SELL AN INVESTMENT, WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND RECORD THAT TRANSACTIONS

GAIN OR LOSS ON OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.

THE SIZE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ALLOWS OUR

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS A DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY IN DETERMINING WHICH INDIVIDUAL

INVESTMENTS SHOULD BE SOLD TO ACHIEVE OUR PRIMARY INVESTMENT GOALS OF ASSURING

OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER CREDITORS AND

MAXIMIZING OUR INVESTMENT RETURNS. IN ORDER TO MEET THE OBJECTIVE OF

MAINTAINING A FLEXIBLE PORTFOLIO THAT CAN ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, OUR FIXED INCOME

AND EQUITY PORTFOLIOS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. WE CONTINUALLY

EVALUATE THESE PORTFOLIOS, AND OUR PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS ARE BASED

ON OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AND

CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. WE ALSO MONITOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST AND

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS, WHICH INVOLVES UNCERTAINTY AS TO

WHETHER DECLINES IN VALUE ARE TEMPORARY IN NATURE. AT THE TIME WE DETERMINE AN OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IN THE VALUE OF A PARTICULAR INVESTMENT TO HAVE

OCCURRED, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE

FINANCIAL POSITION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF THE ENTITY THAT ISSUED THE

INVESTMENT SECURITY, AND MAKE A DECISION TO EITHER RECORD A WRITE-DOWN IN THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE SECURITY OR SELL THE SECURITY; IN EITHER CASE,

RECOGNIZING A REALIZED LOSS.

WITH RESPECT TO OUR VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO, WE

MANAGE OUR PORTFOLIO TO MAXIMIZE RETURN, EVALUATING CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS

AND THE FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR THE ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE INVESTED. BECAUSE THIS

PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF PRIVATELY-HELD, EARLY-STAGE VENTURE

INVESTMENTS, EVENTS GIVING RISE TO IMPAIRMENT CAN OCCUR IN A BRIEF PERIOD OF

TIME (E.G., THE ENTITY HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN SECURING ADDITIONAL FINANCING,

OTHER INVESTORS DECIDE TO WITHDRAW THEIR SUPPORT, COMPLICATIONS ARISE IN THE

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, ETC.), AND DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THAT POINT IN

TIME, BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WITH RESPECT TO A

RECOGNITION OF OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, OR SALE OF THE INVESTMENT.

UNREALIZED

APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ON INVESTMENTS



FOR INVESTMENTS WE CARRY AT ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE, WE RECORD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COST AND FAIR VALUE, NET OF DEFERRED

TAXES, AS A PART OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THIS DIFFERENCE IS REFERRED TO

AS UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION ON INVESTMENTS. THE CHANGE IN

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION DURING THE YEAR IS A COMPONENT OF OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



WE

RECORD ALL DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.

THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THE GAIN OR LOSS DUE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE QUALIFIES AS A

HEDGE. IF THE DERIVATIVE DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A HEDGE, THE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE

INCLUDED IN OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AS A REALIZED GAIN OR LOSSWHEN THEY OCCUR. IF THE DERIVATIVE

QUALIFIES AS A HEDGE, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF RISK

BEING HEDGED. GENERALLY, HOWEVER, THE PORTION OF THE HEDGE DEEMED EFFECTIVE IS

RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE, AND THE PORTION DEEMED INEFFECTIVE

IS RECORDED IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AS A REALIZED GAIN OR LOSS. TO QUALIFY

FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP IS FORMALLY DOCUMENTED

AT THE INCEPTION OF THE HEDGE DETAILING THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND

STRATEGY FOR UNDERTAKING THE HEDGE. IN ADDITION, WE ASSESS BOTH AT THE

INCEPTION OF THE HEDGE AND ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE IS

HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN ACCOMPLISHING THE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES. IF IT IS

DETERMINED THAT THE DERIVATIVE IS NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT IS DISCONTINUED AND ANY GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEDGES

INEFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED AS A REALIZED GAIN OR LOSS IN THE

125

STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. FAIR

VALUE FOR OUR DERIVATIVES IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET RATES OR MODELS OBTAINED

FROM THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES.

SEE NOTE 7 FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING THE TYPES OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE

HOLD.

CASH RESTRICTIONS

LLOYDS SOLVENCY

REQUIREMENTS CALL FOR CERTAIN OF OUR FUNDS TO BE HELD IN TRUST IN AMOUNTS

SUFFICIENT TO MEET CLAIMS. THESE FUNDS AMOUNTED TO $30 MILLION AND $167 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002, WE ADOPTED THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (SFAS NO. 141)

AND SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, (SFAS NO. 142).

IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION, THE EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT WE PAID OVER THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANYS TANGIBLE NET ASSETS IS RECORDED AS EITHER AN

INTANGIBLE ASSET, IF IT MEETS CERTAIN CRITERIA, OR GOODWILL. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WITH A FINITE USEFUL LIFE (GENERALLY OVER FOUR TO 20 YEARS) ARE AMORTIZED TO

EXPENSE OVER THEIR ESTIMATED LIFE, ON A BASIS EXPECTED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH

THEIR ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE USEFUL

LIFE AND GOODWILL, WHICH REPRESENTS THE EXCESS PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR

VALUE OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ARE NO LONGER AMORTIZED, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2002, BUT REMAIN SUBJECT TO TESTS FOR IMPAIRMENT. PRIOR TO OUR ADOPTION OF SFAS

NOS. 141 AND 142, WE AMORTIZED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER PERIODS OF

UP TO 40 YEARS, GENERALLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. SEE NOTE 22 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED HEREIN FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

REGARDING GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET.

WE EVALUATE OUR GOODWILL

FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE

THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW

ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, WE WILL TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS.

IMPAIRMENTS OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE MONITOR THE

RECOVERABILITY OF THE VALUE OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED BASED

ON OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS (UNDISCOUNTED AND WITHOUT INTEREST

CHARGES) EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL

DISPOSITION CONSIDERING ANY EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH INDICATE

THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE MONITOR THE

VALUE OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF AND REPORT THEM AT THE LOWER

OF CARRYING VALUE OR FAIR VALUE LESS OUR ESTIMATED COST TO SELL. WE HAD NO

IMPAIRMENT ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN 2003, 2002 OR 2001.

OFFICE PROPERTIES

AND EQUIPMENT

WE CARRY OFFICE PROPERTIES

AND EQUIPMENT AT DEPRECIATED COST. WE DEPRECIATE THESE ASSETS ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE

ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION FOR OFFICE PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT WAS $517 MILLION

AND $504 MILLION AT THE END OF 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

INTERNALLY

DEVELOPED SOFTWARE COSTS

WE CAPITALIZE CERTAIN INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE

COSTS INCURRED DURING THE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT STAGE OF A PROJECT. THESE

COSTS INCLUDE EXTERNAL DIRECT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT AND PAYROLL AND

RELATED COSTS FOR EMPLOYEES WHO DEVOTE TIME TO THE PROJECT. WE BEGIN TO

AMORTIZE COSTS ONCE THE SOFTWARE IS READY FOR ITS INTENDED USE, AND AMORTIZE

THEM OVER THE SOFTWARES EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE, GENERALLY FIVE YEARS.

126

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003

AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, WE HAD $73 MILLION AND $69 MILLION OF UNAMORTIZED

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED COMPUTER SOFTWARECOSTS.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001, WE RECORDED $18

MILLION, $13 MILLION AND $7 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, RESPECTIVELY.

TAXES

WE ACCOUNT FOR INCOME

TAXES UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND INCOME

TAX REPORTING BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON ENACTED TAX RATES AND

LAWS. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT GENERALLY REFLECTS THE NET

CHANGE IN DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DURING THE YEAR. THE

CURRENT INCOME TAX PROVISION GENERALLY REFLECTS THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF

REVENUES AND EXPENSES CURRENTLY TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE ON INCOME TAX RETURNS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION

WE ASSIGN FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES TO OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY THE CURRENCIES OF THE

LOCAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED TO THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, AND THE RESULTING FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE

REFLECTED IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS ARE THEN

TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS FROM THIS

TRANSLATION, NET OF TAX, IS RECORDED AS A PART OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE

CHANGE IN UNREALIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION GAIN OR LOSS DURING THE YEAR,

NET OF TAX, IS A COMPONENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. BOTH THE REMEASUREMENT AND

TRANSLATION ARE CALCULATED USING CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE BALANCE SHEETS

AND AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

STOCK OPTION

ACCOUNTING

WE FOLLOW THE PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BOARD OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES (APB 25),

FASB INTERPRETATION 44, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING STOCK

COMPENSATION (AN INTERPRETATION OF APB OPINION NO. 25), AND OTHER RELATED

INTERPRETATIONS IN ACCOUNTING FOR OUR STOCK OPTION PLANS UTILIZING THE INTRINSIC

VALUE METHOD DESCRIBED IN THAT LITERATURE. WE ALSO FOLLOW THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS

OF SFAS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FOR OUR OPTION

PLANS, AS AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 148, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE; AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 123.

THESE REQUIRE PRO FORMA NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE INFORMATION, WHICH IS

CALCULATED ASSUMING WE HAD ACCOUNTED FOR OUR STOCK OPTION PLANS UNDER THE FAIR

VALUE METHOD DESCRIBED IN THOSE STATEMENTS.

127

HAD WE

CALCULATED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON A COMBINED BASIS FOR OUR STOCK OPTION GRANTS

BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE METHOD DESCRIBED IN SFAS NO. 123, OUR NET INCOME

AND EARNINGS PER SHARE WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO THE PRO FORMA AMOUNTS AS

INDICATED.

2   MERGER

AGREEMENT WITH THE TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP.

ON NOVEMBER 17, 2003, THE ST. PAUL AND TRAVELERS

PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TRAVELERS) ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE

MERGER AGREEMENT THAT WILL CREATE THE ST. PAUL TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (ST.

PAUL TRAVELERS), WHICH WOULD BE THE NATIONS SECOND LARGEST PROPERTY-CASUALTY

INSURER BASED ON 2002 A.M. BEST DATA CONCERNING DIRECT PREMIUMS WRITTEN. THE

MERGER AGREEMENT IS FILED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THIS REPORT. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OF EACH COMPANY UNANIMOUSLY AGREED TO THE TAX-FREE, STOCK-FOR-STOCK MERGER (THE

PROPOSED MERGER OR THE MERGER). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT,

TECHNICAL EVENT OF DEFAULT, CONTINGENT UPON THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER.

3   SEGMENT

INFORMATION

IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2003, WE REVISED OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE BUSINESS SEGMENT

REPORTING STRUCTURE TO REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE BUSINESSES ARE MANAGED.

OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS CONSIST OF TWO SEGMENTS

CONSTITUTING OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS (

SPECIALTY

COMMERCIAL

AND

COMMERCIAL LINES

),

AND ONE SEGMENT COMPRISING OUR RUNOFF OPERATIONS

(OTHER)

. THE COMPOSITION OF THOSE RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS IS

DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL BELOW. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF CHANGES MADE

TO OUR SEGMENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003.

·

OUR

SURETY & CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TOGETHER AS A

SEPARATE SPECIALTY SEGMENT, ARE NOW SEPARATE COMPONENTS OF OUR

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

SEGMENT.

·

OUR

ONGOING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS,

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TOGETHER AS A SEPARATE SPECIALTY SEGMENT, ARE NOW SEPARATE

COMPONENTS OF OUR

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

SEGMENT.

·

OUR

HEALTH CARE, REINSURANCE AND OTHER OPERATIONS, EACH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS A

SEPARATE RUNOFF BUSINESS SEGMENT, HAVE BEEN COMBINED INTO A SINGLE

OTHER

RUNOFF SEGMENT AND ARE UNDER COMMON

MANAGEMENT. RUNOFF MEANS THAT WE HAVE CEASED OR PLAN TO CEASE UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

·

THE

RESULTS OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS, AS WELL AS LOSS

DEVELOPMENT ON BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN PRIOR TO 1980 (PRIOR TO 1988 FOR BUSINESS

ACQUIRED IN OUR MERGER WITH USF&G CORPORATION IN 1998), PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED

IN OUR

COMMERCIAL LINES

SEGMENT,

ARE NOW INCLUDED IN THE

OTHER

SEGMENT.

IN ADDITION TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS, THIS PRIOR YEAR

BUSINESS INCLUDED THE MAJORITY OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS LIABILITY

EXPOSURES. THE OVERSIGHT

129

OF THESE EXPOSURES IS THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SAME MANAGEMENT TEAM RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF THE

OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE

OTHER

SEGMENT.

IN ADDITION, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, OUR

SPECIALTY PROGRAMS

BUSINESS CENTER,

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN OUR SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, WAS MOVED TO OUR

COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS

BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN AND MANAGED. ALL DATA FOR 2002 AND 2001 INCLUDED IN

THIS REPORT WERE RESTATED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES MADE TO OUR SEGMENT

REPORTING STRUCTURE IN 2003.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 131, DISCLOSURES

ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, SINCE SURETY &

CONSTRUCTION, INTERNATIONAL & LLOYDS, HEALTH CARE, AND REINSURANCE

WERE REPORTED AS SEPARATE SEGMENTS DURING 2002 AND ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OF

CONTINUING SIGNIFICANCE IN ANALYZING THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS, WE CONTINUE

TO SEPARATELY PRESENT AND DISCUSS (AS APPROPRIATE) IN THIS REPORT INFORMATION

ABOUT THOSE BUSINESSES FOR ALL YEARS COVERED BY THIS REPORT.

OUR OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF DO NOT QUALIFY AS DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003,

THESE RUNOFF OPERATIONS COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTED FOR $327 MILLION, OR 5%, OF OUR

NET EARNED PREMIUMS, AND GENERATED UNDERWRITING LOSSES TOTALING $762 MILLION

(AN AMOUNT THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE ASSETS MAINTAINED

TO SUPPORT THESE OPERATIONS). FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, THESE

RUNOFF OPERATIONS COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTED FOR $1.98 BILLION, OR 26%, OF OUR NET

EARNED PREMIUMS, AND GENERATED UNDERWRITING LOSSES TOTALING $874 MILLION, AN

AMOUNT THAT INCLUDED A $585 MILLION PRETAX LOSS PROVISION RELATED TO THE

WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2001, THESE RUNOFF OPERATIONS COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTED FOR $2.97 BILLION, OR 40%,

OF OUR NET EARNED PREMIUMS, AND GENERATED UNDERWRITING LOSSES TOTALING $1.87

BILLION, AN AMOUNT THAT INCLUDED A $735 MILLION PRETAX LOSS PROVISION TO

STRENGTHEN PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES IN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION AND $662

MILLION OF PRETAX LOSSES RELATED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST

ATTACK.

IN ADDITION TO OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY BUSINESS

SEGMENT, WE ALSO HAVE APROPERTY-LIABILITY

INVESTMENT OPERATION SEGMENT, AS WELL AS AN ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENT, CONSISTING

OF OUR MAJORITY OWNERSHIP IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS.

THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME

AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1

OF THIS REPORT. WE EVALUATE PERFORMANCE BASED ON UNDERWRITING RESULTS FOR OUR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE SEGMENTS, INVESTMENT INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS FOR

OUR INVESTMENT OPERATIONS, AND ON PRETAX OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE ASSET

MANAGEMENT SEGMENT. PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED IN

TOTAL BY MANAGEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF DECISION-MAKING. WE DO NOT ALLOCATE ASSETS

TO THESE SPECIFIC UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS. ASSETS ARE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED FOR

OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT SEGMENT.

SEGMENT

INFORMATION



AFTER

THE REVISIONS TO OUR SEGMENT STRUCTURE DESCRIBED ABOVE, OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

IN OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONS CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.

THE SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT INCLUDES OUR

SURETY

AND

CONSTRUCTION

OPERATIONS, OUR ONGOING

INTERNATIONAL & LLOYDS

OPERATIONS, AND THE

FOLLOWING NINE SPECIALTY BUSINESS CENTERS THAT IN TOTAL COMPRISE THE SPECIALTY

COMPONENT OF THIS SEGMENT.

TECHNOLOGY,

FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, MARINE, PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK, PUBLIC

SECTOR SERVICES, DISCOVER RE, UMBRELLA/EXCESS & SURPLUS LINES, EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES UNDERWRITING

FACILITIES

AND

OIL &

GAS.

THESE BUSINESS CENTERS ARE CONSIDERED SPECIALTY OPERATIONS

BECAUSE EACH PROVIDES DEDICATED UNDERWRITING, CLAIM AND RISK CONTROL SERVICES

THAT REQUIRE SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE AND FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON THE RESPECTIVE

CUSTOMERS IT SERVES. OUR

SURETY

BUSINESS CENTER UNDERWRITES SURETY

BONDS, WHICH ARE AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH ONE PARTY (THE SURETY) GUARANTEES TO

ANOTHER PARTY (THE OWNER OR OBLIGEE) THAT A THIRD PARTY (THE CONTRACTOR OR

PRINCIPAL) WILL PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL OR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. THE

CONSTRUCTION

BUSINESS CENTER

OFFERS A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL INSURANCE

CONSISTING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION, GENERAL LIABILITY

130

AND

COMMERCIAL AUTO COVERAGES, AND RISK MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, TO A BROAD RANGE OF

CONTRACTORS AND PARTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.

OUR

ONGOING

INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS

CONSIST OF OUR SPECIALTY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA

(OTHER THAN SURETY) AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, AND THE INTERNATIONAL

EXPOSURES OF MOST U.S. UNDERWRITING BUSINESS. AT

LLOYDS,

OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS ARE COMPRISED OF THE

FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE COVERAGE WE UNDERWRITE MOSTLY THROUGH A SINGLE

WHOLLY-OWNED SYNDICATE: AVIATION, MARINE, GLOBAL PROPERTY AND PERSONAL LINES.

THE

COMMERCIAL LINES

SEGMENT FOCUSES ON

COMMERCIAL CLIENTELE, AND ALTHOUGH WE TARGETCERTAIN

COMMERCIAL CUSTOMER GROUPS AND INDUSTRIES, WE DO NOT HAVE UNDERWRITING, CLAIM

OR RISK SERVICE PERSONNEL WITH SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE DEDICATED EXCLUSIVELY TO

THESE GROUPS OR INDUSTRIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE BUSINESS CENTERS WITHIN COMMERCIAL

LINES ARE NOT CONSIDERED SPECIALTY BUSINESSES. THE COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT INCLUDES OUR

SMALL COMMERCIAL

,

MIDDLE

MARKET COMMERCIAL

AND

PROPERTY

SOLUTIONS

BUSINESS CENTERS, AS WELL AS THE RESULTS OF OUR LIMITED

INVOLVEMENT IN INVOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS. THE

SMALL COMMERCIAL

BUSINESS CENTER SERVICES COMMERCIAL FIRMS

THAT TYPICALLY HAVE BETWEEN ONE AND FIFTY EMPLOYEES THROUGH ITS PROPRIETARY ST.

PAUL MAINSTREET

(SM)

AND ST. PAUL ADVANTAGE

(SM)

PRODUCTS, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON OFFICES, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS, ARTISAN

CONTRACTORS AND OTHER SERVICE RISKS. THE

MIDDLE

MARKET COMMERCIAL

BUSINESS CENTER OFFERS COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE

COVERAGES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF MANUFACTURING, WHOLESALE, SERVICE AND RETAIL

EXPOSURES, AS WELL AS PROGRAMS FOR SELECTED INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NATIONAL IN

SCOPE AND HAVE SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS FRANCHISES AND ASSOCIATIONS.

THE MAJORITY OF THESE PROGRAMS WERE FORMERLY CLASSIFIED AS A SEPARATE SPECIALTY

PROGRAMS BUSINESS CENTER IN OUR SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT BUT WERE

RECLASSIFIED IN 2003 TO OUR

MIDDLE MARKET

COMMERCIAL

BUSINESS CENTER IN THE COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT TO MORE

ACCURATELY REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN AND

MANAGED. THIS BUSINESS CENTER ALSO OFFERS LOSS-SENSITIVE CASUALTY PROGRAMS,

INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DEDUCTIBLE AND SELF-INSURED RETENTION OPTIONS, FOR THE

HIGHER END OF THE MIDDLE MARKET SECTOR. THE

PROPERTY

SOLUTIONS

BUSINESS CENTER COMBINES OUR LARGE ACCOUNTS PROPERTY

BUSINESS WITH THE COMMERCIAL PORTION OF OUR CATASTROPHE RISK BUSINESS AND

ALLOWS US TO TAKE A UNIFIED APPROACH TO LARGE PROPERTY RISKS.

THE

OTHER

SEGMENT INCLUDES THE RESULTS OF THE

LINES OF BUSINESS WE PLACED IN RUNOFF IN LATE 2001 AND EARLY 2002, INCLUDING

OUR FORMER HEALTH CARE AND REINSURANCE SEGMENTS, AND THE RESULTS OF THE

FOLLOWING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS: OUR RUNOFF OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, INCLUDING

OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE INSURING OF THE LLOYDS CENTRAL FUND; UNIONAMERICA,

THE LONDON-BASED UNDERWRITING UNIT ACQUIRED AS PART OF OUR PURCHASE OF MMI IN

2000; AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS WE DECIDED TO EXIT AT THE END OF 2001. THIS

SEGMENT ALSO INCLUDES THE RESULTS OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY INSURANCE

POOLS, AS WELL AS LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN PRIOR TO 1980

(PRIOR TO 1988 FOR BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN OUR MERGER WITH USF&G CORPORATION

IN 1998). IN ADDITION TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY INSURANCE POOLS, THIS

PRIOR YEAR BUSINESS INCLUDES THE MAJORITY OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS

LIABILITY EXPOSURES. OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION HISTORICALLY PROVIDED A WIDE

RANGE OF MEDICAL LIABILITY INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE

ENTIRE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. OUR REINSURANCE OPERATIONS HISTORICALLY

ELIMINATION OF ONE-QUARTER

IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, WE ELIMINATED THE ONE-QUARTER REPORTING LAG FOR OUR

UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS TO COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF REPORTING FOR

ALL OF OUR OTHER INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, OUR CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS FOR 2003 INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF THOSE OPERATIONS FOR THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2002 AND ALL QUARTERS OF 2003. THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT ON OUR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONS OF ELIMINATING THE REPORTING LAG, CONSISTING OF

THE RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

RECLASSIFICATION OF

LLOYDS COMMISSION EXPENSES



IN 2003, WE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN COMMISSION EXPENSES

RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS. IN PRIOR YEARS, WE DETERMINED COMMISSION

EXPENSE BASED ON PREMIUMS REPORTED BY THE LLOYDS MARKET (NET OF COMMISSIONS)

USING AN ESTIMATED AVERAGE COMMISSION RATE. UNTIL RECENTLY, GROSS PREMIUMS

(PRIOR TO REDUCTION FOR COMMISSIONS) WERE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM THE LLOYDS

MARKET. IN 2003, WE BEGAN RECORDING ACTUAL COMMISSION EXPENSE FOR OUR LLOYDS

BUSINESS. WE RECLASSIFIED PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS TO RECORD ACTUAL COMMISSION

EXPENSE ON A BASIS CONSISTENT WITH THAT IMPLEMENTED IN 2003. THERE WAS NO

IMPACT TO NET INCOME OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FOR ANY

PRIOR PERIODS, BECAUSE THE RECLASSIFICATION HAD THE IMPACT OF INCREASING

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PREMIUMS AND COMMISSION EXPENSE IN EQUAL AND OFFSETTING

AMOUNTS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, THIS RECLASSIFICATION HAD

THE IMPACT OF INCREASING BOTH NET EARNED PREMIUMS AND POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

BY $81 MILLION COMPARED WITH WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED UNDER OUR PRIOR

METHOD OF ESTIMATION. IN ADDITION, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED BY $116

MILLION IN 2003, (A PORTION OF WHICH WAS DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE

ONE-QUARTER REPORTING LAG). FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE

IMPACT WAS AN INCREASE TO BOTH NET EARNED PREMIUMS AND POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

OF $112 MILLION AND AN INCREASE TO NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $91 MILLION. FOR THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE IMPACT WAS AN INCREASE TO BOTH NET

EARNED PREMIUMS AND POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS OF $112 MILLION AND AN INCREASE TO

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $132 MILLION.

WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST

AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS, WHICH INVOLVES UNCERTAINTY AS TO

WHETHER DECLINES IN VALUE ARE TEMPORARY IN NATURE. IF WE BELIEVE A DECLINE IN

THE VALUE OF A PARTICULAR INVESTMENT IS TEMPORARY, WE RECORD THE DECLINE AS AN

UNREALIZED LOSS IN OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IF WE BELIEVE THE DECLINE

IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, WE WRITE DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT

AND RECORD A REALIZED LOSS ON OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. OUR ASSESSMENT OF A

DECLINE IN VALUE INCLUDES OUR CURRENT JUDGMENT AS TO THE FINANCIAL POSITION AND

FUTURE PROSPECTS OF THE ENTITY THAT ISSUED THE INVESTMENT SECURITY. IF THAT

JUDGMENT CHANGES IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECORD A REALIZED LOSS AFTER

HAVING ORIGINALLY CONCLUDED THAT THE DECLINE IN VALUE WAS TEMPORARY.

137

AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED INVESTED ASSET PORTFOLIO

INCLUDED $0.95 BILLION AND $1.03 BILLION OF NET PRETAX UNREALIZED APPRECIATION,

RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THOSE NET AMOUNTS WERE GROSS PRETAX UNREALIZED LOSSES

OF $129 MILLION AND $208 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE,

FOR ALL SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

2002, THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE AND GROSS UNREALIZED LOSS BY LENGTH OF TIME

THOSE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION. THE

COST OF THESE INVESTMENTS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 16% OF OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO (AT COST) AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE MAJORITY OF UNREALIZED

LOSSES RELATED TO FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE ISSUER-SPECIFIC RATHER THAN

INTEREST RATE-RELATED.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE FUTURES,

FORWARD, SWAP AND OPTION CONTRACTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR

CHARACTERISTICS. WE HAVE HAD LIMITED INVOLVEMENT WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS,

PRIMARILY FOR PURPOSES OF HEDGING AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. ALL INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENT TECHNIQUES AND

RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, HAVE

SOME DEGREE OF MARKET AND CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. WE BELIEVE OUR

DERIVATIVES MARKET RISK SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSETS THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND MARKET

PRICES. WE SEEK TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE BY CONDUCTING DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH REPUTABLE, INVESTMENT-GRADE COUNTERPARTIES, AND BY

SEEKING TO AVOID CONCENTRATIONS OF EXPOSURE INDIVIDUALLY OR WITH RELATED

PARTIES.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2001, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS

OF SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED (SFAS NO. 133). THE STATEMENT REQUIRES THE

RECOGNITION OF ALL DERIVATIVES AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE

SHEET, CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATEMENT, DERIVATIVES ARE

SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED INTO ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES BASED ON THEIR INTENDED

USE, AND THE APPLICABLE CATEGORY DICTATES THE ACCOUNTING FOR EACH DERIVATIVE.

WE HAVE HELD THE FOLLOWING DERIVATIVES, BY CATEGORY.

FAIR

VALUE HEDGES



FOR

THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001, WE HAVE SEVERAL PAY-FLOATING,

RECEIVE-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS TOTALING $730 MILLION,

$730 MILLION AND $230 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THEY ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE

HEDGES FOR A PORTION OF OUR MEDIUM-TERM AND SENIOR NOTES, WHICH WE HAVE ENTERED

INTO FOR THE PURPOSE OF MANAGING THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON

THIS DEBT. THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS, AND THE

SWAPS ARE THEREFORE CONSIDERED 100% EFFECTIVE. THE BALANCE SHEET IMPACT FOR

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, WAS A DECREASE OF $19 MILLION IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE SWAPS AND THE RELATED DEBT ON THE BALANCE SHEET, WITH THE STATEMENT OF

OPERATIONS IMPACTS OFFSETTING. THE IMPACT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002

AND 2001 FROM MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES WERE INCREASES OF $42 MILLION AND $8

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAPS AND THE RELATED DEBT ON

THE BALANCE SHEET, WITH THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IMPACTS OFFSETTING.

IN 2003, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF

INTEREST RATE SWAP TRANSACTIONS AS HEDGES AGAINST CHANGES IN A PORTION OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF PRIVATE PLACEMENT DEBT. ALL OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP

TRANSACTIONS WERE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES TO MITIGATE THE CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED PORTION OF THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT DEBT. CERTAIN OF

THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP TRANSACTIONS WERE TERMINATED. THE CANCELLATION OF

THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP TRANSACTIONS RESULTED IN A TOTAL GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY

$4 MILLION, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT

DEBT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE REMAINING OPEN INTEREST RATE SWAP TRANSACTION

HAD A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $50 MILLION AND HAD A FAIR VALUE OF LESS THAN

$100,000.

CASH

FLOW HEDGES



WE

HAVE PURCHASED FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH

FLOW HEDGES. THEY ARE UTILIZED TO MINIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES FROM OUR EXPECTED FOREIGN CURRENCY PAYMENTS, AND

SETTLEMENT OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY PAYABLES AND RECEIVABLES. FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002 WE RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $4 MILLION AND A GAIN

OF $1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE CASH FLOW HEDGES, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI). THE

141

COMPARABLE AMOUNT FOR THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 WAS A $2 MILLION LOSS. THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OCI

WILL BE REALIZED INTO EARNINGS CONCURRENT WITH THE TIMING OF THE HEDGED CASH

FLOWS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION WILL BE

RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 WE RECOGNIZED A GAIN OF LESS THAN $1 MILLION,

NEITHER A GAIN NOR A LOSS, AND A LOSS OF LESS THAN $1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN

THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS REPRESENTING THE PORTION OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS

DEEMED INEFFECTIVE.

IN 2003, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, IN ANTICIPATION OF THE

PRIVATE PLACEMENT DEBT ISSUANCE, ENTERED INTO TWO TREASURY RATE LOCK TRANSACTIONS

WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $100 MILLION. THESE TREASURY RATE LOCKS

WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES. THE TREASURY RATE LOCKS WERE SETTLED FOR

$1 MILLION. WE HAVE DEFERRED THIS LOSS IN OCI AS THE TREASURY RATE LOCKS WERE

CONSIDERED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN ELIMINATING THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON THE

FORECASTED DEBT ISSUANCE. AMOUNTS ACCUMULATED IN OCI WILL BE RECLASSIFIED INTO

EARNINGS COMMENSURATE WITH THE RECOGNITION OF THE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE NEWLY

ISSUED DEBT.

THE

ACCUMULATED CHANGES IN OCI AS A RESULT OF CASH FLOW HEDGES FOR 2003 (NET OF

TAXES) ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

STOCK WARRANTS IN OUR VENTURE CAPITAL BUSINESS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD

CONTRACTS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 WE RECORDED $7

MILLION, $13 MILLION AND $3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF REALIZED GAINS IN

CONTINUING OPERATIONS RELATED TO THOSE NON-HEDGE DERIVATIVES. INCOME FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS RELATING TO NON-HEDGE DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

SALE OF OUR LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS INCLUDED A LOSS OF $22 MILLION AND A GAIN

OF $17 MILLION FOR THE PERIODS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

IN 2003, THE TOTAL OF $646 MILLION IN PROVISIONS FOR

LOSSES AND LAE FOR CLAIMS INCURRED IN PRIOR YEARS INCLUDED $350 MILLION IN OUR

HEALTH CARE OPERATION, $108 IN OUR RUNOFF OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS AND $88 MILLION

IN OUR RUNOFF UNIONAMERICA OPERATION. IN 2002, THE TOTAL OF $999 MILLION IN

PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND LAE FOR CLAIMS INCURRED IN PRIOR YEARS INCLUDED $472

MILLION IN OUR RUNOFF OTHER SEGMENT RELATED TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, $217 MILLION IN OUR SURETY AND CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS IN

OUR SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, $135 MILLION IN OUR RUNOFF OPERATIONS AT

LLOYDS AND $97 MILLION IN OUR RUNOFF HEALTH CARE OPERATION. IN 2001, THE $577

MILLION PROVISION TO INCREASE PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES WAS DRIVEN BY A $735 MILLION

PROVISION RECORDED IN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION.

THE $955 MILLION OF LOSS RESERVES SOLD SHOWN IN THE

TABLE CONSIST OF $944 MILLION OF RESERVES RELATED TO OUR SALE OF CAMPERDOWN UK,

LIMITED, AND $11 MILLION OF RESERVES RELATED TO THE SALE OF OUR INSURANCE

OPERATIONS IN BOTSWANA. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THESE TRANSACTIONS.

HEALTH CARE EXPOSURES.

AT THE END OF

2001, WE ANNOUNCED OUR INTENTION TO EXIT, ON A GLOBAL BASIS, ALL BUSINESS

UNDERWRITTEN IN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATION THROUGH CEASING TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS

AND THE NON-RENEWAL OF BUSINESS UPON POLICY EXPIRATION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN 2001, LOSS ACTIVITY IN THIS OPERATION CONTINUED TO

INCREASE NOT ONLY FOR THE YEARS 1995 THROUGH 1997, BUT ALSO 1998, AND EARLY

ACTIVITY ON CLAIMS INCURRED IN 1999 THROUGH 2001 INDICATED AN INCREASE IN

SEVERITY FOR THOSE YEARS. THOSE FACTORS LED TO A MUCH DIFFERENT VIEW OF LOSS

DEVELOPMENT IN THE HEALTH CARE OPERATION, AND RESULTED IN A $735 MILLION

PROVISION TO INCREASE PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES.

143

DURING 2002, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE IMPACT OF SETTLING

CLAIMS IN A RUNOFF ENVIRONMENT IN OUR HEALTH CARE SEGMENT WAS CAUSING ABNORMAL

EFFECTS ON OUR AVERAGE PAID CLAIMS, AVERAGE OUTSTANDING CLAIMS, AND THE AMOUNT

OF AVERAGE CASE RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR NEW CLAIMSALL OF WHICH ARE

TRADITIONAL STATISTICS USED BY OUR ACTUARIES TO DEVELOP INDICATED RANGES OF

EXPECTED LOSS. TAKING THESE CHANGING STATISTICS INTO ACCOUNT, WE DEVELOPED

VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF OUR DATA, WHICH IMPLIED ADDED UNCERTAINTY IN OUR

EVALUATION OF THESE RESERVES.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, WE ESTABLISHED SPECIFIC

TOOLS AND INDICATORS TO MORE EXPLICITLY MONITOR AND VALIDATE OUR KEY

ASSUMPTIONS SUPPORTING OUR HEALTH CARE RESERVE CONCLUSIONS SINCE OUR

TRADITIONAL STATISTICS AND RESERVING METHODS NEEDED TO BE SUPPLEMENTED IN ORDER

TO PROVIDE A MORE MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS. THE TOOLS THAT WERE DEVELOPED TRACKED

THREE PRIMARY INDICATORS WHICH ARE INFLUENCING OUR EXPECTATIONS AND INCLUDE: A)

NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS, B) RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS AND C) THE

REDUNDANCY RATIO, COMPARING THE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS TO THE RESERVE ESTABLISHED

FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. THESE THREE INDICATORS ARE RELATED SUCH THAT IF

ONE DETERIORATES, ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT ON ANOTHER IS NECESSARY FOR US TO

CONCLUDE THAT FURTHER RESERVE STRENGTHENING IS NOT NECESSARY.

DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF 2003 WE TRACKED

THESE THREE INDICATORS. NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS WERE BETTER THAN EXPECTED,

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS WAS WORSE THAN EXPECTED AND THE REDUNDANCY

RATIO WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED. NOT ONLY WAS THE REDUNDANCY RATIO BETTER THAN

EXPECTED, IT IMPROVED IN EACH OF THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS CONTINUALLY

OFFSETTING ANY ADVERSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS. THE COMBINED IMPACT

OF THESE THREE INDICATORS OFFSET ONE ANOTHER, AND RESERVE LEVELS WERE DEEMED

APPROPRIATE.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF

NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS TOTALED $65 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY 24% BETTER THAN WE

ANTICIPATED IN OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF RESERVES AT

YEAR-END 2002. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF NEWLY REPORTED CLAIMS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS APPROXIMATELY 10% BETTER THAN OUR ORIGINAL EXPECTATION.

WE CONSIDER THE ASSUMPTIONS WE MADE AT THE END OF 2002 FOR NEWLY REPORTED

CLAIMS TO BE APPROPRIATE AND WE HAVE MADE NO CHANGES TO THOSE ASSUMPTIONS. LOSS

DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY

WORSE THAN ANTICIPATED. HOWEVER, THROUGH ALL OF 2003, THE CUMULATIVE

DEVELOPMENT WAS CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN EXPECTED. THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER,

THIS ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT ON KNOWN CLAIMS WAS OFFSET BY CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT ON

THE ACTUAL REDUNDANCY RATIO EXPERIENCED AND NO ADJUSTMENT HAD BEEN NEEDED.

HOWEVER, OUR ACTUAL REDUNDANCY RATIO, WHICH HAD CONTINUALLY IMPROVED DURING THE

FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003, TOOK AN ADVERSE TURN DURING NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, CAUSING

THE REQUIRED RESERVE REDUNDANCY TO INCREASE ABOVE OUR LEVEL OF TOLERANCE. THE

VIEW THAT THE REDUNDANCY RATIO WOULD NOT ONLY FAIL TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE, BUT

COULD LIKELY DECAY OVER TIME, CAUSED US TO RECORD A $350 MILLION INCREASE TO

RESERVE LEVELS. THE NEW REQUIRED REDUNDANCY RATIO AFTER THE $350 MILLION OF

RESERVE STRENGTHENING RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER IS IN THE RANGE OF 30% TO

35% AND ALLOWS FOR FUTURE INFLATIONARY EFFECTS.

THE THREE INDICATORS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE RELATED SUCH

THAT IF ONE DETERIORATES, ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT ON ANOTHER IS NECESSARY FOR US

TO CONCLUDE THAT FURTHER RESERVE STRENGTHENING IS NOT NECESSARY.  THE RESULTS OF THESE INDICATORS SUPPORT OUR

CURRENT VIEW THAT WE HAVE RECORDED A REASONABLE PROVISION FOR OUR MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE EXPOSURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND OUR ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO

SUPPORT OUR BELIEF THAT WE WILL REALIZE FAVORABLE EFFECTS IN OUR ULTIMATE COSTS

AND THAT OUR CURRENT LOSS RESERVES WILL PROVE TO BE A REASONABLE PROVISION.

SURETY

EXPOSURES.

WITHIN OUR SURETY OPERATIONS, WE HAVE

EXPOSURES RELATED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF

BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OTHER ACCOUNTS HAVE EXPERIENCED

DETERIORATION IN CREDITWORTHINESS SINCE WE ISSUED BONDS TO THEM. GIVEN THE

CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND ITS IMPACT ON THESE COMPANIES, WE MAY EXPERIENCE

AN INCREASE IN CLAIMS AND, POSSIBLY, INCUR HIGH SEVERITY LOSSES. SUCH LOSSES

WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CLAIMS ARE FILED AND DETERMINED

TO BE A VALID LOSS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE SURETY BOND ISSUED.

144

WITH REGARD TO COMMERCIAL SURETY BONDS ISSUED ON

BEHALF OF COMPANIES OPERATING IN THE ENERGY TRADING SECTOR, OUR AGGREGATE

PRETAX EXPOSURE, NET OF FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE, IS WITH FIVE COMPANIES FOR A

TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $367 MILLION ($305 MILLION OF WHICH IS FROM GAS SUPPLY

BONDS), AN AMOUNT THAT WILL DECLINE OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS. THE LARGEST

INDIVIDUAL EXPOSURE APPROXIMATES $181 MILLION (PRETAX). THESE COMPANIES ALL

CONTINUE TO PERFORM THEIR BONDED OBLIGATIONS AND, THEREFORE, NO CLAIMS HAVE

BEEN FILED.

IN ADDITION TO THE EXPOSURES DISCUSSED ABOVE WITH

RESPECT TO ENERGY TRADING COMPANIES AND COMPANIES IN BANKRUPTCY, OUR COMMERCIAL

SURETY BUSINESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 INCLUDED SEVEN ACCOUNTS WITH GROSS

PRETAX BOND EXPOSURES GREATER THAN $100 MILLION EACH, BEFORE REINSURANCE. THE

MAJORITY OF THESE ACCOUNTS HAVE INVESTMENT GRADE RATINGS, AND ALL ACCOUNTS

CONTINUE TO PERFORM THEIR BONDED OBLIGATIONS.

IN 2003, WE RECORDED A $59 MILLION PRETAX LOSS

PROVISION (NET OF REINSURANCE) RELATED TO ONE OF OUR ACCOUNTS THAT WAS IN

BANKRUPTCY AND UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS BONDED OBLIGATIONS. IN APRIL 2003, A

BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVED THE SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE

ACCOUNT. FOLLOWING THAT APPROVAL, WE RECEIVED CLAIM NOTICES WITH RESPECT TO

APPROXIMATELY $120 MILLION OF BONDS SECURING CERTAIN WORKERS COMPENSATION AND

RETIREE HEALTH BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF THE ACCOUNT. WE ORIGINALLY RECORDED A NET

PRETAX LOSS PROVISION OF $89 MILLION WHEN THE CLAIM NOTICES WERE RECEIVED. IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE RE-ESTIMATED THE AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLE RELATED TO THAT PRETAX LOSS, AND RECORDED A $27 MILLION REDUCTION

IN OUR NET LOSS. CONVERSELY, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE RECORDED A $27 MILLION

PROVISION TO STRENGTHEN OUR

SURETY

OPERATIONS PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO A RE-ESTIMATION OF

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE RELATED TO LOSSES INCURRED IN 2002 ASSOCIATED WITH

ENRON CORPORATIONS BANKRUPTCY.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, WE MADE COLLATERALIZED

ADVANCES TO A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR THAT HAD FAILED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER

CERTAIN OF ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THESE THIRD QUARTER ADVANCES DID NOT IMPACT

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BECAUSE THE LOSS INCURRED WAS OFFSET BY OUR ESTIMATED

RECOVERABLE.

IN RECENT MONTHS, THE CONTRACTOR HAS COMPLETED A

RESTRUCTURING OF ITS FINANCES AND ENTERED INTO REVISED CREDIT AGREEMENTS WITH

ITS LENDERS. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MITIGATE OUR ULTIMATE EXPOSURE TO THIS

ACCOUNT BY FACILITATING THE CONTRACTORS EFFORTS TO COMPLETE BONDED PROJECTS,

WE MADE ADDITIONAL ADVANCES FOR WHICH WE RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX LOSS, NET OF

ESTIMATED REINSURANCE AND CO-SURETY PARTICIPATION, OF APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003. WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR ESTIMATE OF THE

RECOVERABLE FROM THAT ESTABLISHED AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003. ANY

FUTURE CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATE OF THE RECOVERABLE, WHETHER POSITIVE OR

NEGATIVE, WILL AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE MAY MAKE FURTHER ADVANCES

AND, SUBJECT TO OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, WE MAY ALSO DECIDE TO ISSUE BONDS

FOR NEW PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN BY THIS CONTRACTOR.

IF THE CONTRACTOR WERE TO FAIL TO COMPLETE ITS BONDED

PROJECTS, WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE THAT OUR AGGREGATE ADDITIONAL LOSS, NET OF

ESTIMATED COLLATERAL, REINSURANCE RECOVERIES AND PARTICIPATION BY CO-SURETIES

(ONE OF WHICH HAS EXPERIENCED RATINGS DOWNGRADES AND IS IN RUNOFF), WOULD

LIKELY NOT EXCEED $75 MILLION ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS, ASSUMING A 35% STATUTORY

TAX RATE. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE CONTRACTORS BUSINESS AND

OTHER FACTORS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ESTIMATE AND OUR POTENTIAL

EXPOSURE WILL NOT INCREASE.

IN 2003, WE SECURED EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE COVERAGE

FOR OUR COMMERCIAL SURETY EXPOSURES IN THE FORM OF TWO NEW TREATIES PROVIDING

$500 MILLION OF AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD, WITH A MAXIMUM

RECOVERY OF $100 MILLION PER PRINCIPAL FOR GAS SUPPLY BONDS AND $150 MILLION

PER PRINCIPAL FOR OTHER BONDS. THE REINSURANCE PROGRAM DOES NOT EXTEND COVERAGE

TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL SURETY ACCOUNTS WHICH WERE IN BANKRUPTCY AT

THE INCEPTION OF THE REINSURANCE TREATIES.

DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS.

THE ACTIVITY ON RESERVES OF

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS REPRESENTS CERTAIN ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE 1999 SALE

OF OUR STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCE BUSINESS. THE RESERVE BALANCES

145

ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN

PORTIONS OF THE BUSINESS SOLD ARE INCLUDED IN OUR TOTAL RESERVES, BUT THE

RELATED INCURRED LOSSES ARE EXCLUDED FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN OUR

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, AND INCLUDED IN

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 17 FOR A DISCUSSION OF RESERVE GUARANTEES WE

MADE RELATED TO THIS SALE.

OUR HISTORICAL METHODOLOGY (THROUGH FIRST QUARTER

2002) FOR REVIEWING THE ADEQUACY OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS RESERVES

UTILIZED A SURVIVAL RATIO METRIC, WHICH CONSIDERS ENDING RESERVES IN RELATION

TO CALENDAR YEAR PAID LOSSES. WHEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE ANALYSES WERE

COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, WE SUPPLEMENTED OUR SURVIVAL RATIO

DIAGNOSTICS WITH ADDITIONAL DETAILED ANALYSES, AND CONCLUDED THAT OUR

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES WERE REDUNDANT BY APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION. BASED ON

OUR ADDITIONAL ANALYSES, WE RELEASED APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION OF

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002. HAD WE CONTINUED TO RELY

SOLELY ON OUR ANALYSIS OF SURVIVAL RATIO, WE WOULD HAVE RECORDED NO ADJUSTMENT

TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES THROUGH THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, WE ALSO SUPPLEMENTED

OUR SURVIVAL RATIO ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS RESERVES WITH A DETAILED CLAIMS

ANALYSIS. WE DETERMINED THAT, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE WESTERN MACARTHUR

SETTLEMENT, OUR ASBESTOS RESERVES WERE ADEQUATE; HOWEVER, INCLUDING THAT

IMPACT, WE DETERMINED THAT OUR ASBESTOS RESERVES WERE INADEQUATE. AS A RESULT,

GROSS AND NET ASBESTOS RESERVES WERE INCREASED $150 MILLION.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE UPDATED OUR DETAILED

ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS FOR BOTH ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES PERTAINING TO

OUR EXPOSURE FROM DIRECT POLICYHOLDERS AND RELIED MORE HEAVILY ON THESE

ANALYSES IN DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVE PROVISION FOR THE REMAINING

UNREPORTED LOSSES. FOR NON-WORKERS COMPENSATION ASBESTOS CLAIMS WE

SUPPLEMENTED THIS DETAILED ANALYSIS WITH AN ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE AN

ESTIMATE OF RESERVES SPECIFICALLY FOR POLICYHOLDERS WHO HAVE NOT AS YET

TENDERED THEIR FIRST ASBESTOS CLAIM. AS A RESULT OF THESE STUDIES WE INCREASED

NET ASBESTOS RESERVES BY $77 MILLION AND NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $14

MILLION. IN ADDITION, REVIEWS OF ASSUMED AND NON-DOMESTIC EXPOSURES CAUSED US

TO INCREASE NET ASBESTOS RESERVES BY $13 MILLION AND REDUCE NET ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES BY $1 MILLION.

IF WE BELIEVE THAT ANY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL

NOT RESULT IN FUTURE TAX BENEFITS, WE MUST ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR

THE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS THAT WE THINK WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE NET CHANGE

IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WAS A DECREASE OF $10

MILLION IN 2003, AND AN INCREASE OF $27 MILLION IN 2002, BOTH RELATING TO OUR

FOREIGN OPERATIONS. BASED PREDOMINANTLY UPON A REVIEW OF OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE

EARNINGS, BUT ALSO INCLUDING ALL OTHER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND

NEGATIVE, WE HAVE CONCLUDED IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT OUR NET DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED.

NET

OPERATING LOSS (NOL) AND FOREIGN TAX CREDIT (FTC) CARRYFORWARDS



FOR TAX RETURN PURPOSES, AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003, WE HAD NOL CARRYFORWARDS THAT EXPIRE, IF UNUSED, IN 2005-2022 AND FTC

CARRYFORWARDS THAT EXPIRE, IF UNUSED, IN 2005-2008. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF

REALIZING THE BENEFITS OF NOL AND FTC CARRYFORWARDS DEPEND ON FUTURE TAXABLE

INCOME AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY TAX LAWS. THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF THOSE

NOLS ON A REGULAR TAX BASIS AND AN ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX (AMT) BASIS WERE

$2.78 BILLION AND $988 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF THE

FTCS BOTH ON A REGULAR TAX BASIS AND AN AMT BASIS WERE $27 MILLION. THE

BENEFITS OF THE NOL AND FTC CARRYFORWARDS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

UNDISTRIBUTED

EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES



U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON $75 MILLION OF

OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, AS

SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE OPERATIONS. FURTHERMORE,

ANY TAXES PAID TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ON THESE EARNINGS MAY BE USED AS CREDITS

AGAINST THE U.S. TAX ON ANY DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SUCH EARNINGS.

WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED TAXES ON APPROXIMATELY $483

MILLION OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS RELATED TO OUR MAJORITY OWNERSHIP OF NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, BECAUSE WE CURRENTLY DO NOT EXPECT

THOSE EARNINGS TO BECOME TAXABLE TO US.

IRS EXAMINATIONS



THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE HAS EXAMINED

OUR CONSOLIDATED RETURNS THROUGH 2000 AND IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING THE YEARS 2001

THROUGH 2002. WE BELIEVE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL TAXES ASSESSED AS A RESULT OF

THESE EXAMINATIONS WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

AS DISCUSSED IN

MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2003 WE CONCLUDED THAT THE PROVISIONS OF FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE

149

INTEREST

ENTITIES(AS REVISED) (FIN 46(R)) APPLIED TO THE FIVE BUSINESS TRUSTS THAT

ISSUED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES TO INVESTORS WHICH WERE

FULLY GUARANTEED BY US. AS A RESULT, WE DECONSOLIDATED THESE TRUSTS, AND NOW

REPORT OUR BORROWINGS FROM THESE TRUSTS AS DEBT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET. IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2003, THE PREFERRED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THESE TRUSTS

AND GUARANTEED BY US WERE REPORTED IN OUR BALANCE SHEET AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM

BETWEEN TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND REFERRED TO AS COMPANY-OBLIGATED

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SECURITIES OF TRUSTS HOLDING SOLELY SUBORDINATED

DEBENTURES OF THE COMPANY. PRIOR TO 2003, THE DEBT ISSUED BY US TO THE TRUSTS

WAS ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE PROVISIONS

OF THE FIVE BUSINESS TRUSTS, EACH OF WHICH WAS FORMED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF

ISSUING THOSE SECURITIES.

·

ST.

PAUL CAPITAL TRUST I ISSUED 23,000,000 PREFERRED SECURITIES GENERATING GROSS

PROCEEDS OF $575 MILLION, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE USED TO PURCHASE

SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY US. WE MAKE QUARTERLY INTEREST PAYMENTS AT A

RATE OF 7.6% ON THE DEBENTURES, WHICH HAVE A MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE OF OCTOBER 15,

2050. THE PREFERRED SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUST IN TURN PAY A QUARTERLY

DISTRIBUTION AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 7.6%. WE CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES ON OR

AFTER NOVEMBER 13, 2006. THE PROCEEDS OF SUCH REDEMPTION WOULD BE USED BY

THE TRUST TO REDEEM A LIKE AMOUNT OF ITS PREFERRED SECURITIES.

·

MMI

CAPITAL TRUST I ISSUED $125 MILLION OF PREFERRED SECURITIES IN 1997, THE

PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE USED TO PURCHASE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY MMI

CORPORATION. WE ASSUMED THE LIABILITY FOR THESE DEBENTURES UPON OUR ACQUISITION

OF MMI IN 2000. WE MAKE SEMI-ANNUAL INTEREST PAYMENTS AT A RATE OF 7.625% ON

THE DEBENTURES, WHICH HAVE A MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE OF DECEMBER 15,

2027. THE PREFERRED SECURITIES IN TURN PAY A PREFERRED DISTRIBUTION OF 7.625%

SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS. IN 2002, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED $4 MILLION OF THE

MMI TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES IN AN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTION.

·

USF&G

CAPITAL TRUSTS I, II AND III EACH ISSUED $100 MILLION OF PREFERRED

SECURITIES IN 1997 AND 1996, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE USED TO PURCHASE

SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY USF&G CORPORATION, WHICH MADE SEMI-ANNUAL

INTEREST PAYMENTS AT RATES OF 8.5%, 8.47% AND 8.312%, RESPECTIVELY. WE ASSUMED

THE LIABILITY FOR THESE DEBENTURES UPON OUR MERGER WITH USF&G CORPORATION

IN 1998. SINCE THE MERGER, WE HAVE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED SECURITIES FROM EACH

TRUST FROM TIME TO TIME IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS. THE DEBENTURES RELATED TO

THE USF&G CAPITAL TRUST I, II AND III HAVE MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATES

OF DECEMBER 15, 2045, JANUARY 10, 2027 AND JULY 1, 2046, RESPECTIVELY.

DEBENTURES RELATED TO EACH TRUST MAY, HOWEVER, BE REDEEMED EARLIER UNDER

CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT VARY AMONG THE THREE TRUSTS. THE PROCEEDS OF SUCH

REDEMPTIONS WOULD BE USED TO REDEEM A LIKE AMOUNT OF EACH TRUSTS PREFERRED

SECURITIES.

OUR TOTAL DISTRIBUTION

EXPENSE RELATED TO ALL OF THESE PREFERRED SECURITIES PRIOR TO DECONSOLIDATION

WAS $70 MILLION IN 2002 AND $33 MILLION IN 2001. IN 2003, OUR INTEREST EXPENSE

RELATED TO OUR DEBT TO THESE TRUSTS TOTALED $72 MILLION.

MARCH 2002, WE ISSUED $500 MILLION OF SENIOR NOTES DUE IN 2007. PROCEEDS

MEDIUM-TERM

NOTES



THE

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 BEAR INTEREST RATES

RANGING FROM 6.3% TO 7.4%, WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE RATE OF 6.8%. MATURITIES

RANGE FROM FIVE TO 15 YEARS AFTER THE ISSUANCE DATES. DURING 2003 AND 2002,

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES HAVING A PAR VALUE OF $67 MILLION AND $49 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

MATURED, AND PAYMENTS AT MATURITY WERE FUNDED WITH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS.

5.25%

SENIOR NOTES



IN

JULY 2002, CONCURRENT WITH THE ISSUANCE OF 17.8 MILLION OF OUR COMMON

SHARES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING, WE ISSUED 8.9 MILLION EQUITY UNITS, EACH HAVING A

STATED AMOUNT OF $50, FOR GROSS

150

CONSIDERATION OF $443

MILLION. EACH EQUITY UNIT INITIALLY CONSISTS OF A FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACT FOR

THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK (MATURING IN 2005), AND AN UNSECURED $50 SENIOR NOTE

OF THE COMPANY (MATURING IN 2007). TOTAL ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE EQUITY

UNITS ARE AT THE RATE OF 9.00%, CONSISTING OF INTEREST ON THE NOTE AT A RATE OF

5.25% AND FEE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FORWARD CONTRACT OF 3.75%. THE FORWARD

CONTRACT REQUIRES THE INVESTOR TO PURCHASE, FOR $50, A VARIABLE NUMBER OF

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF AUGUST 16, 2005. THE

$46 MILLION PRESENT VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACT FEE PAYMENTS WAS RECORDED AS

A REDUCTION TO OUR REPORTED COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN 2002. THE NUMBER OF

SHARES TO BE PURCHASED WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON A FORMULA THAT CONSIDERS THE

AVERAGE TRADING PRICE OF THE STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT

IN RELATION TO THE $24.20 PER SHARE PRICE AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING. HAD THE

SETTLEMENT DATE BEEN DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE WOULD HAVE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY

15 MILLION COMMON SHARES BASED ON THE AVERAGE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK

IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THAT DATE. THE MAJORITY OF PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE

CONTRIBUTED AS CAPITAL TO OUR INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES, WITH THE

BALANCE BEING USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

COMMERCIAL

PAPER



WE

MAINTAIN AN $800 MILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM WITH $600 MILLION OF BACK-UP

LIQUIDITY, CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF BANK CREDIT AGREEMENTS. INTEREST RATES ON

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED IN 2003 RANGED FROM 1.1% TO 1.5%, IN 2002 THE RANGE WAS

1.4% TO 2.1%; AND IN 2001 THE RANGE WAS 1.1% TO 6.7%.

NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS DEBT



IN

SEPTEMBER 2003, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ISSUED $300 MILLION OF 4.22% NOTES IN A

PRIVATE PLACEMENT. THE NOTES MATURE IN 2008. A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS WAS USED

TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT AND REPAY A $105 MILLION LOAN FROM THE ST. PAUL. THE

REMAINDER WILL BE USED FOR NUVEEN INVESTMENTS GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE

$302 MILLION CARRYING VALUE OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NEWLY-ISSUED DEBT IN THE

FOREGOING TABLE INCLUDED THE UNAMORTIZED GAINS FROM THE CANCELLATION OF PRIOR

INTEREST RATE SWAP TRANSACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT, AS

WELL AS UNAMORTIZED PRIVATE PLACEMENT DEBT ISSUE COSTS. NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 CONSISTED OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS

REVOLVING BANK LINE OF CREDIT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE

INTEREST RATE ON DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE BANK LINE OF CREDIT WAS

APPROXIMATELY 2.0%.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, WE WERE PARTY TO A NUMBER OF INTEREST RATE

SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH A TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $730 MILLION RELATED TO SEVERAL

OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT ISSUES. THE NET EFFECT OF THE SWAPS WAS TO REDUCE OUR

INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2003 AND 2002 BY $32 MILLION AND $21 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUES OF THESE SWAP AGREEMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003

AND 2002 WERE ASSETS OF $46 MILLION AND $65 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR

OUR OTHER DEBT, WHICH HAS LONGER TERMS AND FIXED INTEREST RATES, OUR FAIR VALUE

ESTIMATE WAS BASED ON CURRENT INTEREST RATES AVAILABLE ON DEBT SECURITIES IN

THE MARKET THAT HAVE TERMS SIMILAR TO OURS.

PREFERRED

THE PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY ON OUR BALANCE

SHEET REPRESENTS THE PAR VALUE OF PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING THAT WE ISSUED

TO OUR STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP) TRUST, LESS THE REMAINING PRINCIPAL BALANCE

ON THE SOP TRUST DEBT. THE SOP TRUST BORROWED FUNDS FROM A U.S. UNDERWRITING

SUBSIDIARY TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF THE PREFERRED SHARES, AND WE GUARANTEED

THE SOP DEBT.

THE SOP TRUST MAY AT ANY

TIME CONVERT ANY OR ALL OF THE PREFERRED SHARES INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

AT A RATE OF EIGHT SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR EACH PREFERRED SHARE. OUR BOARD

OF DIRECTORS HAS RESERVED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OUR AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES

TO SATISFY THE CONVERSION OF ALL PREFERRED SHARES ISSUED TO THE SOP TRUST AND

THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES TO MEET EMPLOYEE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS.

UPON THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES, WE WILL ISSUE SHARES OF OUR COMMON

WE REACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 13 MILLION OF OUR COMMON

SHARES IN 2001 FOR A TOTAL COST OF $589 MILLION. WE REDUCED OUR CAPITAL STOCK

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS



WE PRIMARILY DEPEND ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR

SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, SERVICE OUR DEBT, AND PAY

EXPENSES. ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY (FIRE AND MARINE) IS OUR

LEAD U.S. PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY AND ITS DIVIDEND PAYING

CAPACITY IS LIMITED BY THE LAWS OF MINNESOTA, ITS STATE OF DOMICILE. BUSINESS

AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS MAY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS ACTUALLY PAID.

APPROXIMATELY $774 MILLION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US FROM PAYMENT OF ORDINARY

DIVIDENDS BY FIRE AND MARINE IN 2004. ANY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS BEYOND THE $774

MILLION LIMITATION WOULD REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE MINNESOTA COMMISSIONER

OF COMMERCE. FIRE AND MARINES ABILITY TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS FROM ITS DIRECT AND

INDIRECT UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE LAWS OF

THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS OF DOMICILE. DURING 2003, WE

RECEIVED DIVIDENDS IN THE FORM OF CASH AND SECURITIES OF $625 MILLION FROM OUR

U.S. UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES. WE RECEIVED NO CASH DIVIDENDS FROM OUR U.S.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES IN 2002. IN 2001, WE RECEIVED

DIVIDENDS IN THE FORM OF CASH AND SECURITIES OF $827 MILLION FROM FIRE AND

MARINE.

ACQUISITIONS & DIVESTITURES

ACQUISITIONS

IN MAY 2003, WE PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO SEEK

RENEWAL OF SEVERAL LINES OF INSURANCE BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY UNDERWRITTEN BY

KEMPER INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE INITIAL PAYMENT FOR THIS RIGHT WAS RECORDED AS

AN INTANGIBLE ASSET (CHARACTERIZED AS RENEWAL RIGHTS) AND IS BEING AMORTIZED ON

AN ACCELERATED BASIS OVER FOUR YEARS. THE PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESS INVOLVED IN

THIS TRANSACTION INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING LINES: TECHNOLOGY, SMALL COMMERCIAL,

MIDDLE MARKET COMMERCIAL, INLAND AND OCEAN MARINE, AND ARCHITECTS AND

ENGINEERS PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY. WE DID NOT ASSUME ANY PAST LIABILITIES WITH

THIS PURCHASE; HOWEVER, WE WILL BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT IN JUNE 2004

BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PREMIUM VOLUME WE ULTIMATELY RENEW DURING THE TWELVE

MONTH PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO THIS PURCHASE. WE BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY

ADDITIONAL PAYMENT WOULD EXCEED $30 MILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE HAD

ACCRUED $10 MILLION TOWARD THIS ADDITIONAL OBLIGATION, RECORDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES.  OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS

WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 INCLUDED

APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN AS A RESULT OF

THIS PURCHASE OF RENEWAL RIGHTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN OUR

COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT.

PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISK PRACTICE (PROFIN)

BUSINESS



IN DECEMBER 2002, WE

PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO SEEK RENEWAL OF THE FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY UNDERWRITTEN BY ROYAL & SUNALLIANCE (RSA),

WITHOUT ASSUMING PAST LIABILITIES. THIS BUSINESS REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY $125

MILLION IN EXPIRING PREMIUM. THE NOMINAL COST OF THE ACQUISITION WAS RECORDED

AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET (CHARACTERIZED AS RENEWAL RIGHTS) AND WILL BE AMORTIZED

ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS OVER FOUR YEARS.

ST. PAUL GUARANTEE



IN MARCH 2002,

WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF LONDON GUARANTEE INSURANCE COMPANY (NOW

OPERATING UNDER THE NAME ST. PAUL GUARANTEE), A CANADIAN SPECIALTY

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE COMPANY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING SURETY PRODUCTS AND

MANAGEMENT LIABILITY, BOND, AND PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY PRODUCTS. THE TOTAL COST

OF THE ACQUISITION WAS APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION. THE PRELIMINARY ALLOCATION OF

THIS PURCHASE PRICE RESULTED IN $20 MILLION OF GOODWILL AND $37 MILLION OF

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. WE RECORDED $13 MILLION OF THE GOODWILL AND $26

MILLION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CHARACTERIZED AS PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE

PROFITS) IN OUR SURETY & CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT, WITH THE REMAINING $7

MILLION OF GOODWILL AND $11 MILLION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN OUR

INTERNATIONAL AND LLOYDS SEGMENT. THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS BEING AMORTIZED ON

AN ACCELERATED BASIS OVER EIGHT YEARS. THE ACQUISITION WAS FUNDED THROUGH

INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS.

ST. PAUL GUARANTEES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE

INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET BEGINNING JUNE 30, 2002, AND

THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE WERE INCLUDED IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2002. ST. PAUL GUARANTEE PRODUCED NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $57 MILLION AND AN

UNDERWRITING LOSS OF $6 MILLION SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE. IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2002 WE MADE A PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO OUR

DEFERRED TAX ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH DECREASED GOODWILL BY $2 MILLION.

IN DECEMBER 2001,

WE PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO SEEK TO RENEW SURETY BOND BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY

UNDERWRITTEN BY FIREMANS FUND INSURANCE COMPANY (FIREMANS FUND), WITHOUT

ASSUMING PAST LIABILITIES. WE PAID FIREMANS FUND $10 MILLION IN 2001 FOR THIS

RIGHT, WHICH WE RECORDED AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET AND WHICH WE ARE AMORTIZING ON

AN ACCELERATED BASIS OVER NINE YEARS. BASED ON THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS RENEWED

DURING 2002, WE MADE A MODEST ADDITIONAL PAYMENT TO FIREMANS FUND IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2003. THAT AMOUNT WAS ALSO RECORDED AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET AND IS

BEING AMORTIZED ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE

INTANGIBLE ASSET.

PENCO



IN JANUARY 2001,

WE ACQUIRED THE RIGHT TO SEEK TO RENEW A BOOK OF MUNICIPALITY INSURANCE

BUSINESS FROM PENCO, A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR FOR WILLIS NORTH AMERICA INC., FOR

TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF $3.5 MILLION, WITHOUT ASSUMING PAST LIABILITIES. WE

RECORDED THAT AMOUNT AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET AND ARE AMORTIZING IT ON AN

ACCELERATED BASIS OVER FIVE YEARS.

NWQ INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY,

INC.

IN AUGUST 2002, NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS PURCHASED NWQ INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY, INC. (NWQ), A

LOS ANGELES-BASED EQUITY MANAGEMENT FIRM, WITH APPROXIMATELY $6.9 BILLION IN

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. THE COST OF THE ACQUISITION

CONSISTED OF $120 MILLION PAID AT CLOSING AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $20 MILLION

PAYABLE OVER FIVE YEARS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS HAD

$133 MILLION RECORDED FOR GOODWILL AND $19 MILLION FOR THE INTANGIBLE ASSET,

NET OF ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, RELATED TO NWQ. THE INTANGIBLE ASSET RELATES

TO CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER NINE YEARS.

SYMPHONY ASSET MANAGEMENT

IN

JULY 2001, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS PURCHASED SYMPHONY ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (SYMPHONY),

AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGER BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO, WITH APPROXIMATELY

$4 BILLION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. THE 2001

PRELIMINARY ALLOCATION OF THE $208 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE RESULTED IN $151

MILLION RECORDED AS GOODWILL AND $53 MILLION RECORDED AS OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS. IN 2002, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS MADE A PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT DUE

TO A REVISION IN THE VALUATION OF SYMPHONY, WHICH RESULTED IN A $9 MILLION

DECREASE IN THE INTANGIBLE RECORDED AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE

GOODWILL RECORDED. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS HAD $158

MILLION RECORDED FOR GOODWILL AND $39 MILLION FOR NET INTANGIBLES RELATED TO

SYMPHONY. THE MAJORITY OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS.

154

DIVESTITURES

IN DECEMBER 2003, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF

CAMPERDOWN UK LIMITED, ONE OF OUR LLOYDS CORPORATE NAMES AND THE VEHICLE FOR

OUR PARTICIPATION ON THE 2003 AND PRIOR YEAR OF ACCOUNT, TO FOLTUS INVESTMENTS

LIMITED. WE RECOGNIZED A $2 MILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THIS TRANSACTION. AT LLOYDS,

WE UNDERWRITE BUSINESS THROUGH A SINGLE SYNDICATE (SYNDICATE 5000) FOR WHICH

WE PROVIDE 100% OF THE CAPITAL. IN 2003, FIRE AND MARINE ENTERED INTO A 100%

QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT DIRECTLY WITH SYNDICATE 5000 THAT IN EFFECT

TRANSFERRED SYNDICATE 5000S UNDERWRITING RESULTS FOR THE 2003 YEAR OF ACCOUNT

TO FIRE AND MARINE. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, WE

ACTIVATED TWO CORPORATE NAMES THAT WILL BE USED FOR 2004 AND FUTURE YEARS OF

ACCOUNT TO UNDERWRITE SYNDICATE 5000 BUSINESS.

IN OCTOBER 2003, WE SOLD OUR SUBSIDIARY, OCTAGON

RISK SERVICES, INC., A CLAIM MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES COMPANY,

FOR PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION. WE RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN OF $5

MILLION ON THE SALE.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, WE SOLD OUR SUBSIDIARY

BOTSWANA INSURANCE COMPANY LTD. FOR TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $11 MILLION, AND RECORDED

A PRETAX LOSS OF LESS THAN $1 MILLION.

IN 2002, WE SOLD OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS IN SPAIN,

ARGENTINA AND, IN MEXICO, ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS EXCEPT OUR SURETY BUSINESS. PROCEEDS

FROM THESE SALES TOTALED $29 MILLION AND WE RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN OF $4

MILLION RELATED TO THE SALES.

MATERIAL GUARANTEES OR

INDEMNIFICATIONS PROVIDED AS PART OF THESE SALES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 16

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES.

12   VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES

FIN

46(R)



IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB

ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES, WHICH WAS REPLACED IN DECEMBER 2003 (FIN 46(R)). FIN 46(R),

ALONG WITH ITS RELATED INTERPRETATIONS, REQUIRES CONSOLIDATION OF ALL VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES (VIE) BY THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, AS THESE TERMS ARE

DEFINED IN FIN 46(R). WE BEGAN APPLYING THE CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW

VIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. FOR VIES CREATED

BEFORE

JANUARY 31, 2003, THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ADOPTION

WAS DEFERRED UNTIL THE FIRST INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIOD ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2003 (FOR US, THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004), BUT EARLY AND PARTIAL ADOPTION WERE

PERMITTED.

WE CHOSE TO PARTIALLY ADOPT FIN 46(R) UNDER THE EARLY

ADOPTION PROVISIONS IN 2003, WHICH RESULTED IN US CONSOLIDATING CERTAIN

ENTITIES (SUMMARIZED BELOW) THAT WE HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED. WE ARE

STILL EVALUATING THE IMPLICATIONS OF FIN 46(R) ON OUR PARTICIPATION IN VARIOUS

LLOYDS UNDERWRITING SYNDICATES. UPON PARTIAL ADOPTION, WE RECORDED A LOSS OF

$21 MILLION (NET OF A DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT OF $3 MILLION) IN OUR CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN 2003, CLASSIFIED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ACCOUNTING CHANGE AND REPRESENTING THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF FIN 46(R) ON

PERIODS PRIOR TO THE JULY 1, 2003 DATE OF PARTIAL ADOPTION.

THE ENTITIES THAT WE CONSOLIDATED (OR DECONSOLIDATED,

WITH RESPECT TO THE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF TRUSTS) UNDER OUR PARTIAL ADOPTION

OF FIN 46(R) WERE AS FOLLOWS.

·

INVESTMENT

WE HOLD AN INVESTMENT IN AN

INSURANCE COMPANY THAT PROVIDES INSURANCE COVERAGE TO MARKETS IN BALTIMORE AND

WASHINGTON D.C. OUR INVESTMENT INCLUDES A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, BUT NONE OF ITS VOTING COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT

OF OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE ENTITY, WE HAVE THE MAJORITY EXPOSURE TO

VARIABILITY THROUGH OUR PREFERRED STOCK OWNERSHIP AND A LOAN TO THE COMPANY,

BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED VARIABLE INTERESTS AS DEFINED IN FIN 46(R). ACCORDINGLY,

WE BEGAN CONSOLIDATING THIS ENTITY IN THE THIRD QUARTER. THE CARRYING VALUE OF

THIS INVESTMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION.

155

·

MUNICIPAL TRUSTS

WE OWN INTERESTS IN

VARIOUS MUNICIPAL TRUSTS THAT WERE FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ALLOWING US TO

MORE FLEXIBLY GENERATE INVESTMENT INCOME IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH OUR INVESTMENT

OBJECTIVES AND TAX POSITION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THERE WERE 36 SUCH

TRUSTS, WHICH HELD A COMBINED TOTAL OF $450 MILLION IN MUNICIPAL SECURITIES, OF

WHICH EIGHT HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PRIOR TO OUR ADOPTION OF FIN 46(R) BECAUSE WE DID NOT HOLD MAJORITY OWNERSHIP

IN THEM. HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE THE MAJORITY EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY FOR THESE

TRUSTS. THEREFORE, WE CONSOLIDATED THESE EIGHT TRUSTS IN 2003. THE COMBINED

CARRYING VALUE OF THESE TRUSTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS $366 MILLION.

·

VENTURE CAPITAL ENTITIES

IN OUR VENTURE

CAPITAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, WE HAVE NUMEROUS INVESTMENTS IN SMALL- TO

MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES, IN WHICH WE HAVE VARIABLE INTERESTS THROUGH STOCK

OWNERSHIP AND, IN SOME CASES, LOANS. ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE HELD FOR THE

PURPOSE OF GENERATING INVESTMENT RETURNS, AND THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST

SPAN A VARIETY OF BUSINESS SECTORS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS

AND HEALTHCARE. AS A RESULT OF OUR REVIEW OF THIS PORTFOLIO, WE IDENTIFIED

THREE ENTITIES THAT WE ARE NOW CONSOLIDATING UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R).

THE COMBINED CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ENTITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS $(5) MILLION.

·

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF TRUSTS

HOLDING SOLELY SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES OF THE COMPANY

(PREFERRED

SECURITIES)THESE SECURITIES HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF $897 MILLION, AND PRIOR

TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 WERE CLASSIFIED AS A SEPARATE LINE ON OUR BALANCE

SHEET BETWEEN LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THESE SECURITIES WERE

ISSUED BY FIVE SEPARATE TRUSTS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF

ISSUING THE SECURITIES TO INVESTORS, AND THE SECURITIES WERE FULLY GUARANTEED

BY US. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, WE RECLASSIFIED THESE SECURITIES TO DEBT

IN THE LIABILITY SECTION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AS NEWLY REQUIRED

UNDER SFAS 150, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH

CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY, WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRED THAT

AN ISSUER CLASSIFY A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT IS WITHIN ITS SCOPE AS A

LIABILITY (OR AN ASSET IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES). IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003,

WE DETERMINED THAT THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R) APPLIED TO THE TRUSTS THAT

ISSUED THESE SECURITIES, AND AS A RESULT WE DECONSOLIDATED THE TRUSTS FOR FINANCIAL

REPORTING PURPOSES. THE DEBT WE ISSUED TO THESE TRUSTS, PREVIOUSLY ELIMINATED

IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, IS NOW INCLUDED IN THE DEBT

SECTION OF LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE NET IMPACT OF

DE-CONSOLIDATING THESE TRUSTS WAS TO INCREASE OUR REPORTED DEBT LIABILITIES

OUTSTANDING BY $928 MILLION AND ELIMINATE THE $897 MILLION OF PREFERRED

SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUSTS FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AMOUNTS WAS COMPRISED OF THE $31 MILLION COMBINED

EQUITY INTERESTS WE HELD IN THE DECONSOLIDATED TRUSTS.

156

THE

CONSOLIDATION/DECONSOLIDATION OF THE FOREGOING ENTITIES HAD THE NET IMPACT OF

INCREASING (DECREASING) THE BALANCE SHEET AND STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS CAPTIONS

BY THE AMOUNTS INDICATED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

IN ADDITION TO THE

FOREGOING ENTITIES THAT WERE CONSOLIDATED PURSUANT TO FIN 46(R), WE ALSO HOLD

SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN OTHER VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT

CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, AS FOLLOWS.

·

WE

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTEREST IN TWO REAL ESTATE ENTITIES, BUT WE ARE

NOT CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE OF THESE

ENTITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $48 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, WHICH

ALSO REPRESENTS OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS. THE PURPOSE OF OUR INVOLVEMENT IN

THESE ENTITIES IS TO GENERATE INVESTMENT RETURNS.

·

WE

ALSO HAVE CERTAIN REMAINING VARIABLE INTERESTS IN CAMPERDOWN UK LIMITED, AN

ENTITY THAT WE SOLD IN 2003. WE UTILIZED THIS ENTITY AS ONE OF OUR CORPORATE

NAMES AND THE VEHICLE FOR OUR PARTICIPATION AT LLOYDS FOR 2003 AND PRIOR YEARS

OF ACCOUNT THROUGH A SINGLE SYNDICATE (SYNDICATE 5000). OUR VARIABLE INTEREST

RESULTS FROM AN AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER FOR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF

ADVERSE CHANGES IN UNDERWRITING, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND FOREIGN TAX RESULTS. THE

MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THIS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION IS $203 MILLION. IN ADDITION,

IN 2003 WE ENTERED INTO A 100% QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH SYNDICATE

5000 THAT IN EFFECT TRANSFERRED SYNDICATE 5000S UNDERWRITING RESULTS FOR THE

2003 YEAR OF ACCOUNT TO US.

13   RETIREMENT

PLANS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANSWE MAINTAIN FUNDED

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR MOST OF OUR EMPLOYEES. THESE PLANS PROVIDE

BENEFITS UNDER THREE RETIREMENT BENEFIT FORMULAS: A TRADITIONAL PENSION

FORMULA, A CASH BALANCE PENSION FORMULA AND A CASH BALANCE RETIREE HEALTH

FORMULA. FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE IN THE TRADITIONAL PENSION FORMULA,

BENEFITS ARE BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND THE EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION WHILE

EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. PENSION BENEFITS GENERALLY VEST AFTER FIVE YEARS OF

SERVICE.

FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES COVERED UNDER THE CASH BALANCE

PENSION FORMULA, WE MAINTAIN A CASH BALANCE PENSION ACCOUNT TO MEASURE THE

AMOUNT OF BENEFITS PAYABLE TO AN EMPLOYEE. FOR EACH PLAN YEAR AN EMPLOYEE IS AN

ACTIVE PARTICIPANT, THE CASH BALANCE PENSION ACCOUNT IS INCREASED FOR PAY

CREDITS AND INTEREST CREDITS. PAY CREDITS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON AGE, VESTING

SERVICE AND ACTUAL PENSIONABLE EARNINGS, AND ADDED TO THE ACCOUNT ON THE FIRST

DAY OF THE NEXT PLAN YEAR. INTEREST CREDITS ARE ADDED AT THE END OF EACH

CALENDAR QUARTER. THESE BENEFITS VEST AFTER FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE. IF AN

EMPLOYEE IS VESTED UNDER THE CASH BALANCE

157

FORMULA WHEN THEIR

EMPLOYMENT WITH US ENDS, THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE FORMULA AMOUNT IN

THEIR CASH BALANCE PENSION ACCOUNT.

THE TRADITIONAL PENSION PLAN AND CASH BALANCE PENSION

FORMULAS WERE AMENDED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, WHICH REDUCED THE

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $84 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. IN

ADDITION, THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN WAS AMENDED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2003. AS A RESULT, POSTRETIREMENT LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE WAS ELIMINATED FOR

ACTIVE EMPLOYEES, AND EMPLOYEES WHO WERE NOT WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF RETIREMENT

ELIGIBILITY WERE SWITCHED TO THE CASH BALANCE RETIREE HEALTH FORMULA FROM THE

TRADITIONAL POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE BENEFIT PLAN. THESE ACTIONS REDUCED THE

ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $22 MILLION.

OUR PENSION PLANS ARE NONCONTRIBUTORY. THIS MEANS THAT

EMPLOYEES DO NOT PAY ANYTHING INTO THE PLANS. OUR FUNDING POLICY IS TO

CONTRIBUTE AMOUNTS AT LEAST SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT THAT CAN BE DEDUCTED FOR FEDERAL

INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THIS MAY RESULT IN NO CONTRIBUTION BEING MADE IN A

PARTICULAR YEAR.

OUR PENSION PLAN MEASUREMENT DATE IS DECEMBER 31.

WE MAINTAIN NONCONTRIBUTORY, UNFUNDED PENSION PLANS TO

PROVIDE CERTAIN COMPANY EMPLOYEES WITH PENSION BENEFITS IN EXCESS OF LIMITS

IMPOSED BY FEDERAL TAX LAW. THESE UNQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS ARE NOT MATERIAL AND

ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLES THAT FOLLOW.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONSWE PROVIDE

CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR RETIRED EMPLOYEES (AND

THEIR ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS), WHO ARE IN THE TRADITIONAL FORMULA. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE

THAT MOST COVERED EMPLOYEES WILL BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR THESE BENEFITS IF THEY

RETIRE WHILE WORKING FOR US. THE COST OF THESE BENEFITS IS SHARED WITH THE

RETIREE. THE BENEFITS ARE GENERALLY PROVIDED THROUGH OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

TRUST, TO WHICH PERIODIC CONTRIBUTIONS ARE MADE TO COVER BENEFITS PAID DURING

THE YEAR. WE ACCRUE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS EXPENSE DURING THE PERIOD OF THE

EMPLOYEES SERVICE.

FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES COVERED UNDER THE CASH BALANCE

RETIREE HEALTH FORMULA, WE MAINTAIN A CASH BALANCE RETIREE HEALTH ACCOUNT (HEALTH

ACCOUNT) TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFITS PAYABLE TO AN EMPLOYEE. FOR EACH

PLAN YEAR AN EMPLOYEE IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT, THE HEALTH ACCOUNT IS INCREASED

FOR PAY CREDITS AND INTEREST CREDITS. PAY CREDITS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON

PENSIONABLE EARNINGS UP TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAXABLE WAGE BASE FOR THE PLAN

YEAR AND ADDED TO THE HEALTH ACCOUNT ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEXT PLAN YEAR. INTEREST

CREDITS ARE ADDED AT THE END OF EACH CALENDAR QUARTER.

THESE BENEFITS VEST AFTER FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE. IF AN

EMPLOYEE IS VESTED UNDER THE CASH BALANCE FORMULA WHEN THEIR EMPLOYMENT WITH US

ENDS, THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE AMOUNT IN THEIR HEALTH ACCOUNT. OUR

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS PLAN ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER, AND INCLUDED IN THE 2003

RESULTS OF, THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN.

ACTUAL ASSET RETURNS IN TOTAL, RATHER THAN BY ASSET CLASS, GIVING CONSIDERATION

TO THE FACT THAT OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS HAVE A HIGHER VOLATILITY THAN OUR OTHER

INVESTMENT CLASSES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MARKET IN GENERAL.

A

ESTABLISHED THROUGH CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF PLAN LIABILITIES, PLAN FUNDED

AS TOOLS TO FACILITATE THE INVESTMENT OF PLAN ASSETS TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM

OUR UNQUALIFIED PENSION PLAN HAD A PRETAX ACCUMULATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATION IN EXCESS OF THE RECORDED ACCRUED PENSION COST TOTALING $6

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. AS A RESULT, WE ACCRUED AN ADDITIONAL

MINIMUM LIABILITY OF $4 MILLION (AFTER-TAX) IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, WITH AN

OFFSETTING REDUCTION TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

ON DECEMBER 8, 2003,

THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE ACT)

WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THIS ACT INTRODUCES PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE UNDER

MEDICARE FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES BEGINNING IN 2006 AS WELL AS A FEDERAL

SUBSIDY TO CERTAIN SPONSORS OF RETIREE HEALTH CARE PLANS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT

THE BENEFITS WE PAY AFTER 2006 WILL BE LOWER AS A RESULT OF THE NEW MEDICARE

PROVISIONS. HOWEVER, THE RETIREE MEDICAL OBLIGATIONS REPORTED AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 DO NOT REFLECT THE IMPACT OF THIS LEGISLATION. DEFERRING THE RECOGNITION

OF THE NEW MEDICARE PROVISIONS IMPACT IS PERMITTED BY FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD STAFF POSITION 106-1 AS A RESULT OF OPEN QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME

OF THE NEW MEDICARE PROVISIONS AND A LACK OF AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

ABOUT CERTAIN MATTERS. WE CHOSE TO DEFER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT PENDING

THE ISSUANCE OF FINAL ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FROM THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD. THE FINAL ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED INFORMATION. WE WILL MONITOR THE FASB DELIBERATIONS AND

ACCOUNT FOR THE ACT BASED ON THE PRONOUNCEMENT EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED.

OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) WERE MERGED INTO THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC.

STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP). THE PLAN ALLOCATES PREFERRED SHARES SEMIANNUALLY

TO THOSE EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN OUR SAVINGS PLUS PLAN. UNDER THE SOP, WE

MATCH 100% OF EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 6% OF THEIR SALARY. WE

ALSO ALLOCATE PREFERRED SHARES EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF DIVIDENDS ON PREVIOUSLY

ALLOCATED SHARES.

TO FINANCE THE PREFERRED

STOCK PURCHASE FOR FUTURE ALLOCATION TO QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, THE SOP (FORMERLY

THE PSOP) BORROWED $150 MILLION AT 9.4% FROM OUR PRIMARY U.S. UNDERWRITING

SUBSIDIARY. AS THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OF THE TRUSTS LOAN IS PAID, A PRO

RATA AMOUNT OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK IS RELEASED FOR ALLOCATION TO PARTICIPATING

EMPLOYEES. EACH SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK PAYS A DIVIDEND OF $11.72 ANNUALLY AND

IS CURRENTLY CONVERTIBLE INTO EIGHT SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. PREFERRED STOCK

DIVIDENDS ON ALL SHARES HELD BY THE TRUST ARE USED TO PAY A PORTION OF THIS SOP

OBLIGATION. IN ADDITION TO DIVIDENDS PAID TO THE TRUST, WE MAKE ADDITIONAL CASH

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SOP AS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET THE SOPS DEBT

OBLIGATION.

THE SOP (FORMERLY THE

ESOP) BORROWED FUNDS TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK FOR FUTURE

ALLOCATION TO QUALIFIED PARTICIPATING U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE FINAL PRINCIPAL

PAYMENT ON THE TRUSTS LOAN WAS MADE IN 1998. AS THE PRINCIPAL OF THE TRUST

LOAN WAS PAID, A PRO RATA AMOUNT OF OUR COMMON STOCK WAS RELEASED FOR

ALLOCATION TO ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS. COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS ON SHARES ALLOCATED

UNDER THE FORMER ESOP ARE PAID DIRECTLY TO PARTICIPANTS.

ALL COMMON SHARES AND THE

COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENT OF ALL PREFERRED SHARES HELD BY THE SOP ARE CONSIDERED

OUTSTANDING FOR DILUTED EPS COMPUTATIONS AND DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALL SHARES ARE

CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

WE FOLLOW THE PROVISIONS

OF STATEMENT OF POSITION 76-3, ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLANS, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS IN ACCOUNTING FOR THIS PLAN. WE

RECORDED EXPENSE OF $13.8 MILLION, $7.4 MILLION AND $0.5 MILLION FOR THE YEARS

2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

MILLION AND $47 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE

REMAINING UNALLOCATED PREFERRED SHARES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WILL BE

RELEASED FOR ALLOCATION ANNUALLY THROUGH JANUARY 31, 2005.

ANY UNVESTED BALANCES

UNDER THE PLAN WILL IMMEDIATELY VEST UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE PROPOSED MERGER,

WHICH CONSTITUTES A CHANGE OF CONTROL AS DEFINED BY THE PLAN.

14

STOCK

INCENTIVE PLANS

WE HAVE MADE FIXED STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO CERTAIN U.S.

AND NON-U.S.-BASED EMPLOYEES, AS WELL AS OUTSIDE DIRECTORS. THESE GRANTS WERE

CONSIDERED FIXED BECAUSE THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR DETERMINING COMPENSATION

COSTS WAS FIXED ON THE DATE OF GRANT. IN THE PAST WE HAVE ALSO MADE VARIABLE

STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO CERTAIN COMPANY EXECUTIVES. THESE WERE CONSIDERED VARIABLE

GRANTS BECAUSE THE MEASUREMENT DATE WAS CONTINGENT UPON FUTURE INCREASES IN THE

MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. NO VARIABLE STOCK OPTIONS ARE CURRENTLY

OUTSTANDING.

162

SINCE THE EXERCISE PRICE

OF OUR FIXED GRANTS EQUALS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK ON THE DAY THEY ARE

GRANTED, THERE GENERALLY IS NO RELATED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL

REPORTING PURPOSES. HOWEVER, DURING 2002 AND 2001, CERTAIN EXECUTIVES

OUTSTANDING OPTIONS BECAME SUBJECT TO ACCELERATED VESTING AND AN EXTENDED LIFE,

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE POLICY OR EMPLOYMENT

AGREEMENTS, AND WE RECORDED COMPENSATION COST OF $4 MILLION AND $16 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE ALSO RECORDED COMPENSATION EXPENSE (BENEFIT) ASSOCIATED

WITH OUR VARIABLE OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS OF $7 MILLION, $9 MILLION

AND $(8) MILLION IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

FIXED OPTION GRANTS

U.S.-BASED PLANS

OUR FIXED OPTION GRANTS FOR CERTAIN

U.S.-BASED EMPLOYEES AND OUTSIDE DIRECTORS GIVE THESE INDIVIDUALS THE RIGHT,

ONCE THOSE GRANTS ARE VESTED, TO BUY OUR STOCK AT THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DAY

THE OPTIONS WERE GRANTED. FIXED STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE STOCK INCENTIVE

PLAN ADOPTED BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN MAY 1994 (AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED AND

RESTATED) BECOME EXERCISABLE NO LESS THAN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT AND

MAY BE EXERCISED UP TO TEN YEARS AFTER GRANT DATE. OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER OUR

OPTION PLAN IN EFFECT PRIOR TO MAY 1994 MAY BE EXERCISED AT ANY TIME UP TO

10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. AT THE END OF 2003, APPROXIMATELY 8.9 MILLION

SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER OUR STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN.

NON-U.S. PLANS

IN THE PAST WE HAD SEPARATE STOCK

OPTION PLANS FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF OUR NON-U.S. BASED OPERATIONS. THE

OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THESE PLANS WERE PRICED AT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON

STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE. GENERALLY, THEY CAN BE EXERCISED FROM THREE TO 10

YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE.

GLOBAL STOCK OPTION PLAN (GSOP)

IN

THE PAST, WE HAD A SEPARATE FIXED STOCK OPTION PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES WHO WERE NOT

ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED.

OPTIONS GRANTED TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES UNDER THE GSOP WERE CONTINGENT UPON THE

COMPANY ACHIEVING THRESHOLD LEVELS OF PROFITABILITY, AND THE LEVEL OF

PROFITABILITY ACHIEVED DETERMINED THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED. GENERALLY,

OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN CAN BE EXERCISED FROM THREE TO 10 YEARS AFTER

THE GRANT DATE. ALTHOUGH OPTIONS WERE GRANTED UNDER THIS PLAN IN 2001 AND 2000,

THE COMPANY NO LONGER EXPECTS TO ISSUE GRANTS UNDER THIS PLAN.

RESTRICTED STOCK

AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS

UP TO 20% OF THE 33.4 MILLION SHARES AUTHORIZED UNDER

OUR 1994 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN MAY BE GRANTED AS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS. THE

STOCK FOR THIS TYPE OF AWARD IS RESTRICTED BECAUSE RECIPIENTS RECEIVE THE STOCK

ONLY UPON COMPLETING A SPECIFIED OBJECTIVE OR PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT, GENERALLY

ONE TO FIVE YEARS. THE SHARES ARE CONSIDERED ISSUED WHEN AWARDED, BUT THE

RECIPIENT DOES NOT OWN AND CANNOT SELL THE SHARES DURING THE RESTRICTION PERIOD.

DURING THE RESTRICTION PERIOD, THE RECIPIENT RECEIVES COMPENSATION IN AN AMOUNT

EQUIVALENT TO THE DIVIDENDS PAID ON SUCH SHARES. UP TO 5.3 MILLION SHARES WERE

AVAILABLE FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

IN 2002 WE IMPLEMENTED THE CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PLAN. UNDER

THIS PLAN ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES MAY RECEIVE UP TO 25% OF THEIR ANNUAL BONUS IN THE

FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY PROVIDES A MATCHING

CONTRIBUTION OF RESTRICTED STOCK AT A 10 PERCENT DISCOUNT FROM THE MARKET PRICE

ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE RESTRICTED STOCK IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO A TWO-YEAR

VESTING PERIOD. PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROGRAM IS VOLUNTARY UNLESS AN EMPLOYEES

ANNUALIZED BASE PAY IS GREATER THAN $100,000, IS NOT RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE AND

WILL NOT BECOME RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THE DATE THE BONUS WAS

PAID. THE PERFORMANCE YEAR TO BE MEASURED IS THE CURRENT YEAR, WITH EXPENSE

BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE SUBSEQUENT TWO YEARS. FOR THE 2003 PERFORMANCE YEAR

GRANTS, $10.2 MILLION OF EXPENSE WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE TWO-YEAR VESTING

PERIOD, BEGINNING IN 2004. FOR THE 2002 PERFORMANCE YEAR GRANTS, $4.4 MILLION

OF EXPENSE WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN 2004.

WE ALSO HAVE A DEFERRED STOCK AWARD PLAN FOR STOCK

AWARDS TO NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES. DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS ARE THE SAME AS RESTRICTED

STOCK AWARDS, EXCEPT THAT SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE DEFERRED PLAN ARE NOT ISSUED

UNTIL THE VESTING CONDITIONS SPECIFIED IN THE AWARD ARE FULFILLED. UP TO 3,000

SHARES WERE AVAILABLE FOR DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

ANY OUTSTANDING UNVESTED RESTRICTED SHARES GRANTED IN

2003 AND PRIOR UNDER OUR U.S. PLAN WILL IMMEDIATELY VEST UPON CONSUMMATION OF

THE PROPOSED MERGER, WHICH CONSTITUTES A CHANGE IN CONTROL AS DEFINED BY THE

PLAN.

PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 1 FOR

THE PRO FORMA INFORMATION ON STOCK OPTION GRANTS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE

METHOD AS DESCRIBED IN SFAS NO. 123.

15   REINSURANCE

THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF OUR CEDED REINSURANCE PROGRAM,

INCLUDING THE AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS COVERAGES DISCUSSED BELOW, IS TO PROTECT

US FROM POTENTIAL LOSSES IN EXCESS OF WHAT WE ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT. WE EXPECT

THE COMPANIES TO WHICH WE HAVE CEDED REINSURANCE TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS. IN

THE EVENT THESE COMPANIES ARE UNABLE TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US, WE WILL

PAY THESE AMOUNTS. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED ALLOWANCES FOR POSSIBLE NONPAYMENT OF

AMOUNTS DUE TO US. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, OUR PROVISION FOR

UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE TOTALED $134 MILLION AND $122 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

WE REPORT BALANCES PERTAINING TO REINSURANCE

TRANSACTIONS GROSS ON THE BALANCE SHEET, MEANING THAT REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES ON UNPAID LOSSES AND CEDED UNEARNED PREMIUMS ARE NOT DEDUCTED FROM

INSURANCE RESERVES BUT ARE RECORDED AS ASSETS.

THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF OUR TOTAL REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES AND CEDED UNEARNED PREMIUMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002 WAS

WITH GENERAL REINSURANCE CORPORATION (GEN RE). GEN RE (WITH APPROXIMATELY 17%

AND 19% OF OUR RECOVERABLES AT THE END OF 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY) IS RATED

A+ + BY A.M. BEST, AAA BY MOODYS AND AAA BY STANDARD &

POORS FOR ITS FINANCIAL STRENGTH. APPROXIMATELY 6% OF OUR REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES AND CEDED UNEARNED PREMIUMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WERE WITH

PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD.

165

APPROXIMATELY 94% OF OUR DOMESTIC REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLE BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WERE WITH REINSURANCE COMPANIES

HAVING FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS OF A- OR HIGHER BY A.M BEST OR STANDARD &

POORS, WERE FROM STATE SPONSORED FACILITIES OR REINSURANCE POOLS, OR WERE

COLLATERALIZED REINSURANCE PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF OUR INSURANCE

OPERATIONS. WE HAVE AN INTERNAL CREDIT SECURITY COMMITTEE, WHICH USES A

COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT RISK REVIEW PROCESS IN SELECTING OUR REINSURERS. THIS

PROCESS CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS RATINGS BY MAJOR RATINGS AGENCIES, FINANCIAL

CONDITION, PARENTAL SUPPORT, OPERATING PRACTICES, AND MARKET NEWS AND

DEVELOPMENTS. THE CREDIT SECURITY COMMITTEE CONVENES QUARTERLY TO EVALUATE

THESE FACTORS AND TAKE ACTION ON OUR APPROVED LIST OF REINSURERS, AS NECESSARY.

AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE

TREATIES

IN 2001, WE ENTERED INTO TWO AGGREGATE

EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE REINSURANCE

TREATIES, WE TRANSFERRED, OR CEDED, INSURANCE LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES TO OUR REINSURERS, ALONG WITH THE RELATED WRITTEN AND EARNED PREMIUMS.

ONE OF THESE TREATIES WAS CORPORATE-WIDE, WITH COVERAGE TRIGGERED WHEN OUR

INSURANCE LOSSES AND LAE ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS REACHED A CERTAIN LEVEL,

AS PRESCRIBED BY TERMS OF THE TREATY. WE DID NOT CEDE ANY LOSSES TO THE

CORPORATE TREATY IN 2001, BUT WE RECORDED A $34 MILLION NET DETRIMENT IN 2001

RELATED TO A SIMILAR TREATY WE WERE PARTY TO IN 2000, PRIMARILY DUE TO

ADJUSTMENTS FOR CESSIONS MADE IN 2000.  WE WERE NOT PARTY TO SUCH A TREATY IN 2003 OR

2002. OUR REINSURANCE OPERATION WAS PARTY TO A SEPARATE AGGREGATE

EXCESS-OF-LOSS TREATY IN 2002 AND 2001. THE RESULTS OF OUR REINSURANCE

OPERATION IN 2002 AND 2001 INCLUDED A $34 MILLION DETRIMENT AND A $159 MILLION

BENEFIT, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THOSE TREATIES. THE DETRIMENT IN 2002

PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE COMMUTATION OF A PORTION OF THE 2001 TREATY. WE DID

NOT CEDE ANY LOSSES TO OUR REINSURANCE OPERATIONS 2002 EXCESS-OF-LOSS TREATY. THE

2001 BENEFIT RESULTED FROM LOSSES CEDED TO THE 2001 TREATY.

THE

EFFECT OF ASSUMED AND CEDED REINSURANCE ON PREMIUMS WRITTEN, PREMIUMS EARNED

AND INSURANCE LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS AS FOLLOWS (INCLUDING THE

IMPACT OF THE REINSURANCE TREATIES).

INVESTMENTS IN ST. PAUL VENTURE CAPITAL VI, LLC (FUND VI), ONE OF OUR

166

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT SUBSIDIARIES. ADDITIONAL

AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO FUND NEW AND EXISTING INVESTMENTS IN

PARTNERSHIPS AND CERTAIN OTHER VENTURE CAPITAL ENTITIES. OUR FUTURE OBLIGATIONS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 ARE ESTIMATED AS FOLLOWS.

GENERALLY, WE EXPECT THAT OUR OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE THE

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS LISTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE WILL BE LARGELY FUNDED BY

DISTRIBUTIONS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF NEW CAPITAL WE ARE OBLIGATED TO CONTRIBUTE TO SATISFY THOSE

OBLIGATIONS TO FUND VI IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY OFFSETTING

DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR VENTURE CAPITAL OPERATION IS $250 MILLION AND, ON A

CUMULATIVE BASIS OVER THE LIFE OF FUND VI, NO MORE THAN $325 MILLION. IN

ADDITION, WE CAN ELECT TO DISCONTINUE FUNDING FUND VI AT ANY TIME. IF WE DO SO,

WE MUST CONTRIBUTE $250 MILLION (NOT REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE) TO A

TERMINATION FUND AND PAY CERTAIN TERMINATION AND MANAGEMENT FEES. ALTERNATIVELY,

ONCE 70% OF THE FUND VI CAPITAL HAS BEEN COMMITTED, WE MUST ELECT EITHER TO

COMMIT A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO A NEW VENTURE CAPITAL FUND OR

AGREE TO CONTRIBUTE AN ADDITIONAL $150 MILLION (NOT REFLECTED IN THE TABLE

ABOVE) TO FUND VI.

LETTERS OF CREDIT

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE

ENTER INTO LETTERS OF CREDIT AS COLLATERAL, AS REQUIRED IN CERTAIN OF OUR

OPERATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE HAD ENTERED INTO LETTERS OF CREDIT

WITH AN AGGREGATE FACE VALUE OF $944 MILLION.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

IS CONDUCTED IN RENTED PREMISES. WE ALSO ENTER INTO LEASES FOR EQUIPMENT, SUCH

AS OFFICE MACHINES AND COMPUTERS. OUR TOTAL RENTAL EXPENSE WAS $96 MILLION IN

2003, $86 MILLION IN 2002 AND $83 MILLION IN 2001. CERTAIN LEASES ARE

NONCANCELABLE, AND WE WOULD REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT EVEN IF WE STOPPED

USING THE SPACE OR EQUIPMENT. ON DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE MINIMUM RENTS FOR

WHICH WE WOULD BE LIABLE UNDER THESE TYPES OF LEASES ARE AS FOLLOWS: $113

MILLION IN 2004, $89 MILLION IN 2005, $76 MILLION IN 2006, $67 MILLION IN 2007,

$60 MILLION IN 2008 AND $102 MILLION THEREAFTER. WE ARE ALSO THE LESSOR UNDER

VARIOUS SUBLEASES ON OUR OFFICE FACILITIES. THE MINIMUM RENTALS TO BE RECEIVED

UNDER NONCANCELABLE SUBLEASES ARE AS FOLLOWS.

$19 MILLION IN 2004, $16 MILLION IN 2005, $15 MILLION IN 2006, $12

MILLION IN 2007, $12 MILLION IN 2008 AND $14 MILLION THEREAFTER.

ACQUISITION OF SYMPHONY

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2003

,

OUR

ASSET MANAGEMENT SUBSIDIARY, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INC., MAY BE REQUIRED TO

MAKE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS OF UP TO $121 MILLION RELATED TO THEIR ACQUISITION OF

SYMPHONY, BASED ON SYMPHONY REACHING SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE AND GROWTH TARGETS. ANY

FUTURE PAYMENTS WILL BE RECORDED AS ADDITIONAL GOODWILL.

ACQUISITION

OF RENEWAL RIGHTS

IN MAY 2003, WE ENTERED INTO A

CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AGREEMENT AS PART OF OUR PURCHASE PRICE OF THE RIGHT

TO SEEK TO RENEW CERTAIN BUSINESS FROM KEMPER INSURANCE COMPANIES (KEMPER). WE

ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT IN JUNE 2004 BASED ON THE

AMOUNT OF PREMIUM VOLUME WE ULTIMATELY RENEW DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS

SUBSEQUENT TO THIS PURCHASE. WE BELIEVE IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT ANY ADDITIONAL

PAYMENT WOULD EXCEED $30 MILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE HAD ACCRUED $10

MILLION TOWARD THIS ADDITIONAL OBLIGATION, RECORDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES.

SALE OF MINET

IN MAY 1997, WE COMPLETED THE

SALE OF OUR INSURANCE BROKERAGE OPERATION, MINET, TO AON CORPORATION. WE AGREED

TO INDEMNIFY AON AGAINST ANY FUTURE CLAIMS FOR PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND

167

OTHER

SPECIFIED EVENTS THAT OCCURRED OR EXISTED PRIOR TO THE SALE. WE MONITOR OUR

EXPOSURE UNDER THESE CLAIMS ON A REGULAR BASIS. WE BELIEVE RESERVES FOR REPORTED

CLAIMS ARE ADEQUATE, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE INFORMATION ON UNREPORTED CLAIMS TO

ESTIMATE A RANGE OF ADDITIONAL LIABILITY. WE PURCHASED INSURANCE TO COVER A

PORTION OF OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH CLAIMS. UNDER THE SALE AGREEMENT, WE ALSO

COMMITTED TO PAY AON COMMISSIONS REPRESENTING A MINIMUM LEVEL OF ANNUAL

REINSURANCE BROKERAGE BUSINESS THROUGH 2012. THE MAXIMUM ANNUAL AMOUNT PAYABLE

TO AON RELATED TO THAT COMMITMENT IS $20 MILLION. WE ALSO HAVE COMMITMENTS

UNDER LEASE AGREEMENTS THROUGH 2015 FOR VACATED SPACE (INCLUDED IN OUR LEASE

COMMITMENT TOTALS ABOVE), AS WELL AS A COMMITMENT TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO A FORMER

MINET EXECUTIVE.

SALE

OF CAMPERDOWN UK

IN

DECEMBER 2003, WE SOLD OUR LONDON SUBSIDIARY, CAMPERDOWN UK. AS PART OF

THAT SALE, WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER IN THE EVENT A SPECIFIED

RESERVE DEFICIENCY DEVELOPS, A RESERVE-RELATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACT OCCURS,

OR A FOREIGN TAX ADJUSTMENT IS IMPOSED ON A PRE-SALE REPORTING PERIOD. THE

MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THIS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION IS $203 MILLION, AND IS

INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL SALES OF BUSINESS ENTITIES REPORTED BELOW. WE RECORDED

A FAIR VALUE OF $24 MILLION IN OTHER LIABILITIES FOR THIS INDEMNIFICATION. ALL

OTHER GUARANTEES RELATED TO THIS SALE ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL SALES OF

BUSINESS ENTITIES REPORTED BELOW. AT LLOYDS, WE UNDERWRITE BUSINESS THROUGH A

SINGLE SYNDICATE (SYNDICATE 5000) FOR WHICH WE PROVIDE 100% OF THE CAPITAL. IN

2003, FIRE AND MARINE ENTERED INTO A 100% QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT

DIRECTLY WITH SYNDICATE 5000 THAT IN EFFECT TRANSFERRED SYNDICATE 5000S

UNDERWRITING RESULTS FOR THE 2003 YEAR OF ACCOUNT TO FIRE AND MARINE.

JOINT

VENTURES

OUR

SUBSIDIARY, FIRE AND MARINE, IS A PARTY TO FIVE SEPARATE JOINT VENTURES, IN

EACH OF WHICH FIRE AND MARINE IS A 50% OWNER OF VARIOUS REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS

AND DOES NOT EXERCISE CONTROL OVER THE JOINT VENTURES, FINANCED BY NON-RECOURSE

MORTGAGE NOTES. BECAUSE WE OWN ONLY 50% OF THE HOLDINGS, WE DO NOT CONSOLIDATE

THESE ENTITIES AND THE JOINT VENTURE DEBT DOES NOT APPEAR ON OUR BALANCE SHEET.

OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER EACH OF THESE JOINT VENTURES, IN THE EVENT OF

FORECLOSURE OF A PROPERTY, IS LIMITED TO OUR CARRYING VALUE IN THE JOINT

VENTURE, RANGING INDIVIDUALLY FROM $6 MILLION TO $27 MILLION, AND

CUMULATIVELY TOTALING $58 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

STRUCTURED

SETTLEMENTS

CERTAIN SETTLEMENTS OF CLAIMS UNDER WORKERS

COMPENSATION AND OTHER LIABILITY POLICIES INVOLVE PERIODIC PAYMENTS TO A

CLAIMANT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, USUALLY FUNDED THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF AN

ANNUITY FROM A THIRD PARTY. AS OUR PRIMARY OBLIGATION TO PAY HAS BEEN

TRANSFERRED TO A THIRD PARTY, OUR HISTORICAL PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO TREAT ALL

STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS AS EXTINGUISHING OUR LIABILITY TO THE POLICYHOLDER,

ALTHOUGH IN SOME CASES WE REMAIN CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF ANY

DEFAULTS BY THE COMPANIES ISSUING THE ANNUITIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003,

THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS FOR WHICH WE REMAIN

CONTINGENTLY LIABLE WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.59 BILLION.

LEGAL

MATTERS

IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS, WE (AND CERTAIN OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES) HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN VARIOUS LAWSUITS. SOME OF THESE

LAWSUITS ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH LIABILITY UNDER INSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED BY OUR

UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS

,

INCLUDING LIABILITY

UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS AND FOR INJURY CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO

ASBESTOS PRODUCTS. PLAINTIFFS IN THESE LAWSUITS ARE SEEKING MONEY DAMAGES THAT

IN SOME CASES ARE SUBSTANTIAL OR EXTRA CONTRACTUAL IN NATURE OR ARE SEEKING TO

HAVE THE COURT DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN WAYS.

ALTHOUGH THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS NOT

PRESENTLY DETERMINABLE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE RESOLUTION OF ONE OR MORE MATTERS

MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

THE TOTAL AMOUNTS THAT WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE TO PAY IN

ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY OR OVERALL

FINANCIAL POSITION.

168

THE FOLLOWING IS A

SUMMARY OF CERTAIN LITIGATION MATTERS WITH CONTINGENCIES.

·

ASBESTOS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

ON JUNE 3, 2002, WE ANNOUNCED

THAT WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT SETTLING

ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE CLAIMS ARISING FROM ANY INSURING RELATIONSHIP OF UNITED

STATES FIDELITY AND GUARANTY COMPANY, ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE

COMPANY AND THEIR AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING US, WITH ANY OF

MACARTHUR COMPANY, WESTERN MACARTHUR COMPANY, AND WESTERN ASBESTOS COMPANY. IN JANUARY 2004,

THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ISSUED AN

ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES, AND

CONFIRMING THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION.  SEE DISCUSSION IN NOTE 20.

·

PETROBRAS OIL RIG CONSTRUCTION

IN SEPTEMBER 2002, THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ENTERED A JUDGMENT

IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $370 MILLION TO PETROBRAS, AN ENERGY COMPANY

THAT IS MAJORITY-OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF BRAZIL, IN A CLAIM RELATED TO THE

CONSTRUCTION OF TWO OIL RIGS. ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDED A PORTION OF THE

SURETY COVERAGE FOR THAT CONSTRUCTION. AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A PRETAX LOSS

OF $34 MILLION ($22 MILLION AFTER-TAX) IN 2002 IN OUR SURETY &

CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE LOSS RECORDED WAS NET OF REINSURANCE AND

PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED CASE RESERVES FOR THIS EXPOSURE, AND PRIOR TO ANY

POSSIBLE RECOVERIES RELATED TO INDEMNITY. WE CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY PURSUE AN

APPEAL OF THIS JUDGMENT.

·

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002,

SEVERAL PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER, OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND US. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE

LAWSUITS WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE ACTION, WHICH MAKES VARIOUS

ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PREVIOUS PUBLIC DISCLOSURES AND

RESERVES RELATING TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION, AND SEEKS

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, WE AGREED

IN PRINCIPLE TO A SETTLEMENT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CUSTOMARY CONDITIONS

AND SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL. IF THE SETTLEMENT IS CONSUMMATED, IT WILL RESULT

IN OUR PAYMENT OF AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

·

BOSON V. UNION CARBIDE

CORP., ET AL; ABERNATHY V. ACE AMERICAN INS. CO

IN 2003, LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN

TEXAS AND OHIO AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AND OTHER INSURERS AND

NON-INSURER CORPORATE DEFENDANTS, ASSERTING LIABILITY FOR FAILING TO WARN OF

THE DANGERS OF ASBESTOS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME FOR FINANCIAL

EXPOSURE REPRESENTED BY THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION IN LIGHT OF THE BROAD NATURE OF

THE RELIEF REQUESTED AND THE NOVEL THEORIES ASSERTED. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT

THE CASES ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND WE INTEND TO CONTEST THEM VIGOROUSLY. IN THIS

REGARD, WE FILED SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS IN ALL OF THE TEXAS CASES. IN OCTOBER 2003,

A COURT RULED ON THE SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS IN 11 OF THOSE CASES, DISMISSING THE

CASES WITH PREJUDICE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COURT DISMISSED ANOTHER CASE ON THE

SAME GROUNDS. WE VIEW THESE AS SIGNIFICANT RULINGS IN OUR FAVOR. THE SPECIAL

EXCEPTIONS IN THE REMAINING 50 CASES HAVE NOT YET BEEN RULED UPON. WE INTEND TO

FILE SIMILAR MOTIONS TO DISMISS IN THE OHIO CASES.

·

WORLD TRADE CENTER LITIGATION

IN 2002, WE AND CERTAIN OTHER

INSURERS OBTAINED A SUMMARY JUDGMENT RULING THAT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER (WTC)

PROPERTY LOSS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 WAS A SINGLE OCCURRENCE. CERTAIN

INSUREDS, INCLUDING THE WTCS LEASEHOLDER, APPEALED THAT RULING, ASKING THE

COURT TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROPERTY LOSS CONSTITUTED TWO SEPARATE OCCURRENCES

RATHER THAN ONE. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE U.S. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE SECOND CIRCUIT RULED THAT UNDER TERMS OF THE POLICY FORM WE USED TO

UNDERWRITE PROPERTY COVERAGE FOR THE WTC, THE TERRORIST ATTACK CONSTITUTED ONE

OCCURRENCE.

·

FARINA V. TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., ET AL



A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION WAS

RECENTLY FILED IN CONNECTICUT STATE COURT AGAINST TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY

CORP. AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALLEGING THAT THEY BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY

DUTIES TO TRAVELERS SHAREHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER

AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS INJUNCTIVE

RELIEF

169

AS WELL AS UNSPECIFIED

MONETARY DAMAGES. THE COMPLAINT ALSO NAMES THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARY ADAMS

ACQUISITION CORP. AS DEFENDANTS, ALLEGING THAT THEY AIDED AND ABETTED THE

ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. WE BELIEVE THIS SUIT IS WHOLLY WITHOUT MERIT

AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST IT.

GUARANTEES

AGENCY

LOANS



WE HAVE PROVIDED GUARANTEES FOR

CERTAIN AGENCY LOANS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND

OPPORTUNITIES OF SEVERAL OF THE INSURANCE AGENCIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THESE LOANS HAD AN AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF

APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION. WE HAVE GUARANTEED THE LENDING INSTITUTIONS THAT WE

WILL PAY UP TO THE ENTIRE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING IN CASE OF ANY AGENCY

DEFAULTS, PLUS ANY REASONABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEFAULT. THERE ARE

VARYING TERMS ON THE LOANS, AND THE GUARANTEES ARE IN PLACE UNTIL THE LOANS ARE

PAID IN FULL.

CORPORATE

SECURITIES



THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF OUR DEBT

SECURITIES, WE HAVE GUARANTEED TO INDEMNIFY THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AGAINST ANY

LOSS, LIABILITY, CLAIM, DAMAGE, OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING TAXES THAT MAY ARISE OUT

OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEBT ARRANGEMENT. THERE ARE NO CONTRACTUAL

MONETARY LIMITS PLACED ON THESE GUARANTEES, AND THEY SURVIVE UNTIL THE

APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATION EXPIRE.

VENTURE

CAPITAL



OUR SUBSIDIARY, ST. PAUL VENTURE

CAPITAL VI, LLC HAS GUARANTEED THIRD PARTY LOANS IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF

APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION. IN THE EVENT THAT THE BORROWER WOULD DEFAULT, ST.

PAUL VENTURE CAPITAL HAS GUARANTEED PAYMENT UP TO THE AFOREMENTIONED LIMITS,

PLUS ANY COSTS, FEES, AND EXPENSES THAT THE LENDING INSTITUTION MIGHT INCUR IN

THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEFAULT ON THE LOANS. THESE GUARANTEES ARE IN PLACE

UNTIL THE LOANS ARE PAID IN FULL.

SWAP

AGREEMENTS



WE ARE PARTY TO A NUMBER OF

INTEREST RATE SWAPS. EACH PARTY TO A STANDARD SWAP AGREEMENT AGREES TO

INDEMNIFY THE OTHER FOR TAX LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF THE SWAP

TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE NO WAY TO VALUE THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY OR ASSET THAT MAY

ARISE DUE TO THESE TAX ISSUES, AND THERE ARE NO CONTRACTUAL MONETARY LIMITS

PLACED ON THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS.

PLATINUM

TRANSACTION



IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLATINUM

TRANSACTION, (SEE NOTE 19) WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF SERVICING AGREEMENTS

WITH PLATINUM RELATING TO THE TRANSFER OF OUR 2002 REINSURANCE BUSINESS. SUCH

AGREEMENTS PROVIDE GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS ON EACH OF THE PARTIES

WITH RESPECT TO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS MADE UNDER THE TERMS

OF EACH OF THE AGREEMENTS. GENERALLY, THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF EACH

PARTY ARE CAPPED AT THE AGGREGATE OF ALL FEES RECEIVED BY EACH PARTY. THESE

INDEMNIFICATIONS SURVIVE UNTIL THE APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATION EXPIRE. IN

ADDITION, WE AGREED TO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION TO PLATINUM AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES FOR LOSSES INCURRED DUE TO INACCURATE OR

OMITTED INFORMATION IN CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE PLATINUM REGISTRATION STATEMENTS

AND PROSPECTUSES USED IN CONNECTION WITH PLATINUMS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF

SECURITIES, OR THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM USED IN CONNECTION WITH

PLATINUMS PRIVATE OFFERING OF SECURITIES TO RENAISSANCE REINSURANCE. WE ALSO

AGREED TO MAKE CERTAIN PAYMENTS TO THE UNDERWRITERS OF THE PLATINUM PUBLIC

OFFERINGS IF PLATINUM FAILS TO SATISFY CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS TO

THEM IN SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR OBLIGATIONS PURSUANT TO THESE INDEMNITIES

HAVE AN AGGREGATE LIMIT OF $400 MILLION, WHICH AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED BY ANY

PAYMENTS WE MAKE TO INVESTORS IN THE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERINGS. THE

OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY PLATINUM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES

EXPIRES ON NOVEMBER 1, 2004.

SALES

OF BUSINESS ENTITIES



IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF SELLING

BUSINESS ENTITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY PURCHASERS FOR

LOSSES ARISING OUT OF BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT

TO THE BUSINESS ENTITIES BEING SOLD, COVENANTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF US AND/OR OUR

SUBSIDIARIES FOLLOWING THE CLOSING, AND IN CERTAIN CASES OBLIGATIONS ARISING

FROM UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES, ADVERSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, PREMIUM DEFICIENCIES

OR CERTAIN NAMED LITIGATION. SUCH INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS GENERALLY SURVIVE

FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE APPLICABLE CLOSING DATE TO THE

EXPIRATION OF THE RELEVANT STATUTES OF LIMITATION, OR IN SOME CASES AGREED UPON

TERM LIMITATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003,

170

THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF

OUR QUANTIFIABLE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN EFFECT FOR SALES OF BUSINESS

ENTITIES WAS $2.2 BILLION, WITH A DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT OF $72 MILLION. THE

DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT REPRESENTS AN AGGREGATE MINIMUM THRESHOLD WHICH OUR

OBLIGATIONS MUST EXCEED BEFORE WE WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION

TO THIRD PARTY PURCHASERS FOR CERTAIN LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH SOLD BUSINESS ENTITIES

THAT ARE NOT LIMITED BY A CONTRACTUAL MONETARY AMOUNT. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003, WE HAD OUTSTANDING UNLIMITED INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION

WITH THE SALES OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR TAX LIABILITIES ARISING

PRIOR TO A PURCHASERS OWNERSHIP OF AN ENTITY, LOSSES ARISING OUT OF EMPLOYEE

MATTERS RELATING TO ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF SUCH BUSINESS ENTITY OR US PRIOR TO

THE CLOSING, LOSSES RESULTING OUT OF SUCH SOLD BUSINESS ENTITIES BEING DEEMED

PART OF THE ST. PAUL GROUP PRIOR TO THEIR RESPECTIVE SALES TO THIRD PARTIES FOR

PURPOSES OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 412 OR TITLE IV OF ERISA, AND IN

SOME CASES LOSSES ARISING FROM CERTAIN LITIGATION AND UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. THESE

INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SURVIVE UNTIL THE APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATION

EXPIRE, OR UNTIL THE AGREED UPON CONTRACT TERMS EXPIRE.

OTHER



WE HAVE GUARANTEED

TO INDEMNIFY THE HOLDERS OF THE MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE TRUST PREFERRED

SECURITIES IN THE EVENT THOSE TRUSTS DEFAULT. THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THAT

OBLIGATION IS INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

17

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

LIFE

INSURANCE



IN SEPTEMBER 2001, WE

COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, FIDELITY AND GUARANTY LIFE

INSURANCE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARY, THOMAS JEFFERSON LIFE (TOGETHER, F&G

LIFE) TO OLD MUTUAL PLC (OLD MUTUAL), FOR $335 MILLION IN CASH AND $300

MILLION IN ORDINARY SHARES OF OLD MUTUAL. IN JUNE 2002, WE SOLD ALL OF THE

OLD MUTUAL SHARES WE WERE HOLDING FOR A TOTAL NET CONSIDERATION OF $287

MILLION, RESULTING IN A PRETAX REALIZED LOSS OF $13 MILLION THAT WAS RECORDED

AS A COMPONENT OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ON OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN

2002. AT THE TIME OF THE SALE OF THE OLD MUTUAL SHARES, THERE WAS A DERIVATIVE COLLAR

AGREEMENT IN PLACE THAT WOULD HAVE DETERMINED ANY POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE

ORIGINAL F&G LIFE SALE PRICE ONE YEAR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.  THE COLLAR WAS RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET

AS AN ASSET AND HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $12 MILLION WHEN WE SOLD OUR OLD MUTUAL

SHARES. WE AGREED TO TERMINATE THE COLLAR AT NO VALUE AS PART OF THE SALE OF

OUR OLD MUTUAL SHARES. THAT $12 MILLION PRETAX LOSS WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ON OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN 2002.

AT THE TIME OF THE SALE OF F&G LIFE IN 2001, WE

RECORDED A NET AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $74 MILLION ON THE SALE PROCEEDS. THAT LOSS

WAS COMBINED WITH F&G LIFES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRIOR TO SALE FOR AN

AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $55 MILLION AND WAS INCLUDED IN THE REPORTED LOSS FROM

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001.

IN SEPTEMBER 2001, WE SOLD AMERICAN CONTINENTAL

LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, A SMALL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY WE HAD ACQUIRED AS PART

OF OUR MMI PURCHASE, TO CNA FINANCIAL CORPORATION. WE RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS OF

$21 MILLION, AND RECORDED A NET AFTER-TAX LOSS ON THE SALE OF

$1 MILLION.

STANDARD

PERSONAL INSURANCE



IN 1999, WE SOLD OUR STANDARD

PERSONAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS TO METROPOLITAN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

COMPANY (METROPOLITAN). METROPOLITAN PURCHASED ECONOMY FIRE &

CASUALTY COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (ECONOMY), AND THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN

THOSE NON-ECONOMY POLICIES CONSTITUTING THE REMAINDER OF OUR STANDARD PERSONAL

INSURANCE OPERATIONS. THOSE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS WERE TRANSFERRED TO

METROPOLITAN BY WAY OF A REINSURANCE AND FACILITY AGREEMENT. WE GUARANTEED THE

ADEQUACY OF ECONOMYS LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVES, AND WE REMAIN LIABLE FOR

CLAIMS ON NON-ECONOMY POLICIES THAT RESULT FROM LOSSES OCCURRING PRIOR TO THE SEPTEMBER 30,

1999 CLOSING DATE. UNDER THE RESERVE-RELATED AGREEMENTS, WE AGREED TO PAY FOR

ANY DEFICIENCIES IN THOSE RESERVES AND WOULD SHARE IN ANY REDUNDANCIES THAT

DEVELOPED BY SEPTEMBER 30, 2002. ANY LOSSES INCURRED BY US UNDER THESE

AGREEMENTS WERE REFLECTED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH

THEY WERE INCURRED. AT

171

DECEMBER 31, 2002,

OUR ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT WE OWED METROPOLITAN $13 MILLION RELATED TO THE

RESERVE AGREEMENTS, WHICH WAS PAID IN APRIL 2003. WE HAVE NO OTHER

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATED TO THIS SALE.

NONSTANDARD

AUTO INSURANCE



PRUDENTIAL PURCHASED OUR

NONSTANDARD AUTO INSURANCE BUSINESS MARKETED UNDER THE VICTORIA FINANCIAL AND

TITAN AUTO BRANDS FOR $175 MILLION IN CASH (NET OF A $25 MILLION DIVIDEND PAID

BY THESE OPERATIONS TO OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OPERATIONS PRIOR TO

CLOSING). WE RECORDED AN ESTIMATED AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $83 MILLION ON THE SALE IN

1999, REPRESENTING THE ESTIMATED EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ENTITIES AT

CLOSING DATE OVER PROCEEDS TO BE RECEIVED FROM THE SALE, PLUS ESTIMATED INCOME

THROUGH THE DISPOSAL DATE. THIS EXCESS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF GOODWILL. WE

RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF $9 MILLION IN 2000, PRIMARILY

REPRESENTING ADDITIONAL LOSSES INCURRED THROUGH THE DISPOSAL DATE IN MAY, AND

AN ADDITIONAL AFTER-TAX LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF $5 MILLION IN 2001, PRIMARILY

REPRESENTING TAX ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE SALE TRANSACTION.

MINET



IN 1997, WE SOLD OUR

INSURANCE BROKERAGE OPERATION, MINET HOLDINGS PLC (MINET) TO AON CORPORATION.

WE RECORDED EXPENSES IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS

RELATED TO THE MINET SALE. IN 2003, THE EXPENSE RECORDED PRIMARILY REPRESENTED

AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE TAX PROVISION ON THE SALE, WHEREAS THE EXPENSES RECORDED

IN 2002 AND 2001 PRIMARILY REPRESENTED ADDITIONAL FUNDS DUE AON PURSUANT TO

PROVISIONS OF THE SALE AGREEMENT.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR LIFE

INSURANCE BUSINESS, OUR STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCE BUSINESS, OUR NONSTANDARD

AUTO BUSINESS AND OUR INSURANCE BROKERAGE BUSINESS, MINET (SOLD IN 1997), FOR EACH

YEAR IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003.

AND OTHER CHARGES

DECEMBER

2001 STRATEGIC

REVIEW

IN DECEMBER 2001, WE ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF A

STRATEGIC REVIEW OF ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDED A DECISION TO EXIT

ALL BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN OUR HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS, NARROW THE PRODUCT

OFFERINGS OF OUR REINSURANCE OPERATION, EXIT CERTAIN BUSINESS AT LLOYDS AND

CEASE TO UNDERWRITE BUSINESS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES WHERE WE WERE UNLIKELY TO

ACHIEVE COMPETITIVE SCALE. RELATED TO THIS STRATEGIC REVIEW, WE WROTE OFF $73

MILLION OF GOODWILL, AND WE RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE OF $62 MILLION, INCLUDING

$46 MILLION OF EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS, $9 MILLION OF OCCUPANCY-RELATED COSTS,

172

$4 MILLION OF

EQUIPMENT CHARGES AND $3 MILLION OF LEGAL COSTS. THE $62 MILLION PRETAX CHARGE

WAS INCLUDED IN OPERATING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR 2001 STATEMENT

OF OPERATIONS; WITH $42 MILLION INCLUDED IN PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCEOTHER

AND $20 MILLION INCLUDED IN PARENT COMPANY, OTHER OPERATIONS AND CONSOLIDATING

ELIMINATIONS IN THE TABLE TITLED INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE IN NOTE 3 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS REPRESENT SEVERANCE AND

RELATED BENEFITS SUCH AS OUTPLACEMENT SERVICES TO BE PAID TO, OR INCURRED ON

BEHALF OF, EMPLOYEES TO BE TERMINATED BY THE END OF 2002. WE ESTIMATED THAT A

TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 1,200 EMPLOYEES WOULD ULTIMATELY BE TERMINATED UNDER

THIS ACTION, WITH APPROXIMATELY 800 EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO BE TERMINATED BY THE

END OF 2002. THE REMAINING 400 EMPLOYEES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE RESTRUCTURING

CHARGE SINCE THEY WOULD EITHER BE TERMINATED AFTER 2002 OR WERE PART OF ONE OF

THE OPERATIONS THAT WAS TO BE SOLD. OF THE TOTAL, APPROXIMATELY 650 WORKED IN

OFFICES OUTSIDE THE U.S. (SOME OF WHICH HAVE NOW BEEN CLOSED), APPROXIMATELY

300 WORKED IN OUR HEALTH CARE BUSINESS (WHICH WAS EXITED), AND THE REMAINING

250 WERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. A TOTAL OF 713 OF THE

ESTIMATED 800 POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED. THE REMAINING 87 POSITIONS REPRESENTED

EMPLOYEES WHO FOUND ALTERNATE POSITIONS WITHIN THE COMPANY OR EXTERNAL

EMPLOYMENT BEFORE TERMINATION.

THE OCCUPANCY-RELATED COST REPRESENTS EXCESS SPACE

CREATED BY THE TERMINATIONS, CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE ANTICIPATED EXCESS

SPACE, BY LOCATION, AS A RESULT OF THE TERMINATIONS. THE PERCENTAGE OF EXCESS

SPACE IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL LEASED SPACE WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE CURRENT

LEASE COSTS OVER THE REMAINING LEASE PERIOD. THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE

EXISTING LEASES WERE NOT DISCOUNTED, AND SUBLEASE INCOME WAS INCLUDED IN THE

CALCULATION ONLY FOR THOSE LOCATIONS WHERE SUBLEASE AGREEMENTS WERE IN PLACE. THE

EQUIPMENT COSTS REPRESENT THE NET BOOK VALUE OF COMPUTER AND OTHER EQUIPMENT

THAT WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEES AND CLOSING

OF OFFICES. THE LEGAL COSTS REPRESENTED OUR ESTIMATE OF FEES TO BE PAID TO

OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL TO EXIT CERTAIN STATES OR

COUNTRIES.

OTHER

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

SINCE 1997, WE HAVE RECORDED IN

CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOUR OTHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO ACTIONS TAKEN

TO IMPROVE OUR OPERATIONS.

RELATED TO OUR APRIL 2000 PURCHASE OF MMI, WE

RECORDED A CHARGE OF $28 MILLION, INCLUDING $4 MILLION OF EMPLOYEE-RELATED

COSTS AND $24 MILLION OF OCCUPANCY-RELATED COSTS. THE EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS

REPRESENTED SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFITS SUCH AS OUTPLACEMENT COUNSELING TO

BE PAID TO, OR INCURRED ON BEHALF OF, TERMINATED EMPLOYEES. WE ESTIMATED THAT

APPROXIMATELY 130 EMPLOYEE POSITIONS WOULD BE ELIMINATED, AT ALL LEVELS

THROUGHOUT MMI, AND 119 EMPLOYEES WERE TERMINATED. THE OCCUPANCY-RELATED COST

REPRESENTED EXCESS SPACE CREATED BY THE TERMINATIONS, CALCULATED BY DETERMINING

THE PERCENTAGE OF ANTICIPATED EXCESS SPACE, BY LOCATION, AND THE CURRENT LEASE

COSTS OVER THE REMAINING LEASE PERIOD. THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE EXISTING

LEASES WERE NOT DISCOUNTED, AND SUBLEASE INCOME WAS INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION

ONLY FOR THOSE LOCATIONS WHERE SUBLEASE AGREEMENTS WERE IN PLACE.

173

IN AUGUST 1999, WE ANNOUNCED A COST REDUCTION

PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ENHANCE OUR EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN A HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1999, WE RECORDED A PRETAX

CHARGE OF $60 MILLION RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM, INCLUDING $25 MILLION IN

EMPLOYEE-RELATED CHARGES RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 590

EMPLOYEES, $33 MILLION IN OCCUPANCY-RELATED CHARGES AND $2 MILLION IN EQUIPMENT

CHARGES.

LATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1998, WE RECORDED A

PRETAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $34 MILLION. THE MAJORITY OF THE CHARGE, $26

MILLION, RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 500 EMPLOYEES, PRIMARILY

IN OUR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS. THE REMAINING CHARGE OF $8 MILLION

RELATED TO COSTS TO BE INCURRED TO EXIT LEASE OBLIGATIONS.

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR MERGER WITH USF&G, IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 1998 WE RECORDED A PRETAX CHARGE TO NET INCOME OF $292

MILLION, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF SEVERANCE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS

RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 2,200 POSITIONS, FACILITIES EXIT

COSTS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND TRANSACTION COSTS.

ALL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND ALL OBLIGATIONS HAVE

BEEN MET REGARDING THESE OTHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

CERTAIN REMAINING LEASE COMMITMENTS. THE LEASE COMMITMENT CHARGES RELATED TO

EXCESS SPACE CREATED BY THE COST REDUCTION ACTIONS. THE CHARGE WAS CALCULATED

BY DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE OF ANTICIPATED EXCESS SPACE, BY LOCATION, AND THE

CURRENT LEASE COSTS OVER THE REMAINING LEASE PERIOD. THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER

THE EXISTING LEASES WERE NOT DISCOUNTED, AND SUBLEASE INCOME WAS INCLUDED IN

THE CALCULATION ONLY FOR THOSE LOCATIONS WHERE SUBLEASE AGREEMENTS WERE IN

PLACE.

WE

EXPECT TO BE OBLIGATED UNDER CERTAIN LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY

SIX YEARS. THE FOLLOWING PRESENTS A

TRANSFER OF ONGOING REINSURANCE

OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD.

ON NOVEMBER 1, 2002, WE COMPLETED THE TRANSFER OF

OUR CONTINUING REINSURANCE BUSINESS (PREVIOUSLY OPERATING UNDER THE NAME ST.

PAUL RE) AND CERTAIN RELATED ASSETS, INCLUDING RENEWAL RIGHTS, TO PLATINUM

UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD. (PLATINUM), A BERMUDA COMPANY FORMED IN 2002 THAT

UNDERWRITES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS.

AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION, WE CONTRIBUTED $122

MILLION OF CASH TO PLATINUM AND TRANSFERRED $349 MILLION IN ASSETS RELATING TO

THE INSURANCE RESERVES THAT WE ALSO TRANSFERRED. IN EXCHANGE, WE ACQUIRED SIX

MILLION COMMON SHARES, REPRESENTING A 14% EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

PLATINUM, AND A TEN-YEAR OPTION TO BUY UP TO SIX MILLION ADDITIONAL COMMON

SHARES AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $27 PER SHARE, WHICH REPRESENTS 120% OF THE

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF PLATINUMS SHARES.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRANSFER OF OUR CONTINUING

REINSURANCE BUSINESS TO PLATINUM, WE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS WITH

PLATINUM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS BY

WHICH PLATINUM REINSURED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ENTERED

INTO BY ST. PAUL RE ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2002. THIS TRANSFER (BASED ON SEPTEMBER 30,

2002 BALANCES) INCLUDED $125 MILLION OF UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES (NET OF

CEDING COMMISSIONS), $200 MILLION OF EXISTING LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES AND $24 MILLION OF OTHER REINSURANCE-RELATED LIABILITIES. THE TRANSFER

OF UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES TO PLATINUM WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS PROSPECTIVE

REINSURANCE, WHILE THE TRANSFER OF EXISTING LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVES WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE.

174

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE TRANSFER OF RESERVES TO PLATINUM

AT THE INCEPTION OF THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WAS BASED ON THE SEPTEMBER 30,

2002 BALANCES. IN MARCH 2003, WE TRANSFERRED TO PLATINUM $137 MILLION OF

ADDITIONAL INSURANCE RESERVES, CONSISTING OF $72 MILLION IN UNEARNED PREMIUMS

(NET OF CEDING COMMISSIONS) AND $65 MILLION IN EXISTING RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. WE ALSO TRANSFERRED CASH AND OTHER ASSETS HAVING A

VALUE EQUAL TO THE ADDITIONAL INSURANCE RESERVES TRANSFERRED. THIS TRANSFER OF

ADDITIONAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECTED BUSINESS ACTIVITY BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 30,

2002 AND THE NOVEMBER 2, 2002 INCEPTION DATE OF THE QUOTA SHARE

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, AND OUR ESTIMATE OF AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE ADJUSTMENT

PROVISIONS OF THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. OUR INSURANCE RESERVES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002 INCLUDED OUR ESTIMATE, AT THAT TIME, OF AMOUNTS DUE TO

PLATINUM UNDER THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, WHICH TOTALED $54

MILLION. THE $83 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR ESTIMATE OF AMOUNTS DUE TO PLATINUM UNDER

THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS RESULTED IN A PRETAX UNDERWRITING LOSS

OF $6 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003,

WE REACHED FINAL AGREEMENT WITH PLATINUM REGARDING THE ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS OF

THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS AND NO FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WILL OCCUR.

FOR BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE

UNITED KINGDOM, UNTIL OCTOBER 31, 2003, PLATINUM HAD THE RIGHT TO

UNDERWRITE SPECIFIED REINSURANCE BUSINESS ON OUR BEHALF IN CASES WHERE PLATINUM

WAS UNABLE TO UNDERWRITE THAT BUSINESS BECAUSE IT HAD YET TO OBTAIN NECESSARY

REGULATORY LICENSES OR APPROVAL TO DO SO, OR PLATINUM HAD NOT YET BEEN APPROVED

AS A REINSURER BY THE CEDING COMPANY. WE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT SOLELY AS

A MEANS TO ACCOMMODATE PLATINUM THROUGH A TRANSITION PERIOD. ANY BUSINESS

WRITTEN BY PLATINUM ON OUR POLICY FORMS DURING THIS TRANSITION PERIOD WAS FULLY

CEDED TO PLATINUM UNDER THE QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS.

UNDER THE

QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH PLATINUM, WE CEDED THE FOLLOWING

AMOUNTS TO PLATINUM IN 2003.

THE TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A PRETAX GAIN OF $29

MILLION AND AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $54 MILLION IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2002. THE AFTER-TAX LOSS WAS DRIVEN BY THE WRITE-OFF OF APPROXIMATELY $73

MILLION IN

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY INCURRED LOSSES RELATED TO ST. PAUL RES UNITED

KINGDOM-BASED OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION IN TAXES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRETAX GAIN.

OUR INVESTMENT IN PLATINUM

IS INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS.  THE

INCOME FROM OUR 14% PROPORTIONATE EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN PLATINUM IS INCLUDED IN

OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AS A COMPONENT OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE

DATE OF CLOSING. OUR WARRANTS TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL PLATINUM SHARES ARE

CARRIED AT THEIR MARKET VALUE ($65 MILLION AND $61 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY), WITH CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE RECORDED AS

OTHER REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES IN OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. IN 2003 AND

2002, WE RECORDED NET PRETAX REALIZED GAINS OF $4 MILLION AND $7 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THIS OPTION.

20   ASBESTOS

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

ON JUNE 3, 2002, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE AND CERTAIN

OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT SETTLING ALL EXISTING AND

FUTURE CLAIMS ARISING FROM ANY INSURING RELATIONSHIP OF UNITED STATES FIDELITY

AND GUARANTY COMPANY (USF&G), ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY

AND THEIR AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING US (COLLECTIVELY, THE USF&G

PARTIES) WITH ANY OF MACARTHUR COMPANY, WESTERN MACARTHUR COMPANY (WESTERN

MACARTHUR), AND WESTERN ASBESTOS COMPANY (WESTERN ASBESTOS) (TOGETHER, THE MACARTHUR

COMPANIES).

ON MARCH 26, 2002, A TRIAL COMMENCED IN THE

WESTERN MACARTHUR LITIGATION WHICH WAS PLANNED TO OCCUR IN THREE PHASES OVER

THE COURSE OF APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR, AND WHICH INVOLVED COMPLEX QUESTIONS OF FACT

AND LAW. AMONG THE ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE TRIAL WERE

THE STANDING OF WESTERN MACARTHUR TO RECOVER UNDER WESTERN ASBESTOS POLICIES

ISSUED BY USF&G (USF&G NEVER INSURED WESTERN MACARTHUR AND DISPUTED

WESTERN ASBESTOS PURPORTED ASSIGNMENT OF ITS INSURANCE RIGHTS TO WESTERN

MACARTHUR) AND THE EXISTENCE AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE POLICIES,

INCLUDING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE POLICIES CONTAINED PRODUCTS HAZARD COVERAGE

AND, IF SO, WHETHER THE POLICIES INCLUDED AGGREGATE LIMITS FOR PRODUCTS HAZARD

LIABILITY. USF&G BELIEVED IT HAD, AND CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAS,

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE PURPORTED ASSIGNMENTS OF INSURANCE RIGHTS BY

WESTERN ASBESTOS TO WESTERN MACARTHUR, WHICH WESTERN MACARTHUR ALLEGED OCCURRED

IN THE 1967-1970 TIME PERIOD AND IN 1997, AND WHICH WERE ALLEGEDLY RATIFIED IN

1999. USF&G ALSO BELIEVED THAT IT HAD A STRONG POSITION THAT THE POLICIES

DID NOT CONTAIN PRODUCTS HAZARD COVERAGE, BUT THAT EVEN IF THEY DID THE

COVERAGEWAS SUBJECT TO PRODUCTS

HAZARD AGGREGATES, WHICH LIMITED THE USF&G PARTIES EXPOSURE. AS THE TRIAL

BEGAN, THE COMPANY BELIEVED THAT IT COULD RESOLVE THE CASE BY LITIGATION OR

SETTLEMENT WITHIN THE EXISTING ASBESTOS RESERVES (GROSS ASBESTOS RESERVE

TOTALED $478 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001) ON THE BASIS OF THE

FOREGOING DEFENSES, A BELIEF SUPPORTED BY WESTERN MACARTHURS NOVEMBER 1999

SETTLEMENT OF A SIMILAR CLAIM BROUGHT AGAINST ANOTHER DEFENDANT INSURER FOR

$26 MILLION. GIVEN THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN BY MANAGEMENT AT THE

TIME WE FILED OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVED THAT OUR BEST

ESTIMATE OF AGGREGATE ASBESTOS RESERVES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 MADE A

REASONABLE PROVISION FOR WESTERN MACARTHUR AND ALL OTHER ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

THE FIRST PHASE OF THE TRIAL BEGAN ON MARCH 26,

2002. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TRIAL CAUSED US TO

REASSESS OUR EXPOSURE BASED ON THE INCREASED POSSIBILITY OF AN ADVERSE OUTCOME

IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE LITIGATION. AMONG THE SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

TRIAL BETWEEN APRIL 1 AND MAY 15, 2002 WERE EVIDENTIARY DECISIONS BY

THE TRIAL JUDGE TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE FAVORABLE TO USF&G REGARDING THE

ASSIGNMENT ISSUE AND TO ALLOW INTO EVIDENCE UNFAVORABLE EVIDENCE REGARDING

OTHER INSURERS POLICIES ON THE AGGREGATE LIMITS ISSUE, AND UNEXPECTED ADVERSE

TESTIMONY ON THE AGGREGATE LIMITS ISSUE. THESE DEVELOPMENTS LED US TO BELIEVE

THAT THERE WAS AN INCREASED RISK THAT THE JURY COULD FIND THAT USF&GS

POLICIES DID NOT CONTAIN AGGREGATE LIMITS FOR PRODUCTS HAZARD CLAIMS.

THESE DEVELOPMENTS AT TRIAL, COUPLED WITH GENERAL

CHANGES IN THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT AFFECTING THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY OF INSURERS

FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS, CAUSED US TO ENGAGE IN MORE INTENSE SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS

AT THE END OF APRIL, IN MAY, AND EARLY JUNE OF 2002.

176

AS OF MAY 15, 2002, THE DATE ON WHICH WE FILED

OUR FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2002, THE TRIAL AND

SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS WERE ONGOING, BUT THE PARTIES TO THE SETTLEMENT

DISCUSSIONS HAD BEEN UNABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON STRUCTURE, AMOUNT AND OTHER

SIGNIFICANT TERMS. AT THAT TIME, WE WERE PREPARED TO END SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS

BASED ON OUR CONTINUED BELIEF THAT WE COULD LITIGATE OUR POSITION AND POSSIBLY

REACH A MORE FAVORABLE OUTCOME THAN A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT WOULD PROVIDE. IN

SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, WE PERCEIVED THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES AS RANGING FROM MINIMAL

AMOUNTS WELL WITHIN OUR EXISTING ASBESTOS RESERVES TO UNKNOWN HIGHER AMOUNTS

(POTENTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT IN THE FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT,

DISCUSSED BELOW). ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVED THAT WE COULD NOT ESTIMATE A

REASONABLE RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSS FOR THE WESTERN MACARTHUR CLAIM, AND

THEREFORE COULD MAKE NO DISCLOSURE OF SUCH A RANGE. HOWEVER, AT THE TIME WE

FILED SUCH REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, WE BELIEVED, BASED ON VARIOUS ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE COURSE OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE TRIAL THROUGH MAY 15,

THAT ALTHOUGH THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE WESTERN MACARTHUR CASE WAS NOT

DETERMINABLE AT THAT TIME, IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT ITS RESOLUTION COULD BE

MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WE MADE DISCLOSURE OF THIS FACT IN

SUCH REPORT. WE DID NOT DISCLOSE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, AS WE WERE

UNABLE TO DO SO AT THE TIME OF THE FILING.

SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 15, 2002, THERE WERE ADDITIONAL

ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS AT THE TRIAL. USF&GS MOTIONS FOR NONSUIT AND FOR

RECONSIDERATION OF PRIOR EVIDENTIARY RULINGS WERE DENIED. IN LIGHT OF CONTINUED

ADVERSE TRIAL DEVELOPMENTS, THE FACT THAT JURY DELIBERATIONS ON THE FIRST PHASE

OF THE TRIAL WERE EXPECTED TO COMMENCE AS SOON AS THE SECOND WEEK OF JUNE, AND

IN AN EFFORT TO PUT ITS LARGEST KNOWN ASBESTOS EXPOSURE BEHIND US, WE BEGAN

NEGOTIATING A SINGLE LUMP-SUM PAYMENT SETTLEMENT WITH THE PLAINTIFFS. NEGOTIATIONS

WERE INTENSE AND ULTIMATELY THE COMPANY ACHIEVED A COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT ON JUNE 3,

2002, BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE JURY TRIAL. IMPORTANTLY,

THIS AGREEMENT (WHICH WAS SUBJECT TO BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL) NOT ONLY

SETTLED PENDING CLAIMS, IT ALSO SETTLED, WITH POSSIBLE MINOR EXCEPTIONS, ALL

CLAIMS THAT WESTERN MACARTHUR AND ITS AFFILIATES COULD POSSIBLY HAVE AGAINST US

AND USF&G, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE CLAIMS MADE IN THE PENDING

LAWSUIT, FOR A PRE-TAX LIABILITY THEN ESTIMATED AT $988 MILLION AS

DESCRIBED BELOW. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS FILED AS AN EXHIBIT TO OUR REPORT

ON FORM 8-K DATED JULY 23, 2002. THAT DOCUMENT INCLUDES MORE DETAILED

INFORMATION ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT, ON NOVEMBER 22, 2002, THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES FILED VOLUNTARY

PETITIONS UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE TO PERMIT THE CHANNELING OF

ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS SOLELY TO A TRUST TO BE

ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. CONSUMMATION

OF MOST ELEMENTS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS CONTINGENT UPON BANKRUPTCY

COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AS PART OF A BROADER PLAN FOR THE

REORGANIZATION OF THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES (THE PLAN). IN JANUARY 2004,

THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ISSUED AN

ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES, AND

CONFIRMING THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES PROPOSED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. WE ARE

AWAITING FINAL CONFIRMATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ORDER. FINAL APPROVAL OF

THE PLAN INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT INCLUDE THE RESOLUTION OF

VARIOUS APPEALS FROM THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS ORDER.

THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION INCLUDES AN INJUNCTION IN

FAVOR OF THE ST. PAUL AGAINST ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT LIABILITY FOR

ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES. UNDER THE INJUNCTION,

ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS OF THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES WILL

BE CHANNELED TO, AND PAID SOLELY FROM, THE TRUST ESTABLISHED BY THE PLAN. THE

MACARTHUR COMPANIES WILL RELEASE THE USF&G PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL ASBESTOS-RELATED

CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY, AND ALL OTHER CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF $1 MILLION IN THE

AGGREGATE, THAT MAY BE ASSERTED RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM, DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY, ANY ALLEGED COVERAGE PROVIDED BY ANY OF THE USF&G PARTIES TO

ANY OF THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR EXTRA CONTRACTUAL

RELIEF.

THE ST. PAUL HAS COMPLETED ITS FUNDING OBLIGATIONS

UNDER THE 2002 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, CONSISTING OF PAYMENTS OF $235 MILLION

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, AND $747 MILLION ON JANUARY 16, 2003

(INCLUDING INTEREST). FOLLOWING FINAL CONFIRMATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

RULING, THE ESCROWED FUNDS WILL

177

BE RELEASED TO THE TRUST

ESTABLISHED BY THE PLAN FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES ASBESTOS

RELATED CLAIMS. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDED FOR THE USF&G

PARTIES TO PAY $13 MILLION (WHICH WAS PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002) AND

TO ADVANCE CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE

SETTLEMENT, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS, FINALIZATION OF THE PLAN AND EFFORTS TO

ACHIEVE APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, SUBJECT TO A RIGHT OF REIMBURSEMENT IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES OF AMOUNTS ADVANCED.  UP TO

$175 MILLION OF THE INITIAL $235 MILLION PAYMENT WILL BE PAID TO COUNSEL FOR

THE MACARTHUR COMPANIES, AND PERSONS HOLDING JUDGMENTS AGAINST THE MACARTHUR

COMPANIES AS OF JUNE 3, 2002 AND THEIR COUNSEL, AND THE USF&G PARTIES

WILL BE RELEASED FROM CLAIMS BY SUCH HOLDERS TO THE EXTENT OF $110 MILLION PAID

TO SUCH HOLDERS. AT LEAST $60 MILLION FROM THE INITIAL PAYMENT AND THE $747

MILLION PAID IN 2003 WOULD BE RETURNED TO US IF FINAL CONFIRMATION OF THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT RULING DOES NOT OCCUR. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THOSE

PAYMENTS OF $807 MILLION WERE RECORDED IN BOTH OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER

LIABILITIES.

AMOUNT, PLUS INTEREST, TO THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE IN RESPECT OF THIS MATTER. AT DECEMBER 31,

MACARTHUR.

21   SEPTEMBER 11,

2001 TERRORIST ATTACK

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, OUR ESTIMATED GROSS

PRETAX LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE

TERRORIST ATTACK THAT OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TOTALED $2.3 BILLION,

WITH AN ESTIMATED NET PRETAX OPERATING LOSS OF $941 MILLION. THESE ESTIMATED

LOSSES WERE BASED ON A VARIETY OF ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES, COVERAGE INTERPRETATION

AND CLAIMS ESTIMATION METHODOLOGIES, AND INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE OF LOSSES

INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED, AS WELL AS ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT

OF CLAIMS. OUR ESTIMATE OF LOSSES WAS

ORIGINALLY BASED ON OUR BELIEF THAT PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE LOSSES FROM

THE TERRORIST ATTACK WILL TOTAL BETWEEN $30 BILLION AND $35 BILLION FOR THE

INSURANCE INDUSTRY. IN 2002, OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE LOSSES WAS SUPPLEMENTED

BY OUR ONGOING ANALYSIS OF BOTH PAID AND REPORTED CLAIMS RELATED TO THE ATTACK.

OUR ESTIMATE OF LOSSES REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES AND MAY

CHANGE OVER TIME AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR ESTIMATED

NET LOSSES RELATED TO THE TERRORIST ATTACK, WEIGHING ALL FACTORS THAT MAY

IMPACT THE TOTAL NET LOSSES WE WILL ULTIMATELY INCUR. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF

THOSE REGULAR EVALUATIONS, WE REALLOCATED CERTAIN ESTIMATED LOSSES AMONG OUR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY SEGMENTS IN 2003 AND 2002. IN ADDITION, IN 2003, WE RECORDED

A $46 MILLION REDUCTION IN ESTIMATED LOSSES RELATED TO THE ATTACK. IN 2002, WE

RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL LOSS PROVISION OF $20 MILLION AND A $33 MILLION

REDUCTION IN OUR ESTIMATED PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RELATED TO

THE ATTACK.

IN 2002, WE AND OTHER INSURERS OBTAINED A SUMMARY

JUDGMENT RULING THAT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER PROPERTY LOSS WAS A SINGLE

OCCURRENCE. CERTAIN INSUREDS, INCLUDING THE WORLD TRADE CENTERS LEASEHOLDER,

APPEALED THAT RULING, ASKING THE COURT TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROPERTY LOSS

CONSTITUTED TWO SEPARATE OCCURRENCES RATHER THAN ONE. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE U.S CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND

CIRCUIT RULED THAT UNDER TERMS OF THE POLICY FORM WE USED TO UNDERWRITE

PROPERTY COVERAGE FOR THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, THE TERRORIST ATTACK CONSTITUTED

ONE OCCURRENCE. ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH SEPARATE LITIGATION, THE AVIATION

LOSSES COULD BE DEEMED FOUR SEPARATE EVENTS RATHER THAN THREE, FOR PURPOSES OF

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE. EVEN IF THE COURTS ULTIMATELY RULE AGAINST

US REGARDING THE NUMBER OF EVENTS, WE BELIEVE THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF

ESTIMATED AFTER-TAX LOSSES, NET OF REINSURANCE, THAT WE WOULD RECORD WOULD NOT

BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

ORIGINAL ESTIMATED LOSSES IN 2001 AND THE ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN 2002 AND 2003

IMPACTED OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS FOLLOWS. THE TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT

WAS CALCULATED AT THE STATUTORY RATE OF 35%.

THE

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN NOVEMBER 2002.

THIS TEMPORARY LEGISLATION REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND

REQUIRES INSURERS TO OFFER COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF TERRORIST ACTS IN

THEIR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICIES, AND ESTABLISHES A

FEDERAL PROGRAM TO REIMBURSE INSURERS FOR A PORTION OF LOSSES SO INSURED.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

IN 2002, WE IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

AND REPORTING FOR ACQUIRED GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE STATEMENT

CHANGED PRIOR ACCOUNTING PRACTICE IN THE WAY INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE

USEFUL LIVES, INCLUDING GOODWILL, ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

GENERALLY, IT ALSO REQUIRED THAT THOSE ASSETS MEETING THE CRITERIA FOR

CLASSIFICATION AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH ESTIMABLE USEFUL LIVES BE AMORTIZED TO

EXPENSE OVER THOSE LIVES, WHILE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES

AND GOODWILL ARE NOT TO BE AMORTIZED. WE ALSO REVIEWED THE AMORTIZATION METHOD

AND USEFUL LIVES OF EXISTING INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE. GENERALLY,

AMORTIZATION WAS ACCELERATED AND USEFUL LIVES SHORTENED. AS A RESULT OF

IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 142, WE DID NOT RECORD ANY

GOODWILL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN 2003 OR 2002. FOR THE YEAR OF 2001, OUR GOODWILL

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE TOTALED $114 MILLION. AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH

INTANGIBLE ASSETS TOTALED $31 MILLION, $18 MILLION AND $2 MILLION FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, WE COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL

EVALUATION OF OUR RECORDED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 142, WHICH CONCLUDED THAT NONE OF OUR GOODWILL WAS

IMPAIRED.

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN

ASSETS PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS GOODWILL TO OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN 2002,

WE ESTABLISHED A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2002. THAT PROVISION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE

EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002.

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

OUR UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO FILE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH STATE AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED TO PREPARE THESE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOLLOW PRESCRIBED OR PERMITTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WHICH DIFFER FROM GAAP.

PRESCRIBED STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES INCLUDE STATE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND

GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE RULES ISSUED BY THE STATE OF DOMICILE AS WELL AS A

VARIETY OF PUBLICATIONS AND MANUALS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE

COMMISSIONERS (NAIC). PERMITTED STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES ENCOMPASS ALL

ACCOUNTING PRACTICES NOT SO PRESCRIBED, BUT ALLOWED BY THE STATE OF DOMICILE. BEGINNING

IN 2001, FIRE AND MARINE WAS GRANTED A PERMITTED PRACTICE REGARDING THE

VALUATION OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES,

ALLOWING IT TO VALUE THESE INVESTMENTS AT THEIR AUDITED GAAP EQUITY. SINCE

THESE INVESTMENTS WERE NOT REQUIRED TO BE VALUED ON A STATUTORY BASIS, FIRE AND

MARINE IS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT ON STATUTORY SURPLUS.

181

ON A STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS, OUR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS ESTIMATED NET INCOME FOR 2003 WAS

$795 MILLION. IN 2002, ACTUAL NET INCOME ON A STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS WAS

$550 MILLION, AND IN 2001, THOSE OPERATIONS ACTUAL NET LOSS ON A STATUTORY

ACCOUNTING BASIS WAS $1.13 BILLION. THE ESTIMATED STATUTORY SURPLUS

(SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) OF OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS WAS

$5.75 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE ACTUAL STATUTORY SURPLUS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002 WAS $5.22 BILLION.

THE NAIC PUBLISHED REVISED

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CODIFICATION PROJECT,

WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2001. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT TO OUR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OPERATIONS OF THE ADOPTION OF THESE PRACTICES WAS

TO INCREASE STATUTORY SURPLUS BY $126 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

TREATMENT OF DEFERRED TAXES.

26   IMPACT OF

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO BE ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE

IN DECEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 148,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE, WHICH

PROVIDES ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF TRANSITION FOR A VOLUNTARY CHANGE TO THE FAIR

VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. THIS

STATEMENT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN THE EVENT OF A VOLUNTARY CHANGE. IT

ALSO NO LONGER PERMITS THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL PROSPECTIVE METHOD OF TRANSITION

FOR CHANGES TO THE FAIR VALUE BASED METHOD FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2003. WE CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD,

AND HAVE NOT MADE A DETERMINATION REGARDING ANY CHANGE TO THE FAIR VALUE

METHOD.

184

AS

DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED A REVISED VERSION OF FASB INTERPRETATION

NO. 46, 

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES

 (FIN 46(R)), WHICH AGAIN DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE

DATE FOR CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R) UNTIL THE FIRST INTERIM OR ANNUAL

PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2003, WHICH FOR US WOULD BE THE PERIOD

ENDED MARCH 31, 2004. UNDER THE PARTIAL ADOPTION PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R),

WE EARLY-ADOPTED THE CONSOLIDATION AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF THIS

INTERPRETATION IN 2003. OUR PARTIAL ADOPTION SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED THE

FOLLOWING ITEM.

·

LLOYDS SYNDICATES

WE PARTICIPATE IN

VARIOUS LLOYDS SYNDICATES AT VARYING LEVELS. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE

IMPLICATIONS OF FIN 46(R) WITH RESPECT TO THESE SYNDICATES, AND AT THIS TIME WE

ARE NOT ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

ON JANUARY 12,

2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FASB STAFF

POSITION NO. FAS 106-1, 

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

 (FSP 106-1). THIS PRONOUNCEMENT

PROVIDES COMPANIES WITH THE OPTION TO MAKE A ONE-TIME ELECTION TO DEFER

ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICARE ACT REFERENCED IN ITS TITLE (THE

ACT). WE HAVE DECIDED TO DEFER ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACT UNDER FSP 106-1 AND HAVE

MADE THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURES IN NOTE 13RETIREMENT

PLANS TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FINAL ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED INFORMATION. WE WILL MONITOR THE

FASB DELIBERATIONS AND ACCOUNT FOR THE ACT BASED ON THE PRONOUNCEMENT EXPECTED

TO BE ISSUED.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

NONE.

ITEM 9A.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

THE ST. PAUL HAS

ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS THOSE TERMS

ARE DEFINED IN RULES 13A-14(C) AND 15D-14(C) UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE ACT). JAY S. FISHMAN, CHAIRMAN

AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE ST. PAUL, AND THOMAS A. BRADLEY, EXECUTIVE

VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE ST. PAUL, HAVE EVALUATED OUR

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2003. BASED ON THEIR EVALUATIONS, MESSRS. FISHMAN AND BRADLEY HAVE

CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE TO ENSURE

THAT THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY US IN REPORTS THAT WE FILE OR

SUBMIT UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED

WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED BY SEC RULES AND FORMS.

THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OR IN OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

AFFECT THESE CONTROLS AFTER THE DATE OF THEIR EVALUATIONS. THERE WERE NO

DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES, AND THEREFORE THERE WERE NO CORRECTIVE

ACTIONS TAKEN.

FOR ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, PRINCIPAL

ITEM 11.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

BOARD

OF DIRECTORS COMPENSATION

THE VALUE OF THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM AND THE

IMPORTANCE AND APPROPRIATENESS OF EACH OF ITS COMPONENTS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY

BY THE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE, WHICH CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE RESULTS

OF INDEPENDENT SURVEYS AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAMS OF PEER COMPANIES.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM ARE TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A PROGRAM DESIGNED

TO CLOSELY ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND TO ATTRACT

AND RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED DIRECTORS WITH TOTAL PAY OPPORTUNITY RANKING AT

190

LEAST IN THE SECOND

QUARTILE OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. THE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE REPORTS TO THE BOARD

OF DIRECTORS, WHICH CONSIDERS AND APPROVES THE PROGRAM.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ESTABLISHED A TARGET FOR

OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK FOR OUTSIDE DIRECTORS AT A VALUE OF

FIVE TIMES THE DIRECTORS ANNUAL RETAINER (CURRENTLY $22,500 PER YEAR). EACH

NEW DIRECTOR WILL BE ASKED TO MEET OR EXCEED THAT TARGET WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF

ELECTION TO THE BOARD. THE BOARD HAS ALSO ADOPTED A POLICY THAT THE COMPANY NOT

HIRE A DIRECTOR OR A DIRECTORS FIRM TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL OR FINANCIAL SERVICES,

EXCEPT WITH THE CONSENT OF THE BOARD GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE.

UNDER THE COMPANYS CURRENT DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

PROGRAM, OUTSIDE DIRECTORS ARE ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION COMPRISED OF A $22,500

ANNUAL RETAINER, A $1,000 MEETING FEE IN RESPECT OF EACH BOARD AND COMMITTEE

MEETING ATTENDED, AN ANNUAL STOCK OPTION AWARD OF 6,000 SHARES OF COMPANY

COMMON STOCK, AND PARTICIPATION IN THE DIRECTORS CHARITABLE AWARD PROGRAM AND

THE DEFERRED STOCK PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS (THE DEFERRED STOCK PLAN).

ALSO, OUTSIDE DIRECTORS WHO CHAIR A COMMITTEE RECEIVE AN ANNUAL FEE OF $4,000.

THE COMPONENTS OF THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING

PARAGRAPHS.

ANNUAL

RETAINER, MEETING FEES AND COMMITTEE CHAIR FEES.

DIRECTORS MAY ELECT TO HAVE ALL OR

ANY PORTION OF THEIR ANNUAL RETAINER, THEIR MEETING FEES, AND ANY COMMITTEE

CHAIR FEES PAID IN CASH OR DEFERRED THROUGH THE DIRECTORS DEFERRED

COMPENSATION PLAN AND INVESTED IN A PHANTOM COMPANY COMMON STOCK FUND AND/OR

NINE PHANTOM INVESTMENT FUNDS. ALTHOUGH NO SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK

ARE PURCHASED FOR OR HELD IN THE PHANTOM COMPANY STOCK FUND, ANY DIRECTOR WHO

ELECTS TO HAVE ANY OF HIS OR HER FEES DIRECTED INTO THAT FUND WILL BE DEEMED TO

HAVE PURCHASED SHARES ON THE DATE THE FEES WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN PAID IN

CASH. THE VALUE OF THAT FUND RISES OR FALLS AS THE PRICE OF COMPANY COMMON

STOCK FLUCTUATES IN THE MARKET. ALSO, DIVIDENDS ON THOSE PHANTOM SHARES ARE REINVESTED

IN ADDITIONAL PHANTOM SHARES. CASH DISTRIBUTIONS ARE MADE FROM THE PHANTOM

COMPANY STOCK FUND AND FROM THE OTHER INVESTMENT FUNDS ON PRE-DESIGNATED DATES,

USUALLY FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR, AT THE CLOSING PRICE OF

THE COMMON STOCK AND THE INVESTMENT FUNDS ON THE DATE OF DISTRIBUTION. CURRENTLY,

TEN OUTSIDE DIRECTORS HAVE DEFERRED AT LEAST A PORTION OF THEIR FEES INTO THE

DIRECTORS DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN, AND SEVEN OF THOSE DIRECTORS HAVE ALL OR

A PORTION OF THEIR PLAN INTEREST INVESTED IN THE PHANTOM COMPANY COMMON STOCK

FUND.

STOCK

OPTIONS.

UNDER

THE COMPANYS AMENDED AND RESTATED 1994 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (STOCK INCENTIVE

PLAN), ANNUAL NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION GRANTS COVERING 6,000 COMMON SHARES

ARE MADE TO EACH OUTSIDE DIRECTOR AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE BOARD FOLLOWING

THE END OF THE COMPANYS THIRD QUARTER. SUCH OPTIONS ARE GRANTED AT THE MARKET

PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND BECOME EXERCISABLE

IN 25% INCREMENTS ON THE FIRST FOUR ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT. UNDER

THAT PLAN, OPTIONS TERMINATE AT THE EARLIEST OF 10 YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF

GRANT, IMMEDIATELY IF DIRECTORSHIP IS TERMINATED FOR CAUSE, 90 DAYS AFTER

ANY VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR OTHER THAN BY RETIREMENT

(BUT THE OPTION IN THIS CASE MAY BE EXERCISED ONLY TO THE EXTENT IT WAS

EXERCISABLE ON THE DATE OF SUCH TERMINATION), OR ANY EARLIER TIME SET BY THE COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE AT THE TIME OF OPTION GRANT. A DIRECTORS RETIREMENT WILL NOT

ACCELERATE THE TERMINATION OF OPTIONS GRANTED AFTER 1998. OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER

THE STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN PRIOR TO 1999 WILL TERMINATE THREE YEARS AFTER

RETIREMENT OR EARLIER UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLY IN

THE CASE OF DEATH OF AN OPTIONEE OR IN THE CASE OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL, AS

DEFINED BELOW. IF AN OPTION WAS NOT FULLY EXERCISABLE AT THE TIME OF OCCURRENCE

OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL, ALL PORTIONS OF THE OPTION IMMEDIATELY WOULD BECOME

EXERCISABLE IN FULL.

CHANGE OF CONTROL IS DEFINED IN THE STOCK INCENTIVE

PLAN TO MEAN A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF THE COMPANY OF A NATURE THAT WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON FORM 8-K

PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE ACT), WITH SUCH

CHANGE OF CONTROL TO BE DEEMED TO HAVE OCCURRED WHEN (A) ANY PERSON, AS

DEFINED IN THE EXCHANGE ACT, OTHER THAN THE COMPANY OR A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY OR

ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS, IS OR BECOMES THE BENEFICIAL

191

OWNER OF 50 PERCENT

OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OR (B) MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS ON MAY 3, 1994 (THE INCUMBENT BOARD) CEASE TO CONSTITUTE A

MAJORITY THEREOF (PROVIDED THAT PERSONS SUBSEQUENTLY BECOMING DIRECTORS WITH

THE APPROVAL OF DIRECTORS COMPRISING AT LEAST THREE-QUARTERS OF THE

INCUMBENT BOARD SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS MEMBERS OF THE INCUMBENT BOARD). ALL

CURRENT DIRECTORS ARE CONSIDERED MEMBERS OF THE INCUMBENT BOARD. THE

CONSUMMATION OF THE PROPOSED MERGER WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL FOR

THESE PURPOSES, AND DIRECTOR OPTIONS WILL IMMEDIATELY VEST AT THAT TIME.

DIRECTOR

TENURE PROGRAM.

A

BOARD POLICY PROVIDES THAT EACH DIRECTOR WITH 15 OR MORE YEARS OF SERVICE AND

EACH DIRECTOR WHO WILL BE AT LEAST 70 YEARS OLD ON OR BEFORE THE DATE OF

THE NEXT SHAREHOLDERS MEETING SHALL TENDER HIS OR HER RESIGNATION TO THE CHAIR

OF THE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE BY NOVEMBER 20 OF EACH YEAR INDICATING HIS OR

HER INTENT NOT TO STAND FOR RE-ELECTION AT THE SUBSEQUENT ANNUAL MEETING OF THE

SHAREHOLDERS. ADDITIONALLY, UPON A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN PRINCIPAL EMPLOYMENT,

A DIRECTOR SHOULD TENDER HIS OR HER RESIGNATION. IF, HOWEVER, UPON REVIEW, THE

GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE DETERMINES THAT THERE IS A CONTINUING NEED ON THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS FOR THE TYPE OF QUALIFICATIONS THE RESIGNING DIRECTOR PROVIDES, THEN

SUCH DIRECTOR MAY BE ASKED TO BECOME A CANDIDATE FOR RE-ELECTION.

DEFERRED

STOCK PLAN.

THE

DEFERRED STOCK PLAN IS INTENDED TO FURTHER ALIGN THE NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. UNDER THE DEFERRED

STOCK PLAN, PARTICIPATING NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS RECEIVE, IN AN ACCOUNT IN THE

DIRECTORS NAME, AN ANNUAL CREDIT OF $25,000 WHICH IS DEEMED INVESTED, ON THE

BUSINESS DAY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS, IN THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BASED ON THE CLOSING PRICE OF COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE

CREDITED. DIVIDENDS ON THE ACCUMULATED SHARES ARE DEEMED REINVESTED IN

ADDITIONAL SHARES. THE DEFERRED STOCK PLAN PROVIDES THAT UPON A DIRECTORS

CESSATION OF SERVICE FOR ANY REASON, THE ACCUMULATED SHARES IN THAT DIRECTORS

ACCOUNT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED IN THE FORM OF SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON

STOCK, ALL AT ONCE OR IN INSTALLMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE PARTICIPATING

DIRECTORS ELECTION.

DIRECTORS

CHARITABLE AWARD PROGRAM.

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS POLICY OF PROVIDING SUPPORT

FOR CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS AND IN ORDER TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED

DIRECTORS, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ESTABLISHED THE DIRECTORS CHARITABLE AWARD

PROGRAM, WHICH IS FUNDED BY LIFE INSURANCE ON THE LIVES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO MAKE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF

$1 MILLION PER DIRECTOR, PAID OUT OVER A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS FOLLOWING

THE DEATH OF THE DIRECTOR. EACH DIRECTOR IS ABLE TO RECOMMEND UP TO FOUR

CHARITIES TO RECEIVE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE COMPANY. DIRECTORS BECOME VESTED IN

THIS PROGRAM IN $200,000 ANNUAL INCREMENTS STARTING WITH THEIR FIRST

ANNIVERSARY OF ELECTION AS A DIRECTOR. DIRECTORS ARE FULLY VESTED UPON THE

EARLIEST OF THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR ELECTION AS A DIRECTOR, DEATH,

DISABILITY, OR RETIREMENT AT OR AFTER AGE 70 OR UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL

(GENERALLY DEFINED IN THE SAME MANNER AS IN THE STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN DESCRIBED

ABOVE). THE CONSUMMATION OF THE PROPOSED MERGER WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE OF

CONTROL FOR THESE PURPOSES. BENEFICIARY ORGANIZATIONS DESIGNATED UNDER THIS

PROGRAM MUST BE TAX-EXEMPT, AND DONATIONS ULTIMATELY PAID BY THE COMPANY SHOULD

BE DEDUCTIBLE AGAINST FEDERAL AND OTHER INCOME TAXES PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE TAX LAWS APPLICABLE AT THE TIME. DIRECTORS DERIVE NO

FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM, SINCE ALL INSURANCE PROCEEDS AND CHARITABLE

DEDUCTIONS ACCRUE SOLELY TO THE COMPANY.

GRANTOR

TRUST.

THE

COMPANY HAS TRANSFERRED FUNDS TO A GRANTOR TRUST CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF

IMPLEMENTING BENEFITS UNDER VARIOUS NON-QUALIFIED PLANS OF DEFERRED

COMPENSATION, INCLUDING THE DIRECTORS DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN AND THE

DIRECTORS RETIREMENT PLAN (THE IMPLEMENTED PLANS). FOLLOWING A CHANGE OF

CONTROL NO PORTION OF THE TRUST ASSETS MAY BE RETURNED TO THE COMPANY OR ANY

SUBSIDIARY UNLESS THE TRUSTEE DETERMINES THAT SUCH PORTION OF THE ASSETS AND

FUTURE EARNINGS ON IT NEVER WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY BENEFITS AND IF A MAJORITY

OF THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE IMPLEMENTED PLANS CONSENT TO THE RETURN OF THE

ASSETS. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE PROPOSED MERGER WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE A CHANGE

OF CONTROL FOR THESE PURPOSES. UNLIKE ASSETS HELD IN THE TRUSTS CREATED TO

IMPLEMENT BENEFITS UNDER THE COMPANYS TAX-QUALIFIED PLANS, ASSETS HELD IN THE

GRANTOR TRUST REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE CLAIMS OF THE COMPANYS CREDITORS.

192

IF THE COMPANY

BECOMES INSOLVENT, THE TRUSTEE WILL BE REQUIRED TO CEASE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

UNDER ALL IMPLEMENTED PLANS AND DISPOSE OF TRUST ASSETS PURSUANT TO THE

DIRECTION OF A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.

PENSION

ALL OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVES PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPANYS

PENSION PLANS. THE AMOUNT OF THEIR REMUNERATION WHICH IS COVERED BY A QUALIFIED

PLAN FOR 2003 IS THE AMOUNT SET FORTH IN THE SALARY, BONUS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

AWARD (GRANTED PURSUANT TO THE CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PLAN) COLUMNS OF THE

SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE UP TO THE QUALIFIED PLAN COMPENSATION LIMIT. ANY

REMUNERATION EXCEEDING THAT LIMIT IS COVERED UNDER THE COMPANYS NONQUALIFIED

PENSION PLAN.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2001, THE PENSION PLAN WAS

AMENDED TO PROVIDE A CASH BALANCE BENEFIT FORMULA. THIS FORMULA APPLIES TO ALL

EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2001. EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1,

2001, WERE GIVEN A CHOICE IN THE YEAR 2000 OF REMAINING UNDER THE PRIOR DEFINED

BENEFIT FORMULA (THE TRADITIONAL FORMULA) OR CONVERTING TO THE CASH BALANCE

FORMULA. BOTH MESSRS. FISHMAN AND HEYMAN WERE HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1,

2001, AND WILL HAVE THEIR BENEFITS DETERMINED UNDER THE CASH BALANCE FORMULA.

MESSRS. MILLER AND BRADLEY AND MS. ZURAITIS ELECTED TO HAVE THEIR

BENEFIT CALCULATED UNDER THE CASH BALANCE FORMULA. AS A RESULT, NONE OF THE

NAMED EXECUTIVES HAVE THEIR BENEFITS DETERMINED UNDER THE TRADITIONAL FORMULA. RETIREMENT

BENEFITS FOR MESSRS. MILLER AND BRADLEY AND MS. ZURAITIS ARE FULLY

VESTED.

THE CASH BALANCE BENEFIT IS EXPRESSED IN THE FORM OF A

HYPOTHETICAL ACCOUNT BALANCE. FOR PERIODS BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2001 AND DECEMBER 31,

2002, BENEFIT CREDITS ACCRUED ANNUALLY AT A RATE BETWEEN 6% AND 10%. FOR

PERIODS AFTER JANUARY 1, 2003, BENEFIT CREDITS WILL ACCRUE ANNUALLY AT A

RATE BETWEEN 3% AND 5%. A PARTICIPANTS INDIVIDUAL RATE WILL INCREASE WITH AGE

AND SERVICE. INTEREST CREDITS ARE APPLIED QUARTERLY TO THE PRIOR QUARTERS

BALANCE; THESE INTEREST CREDITS ARE BASED ON THE YIELD ON 10-YEAR TREASURY

BONDS. ALTHOUGH THE NORMAL FORM OF BENEFIT IS AN ANNUITY, THE HYPOTHETICAL

ACCOUNT BALANCE IS ALSO PAYABLE AS A SINGLE LUMP SUM.

THE

ESTIMATED ANNUAL BENEFIT PROVIDED IN TOTAL BY THE CASH BALANCE FORMULA

AMENDED AND

RESTATED SPECIAL (CHANGE OF CONTROL) SEVERANCE POLICY

UNDER THE COMPANYS AMENDED AND RESTATED SPECIAL

SEVERANCE POLICY (POLICY), SEVERANCE BENEFITS WOULD BE PROVIDED TO ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ALL OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVES, IN THE EVENT

THEIR EMPLOYMENT TERMINATES UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS WITHIN TWO YEARS FOLLOWING

A CHANGE OF CONTROL (AS DEFINED IN THE POLICY). IF THE EMPLOYMENT OF ANY NAMED

EXECUTIVE IS TERMINATED WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER A CHANGE OF CONTROL BY THE

EMPLOYER OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, OR BY THE EMPLOYEE FOR GOOD REASON, OR IF THE

EMPLOYMENT OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE TERMINATES FOR ANY REASON DURING THE 30-DAY

PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, THE NAMED

EXECUTIVE WOULD BECOME ENTITLED TO CERTAIN BENEFITS. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE

PROPOSED MERGER WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE OF CONTROL UNDER THIS POLICY.

UNDER THE POLICY, FOR NAMED

EXECUTIVES, THE TERM CAUSE IS GENERALLY DEFINED AS WILLFULLY ENGAGING IN

ILLEGAL CONDUCT

OR GROSS MISCONDUCT WHICH IS DEMONSTRABLY AND MATERIALLY

INJURIOUS TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES OR WILLFUL AND CONTINUED FAILURE TO

PERFORM SUBSTANTIALLY HIS OR HER DUTIES AFTER A WRITTEN DEMAND IS DELIVERED BY

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

GOOD

REASON IS DEFINED TO INCLUDE SUCH SITUATIONS AS A CHANGE IN DUTIES OR

RESPONSIBILITIES THAT IS INCONSISTENT IN ANY MATERIALLY ADVERSE RESPECT WITH

THE NAMED EXECUTIVES POSITIONS, DUTIES, RESPONSIBILITIES OR STATUS PRIOR TO

THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, A MATERIALLY ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE NAMED EXECUTIVES

TITLES AND OFFICES (INCLUDING, IF APPLICABLE, MEMBERSHIP ON THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS) AS IN EFFECT IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, A REDUCTION

IN THE NAMED EXECUTIVES RATE OF BASE SALARY OR ANNUAL TARGET BONUS

OPPORTUNITY, JOB RELOCATIONS OF A CERTAIN TYPE AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN BENEFITS

THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS ARE IN EFFECT WHEN THE CHANGE OF CONTROL

OCCURS.

THE FOLLOWING IS A

SUMMARY OF THE SEVERANCE BENEFITS PROVIDED TO NAMED EXECUTIVES UNDER THE

POLICY.

1.     A NAMED

EXECUTIVE WILL RECEIVE A LUMP-SUM SEVERANCE PAYMENT EQUAL TO THREE TIMES THE

SUM OF (I) THE HIGHEST ANNUAL BASE SALARY RATE PAYABLE TO THE NAMED

EXECUTIVE DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO TERMINATION AND (II) THE

NAMED EXECUTIVES TARGET BONUS FOR THE YEAR OF TERMINATION.

196

2.     PARTICIPATION

WILL BE CONTINUED FOR THREE YEARS IN THOSE MEDICAL, DENTAL, DISABILITY AND LIFE

INSURANCE PROGRAMS IN WHICH THE NAMED EXECUTIVE PARTICIPATED ON THE DATE

EMPLOYMENT TERMINATED.

3.     OUTPLACEMENT

ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED WHICH IS NO LESS FAVORABLE THAN UNDER THE TERMS OF

THE OUTPLACEMENT ASSISTANCE PLAN APPLICABLE TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE AT THE TIME

OF THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, UNLESS THE NAMED EXECUTIVE ELECTS TO RECEIVE A LUMP

CASH PAYMENT IN LIEU THEREOF.

4.     IF THE

PAYMENTS TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE EXCISE TAX ON EXCESS

PARACHUTE PAYMENTS IMPOSED BY SECTION 4999 OF THE CODE, THE COMPANY WILL

REIMBURSE THE NAMED EXECUTIVE FOR THE AMOUNT OF SUCH EXCISE TAX (AND THE INCOME

AND EXCISE TAXES ON SUCH REIMBURSEMENT), SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS.

THE POLICY IS SUBJECT TO

AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO A CHANGE OF CONTROL UNLESS THE

AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION IS APPROVED WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF THE CHANGE OF

CONTROL AND WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RIGHTS (OR POTENTIAL RIGHTS) OF THE

NAMED EXECUTIVE. AFTER A CHANGE OF CONTROL, NO AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF THE

POLICY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RIGHTS (OR POTENTIAL RIGHTS) OF THE NAMED

EXECUTIVE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH A CHANGE OF CONTROL.
