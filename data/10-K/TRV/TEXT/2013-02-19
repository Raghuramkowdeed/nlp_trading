item1.business
the travelers companies,inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the company) is a holding company principally
engaged, through its subsidiaries, in providing a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations and
individuals. the company is incorporated as a general business corporation under the laws of the state of minnesota and is one of the oldest insurance organizations in the united states, dating back
to 1853. the principal executive offices of the company are located at 485lexington avenue, new york, new york10017, and its telephone number is (917)778-6000. the
company also maintains executive offices in hartford, connecticut,
and st.paul, minnesota. the term "trv" in this document refers to the travelers companies,inc., the parent holding company excluding subsidiaries.
for
a summary of the company's revenues, operating income and total assets by reportable business segments, see note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
property and casualty insurance operations
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive in the areas of price, service, product offerings, agent
relationships and methods of distribution. distribution methods include the use of independent agents, exclusive agents, direct marketing (including use of toll-free numbers and the internet) and/or
salaried employees. according toa.m. best, there are approximately 1,326 property and casualty groups in the united states, comprising approximately 2,778 property and casualty companies. of
those groups, the top 150 accounted for approximately 92% of the consolidated industry's total net written premiums in 2011. the company competes with both foreign and domestic insurers. in addition,
several property and casualty insurers writing commercial lines of business, including the company, offer products for alternative forms of risk protection in addition to traditional insurance
products. these products include large deductible programs and various forms of self-insurance, some of which utilize captive insurance companies and risk retention groups. the company's competitive
position in the marketplace is based on many factors, including the following:
premiums charged;
contract terms and conditions;
products and services offered;
claim service;
agent, broker and client relationships;
local presence;
geographic scope of business;
overall financial strength;
ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;
experience and qualifications of employees; and
technology and information systems.
in
addition, the marketplace is affected by available capacity of the insurance industry, as measured by policyholders' surplus, and the availability of reinsurance. industry capacity as
measured by policyholders' surplus expands and contracts primarily in conjunction with profit levels generated by the industry, less amounts returned to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases. capital raised by debt and equity offerings may also increase policyholders' surplus.
table of contents
pricing and underwriting
pricing of the company's property and casualty insurance products is generally developed based upon an estimation of expected losses,
the expenses associated with producing, issuing and servicing business and managing claims, the time value of money related to the expected loss and expense cash flows, and a reasonable allowance for
profit that considers the capital needed to support the company's business. the company has a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that over the long-term emphasizes
product returns and profitable growth rather than premium volume or market share. the company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations regarding rate and policy form
approvals. the applicable state laws and regulations establish standards in certain lines of business to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or used to engage in
unfair price competition. the company's ability to increase rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each respective state's requirements, as well as the competitive market
environment.

catastrophe exposure
the wide geographic distribution of the company's property and casualty insurance operations exposes it to claims arising out of
catastrophes. the company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to continually monitor and analyze underwriting risks of business in
natural catastrophe-prone areas and target risk areas for conventional terrorist attacks (defined as attacks other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events). the company relies, in
part, upon this analysis to make underwriting decisions designed to manage its exposure on catastrophe-exposed business. for example, the company has limited the writing of new property and homeowners
business in some markets and has selectively taken underwriting actions on new and existing business. these underwriting actions on new and existing business include tightened underwriting standards,
selective price increases and changes to deductibles specific to hurricane-, tornado-, wind- and hail-prone areas. see "item7management's discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operationscatastrophe modeling" and "changing climate conditions."
table of contents
the
company also utilizes reinsurance to manage its aggregate exposures to catastrophes. see "reinsurance."
the
company is organized into three reportable business segments: business insurance; financial, professional& international insurance; and personal insurance.
business insurance
the business insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services to its clients
primarily in the united states. business insurance is organized into the following six groups, which collectively comprise business insurance core
operations:
select accounts provides small businesses with property and casualty
products, including commercial multi-peril, commercial property, general liability, commercial auto and workers' compensation insurance.
commercial accounts provides mid-sized businesses with
property and casualty products, including commercial multi-peril, commercial property, general liability, commercial auto and workers' compensation insurance.
national accounts provides large companies with casualty products and
services, including workers' compensation, general liability and automobile liability, generally utilizing loss-sensitive products, on both a bundled and unbundled basis. national accounts also
includes the company's commercial residual market business, which primarily offers workers' compensation products and services to the involuntary market.
industry-focused underwriting.the following units provide
targeted industries with differentiated combinations of insurance coverage, risk management, claims handling and other services:
construction serves a broad range of construction businesses, offering
guaranteed cost products for small to mid-sized policyholders and loss-sensitive programs for larger accounts. for the larger accounts, the customer and the company work together in actively managing
and controlling exposure and claims, and they share risk through policy features such as deductibles or retrospective rating. products offered include workers' compensation, general liability,
umbrella and commercial auto coverages, and other risk management solutions.
technology serves small to large companies involved in telecommunications,
information technology, medical technology and electronics manufacturing, offering a comprehensive portfolio of products and services. products offered include commercial property, commercial auto,
general liability, workers' compensation, umbrella, internet liability, technology errors and omissions coverages and global companion products.
public sector services provides insurance products and services to public
entities including municipalities, counties, indian nation gaming organizations and selected special government districts such as water and sewer utilities. the policies written by this unit typically
cover commercial property, commercial auto, general liability, professional liability and workers' compensation exposures.
oil& gas provides specialized property and liability products and
services for customers involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, including operators and drilling contractors, as well as various service and supply companies and
manufacturers that support upstream operations. the policies written by this business group cover risks including physical damage, liability, business interruption and workers' compensation.
table of contents
agribusiness serves small to medium-sized agricultural businesses,
including farms, ranches, wineries and related operations, offering property and liability coverages other than workers' compensation.
target risk underwriting.the following units serve
commercial businesses requiring specialized product underwriting, claims handling and risk management services:
national property provides traditional and customized property insurance
programs to large and mid-sized customers, including office building owners, manufacturers, municipalities and schools, retailers and service businesses. these insurance programs cover losses on
buildings, business personal property and business interruption exposures.
inland marine provides insurance for goods in transit and movable objects
for customers such as jewelers, museums, contractors and the transportation industry. builders' risk insurance is also offered to customers during the construction, renovation or repair of buildings
and other structures.
ocean marine serves the marine transportation industry and related
services, as well as other businesses involved in international trade. the company's product offerings in this unit fall under six main coverage categories: marine liability, cargo, hull and
machinery, protection and indemnity, pleasure craft, and marine property and liability.
excess casualty serves small to mid-sized commercial
businesses, offering mono-line umbrella and excess coverage where the company typically does not write the primary casualty coverage, or where other business units within the company prefer to access
the underwriting expertise and/or limit capacity of the excess casualty business unit.
boiler& machinery serves small to large companies, offering
comprehensive breakdown coverages for equipment, including property and business interruption coverages. through the boilerre unit, boiler& machinery also serves other property and casualty
carriers that do not have in-house expertise with reinsurance, underwriting, engineering, claim handling and risk management services for this type of coverage.
global partner services provides insurance to foreign organizations with
property and liability exposures located in the united states (reverse-flow) as part of a global program.
specialized distribution.the following units market and
underwrite their products to customers predominantly through licensed wholesale, general and program agents that manage customers' unique insurance requirements:
northland provides insurance coverage for the commercial transportation
industry, as well as commercial liability and package policies for small, difficult to place specialty classes of commercial business on an admitted or excess and surplus lines basis.
national programs offers tailored property and casualty programs on an
admitted basis for customers with common risk characteristics or coverage requirements. programs available include those for entertainment, architects and engineers, equipment rental, golf services
and owners of franchised businesses.
business
insurance also includes the special liability group (which manages the company's asbestos and environmental liabilities) and the assumed reinsurance and certain other runoff
operations, which are collectively referred to as business insurance other.

principal markets and methods of distribution
business insurance distributes its products through approximately 10,500 independent agencies and brokers located throughout the united
states that are serviced by 118 field offices and three customer service centers. business insurance continues to make significant investments in enhanced technology utilizing internet-based
applications to provide real-time interface capabilities with independent agencies and brokers. business insurance builds relationships with well-established, independent
insurance agencies and brokers. in selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products, business insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency's or broker's financial
strength, staff experience and strategic fit with the company's operating and marketing plans. once an agency or broker is appointed, business insurance carefully monitors its performance. the
majority of products offered by the select accounts, commercial accounts, industry-focused underwriting and target-risk underwriting groups are distributed through a common base of
independent agents and brokers, many of whom also sell the company's personal insurance products. additionally, the industry-focused underwriting and target risk underwriting groups may underwrite
business with agents that specialize in servicing the needs of certain of the industries served by these groups.
select accounts is a leading provider of commercial property and casualty insurance products to small businesses, generally with fewer
than 50 employees. products offered by select accounts are guaranteed-cost policies, including packaged products covering property and liability exposures. each small business risk is
independently evaluated via an automated underwriting platform which in turn enables agents to quote, bind and issue a substantial amount of new small business risks at their desktop. risks with more
complex characteristics are underwritten with the assistance of company personnel. the automated underwriting platform has significantly streamlined the agent desktop underwriting process.
table of contents
commercial accounts sells a broad range of commercial property and casualty insurance products through a large network of independent
agents and brokers, primarily targeting mid-sized businesses with 50 to 1,000 employees. the company offers a full line of products to its commercial accounts customers with an emphasis on
guaranteed cost programs. each account is underwritten based on the unique risk characteristics, loss history and coverage needs of the account. the ability to underwrite at this detailed level allows
commercial accounts to have a broad risk appetite and a diversified customer base.
national accounts sells a variety of casualty products and services to large companies through a network of national and regional brokers,
primarily utilizing loss-sensitive products in connection with a large deductible or self-insured program and, to a lesser extent, a retrospectively rated or a guaranteed cost
insurance policy. national accounts also provides casualty products and services through retail brokers on an unbundled basis, using third-party administrators for insureds who utilize programs such
as collateralized deductibles, captive reinsurers and self-insurance. national accounts provides insurance-related services, such as risk management services, claims administration, loss
control and risk management information services, either in addition to, or in lieu of, pure risk coverage, and generated $193million of fee income in 2012, excluding commercial residual
market business. the commercial residual market business of national accounts sells claims and policy management services to workers' compensation pools throughout the united states, and generated
$82million in fee income in 2012.
workers'
compensation accounted for approximately 73% of sales to national accounts customers during 2012, based on direct written premiums and fees.
industry-focused underwriting markets commercial property and casualty insurance products and services through a large network of agents
and brokers. these products and services are tailored to targeted industry segments of significant size and complexity that require unique underwriting, claim, risk management or other
insurance-related products and services.
target risk underwriting markets commercial property and casualty insurance products and services through a large network of agents and
brokers to a wide customer base having specialized property and casualty coverage requirements.
specialized distribution distributes admitted and excess and surplus lines property and casualty products predominantly through selected
wholesale agents, both on a brokerage and managing general underwriting basis, and through selected program agents. these brokers, general agents and program agents operate in certain markets that are
not typically served by the company's appointed retail agents, or they maintain certain affinity arrangements in specialized market segments. the wholesale excess and surplus lines market, which is
characterized by the absence of rate and form regulation, allows for more flexibility to write certain classes of business. in working with wholesale or program agents on a brokerage basis,
specialized distribution underwrites the business and sets the premium level. in working with wholesale or program agents on a managing general underwriting or program manager basis, the agents
produce and underwrite business subject to underwriting guidelines that have been specifically designed for each facility or program.
pricing and underwriting
business insurance has developed an underwriting and pricing methodology that incorporates underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial
and product development disciplines for particular industries, and enables business insurance to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters. this approach is designed to
maintain high-quality underwriting and pricing discipline utilizing proprietary data gathered and analyzed with respect to business over many years. the underwriters and engineers use this
information, which provides specialized knowledge about specific industry segments, to assess and evaluate risks. the company utilizes both standard industry forms and proprietary forms for the
insurance policies it issues.
table of contents
for
smaller businesses meeting pre-determined exposure characteristics and thresholds, select accounts utilizes an automated underwriting system that enables agents to issue
a significant number of new policies at their desktop.
a
portion of business in this segment, particularly in national accounts and construction, is written with large deductible insurance policies. under workers' compensation insurance
contracts with deductible features, the company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. the company is subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount
and is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. at december31, 2012, contractholder payables on unpaid losses within the deductible layer of large deductible policies and the
associated receivables were each approximately $4.78billion. retrospectively rated policies are primarily used for workers' compensation coverage. although the retrospectively rated feature of
the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the company, it introduces additional credit risk to the company. premium receivables from holders of retrospectively rated policies totaled
approximately $116million at december31, 2012. significant collateral, primarily letters of credit and, to a lesser extent, cash collateral or trusts, is generally requested for large
deductible plans and/or retrospectively rated policies that provide for deferred collection of deductible recoveries and/or ultimate premiums. the amount of collateral requested is predicated upon the
creditworthiness of the customer and the nature of the insured risks. business insurance continually monitors the credit exposure on individual accounts and the adequacy of collateral.
product lines
the business insurance segment writes the following types of coverages:
workers'
compensation.provides coverage for employers for specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to
employees. there are typically four types of benefits payable under workers' compensation policies: medical benefits, disability benefits, death benefits and vocational rehabilitation benefits. the
company emphasizes managed care cost containment strategies, which involve employers, employees and care providers in a cooperative effort that focuses on the injured employee's early return to work
and cost-effective quality care. the company offers the following types of workers' compensation products:
guaranteed-cost insurance products, in which policy premium charges are fixed for the period of coverage and
do not vary as a result of the insured's loss experience;
loss-sensitive insurance products, including large deductible and retrospectively rated policies, in which
fees or premiums are adjusted based on actual loss experience of the insured during the policy period; and
service programs, which are generally sold to the company's national accounts customers, where the company receives fees
rather than premiums for providing loss prevention, risk management, and claim and benefit administration services to organizations under service agreements.
the
company also participates in state assigned risk pools as a servicing carrier and pool participant.
commercial
automobile.provides coverage for businesses against losses incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties,
property damage to an insured's vehicle and property damage to other vehicles and other property resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks in a business.
commercial
property.provides coverage for loss of or damage to buildings, inventory and equipment from a variety of events, including, among
others, hurricanes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, theft,
table of contents
vandalism,
fires, explosions, terrorism and financial loss due to business interruption resulting from covered property damage. for additional information on terrorism coverages, see
"reinsurancecatastrophe reinsuranceterrorism risk insurance program." property also includes specialized equipment insurance, which provides coverage for loss or damage
resulting from the mechanical breakdown of boilers and machinery, and ocean and inland marine insurance, which provides coverage for goods in transit and unique,
one-of-a-kind exposures.
general
liability.insures businesses against third-party claims arising from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their
operations, including as a result of injuries sustained from products sold. specialized liability policies may also include coverage for directors' and officers' liability arising in their official
capacities, employment practices liability insurance, fiduciary liability for trustees and sponsors of pension, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans, errors and omissions insurance for
employees, agents, professionals and others arising from acts or failures to act under specified circumstances, as well as umbrella and excess insurance.
commercial
multi-peril.provides a combination of the property and liability coverages described in the foregoing product line descriptions.
net retention policy
the following discussion reflects the company's retention policy with respect to the business insurance segment as of january1,
2013. for third-party liability, business insurance generally limits its net retention, through the use of reinsurance, to a maximum of $18.8million per insured, per occurrence. the net
retained amount per risk for property exposures is generally limited to $18.0million per occurrence, after reinsurance. the company generally retains its workers' compensation exposures.
reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per-risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached. the company utilizes facultative
reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. the company may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual
characteristics of the risk.

competition
the insurance industry is represented in the commercial marketplace by many insurance companies of varying size as well as other
entities offering risk alternatives, such as self-insured retentions or captive programs. market competition works within the insurance regulatory framework to set the price charged for
insurance products and the levels of coverage and service provided. a company's success in the competitive commercial insurance landscape is largely measured by its ability to provide insurance and
services, including claims handling and risk control services, at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer, as well as its ability to retain existing customers and to
attract new customers.
select
accounts business is typically written through independent agents and, to a lesser extent, regional brokers and direct writers. both national and regional property and casualty
insurance companies compete in the select accounts market which generally comprises lower-hazard, "main street" business customers. risks are underwritten and priced using standard industry practices
and a combination of proprietary and standard industry product offerings. competition in this market is primarily based on product offerings, service levels, ease of doing business and price. select
accounts has established a strong marketing relationship with its distribution network and has provided this
network with defined underwriting policies, a broad array of products, competitive prices and a highly efficient, automated platform that significantly reduces the time period between quoting a price
on a new policy and issuing that policy. in addition, the company has established centralized service centers to help agents perform many service functions, in return for a fee.
commercial
accounts business has historically been principally written through independent agents and brokers. competitors in this market are primarily national property and casualty
insurance companies that write most classes of business using traditional products and pricing, and regional insurance companies. companies compete based on product offerings, service levels, price
and claim and loss prevention services. efficiency through automation and rapid response time to customer needs is one key to success in this market.
in
the national accounts market, competition is based on price, product offerings, claim and loss prevention services, managed care cost containment, risk management information systems
and collateral requirements. national accounts primarily competes with national property and casualty insurance companies, as well as with other underwriters of property and casualty insurance in the
alternative risk transfer market, such as self-insurance plans, captives managed by others, and a variety of other risk-financing vehicles and mechanisms. the residual market
division competes for state contracts to provide claims and policy management services. national accounts services approximately 33% of the total workers' compensation assigned risk market, making the
company one of the largest servicing carriers in the industry.
there
are several other business groups in business insurance that compete in focused target markets. each of these markets is different and requires unique combinations of industry
knowledge, customized coverage, specialized risk control and loss handling services, along with partnerships with agents and brokers that also focus on these markets. some of these business groups
compete with national carriers with similarly dedicated underwriting and marketing groups, whereas others compete with smaller regional companies. each of these business groups has regional structures
that allow them to deliver personalized service and local knowledge to their customer base. specialized agents and brokers, including managing general agents and wholesale agents, supplement this
strategy. in all of these business groups, the competitive strategy typically is the application of focused industry knowledge to insurance and risk needs.

principal markets and methods of distribution
within the financial, professional& international insurance segment, bond& financial products distributes the vast
majority of its products in the united states through approximately 6,200 of the same independent agencies and brokers that distribute the business insurance segment's products. these independent
agencies and brokers are located throughout the united states. bond& financial products, in conjunction with the business insurance segment, continues to make investments in enhanced
technology utilizing internet-based applications to provide real-time interface capabilities with its independent agencies and brokers. bond& financial products builds
relationships with well-established, independent insurance agencies and brokers. in selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products, bond& financial products
considers, among other attributes, each agency's or broker's profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic fit with its operating and marketing plans. once an agency or broker is
appointed, its ongoing performance is closely monitored. in addition, bond& financial products sells its surety products through independent brokers in the united kingdom.
the
international market distributes its products principally through brokers in the domestic markets of each of the countries in which it operates. it also writes business at lloyd's,
where its products are distributed through lloyd's wholesale and retail brokers. by virtue of lloyd's worldwide licenses, financial, professional& international insurance has access to
international markets across the world.
in late 2008, the company commenced an exclusive relationship with a broker in the republic of ireland that significantly increased the 2009 volume of personal automobile coverage written and also
resulted in the company writing personal household coverages. the company ceased writing business through this relationship in the fourth quarter of 2010 and ceased writing all remaining personal
insurance business in the republic of ireland in the fourth quarter of 2011.
pricing and underwriting
financial, professional& international insurance has developed underwriting and pricing methodologies that incorporate
dedicated underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product development disciplines. this approach is designed to maintain high quality underwriting and pricing discipline, based on an
in-depth knowledge of the specific account, industry or country. underwriters use industry and proprietary data gathered and analyzed over many years to assess and evaluate risks prior to
quotation. the company utilizes both standard industry forms and proprietary forms for the
table of contents
insurance
policies it issues. this methodology enables financial, professional& international insurance to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters.
product lines
the financial, professional& international insurance segment writes the following types of
coverages:
fidelity and
surety.provides fidelity insurance coverage, which protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an
employee, and surety, which is a three-party agreement whereby the insurer agrees to pay a third party or make complete an obligation in response to the default, acts or omissions of an insured.
surety is generally provided for construction performance, legal matters such as appeals, trustees in bankruptcy and probate and other performance bonds.
general
liability.provides coverage for specialized liability exposures as described above in more detail in the "business insurance" section
of this report.
international.provides coverage for employers' liability (similar to workers'
compensation coverage in the united states), public and product liability (the equivalent of general liability), professional indemnity (similar to professional liability coverage), motor (similar to
automobile coverage in the united states), property, surety, marine, aviation, personal accident and kidnap& ransom. marine provides coverage for ship hulls, cargoes carried, private yachts,
marine-related liability, offshore energy, ports and terminals, fine art and terrorism. aviation provides coverage for worldwide aviation risks including physical damage and liabilities for airline,
aerospace, general aviation, aviation war and space risks. personal accident provides financial protection in the event of death or disablement due to accidental bodily injury, while kidnap&
ransom provides financial protection against kidnap, hijack, illegal detention and extortion. while the covered hazards may be similar to those in the u.s. market, the different legal environments can
make the product risks and coverage terms potentially very different from those the company faces in the united states.
other.coverages include property, workers' compensation, commercial automobile and
commercial multi-peril, which are described above in more detail in the "business insurance" section of this report.
net retention policy
the following discussion reflects the company's retention policy with respect to the financial, professional& international
insurance segment as of january1, 2013. in the u.s. operations for third party liability, including but not limited to umbrella liability, professional
liability, directors' and officers' liability, and employment practices liability, financial, professional& international insurance generally limits net retentions, through the use of
reinsurance, to up to $16.6million per policy after the company retains an aggregate layer of expected losses. for surety protection, where insured limits are often significant, the company
generally retains up to $55.0million probable maximum loss (pml) per principal but may retain higher amounts based on the type of obligation, credit quality and other credit risk factors. in
the international operations, per-risk retentions are usually limited up to $18.8 million, after reinsurance. reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in
larger net per risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached. the company utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual
risk basis. the company may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

competition
the competitive landscape in which bond& financial products operates is affected by many of the same factors described
previously for the business insurance segment. competitors in this market are primarily national property and casualty insurance companies that write most classes of business using traditional
products and pricing and, to a lesser extent, regional insurance companies and companies that have developed niche programs for specific industry segments.
bond&
financial products underwrites and markets its products to all sizes of businesses and other organizations, as well as individuals. the company believes that its reputation
for timely and consistent decision making, a nationwide network of local underwriting, claims and industry experts and strong producer and customer relationships, as well as its ability to offer its
customers a full range of products, provides bond& financial products an advantage over many of its competitors and enables it to compete effectively in a complex, dynamic marketplace. the
company believes that the ability of bond& financial products to cross-sell its products to customers of the business insurance and personal insurance segments provides additional
competitive advantages for the company.
international
competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of ireland. companies compete on the basis of price, product
offerings and the level of claim and risk management services provided. the company has developed expertise in various markets in these countries similar to those served in the united states and
provides both property and casualty coverage for these markets.
at
lloyd's, international competes with other syndicates operating in the lloyd's market as well as international and domestic insurers in the various markets where the lloyd's operation
writes business worldwide. competition is again based on price, product and service. the company focuses on lines it believes it can underwrite effectively and profitably with an emphasis on
short-tail insurance lines.
personal insurance
the company's personal insurance segment writes a broad range of property and casualty insurance covering individuals' personal risks.
the primary products of automobile and homeowners insurance are complemented by a broad suite of related coverages.

principal markets and methods of distribution
personal insurance products are distributed primarily through approximately 12,000 active independent agents located throughout the
united states, supported by personnel in 13 sales regions and seven service centers. while the principal markets for personal insurance products continue to be in states along the east coast,
california and texas, the business continues to expand its geographic presence across the united states.
in
selecting new independent agencies to distribute its products, personal insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency's profitability, financial stability, staff experience
and strategic fit with the segment's operating and marketing plans. once an agency is appointed, personal insurance carefully monitors its performance.
agents
can access the company's agency service portal for a number of resources including customer service, marketing and claims management. in addition, agencies can choose to shift the
ongoing service responsibility for personal insurance's customers to one of the company's five customer care centers, where the company provides, on behalf of an agency, a comprehensive array of
customer service needs, including response to billing and coverage inquiries, and policy changes. approximately 1,800 agents take advantage of this service alternative.
personal
insurance also distributes its products through additional channels, including corporations that make the company's product offerings available to their employees primarily
through payroll deduction, consumer associations and affinity groups. personal insurance handles the sales and service for these programs either through a sponsoring independent agent or through two
of the company's call center locations. in addition, since 1995, the company has had a marketing agreement with geico to underwrite homeowners business for their auto customers.
in
2009, the company began marketing its insurance products directly to consumers, largely through online channels. the investment in the direct-to-consumer
initiative generated modest premium volume for personal insurance in recent years, which was consistent with the company's expectations. however, the direct-to-consumer
initiative, while intended to enhance the company's long-term ability to compete successfully in a consumer-driven marketplace, is expected to remain unprofitable for a number of years as
the company continues to develop, test and evaluate this distribution channel.
pricing and underwriting
personal insurance has developed a product management methodology that integrates the disciplines of underwriting, claim, actuarial and
product development. this approach is designed to maintain high quality underwriting discipline and pricing segmentation. proprietary data accumulated over many years is analyzed and personal
insurance uses a variety of risk differentiation models to
table of contents
facilitate
its pricing segmentation. the company's product management area establishes underwriting guidelines integrated with its filed pricing and rating plans, which enable personal insurance to
effectively execute its risk selection and pricing processes.
pricing
for personal automobile insurance is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and by inflation in the cost of automobile repairs, medical care and litigation of
liability claims. pricing in the homeowners business is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and by inflation in the cost of building supplies, labor and household possessions.
in addition to the normal risks associated with any multiple peril coverage, the profitability and pricing of both homeowners and automobile insurance are affected by the incidence of natural
disasters, particularly those related to weather and, for homeowners insurance, earthquakes. insurers writing personal lines property and
casualty policies may be unable to increase prices until some time after the costs associated with coverage have increased, primarily because of state insurance rate regulation. the pace at which an
insurer can change rates in response to increased costs depends, in part, on whether the applicable state law requires prior approval of rate increases or notification to the regulator either before
or after a rate change is imposed. in states with prior approval laws, rates must be approved by the regulator before being used by the insurer. in states having "file-and-use"
laws, the insurer must file rate changes with the regulator, but does not need to wait for approval before using the new rates. a "use-and-file" law requires an insurer to file
rates within a period of time after the insurer begins using the new rate. approximately one-half of the states require prior approval of most rate changes. in addition, changes to methods
of marketing and underwriting in some jurisdictions are subject to state-imposed restrictions, which can make it more difficult for an insurer to significantly manage catastrophe exposures.
the
company's ability or willingness to raise prices, modify underwriting terms or reduce exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public policy, the
evolving political environment, changes in the general economic climate and/or social responsibilities. the company also may choose to write business it might not otherwise write in some states for
strategic purposes, such as improving access to other commercial or personal underwriting opportunities. in choosing to write business in some states, the company also considers the costs and benefits
of those states' residual markets and guaranty funds, as well as other property and casualty business the company writes in those states.
personal
insurance utilizes technology intended to maximize independent agents' ease of doing business with the company. automated quote transactions can be submitted online by
independent agents either through personal insurance's proprietary platform, their own agency management platform or comparative raters (discussed in more detail in the "competition" section that
follows). nearly all new business policies can be issued online either by using the agents' own platform or personal insurance's platform, both of which interface with personal insurance's
underwriting and rating systems to monitor transactions for compliance with the company's underwriting and pricing programs. all online business is subject to consultative review by personal
insurance's in-house underwriters. audits of on-line business are conducted by an internal review team using systematic sampling across all of the company's distribution
channels.
product lines
the primary coverages in personal insurance are personal automobile and homeowners and other insurance sold to individuals. personal
insurance had approximately 7.3million active policies (e.g.,policies-in-force) at december31, 2012.
the
personal insurance segment writes the following types of coverages:
personal automobile provides coverage for liability to others for both
bodily injury and property damage, uninsured motorist protection, and for physical damage to an insured's own vehicle
table of contents
from
collision, fire, flood, hail and theft. in addition, many states require policies to provide first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.
homeowners and other provides protection against losses to dwellings and
contents from a variety of perils (excluding flooding) as well as coverage for personal liability. the company writes homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and tenants, and rental
properties. the company writes coverage for boats and yachts and valuable personal items such as jewelry, and also writes coverages for umbrella liability, identity fraud, and weddings and special
events.
net retention policy
the following describes the company's retention policy with respect to the personal insurance segment as of january1, 2013. the
company generally retains its primary personal auto exposures in their entirety. for personal property insurance, there is an $8.0million maximum retention per risk. personal insurance retains
the first $10.0million of umbrella policies and purchases facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. the company may
also retain amounts greater than those described herein based on the individual characteristics of the risk.

competition
although national companies write the majority of this business, personal insurance also faces competition from many regional and
hundreds of local companies. personal insurance primarily competes based on breadth of product offerings, price, service (including claims handling), ease of doing business, stability of the insurer
and name recognition. personal insurance competes for business within each independent agency since these agencies also offer policies of competing companies. at the agency level, competition is
primarily based on price, service (including claims handling), the level of
table of contents
automation
and the development of long-term relationships with individual agents. in recent years, most independent personal insurance agents have begun utilizing price comparison rating
technology, sometimes referred to as "comparative raters," as a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple companies. because the use of this technology facilitates the process
of generating multiple quotes, the technology has increased price comparison on new business and, increasingly, on renewal business. personal insurance also competes with insurance companies that use
exclusive agents or salaried employees to sell their products, as well as those that employ direct marketing strategies, including the use of toll-free numbers and the internet. see
"item1arisk factorsthe intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability."
claims management
the company's claim functions are managed through its claims services operation, with locations in the united states and in the
countries where it does business. with more than 13,000 employees, claims services employs a diverse group of professionals, including claim adjusters, appraisers, attorneys, investigators, engineers,
accountants, system specialists and training, management and support personnel. approved external service providers, such as investigators, attorneys and, in the rare circumstances when necessary,
independent adjusters and appraisers, are available for use as appropriate.
u.s.
field claim management teams located in 21 claim centers and 58 satellite and specialty-only offices in 45 states are organized to maintain focus on the specific claim
characteristics unique to the businesses within the company's business segments. claim teams with specialized skills, required licenses, resources and workflows are matched to the unique exposures of
those businesses, with local claims management dedicated to achieving optimal results within each segment. the company's home office operations provide additional support in the form of workflow
design, quality management, information technology, advanced management information and data analysis, training, financial reporting and control, and human resources strategy. this structure permits
the company to maintain the economies of scale of a large, established company while retaining the agility to respond promptly to the needs of customers, brokers, agents and underwriters. claims
management for international, while generally provided locally by staff in the respective international locations due to local knowledge of applicable laws and regulations, is also managed by the
company's u.s. claims services organization to leverage that knowledge base and to share best practices.
an
integral part of the company's strategy to benefit customers and shareholders is its continuing industry leadership in the fight against insurance fraud through its investigative
services unit. the company has a nationwide staff of experts who investigate a wide array of insurance fraud schemes using in-house forensic resources and other technological tools. this
staff also has specialized expertise in fire scene examinations, medical provider fraud schemes and data mining. the company also dedicates investigative resources to ensure that violations of law are
reported to and prosecuted by law enforcement agencies.
claims
services uses technology, management information and data analysis to assist the company in reviewing its claim practices and results in order to evaluate and improve its claims
management performance. the company's claims management strategy is focused on segmentation of claims and appropriate technical specialization to drive effective claim resolution. the company
continually monitors its investment in claim resources to maintain an effective focus on claim outcomes and a disciplined approach to continual improvement. the company operates a
state-of-the-art claims training facility, offering hands-on experiential learning to help ensure that its claim professionals are properly trained. in
recent years, the company has invested significant additional resources in many of its claim handling operations and routinely monitors the effect of those investments to ensure a consistent
optimization among outcomes, cost and service.
table of contents
in recent years, claims services refined its catastrophe response strategy to increase the company's ability to respond to a significant catastrophic event using
its own personnel, enabling it to minimize reliance on independent adjusters and appraisers. the company has developed a large dedicated catastrophe response team and trained a large enterprise
response team of existing employees who can be deployed on short notice in the event of a catastrophe that generates claim volume exceeding the capacity of the dedicated catastrophe response team. in
recent years, these internal resources were successfully deployed to respond to a record number of catastrophe claims, including those related to storm sandy in 2012.
reinsurance
the company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. the company cedes to reinsurers
a portion of these risks and pays premiums based upon the risk and exposure of the policies subject to such reinsurance. ceded reinsurance involves credit risk, except with regard to mandatory pools
and associations, and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits. although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the company remains liable as the direct
insurer on all risks reinsured. reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for
uncollectible amounts. the company also holds collateral, including trust agreements, escrow funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. the company monitors the financial
condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically. reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices, the price of their
product offerings and the value of collateral provided. after reinsurance is purchased, the company has limited ability to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer. in addition, in a number of
jurisdictions, particularly the european union and the united kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a
counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority. for additional information concerning reinsurance, see note5 of notes
to the company's consolidated financial statements and "item1arisk factors."
the
company utilizes a variety of reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to large property and casualty losses, including:
facultative reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for all or a portion of the insurance provided by a single
policy and each policy reinsured is separately negotiated;
quota share reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for an agreed-upon fixed percentage of liabilities,
premiums and losses for each policy covered on a pro rata basis;
treaty reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for a specified type or category of risks; and
catastrophe reinsurance, in which the company is indemnified for an amount of loss in excess of a specified retention with
respect to losses resulting from a catastrophic event.
for
a description of reinsurance-related litigation, see note16 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
included
in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which comprise annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal
physical injury
claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company
related to the structured settlement is included in the company's consolidated balance sheet as a liability and as a reinsurance recoverable, as the company retains the contingent liability to the
claimant. in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the
table of contents
company
would be required to make such payments, if and to the extent the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations.
catastrophe reinsurance
catastrophes can be caused by a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes,
hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. catastrophes can also result from a terrorist attack (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or
radiological events), explosions, infrastructure failures or as a consequence of political instability. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. the extent of losses
from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic
areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those areas that are heavily populated. the company generally seeks to manage its exposure to
catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. the company utilizes a general catastrophe reinsurance treaty with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage its
exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes. in addition to the coverage provided under this treaty, the company also utilizes a catastrophe bond program, as well as a northeast catastrophe
reinsurance treaty, to protect against certain losses resulting from catastrophes in the northeastern united states. in addition, the company also has a general catastrophe aggregate
excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty, an earthquake excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty and several reinsurance treaties specific to its international
operations.
general catastrophe reinsurance treaty.the general catastrophe reinsurance treaty covers the accumulation of net property losses
arising out of one
occurrence. the treaty covers all of the company's exposures in the united states and canada and their possessions, and waters contiguous thereto, the caribbean and mexico. the treaty only provides
coverage for terrorism events in limited
circumstances and excludes entirely losses arising from nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.
the
following table summarizes the company's coverage under its general catastrophe reinsurance treaty, effective for the period july1, 2012 through june30, 2013, as well

table of contents
catastrophe bond program.on december18, 2009, longpoint re ii,ltd. (longpoint re ii), a newly formed independent cayman
islands
company licensed as a classb insurer in the cayman islands, completed an offering to unrelated investors of $500million aggregate principal amount of catastrophe bonds. in connection
with the offering, the company and longpoint re ii entered into two reinsurance agreements (covering a three-year and four-year period, respectively), each providing up to
$250million of reinsurance on a proportional basis from certain losses resulting from certain hurricane events in the northeastern united states. the three-year term reinsurance
agreement expired in december 2012, and the remaining reinsurance agreement expires in december 2013.
under
the terms of the remaining reinsurance agreement, the company is obligated to pay annual reinsurance premiums to longpoint re ii for the reinsurance coverage. the reinsurance
agreement utilizes a dual trigger that is based upon the company's covered losses incurred and an index that is created by applying predetermined percentages to insured industry losses in each state
in the covered
area as reported by a third-party service provider. the reinsurance agreement meets the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the guidance for reinsurance contracts.
amounts payable to the company under the reinsurance agreement with respect to any covered event will be determined by the index-based losses from such event (which are designed to approximate the
company's actual losses), but cannot exceed the company's actual losses from such event. the company's actual loss experience may differ from the index-based losses. the principal amount of the
catastrophe bonds will be reduced by any amounts paid to the company under the reinsurance agreement.
the
attachment point for index-based losses and the maximum limit in the program's remaining reinsurance agreement are reset annually using a third-party proprietary computer model to
estimate potential hurricane losses for the entire industry. the purpose of the annual reset is to maintain modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss on the respective catastrophe bonds
equal to their initial modeled probabilities. the attachment point for the indexed-based losses and maximum limit were increased significantly on may1, 2012. through april30, 2013, the
company will be entitled to begin recovering amounts under the reinsurance agreement if the index-based losses in the covered area for a single occurrence reach an initial attachment amount of
$3.500billion. the full $250million coverage amount of the reinsurance agreement is available on a proportional basis until index-based losses reach a maximum $4.358billion
limit. in accordance with the longpoint re ii program, the attachment point for the index-based losses and the maximum limit will be reset again for the period may1, 2013 through
december18, 2013. covered losses under the agreement are limited to the following geographic locations: connecticut, maine, massachusetts, new hampshire, new jersey, new york, pennsylvania,
rhode island and vermont.
as
with any reinsurance agreement, there is credit risk associated with collecting amounts due from reinsurers. with regard to longpoint re ii, the credit risk is mitigated by a
reinsurance trust account that has been funded by longpoint re ii with money market funds that invest solely in direct government obligations backed by the u.s. government with maturities of no more
than 13months. the money market funds must have a principal stability rating of at least aaam by standard& poor's. other permissible investments include repurchase and reverse
repurchase agreements collateralized by direct government obligations backed by the u.s. government with terms of no more than 397 calendar days, and cash.
on
june6, 2012, long point re iiiltd.(long point re iii), a newly formed independent cayman islands company licensed as a classb insurer in the cayman islands,
completed an offering to unrelated investors of $250million aggregate principal amount of catastrophe bonds. in connection with the offering, the company and long point re iii entered into a
three-year reinsurance agreement providing coverage to the company for certain losses from a hurricane in the northeastern united states. long point re iii was structured similarly to
longpoint re ii but does not utilize a dual trigger reinsurance agreement that is based on index-based losses. the business covered by the reinsurance
table of contents
agreement
comprises specified property and related coverages in the company's personal insurance segment, and within the "select accounts" and the "commercial accounts" business groups within the
company's business insurance segment. covered losses under the agreement are limited to the following geographic locations: connecticut, delaware, district of columbia, maine, maryland, massachusetts,
new hampshire, new jersey, new york, pennsylvania, rhode island, virginia and vermont. coverage under the agreement is subject to a $2.0billion retention, after which the company is entitled
to recover 50% of losses, up to a maximum recovery of $250million. the attachment point, maximum limit and insurance percentage are reset annually to maintain modeled probabilities of
attachment and expected loss on the respective catastrophe bonds equal to the initial modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss. similar to longpoint re ii, in long point re iii the
proceeds of the offering were deposited in a reinsurance trust account. in addition, the permitted investments for such proceeds are of the same type as in longpoint re ii in all material respects,
except that in long point re ii the money market funds must always be rated at least aaam by standard& poor's, and in long point re iii, the money market funds must have been rated aaam by
standard& poor's on the issuance date of the bonds and thereafter must be rated by standard& poor's. the reinsurance agreement meets the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance
in accordance with the guidance for reinsurance contracts.
at
the time the agreements were entered into with longpoint re ii and long point re iii, the company evaluated the applicability of the accounting guidance that addresses variable
interest entities or vies. under this guidance, an entity that is formed for business purposes is considered a vie if: (a)the equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability through
voting rights or similar rights to make decisions about an entity's activities that have a significant effect on the entity's operations, or (b)the equity investors do not provide sufficient
financial resources for the entity to support its activities. additionally, a company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses from a vie's activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the
entity's expected residual returns, or both, is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the vie and is required to consolidate the vie in the company's financial statements.
as
a result of the evaluation of the reinsurance agreements with longpoint re ii and long point re iii, the company concluded that they were vies because the conditions described in
items(a) and (b)above were present. however, while longpoint re ii and long point re iii were determined to be vies, the company concluded that it did not have a variable interest in
the entities, as the variability in their results, caused by the reinsurance agreements, is expected to be absorbed entirely by the investors in the catastrophe bonds issued by longpoint re ii and
long point re iii and residual amounts earned by them, if any, are expected to be absorbed by the equity investors (the company has neither an equity nor a residual interest in longpoint re ii or long
point re iii).
accordingly,
the company is not the primary beneficiary of longpoint re ii or long point re iii and does not consolidate those entities in the company's consolidated financial
statements. additionally, because the company has no intention to pursue any transaction that would result in it acquiring interest in and becoming the primary beneficiary of longpoint re ii or long
point re iii, the
consolidation of those entities in the company's consolidated financial statements in future periods is unlikely.
the
company has not incurred any losses that have resulted or are expected to result in a recovery under the longpoint re ii or long point re iii agreements since their inception.
northeast general catastrophe reinsurance treaty.in addition to its general catastrophe treaty and its multi-year catastrophe bond
program, the company also is party to a northeast general catastrophe reinsurance treaty which provides up to $600million of coverage, subject to a $2.25billion retention, for certain
losses arising from hurricanes, tornados, hail storms, earthquakes and winter storm or freeze losses from virginia to maine for the period july1, 2012 through june30, 2013. losses from

event
(occurring over several days) anywhere in the united states, canada, the caribbean and mexico and waters contiguous thereto may be used to satisfy the retention. recoveries under the catastrophe
bond programs (if any) would be first applied to reduce losses subject to this treaty.
general catastrophe aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty.for the period january1, 2013 to december31,
2013, the company has entered into a reinsurance agreement that covers the accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences. for each occurrence, qualifying losses are 90% of
$1.4billion in excess of $100million. the treaty covers aggregate qualifying losses during 2013 for 40% of $1.0billion in excess of $1.5billion. the treaty covers all
of the company's exposures in the united states and canada and their possessions, and waters contiguous thereto, the caribbean and mexico.
earthquake excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty.for the period july1, 2012 through june30, 2013, the company
has entered into an earthquake excess-of-loss treaty that provides for up to $142.5million of coverage, subject to a $125million retention, for earthquake
losses incurred under policies written by the national property business unit in the company's business insurance segment.
international reinsurance treaties.for business underwritten in canada, the united kingdom and republic of ireland and in the
company's operations
at lloyd's, separate reinsurance protections are purchased locally that have lower net retentions more commensurate with the size of the respective local balance sheet. the company conducts an ongoing
review of its risk and catastrophe coverages and makes changes as it deems appropriate.
terrorism risk insurance program.the terrorism risk insurance program (the program) is a federal program administered by the
department of the
treasury that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest. the
program has been authorized through 2014. for a further description of the program, including the company's estimated deductible under the program in 2012, see note5 of notes to the company's
consolidated financial statements in this annual report and "item1arisk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and
adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance."
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment
expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported.
the
company continually refines its reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process that includes review of key assumptions, underlying variables and historical loss experience. the
company reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the periods in which the estimates are changed. in establishing reserves, the company takes into account estimated recoveries
for reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. the reserves are also reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company. for additional information on the process of estimating reserves and
a discussion of underlying variables and risk factors, see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical
accounting estimates."
the
process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables (discussed by product line in the "critical accounting
estimates" section of "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations") are affected by both internal and external events, such as
changes in claims handling
procedures, inflation, judicial trends and legislative changes, among others. the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate.
reserve
table of contents
estimation
difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in the underlying insurance contract (e.g.,claims-made versus occurrence), claim complexity,
the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of the occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the insured event and
when it is actually reported to the insurer). informed judgment is applied throughout the process.
the
company derives estimates for unreported claims and development on reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of historical patterns of loss development by accident year for
each type of exposure and business unit. similarly, the company derives estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses principally from actuarial analyses of historical development patterns of the
relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business and type of exposure. for a description of the company's reserving methods for asbestos and environmental claims, see
"item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsasbestos claims and litigation," and "environmental claims and
litigation."
discounting
the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for most long-term disability and annuity claim payments, primarily
arising from workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies, were discounted to the present value of estimated future payments using a rate of 5% at both
december31, 2012 and 2011. these discounted reserves totaled $2.01billion and $2.20billion at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
claims and claim adjustment expense development table
the table that follows sets forth the year-end reserves from 2002 through 2012 and the subsequent changes in those
reserves, presented on a historical basis. the original estimates, cumulative amounts paid and re-estimated reserves in the table for the years 2002 and 2003 have not been restated to
reflect the acquisition by travelers property casualty corp. (tpc) of the st.paul companies,inc. (spc) in 2004 (referred to hereafter as the merger). the table includes spc reserves
beginning at december31, 2004.
the
data in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the securities and exchange commission (sec). care must be taken to avoid misinterpretation by those
unfamiliar with this information or familiar with other data commonly reported by the insurance industry. the data in the table is not accident year data, but rather a display of 2002 to
2012year-end reserves and the subsequent changes in those reserves.
for
instance, the "cumulative deficiency (redundancy)" shown in the table for each year represents the aggregate amount by which original estimates of reserves as of that
year-end have changed in subsequent years. accordingly, the cumulative deficiency for a year relates only to reserves at that year-end and those amounts are not additive.
expressed another way, if the original reserves at the end of 2002 included $4million for a loss that is finally paid in 2007 for $5million, the $1million deficiency (the
excess of the actual payment of $5million over the original estimate of $4million) would be included in the cumulative deficiencies in each of the years 2002 to 2006 shown in the
accompanying table.
various
factors may distort the re-estimated reserves and cumulative deficiency or redundancy shown in the table. for example, a substantial portion of the cumulative
deficiencies shown in the table arise from claims on policies written prior to the mid-1980s involving liability exposures such as asbestos and environmental claims. in the
post-1984 period, the company has developed more stringent underwriting standards and policy exclusions and has significantly contracted or terminated the writing of these risks. see
"item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsasbestos claims and litigation," and "environmental claims and
litigation."
table of contents
general
conditions and trends that have affected the development of these liabilities in the past will not necessarily recur in the future.
other
factors that affect the data in the table include the discounting of certain reserves (as discussed above) and the use of retrospectively rated insurance policies. for example,
reserves for long-term disability and annuity claim payments (tabular reserves), primarily arising from workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies,
are discounted to reflect the time value of money. apparent deficiencies will continue to occur as the discount on these workers' compensation reserves is accreted at the appropriate interest rates.
also, a portion of national accounts business is underwritten with retrospectively rated insurance policies in which the ultimate loss experience is primarily borne by the insured. for this business,
increases in loss experience result in an increase in reserves and an offsetting increase in amounts recoverable from insureds. likewise, decreases in loss experience result in a decrease in reserves
and an offsetting decrease in amounts recoverable from these insureds. the amounts recoverable on these retrospectively rated policies mitigate the impact of the cumulative deficiencies or
redundancies on the company's earnings but are not reflected in the table.
because
of these and other factors, it is difficult to develop a meaningful extrapolation of estimated future redundancies or deficiencies in loss reserves from the data in the table.

table of contents
for years prior to 2004, the table excludes reserves of spc, which were acquired in the merger on april1, 2004. accordingly, the reserve development (net
reserves for claims and claim adjustment expense re-estimated as of subsequent years less net reserves recorded at the end of the year, as originally estimated) for years prior to 2004
relates only to losses recorded by tpc and does not include reserve development recorded by spc. for 2004 and subsequent years, the table includes spc reserves acquired and subsequent development
recorded on those reserves. at december31, 2004, spc gross reserves were $23,274 million, and net reserves were $15,959 million.
in
december 2008, the company completed the sale of unionamerica holdings limited (unionamerica), which comprised its united kingdom (u.k.)-based runoff insurance and reinsurance
businesses. (unionamerica was acquired in 2004 as part of the merger.) immediately before the sale, the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves of unionamerica totaled $790 million. as a result
of the sale, those obligations ceased being the responsibility of the company and its affiliates. the sale is reflected in the table as a reduction in december31, 2008 net reserves of $790
million and as a $790 million increase in paid losses for each of the years 2004 through 2007 to reflect the transfer (payment) of the reserves to the buyer, resulting in no impact to incurred losses.
the
gross and net cumulative deficiency (redundancy) by calendar year as set forth in the table above includes the following impact of unfavorable prior year reserve development related
to asbestos and environmental claims and claim adjustment expenses, in millions:

reserves on statutory accounting basis
at december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (net of reinsurance) shown in the preceding
table, which are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap reserves), were $22 million lower, $20 million higher and $20 million higher, respectively, than those
reported in the company's respective annual reports filed with insurance regulators, which are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices (statutory reserves).
the
differences between gaap and statutory reserves are primarily due to the differences in gaap and statutory accounting for two items, (1)fees associated with billing of
required reimbursements under large deductible business, and (2)the accounting for retroactive reinsurance. for large deductible business, the company pays the deductible portion of a casualty
insurance claim and then seeks reimbursement from the insured, plus a fee. this fee is reported as fee income for gaap reporting, but as an offset to claim expenses paid for statutory reporting.
retroactive reinsurance balances result from reinsurance placed to cover losses on insured events occurring prior to the inception of a reinsurance contract. for gaap reporting, retroactive
reinsurance balances are included in reinsurance recoverables and result in lower net reserve amounts. statutory accounting practices require retroactive reinsurance balances to be recorded in other
liabilities as contra-liabilities rather than in loss reserves.
asbestos and environmental claims
asbestos and environmental claims are segregated from other claims and are handled separately by the company's special liability group,
a separate unit staffed by dedicated legal, claim, finance and
table of contents
engineering
professionals. for additional information on asbestos and environmental claims, see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationsasbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation."
intercompany reinsurance pooling arrangements
most of the company's insurance subsidiaries are members of an intercompany property and casualty reinsurance pooling arrangement.
pooling arrangements permit the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool's policyholders' surplus rather than just on its own policyholder surplus. under such arrangements,
the members share substantially all insurance business that is written and allocate the combined premiums, losses and expenses.
ratings
ratings are an important factor in assessing the company's competitive position in the insurance industry. the company receives ratings
from the following major rating agencies:a.m. best company (a.m. best), fitch ratings (fitch), moody's investors service (moody's) and standard& poor's corp. (s&p). rating agencies
typically issue two types of ratings for insurance companies: claims-paying (or financial strength) ratings which reflect the rating agency's assessment of an insurer's ability to meet its financial
obligations to policyholders and debt ratings which reflect the rating agency's assessment of a company's prospects for repaying its debts and are considered by lenders in connection with the setting
of interest rates and terms for a company's short- and long-term borrowings. agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and they may be revised or withdrawn
at any time by the rating agency. each agency's rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency's rating. the system and the number of rating categories can vary widely from rating agency
to rating agency. customers usually focus on claims-paying ratings, while creditors focus on debt ratings. investors use both to evaluate a company's overall financial strength. the ratings issued on
the company or its subsidiaries by any of these agencies are announced publicly and are available on the company's website and from the agencies.
a
downgrade in one or more of the company's claims-paying ratings could negatively impact the company's business volumes and competitive position because demand for certain of its
products may be reduced, particularly because some customers require that the company maintain minimum ratings to enter into or renew business with it.
additionally,
a downgrade in one or more of the company's debt ratings could adversely impact the company's ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds, including in
the syndicated bank loan market, and/or result in higher financing costs. for example, downgrades in the company's debt ratings could result in higher interest expense under the company's revolving
credit agreement (under which the cost of borrowing could range from libor plus 100 basis points to libor plus 175 basis points, depending on the company's debt ratings), the company's commercial
paper program, or in the event that the company were to access the capital markets by issuing debt or similar types of securities. see "item7management's discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources" for a discussion of the company's revolving credit agreement and commercial paper program. the company
considers the level of increased cash funding requirements in the event of a ratings downgrade as part of the evaluation of the company's liquidity requirements. the company currently believes that a
one- to two-notch downgrade in its debt ratings would not result in a material increase in interest expense under its existing credit agreement and commercial paper programs.
in addition, the company considers the impact of a ratings downgrade as part of the evaluation of its common share repurchases.

investment operations
the majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid taxable u.s.
government, tax-exempt u.s. municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds. the company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and the
company's investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy its insurance and debt obligations. generally, the expected principal and
interest payments produced by the company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company's insurance reserves. the company's management of the duration of the fixed
maturity investment portfolio, including its use of treasury futures, has produced a duration that is less than the estimated duration of the company's net insurance liabilities. in recent periods,
the estimated average effective duration of the company's portfolio of fixed maturity and short-term security investments has declined, primarily due to the impact of declining market
yields and tightening investment spreads on existing holdings of mortgage-backed securities (both of which impact the assumptions related to optional pre-payments), an increase in
pre-refunded municipal bonds and general portfolio management decisions. in 2013, subject to market conditions, the company plans to increase its short position in u.s. treasury futures,
which it uses to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. the company has also recently experienced an increase in the estimated average duration of its net insurance liabilities,
primarily reflecting the impact of declining market interest rates and, to a lesser degree, an increase in the proportion of workers' compensation insurance reserves as a component of total insurance
reserves. the substantial amount by which the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies
and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.
the
company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships, real estate and insurance
joint ventures, mortgage loans, venture capital (through direct ownership and limited partnerships) and trading securities. these investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also
involve varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.

regulation
u.s. state and federal regulation
trv's insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the various states and jurisdictions in which they transact business. the
extent of regulation varies, but generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state. the regulation,
supervision and administration relate, among other things, to standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on
investments, premium rates, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of
securities for the benefit of policyholders, approval of policy forms and the
regulation of market conduct, including the use of credit information in underwriting as well as other underwriting and claims practices. in addition, many states have enacted variations of
competitive ratemaking laws, which allow insurers to set certain premium rates for certain classes of insurance without having to obtain the prior approval of the state insurance department. state
insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of insurance companies and require the filing of financial and other reports on a quarterly and
annual basis. state insurance regulation continues to evolve in response to the changing economic and business environment as well as efforts by regulators internationally to develop a consistent
approach to regulations. these changes are evidenced by the recent changes that the states have made to provide greater emphasis on understanding an insurer's corporate governance and control
environment, including enterprise risk management (erm), in conducting financial examinations. additional requirements are also expected. for example, the national association of insurance
commissioners (naic) is considering an own risk and solvency assessment (orsa) requirement, which if adopted by states would require insurers to perform
an orsa and, upon request, file an orsa report that describes for the regulators the erm process used by an insurer. see "enterprise risk management" herein for further discussion of the company's
erm. trv's insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact insurance business in all u.s. states, the district of columbia, guam, puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands.
although
the u.s. federal government historically has not regulated the insurance business, in 2010, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the
dodd-frank act) established a federal insurance office within the u.s. department of the treasury. the federal insurance office has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather
data and information regarding the insurance industry and insurers, including conducting a study for submission to the u.s. congress on how to modernize and improve insurance regulation in the u.s.
further, the dodd -frank act gives the federal reserve supervisory authority over a number of nonbank financial services holding companies, including insurance companies, if they are designated by a
two-thirds vote by the newly created financial stability oversight council (the fsoc) as "systemically important financial institutions" (sifi). the fsoc, chaired by the secretary of the
treasury, is a group of federal and state financial regulators and includes an independent insurance expert. based on rules and interpretive guidance adopted by the fsoc, the company does not expect
that it will be designated as a sifi. consistent with that expectation, the company has not received a notice from the fsoc that it will be reviewed for systemic risk designation. nonetheless, it is
possible that the fsoc may change its rules or guidance in the future, or exercise the discretion granted to the council by the dodd-frank act, and conclude that the company is a sifi. if
the company were designated as a sifi, the federal reserve's supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation and could impact requirements regarding the
company's capital, liquidity and leverage as well as its business and investment conduct. as a result of the foregoing, the dodd-frank act, or other additional state and federal regulation
that may be adopted in the future, could impose significant burdens on the company, including impacting the ways in which the company conducts its business, increasing capital requirements or
compliance costs and duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive
table of contents
disadvantage,
particularly relative to other insurers that may not be subject to the same level of regulation.
insurance regulation concerning dividends from insurance subsidiaries.trv's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the
state of
connecticut. the connecticut insurance holding company laws require notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend from an insurance
subsidiary that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurance subsidiary's policyholders' surplus as of the preceding
december31, or the insurance subsidiary's net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding december31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting
practices and by state regulation. this declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.
the
insurance holding company laws of other states in which trv's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive,
limitations on the payment of dividends.
rate and rule approvals.trv's insurance subsidiaries are subject to each state's laws and regulations regarding rate and rule
approvals. the
applicable laws and regulations are used by states to establish standards to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition. an
insurer's ability to increase rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each respective state's requirements.
requirements for exiting geographic markets and/or canceling or nonrenewing policies.several states have laws and regulations which
may impact the
timing and/or the ability of an insurer to either discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in that state. these laws and regulations typically require prior notice, and in some instances
insurance department approval, prior to discontinuing a line of business or withdrawing from that state, and they allow insurers to cancel or non-renew certain policies only for certain
specified reasons.
assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling and reinsurance
arrangements.virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state, including trv's insurance subsidiaries, to bear a portion of the loss
suffered by some claimants because of the insolvency of other insurers. many states also have laws that establish second-injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a
prior condition or injury.
trv's
insurance subsidiaries are also required to participate in various involuntary assigned risk pools, principally involving workers' compensation, automobile insurance, property
windpools in states prone to property damage from hurricanes, and fair plans, which provide various insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that
coverage in the voluntary market.
assessments
may include any charge mandated by statute or regulatory authority that is related directly or indirectly to underwriting activities. examples of such mechanisms include, but
are not limited to, the florida hurricane catastrophe fund, florida citizens property insurance corporation, national workers' compensation reinsurance pool, north carolina beach plan, louisiana
citizens property insurance corporation, and the texas windstorm insurance association. amounts payable or paid as a result of arrangements that are in substance reinsurance, including certain
involuntary pools where insurers are required to assume premiums and losses from those pools, are accounted for as reinsurance (e.g.,national workers' compensation reinsurance pool, north
carolina beach plan). amounts related to assessments from arrangements that are not reinsurance are reported as a component of "general and administrative expenses." for additional information
concerning assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling and reinsurance agreements including state-funding mechanisms, see "item1arisk
factors."
table of contents
insurance regulatory information system.the naic developed the insurance regulatory information system (iris) to help state regulators
identify
companies that may require special attention. financial examiners review annual statements and key financial ratios based on year-end data. these ratios assist state insurance departments
in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. each ratio has an established "usual range" of results. a ratio result falling outside the usual range
of iris ratios, however, is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for
financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. generally, an insurance company will become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual
ranges of four or more of the ratios.
based
on preliminary 2012 iris ratios calculated by the company for its lead insurance subsidiaries, the travelers indemnity company and st.paul fire and marine insurance company
had results outside
the normal range for one iris ratio due to the size of their investments in certain non-fixed maturity securities.
in
2011, the travelers indemnity company and st.paul fire and marine insurance company had results outside the normal range for one iris ratio due to the size of their
investments in certain non-fixed maturity securities. travelers casualty and surety company and the standard fire insurance company had results outside the normal range for two iris ratios
due to the amount of dividends paid to their respective parent. additionally, travelers casualty and surety company had results outside the normal range for one iris ratio due to the amount of
dividends received from its subsidiaries.
management
does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2012 iris ratio results for the lead insurance subsidiaries or their insurance subsidiaries. in all instances in prior
years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required.
risk-based capital (rbc) requirements.the naic has an rbc requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies. the rbc
requirement determines minimum capital requirements and is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. under laws adopted by individual states, insurers having total
adjusted capital less than that required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy.
the
formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital above the rbc requirement. therefore, it is inappropriate
and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. at december31, 2012, all of trv's insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the rbc requirement.
investment regulation.insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality
and
concentration of investments. in general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage
loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications. at december31, 2012, the company was in compliance with these laws and
regulations.
international regulation
trv's insurance underwriting subsidiaries based in the united kingdom, travelers insurance company limited and travelers casualty and
surety company of europe limited, are regulated by the financial services authority (fsa). the fsa's principal objectives are to maintain market confidence, promote public understanding of the
financial system, protect consumers, and fight financial crime. trv's managing agency (travelers syndicate managementltd.) of its lloyd's syndicate is also regulated by the fsa, which has
delegated certain regulatory responsibilities to the council of lloyd's. during 2013, the role of the fsa as insurance regulator will be replaced by two successor bodies, the
table of contents
prudential
regulation authority ("pra"), as prudential regulator, and the financial conduct authority ("fca"), as conduct regulator.
trv's
managing agency is licensed to write business in over 75 jurisdictions throughout the world by virtue of lloyd's international licenses. in each such jurisdiction, trv's managing
agency, as part of lloyd's, is subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that jurisdiction. in addition, trv's managing agency has an underwriting agency in singapore, the operations of which
are regulated by the monetary authority of singapore. a trv subsidiary, travelers casualty and surety company, has a representative office in china. the representative office is regulated by the china
insurance regulatory commission. a trv subsidiary, tci global services,inc., has a liaison office in india. insurance business in india is regulated by the insurance regulatory and development
authority.
trv's
insurance operations in the republic of ireland are conducted through an irish branch of travelers insurance company limited which is regulated by the insurance supervision
departments of the central bank of ireland (as to conduct) and also by the fsa. in canada, the conduct of trv's insurance business is regulated by the office of the superintendent of financial
institutions under provisions of the insurance companies act. trv has an interest in jmalucelli, a joint venture holding company in brazil. jmalucelli's subsidiaries operate in the insurance and
reinsurance business in brazil and are regulated by the superintendencia de seguros privados.
regulators
require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on the type and amount of insurance policies in force.
solvency ii.the european union's executive body, the european commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management
regulations
called solvency ii that would apply to the company's businesses across the european union. solvency ii is currently required to be implemented on january1, 2014; however, the effective
implementation date may be delayed. under solvency ii, it is possible that the u.s. parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator
determines that the subsidiary's capital position is dependent on the parent company and the u.s. company is not already subject to regulations deemed "equivalent" to solvency ii. in addition,
regulators in countries where the company has operations are working with the international association of insurance supervisors (and with the naic in the u.s.) to consider changes to insurance
company supervision, including group supervision. while it is not certain how or if these actions will impact the company, it is currently not expected that the capital management strategies for the
company's u.s. or european union operations will be materially impacted.
international association of insurance supervisors (iais) guidance for determining global systemically important insurers.the iais is
working with
the financial stability board (fsb) created by the g-20 and is developing a methodology for determining whether and which, if any, insurance companies pose a systemic risk to the global
economy. such insurers would be designated "global systemically important insurers" (g-siis) and would likely be subject to higher capital requirements, enhanced supervision or both. the
iais has released for comment proposed methodology for identifying potential g-siis but has not yet decided upon the criteria for or the consequences of such designation. upon finalizing
the assessment methodology and determining the consequences of a g-sii designation, the fsb along with national authorities expect to publish the list of g-siis in april 2013.
see "partiitem1arisk factorsnew regulations outside of the u.s., including in the european union, could adversely impact our results of
operations and limit our growth."
insurance holding company statutes
as a holding company, trv is not regulated as an insurance company. however, since trv owns capital stock in insurance subsidiaries, it
is subject to state insurance holding company statutes, as well as certain other laws, of each of its insurance subsidiaries' states of domicile. all holding company statutes, as well as other laws,
require disclosure and, in some instances, prior approval of material
table of contents
transactions
between an insurance company and an affiliate. the holding company statutes and other laws also require, among other things, prior approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic
insurer, some transactions between affiliates and the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions.
insurance regulations concerning change of control.many state insurance regulatory laws contain provisions that require advance
approval by state
agencies of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled, or, in some cases, having substantial business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled, in that state.
the
laws of many states also contain provisions requiring pre-notification to state agencies prior to any change in control of a non-domestic insurance company
admitted to transact business in that state. while these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, they do authorize issuance of
cease and desist orders with respect to the non-domestic insurer if it is determined that some conditions, such as undue market concentration, would result from the acquisition.
any
transactions that would constitute a change in control of any of trv's insurance subsidiaries would generally require prior approval by the insurance departments of the states in
which the insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or commercially domiciled. they may also require pre-acquisition notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition
notification provisions and in which such insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business.
two
of trv's insurance subsidiaries and its operations at lloyd's are domiciled in the united kingdom. insurers in the united kingdom are subject to change of control restrictions in the
financial services and markets act of 2000 including approval of the fsa, or the successor regulatory authority, the pra (as described above). some of trv's other insurance subsidiaries are domiciled
in, or authorized to conduct insurance business in, canada. authorized insurers in canada are subject to change of control restrictions in section407 of the insurance companies act, including
approval of the office of the superintendent of financial institutions.
these
requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the ownership of common stock, including transactions that could be advantageous to trv's
shareholders.
enterprise risk management
as a large property and casualty insurance enterprise, the company is exposed to many risks. these risks are a function of the
environments within which the company operates. since certain risks can be correlated with other risks, an event or a series of events can impact multiple areas of the company simultaneously and have
a material effect on the company's results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. these exposures require an entity-wide view of risk and an understanding of the potential
impact on all aspects of the company's operations. it also requires the company to manage its risk-taking to be within its risk appetite in a prudent and balanced effort to create and
preserve value for all of the company's stakeholders. this approach to company-wide risk evaluation and management is commonly called enterprise risk management (erm). erm activities
involve both the identification and assessment of a broad range of risks and the execution of synchronized strategies to effectively manage such risks. effective erm also includes the determination of
the company's risk capital needs, which takes into account regulatory requirements and credit rating considerations, in addition to economic and other factors.
erm
at the company is an integral part of its business operations. all risk owners across all functions, all corporate leaders and the board of directors are engaged in erm. erm involves
risk-based analytics, as well as reporting and feedback throughout the enterprise in support of the company's long-term financial strategies and objectives.
table of contents
the
company uses various methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to continually monitor and analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with
them. these analyses and methods are used in making underwriting and reinsurance decisions as part of managing the company's exposure to catastrophic events. in addition to catastrophe modeling and
analysis, the company also models and analyzes its exposure to other extreme events. the company also utilizes proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes to evaluate capital adequacy.
these analytical techniques are an integral component of the company's erm process and further support the company's long-term financial strategies and objectives.
in
addition to the day-to-day erm activities within the company's business units, other key internal risk management functions include the management and
operating committees (comprised of the company's chief executive officer and the other most senior members of management), the enterprise and underwriting risk committees of management, the credit
committee, the chief compliance officer, the business conduct officer, the corporate actuarial group, the corporate audit group, the accounting policy group, the enterprise underwriting group and many
others. a senior executive oversees the erm process. the mission of this executive is to facilitate risk assessment and to collaborate in implementing effective risk management strategies throughout
the company. another strategic erm objective of this executive includes working across the company to enhance effective and realistic risk modeling capabilities as part of the company's overall effort
to understand and manage its portfolio of risks to be within its risk appetite. board oversight of erm is provided by the risk committee of the board of directors, which reviews the strategies,
processes and controls pertaining to the company's insurance operations and oversees the implementation, execution and performance of the company's erm program.
the
company's erm efforts build upon the foundation of an effective internal control environment. erm expands the internal control objectives of effective and efficient operations,
reliable financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to fostering, leading and supporting an integrated, risk-based culture within the company that focuses on
value creation and preservation. however, the company can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that these objectives will be met. further, the design of any risk management or control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. as a result, the possibility of material financial loss remains in spite
of the company's significant erm efforts. an investor should carefully consider the risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report, including the discussions included in
"item1arisk factors," "item7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk," and "item8financial statements and
supplementary data."
other information
customer concentration
in the opinion of the company's management, no material part of the business of the company and its subsidiaries is dependent upon a
single customer or group of customers, the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the company, and no one customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for 10% or more
of the company's consolidated revenues.
employees
at december31, 2012, the company had approximately 30,500 employees. the company believes that its employee relations are
satisfactory. none of the company's employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

glossary of selected insurance terms
accident year
the annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.
adjusted unassigned surplus
unassigned surplus as of the most recent statutory annual report reduced by twenty-five percent of that year's
unrealized appreciation in value or revaluation of assets or unrealized profits on investments, as defined in that report.
admitted insurer
a company licensed to transact insurance business within a state.
table of contents
agent
a licensed individual who sells and services insurance policies, receiving a commission from the insurer for selling the
business and a fee for servicing it. an independent agent represents multiple insurance companies and searches the market for the best product for its client.
annuity
a contract that pays a periodic benefit over the remaining life of a person (the annuitant), the lives of two or
more persons or for a specified period of time.
assigned risk pools
reinsurance pools which cover risks for those unable to purchase insurance in the voluntary market. possible
reasons for this inability include the risk being too great or the profit being too small under the required insurance rate structure. the costs of the risks associated with these pools are charged back to insurance carriers in proportion to their
direct writings.
assumed reinsurance
insurance risks acquired from a ceding company.
average value analysis
a conventional actuarial method used to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an
accident year/product line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the unpaid losses.
the basic premise of the method is that average claim values are stable and predictable over time for a
particular cohort of claims. the method is utilized most often where ultimate claim counts are known or reliably estimable fairly early after the start of an accident year and average values are expected to be fairly predictable from one year to the
next.
the method comes up with an estimate of ultimate claims counts by accident year cohort, and multiplies it by an
estimate of average claim value by accident year cohort, with multiple methods used to estimate these average claim values.
book value per share
total common shareholders' equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding.
bornhuetter-ferguson method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an accident
year/product line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the outstanding losses.
table of contents
the basic premise of the method is that the historical ratio of additional claim activity to earned premium for a given product
line component/age-to-age period is stable and predictable. it implicitly assumes that the actual activity to date for past periods for that cohort is not a credible predictor of future activity for that cohort, or at least is not credible enough to
override the "a priori" assumption as to future activity. it may be applied to either paid or case incurred claim data. it is used most often where the claim data is sparse and/or volatile and for relatively young cohorts with low volumes and/or data
credibility.
to illustrate, the method may assume that the ratio of additional paid losses from the 12 to 24month
period for an accident year is 10% of the original "a priori" expected losses for that accident year. the original "a priori" expected losses are typically based on the original loss ratio assumption for that accident year, with subsequent adjustment
as facts develop.
the ultimate losses equal actual activity to date plus the expected values for future periods.
broker
one who negotiates contracts of insurance or reinsurance on behalf of an insured party, receiving a commission
from the insurer or reinsurer for placement and other services rendered.
capacity
the percentage of surplus, or the dollar amount of exposure, that an insurer or reinsurer is willing or able to
place at risk. capacity may apply to a single risk, a program, a line of business or an entire book of business. capacity may be constrained by legal restrictions, corporate restrictions or indirect restrictions.
captive
a closely-held insurance company whose primary purpose is to provide insurance coverage to the company's owners
or their affiliates.
case-incurreddevelopment method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an accident
year/product line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the unpaid losses.
the approach is the same as that described in this glossary under the "paid loss development method," but based
on the growth in cumulative case-incurred losses (i.e.,the sum of claim-adjustor incurred estimates for claims in the cohort) rather than paid losses. the basic premise of the method is that cumulative case incurred losses for a given cohort of
claims will grow in a stable, predictable pattern from year-to-year, based on the age of the cohort.
case reserves
claim department estimates of anticipated future payments to be made on each specific individual reported
claim.
table of contents
casualty insurance
insurance which is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e.,not the insured, and the
legal liability imposed on the insured resulting therefrom. it includes, but is not limited to, employers' liability, workers' compensation, public liability, automobile liability, personal liability and aviation liability insurance. it excludes
certain types of losses that by law or custom are considered as being exclusively within the scope of other types of insurance, such as fire or marine.
catastrophe
a severe loss, resulting from a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other
windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. catastrophes can also result from a terrorist attack (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events),
explosions, infrastructure failures or as a consequence of political instability. each catastrophe has unique characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount. their effects are included in net and operating income and
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence. a catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.
catastrophe loss
loss and directly identified loss adjustment expenses from catastrophes, and related reinsurance reinstatement
premiums.
catastrophereinsurance
a form of excess-of-loss reinsurance which, subject to a specified limit, indemnifies the ceding company for the
amount of loss in excess of a specified retention with respect to an accumulation of losses resulting from a catastrophic event. the actual reinsurance document is called a "catastrophe cover." these reinsurance contracts are typically designed to
cover property insurance losses but can be written to cover casualty insurance losses such as from workers' compensation policies.

reserves are insufficient to pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. where the deficiency is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of deficiency (or even the finding of whether or not a deficiency exists) may change as
new information becomes available.
demand surge
significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for
those materials and services, commonly as a result of a large catastrophe resulting in significant widespread property damage.
direct written premiums
the amounts charged by an insurer to insureds in exchange for coverages provided in accordance with the terms of
an insurance contract. the amounts exclude the impact of all reinsurance premiums, either assumed or ceded.
earned premiums or premiums earned

negotiated.
fair access to insurance
requirements (fair) plan

the regular (voluntary) market. fair plans are set up on a state-by-state basis to cover only those risks in that state. for more information, see "residual market (involuntary business)."
fidelity and surety programs
fidelity insurance coverage protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an
employee. surety is a three-party agreement in which the insurer agrees to pay a third party or make complete an obligation in response to the default, acts or omissions of an insured.
gaap combined ratio
the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. a combined ratio under 100% generally
indicates an underwriting profit. a combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss.

the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.
ground-up analysis
a method to estimate ultimate claim costs for a given cohort of claims such as an accident year/product line
component. it involves analyzing the exposure and claim activity at an individual insured level and then through the use of deterministic or stochastic scenarios and/or simulations, estimating the ultimate losses for those insureds. the total losses
for the cohort are then the sum of the losses for each individual insured.
in practice, the method is sometimes simplified by performing the individual insured analysis only for the
larger insureds, with the costs for the smaller insureds estimated via sampling approaches (extrapolated to the rest of the smaller insured population) or aggregate approaches (using assumptions consistent with the ground-up larger insured
analysis).
guaranteed cost products
an insurance policy where the premiums charged will not be adjusted for actual loss experience during the
covered period.

paid development method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an accident
year/product line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the unpaid losses.
the basic premise of the method is that cumulative paid losses for a given cohort of claims will grow in a
stable, predictable pattern from year-to-year, based on the age of the cohort. these age-to-age growth factors are sometimes called "link ratios."
for example, if cumulative paid losses for a product line xyz for accident year 2004 were $100 as of
december31, 2004 (12months after the start of that accident year), then grew to $120 as of december31, 2005 (24months after the start), the link ratio for that accident year from 12 to 24months would be 1.20. if the link
ratio for other recent accident years from 12 to 24months for that product line were also at or around 1.20, then the method would assume a similar result for the most recent accident year, i.e.,that it too would have its cumulative paid
losses grow 120% from the 12month to 24month valuation.
this is repeated for each age-to-age period into the future until the age-to-age link ratios for future periods
are assumed to be 1.0 (i.e.,the age at which cumulative losses are assumed to have stopped growing).
table of contents
a given accident year's cumulative losses are then projected to ultimate by multiplying current cumulative losses by successive
age-to-age link ratios up to that future age where growth is expected to end. for example, if growth is expected to end at 60months, then the ultimate indication for an accident year with cumulative losses at 12months equals those losses
times a 12 to 24month link ratio, times a 24 to 36month link ratio, times a 36 to 48month link ratio, times a 48 to 60month link ratio.
advanced applications of the method include adjustments for changing conditions during the historical period and
anticipated changes in the future.

subject to change based on a number of factors, including changes in actuarial estimates.
reportedclaimdevelopment method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate claim counts for a given cohort of claims such as an
accident year/product line component. if the reported-to-date counts are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate counts, the result is an indication of the ibnr counts.
the approach is the same as that described in this glossary under the "paid loss development method", but based
on the growth in cumulative claim counts rather than paid losses. the basic premise of the method is that cumulative claim counts for a given cohort of claims will grow in a stable, predictable pattern from year-to-year, based on the age of the
cohort.
residualmarket(involuntary business)
insurance market which provides coverage for risks for those unable to purchase insurance in the voluntary
market. possible reasons for this inability include the risks being too great or the profit potential too small under the required insurance rate structure. residual markets are frequently created by state legislation either because of lack of
available coverage such as: property coverage in a windstorm prone area or protection of the accident victim as in the case of workers' compensation. the costs of the residual market are usually charged back to the direct insurance carriers in
proportion to the carriers' voluntary market shares for the type of coverage involved.

item1a.risk factors
you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report, including our consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto.
catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to
raise
capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes
can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis and volcanic
eruptions. catastrophes can also be man-made, such as a terrorist attack (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), explosions, infrastructure
failures or a consequence of political instability. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposures in the united states, which include, but are not limited to:
hurricanes from maine through texas; tornadoes throughout the central, mid-atlantic and southeastern regions of the united states; earthquakes in california, the new madrid region and the
pacific northwest region of north america; wildfires, particularly in the southwest; and terrorism in major cities in the united states. in addition, our international operations subject us to
catastrophe exposures in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of ireland, as well as to a variety of world-wide catastrophe exposures through our lloyd's operations, and in brazil
through our joint venture investment.
the
incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that both the frequency and severity of natural and man-made catastrophic events
could increase. moreover, we could experience more than one highly severe catastrophic event in any given period.
some
scientists believe that in recent years changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to
future trends and exposures. for example, in recent years hurricane activity has impacted areas further inland than previously experienced, thus expanding our overall hurricane exposure. additionally,
both the frequency and severity of tornadoes and hail storms have increased in recent years.
table of contents
all of the catastrophe modeling tools that we use, or that we rely on from outside parties, to help manage certain of our catastrophe exposures are based on
assumptions and judgments that are subject to error and mis-estimation and may produce estimates that are materially different than actual results. in addition, compared to models for
hurricanes, models for earthquakes are less reliable due to there being a more limited number of significant historical events to analyze, while models for tornadoes and hail storms are newer and may
be even less reliable due to the highly random geographic nature and size of these events. as a result, models for earthquakes and especially for tornado and hail storms may have even greater
difficulty predicting risks and estimating losses. further, changes in climate conditions could cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively
evaluate and manage catastrophe risk. see "we may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results" below as well as
"item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscatastrophe modeling" and "changing climate conditions."
the
extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. increases in the value
and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future. for example, the specific geographic
location impacted by tornadoes is inherently random and unpredictable and the specific location impacted by a tornado may or may not be highly populated and may or may not have a high concentration of
our insured exposures.
states
have from time to time passed legislation, and regulators have taken action, that have the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk, such as
legislation prohibiting insurers from reducing exposures or withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas or mandating that insurers participate in residual markets. participation in residual market
mechanisms has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant losses or assessments to insurers, including us, and, in certain states, those losses or assessments may not be commensurate with
our direct catastrophe exposure in those states. if our competitors leave those states having residual market mechanisms, remaining insurers, including us, may be subject to significant increases in
losses or assessments following a catastrophe. in addition, following catastrophes, there are sometimes legislative and administrative initiatives and court decisions that seek to expand insurance
coverage for catastrophe claims beyond the original intent of the policies or seek to prevent the application of deductibles. also, our ability to adjust terms, including deductible levels, or to
increase pricing to the extent necessary to offset rising costs of catastrophes, particularly in the personal insurance segment, requires approval of regulatory authorities of certain states. our
ability or our willingness to manage our catastrophe exposure by raising prices, modifying underwriting terms or reducing exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public
policy, the evolving political environment, changes in the general economic climate and/or social responsibilities. we also may choose to write business in catastrophe-prone areas that we might not
otherwise write for strategic purposes, such as improving our access to other underwriting activities.
there
are also factors that impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves related to hurricanes
can be affected by the inability to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the
information available to establish the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind;
evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage; business
interruption costs; and reinsurance collectability. in recent years, increased late reporting of weather-related losses by claimants, particularly losses from hail damage, has led to higher costs than
we previously expected. the timing of a catastrophe's occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to us in estimating claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves for that reporting period. the
table of contents
estimates
related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge and additional information becomes available.
exposure
to catastrophe losses or actual losses resulting from a catastrophe could adversely affect our financial strength and claims-paying ratings and could impair our ability to raise
capital on acceptable terms or at all. also, as a result of our exposure to catastrophe losses or actual losses following a catastrophe, rating agencies may further increase capital requirements,
which may require us to raise capital to maintain our ratings or adversely affect our ratings. a ratings downgrade could hurt our ability to compete effectively or attract new business. in addition,
catastrophic events could cause us to
exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely impact the cost and availability of reinsurance. such events can also impact the credit of our reinsurers. for a discussion of our
catastrophe reinsurance coverage, see "item1businessreinsurancecatastrophe reinsurance." catastrophic events could also adversely impact the credit of
the issuers of securities, such as states or municipalities, in whom we have invested.
in
addition, coverage in our reinsurance program for terrorism is limited. although the terrorism risk insurance program (the program) provides benefits in the event of certain acts of
terrorism, those benefits are subject to a deductible and other limitations. under this program, once our losses exceed 20% of our commercial property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding
calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for 85% of our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism which exceed this deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100 billion.
our estimated deductible under the program is $2.26 billion for 2013. in addition, because the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to
specific circumstances. it is also possible that future legislative action could change the program. the program is due to expire at the end of 2014, unless extended.
because
of the risks set forth above, catastrophes such as those caused by various natural events or man-made events such as a terrorist attack, including "unconventional" acts of
terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. further, while we seek
to manage our exposure to man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of
one or more man-made catastrophic events involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological means.
during or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected.over the
past six years, worldwide financial markets have experienced significant disruptions and, during a portion of this period, the united states and many other economies experienced a prolonged economic
downturn, resulting in heightened credit risk, reduced valuation of investments and decreased economic activity. while economic conditions have generally stabilized, there is continued uncertainty
regarding the duration and strength of any economic recovery. even if growth continues, it may be at a slow rate for an extended period of time, and other economic conditions, such as the residential
and commercial real estate environment and employment rates, may continue to be weak.
in
addition, while inflation has recently been limited and that trend may continue, it is possible that steps taken by the federal government to stabilize financial markets and improve
economic conditions could lead to an inflationary environment. furthermore, financial markets may again experience significant and prolonged disruption.
economic
uncertainty has been exacerbated in recent years by the increased potential for default by one or more european sovereign debt issuers, the potential partial or complete
dissolution of the eurozone and its common currency and the negative impact of such events on global financial institutions and capital markets generally. actions or inactions of european governments
may impact these actual or perceived risks. in the u.s. during 2011, one rating agency downgraded the u.s.'s
table of contents
long-term
debt credit rating from aaa. future actions or inactions of the united states government, including a failure to increase the government debt limit or a shutdown of the federal
government, could increase the actual or perceived risk that the u.s. may not ultimately pay its obligations when due and may disrupt financial markets, including capital markets. further, general
uncertainty regarding the u.s. federal budget and taxes has added to the uncertainty regarding economic conditions generally.
if
economic conditions remain weak or deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial
position and/or liquidity. several of the risk factors discussed below identify risks that result from, or are exacerbated by, an economic slowdown or financial disruption. these include risks
discussed below related to our investment portfolio, reinsurance arrangements, other credit exposures, our estimates of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, emerging claim and coverage
issues, the competitive environment, regulatory developments and the impact of rating agency actions. you should also refer to "item7management's discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operation", particularly the "outlook" section.
many
of these risks could materialize, and our financial results could be negatively impacted, even after the end of an economic downturn or financial disruption. during or following an
economic downturn, lower levels of economic activity could reduce (and historically have reduced) exposure changes at renewal. they also could adversely impact (and historically have adversely
impacted) audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written, particularly in our business units within business insurance, which could
adversely impact our written premiums. in addition, because earned premiums lag written premiums, our results can be adversely affected after general economic conditions have improved. an inflationary
environment (which may follow government efforts to stabilize the economy) may also, as we discuss below, adversely impact our loss costs and could adversely impact the valuation of our investment
portfolio. finally, as a result of financial market disruption, we may, as discussed below, face increased regulation.
if actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, our
financial results could be materially and adversely affected.claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not
represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, generally utilizing actuarial expertise
and projection techniques, at a given accounting date.
the
process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables can be affected by both
internal and external events, such as: changes in claims handling procedures; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures on medical costs and auto and home repair costs;
economic conditions including general inflation; legal trends and legislative changes; and varying judgments and viewpoints of the individuals involved in the estimation process, among others. the
impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimation difficulties also differ
significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting
lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer).
as
discussed above, it is possible that steps taken by the federal government to stabilize the economy could lead to an inflationary environment, which could in turn lead to an increase
in our loss costs. the impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines of business that are considered "long tail", such as general liability, as they require a relatively
long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. in addition, inflationary pressures in medical costs
table of contents
may
be increased by the healthcare reform legislation. the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may also be more difficult during times of adverse or uncertain economic
conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or
increased frequency of small claims or delays in the reporting of claims.
we
continually refine our claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and
settled and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. business judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to
multiple sets of data and analyses. different experts may choose different assumptions when faced with material uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas
of focus. hence, such experts may at times produce estimates materially different from each other. this risk may be exacerbated in the context of an acquisition. experts providing input to the various
estimates and underlying assumptions include actuaries, underwriters, claim personnel and lawyers, as well as other members of management. therefore, management may have to consider varying individual
viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
we
attempt to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established or reviewed. due to the inherent uncertainty
underlying claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, the final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses will likely be higher or lower than the
related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than is currently reserved.
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities resulting from one insured event, or an accumulation of insured events, may exceed the current related reserves. in
addition, our estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could
materially and adversely affect our results of operations and/or our financial position.

our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses.investment returns are an important part
of our
overall profitability. fixed maturity and short-term investments comprised approximately 93% of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december31, 2012. changes in interest rates
caused by inflation or other factors (inclusive of credit spreads) affect the carrying value of our fixed maturity investments and returns on our fixed maturity and short-term investments. a decline
in interest rates reduces the returns available on short-term investments and new fixed maturity investments (including those purchased to re-invest maturities from the existing portfolio), thereby
negatively impacting our net investment income, while rising interest rates reduce the market value of existing fixed maturity investments. interest rates in recent periods have been at or near
historically low levels, and it is possible that rates may remain at low levels for a prolonged period. the value of our fixed maturity and short-term investments is subject to the risk
that certain investments may default or become impaired due to a deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities held in our portfolio, or due to a deterioration in
the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an issuer's payments of such investments. such defaults and impairments could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment
losses. during an economic downturn, fixed maturity and short-term investments could be subject to a higher risk of default.
table of contents
our
fixed maturity investment portfolio is invested, in substantial part, in obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal
bond portfolio). notwithstanding the relatively low historical rates of default on many of these obligations and notwithstanding that we typically seek to invest in high-credit-quality securities
(including those with structural protections such as being secured by dedicated or pledged sources of revenue), our municipal bond portfolio could be subject to default or impairment. in
particular:
the prolonged economic downturn that began in 2008, and the limited economic recovery that has followed, has resulted in
many states and local governments operating under deficits or projected deficits. the severity and duration of these deficits could have an adverse impact on the collectability and valuation of our
municipal bond portfolio. these deficits may be exacerbated by the impact of unfunded pension plan obligations or by declining municipal tax bases and revenues in times of financial stress.
some issuers may be unwilling to increase tax rates, or to reduce spending, to fund interest or principal payments on
their municipal bonds, or may be unable to access the municipal bond market to fund such payments. the risk of widespread defaults may increase if some issuers voluntarily choose to default, instead
of implementing difficult fiscal measures, and the actual or perceived consequences (such as reduced access to capital markets) are less severe than expected.
the risk of widespread defaults may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit states, municipalities
and political subdivisions to file for bankruptcy protection where they were not permitted before. in addition, the collectability and valuation of municipal bonds may be adversely affected if there
are judicial interpretations in a bankruptcy or other proceeding that lessen the value of structural protections. for example, debtors may challenge the effectiveness of structural protections thought
to be provided by municipal securities backed by a dedicated source of revenue. the collectability and valuation may also be adversely affected if there are judicial interpretations in a bankruptcy or
other proceeding that question the payment priority of municipal bonds.
our
portfolio has also benefited from tax exemptions and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as
foreign tax credits). changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio. see "changes in u.s. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate
could adversely impact us" below.
our
investment portfolio includes: residential mortgage-backed securities; collateralized mortgage obligations; pass-through securities and asset-backed securities collateralized by
sub-prime mortgages; commercial mortgage-backed securities; and wholly-owned real
estate, real estate partnerships and mortgage loans, all of which could be adversely impacted by further declines in real estate valuations and/or financial market disruption. in addition, the
potential for protracted disruption and/or suspension of foreclosure practices could also impact the returns on certain of these portfolios.
we
also invest a portion of our assets in equity securities, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships. from time to time, we may also invest in
other types of non-fixed maturity investments, including commodities. all of these asset classes are subject to greater volatility in their investment returns than fixed maturity investments. general
economic conditions, changes in applicable tax laws and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our non-fixed maturity investments and the realization of net investment
income, and/or result in realized investment losses. as a result of these factors, we may realize reduced returns on these investments, incur losses on sales of these investments and be required to
write down the value of these investments, which could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses.
table of contents
our
investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are
illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e.,the carrying amount) of the portion of the investment portfolio that is carried at fair value as reflected in our
financial statements is not reflective of prices at which actual transactions could occur.
given
that economic and market conditions are highly uncertain, we may, depending on circumstances in the future, make changes to the mix of investments in our investment portfolio.
these changes may impact the duration, volatility and risk of our investment portfolio.
because
of the risks set forth above, the value of our investment portfolio could decrease, we could experience reduced net investment income and we could experience realized and/or
unrealized investment losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation.
with
regard to asbestos claims, we have received and continue to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from policyholders (including others seeking coverage under a policy).
factors underlying these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the continued focus by plaintiffs on previously peripheral defendants. the focus on these
defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. the bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has prompted
plaintiffs to aggressively seek out potential new defendants and has caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but who remain in the tort system.
currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those
who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. this trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries,
along with the focus on previously peripheral defendants, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payments experienced by us.
we
also continue to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or a
portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. in these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated
as a separate occurrence under the policy. it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor
and our other defenses are not successful, our coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of
asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. accordingly, although we have seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the
ultimate cost of these claims.
further,
in addition to asbestos claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including us, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with
respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. it is possible that the filing of other direct actions against
insurers, including us, could be made in the future. it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against
insurers based on novel legal theories of liability.
with
regard to environmental claims, we have received and continue to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged
disposition of toxic substances. mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory
table of contents
efforts
aimed at environmental remediation. for instance, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties
as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases
of hazardous substances. this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. liability under
cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties.
the
company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. the company believes that some court decisions
have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction.
uncertainties
surrounding the final resolution of these asbestos and environmental claims continue, and it is difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims and related
litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without
limitation:
the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation;
any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants;
a further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is
anticipated;
the role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued;
the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental
claims in a manner inconsistent with our previous assessment of these claims;
the number and outcome of direct actions against us;
future developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims;
the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy
limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers; and
uncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants.
it
is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. this
environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or
judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near
completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations
often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective.
while
the ongoing evaluation of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded
theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in
liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. see the "asbestos claims and litigation" and
"environmental claims and litigation" sections of "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." also see
"item3legal proceedings."
table of contents
we are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or
substances.in addition to asbestos and environmental claims, we face exposure to other types of mass tort claims, including claims related to exposure to
potentially harmful products or substances, including lead paint, silica and welding rod fumes. establishing claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for mass tort claims is subject to
uncertainties because of many factors, including expanded theories of liability, disputes concerning medical causation with respect to certain diseases, geographical concentration of the lawsuits
asserting the claims and the potential for a large rise in the total number of claims without underlying epidemiological developments suggesting an increase in disease rates. moreover, evolving
judicial interpretations regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liabilities, as well as the application of
insurance coverage to these claims, make it difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims.
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, our estimate of claims and claim
adjustment expenses may change, and such change could be material. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially
and adversely affect our results of operations.
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and
other
environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge. these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our
underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to:
judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability;
plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including us, in purported class action litigation relating to
claims-handling and other practices;
claims relating to construction defects, which often present complex coverage and damage valuation questions;
claims under directors'& officers' insurance policies relating to losses from involvement in financial market
activities, such as mortgage or financial product origination, distribution, structuring or servicing and foreclosure procedures; failed financial institutions; fraud, including those related to
investment management businesses; possible accounting irregularities; and corporate governance issues;
the assertion of "public nuisance" or similar theories of liability, pursuant to which plaintiffs seek to recover monies
spent to administer public health care programs, abate hazards to public health and safety and/or recover damages purportedly attributable to a "public nuisance";
claims relating to molestation by an employee of an insured;
medical developments that link health issues to particular causes (for example, cumulative trauma), resulting in liability
or workers' compensation claims;
claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies; and
claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions, including higher frequency and severity of weather-related
events.
in
some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies. as a result, the full extent of liability under our
insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued.
table of contents
in
addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to deem by statute the existence of a covered occurrence, to
extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business.
the
effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of
operations.
the intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.the
property and
casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, and we believe that it will remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. we compete with both domestic and foreign insurers which may offer
products at prices and on terms that are not consistent with our economic standards in an effort to maintain or increase their business. the competitive environment in which we operate could also be
impacted by current general economic conditions, which could reduce the volume of business available to us as well as to our competitors. in addition, the competitive environment could be impacted by
changes in customer preferences, including customer
demand for direct distribution channels. see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationoutlook."
in
personal insurance, the use of comparative rating technologies has impacted, and may continue to impact, our business as well as the industry as a whole. a substantial amount of the
company's personal insurance new business is written after an agent compares quotes using comparative rating technologies, a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple
companies. because the use of this technology, whether by agents or directly by customers, facilitates the process of generating multiple quotes, the technology has increased price comparison on new
business and, increasingly, on renewal business. it also has resulted in an increase in the level of quote activity and a lower percentage of quotes that result in new business from customers, and
these trends may continue or accelerate. if we are not able to operate with a competitive cost structure or accurately estimate and price for claims and claim adjustment expenses, our underwriting
margins could be adversely affected over time. additionally, there is potential for similar technology to be used to access comparative rates for small commercial business. agents, brokers or other
third parties may also create alternate distribution channels for personal or commercial business, such as insurance exchanges, that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.
other
technological changes may present competitive risks. for example, innovations, such as telematics and other usage-based methods of determining premiums, can impact product design
and pricing and may become an increasingly important competitive factor. other potential technological changes, such as driverless cars, could disrupt the demand for our products from current
customers, and we may not be able to respond effectively. in addition, our competitive position could be impacted by our ability to deploy, in a cost effective manner, technology that collects and
analyzes a wide variety of data points (so-called "big data" analysis) to make underwriting or other decisions. see also "our business success and profitability depend, in part, on
effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology" below.
in
recent years, we have undertaken various actions to improve our underwriting margins on many of our insurance products, and competitive dynamics may impact the success of these
efforts. these efforts include seeking improved rates, as well as improved terms and conditions, and also include other initiatives, such as reducing operating expenses and acquisition costs. these
efforts may not be successful and/or may result in lower retention and new business levels and therefore lower business volumes. in addition, if our underwriting is not effective, efforts to increase
rates could also lead to "adverse selection", whereby accounts retained have higher losses, and are less profitable, than accounts lost. for more detail, see "item7management's
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationoutlook.
table of contents
in
particular, in our agency automobile line of business, we have undertaken various actions to improve our underwriting margins, which have been negatively impacted by various factors.
these factors include (i)changes in customer preferences and demand for direct distribution channels, (ii)utilization of comparative rating technologies by agents, (iii)other
technological changes, as described above, and (iv)loss cost increases that have exceeded earned rate increases. if our strategies to increase profitability through the actions described above
are not effective, we may need to explore other actions or initiatives to improve our competitive position and profitability in this line of business.
overall,
our competitive position in our various businesses is based on many factors, including but not limited to our:
ability to profitably price our business, retain existing customers and obtain new business;
premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered (including the ability to design customized
programs);
agent, broker and client relationships;
ability to keep pace relative to our competitors with changes in technology and information systems;
speed of claims payment;
ability to provide our products and services in a cost effective manner;
perceived overall financial strength and corresponding ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;
reputation, experience and qualifications of employees;
geographic scope of business; and
local presence.
we
may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. if competition limits our ability to retain existing business or write new business at
adequate rates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. see "competition" sections of the discussion on business segments in "item1business."
we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at
all.although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. as a result,
ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. accordingly, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.
in
the past, certain reinsurers have ceased writing business and entered into runoff. some of our reinsurance claims may be disputed by the reinsurers, and we may ultimately receive
partial or no payment. this is a particular risk in the case of claims that relate to insurance policies written many years ago, including those relating to asbestos and environmental claims. in
addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the european union and the united kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less
creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority.
included
in reinsurance recoverables are certain amounts related to structured settlements. structured settlements comprise annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to
settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant
table of contents
portion.
in cases where we did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables as we retain the contingent liability to the claimant. in the
event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, we would be required to make such payments if and to the extent not paid by state guaranty associations.
many
reinsurance companies and life insurance companies were negatively impacted by the financial markets disruption and the economic downturn over the past several years. a number of
these companies, including certain of those with which we conduct business or to which we otherwise have credit exposure, were downgraded by various rating agencies during this time period. for a
discussion of our top reinsurance groups by reinsurance recoverable and the top five groups by amount of structured settlements provided, see "item7management's discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operationsreinsurance recoverables."
the
availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity. the availability of reinsurance capacity can be
impacted by general economic conditions and conditions in the reinsurance market, such as the occurrence of significant reinsured events. the availability and cost of reinsurance could affect our
business volume and profitability.
because
of the risks set forth above, we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at
commercially reasonable rates or at all, and/or life insurance companies may fail to make required annuity payments, and thus our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we are exposed to credit risk in certain of our business operations.in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our investment
portfolio and
reinsurance recoverables (discussed above), we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business operations, including credit risk relating to policyholders, independent agents and
brokers.
we
are exposed to credit risk in our surety insurance operations, where we guarantee to a third party that our customer will satisfy certain performance obligations (e.g.,a
construction contract) or certain financial obligations. if a customer of ours defaults, we may suffer losses and not be reimbursed by that customer. in addition, it is customary practice in the
surety business for multiple insurers to participate as co-sureties on large surety bonds. under these arrangements, the
co-surety obligations are typically joint and several, in which case we are also exposed to credit risk with respect to our co-sureties.
in
addition, a portion of our business is written with large deductible insurance policies. under workers' compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, we are obligated to
pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. we are subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount, and, as a result, we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder.
moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers' compensation policies (i.e.,policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss
experience of the policyholder during the policy period). retrospectively rated policies expose us to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original
premium.
our
efforts to mitigate the credit risk that we have to our insureds may not be successful. to reduce such credit risk, we require certain insureds to post collateral for some or all of
these obligations, often in the form of pledged securities such as money market funds or letters of credit provided by banks. in cases where we receive pledged securities and the insureds are unable
to honor their obligations, we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged and/or the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed during an insured's bankruptcy. in cases where
we receive letters of credit from banks and the insureds are unable to honor their obligations, we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit.
table of contents
in
accordance with industry practice, when policyholders purchase insurance policies from us through independent agents and brokers, the premiums relating to those policies are often
paid to the agents and brokers for payment to us. in most jurisdictions, the premiums will be deemed to have been paid to us whether or not they are actually received by us. consequently, we assume a
degree of credit risk associated with amounts due from independent agents and brokers.
to
a large degree, the credit risk we face is a function of the economy; accordingly, we face a greater risk in an economic downturn. while we attempt to manage the risks discussed above
through underwriting and investment guidelines, collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful. for example, collateral obtained may subsequently have little
or no value. as a result, our exposure to the above credit risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
within the united states, our businesses are heavily regulated by the states in which we conduct
business, including licensing and supervision, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.these regulatory systems are generally
designed to protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their shareholders and other investors. for example, to protect policyholders whose insurance company
becomes financially insolvent, guaranty funds have been established in all 50 states to pay the covered claims of policyholders in the event of an insolvency of an insurer, subject to applicable state
limits. the funding of guaranty funds is provided through assessments levied against remaining insurers in the marketplace. as a result, the insolvency of one or more insurance companies could result
in additional assessments levied against us.
these
regulatory systems also address authorization for lines of business, policyholders' surplus requirements, limitations on the types and amounts of certain investments, underwriting
limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurer's business.
in
recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. further, the naic and state insurance regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing
on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. in a time of financial uncertainty or a prolonged economic downturn
or otherwise, regulators may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations. for example, insurance regulators may choose to restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make
payments to their parent companies or reject rate increases due to the economic environment. the state insurance regulators may also increase the statutory capital requirements for our insurance
subsidiaries.
in
addition, state tax laws that specifically impact the insurance industry, such as premium taxes or other taxes, may be enacted or changed by states to raise revenues.
state
laws or regulations that are adopted or amended may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus
could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.
changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on us and otherwise adversely impact our results.while the u.s. federal
government
has not historically regulated the insurance business, in 2010 the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act) established a federal
insurance office within the u.s. department of the treasury. the federal insurance office has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather data and information regarding the insurance
industry and insurers, including conducting a study for submission to the u.s. congress on how to modernize and improve insurance regulation in the u.s. further, the dodd-frank act gives
the federal reserve supervisory authority over a number of nonbank financial services
table of contents
holding
companies, including insurance companies, if they are designated by a two-thirds vote of a financial stability oversight council (the council) as "systemically important financial
institutions" (sifi). based on rules and interpretive guidance adopted by the council, we do not expect that we will be designated as a sifi. nonetheless, it is possible that the council may change
its rules or interpretations in the future and conclude that we are a sifi. if we were designated as "systemically important," the federal reserve's supervisory authority could include the ability to
impose heightened financial regulation and could impact requirements regarding our capital, liquidity and leverage as well as our business and investment conduct. as a result of the foregoing, the
dodd-frank act, or other additional federal regulation that is adopted in the future, could impose significant burdens on us, including impacting the ways in which we conduct our business,
increasing compliance costs and duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive disadvantage, particularly relative to other insurers that may not be subject to the same level of
regulation.
even
if we are not subject to additional regulation by the federal government, significant financial sector regulatory reform, including the dodd-frank act, could have a
significant impact on us. for example, regulatory reform could have an unexpected impact on our rights as a creditor or on our competitive position. in particular, the dodd-frank act
authorizes assessments to pay for the resolution of systemically important financial institutions that have become insolvent. we (as a financial company with more than $50billion in assets)
could be assessed, and, although any such assessment is required to be risk weighted (i.e.,riskier firms pay more), such costs could be material to us and are not currently estimable.
other
potential changes in u.s. federal legislation, regulation and/or administrative policies, including the potential repeal of the mccarran-ferguson act (which exempts insurance from
most federal regulation) and potential changes in federal taxation, could also significantly harm the insurance industry, including us.
a downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase
our
borrowing costs.claims-paying and financial strength ratings are important to an insurer's competitive position. rating agencies periodically review insurers'
ratings and change their ratings criteria; therefore, our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. a downgrade in one or more of our ratings could negatively impact our business volumes
because demand for certain of our products may be reduced, particularly because many customers may require that we maintain minimum ratings to enter into or renew business with us. additionally, we
may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs. if significant losses, including, but not limited to, those resulting from one or more major
catastrophes, or significant reserve additions or significant investment losses were to cause our capital position to deteriorate significantly, or if one or more rating agencies substantially
increase their capital requirements, we may need to raise equity capital in the future
(which we may not be able to do at a reasonable cost or at all, especially at a time of financial market disruption) in order to maintain our ratings or limit the extent of a downgrade. a continued
trend of more frequent and severe weather-related catastrophes or a prolonged financial market disruption or economic downturn may lead rating agencies to substantially increase their capital
requirements. see also "during or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected." for further discussion about our
ratings, see, "item1businessratings."
the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations, pay future shareholder
dividends
or make future share repurchases.our holding company relies on dividends from our insurance subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and
principal on outstanding debt, to pay dividends to shareholders, to make contributions to our qualified domestic pension plan, to pay other corporate expenses and to make share repurchases. the
ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to
table of contents
our
holding company in the future will depend on their statutory surplus, earnings and regulatory restrictions.
we
are subject to regulation by some states as an insurance holding company system. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum
amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. in a time of prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, regulators may choose to
further restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies. the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company is also restricted
by regulations that set standards of solvency that must be met and maintained.
the
inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in an amount sufficient to meet our debt service obligations and other cash requirements could harm
our ability to meet our obligations, to pay future shareholder dividends and to make share repurchases.
disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us.we market our insurance products
primarily
through independent agents and brokers. an important part of our business is written through less than a dozen such intermediaries. further, there has been a trend of increased consolidation by agents
and brokers, which could impact our relationships with and fees
paid to some agents and brokers. loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided through such agents and brokers could materially and adversely affect our future business volume and
results of operations.
we
may also seek to develop new product distribution channels, including our current efforts to establish a direct-to-consumer platform in the personal insurance
segment. in addition, agents and brokers may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business, such as insurance exchanges, that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.
our efforts or their efforts with respect to alternate distribution channels could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products,
resulting in a lower volume of business generated from these sources.
we
rely on internet applications for the marketing and sale of certain of our products, and we may increasingly rely on internet applications and toll-free numbers for
distribution. in some instances, our agents and brokers are required to access separate business platforms to execute the sale of our personal insurance or commercial insurance products. should
internet disruptions occur, or frustration with our business platforms or distribution initiatives develop among our independent agents and brokers, any resulting loss of business could materially and
adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations. see "if we experience difficulties with technology, data security and/or outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our
business could be negatively impacted" below.
our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets may not be successful and may create enhanced risks.a number of our
recent and
planned business initiatives involve developing new products or expanding existing products in targeted markets. this includes the following efforts, from time to time, to protect or grow market
share:
we may develop products that insure risks we have not previously insured or contain new coverage or coverage terms.
we may refine our underwriting processes. for example, in certain of our businesses in recent years, we have substantially
increased the volume of business that flows through our automated underwriting and pricing systems.
we may seek to expand distribution channels, such as our efforts to develop a direct-to-consumer platform in personal
insurance.
table of contents
we may focus on geographic markets within or outside of the united states where we have had relatively little or no market
share.
we
may not be successful in introducing new products or expanding in targeted markets and, even if we are successful, these efforts may create enhanced risks. among other
risks:
demand for new products or in new markets may not meet our expectations.
to the extent we are able to market new products or expand in new markets, our risk exposures may change, and the data and
models we use to manage such exposures may not be as sophisticated as those we use in existing markets or with existing products. this, in turn, could lead to losses in excess of our expectations.
models underlying automated underwriting and pricing decisions may not be effective.
efforts to develop new products or markets have the potential to create or increase distribution channel conflict, such as
described above under "disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us."
in connection with the conversion of existing policyholders to a new product, some policyholders' pricing may increase,
while the pricing for other policyholders may decrease, the net impact of which could negatively impact retention and margins.
to develop new products or markets, we may need to make substantial capital and operating expenditures, which may also
negatively impact results in the near term.
if
our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets are not successful, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
changes in u.s. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact us.tax laws may change
in ways that
adversely impact us. for example, federal tax legislation could be enacted to reduce the existing statutory u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35%, which would, accordingly, reduce any u.s.
deferred tax asset. the amount of any net deferred tax asset is volatile and significantly impacted by changes in unrealized investment gains and losses. the effect of a reduction in a tax rate on net
deferred tax assets is required to be recognized, in full, as a reduction of income from continuing operations in the period when enacted and, along with other changes in the tax rules that may
increase the company's actual tax expense, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
our
investment portfolio has benefited from tax exemptions and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such
as foreign tax credits). federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted in connection with deficit reduction or various types of fundamental tax reform that would lessen or eliminate some or
all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us and therefore could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, such legislation could adversely affect the value of our
investment portfolio, particularly changes to the taxation of interest from municipal bonds (which comprise 52% of our investment portfolio as of december31, 2012) could materially and
adversely impact the value of those bonds.
other
tax law changes could adversely impact us. the size of the federal deficit, as well as the budget constraints faced by many states and localities, increases the likelihood that
congress and state and local governments will raise revenue by enacting legislation increasing the taxes paid by individuals and corporations.
we may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.the
profitability of our
property and casualty business substantially depends on the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use
table of contents
in
pricing our policies. we utilize third-party and proprietary models to help us price business in a manner that is intended to be consistent, over time, with actual results and return objectives. we
incorporate the company's historical loss experience, external industry data and economic indices into our modeling processes, and we use various methods, including predictive modeling, forecasting
and sophisticated simulation modeling techniques, to analyze loss trends and the risks associated with our assets and liabilities. we also use these modeling processes, analyses and methods in making
underwriting, pricing and reinsurance decisions as part of managing our exposure to catastrophes and other extreme adverse events. these modeling processes incorporate numerous assumptions and
forecasts about the future level and variability of: interest rates, inflation, capital requirements, and frequency and severity of losses, among others, that are difficult to make and may differ
materially from actual results.
whether
we use a proprietary or third-party model, future experience may be materially different from past and current experience incorporated in a model's forecasts or simulations. this
includes the likelihood of events occurring or continuing or the correlation among events. third party models may provide substantially different indications than what our proprietary modeling
processes provide. as a result, third-party model estimates of losses can be, and often have been, materially different for similar events in comparison to our proprietary estimates. the differences
between third-party model estimates and our proprietary estimates are driven by the use of different data sets as well as different assumptions and forecasts regarding the frequency and severity of
events and claims arising from the events.
if
we fail to appropriately price the risks we insure, or fail to change our pricing model to appropriately reflect our current experience, or if our claims experience is more frequent
or severe than our underlying risk assumptions, our profit margins may be negatively affected. if we underestimate the frequency and/or severity of extreme adverse events occurring, our financial
condition may be adversely affected. if we overestimate the risks we are exposed to, we may overprice our products, and new business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely
affected. as we expand into different markets and geographies, we will write more policies in markets and geographical areas where we have less data specific to these new markets and geographies, and,
accordingly, we may be more susceptible to error in our models and strategy. see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationscatastrophe modeling."
our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in
technology.we depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business and processing claims, as well as for providing the data and analytics we
utilize to manage our business, and thus our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems
that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner. some system development projects are long-term in nature, may negatively impact our
expense ratios as we invest in the projects and may cost more than we expect to complete. in addition, system development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are complete, or may
be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in accelerated recognition of expenses. if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology
portfolio, or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect, our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement our
strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted.
if we experience difficulties with technology, data security and/or outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively
impacted.while technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives present significant risks.
our business is highly dependent upon our employees' ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions. a shut-down of, or inability to access,
one or more
table of contents
of
our facilities (including our primary data processing facility); a power outage; or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly
impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis, particularly if such an interruption lasts for an extended period of time. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe,
terrorist attack or industrial accident, or due to a computer virus, our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time. in addition, because our information technology and
telecommunications systems increasingly interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a
third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if our business continuity plans did not sufficiently address such a business interruption, system failure or service denial, this could result
in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions.
our
operations rely on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. computer viruses, hackers,
employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches,
cyber-attacks or other disruptions. in addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by e-mail and other electronic means. while we attempt
to develop secure transmission capabilities with third-party vendors and others with whom we do business, we may be unable to put in place secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third
parties and, in addition, these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information.
our
computer systems have been and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related
penetrations. while, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a material breach of cyber security, administrative and technical controls as well as other preventative actions we take to
reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer
systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. in addition, new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risks of
cyber-attacks. we may forego the implementation of such new technology to limit this additional risk.
these
increased risks, and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security, could expose us to data loss, disruption of service, monetary and reputational damages and
significant increases in compliance costs and costs to improve the security and resiliency of our computer systems. as a result, our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected.
we
have increasingly outsourced certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may continue to do so in the future. if we do not effectively develop, implement
and monitor our outsourcing relationships, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize expected
productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business. our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions
to third parties may expose us to increased risk related to data security or service disruptions, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. in addition, our ability to receive services
from third party providers outside of the united states might be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies inside or outside of the
united states. as a result, our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected.
table of contents
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our business outside the united states.we conduct business outside the united
states primarily
in the united kingdom, canada and the republic of ireland. in addition, we have a joint venture in brazil and may also explore opportunities in other countries, including latin american countries and
other emerging markets such as india and china.
while
our business outside of the united states currently constitutes a relatively small portion of our revenues, in conducting such business we are subject to a number of significant
risks, particularly in emerging economies. these risks include restrictions such as price controls, capital controls, currency exchange limits, ownership limits and other restrictive or
anti-competitive governmental actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation. our investments outside the united states may also subject us to currency risk
and, in some markets, it may be difficult to effectively hedge that risk. in addition, in some markets, we may invest as part of a joint venture with a local counterparty. because our governance
rights may be limited, we may not have control over the ability of the joint venture to make certain decisions and/or mitigate risks it faces, and significant disagreements with a joint venture
counterparty may adversely impact our investment. investments outside the united states also subject us to additional domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the foreign corrupt practices
act and similar laws in other countries that prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials. although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with
these laws, if those controls are ineffective and an employee or intermediary fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties and our business and
our reputation could be adversely affected. some countries, particularly
emerging economies, have laws and regulations that lack clarity and, even with local expertise and effective controls, it can be difficult to determine the exact requirements of, and potential
liability under, the local laws. for example, in some jurisdictions, including brazil, parties to a joint venture may, in some circumstances, have liability for some obligations of the venture and
that liability may extend beyond the capital invested. failure to comply with local laws in a particular market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and negative effect not
only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally.
new regulations outside of the u.s., including in the european union, could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our
growth.insurance laws or regulations that are adopted or amended in jurisdictions outside the u.s. may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and
may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.
in
particular, the european union's executive body, the european commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called solvency ii that would apply to
our businesses in the european union beginning as soon as january1, 2014; however, the effective implementation date may be delayed. under solvency ii, it is possible that the direct or
indirect parent of a european union subsidiary (including a u.s. parent company) could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary's capital position
is dependent on an affiliated or parent company and the affiliated or parent company is not already subject to regulations deemed "equivalent" to solvency ii. in addition, regulators in countries
where we have operations are working with the international association of insurance supervisors (iais) (and in the u.s., with the naic) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including
group supervision.
the
iais is working with the financial stability board (fsb) created by the g-20 and is developing a methodology for determining whether and which, if any, insurance
companies pose a systemic risk to the global economy. such insurers would be designated "global systemically important insurers" (g-siis) and would likely be subject to higher capital
requirements, enhanced supervision or both. the iais has released for comment proposed methodology for identifying potential g-siis but has not yet decided upon the criteria for, or the
consequences of, such designation. upon finalizing the
table of contents
assessment
methodology and determining the consequences of a g-sii designation, the fsb along with national authorities expect to publish the list of g-siis in april 2013.
while
it is not yet known how these actions will impact us, such regulation could result in increased costs of compliance, increased disclosure and less flexibility in our capital
management.
acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences.from time to
time we may
investigate and pursue acquisition opportunities if we believe that such opportunities are consistent with our long-term objectives and that the potential rewards of an acquisition justify
the risks. the process of integrating an acquired company or business can be complex and costly, however, and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. for example, acquisitions
may present significant risks, including:
the potential disruption of our ongoing business;
the ineffective integration of underwriting, claims handling and actuarial practices;
the uncertainty of an acquiree's reserve estimates;
the diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges;
the loss of key employees;
the cultural challenges associated with integrating employees; and
the impact of an acquisition on our financial position and/or credit ratings.
the
acquired business may not perform as projected, and any cost savings and other synergies anticipated from the acquisition may not materialize. there is no guarantee that any
businesses acquired in the future will be successfully integrated, and the ineffective integration of our businesses and processes may result in substantial costs or delays and adversely affect our
ability to compete.
changes to existing accounting standards may adversely impact our reported results.as a u.s.-based sec reporting company, we are
currently required
to prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board (fasb). during the last several
years, the securities and exchange commission (sec) has been evaluating whether, when and how international financial reporting standards (ifrs) should be incorporated into the u.s. financial
reporting system, including for companies such as us. the fasb and the international accounting standards board (iasb) have also embarked on a long-term project to converge gaap and ifrs.
additionally, the iasb and the fasb are in the process of developing a global insurance standard that may involve methodologies for valuing insurance contract liabilities that may be significantly
different from the methodologies required by current gaap. in june 2012, the fasb issued a statement that indicated that based on the nature and totality of differences between the fasb's and iasb's
views, it is not likely that the two boards will achieve convergence on this project. the fasb further noted that the fasb and iasb have very different perspectives on the project, given that the u.s.
has existing guidance on insurance contracts whereas there is currently no comprehensive ifrs insurance standard for insurance contracts. as a result of this, it is currently unclear what changes, if
any, may be made to the accounting for insurance contracts under gaap as a result of this project, and we are not able to predict whether we will choose to, or be required to, adopt ifrs or how the
adoption of ifrs (or the convergence of gaap and ifrs, including the project for valuing insurance contract liabilities) may impact our financial statements in the future. changes in accounting
standards, particularly those that specifically apply to insurance company operations, may impact the content and presentation of our reported financial results and could have adverse consequences to
our reported financial results, including lower reported results of operations and shareholders' equity and increased volatility and decreased comparability of our reported results with other
insurers.
table of contents
we could be adversely affected if our controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not
effective.our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claim processing and investment
activities, many of which are highly complex. these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards. a control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. if our controls are not effective, it could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk
exposure (including underwriting, credit and investment risk) or damage to our reputation.
in
addition, ineffective controls could lead to litigation or regulatory action. the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings
against various types of financial institutions have increased in recent years following the recent economic downturn and market disruption. substantial legal liability or significant regulatory
action against us could have a material adverse financial impact. see note16 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are
involved.
our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.there is significant competition from
within the
property and casualty insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those possessing highly specialized underwriting
knowledge. our performance is largely dependent on the talents, efforts and proper conduct of highly-skilled individuals, including our senior executives, many of whom have decades of experience in
the insurance industry. see "item10directors, executive officers and corporate governance" for more information relating to our executive officers. our continued ability to
compete effectively in our businesses and to expand into new business areas depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. if we are not able to
successfully attract, retain and motivate our employees, our business, financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.
loss of or significant restriction on the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of personal insurance products could reduce our future
profitability.in personal insurance, we use credit scoring as a factor in pricing decisions where allowed by state law. some consumer groups and regulators have
questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against people with low incomes, minority groups and the elderly and are calling for the prohibition or restriction on the use of
credit scoring in underwriting and pricing. laws or regulations that significantly curtail the use of credit scoring, if enacted in a large number of states, could adversely affect our future
profitability.

the
company's board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to
pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of rule10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. the authorizations do not
have a stated expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the company's financial position, earnings, common
share price, catastrophe losses, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other
investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions), market conditions and other factors.
the

following discussions of the company's net income and segment operating income (loss) are presented on an after-tax basis. discussions of the components of net income and
segment operating income are presented on a pretax basis, unless otherwise noted. discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis.
overview
diluted net income per share in 2012 was $6.30, an increase of 88% over diluted net income per share of $3.36 in 2011. net income in
2012 was $2.47billion, an increase of 73% over net income of $1.43billion in 2011. the higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of common share
repurchases. the improvement in net income in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily reflected the pretax impact of (i)higher underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year
reserve development ("underlying underwriting margins") primarily resulting from lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the business insurance and personal insurance segments and
the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in the business insurance and financial, professional& international insurance segments, (ii)a decline in catastrophe losses
and (iii)higher net favorable prior year reserve development. partially offsetting these pretax improvements were their

tax expense. the effective tax rate in 2012 increased from the prior year due to interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of
35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income. net income in 2011 benefited from a reduction in income tax expense of $104million resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior
year tax matters. catastrophe losses in 2012 were $1.86billion, compared with $2.56billion in 2011. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012 was $940million,
compared with $715million in 2011.
diluted
net income per share in 2011 was $3.36, a decrease of 49% from diluted net income per share of $6.62 in 2010. net income in 2011 was $1.43billion, a decrease of 56% from
net income of $3.22billion in 2010. the lower rate of decline in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of common share repurchases. the decline in net income in 2011 compared with
2010 primarily reflected the pretax impact of (i)a significant increase in catastrophe losses, (ii)lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (iii)lower underlying
underwriting margins related to earned pricing and loss cost trends and higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (iv)lower net investment income and (v)lower net
realized investment gains. partially offsetting these pretax declines were their related tax benefit. the effective tax rate in 2011 decreased from the prior year due to interest on municipal bonds,
which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a higher percentage of pretax income. these factors were partially offset by a $104million
benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 were $2.56billion and $1.11billion, respectively. net favorable
prior year reserve development in 2011 and 2010 was $715million and $1.25billion, respectively.

net
investment income in 2012 was $2.89 billion, $10 million or less than 1% higher than in 2011. net investment income from fixed maturity investments was $2.44 billion in 2012, a
decrease of $104 million from 2011, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market. net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments was $476
million in 2012, an increase of $121 million over 2011, primarily driven by improved results from the company's real estate partnerships and hedge fund investments. on an after-tax basis, net
investment income in 2012 was $14million or less than 1% lower than in 2011, reflecting a higher proportion of taxable net investment income in 2012 compared with 2011.
net
investment income in 2011 was $2.88 billion, $180 million or 6% lower than in 2010. net investment income from fixed maturity investments was $2.54 billion in 2011, a decrease of
$167 million from 2010, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market, as well as lower average levels of fixed maturity invested assets due to the company's
common share repurchases. net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments was $355 million in 2011, a decrease of $15 million from 2010.
fee income
the national accounts market in the business insurance segment is the primary source of the company's fee-based business. the $27
million and $9 million increases in fee income in 2012 and 2011, respectively, compared with the respective prior years are described in the business insurance segment discussion that follows.

other net realized investment gainsother net realized investment gains in 2012 of $66 million were primarily driven by $61 million of net realized
investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $19 million of net realized investment gains related to real estate and $8 million of net realized investment gains related to equity
securities. these net realized investment gains were partially offset by $14 million of net realized investment losses associated with u.s. treasury futures contracts (which require daily
mark-to-market settlement and are used to shorten the duration of the company's fixed maturity portfolio) and $8 million of net realized investment losses related to other
investments.
other
net realized investment gains in 2011 of $80 million were primarily driven by $52 million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $46 million of net
realized investment gains related to equity securities and $41 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments, partially offset by net realized investment losses of $62 million
associated with u.s. treasury futures contracts.
other
net realized investment gains in 2010 of $290 million were primarily driven by a $205 million gain resulting from the company's sale of substantially all of its remaining common
stock holdings in verisk analytics,inc. (verisk) for total proceeds of approximately $230 million as part of a secondary public offering of verisk. the 2010 total also included $96 million of

related
to fixed maturity investments and $25 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities. these gains were partially offset by $30 million of net realized investment losses
related to u.s. treasury futures contracts.
other revenues
other revenues primarily consist of premium installment charges. in 2010, this category also included $60 million of expenses related
to the company's purchase and retirement of $885 million of its $1.0 billion 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2012 were $14.68 billion, $1.60 billion or 10% lower than in 2011. the decrease primarily
reflected (i)a decline in catastrophe losses and, to a lesser extent, (ii)lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (iii)higher net favorable prior
year reserve development, partially offset by (iv)the impact of loss cost trends. catastrophe losses in 2012 and 2011 were $1.86 billion and $2.56 billion, respectively. catastrophe losses in
2012 primarily resulted from storm sandy, as well as multiple tornado, wind and hail storms in several regions of the united states. catastrophe losses in 2011 primarily resulted from hurricane irene
and tropical storm lee, multiple tornadoes and hail storms in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states and severe winter storms throughout the united states. catastrophe losses in 2011
also included losses from floods in thailand and an earthquake in japan that impacted the financial, professional& international insurance segment. net favorable prior year reserve development
in 2012 and 2011 was $940 million and $715 million, respectively. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development in each segment during these periods are discussed in more detail
in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2011 were $16.28 billion, $3.07 billion or 23% higher than in 2010. the increase primarily reflected (i)the significant increase in
catastrophe losses, (ii)the decrease in net favorable prior year reserve development, (iii)the impact of loss cost trends and (iv)higher non-catastrophe
weather-related losses. catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 were $2.56 billion and $1.11 billion, respectively. catastrophe losses in 2010 primarily resulted from several severe wind and hail storms,
as well as severe winter storms. in addition, catastrophe losses in 2010 included losses from an earthquake in chile that impacted the financial, professional& international insurance segment.
net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 and 2010 was $715 million and $1.25
billion, respectively. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development in each segment are discussed in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
amortization of deferred acquisition costs
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2012 was $3.91 billion, $34 million or 1% higher than in 2011. the amortization of
deferred acquisition costs in 2011 was $3.88 billion, $74 million or 2% higher than in 2010. changes in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in both 2012 and 2011 were generally consistent
with the increase in earned premiums compared with the respective prior year.
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses in 2012 were $3.61 billion, $54 million or 2% higher than in 2011. general and administrative
expenses in 2011 were $3.56 billion, $150 million or 4% higher than in 2010. general and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.
table of contents
interest expense
interest expense in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $378 million, $386 million and $388 million, respectively. the decline in 2012 compared
with 2011 reflected the repayment of $258 million of debt in the second quarter of 2012.
income tax expense (benefit)
the company's consolidated income tax expense in 2012 was $693 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $74 million in 2011. the
increase in income tax expense of $767 million in 2012 from 2011 primarily reflected the $1.77 billion improvement in underwriting margins in 2012 (including the favorable impacts of a decrease in
catastrophe losses and an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development) over 2011 and, to a lesser extent, the $121 million increase in net investment income from non-fixed
maturity investments over 2011. the change in income tax expense (benefit) in 2012 from 2011 was also impacted by the $104 million benefit recorded in 2011 resulting from the favorable resolution of
various prior year tax matters.
the
company's consolidated income tax benefit in 2011 was $74 million, compared to an income tax expense of $1.09 billion in 2010. the decrease in income tax expense of $1.16 billion in
2011 from 2010 primarily reflected the $2.59 billion decrease in underwriting margins in 2011 (including the unfavorable impacts of an increase in catastrophe losses and a decrease in net favorable
prior year reserve development) from 2010 and, to a lesser extent, the decrease in net realized investment gains of $209 million from 2010. the change in income tax expense (benefit) in 2011 from 2010
was also impacted by the $104 million benefit recorded in 2011 resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters.
the
company's effective tax rate was 22%, (5%) and 25% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the company's effective tax rates in 2012 and 2010 were lower than the statutory rate of 35%
primarily due to the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the company's income tax provision. in addition to the impact of tax-exempt income, the
company's effective tax rate of (5%) in 2011 also reflected the impact of the company's significant underwriting loss that primarily resulted from catastrophe losses and the $104 million benefit
resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters recorded in the first quarter of 2011.
gaap combined ratios
the consolidated gaap combined ratio of 97.1% in 2012 was 8.0 points lower than the consolidated gaap combined ratio of 105.1% in 2011.
the
consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 64.9% in 2012 was 8.0 points lower than the consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 72.9% in 2011. catastrophe

overview
operating income in 2012 was $1.84billion, $489million or 36% higher than operating income of $1.35billion in
2011. the improvement in operating income in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily reflected the pretax impact of (i)higher underlying underwriting margins primarily resulting from earned pricing
that exceeded loss cost trends, lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and higher business volume, (ii)a decline in catastrophe losses, (iii)an increase in net
favorable prior year reserve development and (iv)an increase in net investment income. partially offsetting these pretax improvements were their related tax expense. the effective tax rate in
2012 increased from the prior year due to interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax
income. operating income in 2011 included a $76million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. catastrophe losses in 2012 were $794million,
compared with $1.02billion in 2011. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012 was $467million, compared with $245million in 2011.
operating
income in 2011 was $1.35billion, $947million or 41% lower than in 2010. the decline in operating income in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily reflected the
pretax impact of (i)lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii)a significant increase in catastrophe losses, (iii)lower underlying underwriting margins related to
earned pricing and loss cost trends, partially offset by higher business volume, and (iv)lower net investment income. partially offsetting these net pretax declines were their related net tax
benefit. the effective tax rate in 2011 decreased from the prior year due to interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%,
comprising a higher percentage of pretax income. these factors were partially offset by the $76million benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. net
favorable prior year reserve development was $245million in 2011, compared with $901million in 2010. catastrophe losses in 2011 were $1.02billion, compared with
$437million in 2010.
revenues
earned premiums

million or 5% higher than in 2010. the increases in both years primarily reflected the impact of increases in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months. earned premiums in 2012 and 2011
also benefited from positive audit premium adjustments related to increased insured exposures for existing policyholders, compared with negative audit premium adjustments in 2010 related to decreased
insured exposures for existing policyholders.
net investment income
net investment income in 2012 was $2.09 billion, $49 million or 2% higher than in 2011, primarily due to higher net investment income
generated by non-fixed maturity investments, partially offset by lower net investment income from fixed maturity investments. net investment income in 2011 was $2.04 billion, $115 million
or 5% lower than in 2010, primarily due to lower net investment income generated by fixed maturity investments. refer to the "net investment income" section of the "consolidated results of operations"
discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the changes in the company's consolidated net
investment income in 2012 and 2011 compared with the respective prior years. in addition, refer to note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements herein for a discussion of
the company's net investment income allocation methodology.

market
pools. fee income in 2012 increased by $27 million or 9% over 2011. fee income in 2011 increased by $10 million or 4% over 2010. the increases in both years primarily reflected higher serviced
premium volume in workers' compensation residual market pools.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2012 were $7.86 billion, $590 million or 7% lower than in 2011, primarily reflecting
(i)a decline in catastrophe losses, (ii)lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (iii)an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development, partially
offset by (iv)the impact of loss cost trends. catastrophe losses in 2012 were $794 million, compared with $1.02 billion in 2011. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012 was $467
million, compared with $245 million in 2011. factors contributing to net favorable
prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2011 were $8.45 billion, $1.94 billion or 30% higher than in 2010. the increase in 2011 primarily reflected (i)a significant decline in
net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii)a significant increase in catastrophe losses and (iii)the impact of loss cost trends that included slightly higher than expected loss
costs in the workers' compensation and commercial auto product lines. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2011 was $245 million, compared with $901 million in 2010. factors contributing to
net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements. catastrophe losses in 2011 were $1.02 billion,
compared with $437 million in 2010.
amortization of deferred acquisition expenses
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2012 was $1.88billion, $69million or 4% higher than in 2011. the
amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2011 was $1.82billion, $66million or 4% higher than in 2010. the increases in both 2012 and 2011 were generally consistent with the
increases in earned premiums compared to the respective prior year.
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses in 2012 were $2.02billion, $76million or 4% higher than in 2011. the increase in
2012 included the impact of higher employee-related costs. general and administrative expenses in 2011 were $1.94billion, $40million or 2% higher than in 2010, primarily driven by a
higher level of state assessment expenses related to workers' compensation business in new york, which more than offset an overall reduction in operating expenses that was driven by lower
employee-related costs.

income tax expense
income tax expense in 2012 was $539million, compared to $134million in 2011. the increase in income tax expense of
$405million in 2012 from 2011 primarily reflected the $836million improvement in underwriting margins (including the favorable impacts of a decrease in catastrophes and an increase in
net favorable prior year reserve development) over 2011 and, to a lesser degree, an increase in net investment income from non-fixed maturity investments over 2011. the change in income
tax expense in 2012 from 2011 was also impacted by the $76million benefit in 2011 resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters.
income
tax expense in 2011 was $134million, compared to $777million in 2010. the decrease in income tax expense of $643million in 2011 from 2010 primarily

overview
operating income in 2012 was $642million, $5million or 1% lower than operating income in 2011. the decline in operating
income in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily reflected the pretax declines in net favorable prior year reserve development and net investment income, largely offset by higher underlying underwriting
margins resulting from the pretax impact of (i)lower levels of what the company defines as large losses and (ii)earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by
(iii)the impact of lower business volumes. the effective tax rate in 2012 increased slightly from the prior year, reflecting the impact of a $14million benefit in 2011 resulting from
the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012 was $298million, compared with $360million in 2011. catastrophe losses
in 2012 were $50million, compared with $55million in 2011.
operating
income in 2011 was $647million, $27million or 4% higher than operating income in 2010. the improvement in operating income in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily
reflected a pretax increase in underwriting margins, partially offset by a pretax decline in net investment income. the increase in underwriting margins was driven by the pretax impact of
(i)higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii)declines in catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses, partially offset by the impact of
(i)lower business volume, (ii)higher general and administrative expenses and (iii)a higher level of large losses. the effective tax rate in 2011 decreased slightly from the
prior year, reflecting the impact of a $14million benefit in 2011 resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. net favorable prior year reserve development in
2011 was $360million, compared with $259million in 2010. catastrophe losses in 2011 were $55million, compared with $82million in 2010.
revenues
earned premiums
earned premiums in 2012 were $3.05billion, $129million or 4% lower than in 2011, primarily reflecting the impact of
lower construction surety premium volumes over the preceding twelve months, intentional underwriting actions undertaken in the company's operations at lloyd's intended to improve risk and reward
(particularly in the catastrophe-exposed lines of business), the impact of the termination of an exclusive broker relationship in the republic of ireland, the company's withdrawal from personal
insurance business in the republic of ireland, competitive market conditions and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency rates of exchange.
table of contents
earned premiums in 2011 were $3.17billion, $143million or 4% lower than in 2010. the decline primarily reflected the impact of the termination of
an exclusive broker relationship in the republic of ireland, lower construction surety premium volumes over the preceding twelve months, intentional underwriting actions undertaken in the company's
operations at lloyd's intended to improve risk and reward (particularly in the catastrophe-exposed lines of business) and competitive market conditions. earned premiums in 2011 benefited slightly from
the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. in addition, earned premiums in 2010 benefited from the impact of a reduction in surety reinsurance costs associated with prior year
reinsurance treaties.
net investment income
net investment income in 2012 was $395million, $19million or 5% lower than in 2011, primarily due to lower net
investment income from fixed maturity investments, partially offset by higher net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments. net investment income in 2011 was
$414million, $25million or 6% lower than in 2010. included in the financial, professional& international insurance segment are certain legal entities whose invested assets and
related net investment income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. as a result, reported net investment income in the financial,
professional& international insurance segment reflects a significantly smaller proportion of allocated net investment
income, including that from the company's non-fixed maturity investments that experienced an increase in investment income in 2012 and 2011. refer to the "net investment income" section of
the "consolidated results of operations" discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the changes in the company's consolidated net investment income in 2012 and 2011 compared
with the respective prior years. in addition, refer to note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements herein for a discussion of the company's net investment income
allocation methodology.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2012 were $1.31billion, $173million or 12% lower than in 2011, primarily
reflecting (i)lower levels of large losses and (ii)the impact of lower construction surety premium volumes and intentional underwriting actions as discussed above, partially offset by
(iii)a decline in net favorable prior year reserve development. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012 was $298million, compared with $360million in 2011. both
bond& financial products and international contributed to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are
discussed in more detail in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements. catastrophe losses in 2012 were $50million, compared with $55million in 2011.
claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2011 were $1.49billion, $213million or 13% lower than in 2010, primarily reflecting (i)an increase in net favorable prior
year reserve development, (ii)a decline in catastrophe losses, (iii)lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (iv)lower business volume, partially offset by
a higher level of large losses. net favorable prior year reserve development was $360million and $259million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. factors contributing to net favorable prior
year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements. catastrophe losses in 2011 were $55million, compared with
$82 million in 2010.
amortization of deferred acquisition costs
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2012 was $589 million, $14 million or 2% lower than in 2011. the amortization of
deferred acquisition costs was $603 million in 2011, $9 million or 1%
table of contents
lower
than in 2010. the decrease in 2012 was generally consistent with the decrease in earned premiums, whereas the decrease in 2011 was less than the decrease in earned premiums, primarily due to the
increase to earned premiums in 2010 as a result of a reduction in surety reinsurance costs associated with prior year reinsurance treaties.
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses in 2012 were $667 million, $19 million or 3% higher than in 2011. general and administrative
expenses were $648 million in 2011, $40 million or 7% higher than in 2010. the increases in both 2012 and 2011 primarily reflected increases in employee- and technology-related costs to enhance
operations and support future business growth.
income tax expense
income tax expense in 2012 was $255 million, compared to $230 million in 2011. the increase in income tax expense of $25 million in
2012 from 2011 primarily reflected the impact of a $14 million benefit in 2011 from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters and, to a lesser extent, an increase in underwriting
margins in 2012 from 2011.
income
tax expense in 2011 was $230 million, compared with $245 million in 2010. the decrease in income tax of $15 million in 2011 from 2010 primarily reflected the impact of a $14
million benefit in 2011 from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters.
gaap combined ratios
the gaap combined ratio of 84.1% in 2012 was 1.7 points lower than the gaap combined ratio of 85.8% in 2011.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 42.8% in 2012 was 3.6 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 46.4% in 2011. the 2012 and 2011 ratios included 9.8
points and 11.3 points of benefit, respectively, from net favorable prior year reserve development. catastrophe losses in 2012 and 2011 accounted for 1.7 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio in each year. the 2012 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 5.1 points lower than the 2011 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the factors discussed above.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 41.3% in 2012 was 1.9 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 39.4% in 2011, primarily reflecting the impact of a decline in earned
premiums and, to a lesser extent, the impact of an increase in general and administrative expenses.
the
gaap combined ratio of 85.8% in 2011 was 1.9 points lower than the gaap combined ratio of 87.7% in 2010.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 46.4% in 2011 was 4.5 points lower than the 2010 ratio of 50.9%. catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 accounted for 1.7 and 2.4 points of the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development provided 11.3 points and 7.8 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2011
and 2010, respectively. the 2011 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 0.3 points lower than the 2010 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the factors discussed above.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 39.4% in 2011 was 2.6 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 36.8% in 2010. the increase in 2011 primarily reflected lower earned premium
volumes in international and construction surety and the increase in general and administrative expenses discussed above.

net
written premiums in bond& financial products in 2012 were $1.92 billion, $29 million or 1% lower than in 2011. the decrease was primarily driven by lower business volume in
construction surety due to the continued low levels of government construction spending, which was largely offset by growth in management liability business volume. excluding the surety line of
business, for which the following are not relevant measures, business retention rates in 2012 remained strong and were slightly higher than in 2011. renewal premium changes in 2012 were positive and
significantly higher than in 2011, primarily driven by positive renewal rate changes. new business volume in 2012 was slightly lower than in 2011.
net
written premiums in bond& financial products in 2011 were $1.95 billion, $28 million or 1% lower than in 2010, reflecting lower construction surety premium volume due to the
continued slowdown in construction spending, and disciplined underwriting. the decrease also reflected the impact of reductions in surety reinsurance costs in 2010 associated with prior year
reinsurance treaties. excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures, business retention rates in 2011 remained strong and were higher than in 2010. renewal
premium changes in 2011 were slightly positive (compared with slightly negative in 2010), as the modest growth in insured exposures exceeded negative renewal rate changes. new business volume in 2011
increased considerably over 2010.
net
written premiums in international in 2012 were $1.06 billion, $92 million or 8% lower than in 2011. the decrease in 2012 primarily reflected lower business volume in the company's
operations at lloyd's, lower surety volumes in canada, the impact of the company's withdrawal from personal insurance business in the republic of ireland and, to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign
currency rates of exchange. excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures, business retention rates in 2012 were strong and higher than in 2011. renewal
premium changes in 2012 were negative and slightly lower than in 2011, as positive renewal rate changes were more than offset by a decline in insured exposures. new business volumes in 2012 were
slightly lower than in 2011.
net
written premiums in international in 2011 were $1.15 billion, $81 million or 7% lower than in 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of the company's termination of an exclusive

overview
operating income in 2012 was $217million, $549million higher than the operating loss of ($332) million in 2011. the
improvement in operating income in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily reflected the pretax impact of (i)a decline in catastrophe losses, (ii)higher underlying underwriting margins
resulting from lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and lower fire-related losses and (iii)an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development.
partially offsetting these pretax improvements were their related tax expense. the effective tax rate in 2012 increased from the prior year due to interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively
taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income. the operating loss in 2011 included the impact of a $10million benefit
resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters. catastrophe losses in 2012 were $1.02billion, compared with $1.49billion in 2011. net favorable prior year
reserve development in 2012 was $175million, compared with $110million in 2011.
an
operating loss of ($332) million in 2011 compared with operating income of $440million in 2010. the decline in operating income in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily reflected
the pretax impact of (i)a significant increase in catastrophe losses, (ii)lower underlying underwriting margins related to earned pricing and loss cost trends, higher
non-catastrophe weather-related losses and an increase in expenses related to the company's direct to consumer initiative, partially offset by higher
business volumes, and (iii)lower net investment income. partially offsetting these net pretax declines were their related net tax benefit. the effective tax rate in 2011 decreased from the
prior year due to interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a higher percentage of pretax income. these factors
were partially offset by an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development and a $10million benefit resulting from the
table of contents
favorable
resolution of various prior year tax matters. catastrophe losses in 2011 were $1.49billion, compared with $594million in 2010. net favorable prior year reserve development in
2011 was $110million, compared with $87million in 2010.
revenues
earned premiums
earned premiums in 2012 were $7.62 billion, $32 million or less than 1% higher than in 2011. earned premiums of $7.59 billion in 2011
were $240 million or 3% higher than in 2010.
net investment income
net investment income in 2012 was $404 million, $20 million or 5% lower than in 2011, primarily due to lower net investment income from
fixed maturity investments, partially offset by higher net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments. net investment income in 2011 was $424 million, $40 million or 9%
lower than in 2010, primarily due to lower net investment income from fixed maturity investments. refer to the "net investment income" section of "consolidated results of operations" herein for a
discussion of the change in the
company's net investment income in 2012 and 2011 as compared with the respective prior year. in addition, refer to note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements herein for
a discussion of the company's net investment income allocation methodology.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2012 were $5.50 billion, $837 million or 13% lower than in 2011. the decrease primarily
reflected (i)a decline in catastrophe losses and, to a lesser extent, (ii)lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (iii)lower fire-related losses and
(iv)higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (v)the impact of loss cost trends, including a higher number of severe bodily injury claims in the
automobile line of business. catastrophe losses in 2012 were $1.02 billion, compared with $1.49 billion in 2011. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012 was $175 million, compared with
$110 million in 2011. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2011 were $6.34 billion, $1.34 billion or 27% higher than in 2010. the increase primarily reflected (i)the significant increase in
catastrophe losses, (ii)the impact of loss cost trends, (iii)higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (iv)higher business volumes. these factors were
partially offset by an increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. catastrophe losses in 2011 and 2010 were $1.49 billion and $594 million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve
development in 2011 and 2010 was $110 million and $87 million, respectively. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note7 of notes
to the company's consolidated financial statements.
amortization of deferred acquisition costs
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2012 was $1.44 billion, $21 million or 1% lower than in 2011. the amortization of
deferred acquisition costs in 2011 was $1.46 billion, $17 million or 1% higher than in 2010. the changes in deferred acquisition costs in both 2012
and 2011 differed from the change in earned premiums, primarily reflecting an increase in the number of agents reverting to a contingent commission compensation program (the costs of which are
classified in "general and administrative expenses") from a fixed-value compensation program (the costs of which are classified in
table of contents
"amortization
of deferred acquisition costs"), and growth in the company's direct to consumer business (for which no commission expense is incurred).
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses in 2012 were $900 million, $8 million or 1% lower than in 2011. general and administrative expenses
in 2011 were $908 million, $41 million or 5% higher than in 2010. the increase in 2011 was primarily driven by costs associated with the company's direct to consumer initiative, as well as the
increase in contingent commission expense due to the increase in the number of agents reverting to a contingent commission compensation program. the cost of the contingent commission program is not
subject to deferred acquisition cost accounting treatment and, therefore, is expensed as incurred.
income tax expense
income tax expense in 2012 was $32 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $293 million in 2011. the change in income tax expense
of $325 million in 2012 from 2011 primarily reflected the $898 million decrease in underwriting loss (including the favorable impacts of a decrease in catastrophes and an increase in net favorable
prior year reserve development) from 2011. the change in income tax expense in 2012 from 2011 was also impacted by the $10 million benefit in 2011 resulting from the favorable resolution of various
prior year tax matters.
the
income tax benefit in 2011 was $293 million, compared to income tax expense of $134 million in 2010. the change in income tax expense (benefit) of ($427) million in 2011 from 2010
primarily reflected the $1.15 billion decrease in underwriting margins (including the unfavorable impacts of an increase in catastrophes and a decline in net favorable prior year reserve development)
from 2011. the
change in income tax expense (benefit) was also impacted by the $10 million benefit in 2011 resulting from the favorable resolution of various prior year tax matters.
gaap combined ratio
the gaap combined ratio of 101.9% in 2012 was 11.7 points lower than the gaap combined ratio of 113.6% in 2011.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 72.3% in 2012 was 11.2 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 83.5% in 2011. catastrophe losses accounted for 13.4
points and 19.6 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios in 2012 and 2011, respectively. the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for 2012 and 2011 included 2.3 points and 1.5 points of
benefit, respectively, from net favorable prior year reserve development. the 2012 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 4.2 points lower than the 2011 ratio on the same basis,
reflecting the factors discussed above.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 29.6% in 2012 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 30.1% in 2011.
the
gaap combined ratio of 113.6% in 2011 was 15.3 points higher than the gaap combined ratio of 98.3% in 2010.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 83.5% in 2011 was 15.4 points higher than the 2010 ratio of 68.1%. catastrophe losses accounted for 19.6 and 8.1 points of the loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio in 2011 and 2010, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development provided 1.5 points and 1.2 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in
2011 and 2010, respectively. the 2011 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 4.2 points higher than the 2010 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the factors discussed above.

the
operating loss for interest expense and other in 2012 was $18 million lower than in 2011. the operating loss in 2011 was $39 million lower than in 2010, primarily reflecting $39

in 2010 also included a $12 million increase in tax expense associated with recent federal health care legislation and an increase in interest expense. after-tax interest expense in 2012, 2011 and
2010 was $246 million, $251 million and $252 million, respectively.
asbestos claims and litigation
the company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have
expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. the company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims
from the company's policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy). factors underlying these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and
the continued focus by plaintiffs on previously peripheral defendants. the focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy
protection in previous years. in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the
reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the company. the bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased
settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in the tort system. currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present
credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates
delayed or placed on an inactive docket. this trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on previously peripheral defendants, contributes to the claims
and claim adjustment expense payments experienced by the company. the company's asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other
insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers.
the
company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or
a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. in these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated
as a separate occurrence under the policy. it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor
and other company defenses are not successful, the company's coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable
per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. accordingly, although the company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with
these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims.
table of contents
many
coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of
settlement negotiations. settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than
originally anticipated. there also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement, which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the
company. as in the past, the company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.
in
addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to
the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. it is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers,
including the company, could be made in the future. it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers
based on novel legal theories of liability. the company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.
travelers
property casualty corp. (tpc), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, had entered into settlement agreements which are subject to a number of contingencies, in connection
with a number of these direct action claims (direct action settlements). for a full discussion of these settlement agreements, see the "asbestos direct action litigation" section of note16 of
notes to the consolidated financial statements.
because
each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. among the factors
which the company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; limits
and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement
values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process;
and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and
the available coverage, if any, for that claim.
in
the third quarter of 2012, the company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review. as in prior years, the annual claim review considered active policyholders and
litigation cases for potential product and "non-product" liability. the company noted the following trends:
continued high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious
asbestos-related illness;
while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain
policyholders due to the continued high level of litigation activity;
continued moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity; and
the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants.
while
the company believes that over the past several years there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the company's overall asbestos exposure, there nonetheless
remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims.
during
2012, total gross and net asbestos-related payments decreased when compared with 2011, primarily resulting from a decline in both gross and net payments to policyholders with whom
the company has entered into settlement agreements. the home office and field office categories, which
table of contents
account
for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, experienced a modest reduction in gross asbestos-related payments during 2012 when compared with 2011, while net
asbestos payments were flat. payments on behalf of policyholders in these categories continue to be influenced by the high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where
individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury continue to target previously peripheral defendants. the number of policyholders tendering asbestos claims for the first time in 2012 and the
number of policyholders with open asbestos claims both increased slightly when compared with 2011.
the
company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder
bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. the company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office, field office and assumed reinsurance and other
categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. in addition, the company reviews its historical gross
and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. conventional actuarial methods are not
utilized to establish asbestos reserves nor have the company's evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.
the
completion of these reviews and analyses in 2012, 2011 and 2010 resulted in $175 million, $175 million and $140 million increases, respectively, in the company's net asbestos
reserves in each period. in each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of
policyholders in the home office category and by higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance accounts. the increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment
trends that continue to be moderately higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above. the increase in 2010 also reflected increases in costs
of litigating asbestos-related coverage matters and was partially offset by a $70 million benefit from the reduction in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance resulting from a favorable ruling
related to a reinsurance dispute. notwithstanding these trends, the company's overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high
degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.
net
asbestos losses paid in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $236 million, $284 million and $350 million, respectively. approximately 6%, 19% and 32% of total net paid losses in 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the company's liability.

the
"policyholders with settlement agreements" category includes structured settlements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to tpc, wellington accounts. reserves are based
on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. structured settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be
paid at scheduled times. coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums
and are
table of contents
only
made when valid claims are presented. wellington accounts refer to the 35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their
asbestos claims. many of the aspects of the wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms
under which the coverage can be accessed.
the
"home office and field office" category relates to all other policyholders and also includes unallocated ibnr reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related
coverage litigation. policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified
threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential "non-product" exposures, size of policyholder and geographic
distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. in addition to ibnr amounts contained in the reserves for "home office and field office" policyholders and the costs of litigating
asbestos coverage matters, the company has established a reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders, new claims
from policyholders reporting claims for the first time and policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation and direct actions against the company. during 2012, $502 million of reserves
included in "policyholders with settlement agreements" were reclassified to the unallocated ibnr component in the "home office and field office" category as a result of the u.s. district court ruling
on march1, 2012 that the conditions of the direct action settlements had not been satisfied. for a full discussion of these settlement agreements see the "asbestos direct action litigation"
section of note16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements. the "assumed reinsurance and other" category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool
participations.
on
january29, 2009, the company and ppg industries, inc ("ppg"), along with approximately 30 other insurers of ppg, agreed in principle to an agreement to settle asbestos-related
coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to ppg. the tentative settlement agreement has been incorporated into the modified third amended plan of reorganization ("amended plan") proposed as
part of the pittsburgh corning corp. ("pcc", which is 50% owned by ppg) bankruptcy proceeding. pursuant to the proposed amended plan, which was filed on january30, 2009, pcc, along with
enumerated other companies (including ppg as well as the company as a participating insurer), are to receive protections afforded by section524(g) of the bankruptcy code from certain
asbestos-related bodily injury claims. under the agreement in principle, the company has the option to make a series of payments over the next 20years totaling approximately $620 million to
the trust to be created under the amended plan, or it may elect to make a one-time discounted payment, which, as of march31, 2013, would total approximately $481 million (approximately $452
million after reinsurance). the agreement in principle with ppg is subject to numerous contingencies, including final court approval of the amended plan, and the company has no obligation to make the
settlement payment until all contingencies are satisfied. the company's obligations under this agreement in principle are included in the "home office and field office" category in the preceding
table.

environmental claims and litigation
the company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage
arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. for instance, the
comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with
respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake
their own remedial action. liability under cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties.
the
company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. the company believes that some court decisions
have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. these decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the company
prior to the mid-1980s. these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount
being sought by the claimant from the policyholder, and the company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.
the
resolution of environmental exposures by the company generally occurs through settlements with policyholders as opposed to claimants. generally, the company strives to extinguish any
obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder.
this form of settlement is commonly referred to as a "buy-back" of policies for future environmental liability. in addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance
obligation which the
table of contents
company
may have for other claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. the company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any
liability arising from known specified sites or claims. where appropriate, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the company. the company's general purpose
in executing these agreements is to reduce the company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs.
in
establishing environmental reserves, the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. in the course of this analysis,
the company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures. in addition, the company considers the many
variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature
of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall
nature of the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of
other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential
non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. the evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information
concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves.
in
its review of environmental reserves, the company considers: past settlement payments; changing judicial and legislative trends; its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental
coverage matters; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up actions for both on- and off-site waste disposal activities;
the potential for adverse development; the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements.
the
duration of the company's investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the
company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. these factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of
underlying litigation or claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the company and the willingness of the policyholder and the company to negotiate, if appropriate,
a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and policyholder-by-policyholder, the company
cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim. however, based upon the company's experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several
years.
the
company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980's. these policyholders
continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing
to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. overall net environmental claim payments in 2012 were essentially unchanged from 2011. over the
past several years, the company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory
judgment actions relating to environmental matters. the degree to which those favorable trends have continued, however, has been less than anticipated. as a result, in 2012 and 2011, the company
increased its net environmental reserves by $90million and $76million, respectively. in 2010, the company increased its net environmental reserves by $35million due to a modest
upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders.
table of contents
net
environmental losses paid in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $84million, $86million and $77million, respectively. at december31, 2012, approximately 93% of
the net environmental reserve (approximately $323million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the
anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. the bulk reserve the company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process
environmental claims and the company's experience in resolving those claims. the balance, approximately 7% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $24million), consists of case
reserves.

uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves
as a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and
environmental claims at december31, 2012 are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. however, the uncertainties surrounding the final
resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject to
revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any
impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and
environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of
available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the company,
future developments pertaining to the company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to
policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. in addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of
policyholders and other defendants. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory
table of contents
and
legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. this environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court
and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is
also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the
dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be
effective. as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments. (also see note16 of notes
to the consolidated financial statements in this report).
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the company's current reserves. in addition, the company's estimate of claims and
claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot
now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the company's operating results in future periods.
investment portfolio
the company's invested assets at december31, 2012 were $73.84billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and
short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate and 5% in other investments. because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments,
the company employs a conservative investment philosophy. a significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid taxable u.s.
government, tax-exempt u.s. municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds.
the
carrying value of the company's fixed maturity portfolio at december31, 2012 was $65.39billion. the company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity
investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the company's insurance and debt obligations. the weighted average credit
quality of the company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding u.s. treasury securities, was "aa2" at both december31, 2012 and 2011. in 2011, standard& poor's
downgraded the credit rating of securities issued by the u.s. government, which had minimal impact on the overall credit quality of the company's fixed maturity portfolio at december31, 2011.
below investment grade securities represented 3.1% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at both december31, 2012 and 2011. the average effective duration of fixed maturities and
short-term securities was 3.2 (3.4 excluding short-term securities) at both december31, 2012 and 2011. see the "outlook" section in
"item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."

obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions
the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2012 and 2011 included $38.68billion and
$39.02billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). the municipal
bond portfolio is diversified across the united states, the district of columbia and puerto rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts
and similar issuers. included in the municipal bond portfolio at december31, 2012 and 2011 were $9.03billion and $7.33billion, respectively, of advance refunded or
escrowed-to-maturity bonds (collectively referred to as pre-refunded bonds), which are bonds for which an irrevocable trust has been established to fund the
remaining payments of principal and interest. such escrow accounts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the underwriter, issuer or trustee and are almost
exclusively comprised of u.s. treasury securities. moody's investors service has assigned negative outlooks to municipal securities in both the state sector and local government sector within the
united states.

the
company bases its investment decision on the underlying credit characteristics of the municipal security. while its municipal bond portfolio includes a number of securities that were
enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default, the company does not rely on enhanced credit characteristics provided by such third-party
insurance as part of its investing decisions. the downgrade during 2008 and 2009 of credit ratings of insurers of these securities resulted in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of many such
securities to the underlying rating of the respective security. of the insured municipal securities in the company's investment portfolio at december31, 2012, approximately 99% were rated at
a3 or above, and approximately 92% were rated at aa3 or above, without the benefit of insurance. the company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse
impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities, as well as the company's ability and intent to
hold the securities. the average credit rating of the underlying issuers of these securities was "aa2" at december31, 2012. the
average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was "aa1" at december31, 2012 with and without the enhancement provided by third-party insurance.

using external rating agencies or by the company when a public rating does not exist. the table includes $225million of short-term
securities which have the highest ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. for purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated
"a-1+" and/or "p-1," are included as "aaa" rated securities.
in
january 2012, standard& poor's downgraded the sovereign ratings of nine eurozone countries, including france (from "aaa" to "aa+"). in november 2012, moody's
downgraded the sovereign rating of france from "aaa" to "aa1."
in
addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the company has exposure totaling $276million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships
(both of which are included in other investments in the company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across europe. the company has unfunded commitments totaling
$145million to these partnerships. the company also has $4million of nonredeemable preferred stock (included in equity securities on the company's consolidated balance sheet) issued by
companies in the eurozone.
mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities
the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2012 and 2011 included $3.00billion and
$3.52billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (cmo), all of
which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). while prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when
interest rates move dramatically, the company's investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected
table of contents
interest
rate ranges. included in the totals at december31, 2012 and 2011 were $1.44billion and $1.82billion, respectively, of gnma, fnma and fhlmc (excluding fha project
loans) guaranteed residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities classified as available for sale. also included in those totals were residential cmos classified as available for sale
with a fair value of $1.56billion and $1.70billion, at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. approximately 43% and 38% of the company's cmo holdings at december31,
2012 and 2011, respectively, were guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by gnma, fnma or fhlmc. the average credit rating of the $893million and $1.05billion of
non-guaranteed cmo holdings at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, was "b2" and "ba1," respectively. the average credit rating of all of the above securities was "a1" and
"aa3" at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
the
company makes investments in residential cmos that are either guaranteed by gnma, fnma or fhlmc, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective
securitizations. both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential cmos allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. in
addition, non-guaranteed residential cmos provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. senior and super-senior cmos are protected, to
varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. the company's investment strategy is to purchase cmo tranches that are expected to offer the
most favorable return given the company's assessment of associated risks. the company does not purchase residual interests in cmos.
alternative documentation mortgages and sub-prime mortgages
at december31, 2012 and 2011, the "mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through
securities" and "asset-backed and other" categories in the foregoing table included collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages and asset-backed securities
collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a collective fair value of $347million and $351million, respectively (comprising less than 1% of the company's total fixed
maturity investments at both dates). the continued disruption in secondary investment markets provided the company with the opportunity to selectively acquire additional mortgage-backed securities at
discounted prices in recent years. the
company purchased $11million and $128million of such securities in the years ended december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the company defines sub-prime
mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: low fico scores, above-prime interest rates, high
loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the
government-sponsored entities' requirements for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entities' guidelines for documentation, property type, debt and
loan-to-value ratios. the average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the company was "ba1" and "baa2" at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans
at december31, 2012 and 2011, the company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including fha project loans) of
$453million and $446million, respectively. the company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or
liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities.
equity securities available for sale, real estate and short-term investments
see note1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset
classes.
table of contents
other investments
at december31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying value of the company's other investments was $3.43billion and
$3.45billion, respectively. the company's other investments are
primarily comprised of private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships, joint ventures, mortgage loans, venture capital (through direct ownership and limited partnerships)
and trading securities, which are subject to more volatility than the company's fixed maturity investments. these asset classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities but are
subject to more volatility. net investment income provided by these asset classes was $414million, $292million and $304million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the
increase in 2012 was primarily driven by improved results from the company's real estate partnerships and hedge fund investments.
securities lending
the company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its
investments to other institutions for short periods of time. at december31, 2012 and 2011, the company had $403million and $126million of securities on loan, respectively, as
part of a tri-party lending agreement. the average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2012 and 2011 was $197million and $170million, respectively. borrowers of
these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. the company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities
lending program for the years ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

catastrophe modeling
the company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to analyze
catastrophic events and the risks associated with them. the company uses these analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic
events. there are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.
the
company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling
processes. the company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share
table of contents
analyses
and various other factors to account for non-modeled losses to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. these proprietary models are continually updated as new information
emerges.
the
tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts
(expressed in dollars and as a percentage of the company's common equity), based on the current version of the proprietary and third-party computer models utilized by the company at
december31, 2012. for example, on the basis described below the tables, the company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the company's loss from a single u.s. hurricane in a
one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $1.4billion, or 6% of the company's common equity at december31, 2012.

(1)an
event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a "1-in-50year event." as noted
above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not
over a multi-year timeframe. also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular
period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe.
(2)the
percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a)indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b)total common equity excluding net
unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes. net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily
indicative of operating trends. accordingly, the company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane
or single earthquake on the company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.
the
threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the company's in-force portfolio at december31, 2012 and catastrophic reinsurance program at
january1, 2013, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude most loss adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. the amounts for
hurricanes reflect u.s. exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. the hurricane loss amounts are
based on the company's catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge. the amounts for earthquakes reflect u.s.
table of contents
and
canadian exposures and include property exposures and workers' compensation exposures. the company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other
geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.
catastrophe
modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. these inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may
result in volatility in the modeled output. catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. catastrophe
modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. consequently, catastrophe
modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. in the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of
exceedance decreases. in other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g.,1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable.
actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. in addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.
moreover,
the company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed
to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and acts
of terrorism.
for
more information about the company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see "item1arisk
factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and
could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and "item1arisk factorswe may be adversely affected if
our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results."
changing climate conditions
severe weather events over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created
uncertainty regarding insurers' exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophes and other weather-related events. some scientists believe that, in recent years, changing climate conditions
have added to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters. for example, in recent years hurricane activity has impacted areas further inland
than previously experienced, thus expanding the company's potential for losses from hurricanes. additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the united states have been
greater in recent years. further, any reduction in arctic sea ice may contribute to rising sea levels that could impact flooding in coastal areas. accordingly, if climate conditions are changing, the
company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events. additionally, the company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased
unpredictability, frequency and severity of severe weather events.

company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under "risk factors" in item1a of this report and under
"outlook" herein. for example, among other things:
increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under
policies issued by the company. see "risk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could
adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and "outlookunderwriting gain/loss."
table of contents
changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the company invests.
for example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers in the southwestern united states, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of
issuers in the southeastern united states, among other areas. see "risk factorsour investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses."
increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the company and its
customers. for example, state insurance regulation could impact the company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. if the company is unable to
implement risk based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased
losses occur), its business may be adversely affected. see "risk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or
liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance."
the full range of potential liability exposures related to climate change continues to evolve. through the company's
emerging issues committee and its committee on climate, energy and the environment, the company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess
climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. see "risk factorsthe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our
business are uncertain."
climate
change regulation also could increase the company's customers' costs of doing business. for example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less
available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. also, increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity, which would
decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses.
the
company regularly reviews emerging issues, such as changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help
determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products.
reinsurance recoverables
ceded reinsurance involves credit risk, except with regard to mandatory pools for which liability is mostly joint and several, and is
generally subject to aggregate loss limits. although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks
reinsured. reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts. the company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on
an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically. reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices and the price of their product offerings. after
reinsurance is purchased, the company has limited ability to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer. in addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the european union and the united kingdom, a
reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance
arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority.
the
company holds collateral, including trust agreements, escrow funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. the company has also entered into master security
agreements with certain reinsurers. these agreements define conditions that require the reinsurer to provide collateral. the specific conditions and the amounts and form of collateral to be provided
by these

agreements
vary based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the reinsurers' legal structure and trading history with the company.

purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. the following table presents the company's top five groups

reinsurance
companies and life insurance companies have been negatively impacted by turbulent economic conditions, significant catastrophe events and investment portfolio challenges in
recent years. a number of such companies have been subjected to downgrades and/or negative outlook changes by various ratings agencies, including those with which the company conducts business. the
company considers these factors in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts.
outlook
the following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the company's results of operations and capital
position.
premiums.the company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. net written premiums comprise both renewal
business and new
business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. when business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease
(renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles
or properties insured). net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions,
which, particularly in the case of the business insurance segment, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. net written premiums are also impacted
by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs.
given
the possibility that more active weather patterns such as the company experienced in a number of recent periods may continue, as well as the possibility that interest rates may
remain low for some period of time, along with the current level of profitability in certain of its product lines, the company has undertaken efforts to improve its underwriting margins. these efforts
include seeking improved rates, as well as improved terms and conditions on many of its insurance products, and also include other initiatives, such as reducing operating expenses and acquisition
costs. these efforts may not be successful and/or may result in lower retention and new business levels and therefore lower business volumes. in particular, in the agency automobile line of business,
the company has undertaken various actions to improve its underwriting margins, which have been negatively impacted by various factors. if these actions are not effective, the company may need to
explore other actions or initiatives to improve its competitive position and profitability in this line of business. refer to "partiitem1arisk
factorsthe intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability" in this report.
nonetheless,
the company currently expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong relative to
historical experience. the company also expects to continue to achieve price increases on renewal business during 2013 that generally exceed loss cost trends. in the business insurance segment, the
company expects that renewal premium changes during 2013 will be broadly consistent with the higher levels
table of contents
attained
in the fourth quarter of 2012 and will be driven by both positive renewal rate changes and, subject to the economic uncertainties discussed below, growth in insured exposures. in the
financial, professional& international insurance segment, the company expects that renewal premium changes will modestly improve during 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. with
respect to construction surety, the company expects written premium volume to be broadly consistent with the levels attained in 2012. in the personal insurance segment, the company expects both agency
automobile and agency homeowners and other renewal premium changes during 2013 will decline slightly as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, but are expected to remain positive and exceed
underlying loss cost trends, assuming weather patterns consistent with the company's expectations. renewal premium changes for both agency automobile and agency homeowners and other in 2013 are
expected to be driven by both positive renewal rate changes (based on the company's actions to file for rate increases) and, subject to the economic uncertainties discussed below, growth in insured
exposures. the need for state regulatory approval for changes to personal property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal
premium changes.
the
pricing environment for new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal rate changes, given the volume of new business relative to renewal
business. property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2013 for new business, not only in business insurance and financial, professional&
international insurance, but especially in personal insurance, where price comparison technology used by agents and brokers, sometimes referred to as "comparative raters," has facilitated the process
of generating multiple quotes, and thereby increasing price comparison on new business and, increasingly, on renewal business. in addition, the company launched a new distribution channel in 2009 that
markets personal insurance products directly to consumers, which is expected to continue to generate modest growth in premium volume for personal insurance during 2013.
current
economic conditions have been somewhat volatile, and there is increased uncertainty as to whether the u.s. or the global economy will grow modestly, remain stagnant or enter a
recession. economic growth experienced in 2011 and 2012 may or may not continue, or may continue at a slower rate for an extended period of time. in addition, some economic conditions, such as the
commercial and residential real estate environment and employment rates, may continue to be weak. future actions or inactions of the united states government, including a failure to increase the
government debt limit or a shutdown of the federal government, could increase the actual or perceived risk that the u.s. may not ultimately pay its obligations when due and may disrupt financial
markets. further, general uncertainty regarding the u.s. federal budget and taxes has added to the uncertainty regarding economic conditions generally.
if
weak economic conditions persist or deteriorate, the resulting low levels of economic activity could impact exposure changes at renewal and the company's ability to write business at
acceptable rates. additionally, low levels of economic activity could adversely impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written.
all of the foregoing,
in turn, could adversely impact net written premiums during 2013, and, since earned premiums lag net written premiums, earned premiums could be adversely impacted following 2013.
underwriting gain/loss.the company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or
unfavorable
prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins.
catastrophe
and other weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. the company experienced significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses in a
number of recent periods which adversely impacted its results of operations. the company's results of operations
table of contents
would
continue to be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses were to occur during 2013.
for
the last several years, the company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development, although at lower levels in some recent years, driven
by better than expected loss experience in all of the company's segments. the lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development in a number of recent periods may have been in part due to the
company's reserve estimation process incorporating those factors that led to the higher levels of net favorable prior year reserve development in previous years. if that trend continues, the better
than expected loss experience may continue at these recent lower levels, or even lower levels. however, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss
experience could develop such that the company recognizes higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year
reserve development in future periods. in addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the
company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.
in
business insurance, the company expects that the anticipated impact of increases in renewal premium changes, partially offset by an expected modest increase in underlying losses, and
assuming weather patterns consistent with the company's expectations, will likely result in underlying underwriting margins during 2013 that are higher than in 2012. in financial,
professional& international insurance, the company expects that the anticipated impact of lower underlying losses due to recent underwriting actions in the segment and increases in renewal
premium changes in bond& financial products will likely result in underlying underwriting margins during 2013 that are modestly higher than in 2012. in personal insurance, the company
anticipates underlying underwriting margins
during 2013 that are broadly consistent with 2012. in agency automobile, the company anticipates an improvement in underlying underwriting margins during 2013 due to the anticipated impact of
continued positive renewal premium changes, partially offset by loss cost trends. in agency homeowners and other, the company anticipates a decline in underlying underwriting margins during 2013,
reflecting a return to non-catastrophe weather-related loss levels consistent with the company's expectations. also in personal insurance, the company's direct to consumer initiative, as
discussed above, while intended to enhance the company's long-term ability to compete successfully in a consumer-driven marketplace, is expected to remain unprofitable for a number of
years as this book of business grows and matures.
investment portfolio.the company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment
portfolio
and a relatively short average effective duration. the average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 3.2 (3.4 excluding short-term securities) at december31,
2012. in 2013, subject to market conditions, the company plans to increase its short position in u.s. treasury futures, which it uses to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. the
company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. currently, the majority of the company's investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid taxable
u.s. government, tax-exempt u.s. municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds.
the
company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships, joint ventures, mortgage
loans, venture capital (through direct ownership and limited partnerships) and trading securities. these investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher
degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.
net
investment income is a material contributor to the company's results of operations. interest rates remain at very low levels by historical standards. based on the current interest
rate environment,
table of contents
the
company estimates that the impact of lower reinvestment yields on the company's fixed maturity portfolio could, in 2013, result in approximately $30million of lower after-tax
net investment income from that portfolio on a quarterly basis as compared to the corresponding quarter of 2012. given recent general economic and investment market conditions, the company expects
investment income from the non-fixed maturity portfolio for 2013 to be lower than in 2012. if general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions deteriorate in 2013, the
company could also experience a reduction in net investment income and/or significant realized investment losses, including impairments. for further discussion of the company's investment portfolio,
see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationsinvestment portfolio" in this report. for a discussion of the risks to the company's business during or following a financial market disruption and risks to the company's
investment portfolio, see the risk factors entitled "during or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected" and "our
investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses" included in "risk factors" in parti, item1a of this report.
capital position.the company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value,
expects to
continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders. in recent years, the company has returned capital to its shareholders, comprising dividends to common
shareholders and common share repurchases, in amounts that have exceeded its operating income. the company now expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders
and common share repurchases will likely not exceed operating income. in addition, actual amounts of common share repurchases will also depend on a variety of additional factors, including corporate
and regulatory requirements, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company's existing ratings from independent rating agencies, share price, funding of the company's qualified pension plan,
strategic initiatives and other market conditions. for information regarding the company's common share repurchases in 2012, see "liquidity and capital resources" in this report.
the
company had a net after-tax unrealized investment gain of $2.98billion in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2012. while the company
does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce shareholders' equity,
and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects.
many
of the statements in this "outlook" section are forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the company's
control. actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. further, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report
and the company undertakes no obligation to update them. see "forward-looking statements." for a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the company's results of
operations or financial position, see "item1arisk factors" and "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationscritical accounting estimates" in this report.
liquidity and capital resources
liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business
operations and to satisfy general corporate purposes when needed. the liquidity requirements of the company have been met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, income received on
investments and investment maturities. cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments, operating expenses, debt servicing, taxes, shareholder
dividends and, in recent years, for common share repurchases. the timing and amount of catastrophe claims are inherently unpredictable. such claims increase liquidity requirements. the timing and
amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and
table of contents
reinsurance
coverage disputes. additionally, the variability of asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also
result in increased liquidity requirements. it is the opinion of the company's management that the company's future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the above sources.
at
december31, 2012, total cash and short-term invested assets aggregating $2.03billion and having a weighted average maturity of 76days were held in
the united states by the holding company. these assets are sufficient to meet the holding company's current liquidity requirements and are in excess of the company's minimum target level, comprising
the company's estimated annual pretax interest expense and common shareholder dividends, and currently totaling approximately $1.1billion. these liquidity requirements primarily include
shareholder dividends, debt service and contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan from time to time.
the
holding company is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. u.s. income taxes have not been recognized on
$755million of the company's foreign operations' undistributed earnings as of december31, 2012, as such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations.
furthermore, taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits against the u.s. tax on dividend distributions if such earnings were to be distributed to the holding company.
the amount of undistributed earnings from foreign operations and related taxes on those undistributed earnings were not material to the company's financial position or liquidity at december31,
2012.
the
company has a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which permits it to issue securities from time to time. the company also has a
$1.0billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in june 2013. this line of credit also supports the company's $800million commercial paper
program, of which $100million was outstanding at december31, 2012. the company is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs.
the
company currently utilizes uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately $392million to provide much of the capital needed
to support its obligations at lloyd's. if uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the company can collateralize these letters of credit or
may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at lloyd's, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand.
operating activities
net cash flows provided by operating activities were $3.23billion, $2.17billion and $3.05billion in 2012, 2011
and 2010, respectively. cash flows in 2012 primarily reflected a decrease in losses paid related to catastrophes, a lower level of paid losses related to asbestos claims and operations in runoff and a
higher level of collected premiums, partially offset by an increase in paid losses related to non-catastrophe ongoing business (including the impact of increased loss costs). cash flows in
2011 reflected an increase in losses paid related to catastrophes and ongoing business (including the impact of increased loss costs), a higher level of contributions to the company's qualified
domestic pension plan and lower receipts related to net investment income as compared with 2010. these factors were partially offset by a higher level of collected premiums, a lower level of paid
operating expenses and a lower level of paid losses related to asbestos claims and operations in runoff. in the years ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the company contributed
$217million, $185million and $35million, respectively, to its qualified domestic pension plan.
table of contents
investing activities
net cash flows used by investing activities in 2012 were $972million, compared with net cash flows provided by investing
activities of $1.15billion and $2.11billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively. the company's consolidated total investments at december31, 2012 increased by $1.14billion
from year-end 2011, driven by operating cash flows of $3.23billion and a $362million increase in net pretax unrealized appreciation of investments in 2012, partially offset
by the impact of the company's common share repurchases of $1.47billion under its share repurchase authorization, common shareholder dividends of $694million and debt repayments of
$258million.
on
december5, 2012, the company increased its ownership in j. malucelli participaes em seguros e resseguros s.a, its brazilian joint venture
(jmalucelli), through the exercise of a pre-existing option. as a result, the company increased its ownership to 49.5% of the venture. jmalucelli is currently the market leader in surety
in brazil based on market share. the company's investment was funded with cash provided internally from an operating subsidiary of the company.
the
company's investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly, the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders. as such, the primary
goals of the company's asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. generally,
the expected principal and interest payments produced by the company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company's insurance reserves. although this is not an exact
cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow
from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit
facilities.
financing activities
net cash flows used in financing activities were $2.15billion, $3.31billion and $5.22billion in 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively. the totals in each year reflected common share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and the repayment of debt, partially offset by the proceeds from employee stock option
exercises and, in 2010, the issuance of debt.
debt transactions.
2012.on may29, 2012, the company purchased and retired $8.5million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25%
fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures due march15, 2067 in an open market transaction. the company's $250million, 5.375% senior notes matured on
june15, 2012 and were paid from existing holding company liquidity.
2011.on june1, 2011, the company repaid the remaining $9million principal balance on its 7.22% real estate non-recourse
debt.
2010.on november1, 2010, the company issued $500million aggregate principal amount 3.90% senior notes that will mature on
november1, 2020, and $750million aggregate principal amount 5.35% senior notes that will mature on november1, 2040. the net proceeds of these issuances, after original issuance
discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, were approximately $496million and $738million, respectively. interest on the senior notes is
payable semi-annually in arrears on november1 and may1 of each year. the senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the company's
option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a)100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or (b)the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis

table of contents
then
current treasury rate (as defined) plus 15 basis points for the 2020 senior notes and 20 basis points for the 2040 notes.
prior
to november 2010, the company was subject to a replacement capital covenant that it had granted to the holders of its 6.75% senior notes due june20, 2036 (the senior
notes). the replacement capital covenant restricted the company's ability to repurchase its $1.00billion in outstanding 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated
debentures due march15, 2067 (the debentures). in november 2010, the company paid approximately $4million to holders of the senior notes to terminate the replacement capital covenant.
following the termination, the company purchased approximately $885million aggregate principal amount of the debentures. a $60million pretax loss was recognized in 2010 related to
these transactions.
on
september16, 2010, the company repaid the remaining $4million principal balance on its 7.81% private placement senior notes. on august23, 2010, the company's
$21million, 7.415% medium-term notes matured and were fully paid. on april15, 2010, the company's $250million, 8.125% senior notes matured and were fully paid. all
of these debt payments were made from internally-generated funds.
the
amount of debt obligations, other than commercial paper, that becomes due in 2013 is $500million. in 2014, no debt obligations become due. in 2015, the amount of debt
obligations, other than commercial paper, that comes due is $400million. the company may refinance maturing debt through funds generated internally or, depending on market conditions, through
funds generated externally, including as a result of the issuance of debt or other securities.
dividends.dividends paid to shareholders were $694million, $665million and $673million in 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.
the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the company's common stock will be at the discretion of the company's board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the
company's financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems
relevant. dividends will be paid by the company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the company. on
january22, 2013, the company announced that it declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, payable march29, 2013 to shareholders of record on march8, 2013.
share repurchases.the company's board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be
made from time
to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of rule10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, in private transactions
or otherwise. the authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the
company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal
requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions), market conditions and other factors. the following table summarizes repurchase activity in

from
the inception of the first authorization in may 2006 through december31, 2012, the company repurchased a cumulative total of 362.4million shares for a total cost of
$18.84billion, or an average of $51.99 per share.
in
2012, 2011 and 2010, the company acquired 0.9million, 1.4million and 1.3million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock
primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options.
conversion of preferred stock to common stock.in may 2011, the company's board of directors authorized the redemption of the company's
preferred
stock held by the travelers 401(k) savings plan (the savings plan) and gave notice of that redemption to the appropriate fiduciaries of the savings plan. following a fiduciary review, the savings plan
exercised its right to convert each preferred share into eight shares of the company's common stock. as a result, all preferred shares outstanding on june7, 2011 (190,083 shares) were
converted into a total of 1.52million shares of the company's common stock.
capital resources
capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise
new capital to meet its needs. the following table summarizes the components of the company's capital structure at december31, 2012 and 2011.

$1.45billion, shareholder dividends of $700million and debt repayments of $258million.

the
debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments is calculated by dividing (a)debt by (b)total capitalization
excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes. net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors
and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. accordingly, in the opinion of the company's management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis
provides another useful metric for investors to understand the company's financial leverage position. the company's debt-to-total capital ratio of 22.2% at december31,
2012 calculated on this basis was within the company's target range of 15% to 25%.
line of credit agreement.the company is party to a three-year, $1.0billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of
financial institutions that expires in june 2013. pursuant to the credit agreement covenants, the company must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth (generally defined as shareholders' equity plus
certain trust preferred and mandatorily convertible securities, reduced for goodwill and other intangible assets) of $14.35billion. the company must also maintain a ratio of total debt to the
sum of total debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than 0.40 to 1.00. in addition, the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of
default, including with respect to a change in control, which is defined to include the acquisition of 35% or more of the company's voting stock and certain changes in the composition of the company's
board of directors. at december31, 2012, the company was in compliance with these covenants. generally, the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from libor plus 100 basis points
to libor plus 175 basis points depending on the company's credit ratings. at december31, 2012, that cost would have been libor plus 125 basis points had there been any amounts outstanding
under the credit agreement. this line of credit also supports the company's commercial paper program.
shelf registration.the company has filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement for the
potential
offering and sale of securities to replace the company's
previous registration statement that had expired in the normal course of business. the company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of
offering.
share repurchase authorization.at december31, 2012, the company had $2.16billion of capacity remaining under its share
repurchase
authorization approved by the board of directors.
contractual obligations
the following table summarizes, as of december31, 2012, the company's future payments under contractual obligations and
estimated claims and claim-related payments. the table excludes short-term obligations and includes only liabilities at december31, 2012 that are expected to be settled in cash.
the
table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related payments. the amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates,
generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques, at a given accounting date. these estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on
the company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other
factors. variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends
and legislative changes. many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the
policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. the future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount (including severity
considerations) and timing. amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. an estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows

the
company has entered into reinsurance agreements to protect itself from potential losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept as described in note5 of notes to the company's
consolidated financial statements.
in
order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e.,the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk. since the
timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are
recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts. the presence of any feature
that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance (see below). the assumptions used in
estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities.
reinsurance
agreements that do not transfer both amount and timing risk are accounted for as deposits and included in "reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits" in the table above.

the
amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been
adjusted to reflect the time value of money. accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the company's balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and
the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet. (see note1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.)
table of contents
(7)workers'
compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under
such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. "claims from large deductible policies" represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related
expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. the liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance
sheet as "contractholder payables" and "contractholder receivables," respectively. most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder's escrow which is periodically replenished
by the policyholder. the payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within "claims and claim adjustment expenses" in the above table. because the timing of the collection of the
deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table.

(8)the
amounts in "loss-based assessments" relate to estimated future payments of second-injury fund assessments which would result from payment of
current claim liabilities. second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition. for loss-based assessments, the cost is
shared by the insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on losses. amounts relating to second-injury fund
assessments are included in "other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet.
(9)the
amounts in "reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits" represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted
for as deposits. amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in "other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet. the amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and
have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the company's balance sheet to the extent that deposit values in the balance sheet have been
discounted using deposit accounting.
(10)the
amounts in "payout from ceded funds withheld" represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance
arrangements whereby the company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held.
(11)the
company's current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are $657million. offsetting these liabilities
are deferred tax assets of $594million associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized.
the
above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event
of default by the company issuing the annuity. the company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements. in addition, the company is not currently
subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan. accordingly, future contributions are not included in the foregoing table.
dividend availability
the company's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the state of connecticut. the insurance holding company laws of
connecticut applicable to the company's subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any
table of contents
dividend
that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer's capital and surplus as of the preceding december31, or the
insurer's net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding december31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. this
declaration or payment is
further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. the insurance holding company laws of other states in which the company's subsidiaries
are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. a maximum of $2.05billion is available by the end of
2013 for such dividends without prior approval of the connecticut insurance department. the company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2013 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its
insurance subsidiaries in 2013, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the connecticut insurance department.
the
holding company is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. the undistributed earnings of the company's
foreign operations are not material and are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations.
the
holding company received $1.96billion of dividends in 2012, all of which was received from its u.s. insurance subsidiaries.
pension and other postretirement benefit plans
the company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the qualified plan), which covers
substantially all u.s. domestic employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula. in addition, the company sponsors: a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers
certain highly-compensated employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and
service requirements and for certain retirees.
the
qualified plan is subject to regulations under the employee retirement income act of 1974 as amended (erisa), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and requires
such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the pension benefit guaranty corporation (pbgc). the company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the qualified plan for 2013
and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2014. the company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements.
the company made discretionary contributions to the qualified plan of $217million, $185million, and $35million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. in determining future
contributions, the company will consider the performance of the plan's investment portfolio, the effects of interest rates on the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the company's other
capital requirements. the company has not determined whether or not additional discretionary funding will be made in the current year or beyond. however, the company currently believes, subject to
actual plan performance and funded status at the time, that it may make discretionary pension contributions of approximately $75million to $100million annually over the next few years.
the
qualified plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return. the company's overall strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for
long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. the current target allocations for
plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. for 2013, the company plans to apply an expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.50%, the same rate as in 2012. the rates of return reflect the company's current expectations of long-term returns on the plan's
invested assets, taking into account the current low level of long-term interest rates as well as the federal reserve's commentary in january 2013 regarding its expectation to maintain
interest rates at their current low levels until the national unemployment rate drops to 6.5%. the company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets also contemplates a return to
more normal levels of long-term interest rates in the future.

for further discussion of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see note14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
risk-based capital
the naic has risk-based capital (rbc) requirements for property casualty companies to be used as minimum capital
requirements by the naic and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory action. the formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate
with levels of capital above the rbc requirements. therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. at december31, 2012, all of the
company's insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any company or regulatory action.
off-balance sheet arrangements
the company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to the sale of business entities, certain
investments, third-party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications. see note16 of notes to
the company's consolidated financial statements. the company does not expect these arrangements will have a material effect on the company's financial position, changes in financial position, revenues
and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
critical accounting estimates
the company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and
related reinsurance recoverables, investment valuation and impairments, and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments.

the
$470million decrease in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since december31, 2011 primarily reflected the impact of net favorable prior year reserve
development and payments related to significant catastrophe losses incurred in 2011 as well as operations in runoff
table of contents
(including
asbestos and environmental claims), partially offset by the increase in loss cost trends and catastrophe losses incurred in 2012.
asbestos
and environmental reserves are included in the general liability, commercial multi-peril and international and other lines in the foregoing summary table. asbestos and
environmental reserves are discussed separately; see "asbestos claims and litigation", "environmental claims and litigation" and "uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental
reserves."
claims
and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims
that have been incurred but not yet reported (ibnr). claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates,
generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. these estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost
upon final resolution in the future, based on the company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and
frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. in establishing gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, the company also considers salvage and
subrogation. estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in "reinsurance recoverables" as an asset on the company's consolidated balance sheet. the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company.
the
process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables can be affected by both
internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative
changes, among others. the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. estimation difficulties also differ significantly by
product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time
between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual
experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. the company continually refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims
are reported and settled. the company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established. due to the
inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses
may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially
different than the amount currently recordedfavorable or unfavorable.
because
establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves may change. the company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.
there
are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes and other
catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and
regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding
versus wind; evaluating general liability
table of contents
and
pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and
reinsurance collectibility. the timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the company in estimating reserves for that
reporting period. the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.
a
portion of the company's gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $3.04billion at december31, 2012) are for asbestos and environmental claims and
related litigation. while the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded
theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the company's management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties
regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the company's future operating results. see the preceding
discussion of "asbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation."
general discussion
the process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim
data. data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated
by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line. such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. the process of analyzing
reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information.
multiple
estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and
disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. the relative
strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change
with each evaluation. the estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated.
in
most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. this will result in a range of reasonable
estimates for any particular claim liability. the company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable, given
subsequent information. reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. these reviews may substantiate the validity of
management's recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate.
the
exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for
an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. as a result, the company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. in
addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process.
property-casualty
insurance policies are either written on a claims-made or on an occurrence basis. claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements
in individual policies, claims reported during the policy period. policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured
table of contents
demonstrate
that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later.
most
general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. these policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years
following the policy issuance. the occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction
general liability, including construction defect. occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation,
judicial interpretations and societal litigation trends (e.g.,size of jury awards and propensity of individuals to pursue litigation), among others.

basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors
discussed below. to the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if
available and when appropriate, external data. such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim
portfolio and the known change being evaluated. significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process.
informed
judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. this includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. in
addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. therefore, management may have to
consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. it is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger,
consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult.
the
variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the
reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line.
product
lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final
resolution of those claims. short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. the longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to
estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty.
a
major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. the reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes
estimating ibnr inherently more uncertain. in addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of ibnr to the total claim liability for the product line. writing new products with
material reporting lags can result in adding several years' worth of ibnr claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with
pricing and reserving such products. the most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims.
for
some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. these lines are generally referred to as being "low frequency/high severity," while lines without
this "large claim" sensitivity are referred to as "high frequency/low severity." estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number
of potentially large claims. as a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. in contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is
relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable.
table of contents
claim
complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and
claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater
estimation uncertainty.
actuaries
have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. the human element in the application of actuarial
judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional
experiences and areas of focus. hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other.
lastly,
significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. events such as mergers increase the
inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization.
risk factors
the major causes of material uncertainty ("risk factors") generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately
analyzed component of the product line. in a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. for example, a method may explicitly
assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. actual results will
likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently.
some
risk factors will affect more than one product line. examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions,
court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line.
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components.
the
effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. for example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the
risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors.
the
evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. for example, the timing of claims payments in one
geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region.
while
some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more
evolutionary. evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. the final
impact is not known until all steps have occurred.
sudden
changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. evolutionary changes
generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable.

actuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
the principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the company's actuaries to evaluate management's existing estimates for prior
accident periods are the paid development method, the case incurred development method, the bornhuetter-ferguson (bf) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development
method. the bf method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible. these
are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods. (see glossary for an explanation of these methods).
while
these are the principal methods utilized throughout the company, actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods
developed within the casualty actuarial profession. the company's actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of
new techniques that might improve current and future estimates.
some
components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component. in such cases, the
company's actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims. the reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described
above. the reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods, such as:
estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods,
adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available.
utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate
accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates. (this monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates.)
utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the
estimated ultimate small claims from conventional analysis.
ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental).
the
results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including paid-to-incurred loss ratios, implied
incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios and non-zero claim severity trends. an actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss
development to expected development embedded within management's best estimate. additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other
actuarial methods.
the
methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management's existing estimate for prior accident periods. for the initial estimate of the current accident year, the
available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. hence, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method, which uses the
earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio. the projected loss ratio is determined through an analysis of prior
periods' experience, using loss trend, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years. the
exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component, based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate.
management's estimates
at least once per quarter, certain members of company management meet with the company's actuaries to review the latest claims and
claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. based on these
table of contents
analyses,
management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. in doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information
or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. for example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being
available to process claims. the resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability.
such
an assessment requires considerable judgment. it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. even if a change
is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. the overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several
months to perform. this is because the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. it may also
include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. as a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected
in the company's estimated claim liabilities. the final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new
actionable information.
the
audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for providing oversight of reserving propriety, and annually reviews the process by which the company establishes reserves.
discussion of product lines
the following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. there are many additional risk factors
that may impact ultimate claim costs. each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves.
for example, in workers' compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs.
thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation.
in
order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over
a one-year period are provided for the u.s. product lines. this information is provided for both the company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most
recent publicly available data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. these changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual
statement data found in schedulep of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided
by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense. data presented for the company includes history for the entire
travelers group (u.s. companies only), whether or not the individual subsidiaries were originally part of spc or tpc. this treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by
state regulatory authorities for schedulep. comparable data for non-u.s. companies is not available.
general liability
general liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims
from a given accident year. the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as
self-insured retentions. there are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a
given accident year closed within five to sevenyears), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g.,a reporting lag of a decade or more for
"construction defect" claims).
table of contents
while
the majority of general liability coverages are written on an "occurrence" basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional
liability) are typically insured on a "claims-made" basis.
general
liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property
damage. bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder's legal obligation arising from non-intentional
acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. in some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future
medical treatment costs. property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant's private property arising from the policyholder's legal obligation for non-intentional
acts. in most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter.
in
addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. these exposures include asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect and large unique accounts that
would otherwise distort the analysis. these unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods.
defense
costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. for some products this
risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim. such "defense within the limits" policies are most
common for "claims-made" products. when defense costs are outside of the limits, amounts paid for defense costs do not erode the policy limits.
this
line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the united states (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). major contributors to
this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e.,the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties
involved in the underlying tort action, whether the "event" triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the
individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e.,coverage dispute potential), and the
potential for mass claim actions. claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. this is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have
ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars
involved and the underlying settlement complexity). claims with long latencies also increase the
potential recognition lag (i.e.,the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure).
the
amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. the components in this product line with the longest latency,
longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity
issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect and other mass tort actions. many components of general liability are not subject to material
latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. in general, policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags, fewer
parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no
mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics.
table of contents
in
addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development and s-curve methods for
the construction defect components of this product line. the construction defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for ibnr claim counts.
for components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the company relies more heavily on the bf method than on the paid and case incurred
development methods.
examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:
general
liability risk factors
changes in claim handling philosophies
changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions
new theories of liability
trends in jury awards
changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues
changes in the propensity to litigate rather than settle a claim
changes in statutes of limitations
changes in the underlying court system
distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues
changes in tort law
shifts in lawsuit mix between federal and state courts
changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data)
the potential impact of inflation on loss costs
changes in settlement patterns

changes in policy provisions (e.g.,deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)
changes in underwriting standards
product mix (e.g.,size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix)
unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability
(excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future
calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied
from -8% to 10% (averaging -1%) for the company and from -5% to 6% (averaging -1%) for the industry overall. the company's
year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. because the high end of the company's range of historical adverse development comes from
certain businesses that the company has since exited, the company believes that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in
reserve estimates for this product line. general liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 24% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves.
table of contents
the company's change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, was -3% for 2012,
-8% for 2011 and -5% for 2010. the 2012 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2009 and prior and reflected what the company believes are more
favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected. also contributing to the 2012 change was better than expected results for management liability business, primarily
for the errors& omissions and fiduciary products for accident years 2007 and prior. the 2011 change was concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2005-2008 and reflected
what the company believes are more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected. the 2010 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident
years 2006 and prior and reflected what the company believes are more favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected.
commercial property
commercial property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than
liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). it is generally
viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. the claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim
reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption
claims.
commercial
property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. examples of common risk
factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:
commercial
property risk factors
physical concentration of policyholders
availability and cost of local contractors
for the more severe catastrophic events, "demand surge" inflation, which refers to significant short-term
increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services
local building codes
amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims)
frequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed
court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding)
lags in reporting claims (e.g.,winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to
roofs and/or equipment on roofs)
court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations
commercial
property book of business risk factors
policy provisions mix (e.g.,deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)
changes in underwriting standards

changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1%
increase (decrease) in
table of contents
incremental
paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -34% to -5% (averaging
-18%) for the company, and from -14% to 2% (averaging -9%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and
are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for
this product line. commercial property reserves represent approximately 3% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
since
commercial property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for commercial property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. this is due
to the fact that the majority of the reserve for commercial property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. this recent accident year
uncertainty is relevant to commercial property because of weather-related events which, notwithstanding 2010 and 2011 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally
are not completely resolved until the following year. reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. the reserve estimates for this product line are also
potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for significant catastrophes such as the events of september11, 2001, hurricane katrina and storm sandy.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -22% for 2012, -5% for 2011 and -25% for 2010. the 2012 change primarily reflected
better than expected development for accident years 2009 through 2011, driven by favorable loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in 2011, and by higher subrogation and salvage
recoveries for accident years 2009 through 2011. the 2011 change primarily reflected better than expected development in the 2008 and 2009 accident years for certain large national property and ocean
marine exposures. the 2010 change primarily occurred in the 2008 and 2009 accident years as a result of better than expected loss development in industry-focused underwriting and target risk
underwriting.
commercial multi-peril
commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore,
includes both short and long tail coverages. for property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability
coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims.
the
reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. the reserving
risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. commercial multi-peril is generally sold to smaller-sized
accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and commercial property includes larger customers.
see
"commercial property risk factors" and "general liability risk factors," discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril.
unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial
multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -19% to 5% (averaging -6%)
for the company, and from -6% to 3%
table of contents
(averaging
-2%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes
that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. commercial multi-peril reserves (excluding
asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 7% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
as
discussed above, this line combines general liability and commercial property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -1% for 2012, 5% for 2011 and 1% for 2010. the 2011 change reflected unfavorable loss development driven by
late reporting of hail claims incurred in 2010.
commercial automobile
the commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail
coverages. the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. the payments that take longer to finalize and are more
difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. in general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate
severity. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.
commercial
automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. these last two
components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented.
the
company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. this is supplemented with detailed custom
analyses where needed.
examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:
bodily
injury and property damage liability risk factors
trends in jury awards
changes in the underlying court system
changes in case law
litigation trends
frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits
change in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents
changes in auto safety technology
subrogation opportunities
changes in claim handling philosophies
frequency of visits to health providers
number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers
types of health providers used

types of medical treatments received

changes in policy provisions (e.g.,deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.)
changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g.,long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus
non-fleets)
changes in underwriting standards
unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial
automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -10% to 7% (averaging -3%)
for the company, and from -3% to 2% (averaging -1%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on,
observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product
line. commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 7% for 2012, 5% for 2011 and -1% for 2010. the 2012 change reflected higher than expected severity in the
bodily injury coverage primarily for accident years 2010 and 2011. the 2011 change reflected worse than expected severity for the 2009 and 2010 accident years.
workers' compensation
workers' compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims
from a given accident year. while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course
of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. in addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker's life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going
medical care. despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency
with moderate severity. the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical
expense arising from a worker's injury, as such claims are subject to greater inflation risk. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk.
workers'
compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses.
examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers' compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:
indemnity
risk factors
time required to recover from the injury
table of contents
degree of available transitional jobs
degree of legal involvement
changes in the interpretations and processes of the workers' compensation commissions' oversight of claims(1)
future wage inflation for states that index benefits

unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for workers'
compensation, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -2% to 1% (averaging 0%) for the company,
and from -1% to 2% (averaging 0%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the
company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. workers'

determination of whether a given injury arose out of the scope of employment or the determination of the degree of injury where disputes exist.
table of contents
compensation
reserves represent approximately 34% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -2% in 2012, 0% in 2011 and -1% for 2010. the 2012 change was primarily driven by better than
expected frequency and severity related to lifetime medical claims for accident years 2008 and prior.
fidelity and surety
fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. it takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle fidelity
claims. the volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured's business operations, amount of policy limit and
attachment point of coverage. the uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. the high
frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates, whereas the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a
wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity policies.
surety
has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can
result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured. (large construction projects can take many years to complete.)
the frequency of losses in surety generally correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured contractor to fulfill its contractual obligations. the
company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through disciplined risk selection and adherence to underwriting standards. the volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of
business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract
funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of an insured's assets. certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. these can
include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. other claim factors affecting reserve variability of
surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g.,salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured.

changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for fidelity and surety,
a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -11% to 138% (averaging 10%) for the
company, and from -13% to 24% (averaging 2%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during
the year. because the high end of the company's range was due to acquired business in 2004, the company believes that the industry's range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible
one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 3% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
in
general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was -8% for 2012, -11% for 2011 and -6% for 2010. the 2012 change reflected better than
expected results primarily for the contract surety line of business for accident years 2008 and prior. the 2011 change primarily reflected better than expected development for accident years 2008 and
prior for the contract surety business. the 2010 change was driven by better than expected loss development due to lower than expected claim activity and loss severity, primarily for the contract
surety business in this product line for the 2008 and prior accident years.
personal automobile
personal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical
damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. reporting lags are
relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. it is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to
moderate severity product line. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.
table of contents
personal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision
claims and comprehensive claims. these last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented.

a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -9% to 3% (averaging -3%) for
the company, and from -4% to -1% (averaging -2%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based
on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this
product line.
table of contents
personal
automobile reserves represent approximately 5% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 2% for 2012, 3% for 2011 and 0% for 2010. the 2012 change was primarily driven by higher than expected bodily injury
severity for accident year 2011. the 2011 change reflected worse than expected severity for the 2007-2010 accident years.
homeowners and personal lines other
homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the
claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays
of several months are not unusual. the resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist.
the
liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags.
overall,
the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity.
homeowners
reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments.

reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business, which for statutory reporting purposes is included
with the general liability line of business) over the last nine years has varied from -31% to 3% (averaging -11%) for the company, and from -8% to -2%
(averaging -5%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes
that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. homeowners and personal lines other reserves
represent approximately 4% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
this
line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. while property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year
change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year,
which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which, notwithstanding 2010 and 2011
experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take
even longer to resolve.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business) was -11% for 2012, -7% for 2011 and 2% for 2010. the 2012
change reflected better than expected loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in 2011 and non-catastrophe losses incurred in accident years 2010 and 2011. the 2011 change
reflected better than expected loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in the first half of 2010. the 2010 change reflected unfavorable loss development in the 2009 accident year for
the homeowners' line of business that was driven by higher than anticipated late-reported claims related to storms in 2009.
international and other
international and other includes products written by the company's international operations, as well as all other products not
explicitly discussed above. the principal component of "other" claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of
non-u.s. exposures, and is runoff business.
international
and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. the common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the
individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the u.s. statutory reporting framework.
table of contents
due
to changes in the business mix for this line over time, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved,
e.g.,the republic of ireland and the united kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g.,u.s. excess liabilities
reinsured through the london market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the
distribution system (e.g.,underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g.,insured and insurer located in different countries). in
particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool
members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes.
international
and other reserves are generally analyzed by program/pool, country and general coverage category (e.g.,u.s. liabilityexcess of loss reinsurance, or
general liabilitymunicipalitiesby country). the business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage/jurisdiction. where the underlying
insured hazard is outside the united states, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the general liability and commercial property discussion above, provided that
reserves relating to insured hazards outside the united states are analyzed taking into account differences in the legal environment and differences in terms and conditions, including, for example and
where applicable, that in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy limits on certain liability coverages. where the underlying hazard is within the u.s., the coverage involved is typically
that of general liability and
commercial property, but on an excess or excess-of-loss reinsurance basis. excess exposure requires the insured to "prove" not only claims under the policy, but also the prior
payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy's attachment point.

unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for international and
other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves. international and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 7% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
international
and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff. comparative historical information is not available for international product
lines as insurers domiciled outside of the u.s. do not fileu.s. statutory reports. comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible
one-year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business. accordingly, the company has not included comparative analyses for international and other.

the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development.
amounts
recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers
under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the company becomes involved in
coverage disputes with its reinsurers. some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the company's rights and obligations under the
various reinsurance agreements. the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.
some
of the reinsurance agreements that the company entered into as part of its catastrophe bond programs are dual trigger contracts. all of these contracts meet the requirements to be
accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. the company's catastrophe bond programs are described in more detail in
"item1businesscatastrophe reinsurance."
the
company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. the allowance is based upon the company's ongoing review of
amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. accordingly, the establishment of
reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. from time to time, as a result of the
long-tailed nature of the underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, the company considers the
table of contents
commutation
of reinsurance contracts. changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges.
recoverables
attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the
company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities. recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate
primarily to workers' compensation service business. these recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies' obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company's voluntary
market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. in the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool's or association's
obligations, the other members' share of such obligation increases proportionally.
on
august17, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in new york state court captioned united states fidelity& guaranty company v. american
re-insurance company, et al., the trial court granted summary judgment for united states fidelity and guaranty company (usf&g), a subsidiary of the company, and
denied summary judgment for american re-insurance company, a subsidiary of munich re (american re), and three other reinsurers. by order dated october22, 2010, the trial court
corrected certain clerical errors and made certain clarifications to the august17, 2010 order. on october25, 2010, judgment was entered against american re and the other three
insurers, awarding usf&g $420million, comprising $251million ceded under the terms of the disputed reinsurance contract plus interest of 9% amounting to $169million as of that
date. the judgment, including the award of interest, was appealed by the reinsurers to the new york supreme court, appellate division, first department. on january24, 2012, the appellate
division affirmed the judgment. on january30, 2012, the reinsurers filed a motion with the appellate division seeking permission to appeal its decision to the new york court of appeals, and on
march12, 2012, the appellate division granted the reinsurers' motion. on february7, 2013, the court of appeals issued an opinion that largely affirmed the summary judgment in usf&g's
favor, while modifying in part the summary judgment with respect to two discrete issues and remanding the case to the trial court for determination of those issues. the company believes it has a
meritorious position on each of these issues and intends to pursue its claim vigorously. at december31, 2012, the claim totaled $470million, comprising $251million of
reinsurance recoverable plus interest which had grown to $219million as of that date. interest will continue to accrue at 9% until the claim is paid. the $251million of reinsurance
recoverable owed to usf&g under the terms of the disputed reinsurance contract has been reported as part of reinsurance recoverables in the company's consolidated balance sheet. the interest that
would be owed as part of any judgment ultimately entered in favor of usf&g is treated for accounting purposes as a gain contingency in accordance with fasb topic 450,  contingencies, and accordingly
has not been recognized in the company's consolidated financial statements.
investment valuation and impairments
fair value measurements
the company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair
value accounting guidance. the framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the
valuations when available. the disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. in
determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
that reflect the company's significant market assumptions. the level in the fair value hierarchy
table of contents
within
which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the hierarchy are as
follows:
level1unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the
company has the ability to access.
level2quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical
or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g.,interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default
rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.
level3valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. the unobservable inputs
reflect the company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use.
valuation of investments reported at fair value in financial statements
the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction
between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e.,not in a forced transaction. the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the
security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g.,a forced transaction. additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based
inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.
for
investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in
level1 of the hierarchy. the company receives the quoted market prices from a third party, nationally recognized pricing service (pricing service). when quoted market prices are unavailable,
the company utilizes a pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value, which is mainly used for its fixed maturity investments. the fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are
included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. if quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the company produces an estimate of fair value
based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as level2 or level3. the company
bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction.
fixed maturities
the company utilizes a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities. the pricing
service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. since fixed maturities other than u.s. treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily
basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which include available relevant market information, benchmark
curves, benchmarking of like securities,
sector groupings and matrix pricing. additionally, the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.
the
pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. the market inputs utilized
in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark
securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. the extent of the use of each market input depends on the
table of contents
asset
class and the market conditions. depending on the security, the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. for some securities, additional inputs may be
necessary.
the
pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. if
the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to
make assumptions for market-based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions.
the
fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed
maturities, other than u.s. treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. the estimated fair value of u.s. treasury
securities is included in the amount disclosed in level1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.
the
company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the company's knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained
are representative of the prices in the market. in addition, the company has periodic discussions with the pricing service to discuss any changes in their process and reactions to overall markets. the
company produces a report monthly that lists all price changes from the previous month in excess of 10%. the company reviews the report and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of
fair value. in addition, the company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing
service as well as reviewing reports that contain securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation (stale price review). the company also uses an additional independent pricing
service to further test the primary pricing service's valuation of the company's fixed maturity portfolio. these
processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the pricing service.
the
company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and, accordingly, estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an
internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. the underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the u.s.
treasury curve are the bofa merrill lynch u.s. corporate index and the bofa merrill lynch bb u.s. high yield index. the company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in
level2, since all significant inputs are market observable.
while
the vast majority of the company's municipal bonds and corporate bonds are included in level2, the company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are
not valued by the pricing service and, accordingly, estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. due to
the limited amount of observable market information, the company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in level3. the fair value of the fixed maturities for which the
company used an internal pricing matrix was $102million and $88million at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. additionally, the company holds a small amount of other fixed
maturity investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. for these fixed maturities, the company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). the
fair value of the fixed maturities for which the company received a broker quote was $128million and $162million at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. due to the
disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the company includes these fair value estimates in level3.

non-fixed maturities and other investments not reported at fair value
see note4 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the determination of fair value of
non-fixed maturities and valuation of investments not reported at fair value in the financial statements.
investment impairments
the company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary
impairments. some of the factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1)for fixed maturity investments, whether the company intends to
sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2)for non-fixed
maturity investments, the company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3)the likelihood of
the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities (i.e.,whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4)the length of time and extent to
which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5)the financial condition, near-term and
long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices.
other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities and equity securities
for fixed maturity investments that the company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company would
not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit
loss component in net realized investment gains (losses). the impairment related to all other factors is reported in other comprehensive income.
for
equity securities (including public common and non-redeemable preferred stock) and for fixed maturity investments the company intends to sell or for which it is more
likely than not that the company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses).
upon
recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the
other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains (losses). the new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however,
for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the
investment.
due
to the subjective nature of the company's analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the company
could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer. additionally, it is possible that the issuer's actual ability to
meet contractual obligations may be different than what the company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods.

future application of accounting standards
see note1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards
updates.
the
company is currently required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), as promulgated by the financial accounting
standards board (fasb). during the last several years, the securities and exchange commission (sec) has been evaluating whether, when and how international financial reporting standards (ifrs) should
be incorporated into the u.s. financial reporting system. before making a decision, the sec set forth a work plan to evaluate the remaining differences between gaap and ifrs, determine whether ifrs
represented high quality standards, consider how the international accounting standards board is funded and its governance structure, and examine the variations in the way ifrs was applied by various
foreign companies that file financial statements with the sec. in july 2012, the sec staff issued a final report on the sec work plan which concluded that ifrs provide high quality accounting
standards, but also indicated concerns with funding, consistency of application and enforcement of ifrs globally. the report did not give a recommendation to the sec on whether, when and how ifrs
should be incorporated into the u.s. financial reporting system. additionally, the sec has not indicated a timeline for further consideration of incorporating ifrs.
the
international accounting standards board (iasb) and the fasb are in the process of developing a global insurance standard that may involve methodologies for valuing insurance
contract liabilities that may be significantly different from the methodologies required by current gaap. in june 2012, the fasb issued a statement that indicated that based on the nature and totality
of differences between the fasb's and iasb's views, it is not likely that the two boards will achieve convergence on this project. the fasb further noted that the fasb and iasb have very different
perspectives on the project, given that the u.s. has existing guidance on insurance contracts whereas there is currently no comprehensive ifrs insurance standard for insurance contracts. as a result
of this, it is currently unclear what changes, if any, may be made to the accounting for insurance contracts under gaap as a result of this project.
the
fasb and the iasb also continue to complete three remaining projects intended to bring convergence between gaap and ifrs for revenue recognition, accounting for financial instruments
and leasing. these projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2013. the company is not able to predict whether it will choose to, or be required to, adopt ifrs or how the adoption of ifrs (or
the convergence of gaap and ifrs, including the joint project for valuing insurance contract liabilities) may impact the company's financial statements in the future.
forward-looking statements
this report contains, and management may make, certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. words such as "may," "will," "should," "likely," "anticipates," "expects,"
"intends," "plans," "projects," "believes," "estimates" and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. specifically, statements about the company's share repurchase
plans, expected margin improvement, future pension plan contributions and the potential impact of investment markets and other economic conditions on the company's investment
table of contents
portfolio
and underwriting results, among others, are forward looking, and the company may also make forward-looking statements about, among other
things:
its results of operations and financial condition (including, among other things, premium volume, premium rates, net and
operating income, investment income and performance, loss costs, return on equity, and expected current returns and combined ratios);
the sufficiency of the company's asbestos and other reserves;
the impact of emerging claims issues as well as other insurance and non-insurance litigation;
the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage;
catastrophe losses;
the impact of investment, economic and underwriting market conditions; and
strategic initiatives.
the
company cautions investors that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the company's control, that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements.
for
a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, see "item1arisk factors" and
"item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

the
company's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking
statements.
item7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
market risk
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates (inclusive of credit
spreads), foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related
underlying assets are traded. the following is a discussion of the company's primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of december31, 2012. the company's market risk
sensitive instruments, including derivatives, are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading.
the
carrying value of the company's investment portfolio at december31, 2012 and 2011 was $73.84billion and $72.70billion, respectively, of which 89% and 88% was
invested in fixed maturity securities, respectively. at both december31, 2012 and 2011, approximately 6.2% of the company's invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies. the
company's exposure to equity price risk is not significant. the company has no direct commodity risk and is not a party to any credit default swaps.
the
primary market risks to the investment portfolio are interest rate risk and credit risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. the portfolio duration relative to
the liabilities' duration is primarily managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions. for additional information regarding the company's investments, see notes3
and 4 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements as well as the "investment portfolio" and "outlook" sections of "item7management's discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations."
table of contents
the
primary market risk for all of the company's debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing. the company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing
opportunities as maturity dates approach. for additional information regarding the company's debt see note8 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements as well as the
"liquidity and capital resources" section of "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
the
company's foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the company's invested assets, insurance reserves and shareholders' equity denominated in foreign currencies. cash
flows from the company's foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies. the company purchases these investments primarily to fund
insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency, effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure. invested assets denominated in the british pound sterling
comprised approximately 2.4% of the total invested assets at both december31, 2012 and 2011. invested assets denominated in the canadian dollar comprised approximately 2.3% and 2.4% of the
total invested assets at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. invested assets denominated in other currencies at december31, 2012 and 2011 were not material.
there
were no other significant changes in the company's primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended december31, 2012 compared to the
year ended december31, 2011. the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting
periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.
sensitivity analysis
sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings, fair values or cash flows of market sensitive
instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period of time. in the company's sensitivity analysis model, a
hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. "near-term" means a period of time going
forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure, especially since this
sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value.
interest rate risk
in this sensitivity analysis model, the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss. the sensitivity analysis model includes
the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading: fixed maturities, non-redeemable preferred stocks, mortgage loans, short-term securities, debt
and derivative financial instruments. the primary market risk to the company's market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk (inclusive of credit spreads). the sensitivity analysis model uses
various basis point changes in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model.
for
invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk, estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result
from a parallel increase in interest rates. durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put and interest rate reset features. durations on tax-exempt securities are adjusted for
the fact that the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the u.s. treasury curve. fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted
basis, including accrued interest, using holdings as of december31, 2012 and 2011.
table of contents
for
debt, the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical december31, 2012 and 2011 ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a 100 basis point change,
comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices, and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding.
the
sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately $1.64billion and $1.79billion based on a
100 basis point increase in interest rates at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
the
loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from
emerging interest rate trends. in addition, the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company's financial instruments.
foreign currency exchange rate risk
the company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments. a
hypothetical 10% reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings. the company's analysis indicates that a
hypothetical 10% reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $459million and $452million at
december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

notes to consolidated financial statements
1. summary of significant accounting policies
basis of presentation
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the travelers companies,inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the
company). the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
claims and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. certain reclassifications have been made to the 2011 and 2010 financial statements to conform to the
2012 presentation. all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
adoption of accounting standards updates
testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
in july 2012, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued updated guidance regarding the impairment test applicable to
indefinite-lived intangible assets that is similar to the impairment guidance applicable to goodwill. under the updated guidance, an entity may assess qualitative factors (such as changes in
management, key personnel, strategy, key technology or customers) that may impact the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and lead to the determination that it is more likely than not
that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value. if an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value,
an impairment test must be performed. the impairment test requires an entity to calculate the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. if the carrying value of the
indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
the
updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending march31, 2013, but early adoption was permitted. the company adopted the updated guidance effective december31,
2012, and such adoption did not have any effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
testing of goodwill
in september 2011, the fasb issued updated guidance that modifies the manner in which the two-step impairment test of
goodwill is applied. under the updated guidance, an entity may assess qualitative factors (such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, key technology or customers) that may impact a
reporting unit's fair value and lead to the determination that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. if an entity
determines that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment test must be performed. the impairment test requires an entity to calculate
the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill in the same manner that goodwill is measured in a business combination. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
the
updated guidance was effective for the quarter ending march31, 2012. the adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on the company's results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
presentation of comprehensive income
in june 2011, the fasb issued updated guidance to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income by
eliminating the option of presenting components of comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders' equity. the updated guidance requires that all nonowner changes in
shareholders' equity be presented either as a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
the
updated guidance was effective for the quarter ended march31, 2012 and was applied retrospectively. the company's adoption of this guidance resulted in a change in the
presentation of the company's consolidated financial statements but did not have any effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements
in april 2011, the fasb issued updated guidance related to the accounting for repurchase agreements and other agreements that entitle
and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity. the updated guidance eliminates the criteria to assess whether a transferor is required to have the ability to
repurchase or redeem the financial assets in order to demonstrate effective control over the transferred asset. transferors that maintain effective control over a transferred asset are required to
account for the transaction as a secured borrowing rather than a sale.
the
updated guidance was effective for the quarter ended march31, 2012. the updated guidance applies to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or
after the effective date. the adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts
in october 2010, the fasb issued updated guidance to address diversity in practice for accounting for costs associated with acquiring
or renewing insurance contracts. this guidance modifies the definition of acquisition costs to specify that a cost must be directly related to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance
contract in order to be deferred. if application of this guidance would result in the capitalization of acquisition costs that had not previously been capitalized by a reporting entity, the entity may
elect not to capitalize those costs.
the
updated guidance was effective for the quarter ended march31, 2012. the adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on the company's results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.
accounting standard not yet adopted
reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income
in february 2013, the fasb issued updated guidance to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive
income. the guidance requires an entity to present, either on the face of the statement of income or in the notes, separately for each component of comprehensive income, the current period
reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income affected by the reclassification.

operations, financial position or liquidity.
accounting policies
investments
fixed maturity and equity securities
fixed maturities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks. fixed maturities, including instruments subject to securities
lending agreements, are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to other
comprehensive income. equity securities, which include public common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are classified as available for sale with changes in fair value, net of income
taxes, charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income.
real estate investments
the company's real estate investments include warehouses, office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly
owned. real estate is recorded on the purchase date at the purchase price, which generally represents fair value, and is supported by internal analysis or external appraisals that use discounted cash
flow analyses and other acceptable valuation techniques. real estate held for investment purposes is subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. buildings are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the expected useful life of the building or 39years. real estate held for sale is carried at lower of cost or fair value, less estimated
costs to sell.
short-term securities
short-term securities have an original maturity of less than one year and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates
fair value.
other investments
investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships
the
company uses the equity method of accounting for private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. the partnerships and the hedge funds generally report
investments on their balance sheet at fair value. the financial statements prepared by the investee are received by the company on a lag basis, with the lag period generally dependent upon the type of
underlying investments. the private equity and real estate partnerships provide financial information quarterly which is generally available to investors, including the company, within three to six
months following the date of the reporting period. the hedge funds provide financial information monthly, which is generally available to investors within one month following the date of the reporting
period. the company regularly requests financial information from the partnerships prior to the receipt of the partnerships' financial statements and records any material information obtained from
these requests in its consolidated financial statements.

other
also
included in other investments are non-public common and preferred equities, mortgage loans, trading securities and derivatives.
non-public common and preferred equities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. mortgage
loans are carried at amortized cost. trading securities are marked to market with the change in fair value recognized in net investment income during the current period. the company's derivative
financial instruments are carried at fair value, with the changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statement of income in net realized investment gains (losses). for a further discussion of
the derivatives used by the company, see note3.
net investment income
investment income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized based on the constant effective yield method which includes an
adjustment for estimated principal repayments, if any. the effective yield used to determine amortization for fixed maturities subject to prepayment risk (e.g.,asset-backed,
loan-backed and structured securities) is recalculated and adjusted periodically based upon actual historical and/or projected future cash flows, which are obtained from a widely-accepted
securities data provider. the adjustments to the yield for highly rated prepayable fixed maturities are accounted for using the retrospective method. the adjustments to the yield for
non-highly rated prepayable fixed maturities are accounted for using the prospective method. dividends on equity securities (including those with transfer restrictions) and venture capital
investments are recognized in income when declared. rental income on real estate is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. see note3 for further discussion. investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships
and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the company's share of the investee's earnings or losses in the fund is reported in net investment income. trading
securities are marked to market with the change in fair value recognized in net investment income during the current period.
accrual
of income is suspended on non-securitized fixed maturities or mortgage loans that are in default, or on which it is likely that future payments will not be made as
scheduled. interest income on investments in default is recognized only when payments are received. investments included in the consolidated balance sheet that were not income-producing for the
preceding 12months were not material.
for
fixed maturities where the company records an other-than-temporary impairment, a determination is made as to the cause of the impairment and whether the
company expects a recovery in the value. for fixed maturities where the company expects a recovery in value, not necessarily to par, the constant effective yield method is utilized and the investment
is amortized to the expected recovery amount.
investment gains and losses
net realized investment gains and losses are included as a component of pretax revenues based upon specific identification of the
investments sold on the trade date. included in net realized investment gains (losses) are other-than-temporary impairment losses on invested assets other than those
investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting as described in the "investment impairments" section that follows.

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
investment impairments
the company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary
impairments. some of the factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1)for fixed maturity investments, whether the company intends to
sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2)for non-fixed
maturity investments, the company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3)the likelihood of
the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities (i.e.,whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4)the length of time and extent to
which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5)the financial condition, near-term and
long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices.
other-than-temporary
impairments of fixed maturities and equity securities
for
fixed maturity investments that the company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company would not be required to sell
before an anticipated recovery in value, the company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net
realized investment gains (losses). the impairment related to all other factors is reported in other comprehensive income.
for
equity securities (including public common and non-redeemable preferred stock) and for fixed maturity investments the company intends to sell or for which it is more
likely than not that the company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses).
upon
recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the
other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains (losses). the new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however,
for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the
investment.
determination of credit lossfixed maturities
the company determines the credit loss component of fixed maturity investments by utilizing discounted cash flow modeling to determine
the present value of the security and comparing the present value with the amortized cost of the security. if the amortized cost is greater than the present value of the expected cash flows, the
difference is considered a credit loss and recognized in net realized investment gains (losses).
for
non-structured fixed maturities (u.s. treasury securities, obligations of u.s. government and government agencies and authorities, obligations of states, municipalities
and political subdivisions, debt securities issued by foreign governments, and certain corporate debt), the estimate of expected cash flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery
time frame and assessing whether further principal and interest will be received. the determination of recovery value incorporates an issuer valuation assumption utilizing one or a combination of
valuation methods as deemed appropriate

by
the company. the company determines the undiscounted recovery value by allocating the estimated value of the issuer to the company's assessment of the priority of claims. the present value of the
cash flows is determined by applying the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a
result of a previous impairment) and an estimated recovery time frame. generally, that time frame for securities for which the issuer is in bankruptcy is 12months. for securities for which the
issuer is financially troubled but not in bankruptcy, that time frame is generally 24months. included in the present value calculation are expected principal and interest payments; however,
for securities for which the issuer is classified as bankrupt or in default, the present value calculation assumes no interest payments and a single recovery amount.
in
estimating the recovery value, significant judgment is involved in the development of assumptions relating to a myriad of factors related to the issuer including, but not limited to,
revenue, margin and earnings projections, the likely market or liquidation values of assets, potential additional debt to be incurred pre- or post-bankruptcy/restructuring, the
ability to shift existing or new debt to different priority layers, the amount of restructuring/bankruptcy expenses, the size and priority of unfunded pension obligations, litigation or other
contingent claims, the treatment of intercompany claims and the likely outcome with respect to inter-creditor conflicts.
for
structured fixed maturity securities (primarily residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities), the company estimates the present value of the
security by projecting future cash flows of the assets underlying the securitization, allocating the flows to the various tranches based on the structure of the securitization, and determining the
present value of the cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a
result of a previous impairment or changes in expected cash flows). the company incorporates levels of delinquencies, defaults and severities as well as credit attributes of the remaining assets in
the securitization, along with other economic data, to arrive at its best estimate of the parameters applied to the assets underlying the securitization. in order to project cash flows, the following
assumptions are applied to the assets underlying the securitization: (1)voluntary prepayment rates, (2)default rates and (3)loss severity. the key assumptions made for the
prime, alt-a and first-lien sub-prime mortgage-backed securities at december31, 2012 were as follows:
(at december31, 2012)
prime
alt-a
sub-prime
voluntary prepayment rates
2% - 35%
0% - 16%
1% - 10%
percentage of remaining pool liquidated due to defaults
2% - 63%
13% - 70%
24% - 80%
loss severity
25% - 65%
40% - 73%
65% - 92%
real
estate investments
on
at least an annual basis, the company obtains independent appraisals for substantially all of its real estate investments. in addition, the carrying value
of all real estate investments is reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. the review for
impairment considers the valuation from the independent appraisal, when applicable, and incorporates an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the real estate property. an impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the real estate property. the impairment loss is the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value.

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
other
investments
investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships
included in other investments are private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships that generally report
investments on their balance sheet at fair value and are accounted for by the company using the equity method of accounting. the company reviews these investments for impairment no less frequently
than quarterly and monitors the performance throughout the year through discussions with the managers/general partners. if the company becomes aware of an impairment of a partnership's investments at
the balance sheet date prior to receiving the partnership's financial statements, it will recognize an impairment by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the partnership with a corresponding
charge to net investment income.
mortgage loans
a mortgage loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect principal and interest amounts
due. for mortgage loans that are determined to be impaired, a reserve is established for the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the underlying collateral. in estimating fair
value, the company uses interest rates reflecting the current real estate financing market returns.
changes
in intent to sell temporarily impaired assets
the
company may, from time to time, sell invested assets subsequent to the balance sheet date that it did not intend to sell at the balance sheet date.
conversely, the company may not sell invested assets that it asserted that it intended to sell at the balance sheet date. such changes in intent are generally due to events occurring subsequent to the
balance sheet date. the types of events that may result in a change in intent include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances related to the invested asset
(e.g.,a downgrade or upgrade from a rating agency), significant unforeseen changes in liquidity needs, or changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment.
securities lending
the company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its
investments to other institutions for short periods of time. borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest.
this collateral is held by a third-party custodian, and the company has the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution borrowing the company's securities is in default under
the lending agreement. therefore, the company does not recognize the receipt of the collateral held by the third-party custodian or the obligation to return the collateral. the loaned securities
remain a recorded asset of the company. the company accepts only cash as collateral for securities on loan and restricts the manner in which that cash is invested.
reinsurance recoverables
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. the company reports its
reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. the allowance is based upon the company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection
periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes,

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
applicable
coverage defenses and other relevant factors. amounts deemed to be uncollectible, including amounts due from known insolvent reinsurers, are written off against the allowance for estimated
uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. any subsequent collections of amounts previously written off are reported as part of claims and claim adjustment expenses. the company evaluates and monitors
the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies.
deferred acquisition costs
incremental direct costs of acquired new and renewal insurance contracts, consisting of commissions and premium-related taxes, are
capitalized and charged to expense pro rata over the contract periods in which the related premiums are earned. deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future
income and, if not, are charged to expense. future investment income attributable to related premiums is taken into account in measuring the recoverability of the carrying value of this asset. all
other acquisition expenses are charged to operations as incurred.
contractholder receivables and payables
under certain workers' compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, the company is obligated to pay the claimant for the
full amount of the claim. the company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. these amounts are included on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet in
contractholder payables and contractholder receivables, respectively.
goodwill and other intangible assets
the company performs a review, on at least an annual basis, of goodwill held by the reporting units which are the company's three
operating and reportable segments: business insurance; financial, professional& international insurance; and personal insurance. the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and
compares it to their carrying value, including goodwill. if the carrying values of the reporting units were to exceed their fair value, the amount of the impairment would be calculated and goodwill
adjusted accordingly.
the
company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. the discounted cash flow model is an income approach to valuation that is based on a
detailed cash flow analysis for deriving a current fair value of reporting units and is representative of the company's reporting units' current and expected future financial performance. the discount
rate assumptions reflected the company's assessment of the risks inherent in the projected future cash flows and the
company's weighted-average cost of capital, and were compared against available market data for reasonableness.
other
indefinite-lived intangible assets held by the company are also reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis. the classification of the asset as indefinite-lived is
reassessed and an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
intangible
assets that are deemed to have a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives. the carrying amount of intangible assets with a finite useful life is regularly
reviewed for indicators of

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
impairment
in value. impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the
carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
as
a result of the reviews performed for the years ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the company determined that the estimated fair value significantly exceeded the
respective carrying value of its reporting units for those years and that goodwill was not impaired. the company also determined during its reviews for each year that its other indefinite-lived
intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent estimates for the ultimate cost of unpaid reported and unreported claims
incurred and related expenses. the reserves are adjusted regularly based upon experience. included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in the consolidated balance sheet are certain
reserves discounted to the present value of estimated future payments. the liabilities for losses for most long-term disability and annuity claim payments, primarily arising from workers'
compensation insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies, were discounted using a rate of 5% at both december31, 2012 and 2011. these discounted reserves totaled
$2.01billion and $2.20billion at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
the
company performs a continuing review of its claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, including its reserving techniques and its reinsurance. the reserves are also reviewed
regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company. since the reserves are based on estimates, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such reserves. the effects of changes in such
estimated reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. such changes in estimates could occur in a future period and may be material to the
company's results of operations and financial position in such period.
other liabilities
included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet is the company's estimate of its liability for guaranty fund and other
insurance-related assessments. the liability for expected state guaranty fund and other premium-based assessments is recognized as the company writes or becomes obligated to write or renew the
premiums on which the assessments are expected to be based. the liability for loss-based assessments is recognized as the related losses are incurred. at december31, 2012 and 2011,
the company had a liability of $297million and $293million, respectively, for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments and related recoverables of $15million and
$19million, respectively. the liability for such assessments and the related recoverables are not discounted for the time value of money. the loss-based assessments are expected to
be paid over a period ranging from one year to the life expectancy of certain workers' compensation claimants and the recoveries are expected to occur over the same period of time.
also
included in other liabilities is an accrual for policyholder dividends. certain insurance contracts, primarily workers' compensation, are participating whereby dividends are paid to
policyholders in accordance with contract provisions. net written premiums for participating dividend policies were approximately 2% of total net written premiums for the year ended
december31, 2012, and approximately 1% of total net written premiums for each of the years ended december31, 2011

and
2010, respectively. policyholder dividends are accrued against earnings using best available estimates of amounts to be paid. the liability accrued for policyholder dividends totaled
$59million and $54million at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
treasury stock
the cost of common stock repurchased by the company is reported as treasury stock and represents authorized and unissued shares of the
company under the minnesota business corporation act.
statutory accounting practices
the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the state of connecticut, prepare statutory financial statements in
accordance with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance departments of the states of domicile. prescribed statutory accounting practices are those practices that are
incorporated directly or by reference in state laws, regulations, and general administrative rules applicable to all insurance enterprises domiciled in a particular state. permitted statutory
accounting practices include practices not prescribed by the domiciliary state, but allowed by the domiciliary state regulatory authority. the impact of any permitted accounting practices on
policyholders' surplus of the company is not material.
the
company's non-u.s. insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with the regulatory reporting requirements of their respective local
jurisdiction.
premiums and unearned premium reserves
premiums are recognized as revenues pro rata over the policy period. unearned premium reserves represent the unexpired portion of
policy premiums. accrued retrospective premiums are included in premium balances receivable. premium balances receivable are reported net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible premium amounts.
ceded
premiums are charged to income over the applicable term of the various reinsurance contracts with third party reinsurers. prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired
portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as part of other assets.
fee income
fee income includes servicing fees from carriers and revenues from large deductible policies and service contracts and is recognized
pro rata over the contract or policy periods.
other revenues
other revenues include revenues from premium installment charges, which are recognized as collected, revenues of noninsurance
subsidiaries other than fee income and gains and losses on dispositions of assets and redemption of debt, and other miscellaneous revenues.

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
income taxes
the company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax effects attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. the effect of a change in tax laws or rates
on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not
that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
foreign currency translation
the company assigns functional currencies to its foreign operations, which are generally the currencies of the local operating
environment. foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the functional currency, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in earnings. functional currency amounts are then
translated into u.s. dollars. the foreign currency remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for items reported in the balance sheets and average exchange rates for
items recorded in earnings. the change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year, net of tax, is a component of other comprehensive income.
share-based compensation
the company has an employee stock incentive compensation plan that permits grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock, stock units, performance awards and other stock-based or stock-denominated awards with respect to the company's common stock.
compensation
cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of an award, utilizing the assumptions discussed in note13. compensation cost is recognized for
financial reporting purposes over the period in which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). in connection with certain share-based
awards, participants are entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, either in cash or dividend equivalent shares, commensurate with the dividends paid to common shareholders. dividends
and dividend equivalent shares on awards that are expected to vest are recorded in retained earnings. dividends paid on awards that are not expected to vest as part of the company's forfeiture
estimate are recorded as compensation expense.
nature of operations
the company is organized into three reportable business segments: business insurance; financial, professional& international
insurance; and personal insurance. these
segments reflect the manner in which the company's businesses are currently managed and represent an aggregation of products and services based on type of customer, how the business is marketed and
the manner in which risks are underwritten.

the accounting policies used to prepare the segment reporting data for the company's three reportable business segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies in note1.
except
as described below for certain legal entities, the company allocates its invested assets and the related net investment income to its reportable business segments. pretax net
investment income is allocated based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each
segment. for investable funds, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the estimated duration of the loss reserves' future cash flows, the interest rate environment at the time the
losses were incurred and a+ rated corporate debt instrument yields. for capital, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the average yield on the total investment portfolio. the
benchmark investment yields are applied to each segment's investable funds and capital, respectively, to produce a total notional investment income by segment. the company's actual net investment
income is allocated to each segment in proportion to the respective segment's notional investment income to total notional investment income. there are certain legal entities within the company that
are dedicated to specific reportable business segments. the invested assets and related net investment income from these legal entities are reported in the applicable business segment and are not
allocated among the other business segments.
the
cost of the company's catastrophe treaty program is included in the company's ceded premiums and is allocated among reportable business segments based on an estimate of actual market
reinsurance pricing using expected losses calculated by the company's catastrophe model, adjusted for any experience adjustments.

real estate
the company's real estate investments include warehouses, office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly
owned. the company negotiates commercial leases with individual tenants through unrelated, licensed real estate brokers. negotiated terms and conditions include, among others, rental rates, length of
lease period and improvements to the premises to be provided by the landlord.
proceeds
from the sale of real estate investments were $53million in 2012. gross gains of $19million were realized on those sales and there were no gross losses. in 2011,
there were no sales of real estate investments. proceeds from the sale of real estate investments in 2010 were $10million. gross gains of $3million were realized on those sales and
there were no gross losses. the company had no real estate held for sale at december31, 2012 and 2011. accumulated depreciation on real estate held for investment purposes was
$255million and $237million at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
future
minimum rental income on operating leases relating to the company's real estate properties is expected to be $76million, $69million, $59million,
$43million and $29million for 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, and $49million for 2018 and thereafter.
short-term securities
the company's short-term securities consist of aaa-rated registered money market funds, u.s.treasury
securities, high-quality commercial paper (primarily a1/p1) and high-quality
corporate securities purchased within a year to their maturity with a combined average of 77days to maturity at december31, 2012. the amortized cost of these securities, which totaled
$3.48billion and $3.59billion at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, approximated their fair value.
variable interest entities
entities which do not have sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support
or in which the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of a controlling financial interest are referred to as variable interest entities (vie). avie is consolidated by
the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest (primary beneficiary) as a result of having both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most
significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. the company
determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of an entity subject to consolidation based on a qualitative assessment of the vie's capital structure, contractual terms, nature of the vie's
operations and purpose and the company's relative exposure to the related risks of the vie on the date it becomes initially involved in the vie. the company reassesses its vie determination with
respect to an entity on an ongoing basis.
the
company is a passive investor in limited partner equity interests issued by third party vies. these include certain of the company's investments in private equity limited
partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships where the company is not related to the general partner. these investments are generally accounted for under the equity method and reported in
the company's consolidated balance sheet as other investments unless the company is deemed the primary beneficiary.
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
3. investments (continued)
these
equity interests generally cannot be redeemed. distributions from these investments are received by the company as a result of liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds and/or as
income distribution. the company's maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the company's consolidated balance sheet and any
unfunded commitment. neither the carrying amounts nor the unfunded commitments related to these vies are material.
unrealized investment losses
the following tables summarize, for all investments in an unrealized loss position at december31, 2012 and 2011, the aggregate
fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time those securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position. the fair value amounts reported in the tables are estimates that are
prepared using the process described in note4. the company also relies upon estimates of several factors in its review and evaluation of individual investments, using the process described in
note1, in determining whether such investments are other-than-temporarily impaired.

concentrations and credit quality
concentrations of credit risk arise from exposure to counterparties that are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic
characteristics that could cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. the company seeks to mitigate credit risk by
actively monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties, obtaining collateral as deemed appropriate, and applying controls that include credit approvals, limits of credit exposure, and other
monitoring procedures.
at
december31, 2012 and 2011, other than u.s. treasury securities and obligations of u.s. government and government agencies and authorities, the company was not exposed to any
concentration of credit risk of a single issuer greater than 5% of shareholders' equity of the company.
included
in fixed maturities are below investment grade assets totaling $2.05billion and $1.96billion at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the company
defines its below investment grade assets as those securities rated below investment grade by external rating agencies, or the equivalent by the company when a public rating does not exist. such
assets include publicly traded below investment grade bonds and certain other privately issued bonds that are classified as below investment grade loans.

derivative financial instruments
the company uses u.s. treasury note futures transactions to modify the effective duration of specific assets within the investment
portfolio and enters into 90-day futures contracts on 2-year, 5-year, 10-year and 30-year u.s. treasury notes which require a daily
mark-to-market and settlement with the broker. the notional value of the open u.s. treasury futures contracts was $800million and $900million at
december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. net realized investment gains in 2012, 2011 and 2010 included net losses of $14million, $62million and $30million,
respectively, related to u.s. treasury futures contracts.
in
2010, the company recorded a net realized investment gain of $5million related to its holdings of six million stock purchase warrants of platinum underwriters
holdings,ltd., a publicly-held company. these warrants were not designated and did not qualify for hedge accounting, and, as such, the mark-to-market
changes in fair value were reflected in net realized investment gains. in october 2010, the company sold these stock purchase warrants for proceeds that approximated their carrying value at the date
of sale.
the
company purchases investments that have embedded derivatives, primarily convertible debt securities. these embedded derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in value
reflected in net realized investment gains. derivatives embedded in convertible debt securities are reported on a combined basis with their host instrument and are classified as fixed maturity
securities. the company recorded net realized investment losses of less than $1million in 2012, and $2million and $1million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to these
embedded derivatives.
4. fair value measurements
the company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. the framework is based
on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. the disclosure of fair
value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
4. fair value measurements (continued)
are
observable. in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs that reflect the company's significant market assumptions. the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:
level1unadjusted quoted market prices for identical
assets or liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability to access.
level2quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g.,interest
rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.
level3valuations based on models where significant
inputs are not observable. the unobservable inputs reflect the company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use.
valuation of investments reported at fair value in financial statements
the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction
between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e.,not in a forced transaction. the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the
security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g.,a forced transaction. additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based
inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.
for
investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in
level1 of the hierarchy. the company receives the quoted market prices from a third party, nationally recognized pricing service (pricing service). when quoted market prices are unavailable,
the company utilizes a pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value, which is mainly used for its fixed maturity investments. the fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are
included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. if quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the company produces an estimate of fair value
based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as level2 or level3. the company
bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction.
fixed maturities
the company utilizes a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities. the pricing
service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. since fixed maturities other than u.s. treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily
basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which include available
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
4. fair value measurements (continued)
relevant
market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. additionally, the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop
prepayment and interest rate scenarios.
the
pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. the market inputs utilized
in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark
securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. the extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions. depending on the security,
the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. for some securities, additional inputs may be necessary.
the
pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. if
the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to
make assumptions for market-based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions.
the
fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed
maturities, other than u.s. treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. the estimated fair value of u.s. treasury
securities is included in the amount disclosed in level1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.
the
company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and, accordingly, estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an
internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. the underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the u.s.
treasury curve are the bofa merrill lynch u.s. corporate index and the bofa merrill lynch high yield bb rated index. the company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in
level2, since all significant inputs are market observable.
while
the vast majority of the company's municipal bonds and corporate bonds are included in level2, the company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are
not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. due to the limited
amount of observable market information, the company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in level3. the fair value of the fixed maturities for which the company used
an internal pricing matrix was $102million and $88million at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. additionally, the company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity
investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. for these fixed maturities, the company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). the fair value
of the fixed maturities for which the company received a broker quote was $128million and $162million at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. due to the disclaimers on the
quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the company includes these fair value estimates in level3.

4. fair value measurements (continued)
equitiespublic common and preferred
for public common and preferred stocks, the company receives prices from a nationally recognized pricing service that are based on
observable market transactions and includes these estimates in the amount disclosed in level1. infrequently, current market quotes in active markets are unavailable for certain
non-redeemable preferred stocks held by the company. in these instances, the company receives an estimate of fair value from the pricing service that provides fair value estimates for the
company's fixed maturities. the service utilizes some of the same methodologies to price the non-redeemable preferred stocks as it does for the fixed maturities. the company includes the
fair value estimate for these non-redeemable preferred stocks in the amount disclosed in level2.
other investments
the company holds investments in various publicly-traded securities which are reported in other investments. these investments include
securities in the company's trading portfolio, mutual funds and other small holdings. the $46million and $42million fair value of these investments at december31, 2012 and
2011, respectively, was disclosed in level1. at december31, 2012 and 2011, the company held investments in non-public common and preferred equity securities, with fair
value estimates of $54million and $44million, respectively, reported in other investments, where the fair value estimate is determined either internally or by an external fund manager
based on recent filings, operating results, balance sheet stability, growth and other business and market sector fundamentals. due to the significant unobservable inputs in these valuations, the
company includes the total fair value estimate for all of these investments at december31, 2012 and 2011 in the amount disclosed in level3.
derivatives
at december31, 2012 and 2011, the company held $21million and $22million, respectively, of convertible bonds
containing embedded conversion options that are valued separately from the host bond contract in the amount disclosed in level2fixed maturities.

(2)during
the year ended december31, 2011, approximately $81million of municipal fixed maturity securities were valued using observable market
data which resulted in a transfer out of level3 into level2. in prior periods, these securities were valued internally using unobservable inputs.
the
company had no material assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended december31, 2012 and 2011.
financial instruments disclosed, but not carried, at fair value
the company uses various financial instruments in the normal course of its business. the company's insurance contracts are excluded
from fair value of financial instruments accounting guidance and, therefore, are not included in the amounts discussed below. the following tables present the carrying value and fair value of the
company's financial assets and financial liabilities disclosed, but not carried, at fair value at december31, 2012 and 2011, and the level within the fair value hierarchy at which such assets

commercial paper
the
company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value for approximately 95% and 94% of short-term securities at december31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. a description of the
process and inputs used by the pricing service to estimate fair value is discussed in the "fixed maturities" section above. estimates of fair value for
u.s. treasury securities and money market funds are based on market quotations received from the pricing service and are disclosed in level1 of the hierarchy. the fair value of other
short-term fixed maturity securities is estimated by the pricing service using observable market inputs and is disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. for short-term
securities where an estimate is not obtained from the pricing service, the carrying value approximates fair value and is included in level3 of the hierarchy.
the
company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value for 100% of its debt, including commercial paper, at both december31, 2012 and 2011. the pricing service utilizes
market quotations for debt that have quoted prices in active markets. since fixed maturities other than u.s. treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the fair value estimates are
based on market observable inputs and disclosed at level2 in the hierarchy. for the small amount of the company's
table of contents

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
4. fair value measurements (continued)
debt
securities for which a pricing service is not used, the company utilizes pricing estimates from a nationally recognized broker/dealer to estimate fair value. if estimates of fair value are
unavailable from the pricing service or the broker/dealer, the company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques which are based on a discounted cash flow
methodology and incorporates all available relevant observable market inputs. estimates of fair value developed internally and from broker quotes are disclosed in level3 of the hierarchy.
5. reinsurance
the company's consolidated financial statements reflect the effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions. assumed reinsurance refers to the acceptance of certain insurance risks
that other
insurance companies have underwritten. ceded reinsurance involves transferring certain insurance risks (along with the related written and earned premiums) the company has underwritten to other
insurance companies who agree to share these risks. the primary purpose of ceded reinsurance is to protect the company, at a cost, from losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept.
reinsurance is placed on both a quota-share and excess-of-loss basis. ceded reinsurance arrangements do not discharge the company as the primary insurer, except for instances
where the primary policy or policies have been novated.
the
company utilizes general catastrophe reinsurance treaties with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage its exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes. in addition to the coverage
provided under these treaties, the company also utilizes a catastrophe bond program and a northeast catastrophe reinsurance treaty to protect against losses resulting from catastrophes in the
northeastern united states. the company also utilizes an excess-of-loss treaty in its national property business unit of the business insurance segment to protect against
earthquake losses up to a certain threshold.
the
company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
insolvencies. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the company may become involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and
arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. the company employs dedicated specialists and strategies
to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.
included
in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to involuntary reinsurance arrangements. the company is required to participate in various involuntary reinsurance arrangements
through assumed reinsurance, principally with regard to residual market mechanisms in workers' compensation and automobile insurance, as well as homeowners' insurance in certain coastal areas. in
addition, the company provides services for several of these involuntary arrangements ("mandatory pools and associations") under which it writes such residual market business directly, then cedes 100%
of this business to the mandatory pool. such participations and servicing arrangements are arranged to mitigate credit risk to the company, as any ceded balances are jointly backed by all the pool
members.
also
included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements. structured settlements are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle
certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured
settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables as the company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity
payments, the company would be required to make such payments if and to the extent not paid by state guaranty associations.

terrorism risk insurance program
the terrorism risk insurance program (the program) is a federal program administered by the department of the treasury that provides
for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism or war committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest. the program has been
authorized through 2014.
in
order for a loss to be covered under the program (subject losses), the loss must meet certain aggregate industry loss minimums and must be the result of an event that is certified as
an act of terrorism by the u.s. secretary of the treasury, in concurrence with the secretary of state and the attorney general of the united states. the annual aggregate industry loss minimum is
$100million
table of contents

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
5. reinsurance (continued)
through
2014. the program excludes from participation the following types of insurance: federal crop insurance, private mortgage insurance, financial guaranty insurance, medical malpractice insurance,
health or life insurance, flood insurance, reinsurance, commercial automobile, professional liability (other than directors and officers'), surety, burglary and theft, and farm-owners
multi-peril. in the case of a war declared by congress, only workers' compensation losses are covered by the program. all commercial property and casualty insurers licensed in the united states are
generally required to participate in the program. under the program, a participating insurer is entitled to be reimbursed by the federal government for 85% of subject losses, after an insurer
deductible, subject to an annual cap.
the
deductible for any calendar year is equal to 20% of the insurer's direct earned premiums for covered lines for the preceding calendar year. the company's estimated deductible under
the program is $2.26billion for 2013. the annual cap limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100billion. once subject losses have reached the
$100billion aggregate during a program year, participating insurers will not be liable under the program for additional covered terrorism losses for that program year. the company has had no
terrorism-related losses since the program was established. since the law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to specific circumstances. it is also possible that
future legislative action could change the program. further, given the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism losses, as well as the limited terrorism coverage in the company's own
reinsurance program, future losses from acts of terrorism, particularly involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could be material to the company's operating results, financial
position and/or liquidity in future periods. while the company seeks to manage its exposure to man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means, there can be no assurance that the
company would have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or more man-made catastrophic events involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological means.

(1)certain
intangible assets related to renewal rights became fully amortized during the first quarter of 2012.
(2)the
fair value adjustment of $191million was recorded in connection with the merger of the st.paul companies,inc. and travelers
property casualty corp. in 2004 and was based on management's estimate of nominal claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. the method used calculated a risk
adjustment to a risk-free discounted reserve that would, if reserves ran off as expected, produce results that yielded the assumed cost-of-capital on the capital
supporting the loss reserves. the fair value adjustment is reported as an other intangible asset on the consolidated balance sheet, and the amounts measured in accordance with the acquirer's
accounting policies for insurance contracts have been reported as part of the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. the intangible asset is being recognized into
income over the expected payment pattern. because the time value of money and the risk adjustment (cost of capital) components of the intangible asset run off at different rates, the amount recognized
in income may be a net benefit in some periods and a net expense in other periods.

line for accident years 2010 and prior (excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves discussed below), which reflected what the company believes are more favorable legal and judicial
environments than what the company previously expected; the commercial property product line primarily for accident years 2009 through 2011, driven by higher than expected subrogation and salvage
recoveries and by favorable loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in 2011; and the workers' compensation product line, primarily driven by better than expected frequency and severity
related to lifetime medical claims for accident years 2008 and prior. lower than expected claim department expenses also contributed to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012. these
factors were partially offset by $167million and $90million increases to asbestos and environmental reserves, respectively, which are discussed in further detail in the "asbestos and
environmental reserves" section below, net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the commercial automobile line of business, driven by higher than expected severity in the bodily injury

favorable legal and judicial environments than what the company previously expected, as well as net favorable prior year reserve development in the commercial property product line that reflected
better than expected loss development for the 2008 and 2009 accident years. the workers' compensation line of business also contributed slightly to net favorable prior year reserve development in
2011, as favorable loss development for accident years 2003 through 2009 was largely offset by net unfavorable loss development for the 2010 accident year. these factors were partially offset by
$175million and $76million increases to asbestos and environmental reserves in 2011, respectively (discussed in further detail in the "asbestos and environmental reserves" section
below), unfavorable prior year reserve development in the commercial multi-peril product line driven by late reporting of hail claims incurred in 2010 and unfavorable prior year reserve development in

resulted primarily from favorable resolutions of claims and disputes from accident years 2002 and prior. in addition, better than expected loss development in the business insurance
segment in recent years resulted in a favorable re-estimation of reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses in 2010. the net favorable prior year reserve development in these
product lines in 2010 was partially offset by $140million and $35million increases to asbestos and environmental reserves, respectively.
financial, professional& international insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development totaled $259million in
2010. in
bond& financial products, net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 was driven by better than expected loss development in the surety and management liability lines
of business due to lower than expected claim activity and loss severity in the 2008 and prior accident years. in international, the majority of net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010
occurred at the company's operation at lloyd's, in canada and in the united kingdom.
personal insurance.net favorable prior year reserve development of $87million in 2010 was concentrated in the homeowners and

asbestos and environmental reserves
at december31, 2012 and 2011, the company's claims and claim adjustment expense reserves included $2.73billion and
$2.78billion, respectively, for asbestos and environmental-related claims, net of reinsurance.
it
is difficult to estimate the reserves for asbestos and environmental-related claims due to the vagaries of court coverage decisions, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, the
risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, including, without limitation, those which are set forth below.
asbestos reserves.because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the company generally reviews the
exposure presented
by each policyholder at least annually. among the factors which the company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess
insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim
activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of
non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to
whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.
in
the third quarter of 2012, the company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review. as in prior years, the annual claim review considered active policyholders and
litigation cases
for potential product and "non-product" liability. the company noted the following trends:
continued high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious
asbestos-related illness;
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
7. insurance claim reserves (continued)
while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain
policyholders due to the continued high level of litigation activity;
continued moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity; and
the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants.
while
the company believes that over the past several years there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the company's overall asbestos exposure, there nonetheless
remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims.
during
2012, total gross and net asbestos-related payments decreased when compared with 2011, primarily resulting from a decline in both gross and net payments to policyholders with whom
the company has entered into settlement agreements. the home office and field office categories, which account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, experienced a
modest reduction in gross asbestos-related payments during 2012 when compared with 2011, while net asbestos payments were flat. payments on behalf of policyholders in these categories continue to be
influenced by the high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury continue to target previously peripheral defendants.
the number of policyholders tendering asbestos claims for the first time in 2012 and the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims both increased slightly when compared with 2011.
the
company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder
bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. the company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office, field office and assumed reinsurance and other
categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. in addition, the company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience,
year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to
establish asbestos reserves nor have the company's evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.
the
completion of these reviews and analyses in 2012, 2011 and 2010 resulted in $175million, $175million and $140million increases, respectively, in the company's
net asbestos reserves in each period. in each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad
number of policyholders in the
home office category and by higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance accounts. the increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue
to be moderately higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above. the increase in 2010 also reflected increases in costs of litigating
asbestos-related coverage matters and was partially offset by a $70million benefit from the reduction in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance resulting from a favorable ruling related
to a reinsurance dispute. notwithstanding these trends, the company's overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree
of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.
net
asbestos losses paid in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $236million, $284million and $350million, respectively. approximately 6%, 19% and 32% of total net paid
losses in 2012, 2011 and 2010,

respectively,
related to policyholders with whom the company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the company's liability.
environmental reserves.in establishing environmental reserves, the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and
the anticipated
cost of resolution, if any. in the course of this analysis, the company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of
similar exposures. in addition, the company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total
number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each
site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the
company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of
non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. the evaluation of the exposure presented
by a policyholder can change as information concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves.
the
company has received and continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980's.
these policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory
agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies.
overall net environmental claim payments in 2012 were essentially unchanged from 2011. over the past several years, the company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new
policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. the degree to which those favorable trends
have continued, however, has been less than anticipated. as a result, in 2012 and 2011, the company increased its net environmental reserves by $90million and $76million, respectively.
in 2010, the company increased its net environmental reserves by $35million due to a modest upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending
policyholders.
asbestos and environmental reserves.as a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves
carried for
asbestos and environmental claims at december31, 2012 are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. however, the uncertainties surrounding the
final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject
to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation,
any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and
environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of
available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome
table of contents

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
7. insurance claim reserves (continued)
of
direct actions against the company, future developments pertaining to the company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance
sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. in addition, uncertainties arise from the
insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future
development of asbestos and environmental claims. this environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the
outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex
coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case
with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. as part of its continuing analysis of
asbestos and environmental reserves, the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the company's current reserves. in addition, the company's estimate of claims and
claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that
could be material to the company's operating results in future periods.
catastrophe exposure
the company has geographic exposure to catastrophe losses, which can be caused by a variety of events, including, among others,
hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. catastrophes can also result from a terrorist attack
(including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), explosions, infrastructure failures or as a consequence of political instability. the incidence and severity of
catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the
event. most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. the
company generally seeks to mitigate its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance.
there
are also risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of the
company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information
available to establish the reserves. complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution
exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage and business income interruption costs; and reinsurance
collectibility. the timing of a catastrophe's occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to us in estimating reserves for that reporting
period. the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.

discussion that follows). interest rates on commercial paper issued in 2012 ranged from 0.1% to 0.2%, and in 2011 ranged from 0.1% to 0.3%.
senior notesthe company's various senior debt issues are unsecured obligations that rank equally with one another. interest payments are made
semi-annually. the company generally may redeem some or all of the notes prior to maturity in accordance with terms unique to each debt instrument.
junior subordinated debenturesthe company's $107million remaining aggregate principal amount of 6.25%
fixed-to-floating rate debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 6.25% from the date of issuance to, but excluding, march15, 2017, payable semi-annually
in arrears on march15 and september15. from and including march15, 2017, the debentures will bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month libor plus 2.215%, payable
quarterly on march15, june15, september15 and december15 of each year. the company can redeem the debentures at its option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after
march15, 2017 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest. the company can redeem the debentures at its option prior to
march15, 2017 (a)in whole at any time or in part from time to time or (b)in whole, but not in part, in the event of certain tax or rating agency events relating to the
debentures, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed and the applicable make-whole amount, in each case plus any accrued and unpaid
interest.
the
company has the right, on one or more occasions, to defer the payment of interest on the debentures. the company will not be required to settle deferred interest until it has
deferred interest for five consecutive years or, if earlier, made a payment of current interest during a deferral period. the company may defer interest for up to ten consecutive years without giving
rise to an event of default. deferred interest will accumulate additional interest at an annual rate equal to the annual interest rate then applicable to the debentures.
the
debentures have a final maturity date of march15, 2067 and a scheduled maturity date of march15, 2037. the company can redeem the debentures at its option any time
(as described above) using any source of funds, including cash. if the company chooses not to redeem the debentures, then during the 180-day period ending not more than 15 and not less
than ten business days prior to the scheduled maturity date, the company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell enough qualifying capital securities to permit repayment of the
debentures at the scheduled maturity date. if any debentures remain outstanding after the scheduled maturity date, unless and until the company redeems the debentures (as described above) using any
source of funds, including cash, the company shall be required to use its commercially reasonable efforts on a quarterly basis to raise sufficient proceeds from the sale of qualifying capital
securities to permit the repayment in full of the debentures. if there are remaining debentures at the final maturity date, the company is required to redeem the debentures using any source of funds.
qualifying capital securities are securities (other than common stock, qualifying warrants, mandatorily convertible preferred stock, debt exchangeable for common equity, and debt exchangeable for
preferred equity) which generally are treated by the ratings agencies as having similar equity content to the debentures.

institutions that expires in june 2013. pursuant to the credit agreement covenants, the company must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth (generally defined as shareholders' equity plus certain
trust preferred and mandatorily convertible securities, reduced for goodwill and other intangible assets) of $14.35billion. the company must also maintain a ratio of total debt to the sum of
total debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than 0.40 to 1.00. in addition, the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of
default, including with respect to a change in control, which is defined to include
the acquisition of 35% or more of the company's voting stock and certain changes in the composition of the company's board of directors. at december31, 2012, the company was in compliance with
these covenants. generally, the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from libor plus 100 basis points to libor plus 175 basis points depending on the company's credit ratings. at
december31, 2012, that cost would have been libor plus 125 basis points had there been any amounts outstanding under the credit agreement. this line of credit also supports the company's
commercial paper program.

9. shareholders' equity and dividend availability (continued)
preferred stock
the company's preferred shareholders' equity at december31, 2010 represented the par value of preferred shares outstanding
related to a legacy stock ownership plan (sop) trust which was subsequently merged into the travelers 401(k) savings plan (the savings plan). the sop trust could at any time convert any or all of the
preferred shares into shares of the company's common stock at a rate of eight shares of common stock for each preferred share. in may 2011, the company's board of directors authorized the redemption
of the company's preferred stock held by the savings plan and gave notice of that redemption to the appropriate fiduciaries of the savings plan. following a fiduciary review, the savings plan
exercised its right to convert each preferred share into eight shares of the company's common stock. as a result, all preferred shares outstanding on june7, 2011 (190,083 shares) were
converted into a total of 1.52million shares of the company's common stock.
dividend availability
the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the state of connecticut, are subject to various regulatory
restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid by each insurance subsidiary to its respective parent company without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. a
maximum of $2.05billion is available by the end of 2013 for such dividends without prior approval of the connecticut insurance department. the company may choose to accelerate the timing
within 2013 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2013, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the connecticut insurance department.
the
holding company is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. the undistributed earnings of the company's
foreign operations are not material and are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations.
the
holding company received $1.96billion of dividends in 2012, all of which was received from its u.s. insurance subsidiaries.
statutory net income and policyholder surplus
statutory net income of the company's domestic and international insurance subsidiaries was $2.84billion, $1.50billion
and $3.69billion for the years ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. policyholder surplus of the company's domestic and international insurance subsidiaries was
$20.05billion and $19.17billion at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

if
the company determines that any of its deferred tax assets will not result in future tax benefits, a valuation allowance must be established for the portion of these assets that are
not expected to be
realized. based upon a review of the company's anticipated future taxable income, and also including all other available evidence, both positive and negative, the company's management concluded that
it is more likely than not that the gross deferred tax assets will be realized.
for
tax return purposes, as of december31, 2012, the company had net operating loss (nol) carryforwards on a regular tax basis and an alternative minimum tax (amt) basis of
approximately $37million and $3million, respectively. these nol carryforwards expire, if unused, in 2018. in addition, the company has amt credit carryforwards of $17million
which are available to reduce future federal regular income taxes over an indefinite period. the amount and timing of realizing the benefits of nol and amt credit carryforwards depend on future
taxable income and limitations imposed by tax laws. the benefits of the nol and amt credit carryforwards have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are included in net deferred
tax assets.
u.s.
income taxes have not been recognized on $755million of the company's foreign operations' undistributed earnings as of december31, 2012, as such earnings are
intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations. furthermore, any taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits against the u.s. tax on any dividend
distributions from such earnings.

certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of deductibility. the timing of such deductibility would not affect the annual effective tax rate.
the
company recognizes accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes. during the years ended december31, 2012 and 2011, the company
recognized approximately $46million and $(122)million in interest, respectively. the company had approximately $94million and $48million accrued for the payment of
interest at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
the
irs is conducting an examination of the company's u.s. income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. the company does not expect any significant changes to its liability for unrecognized tax
benefits during the next twelve months.
13. share-based incentive compensation
the company has a share-based incentive compensation plan, the travelers companies,inc. amended and restated 2004 stock incentive plan (the 2004 incentive plan), which replaced
prior share-based incentive compensation plans (legacy plans). the purposes of the 2004 incentive plan are to align the interests of the company's non-employee directors, executive
officers and other
employees with those of the company's shareholders, and to attract and retain personnel by providing incentives in the form of stock-based awards. the 2004 incentive plan permits grants of
nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock, deferred stock units, performance awards and other stock-based
or stock-denominated awards with respect to the company's common stock. the number of shares of the company's common stock authorized for grant under the 2004 incentive plan is 35million
shares, subject to additional shares that may be available for awards as described below. the company has a policy of issuing new shares to settle the exercise of stock option awards and the vesting
of other equity awards.
in
connection with the adoption of the 2004 incentive plan, legacy share-based incentive compensation plans were terminated. outstanding grants were not affected by the termination of
these legacy plans, including the grant of reload options related to prior option grants under the legacy plans. as of december31, 2012, there were no longer any options eligible for reload.
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
13. share-based incentive compensation (continued)
the 2004 incentive plan is the only plan pursuant to which future stock-based awards may be granted. in addition to the 35million shares initially authorized for issuance under
the 2004 incentive plan, the following will not be counted towards the 35million shares available and will be available for future grants under the 2004 incentive plan: (i)shares of
common stock subject to an award that expires unexercised, that is forfeited, terminated or canceled, that is settled in cash or other forms of property,
or otherwise does not result in the issuance of shares of common stock, in whole or in part; (ii)shares that are used to pay the exercise price of stock options and shares used to pay
withholding taxes on awards generally; and (iii)shares purchased by the company on the open market using cash option exercise proceeds; provided, however, that the increase in the number of
shares of common stock available for grant pursuant to such market purchases shall not be greater than the number that could be repurchased at fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock
option giving rise to such option proceeds. these provisions also apply to awards granted under the legacy share-based incentive compensation plans that were outstanding on the effective date of the
2004 incentive plan.
the
company also has a compensation program for non-employee directors (the director compensation program). under the director compensation program, non-employee
directors' compensation consists of an annual retainer, a deferred stock award, committee chair fees and a lead director fee. each non-employee director may choose to receive all or a
portion of his or her annual retainer in the form of cash or deferred stock units which vest upon grant. the annual deferred stock awards vest in full one day prior to the date of the company's annual
meeting of shareholders occurring in the year following the year of the grant date, subject to continued service. any of the deferred stock awards may accumulate, including reinvestment dividends,
until distribution either in a lump sum six months after termination of service as a director or, if the director so elects, in annual installments beginning at least six months following termination
of service as a director. the shares of deferred stock units issued under the director compensation program are awarded under the 2004 incentive plan.
stock option awards
stock option awards granted to eligible officers and key employees have a ten-year term. prior to january1, 2007,
stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the company's common stock on the day preceding the date of grant. beginning january1, 2007, all stock
options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant. the stock options granted generally vest upon meeting certain years of service
criteria. except as the compensation committee of the board may allow in the future, stock options cannot be sold or transferred by the participant. the stock options granted under the 2004 incentive
plan vest three years after grant date (cliff vest).
in
addition to the stock option awards described above, certain stock option awards that were granted under legacy plans permitted an employee exercising an option to be granted a new
option (a reload option) at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date on which the original option was exercised. the reload option was permitted on
certain stock option awards granted prior to january 2003 at an amount equal to the number of shares of the common stock used to satisfy both the exercise price and withholding taxes due upon exercise
of an option and vest either six months or one year after the grant date and are exercisable for the remaining term of the related original option. at december31, 2012, there were no longer
any options eligible for reload.
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
13. share-based incentive compensation (continued)
the
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant by application of a variation of the black-scholes option pricing model using the assumptions noted in the following
table. the expected term of newly granted stock options is the time to vest plus half the remaining time to expiration. this considers the vesting restriction and represents an even pattern of
exercise behavior over the remaining term. reload options were exercisable for the remaining term of the original option and therefore generally had a shorter expected term. beginning in april 2010,
due to the company having attained sufficient history with respect to changes in its stock prices over time, the expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the company's
common stock for the same period as the estimated option term based on the mid-month of the option grant. prior to april 2010, the expected volatility was based on the average historical
volatility of the common stock of an industry peer group of entities due to the limited company stock history. the expected dividend is based upon the company's current quarter dividend annualized and
assumed to be constant over the expected option term. the risk-free interest rate for each option is the interpolated market yield for the mid-month of the option grant on a
u.s. treasury bill with a term comparable to the expected option term of the granted stock option. shares received through option exercises under the reload program were subject to either a
one-year or two-year restriction on sale. a discount, as measured by the estimated cost of protecting against changes in market value - 5% for one-year sales
restrictions and 10% for two-year sales restrictions - had been applied to the fair value of reload options granted to reflect these sales restrictions. the following assumptions were used
in estimating the fair value of options on grant date for the years ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:

restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance share award programs
the company, commencing with equity grants on or after january1, 2007, issues restricted stock unit awards to eligible officers

from the date of grant, do not have voting rights and the underlying shares of common stock are not issued until the vesting criteria is satisfied. in addition, the company's board of directors
can be issued deferred stock unit awards from (i)an annual award; (ii)deferred compensation (in lieu of cash retainer); and (iii)dividend reinvestment shares earned on
outstanding deferred compensation.
the
company also has a performance share awards program pursuant to the 2004 incentive plan which became effective beginning in 2006. under the program, the company may issue performance
share awards to certain employees of the company who hold positions of vice president (or its equivalent) or above. the performance awards provide the recipient the right to earn shares of the
company's common stock based upon the company's attainment of certain performance goals. the performance goals for performance awards are based on the company's adjusted return on equity over a
three-year performance period. vesting of any performance shares is contingent upon the company attaining the relevant performance period minimum threshold return on equity. if the
performance period return on equity is below the minimum threshold, none of the shares will vest. if performance meets or exceeds the minimum performance threshold, a range of performance shares will
vest (50%160% for awards granted prior to and including february 2009; 50%150% for awards granted in february 2010; and 50%130% for awards granted in february
2011, 2012 and 2013); depending on the actual return on equity attained.
the
fair value of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance shares is measured at the market price of the company stock at date of grant.
the
total fair value of shares that vested during the years ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $146million, $121million and $113million,
respectively.

13. share-based incentive compensation (continued)
on
february5, 2013, the company, under the 2004 stock incentive plan, granted 1,268,572 common stock awards in the form of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and
performance share awards to participating officers, non-employee directors and other key employees. the restricted stock units and deferred stock units totaled 713,198shares while
the performance share awards totaled 555,374shares. the fair value per share attributable to the common stock awards on the date of grant was $78.65.
share-based compensation cost recognition
the amount of compensation cost for awards subject to a service condition is based on the number of shares expected to be issued and is
recognized over the time period for which service is to be provided (requisite service period). awards granted to retiree-eligible employees or to employees who become retiree-eligible before an
award's vesting date are considered to have met the requisite service condition. the compensation cost for awards subject to a performance condition is based upon the probable outcome of the
performance condition, which on the grant date reflects an estimate of attaining 100% of the performance shares granted. the compensation cost reflects an estimated annual forfeiture rate from 3.5% to
4% over the requisite service period of the awards. that estimate is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments expected to vest is likely to differ from
previous estimates. compensation costs for awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. for awards that have a graded vesting schedule, the
compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple
awards. the total compensation cost for all share-based incentive compensation awards recognized in earnings for the years ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $120million,
$121million and $128million, respectively. included in these amounts are compensation cost adjustments of $4million, $4million and $10million, for the years
ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, that reflected the cost associated with the updated estimate of performance shares due to attaining certain performance levels from the
date of the initial grant of the performance awards. the related tax benefits recognized in earnings were $42million, $42million and $44million for the years ended
december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
at
december31, 2012, there was $112million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested share-based incentive compensation awards. this includes stock
options, restricted and deferred stock units and performance shares granted under the 2004 incentive plan. the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 1.7years.
cash
received from the exercise of employee stock options under share-based compensation plans totaled $295million and $314million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. the tax
benefit realized for tax deductions from employee stock options exercised during 2012 and 2011 totaled $36million and $30million, respectively.

effective
january1, 2013, the company converted its current prescription drug program for medicare-eligible retirees to a group-based company-sponsored medicare partd
employer group waiver plan (egwp) program. the egwp structure was made financially attractive for companies due to changes stemming from health care reform legislation. under egwp, the federal direct
capitation payments will be paid to the company while the federal reinsurance and pharmaceutical rebates will be used to offset claims. the company estimates that the transition to egwp will lower
prescription drug liabilities by approximately $31million.
the
total accumulated benefit obligation for the company's defined benefit pension plans was $3.21billion and $2.83billion at december31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. the qualified domestic plan
accounted for $3.01billion and $2.65billion of the total accumulated benefit obligation at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, whereas the nonqualified and foreign plans
accounted for $0.20billion and $0.18billion of the total accumulated benefit obligation at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
for
pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, the aggregate projected benefit obligation was $3.25billion and the aggregate accumulated
benefit obligation was $3.20billion at december31, 2012. the fair value of plan assets for the above plans was $2.85billion and $2.49billion at december31, 2012
and 2011, respectively.

the
discount rate assumption used to determine the benefit obligation was based on a yield-curve approach. under this approach, a weighted average yield is determined from a hypothetical
portfolio of high quality fixed maturity corporate bonds (rated aa) available at the year-end valuation date for which the timing and amount of cash outflows correspond with the timing and
amount of the estimated benefit payouts of the company's benefit plan.
in
choosing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company selected the rate that was set as the return objective by the company's benefit plans investment
committee, which had considered the historical returns of equity and fixed maturity markets in conjunction with prevailing economic and financial market conditions.
as
an indicator of sensitivity, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $22million at
december31, 2012, and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense by $1million for the year ended december31, 2012.
decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by
1% would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december31, 2012 by $19million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net
postretirement benefit expense by $1million for the year ended december31, 2012.
plan assets
pension plan assets are invested for the exclusive benefit of the plan participants and beneficiaries and are intended, over time, to
satisfy the benefit obligations under the plan. risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial position. the asset mix guidelines
have been established and are reviewed quarterly. these guidelines are intended to serve as tools to facilitate the investment of plan assets to maximize long-term total return and the
ongoing oversight of the plan's investment performance. investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through daily and monthly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability
measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.

the
company's overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit
payments with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. the current target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income
securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. equity securities primarily include investments in large, medium and small-cap companies primarily located in
the united states. fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, u.s. treasury securities and debt securities issued by foreign
governments. other investments include two private equity funds held by the company's qualified defined benefit pension plan. one private equity fund is focused on financial companies, and the other
is focused on real estate-related investments. other investments at december31, 2011 also included a hedge fund which was a multi-strategy "fund of funds."
fair value measurementpension plans and other postretirement benefit assets
for a discussion of the methods employed by the company to measure the fair value of invested assets, see note4. the following
discussion of fair value measurements applies exclusively to the company's pension plans and other postretirement benefit assets.
fair
value estimates for equity and bond mutual funds held by the pension plans reflect prices received from an external pricing service that are based on observable market transactions.
these estimates are included in level1.
short-term
securities are carried at fair value which approximates cost plus accrued interest or amortized discount. the fair value or market value of these is periodically
compared to this amortized cost and is based on significant observable inputs as determined by an external pricing service. accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such short-term
securities, other than u.s. treasury securities and money market mutual funds, provided by an external pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. the
estimated fair value of u.s. treasury securities and money market mutual funds is included in the amount disclosed in level1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.

savings plan
the company has a savings plan, the travelers 401(k) savings plan (the savings plan), in which substantially all u.s. domestic company
employees are eligible to participate. under the savings plan, the company matches employee contributions up to 5% of eligible pay, with a maximum annual match of $5,000 which becomes 100% vested
after three years of service. for the year ended december31, 2011, existing employees whose annual base salary on december31, 2010 was $175,000 or more, and employees hired during 2011
at an annual base salary of $175,000 or more, were not eligible for the company's matching contribution. the company's matching contribution is made in cash and invested according to the employee's
current investment elections. the company's matching contribution can be reinvested at any time into any other investment option. the company's non-u.s. employees participate in separate
savings plans. the total expense related to all of the savings plans was $92million, $90million and $94million for the years ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.
included
in the savings plan are a legacy savings plus plan (spp) and a stock ownership plan (sop) in which substantially all employees who were hired by legacy spc before
april1, 2004 were eligible to participate. in 2004 under the spp, the company matched 100% of employees' contributions up to a maximum of 6% of their salary. the match was in the form of
preferred shares, to the extent available in the sop, or in the company's common shares. also allocated to participants were preferred shares equal to the value of dividends on previously allocated
shares. each share of preferred stock paid a dividend of $11.72 annually and was convertible into eight shares of the company's common stock. the sop has no preferred shares available for future
allocations. as described in more detail in note9
above, all preferred shares outstanding on june7, 2011 (190,083 shares) were converted into a total of 1.52million shares of the company's common stock.
all

16. contingencies, commitments and guarantees
contingencies
the major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the company or any of
its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the company's properties is subject are described below.
asbestos- and environmental-related proceedings
in the ordinary course of its insurance business, the company has received and continues to receive claims for insurance arising under
policies issued by the company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage litigation, including, among others,
the litigation described below. the company is defending asbestos-and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses; however, the outcomes of
these disputes are uncertain. in this regard, the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling
litigation under appropriate circumstances.
asbestos direct action litigationin october 2001 and april 2002, two purported class action suits (wise v.
travelers and meninger v. travelers) were filed against travelers property casualty corp. (tpc) and other insurers (not
including the st.paul companies,inc. (spc)) in state court in west virginia. these and other cases subsequently filed in west virginia were consolidated into a single proceeding in the
circuit court of kanawha county, west virginia. the plaintiffs allege that the insurer defendants engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of state statutes by inappropriately handling and
settling asbestos claims. the plaintiffs seek to reopen large numbers of settled asbestos claims and to impose liability for damages, including punitive damages, directly on insurers. similar lawsuits
alleging inappropriate handling and settling of asbestos claims were filed in massachusetts and hawaii state courts. these suits are collectively referred to as the statutory and hawaii actions.
in
march 2002, the plaintiffs in consolidated asbestos actions pending before a mass tort panel of judges in west virginia state court amended their complaint to include tpc as a
defendant, alleging that tpc and other insurers breached alleged duties to certain users of asbestos products. the plaintiffs seek damages, including punitive damages. lawsuits seeking similar relief
and raising similar allegations, primarily violations of purported common law duties to third parties, have also been asserted in various state courts against tpc and spc. the claims asserted in these
suits are collectively referred to as the common law claims.
in
response to these claims, tpc moved to enjoin the statutory actions and the common law claims in the federal bankruptcy court that had presided over the bankruptcy of tpc's former
policyholder johns-manville corporation on the ground that the suits violated injunctions entered in connection with confirmation of the johns-manville bankruptcy (the "1986 orders"). the bankruptcy
court issued a temporary restraining order and referred the parties to mediation. in november 2003,

the
parties reached a settlement of the statutory and hawaii actions, which included a lump-sum payment of up to $412million by tpc, subject to a number of significant
contingencies. in may 2004, the parties reached a settlement resolving substantially all pending and similar future common law claims against tpc, which included a payment of up to $90million
by tpc, subject to similar contingencies. among the contingencies for each of these settlements was that the bankruptcy court issue an order, which must become a final order, clarifying that all of
these claims, and similar future asbestos-related claims against tpc, as well as related contribution claims, are barred by the 1986 orders.
on
august17, 2004, the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the settlements and clarifying that the 1986 orders barred the pending statutory and hawaii actions and
substantially all common law claims pending against tpc (the "clarifying order"). the clarifying order also applies to similar direct action claims that may be filed in the future. although the
district court substantially affirmed the clarifying order, on february15, 2008, the second circuit issued an opinion vacating on jurisdictional grounds the district court's approval of the
clarifying order.
on
december12, 2008, the united states supreme court granted tpc's petition for writ of certiorari and, on june18, 2009, the supreme court reversed the second circuit's
february15, 2008 decision, finding, among other things, that the 1986 orders are final and therefore may not be collaterally challenged on jurisdictional grounds. the supreme court further
ruled that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to issue the clarifying order. however, since the second circuit had not ruled on certain additional issues, principally related to procedural matters
and the adequacy of notice provided to certain parties, the supreme court remanded the case to the second circuit for further proceedings on those specific issues.
on
march22, 2010, the second circuit issued an opinion in which it found that the notice of the 1986 orders provided to one remaining objector was insufficient to bar
contribution claims by that objector against tpc. tpc's petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc were denied may25, 2010 and, its petition
for writ of certiorari and petition for a writ of mandamus were denied by the united states supreme court on november29, 2010.
the
plaintiffs in the statutory and hawaii actions and the common law claims actions thereafter filed motions in the bankruptcy court to compel tpc to make payment under the settlement
agreements, arguing that all conditions precedent to the settlements had been met. on december16, 2010, the bankruptcy court granted the plaintiffs' motions and ruled that tpc was required to
fund the settlements. the court entered judgment against tpc on january20, 2011 in accordance with this ruling and ordered tpc to pay the settlement amounts plus prejudgment interest. the
bankruptcy court's judgment was reversed by the district court on march1, 2012, the district court having found that the conditions to the settlements had not been met in view of the second
circuit's march22, 2010 ruling permitting the filing of contribution claims against tpc. the plaintiffs appealed the district court's march1, 2012 decision to the second circuit court
of appeals. oral argument before the second circuit took place on january10, 2013, and the parties await the court's decision.
spc,
which is not covered by the manville bankruptcy court rulings or the settlements described above, from time to time has been named as a defendant in direct action cases in texas
state court asserting common law claims. all such cases that are still pending and in which spc has been served are currently on the inactive docket in texas state court. if any of those cases becomes
active, spc intends to litigate those cases vigorously. spc was previously a defendant in similar direct actions in

actions in other jurisdictions.
outcome and impact of asbestos and environmental claims and litigation.currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and
their impact on
the future development of claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. any such development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes
in applicable legislation. because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the company's current reserves. in addition, the company's estimate of ultimate
claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement
charges that could be material to the company's results of operations in future periods.
other proceedings not arising under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements
broker anti-trust litigationin 2005, four putative class action lawsuits were brought against a number of insurance brokers and insurers,
including the company, by plaintiffs who allegedly purchased insurance products through one or more of the defendant brokers. the plaintiffs alleged that various insurance brokers conspired with each
other and with various insurers, including the company, to artificially inflate premiums, allocate brokerage customers and rig bids for insurance products offered to those customers. to the extent
they were not originally filed there, the federal class actions were transferred to the u.s. district court for the district of new jersey and were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings
with other class actions under the caption in re insurance brokerage antitrust litigation. on august1, 2005, various plaintiffs, including the
four named plaintiffs in the above-referenced class actions, filed an amended consolidated class action complaint naming various brokers and insurers, including the company, on behalf of a putative
nationwide class of policyholders. the complaint included causes of action under the sherman act, the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act (rico), state common law and the laws of the
various states prohibiting antitrust violations. the complaint sought monetary damages, including punitive damages and trebled damages, permanent injunctive relief, restitution, including disgorgement
of profits, interest and costs, including attorneys' fees. all defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. after giving plaintiffs multiple opportunities to replead, the
court dismissed the sherman act claims on august31, 2007 and the rico claims on september28, 2007, both with prejudice, and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the
state law claims. the plaintiffs appealed the district court's decisions to the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit. on august16, 2010, the third circuit affirmed the district court's
dismissal of all sherman act and rico claims against certain defendants, including the company, except for sherman act and rico claims involving the sale of excess casualty insurance through a single
defendant broker, as well as all state law claims, which they remanded to the district court for further proceedings. on october1, 2010, defendants, including the company, filed renewed
motions to dismiss the remanded claims. on march18, 2011, the company and certain other defendants entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit, under which the company
agreed to pay $6.75million. preliminary approval of the settlement
was granted on june27, 2011. on september14, 2011, the court conducted a final fairness hearing, and on march30, 2012, the court granted final approval of the settlement. on
april27, 2012, three members of the settlement class appealed the court's order granting final approval of the settlement to the u.s. court of appeals

for
the third circuit. each of those appeals has been dismissed. accordingly, the settlement will proceed in accordance with the district court's final approval order and the company's involvement in
these class actions is concluded.
otherin addition to those described above, the company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages relating
to insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements. based upon currently available information, the company does not believe it is
reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the company's results of operations or have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position or
liquidity.
gain contingencies
on august17, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in new york state court captioned united states
fidelity& guaranty company v. american re-insurance company, et al., the trial court granted summary judgment for united states fidelity and guaranty
company (usf&g), a subsidiary of the company, and denied summary judgment for american re-insurance company, a subsidiary of munich re (american re), and three other reinsurers. by order
dated october22, 2010, the trial court corrected certain clerical errors and made certain clarifications to the august17, 2010 order. on october25, 2010, judgment was entered
against american re and the other three insurers, awarding usf&g $420million, comprising $251million ceded under the terms of the disputed reinsurance contract plus interest of 9%
amounting to $169million as of that date. the judgment, including the award of interest, was appealed by the reinsurers to the new york supreme court, appellate division, first department. on
january24, 2012, the appellate division affirmed the judgment. on january30, 2012, the reinsurers filed a motion with the appellate division seeking permission to appeal its decision
to the new york court of appeals, and on march12, 2012, the appellate division granted the reinsurers' motion. on february7, 2013, the court of appeals issued an opinion that largely
affirmed the summary judgment in usf&g's favor, while modifying in part the summary judgment with respect to two discrete issues and remanding the case to the trial court for determination of those
issues. the company believes it has a meritorious
position on each of these issues and intends to pursue its claim vigorously. at december31, 2012, the claim totaled $470 million, comprising $251 million of reinsurance recoverable plus
interest which had grown to $219million as of that date. interest will continue to accrue at 9% until the claim is paid. the $251million of reinsurance recoverable owed to usf&g under
the terms of the disputed reinsurance contract has been reported as part of reinsurance recoverables in the company's consolidated balance sheet. the interest that would be owed as part of any
judgment ultimately entered in favor of usf&g is treated for accounting purposes as a gain contingency in accordance with fasb topic 450, contingencies,
and accordingly has not been recognized in the company's consolidated financial statements.
in
an unrelated action, the travelers indemnity company is one of the settlement class plaintiffs and a class member in a class action lawsuit captioned safeco
insurance company of america, et al. v. american international group,inc. et al. (u.s. district court, n.d. ill.) in which the defendants are alleged to have engaged in
the under-reporting of workers' compensation premium in connection with a workers' compensation reinsurance pool in which several subsidiaries of the company participate. on july26, 2011, the
court granted preliminary approval of a class settlement pursuant to which the defendants agreed to pay $450million to the class. the settlement includes a plan of allocation of the

settlement
proceeds among the class members. on december21, 2011, the court entered an order granting final approval of the settlement, and on february28, 2012, the district court
issued a written opinion regarding its approval of the settlement. on march27, 2012, three parties who objected to the settlement appealed the court's orders approving the settlement to the
u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit. on january11, 2013, all parties, including the three parties who had objected to the settlement, filed a stipulation of dismissal indicating that
there were no longer any objections to the settlement. all parties are awaiting an order from the seventh circuit in response to the stipulation of dismissal. the company anticipates that its
allocation from the settlement fund, in the event the settlement becomes final, will be approximately $90million. this amount is treated for accounting purposes as a gain contingency in
accordance with fasb topic 450, contingencies, and accordingly will be recognized in the company's consolidated financial statements during the period
in which it is received by the company.
other commitments and guarantees
commitments
investment commitmentsthe company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships in which it invests.
these commitments totaled $1.27billion and $1.15billion at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
guarantees
in the ordinary course of selling business entities to third parties, the company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising
out of breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the business entities being sold, covenants and obligations of the company and/or its subsidiaries following the closing, and in
certain cases obligations arising from undisclosed liabilities, adverse reserve development, imposition of additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the
tax law, or certain named litigation. such indemnification provisions generally survive for periods ranging from seven years following the applicable closing date to the expiration of the relevant
statutes of limitations, although, in some cases, there may be other agreed upon term limitations or no term limitations. certain of these contingent obligations are subject to deductibles which have
to be incurred by the obligee before the company is obligated to make payments. the maximum amount of the company's contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of business entities
that are quantifiable was $471million at december31, 2012, of which $9million was recognized on the balance sheet at that date.
the
company also has contingent obligations for guarantees related to certain investments, third-party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of
former insurance subsidiaries, and various other indemnifications. the company also provides standard indemnifications to service providers in the normal course of business. the indemnification
clauses are often standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications have no stated or notional amounts or limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and,
accordingly, the company is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential payments for such arrangements. the maximum amount of the company's obligation for guarantees of certain investments
and third-party loans related to certain investments that are quantifiable was $129million at december31, 2012, approximately $63million of which is indemnified by a third
party. the maximum amount of the company's

obligation
related to the guarantee of certain insurance policy obligations of a former insurance subsidiary was $480million at december31, 2012, all of which is indemnified by a third
party.
17. noncash investing and financing activities
there were no material noncash financing or investing activities during the years ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
18. consolidating financial statements of the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
the following consolidating financial statements of the company have been prepared pursuant to rule3-10 of regulations-x. these consolidating
financial statements have been prepared from the company's financial information on the same basis of accounting as the consolidated financial statements. the travelers companies,inc. has
fully and unconditionally guaranteed certain debt obligations of tpc, its wholly-owned subsidiary, which totaled $1.20billion at december31, 2012.
prior
to the merger of tpc and spc in 2004, tpc fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of all principal, premiums, if any, and interest on certain debt obligations of its
wholly-owned subsidiary tighi. concurrent with the merger, the travelers companies,inc. fully and unconditionally assumed such guarantee obligations of tpc. tpc is deemed to have no assets or
operations independent of tighi. consolidating financial information for tighi has not been presented herein because such financial information would be substantially the same as the financial
information provided for tpc.

not applicable.
item9a.controls and procedures
the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in rules13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (exchange act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company's reports under the
exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission's rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. the
company's management, with the participation of the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company's
disclosure controls and procedures as of december31, 2012. based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded
that, as of december31, 2012, the design and operation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.
in
addition, there was no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the exchange act) that occurred during the quarter ended december31, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over
financial reporting.

management's report on internal control over financial reporting
management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the
company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements of the company in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the company's accounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained
by management, are under the general oversight of the company's audit committee.
the
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company's management and directors; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management
has assessed the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2012. the standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are
the measures in the internal controlintegrated framework published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
based
upon its assessment, management has concluded that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at december31, 2012, and that there were no
material weaknesses in the company's internal control over financial reporting as of that date.
kpmgllp,
an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this form10-k,
has issued its report on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting which follows this report.

report of independent registered public accounting firm
the
board of directors and stockholders
the travelers companies,inc.:
we
have audited the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries' (the company) internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2012, based on criteria
established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso).
the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.
we
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in
our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2012, based on criteria established in  internal controlintegrated
framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
we
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheet of the travelers
companies,inc. and subsidiaries as of december31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december31, 2012, and our report dated february19, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.

the company's
executive stock ownership policy. for a summary of this policy as currently in effect, see "compensation discussion and analysisstock ownership guidelines" in the company's proxy
statement filed with the securities and exchange commission (sec) on april10, 2012. from time to time, some of the company's executives may determine that it is advisable to diversify their
investments for personal financial planning reasons, or may seek liquidity for other reasons, and may sell shares of common stock of the company in the open market, in private transactions or to the
company. to effect such sales, some of the company's executives have entered into, and may in the future enter into, trading plans designed to comply with the company's securities trading policy and
the provisions of rule10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934. the trading plans will not reduce any of the executives' ownership of the company's shares below the
applicable executive stock ownership guidelines. the company does
not undertake any obligation to report rule10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any employee or director of the company in the future, or to report any modifications or termination
of any publicly announced plan.
as
of the date of this report, jay s. fishman, chairman and chief executive officer, and jay s. benet, vice chairman and chief financial officer were the only "named executive officers"

the travelers companies,inc.  (parent company only)         notes to the condensed financial information of registrant
1.other revenues
in 2010, other revenues included $60million of expenses related to the company's purchase and retirement of $885million of its $1.0billion
6.25% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures.
2.guarantees
in the ordinary course of selling business entities to third parties, the travelers companies,inc. (trv) has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses
arising out of breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the business entities being sold, covenants and obligations of trv and/or its subsidiaries following the closing, and in
certain cases obligations arising from undisclosed liabilities, adverse reserve development, imposition of additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the
tax law, or certain named litigation. such indemnification provisions generally survive for periods ranging from eight years following the applicable closing date to the expiration of the relevant
statutes of limitations, although, in some cases, there may be other agreed upon term limitations or no term limitations. certain of these contingent obligations are subject to deductibles which have
to be incurred by the obligee before trv is obligated to make payments. the maximum amount of trv's contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of business entities that are
quantifiable was $95million at december31, 2012, of which $9million was recognized on the balance sheet at that date.
trv
also has contingent obligations for guarantees related to its subsidiary's debt obligations and various other indemnifications. trv also provides standard indemnifications to service
providers in the normal course of business. the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications have no stated or notional amounts or
limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and, accordingly, trv is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential payments for such arrangements.
trv
fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment of all principal, premiums, if any, and interest on certain debt obligations of its subsidiaries tpc and travelers insurance group
holdingsinc. (tighi). the guarantees pertain to the $500million 5.00% notes due 2013, the $200million 7.75% notes due 2026 and the $500million 6.375% notes due 2033.
