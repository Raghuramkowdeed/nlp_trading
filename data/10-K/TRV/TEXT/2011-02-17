TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE COMPANY) IS A HOLDING COMPANY PRINCIPALLY

ENGAGED, THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, IN PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT UNITS, ASSOCIATIONS AND

INDIVIDUALS. THE COMPANY IS INCORPORATED AS A GENERAL BUSINESS CORPORATION UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA AND IS ONE OF THE OLDEST INSURANCE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, DATING BACK

TO 1853. THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF THE COMPANY ARE LOCATED AT 485 LEXINGTON AVENUE, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10017, AND ITS TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (917) 778-6000. THE COMPANY ALSO

MAINTAINS EXECUTIVE OFFICES IN HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT,

AND ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA. THE TERM "TRV" IN THIS DOCUMENT REFERS TO THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC., THE PARENT HOLDING COMPANY EXCLUDING SUBSIDIARIES.

FOR

A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND TOTAL ASSETS BY REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, SEE NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE AREAS OF PRICE, SERVICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AGENT

RELATIONSHIPS AND METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION. DISTRIBUTION METHODS INCLUDE THE USE OF INDEPENDENT AGENTS, EXCLUSIVE AGENTS, DIRECT MARKETING (INCLUDING USE OF TOLL-FREE NUMBERS AND THE

INTERNET) AND/OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES. ACCORDING TO A.M. BEST, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 981 PROPERTY AND CASUALTY GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES, COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 2,400 PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

COMPANIES. OF THOSE GROUPS, THE TOP 150 ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 92% OF THE CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRY'S TOTAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2009. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INSURERS.

IN ADDITION, SEVERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL

INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS, AND VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE, SOME OF WHICH UTILIZE CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS. THE

COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



PREMIUMS CHARGED;



CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS;



PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED;



CLAIM SERVICE;



AGENT, BROKER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS;



LOCAL PRESENCE;



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS;



OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH;



RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES;



EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES; AND



TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

IN

ADDITION, THE MARKETPLACE IS AFFECTED BY AVAILABLE CAPACITY OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, AS MEASURED BY POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE. INDUSTRY CAPACITY AS

MEASURED BY SURPLUS EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS PRIMARILY IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROFIT LEVELS GENERATED BY THE INDUSTRY, LESS AMOUNTS RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. CAPITAL

RAISED BY DEBT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS MAY ALSO INCREASE A COMPANY'S SURPLUS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN ESTIMATION OF EXPECTED LOSSES,

THE EXPENSES OF PRODUCING, ISSUING AND SERVICING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LOSS AND EXPENSE CASH FLOWS, AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT. THE

COMPANY HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES PROFITABLE GROWTH RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO

EACH STATE'S LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING RATE AND POLICY FORM APPROVALS. THE APPLICABLE STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISH STANDARDS IN CERTAIN LINES OF BUSINESS TO ENSURE THAT RATES ARE NOT

EXCESSIVE, INADEQUATE, UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY, OR USED TO ENGAGE IN UNFAIR PRICE COMPETITION. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO INCREASE RATES AND THE RELATIVE TIMING OF THE PROCESS ARE DEPENDENT UPON EACH

RESPECTIVE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE COMPETITIVE MARKET ENVIRONMENT.

CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE

THE WIDE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSES IT TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF

CATASTROPHES. THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR AND ANALYZE UNDERWRITING RISKS OF BUSINESS IN NATURAL

CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS AND TARGET RISK AREAS FOR CONVENTIONAL TERRORISM, WHICH EXCLUDES NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS. THE COMPANY RELIES, IN PART, UPON THIS ANALYSIS TO MAKE

UNDERWRITING DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE ON CATASTROPHE-EXPOSED BUSINESS. THE COMPANY LIMITS THE WRITING OF NEW PROPERTY AND HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS, AND EACH OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS HAVE SELECTIVELY TAKEN UNDERWRITING ACTION ON EXISTING BUSINESS IN SOME MARKETS. IN ADDITION, IN RECENT YEARS, EACH SEGMENT HAS ALSO TIGHTENED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, IMPLEMENTED

PRICE INCREASES IN SOME CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS AND PUT IN PLACE DEDUCTIBLES SPECIFIC TO HURRICANE-, WIND- AND HAIL-PRONE AREAS. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S

BUSINESS INSURANCE DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 10,500 INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

STATES THAT ARE SERVICED BY APPROXIMATELY 120 FIELD OFFICES AND THREE CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTERS. BUSINESS INSURANCE CONTINUES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ENHANCED TECHNOLOGY UTILIZING

INTERNET-BASED APPLICATIONS TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME INTERFACE CAPABILITIES WITH INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS. BUSINESS INSURANCE BUILDS RELATIONSHIPS WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED,

INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENCIES AND BROKERS. IN SELECTING NEW INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, BUSINESS INSURANCE CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER ATTRIBUTES, EACH AGENCY'S OR

BROKER'S PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, STAFF EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH THE COMPANY'S OPERATING AND MARKETING PLANS. ONCE AN AGENCY OR BROKER IS APPOINTED, BUSINESS INSURANCE CAREFULLY

MONITORS ITS PERFORMANCE. THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THE SELECT ACCOUNTS, COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS, INDUSTRY-FOCUSED UNDERWRITING AND TARGET-RISK UNDERWRITING GROUPS ARE DISTRIBUTED

THROUGH A COMMON BASE OF INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, MANY OF WHOM ALSO SELL THE COMPANY'S PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE INDUSTRY-FOCUSED UNDERWRITING AND TARGET RISK UNDERWRITING

EMPLOYEES. PRODUCTS OFFERED BY SELECT ACCOUNTS ARE GUARANTEED-COST POLICIES, INCLUDING PACKAGED PRODUCTS COVERING PROPERTY AND LIABILITY EXPOSURES. EACH SMALL BUSINESS RISK IS

INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATED VIA AN AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING PLATFORM WHICH IN TURN ENABLES AGENTS TO QUOTE, BIND AND ISSUE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SMALL BUSINESS RISKS AT THEIR DESKTOP. RISKS WITH MORE

COMPLEX CHARACTERISTICS ARE UNDERWRITTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF COMPANY PERSONNEL.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING PLATFORM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY STREAMLINED THE AGENT DESKTOP UNDERWRITING PROCESS, AND AS A RESULT, IT HAS ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF DISTRIBUTORS AFFILIATED

WITH SELECT ACCOUNTS.

BROKERS, PRIMARILY TARGETING MID-SIZED BUSINESSES WITH 50 TO 1,000 EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY OFFERS A FULL LINE OF PRODUCTS TO ITS COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS CUSTOMERS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON GUARANTEED

COST PROGRAMS. EACH ACCOUNT IS UNDERWRITTEN BASED ON THE UNIQUE RISK CHARACTERISTICS, LOSS HISTORY AND COVERAGE NEEDS OF THE ACCOUNT. THE ABILITY TO UNDERWRITE AT THIS DETAILED LEVEL ALLOWS COMMERCIAL

SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION

DISTRIBUTES ADMITTED AND EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY PRODUCTS PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH SELECTED

WHOLESALE AGENTS, BOTH ON A BROKERAGE AND MANAGING GENERAL UNDERWRITING BASIS, AND THROUGH SELECTED PROGRAM AGENTS. BROKERS, GENERAL AGENTS AND PROGRAM AGENTS OPERATE IN CERTAIN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT

TYPICALLY SERVED BY THE COMPANY'S APPOINTED RETAIL AGENTS, OR THEY MAINTAIN CERTAIN AFFINITY ARRANGEMENTS IN SPECIALIZED MARKET SEGMENTS. THE WHOLESALE EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES MARKET, WHICH IS

CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF RATE AND FORM REGULATION, ALLOWS FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY TO WRITE CERTAIN CLASSES OF BUSINESS. IN WORKING WITH WHOLESALE OR PROGRAM AGENTS ON A BROKERAGE BASIS,

SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION UNDERWRITES THE BUSINESS AND SETS THE PREMIUM LEVEL. IN WORKING WITH WHOLESALE OR PROGRAM AGENTS ON A MANAGING GENERAL UNDERWRITING OR PROGRAM MANAGER BASIS, THE AGENTS

PRODUCE AND UNDERWRITE BUSINESS SUBJECT TO UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR EACH FACILITY OR PROGRAM.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS INSURANCE HAS DEVELOPED AN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL

AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINES FOR PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH-QUALITY UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DISCIPLINE. IT UTILIZES PROPRIETARY DATA GATHERED

AND ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO ITS BUSINESS INSURANCE BUSINESS OVER MANY YEARS. THE UNDERWRITERS AND ENGINEERS USE THIS INFORMATION TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE RISKS PRIOR TO QUOTATION. THIS INFORMATION

PROVIDES SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. THIS

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

METHODOLOGY

ENABLES BUSINESS INSURANCE TO STREAMLINE ITS RISK SELECTION PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING PARAMETERS.

FOR

SMALLER BUSINESSES MEETING PRE-DETERMINED EXPOSURE CHARACTERISTICS AND THRESHOLDS, SELECT ACCOUNTS UTILIZES AN AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING SYSTEM THAT ENABLES AGENTS TO ISSUE

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF POLICIES AT THEIR DESKTOP.

A

PORTION OF BUSINESS IN THIS SEGMENT, PARTICULARLY IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSTRUCTION, IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE

CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT

AND IS SUBJECT TO

CREDIT RISK UNTIL SUCH REIMBURSEMENT IS MADE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES ON UNPAID LOSSES WITHIN THE DEDUCTIBLE LAYER OF LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES AND THE ASSOCIATED

RECEIVABLES WERE EACH APPROXIMATELY $5.34 BILLION. RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES ARE ALSO USED FOR WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGE. ALTHOUGH THE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED FEATURE OF THE POLICY

SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES INSURANCE RISK FOR THE COMPANY, IT INTRODUCES ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY. PREMIUM RECEIVABLES FROM HOLDERS OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY

$198 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CASH COLLATERAL OR TRUSTS, IS GENERALLY REQUESTED FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE

PLANS AND/OR RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES THAT PROVIDE FOR DEFERRED COLLECTION OF DEDUCTIBLE RECOVERIES AND/OR ULTIMATE PREMIUMS. THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL REQUESTED IS PREDICATED UPON THE

CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER AND THE NATURE OF THE INSURED RISKS. BUSINESS INSURANCE CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE CREDIT EXPOSURE ON INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS AND THE ADEQUACY OF COLLATERAL.

PRODUCT LINES

WORKERS' COMPENSATION

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYERS FOR SPECIFIED BENEFITS PAYABLE

UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW FOR WORKPLACE INJURIES TO EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE TYPICALLY FOUR TYPES OF BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICIES: MEDICAL BENEFITS, DISABILITY BENEFITS, DEATH

BENEFITS AND VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION BENEFITS. THE COMPANY EMPHASIZES MANAGED CARE COST CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES, WHICH INVOLVE EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES AND CARE PROVIDERS IN A COOPERATIVE EFFORT THAT

FOCUSES ON THE INJURED EMPLOYEE'S EARLY RETURN TO WORK AND COST-EFFECTIVE QUALITY CARE. THE COMPANY OFFERS THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION PRODUCTS.



GUARANTEED-COST INSURANCE PRODUCTS, IN WHICH POLICY PREMIUM CHARGES ARE FIXED FOR THE PERIOD OF COVERAGE AND

DO NOT VARY AS A RESULT OF THE INSURED'S LOSS EXPERIENCE;



LOSS-SENSITIVE INSURANCE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LARGE DEDUCTIBLE AND RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES, IN WHICH

FEES OR PREMIUMS ARE ADJUSTED BASED ON ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE OF THE INSURED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD; AND



SERVICE PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY SOLD TO THE COMPANY'S NATIONAL ACCOUNTS CUSTOMERS, WHERE THE COMPANY RECEIVES FEES

RATHER THAN PREMIUMS FOR PROVIDING LOSS PREVENTION, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND CLAIM AND BENEFIT ADMINISTRATION SERVICES TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER SERVICE AGREEMENTS.

THE

COMPANY ALSO PARTICIPATES IN STATE ASSIGNED RISK POOLS AS A SERVICING CARRIER AND POOL PARTICIPANT.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR BUSINESSES AGAINST LOSSES INCURRED FROM PERSONAL BODILY INJURY, BODILY INJURY TO THIRD

NET RETENTION POLICY

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S RETENTION POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT AS OF JANUARY 1,

2011. FOR THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY, BUSINESS INSURANCE GENERALLY LIMITS ITS NET RETENTION, THROUGH THE USE OF REINSURANCE, TO A MAXIMUM OF $18.8 MILLION PER INSURED, PER OCCURRENCE AFTER THE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS REPRESENTED IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE BY MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZE AS WELL AS OTHER

ENTITIES OFFERING RISK ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS OR CAPTIVE PROGRAMS. MARKET COMPETITION WORKS WITHIN THE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO SET THE PRICE CHARGED FOR

INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND THE LEVELS OF COVERAGE AND SERVICE PROVIDED. A COMPANY'S SUCCESS IN THE COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE LANDSCAPE IS LARGELY MEASURED BY ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE INSURANCE AND

SERVICES, INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING AND RISK CONTROL SERVICES, AT A PRICE AND ON TERMS THAT ARE REASONABLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE CUSTOMER, AS WELL AS ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND TO

ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS.

SELECT

ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY WRITTEN THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS AND DIRECT WRITERS. BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE IN THE SELECT ACCOUNTS MARKET WHICH GENERALLY COMPRISES LOWER-HAZARD, "MAIN STREET" BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. RISKS ARE UNDERWRITTEN AND PRICED USING STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICES

AND A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRODUCT OFFERINGS. COMPETITION IN THIS MARKET IS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRODUCT OFFERINGS, SERVICE LEVELS, EASE OF DOING BUSINESS AND PRICE. SELECT

ACCOUNTS HAS ESTABLISHED A STRONG MARKETING RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND HAS PROVIDED THIS NETWORK WITH DEFINED UNDERWRITING POLICIES, A BROAD ARRAY OF PRODUCTS, COMPETITIVE PRICES

AND A HIGHLY

EFFICIENT, AUTOMATED PLATFORM THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN QUOTING A PRICE ON A POLICY AND ISSUING THAT POLICY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED CENTRALIZED SERVICE

CENTERS TO HELP AGENTS PERFORM MANY SERVICE FUNCTIONS, IN RETURN FOR A FEE.

IN

RECENT YEARS, MANY INDEPENDENT PERSONAL INSURANCE AGENTS HAVE BEGUN TO UTILIZE PRICE COMPARISON RATING TECHNOLOGY, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS "COMPARATIVE RATERS," AS A

COST-EFFICIENT MEANS OF OBTAINING QUOTES FROM MULTIPLE COMPANIES. COMPARATIVE RATERS ALSO TEND TO PUT ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON PRICE OVER OTHER COMPETITIVE CRITERIA. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED TO ACCESS COMPARATIVE RATES FOR SMALL COMMERCIAL BUSINESS.

COMMERCIAL

ACCOUNTS BUSINESS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN PRINCIPALLY WRITTEN THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND PRICING, AND REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES. COMPANIES COMPETE BASED ON PRODUCT OFFERINGS, SERVICE LEVELS, PRICE

AND CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES. EFFICIENCY THROUGH AUTOMATION AND RAPID RESPONSE TIME TO CUSTOMER NEEDS IS ONE KEY TO SUCCESS IN THIS MARKET.

IN

THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS MARKET, COMPETITION IS BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES, MANAGED CARE COST CONTAINMENT, RISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS COMPETES WITH NATIONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, DISCOVER RE COMPETES WITH THOSE SAME INSURANCE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS WITH

OTHER UNDERWRITERS OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE IN THE ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER MARKET, SUCH AS RISK RETENTION GROUPS, SELF-INSURANCE PLANS, CAPTIVES MANAGED BY OTHERS, AND A

VARIETY OF OTHER RISK-FINANCING VEHICLES AND MECHANISMS. THE RESIDUAL MARKET GROUP COMPETES FOR STATE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS SERVICES

APPROXIMATELY 31% OF THE TOTAL WORKERS' COMPENSATION ASSIGNED RISK MARKET, MAKING THE COMPANY ONE OF THE LARGEST SERVICING CARRIERS IN THE INDUSTRY.

THERE

ARE SEVERAL OTHER BUSINESS GROUPS IN BUSINESS INSURANCE THAT COMPETE IN FOCUSED TARGET MARKETS. EACH OF THESE MARKETS IS DIFFERENT AND REQUIRES UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF INDUSTRY

KNOWLEDGE, CUSTOMIZED COVERAGE, SPECIALIZED RISK CONTROL AND LOSS HANDLING SERVICES, AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENTS AND BROKERS THAT ALSO FOCUS ON THESE MARKETS. SOME OF THESE BUSINESS GROUPS COMPETE

WITH NATIONAL CARRIERS WITH SIMILARLY DEDICATED UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING GROUPS, WHEREAS OTHERS COMPETE WITH SMALLER REGIONAL COMPANIES. EACH OF THESE BUSINESS GROUPS HAS REGIONAL STRUCTURES THAT

ALLOW THEM TO DELIVER PERSONALIZED SERVICE AND LOCAL KNOWLEDGE TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. SPECIALIZED AGENTS AND

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BROKERS,

INCLUDING MANAGING GENERAL AGENTS AND WHOLESALE AGENTS, SUPPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY. IN ALL OF THESE BUSINESS GROUPS, THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY TYPICALLY IS MARKET LEADERSHIP ATTAINED THROUGH

FOCUSED INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE APPLIED TO INSURANCE AND RISK NEEDS.

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE

THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT INCLUDES SURETY AND FINANCIAL LIABILITY COVERAGES, WHICH PRIMARILY

USE CREDIT-BASED UNDERWRITING PROCESSES, AS WELL AS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY PRODUCTS THAT ARE PRIMARILY MARKETED ON A DOMESTIC BASIS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, AND ON AN

ON

NOVEMBER 3, 2010, AN INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO COMMENCE A JOINT VENTURE WITH J. MALUCELLI

PARTICIPAÇÕES EM SEGUROS E RESSEGUROS S.A, A BRAZILIAN COMPANY ("J. MALUCELLI"), THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF APPROXIMATELY 43% OF J. MALUCELLI'S COMMON STOCK. J. MALUCELLI

IS CURRENTLY THE MARKET LEADER IN SURETY IN BRAZIL BASED ON MARKET SHARE, AND THE ACQUISITION PROVIDES A PLATFORM FOR POTENTIALLY EXPANDING ITS BUSINESS INTO THE BRAZILIAN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

MARKET. THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE R$625 MILLION BRAZILIAN REAIS (THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT OF WHICH WILL DEPEND ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AT CLOSING) PLUS AN AMOUNT BASED ON A

BRAZILIAN INTER-BANK LENDING RATE (CDI) FROM JANUARY 1, 2011 THROUGH THE CLOSING DATE OF THE TRANSACTION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, R$625 MILLION BRAZILIAN REAIS WAS

EQUIVALENT TO APPROXIMATELY $377 MILLION IN U.S. DOLLARS. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS AN OPTION TO INCREASE ITS INTEREST UP TO 49.9% OF THE COMMON STOCK OF J. MALUCELLI WITHIN 18 MONTHS. THE

PURCHASE PRICE IS EXPECTED TO BE PAID IN CASH FROM INTERNAL SOURCES. THE JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS AND IS EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2011.

MAJORITY OF ITS PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 6,100 OF THE SAME INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS THAT DISTRIBUTE THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT'S PRODUCTS. THESE BROKERS AND

THE

INTERNATIONAL MARKET DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS PRINCIPALLY THROUGH BROKERS IN THE DOMESTIC MARKETS OF EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES. IT ALSO WRITES BUSINESS AT LLOYD'S,

WHERE ITS PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH LLOYD'S WHOLESALE AND RETAIL BROKERS. BY VIRTUE OF LLOYD'S WORLDWIDE LICENSES, FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE HAS ACCESS TO

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS ACROSS THE WORLD. IN LATE 2008, THE COMPANY COMMENCED AN EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH A BROKER IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE 2009 VOLUME OF PERSONAL

AUTOMOBILE COVERAGE WRITTEN AND ALSO RESULTED IN THE COMPANY WRITING PERSONAL HOUSEHOLD COVERAGES. THE COMPANY CEASED WRITING BUSINESS THROUGH THIS RELATIONSHIP IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE HAS DEVELOPED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING METHODOLOGIES THAT INCORPORATE

DEDICATED UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINES. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DISCIPLINE, BASED ON AN

IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIFIC ACCOUNT, INDUSTRY OR COUNTRY. UNDERWRITERS USE INDUSTRY AND PROPRIETARY DATA GATHERED AND ANALYZED OVER MANY YEARS TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE RISKS PRIOR TO

QUOTATION, AND THEN USE PROPRIETARY FORMS (FOR NON-LLOYD'S AND NON-SURETY MARKETS) TO TAILOR

HIJACK, ILLEGAL DETENTION AND EXTORTION. WHILE THE COVERED HAZARDS MAY BE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE U.S. MARKET, THE DIFFERENT LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS CAN MAKE THE PRODUCT RISKS AND COVERAGE TERMS

POTENTIALLY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THE COMPANY FACES IN THE UNITED STATES.

OTHER

COVERAGES INCLUDE PROPERTY, WORKERS' COMPENSATION, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE AND COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED ABOVE IN

NET RETENTION POLICY

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S RETENTION POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL

LIABILITY, AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY, FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE GENERALLY LIMITS NET RETENTIONS, THROUGH THE USE OF REINSURANCE, TO UP TO $16.2 MILLION

RETENTIONS IF THE AGGREGATE LIMITS OR CAPS ARE REACHED. THE COMPANY UTILIZES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIMITS CAPACITY OR TO REDUCE RETENTIONS ON AN INDIVIDUAL RISK BASIS. THE

COMPANY MAY ALSO RETAIN AMOUNTS GREATER THAN THOSE DESCRIBED HEREIN BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RISK.

COMPETITION

THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE IN WHICH BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS OPERATES IS AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS DESCRIBED

PREVIOUSLY FOR THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL

PRODUCTS AND PRICING AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMPANIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED NICHE PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

BOND &

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS UNDERWRITES AND MARKETS ITS PRODUCTS TO NATIONAL, MID-SIZED AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS, AND DISTRIBUTES

THEM THROUGH BOTH NATIONAL AND WHOLESALE BROKERS, REGIONAL BROKERS AND RETAIL AGENTS. ITS REPUTATION FOR TIMELY AND CONSISTENT DECISION MAKING, A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCAL UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS AND

INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND STRONG PRODUCER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AS WELL AS ITS ABILITY TO OFFER ITS CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE OF PRODUCTS, PROVIDES BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AN ADVANTAGE OVER

MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS AND ENABLES IT TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN A COMPLEX, DYNAMIC MARKETPLACE. THE ABILITY OF BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS TO CROSS-SELL ITS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS OF

THE BUSINESS INSURANCE AND PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENTS PROVIDES ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES FOR THE COMPANY.

INTERNATIONAL

COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC INSURERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. COMPANIES COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, PRODUCT

OFFERINGS AND THE LEVEL OF CLAIM AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROVIDED. THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED EXPERTISE IN VARIOUS MARKETS IN THESE COUNTRIES SIMILAR TO THOSE SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES AND

PROVIDES BOTH PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COVERAGE FOR THESE MARKETS. PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A RELATIVELY SMALL AGENT AND BROKER BASE WHOSE CUSTOMER GROUPS ALIGN WITH THE COMPANY'S

TARGETED MARKETS.

AT

LLOYD'S, INTERNATIONAL COMPETES WITH OTHER SYNDICATES OPERATING IN THE LLOYD'S MARKET AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC INSURERS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS WHERE THE LLOYD'S OPERATION

WRITES BUSINESS WORLDWIDE. COMPETITION IS AGAIN BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT AND SERVICE. THE COMPANY FOCUSES ON LINES IT BELIEVES IT CAN UNDERWRITE EFFECTIVELY AND PROFITABLY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON

SHORT-TAIL INSURANCE LINES.

PRINCIPAL MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION

PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 12,400 INDEPENDENT AGENTS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

STATES, SUPPORTED BY PERSONNEL IN 16 MARKETING REGIONS AND SEVEN SERVICE CENTERS. IN SELECTING NEW INDEPENDENT AGENCIES TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, PERSONAL INSURANCE CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER

ATTRIBUTES, EACH AGENCY'S PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL STABILITY, STAFF EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH PERSONAL INSURANCE'S OPERATING AND MARKETING PLANS. ONCE AN AGENCY IS APPOINTED, PERSONAL

INSURANCE CAREFULLY MONITORS ITS PERFORMANCE. WHILE THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE'S INSURANCE PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO BE IN STATES ALONG THE EAST COAST, CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS, PERSONAL

INSURANCE CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE USES A CONSISTENT OPERATING MODEL THAT PROVIDES TECHNOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES TO INDEPENDENT AGENTS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR EASE OF DOING BUSINESS. PERSONAL INSURANCE

INDEPENDENT AGENTS QUOTE AND ISSUE NEARLY ALL OF PERSONAL INSURANCE'S NEW BUSINESS POLICIES DIRECTLY FROM THEIR AGENCIES BY LEVERAGING EITHER THEIR OWN AGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR USING PERSONAL

INSURANCE'S PROPRIETARY QUOTE AND ISSUANCE SYSTEMS WHICH ALLOW AGENTS TO RATE, QUOTE AND ISSUE POLICIES ON LINE. ALL OF THESE QUOTE AND ISSUE PLATFORMS INTERFACE WITH PERSONAL INSURANCE'S UNDERWRITING

AND RATING SYSTEMS, WHICH MONITOR

TRANSACTIONS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH PERSONAL INSURANCE'S UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PROGRAMS. BUSINESS PROCESSED BY AGENTS ON THESE PLATFORMS IS SUBJECT TO CONSULTATIVE REVIEW BY PERSONAL INSURANCE'S

IN-HOUSE UNDERWRITERS.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE CONTINUES TO DEVELOP FUNCTIONALITY TO PROVIDE ITS AGENTS WITH ONLINE SERVICE CAPABILITIES PACKAGED TOGETHER IN AN AGENCY SERVICE PORTAL, INCLUDING CUSTOMER SERVICE,

MARKETING AND CLAIM FUNCTIONALITY. AGENCIES CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO SHIFT THE ONGOING SERVICE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE'S CUSTOMERS TO ONE OF THE COMPANY'S FOUR CUSTOMER CARE CENTERS, WHERE THE

COMPANY PROVIDES, ON BEHALF OF AN AGENCY, A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF DIRECT CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS, INCLUDING RESPONSE TO BILLING AND COVERAGE INQUIRIES, AND POLICY CHANGES. APPROXIMATELY 1,950 AGENTS

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SERVICE ALTERNATIVE.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE ALSO MARKETS THROUGH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INCLUDING SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS EMPLOYERS AND CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS, AND DIRECT MARKETING. PERSONAL

THE SALES AND SERVICE FOR THESE PROGRAMS EITHER THROUGH A SPONSORING INDEPENDENT AGENT OR THROUGH TWO OF THE COMPANY'S CALL CENTER LOCATIONS. A NUMBER OF WELL-KNOWN CORPORATIONS

MAKE THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS AVAILABLE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES PRIMARILY THROUGH A PAYROLL DEDUCTION PAYMENT PROCESS. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN

AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION (AAA) CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER AFFINITY GROUPS THAT MAKE AVAILABLE PERSONAL INSURANCE'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO THEIR MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, SINCE 1995, THE COMPANY HAS

HAD A MARKETING AGREEMENT WITH GEICO TO UNDERWRITE HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS FOR THEIR AUTO CUSTOMERS. THIS AGREEMENT HAS ADDED PROFITABLE BUSINESS AND HELPED TO GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSIFY THE HOMEOWNERS LINE

OF BUSINESS. IN 2009, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD LAUNCHED A NEW DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL MARKETING INSURANCE DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. THE INVESTMENT IN THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE GENERATED

MODEST GROWTH IN PREMIUM VOLUME FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE IN 2009 AND 2010, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE, WHILE INTENDED TO ENHANCE

THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN A CONSUMER-DRIVEN MARKETPLACE, IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNPROFITABLE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AS THIS BUSINESS GROWS AND MATURES.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PERSONAL INSURANCE HAS DEVELOPED A PRODUCT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT INTEGRATES THE DISCIPLINES OF UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, ACTUARIAL AND

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING DISCIPLINE AND PRICING SEGMENTATION. PROPRIETARY DATA ACCUMULATED OVER MANY YEARS IS ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO

PERSONAL INSURANCE'S BUSINESS. PERSONAL INSURANCE USES A VARIETY OF PROPRIETARY AND VENDOR PRODUCED RISK DIFFERENTIATION MODELS TO FACILITATE ITS PRICING SEGMENTATION. PERSONAL INSURANCE'S PRODUCT

MANAGERS ESTABLISH UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES

INTEGRATED WITH ITS FILED PRICING AND RATING PLANS, WHICH ENABLE PERSONAL INSURANCE TO EXECUTE ITS RISK SELECTION AND PRICING PROCESSES.

PRICING

FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE IS DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF AUTOMOBILE REPAIRS, MEDICAL CARE AND LITIGATION OF

LIABILITY CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON PROMPTLY IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO DISPARITIES BETWEEN PREMIUM LEVELS AND PROJECTED CLAIM COSTS, AND

OBTAINING APPROVAL FROM STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WHEN NECESSARY FOR FILED RATE CHANGES.

PRICING

IN THE HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS IS ALSO DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF BUILDING SUPPLIES, LABOR AND HOUSEHOLD POSSESSIONS.

IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY MULTIPLE PERIL COVERAGE, THE PROFITABILITY AND PRICING OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IS AFFECTED BY THE INCIDENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE

RELATED TO WEATHER AND EARTHQUAKES. CHANGES TO METHODS OF MARKETING AND UNDERWRITING IN SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO STATE-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, WHICH CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN INSURER TO

SIGNIFICANTLY MANAGE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES.

INSURERS

WRITING PERSONAL LINES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES MAY BE UNABLE TO INCREASE PRICES UNTIL SOME TIME AFTER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COVERAGE HAVE INCREASED, PRIMARILY BECAUSE

OF STATE INSURANCE RATE REGULATION. THE PACE AT WHICH AN INSURER CAN CHANGE RATES IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED COSTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON WHETHER THE APPLICABLE STATE LAW REQUIRES PRIOR APPROVAL OF RATE

INCREASES OR NOTIFICATION TO THE REGULATOR EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER A RATE CHANGE IS IMPOSED. IN STATES WITH PRIOR APPROVAL LAWS, RATES MUST BE APPROVED BY THE REGULATOR BEFORE BEING USED BY THE

INSURER. IN STATES HAVING "FILE-AND-USE" LAWS, THE INSURER MUST FILE RATE CHANGES WITH THE REGULATOR, BUT DOES NOT NEED TO WAIT FOR APPROVAL BEFORE USING THE NEW RATES. A

"USE-AND-FILE" LAW REQUIRES AN INSURER TO FILE RATES WITHIN A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE INSURER BEGINS USING THE NEW RATE. APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE STATES

REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL OF MOST RATE CHANGES. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO RAISE PRICES, MODIFY UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCE EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO

CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CHANGES IN THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND/OR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING ACCESS TO OTHER UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES.

INDEPENDENT

AGENTS EITHER UTILIZE ONE OF THE COMPANY'S AUTOMATED QUOTE AND ISSUE SYSTEMS OR THEY SUBMIT APPLICATIONS TO THE COMPANY'S SERVICE CENTERS FOR UNDERWRITING REVIEW, QUOTE, AND

ISSUANCE. AUTOMATED TRANSACTIONS ARE EDITED BY THE COMPANY'S SYSTEMS AND ISSUED IF THEY CONFORM TO ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. EXCEPTIONS ARE REVIEWED BY UNDERWRITERS IN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS CENTERS.

AUDITS ARE CONDUCTED BY AN INTERNAL PEER REVIEW TEAM ACROSS ALL OF THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AGENCY GENERATED BUSINESS ON A SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING BASIS. EACH AGENT IS ASSIGNED TO A SPECIFIC EMPLOYEE OR

TEAM OF EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THE AGENT ON BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND OVERALL

GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY USES AGENCY LEVEL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION TO ANALYZE AND UNDERSTAND RESULTS AND TO IDENTIFY ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES.

THE

PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH ADDITIONAL MARKETING CHANNELS UTILIZE THE SAME ISSUANCE SYSTEMS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY, AND ANY EXCEPTIONS ARE ALSO UNDERWRITTEN BY THE

COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES. BUSINESS DERIVED THROUGH THESE CHANNELS IS MARKETED BY EXTERNAL PERSONNEL, WHO WORK WITH COMPANY MANAGEMENT ON BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND OVERALL GROWTH AND

PROFITABILITY. CHANNEL-SPECIFIC PRODUCTION AND CLAIM INFORMATION IS USED TO ANALYZE RESULTS AND IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES.

THE PRIMARY COVERAGES IN PERSONAL INSURANCE ARE PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS. PERSONAL INSURANCE

HAD APPROXIMATELY 7.7 MILLION ACTIVE POLICIES (E.G., POLICIES-IN-FORCE) AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY TO OTHERS FOR BOTH BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE AND FOR PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO AN

INSURED'S OWN VEHICLE FROM COLLISION AND VARIOUS OTHER PERILS. IN ADDITION, MANY STATES REQUIRE POLICIES TO PROVIDE FIRST-PARTY PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION, FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AS

NO-FAULT COVERAGE.

HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER

WELL AS COVERAGE FOR PERSONAL LIABILITY. THE COMPANY WRITES HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE FOR DWELLINGS, CONDOMINIUMS AND RENTAL PROPERTY CONTENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO WRITES COVERAGE FOR BOATS AND YACHTS,

PERSONAL ARTICLES SUCH AS JEWELRY, AND UMBRELLA LIABILITY PROTECTION.

NET RETENTION POLICY

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S RETENTION POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT AS OF JANUARY 1,

2011. THE COMPANY GENERALLY RETAINS ITS PRIMARY PERSONAL AUTO EXPOSURES IN THEIR ENTIRETY. FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY INSURANCE, THERE IS A $7.0 MILLION MAXIMUM RETENTION PER RISK. PERSONAL

INSURANCE RETAINS THE FIRST $10.0 MILLION OF UMBRELLA POLICIES AND PURCHASES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE FOR LIMITS OVER $10.0 MILLION. THE COMPANY UTILIZES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE TO

PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIMITS CAPACITY OR TO REDUCE RETENTIONS ON AN INDIVIDUAL RISK BASIS. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO RETAIN AMOUNTS GREATER THAN THOSE DESCRIBED HEREIN BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RISK.

COMPETITION

PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE IS WRITTEN BY HUNDREDS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZES. ALTHOUGH NATIONAL COMPANIES WRITE THE MAJORITY

OF THE BUSINESS, PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM LOCAL AND REGIONAL COMPANIES. PERSONAL INSURANCE PRIMARILY COMPETES BASED ON SERVICE, EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, PRICE, STABILITY OF THE

INSURER AND NAME RECOGNITION. PERSONAL INSURANCE COMPETES FOR BUSINESS WITHIN EACH INDEPENDENT AGENCY SINCE THESE AGENCIES ALSO OFFER POLICIES OF COMPETING COMPANIES. AT THE AGENCY LEVEL, COMPETITION

IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE LEVEL OF SERVICE, INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING, THE LEVEL OF AUTOMATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIVIDUAL AGENTS, AS WELL AS ON PRICE.

IN RECENT YEARS, MANY INDEPENDENT PERSONAL INSURANCE AGENTS HAVE BEGUN TO UTILIZE PRICE COMPARISON RATING TECHNOLOGY, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS "COMPARATIVE RATERS," AS A COST-EFFICIENT

MEANS OF OBTAINING QUOTES FROM MULTIPLE COMPANIES. COMPARATIVE RATERS ALSO TEND TO PUT ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON PRICE OVER OTHER COMPETITIVE CRITERIA. PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO COMPETES WITH INSURANCE

COMPANIES THAT USE EXCLUSIVE AGENTS OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THOSE THAT EMPLOY DIRECT MARKETING STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THE USE OF TOLL-FREE NUMBERS AND THE

INTERNET. IN ADDITION TO ITS TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENT AGENCY DISTRIBUTION, PERSONAL INSURANCE HAS BROADENED ITS DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS BY MARKETING TO SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE AND

AFFINITY GROUPS, THROUGH JOINT MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER INSURERS, AND DIRECT MARKETING. PERSONAL INSURANCE BELIEVES THAT ITS CONTINUED

FOCUS ON UNDERWRITING AND PRICING SEGMENTATION, CLAIM SETTLEMENT EFFECTIVENESS STRATEGIES AND EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ENABLE PERSONAL INSURANCE TO PRICE ITS PRODUCTS COMPETITIVELY IN ALL OF ITS

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY'S CLAIM FUNCTIONS ARE MANAGED THROUGH ITS CLAIMS SERVICES OPERATION, WITH LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE

COUNTRIES WHERE IT DOES BUSINESS. WITH MORE THAN 14,000 EMPLOYEES, CLAIMS SERVICES EMPLOYS A DIVERSE GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS, INCLUDING CLAIM ADJUSTERS, APPRAISERS, ATTORNEYS, INVESTIGATORS, ENGINEERS,

ACCOUNTANTS, SYSTEM SPECIALISTS AND TRAINING, MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL. APPROVED EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS INDEPENDENT ADJUSTERS AND APPRAISERS, INVESTIGATORS AND ATTORNEYS, ARE

AVAILABLE FOR USE AS APPROPRIATE.

U.S.

FIELD CLAIM MANAGEMENT TEAMS LOCATED IN 26 CLAIM CENTERS AND 55 SATELLITE AND SPECIALTY-ONLY OFFICES IN 46 STATES ARE ORGANIZED TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC CLAIM

CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE TO THE BUSINESSES WITHIN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS SEGMENTS. CLAIM TEAMS WITH SPECIALIZED SKILLS, RESOURCES, AND WORKFLOWS ARE MATCHED TO THE UNIQUE EXPOSURES OF THOSE BUSINESSES,

WITH LOCAL CLAIMS MANAGEMENT DEDICATED TO ACHIEVING OPTIMAL RESULTS WITHIN EACH SEGMENT. THE COMPANY'S HOME OFFICE OPERATIONS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF WORKFLOW DESIGN, QUALITY

MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCED MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS, TRAINING, FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONTROL, AND HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY. THIS STRUCTURE PERMITS THE COMPANY TO

MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF A LARGE, ESTABLISHED COMPANY WHILE RETAINING THE AGILITY TO RESPOND PROMPTLY TO THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS, BROKERS, AGENTS AND UNDERWRITERS. CLAIMS MANAGEMENT FOR

INTERNATIONAL IS GENERALLY PROVIDED LOCALLY BY STAFF IN THE RESPECTIVE INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS DUE TO LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, ALTHOUGH IT IS ALSO MANAGED BY THE COMPANY'S

U.S. CLAIMS SERVICES ORGANIZATION TO LEVERAGE THAT KNOWLEDGE BASE AND TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES.

AN

INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY TO BENEFIT CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS IS ITS CONTINUING INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INSURANCE FRAUD THROUGH ITS INVESTIGATIVE

SERVICES UNIT. THE COMPANY HAS A NATIONWIDE STAFF OF EXPERTS THAT INVESTIGATE A WIDE ARRAY OF INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEMES USING IN-HOUSE FORENSIC RESOURCES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS. THIS

STAFF ALSO HAS SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE IN FIRE SCENE EXAMINATIONS, MEDICAL PROVIDER FRAUD SCHEMES AND DATA MINING. THE COMPANY ALSO DEDICATES INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT VIOLATIONS OF LAW ARE

REPORTED TO AND PROSECUTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

CLAIMS

SERVICES USES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, AND DATA ANALYSIS TO ASSIST THE COMPANY IN REVIEWING ITS CLAIM PRACTICES AND RESULTS TO EVALUATE AND IMPROVE ITS CLAIMS

MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON SEGMENTATION OF CLAIMS AND APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL SPECIALIZATION TO DRIVE EFFECTIVE CLAIM RESOLUTION. THE COMPANY

CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS INVESTMENT IN CLAIM RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE FOCUS ON CLAIM OUTCOMES AND A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT. THE COMPANY OPERATES A

STATE-OF-THE-ART CLAIMS TRAINING FACILITY, OFFERING HANDS-ON EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING TO HELP ENSURE THAT ITS CLAIM PROFESSIONALS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED. IN

RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN MANY OF ITS CLAIM HANDLING OPERATIONS AND ROUTINELY MONITORS THE EFFECT OF THOSE INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE A CONSISTENT

OPTIMIZATION AMONG OUTCOMES, COST AND SERVICE.

IN

RECENT YEARS, CLAIMS SERVICES REFINED ITS CATASTROPHE RESPONSE STRATEGY TO INCREASE THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RESPOND TO A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHIC EVENT USING ITS OWN PERSONNEL,

ENABLING IT TO MINIMIZE RELIANCE ON INDEPENDENT ADJUSTORS AND APPRAISERS. THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED A LARGE DEDICATED CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM AND TRAINED A LARGE ENTERPRISE RESPONSE TEAM OF EXISTING

EMPLOYEES WHO CAN BE DEPLOYED ON SHORT NOTICE IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHE THAT GENERATES CLAIM VOLUME EXCEEDING THE CAPACITY OF THE DEDICATED CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM. IN RECENT YEARS, THESE

INTERNAL RESOURCES WERE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED TO RESPOND TO A RECORD NUMBER OF CATASTROPHE CLAIMS, INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM HURRICANES IKE, GUSTAV AND DOLLY IN 2008.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE CLAIM SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE COMPANY'S AUTO CLAIM SERVICE THAT FEATURES THREE

COMPANY-OWNED AUTO REPAIR FACILITIES AND SELECTED INDEPENDENTLY-OWNED AUTO REPAIR FACILITIES WITH COMPANY APPRAISERS

ON

SITE TO COMPLETE AN ESTIMATE, HANDLE ALL RENTAL ARRANGEMENTS AND MONITOR THE REPAIR PROCESS FROM START TO FINISH. BY MANAGING THE CLAIMS IN THIS WAY, THE COMPANY CAN HELP ENSURE PROMPT, QUALITY

RESULTS AND CREATE A DIFFERENTIATED, SUPERIOR CLAIM EXPERIENCE FOR CUSTOMERS.

ANOTHER

STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IS TRAVCOMP

SM

, A WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIM RESOLUTION AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT ASSISTS ADJUSTERS IN THE PROMPT INVESTIGATION AND

EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS. INNOVATIVE MEDICAL AND CLAIMS MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES PERMIT NURSE, MEDICAL AND CLAIMS PROFESSIONALS TO SHARE APPROPRIATE VITAL INFORMATION THAT

SUPPORTS PROMPT INVESTIGATION, EFFECTIVE RETURN TO WORK AND CLAIM RESOLUTION STRATEGIES. THESE TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH EFFECTIVE MATCHING OF PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND AUTHORITY TO SPECIFIC CLAIM

ISSUES, HAVE RESULTED IN MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS.

REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY REINSURES A PORTION OF THE RISKS IT UNDERWRITES IN ORDER TO CONTROL ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES. THE COMPANY CEDES TO REINSURERS

A PORTION OF THESE RISKS AND PAYS PREMIUMS BASED UPON THE RISK AND EXPOSURE OF THE POLICIES SUBJECT TO SUCH REINSURANCE. CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES CREDIT RISK, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO MANDATORY POOLS,

AND IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF THE REINSURANCE CEDED, THE COMPANY REMAINS LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS

REINSURED. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED AFTER REDUCTIONS FOR KNOWN INSOLVENCIES AND AFTER ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS COLLATERAL, INCLUDING TRUST AGREEMENTS,

ESCROW FUNDS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, UNDER CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF REINSURERS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND REVIEWS ITS REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS

PERIODICALLY. REINSURERS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES, THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL PROVIDED. AFTER REINSURANCE IS PURCHASED,

THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED ABILITY TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK TO A REINSURER. IN ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO

TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY

AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING REINSURANCE, SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS."

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LARGE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY LOSSES, INCLUDING.



FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE INSURANCE PROVIDED BY A SINGLE

POLICY AND EACH POLICY REINSURED IS SEPARATELY NEGOTIATED;



TREATY REINSURANCE, IN WHICH REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR A SPECIFIED TYPE OR CATEGORY OF RISKS; AND



CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE, IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INDEMNIFIED FOR AN AMOUNT OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED RETENTION WITH

RESPECT TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM A CATASTROPHIC EVENT.

FOR

A DESCRIPTION OF REINSURANCE-RELATED LITIGATION, SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY A VARIETY OF EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HURRICANES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL,

WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO RESULT FROM A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS),

EXPLOSIONS, INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES OR AS A CONSEQUENCE OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A

FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS;

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HOWEVER,

HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO

CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY WITH UNAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES. IN ADDITION TO THE COVERAGE PROVIDED UNDER THIS TREATY, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES A CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAM, AS WELL AS A NORTHEAST CATASTROPHE

REINSURANCE TREATY, TO PROTECT AGAINST CERTAIN LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.

GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY.

THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY COVERS THE ACCUMULATION OF NET PROPERTY LOSSES

ARISING OUT OF ONE

OCCURRENCE. THE TREATY COVERS ALL OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA AND THEIR POSSESSIONS AND WATERS CONTIGUOUS THERETO, THE CARIBBEAN AND MEXICO. THE TREATY ONLY PROVIDES

COVERAGE FOR TERRORISM EVENTS IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXCLUDES ENTIRELY LOSSES ARISING FROM NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL ATTACKS.

CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAM.

ON DECEMBER 18, 2009, LONGPOINT RE II, LTD. (LONGPOINT RE II), A NEWLY FORMED INDEPENDENT CAYMAN

ISLANDS

INSURANCE COMPANY, SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED AN OFFERING TO UNRELATED INVESTORS OF $500 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF CATASTROPHE BONDS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING, THE COMPANY AND

LONGPOINT RE II ENTERED INTO TWO REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS (COVERING A THREE-YEAR AND FOUR-YEAR PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY), EACH PROVIDING UP TO $250 MILLION OF REINSURANCE ON A

PROPORTIONAL BASIS FROM LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTAIN HURRICANE EVENTS IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.

UNDER

THE TERMS OF THESE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY ANNUAL REINSURANCE PREMIUMS TO LONGPOINT RE II FOR THE REINSURANCE COVERAGE. THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS

UTILIZE A DUAL TRIGGER THAT IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S COVERED LOSSES INCURRED AND AN INDEX THAT IS CREATED BY APPLYING PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGES TO INSURED INDUSTRY LOSSES IN EACH STATE IN THE

COVERED AREA AS REPORTED BY A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER. THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS MEET THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS REINSURANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE FOR REINSURANCE

CONTRACTS. AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE INDEX-BASED LOSSES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO APPROXIMATE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL LOSSES FROM ANY COVERED

EVENT. THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL LOSSES AND INDEX LOSSES FROM ANY COVERED EVENT MAY DIFFER. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE CATASTROPHE BONDS WILL BE REDUCED BY ANY AMOUNTS PAID TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS.

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

INDEX-BASED LOSSES ATTACHMENT POINT AND MAXIMUM LIMIT ARE RESET ANNUALLY TO MAINTAIN MODELED PROBABILITIES OF ATTACHMENT AND EXPECTED LOSS ON THE RESPECTIVE CATASTROPHE BONDS EQUAL

TO THE INITIAL MODELED PROBABILITIES OF ATTACHMENT AND EXPECTED LOSS. THE TWO REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR COVERED EVENTS OCCURRING BEFORE OR ON DECEMBER 18, 2012 AND

DECEMBER 18, 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY WILL BE ENTITLED TO BEGIN RECOVERING AMOUNTS UNDER THE TWO REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS IF THE INDEX-BASED LOSSES IN THE COVERED AREA FOR A SINGLE

OCCURRENCE REACH AN INITIAL ATTACHMENT AMOUNT OF $2.250 BILLION. THE FULL $250 MILLION COVERAGE AMOUNT OF EACH AGREEMENT IS AVAILABLE ON A PROPORTIONAL BASIS UNTIL INDEX-BASED LOSSES

REACH A MAXIMUM $2.850 BILLION LIMIT. THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCURRED ANY LOSSES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN A RECOVERY UNDER THE LONGPOINT RE II AGREEMENTS SINCE THEIR INCEPTION.

AS

WITH ANY REINSURANCE AGREEMENT, THERE IS CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTING AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS. WITH REGARD TO LONGPOINT RE II, THE CREDIT RISK IS MITIGATED BY TWO

REINSURANCE TRUST ACCOUNTS, ONE FOR EACH AGREEMENT. EACH REINSURANCE TRUST ACCOUNT HAS BEEN FUNDED BY LONGPOINT RE II WITH MONEY MARKET FUNDS THAT INVEST SOLELY IN DIRECT GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS BACKED

BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH MATURITIES OF NO MORE THAN 13 MONTHS. THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS MUST HAVE A PRINCIPAL STABILITY RATING OF AT LEAST AAAM BY STANDARD & POOR'S. OTHER PERMISSIBLE

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY DIRECT GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS BACKED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH TERMS OF NO MORE THAN 397 CALENDAR DAYS, AND CASH.

AT

THE TIME THE AGREEMENTS WERE ENTERED INTO WITH LONGPOINT RE II, THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT ADDRESSES VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES OR VIES.

UNDER THIS GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY THAT IS FORMED FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES IS CONSIDERED A VIE IF: (A) THE EQUITY INVESTORS LACK THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT ABILITY THROUGH VOTING RIGHTS OR SIMILAR RIGHTS

TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT AN ENTITY'S ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENTITY'S OPERATIONS, OR (B) THE EQUITY INVESTORS DO NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR THE

ENTITY TO SUPPORT ITS ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONALLY, A COMPANY THAT ABSORBS A MAJORITY OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES FROM A VIE'S ACTIVITIES OR IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE ENTITY'S EXPECTED RESIDUAL

RETURNS, OR BOTH, IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE VIE AND IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS

A RESULT OF THE EVALUATION OF THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH LONGPOINT RE II, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS A VIE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN ITEMS (A) AND

(B) ABOVE WERE PRESENT. HOWEVER, WHILE LONGPOINT RE II WAS DETERMINED TO BE A VIE, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT IT DID NOT HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST IN THE ENTITY, AS THE VARIABILITY IN ITS

RESULTS, CAUSED BY THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, IS EXPECTED TO BE ABSORBED ENTIRELY BY THE INVESTORS IN THE CATASTROPHE BONDS ISSUED BY THE LONGPOINT RE II AND RESIDUAL AMOUNTS EARNED BY IT, IF ANY,

ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABSORBED BY THE EQUITY INVESTORS (THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER AN EQUITY NOR A RESIDUAL INTEREST IN LONGPOINT RE II).

ACCORDINGLY,

THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF LONGPOINT RE II AND DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE THAT ENTITY IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE

THE COMPANY HAS NO INTENTION TO PURSUE ANY TRANSACTION THAT WOULD RESULT IN IT ACQUIRING INTEREST IN AND BECOMING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF LONGPOINT RE II, THE CONSOLIDATION OF THAT ENTITY IN THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS IS UNLIKELY.

NORTHEAST CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY.

IN ADDITION TO ITS GENERAL CATASTROPHE TREATY AND ITS MULTI-YEAR CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAM, THE

COMPANY ALSO IS PARTY TO A NORTHEAST GENERAL CATASTROPHE TREATY WHICH PROVIDES UP TO $600 MILLION OF COVERAGE, SUBJECT TO A $2.25 BILLION RETENTION, FOR LOSSES ARISING FROM HURRICANES,

EARTHQUAKES AND WINTER STORM OR FREEZE LOSSES FROM VIRGINIA TO MAINE FOR THE PERIOD JULY 1, 2010 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2011. LOSSES FROM A COVERED EVENT (OCCURRING OVER SEVERAL DAYS) ANYWHERE

IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, THE CARIBBEAN AND MEXICO MAY BE USED TO SATISFY THE RETENTION. RECOVERIES UNDER THE CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAMS (IF ANY) WOULD BE FIRST APPLIED TO REDUCE LOSSES SUBJECT TO

THIS TREATY.

EARTHQUAKE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATY

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO AN EARTHQUAKE EXCESS-OF-LOSS

TREATY THAT PROVIDES FOR UP TO $150 MILLION OF COVERAGE, SUBJECT TO A $125 MILLION RETENTION, FOR EARTHQUAKE LOSSES INCURRED UNDER POLICIES WRITTEN BY THE NATIONAL PROPERTY BUSINESS UNIT

IN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT FOR THE PERIOD JULY 1, 2010 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2011.

INTERNATIONAL REINSURANCE TREATIES.

FOR BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND IN THE COMPANY'S

OPERATIONS AT

LLOYD'S, SEPARATE REINSURANCE PROTECTIONS ARE PURCHASED LOCALLY THAT HAVE LOWER NET RETENTIONS MORE COMMENSURATE WITH THE SIZE OF THE RESPECTIVE LOCAL BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS AN ONGOING

REVIEW OF ITS RISK AND CATASTROPHE COVERAGES AND MAKES CHANGES AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM.

THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM) IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE

DEPARTMENT OF THE

TREASURY THAT PROVIDES FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN INTEREST. THE

PROGRAM HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED THROUGH 2014.

IN

ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS AND MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS

AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, IN CONCURRENCE WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. THE ANNUAL AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUM IS

$100 MILLION

THROUGH 2014. THE PROGRAM EXCLUDES FROM PARTICIPATION THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE: FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE, PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE,

HEALTH OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD INSURANCE, REINSURANCE, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY (OTHER THAN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS'), SURETY, BURGLARY AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS

MULTI-PERIL. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS' COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE PROGRAM. ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN THE UNITED STATES ARE

GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR 85% OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER

DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP.

THE

DEDUCTIBLE FOR ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS EQUAL TO 20% OF THE INSURER'S DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS FOR COVERED LINES FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER

THE PROGRAM IS $2.08 BILLION FOR 2011. THE ANNUAL CAP LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE

$100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, PARTICIPATING INSURERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM FOR ADDITIONAL COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES FOR THAT PROGRAM YEAR. THE COMPANY HAS HAD NO

TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED. SINCE THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS LAW IS UNTESTED, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW THEY WILL BE APPLIED TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES.

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ACTION COULD CHANGE THE PROGRAM. FURTHER, GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN

THE COMPANY'S OWN REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY "UNCONVENTIONAL" ACTS OF TERRORISM INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD BE

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE PERIODS. WHILE THE COMPANY SEEKS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING

CONVENTIONAL MEANS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ONE OR MORE MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING

SO-CALLED WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, INCLUDING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL MEANS.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS THAT INCLUDES REVIEW OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS, UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. THE

COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED.

IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, THE COMPANY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FOR REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION. THE RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE

COMPANY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING RESERVES AND A DISCUSSION OF UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND RISK FACTORS, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES."

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES (DISCUSSED BY PRODUCT LINE IN THE "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES" SECTION OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS") ARE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS

CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, INFLATION, JUDICIAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS

DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE UNDERLYING INSURANCE CONTRACT (E.G., CLAIMS-MADE VERSUS

OCCURRENCE), CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF THE OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM, AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE

OCCURRENCE OF THE INSURED EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

THE

COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES FOR UNREPORTED CLAIMS AND DEVELOPMENT ON REPORTED CLAIMS PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT BY ACCIDENT YEAR FOR

EACH TYPE OF EXPOSURE AND BUSINESS UNIT. SIMILARLY, THE COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES OF UNPAID LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS OF THE

RELATIONSHIP OF LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO LOSSES FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AND TYPE OF EXPOSURE. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY'S RESERVING METHODS FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION," AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION."

DISCOUNTING

THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MOST LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND ANNUITY CLAIM PAYMENTS, PRIMARILY

ARISING FROM WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE POLICIES, WERE DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS USING A RATE OF 5% AT BOTH

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. THESE DISCOUNTED RESERVES TOTALED $2.09 BILLION AND $2.16 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 RESPECTIVELY.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE DEVELOPMENT TABLE

THE TABLE THAT FOLLOWS SETS FORTH THE YEAR-END RESERVES FROM 2000 THROUGH 2010 AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THOSE

RESERVES, PRESENTED ON A HISTORICAL BASIS. THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND RE-ESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR THE YEARS 2000 THROUGH 2003 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED TO

REFLECT THE ACQUISITION BY TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. (SPC) IN 2004 (REFERRED TO HEREAFTER AS THE MERGER). THE TABLE INCLUDES SPC RESERVES

BEGINNING AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

IN

ADDITION, THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND RE-ESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR 2000 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE ACQUISITION OF NORTHLAND

AND COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY. BEGINNING IN 2001, THE TABLE INCLUDES THE RESERVE ACTIVITY OF NORTHLAND AND COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY. THE DATA IN THE TABLE IS PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO AVOID MISINTERPRETATION BY THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS INFORMATION OR FAMILIAR WITH OTHER DATA COMMONLY

REPORTED BY THE INSURANCE

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDUSTRY.

THE DATA IN THE TABLE IS NOT ACCIDENT YEAR DATA, BUT RATHER A DISPLAY OF 2000 TO 2010 YEAR-END RESERVES AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THOSE RESERVES.

FOR

INSTANCE, THE "CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY (REDUNDANCY)" SHOWN IN THE TABLE FOR EACH YEAR REPRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT BY WHICH ORIGINAL ESTIMATES OF RESERVES AS OF THAT

YEAR-END HAVE CHANGED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. ACCORDINGLY, THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY FOR A YEAR RELATES ONLY TO RESERVES AT THAT YEAR-END AND THOSE AMOUNTS ARE NOT ADDITIVE.

EXPRESSED ANOTHER WAY, IF THE ORIGINAL RESERVES AT THE END OF 2000 INCLUDED $4 MILLION FOR A LOSS THAT IS FINALLY PAID IN 2005 FOR $5 MILLION, THE $1 MILLION DEFICIENCY (THE

EXCESS OF THE ACTUAL PAYMENT OF $5 MILLION OVER THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF $4 MILLION) WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES IN EACH OF THE YEARS 2000 TO 2004 SHOWN IN THE

ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

VARIOUS

FACTORS MAY DISTORT THE RE-ESTIMATED RESERVES AND CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY OR REDUNDANCY SHOWN IN THE TABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE

DEFICIENCIES SHOWN IN THE TABLE ARISE FROM CLAIMS ON POLICIES WRITTEN PRIOR TO THE MID-1980S INVOLVING LIABILITY EXPOSURES SUCH AS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN THE

POST-1984 PERIOD, THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED MORE STRINGENT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND POLICY EXCLUSIONS AND HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRACTED OR TERMINATED THE WRITING OF THESE RISKS. SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION," AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION." GENERAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE LIABILITIES IN THE PAST WILL NOT NECESSARILY RECUR IN THE FUTURE.

OTHER

FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE DATA IN THE TABLE INCLUDE THE DISCOUNTING OF CERTAIN RESERVES (AS DISCUSSED ABOVE) AND THE USE OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED INSURANCE POLICIES. FOR EXAMPLE,

RESERVES FOR LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND ANNUITY CLAIM PAYMENTS (TABULAR RESERVES), PRIMARILY ARISING FROM WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE POLICIES,

ARE DISCOUNTED TO REFLECT THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. APPARENT DEFICIENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AS THE DISCOUNT ON THESE WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESERVES IS ACCRETED AT THE APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATES.

ALSO, A PORTION OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN WITH RETROSPECTIVELY RATED INSURANCE POLICIES IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE LOSS EXPERIENCE IS PRIMARILY BORNE BY THE INSURED. FOR THIS BUSINESS,

INCREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING INCREASE IN AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM INSUREDS. LIKEWISE, DECREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN A DECREASE IN RESERVES

AND AN OFFSETTING DECREASE IN AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM THESE INSUREDS. THE AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON THESE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES OR

REDUNDANCIES ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS BUT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE TABLE.

BECAUSE

OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL EXTRAPOLATION OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REDUNDANCIES OR DEFICIENCIES IN LOSS RESERVES FROM THE DATA IN THE TABLE.

ACQUIRED FROM CITIGROUP ON OCTOBER 1, 2001. ALSO INCLUDES RESERVES OF COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH WAS CONTRIBUTED TO TPC BY CITIGROUP ON OCTOBER 3, 2001. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2001, THESE GROSS RESERVES WERE $867 MILLION, AND NET RESERVES WERE $633 MILLION.

RECORDED BY TPC AND DOES NOT INCLUDE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED BY SPC. FOR 2004 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS, INCLUDES SPC RESERVES AND SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT RECORDED BY SPC. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004,

SPC GROSS RESERVES WERE $23,274 MILLION, AND NET RESERVES WERE $15,959 MILLION.

(C)

IN

DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA HOLDINGS LIMITED (UNIONAMERICA), WHICH COMPRISED ITS UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.)-BASED RUNOFF

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES. (UNIONAMERICA WAS ACQUIRED IN 2004 AS PART OF THE MERGER.) IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE SALE, THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES OF UNIONAMERICA TOTALED

$790 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF THE SALE, THOSE OBLIGATIONS CEASED BEING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE SALE IS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE AS A REDUCTION IN

DECEMBER 31, 2008 NET RESERVES OF $790 MILLION AND AS A $790 MILLION INCREASE IN PAID LOSSES FOR EACH OF THE YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2007 TO REFLECT THE TRANSFER (PAYMENT) OF THE

RESERVES TO THE BUYER, RESULTING IN NO IMPACT TO INCURRED LOSSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESERVES ON STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (NET OF REINSURANCE) SHOWN IN THE PRECEDING

TABLE, WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP RESERVES), WERE $20 MILLION, $18 MILLION AND $5 MILLION HIGHER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN

THOSE REPORTED IN THE COMPANY'S RESPECTIVE ANNUAL REPORTS FILED WITH INSURANCE REGULATORS, WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES (STATUTORY RESERVES).

THE

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GAAP AND STATUTORY RESERVES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN GAAP AND STATUTORY ACCOUNTING FOR TWO ITEMS, (1) FEES ASSOCIATED WITH BILLING OF

REQUIRED REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER LARGE DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS, AND (2) THE ACCOUNTING FOR RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE. FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY PAYS THE DEDUCTIBLE PORTION OF A CASUALTY

INSURANCE CLAIM AND THEN SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE INSURED, PLUS A FEE. THIS FEE IS REPORTED AS FEE INCOME FOR GAAP REPORTING, BUT AS AN OFFSET TO CLAIM EXPENSES PAID FOR STATUTORY REPORTING.

RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES RESULT FROM REINSURANCE PLACED TO COVER LOSSES ON INSURED EVENTS OCCURRING PRIOR TO THE INCEPTION OF A REINSURANCE CONTRACT. FOR GAAP REPORTING, RETROACTIVE

REINSURANCE BALANCES ARE INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND RESULT IN LOWER NET RESERVE AMOUNTS. STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES REQUIRE RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES TO BE RECORDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES AS CONTRA-LIABILITIES RATHER THAN IN LOSS RESERVES.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS ARE SEGREGATED FROM OTHER CLAIMS AND ARE HANDLED SEPARATELY BY THE COMPANY'S SPECIAL LIABILITY GROUP,

A SEPARATE UNIT STAFFED BY DEDICATED LEGAL, CLAIM, FINANCE AND ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION."

INTERCOMPANY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

MOST OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE MEMBERS OF AN INTERCOMPANY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENT.

POOLING ARRANGEMENTS PERMIT THE PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO RELY ON THE CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE POOL'S CAPITAL AND SURPLUS RATHER THAN JUST ON ITS OWN CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, THE

MEMBERS SHARE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INSURANCE BUSINESS THAT IS WRITTEN AND ALLOCATE THE COMBINED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES.

RATINGS

RATINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ASSESSING THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES RATINGS

FROM THE FOLLOWING MAJOR RATING AGENCIES: A.M. BEST COMPANY (A.M. BEST), FITCH RATINGS (FITCH), MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODY'S) AND STANDARD & POOR'S CORP. (S&P). RATING AGENCIES

TYPICALLY ISSUE TWO TYPES OF RATINGS FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES: CLAIMS-PAYING (OR FINANCIAL STRENGTH) RATINGS WHICH REFLECT THE RATING AGENCY'S ASSESSMENT OF AN INSURER'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL

OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND DEBT RATINGS WHICH REFLECT THE RATING AGENCY'S ASSESSMENT OF A COMPANY'S PROSPECTS FOR REPAYING ITS DEBTS AND ARE CONSIDERED BY LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTING

OF INTEREST RATES AND TERMS FOR A COMPANY'S SHORT- AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. AGENCY RATINGS ARE NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY, SELL OR HOLD ANY SECURITY, AND THEY MAY BE REVISED OR WITHDRAWN

AT ANY TIME BY THE RATING AGENCY. EACH AGENCY'S RATING SHOULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER AGENCY'S RATING. THE SYSTEM AND THE NUMBER OF RATING CATEGORIES CAN VARY WIDELY FROM RATING AGENCY

TO RATING AGENCY. CUSTOMERS USUALLY FOCUS ON CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS, WHILE CREDITORS FOCUS ON DEBT RATINGS. INVESTORS USE BOTH TO EVALUATE A COMPANY'S OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH. THE RATINGS ISSUED ON

THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES BY ANY OF THESE AGENCIES ARE ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY AND ARE AVAILABLE ON THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE AND FROM THE AGENCIES.

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A

DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS VOLUMES AND COMPETITIVE POSITION BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS

PRODUCTS MAY BE REDUCED, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE MANY CUSTOMERS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATINGS TO ENTER INTO OR RENEW BUSINESS WITH IT.

ADDITIONALLY,

A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS, INCLUDING IN

THE SYNDICATED BANK LOAN MARKET, AND/OR RESULT IN HIGHER FINANCING COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, DOWNGRADES IN THE COMPANY'S DEBT RATINGS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER THE COMPANY'S REVOLVING

CREDIT AGREEMENT (UNDER WHICH THE COST OF BORROWING COULD RANGE FROM LIBOR PLUS 100 BASIS POINTS TO LIBOR PLUS 175 BASIS POINTS, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S DEBT RATINGS), THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL

PAPER PROGRAM, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY WERE TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS BY ISSUING DEBT OR SIMILAR TYPES OF SECURITIES. SEE "ITEM 7"MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE

LEVEL OF INCREASED CASH FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN THE EVENT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE AS PART OF THE EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT A

ONE- TO TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN ITS DEBT RATINGS WOULD NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER ITS EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF A RATINGS DOWNGRADE AS PART OF THE EVALUATION OF ITS COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES.

INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

THE MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID TAXABLE U.S.

GOVERNMENT, TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL, AND TAXABLE CORPORATE AND U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND

INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES ARE EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FUNDS

AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT OF THE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS HISTORICALLY PRODUCED A DURATION THAT

EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES. RECENTLY, THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO OF FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM

SECURITY INVESTMENTS HAS DECLINED, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF DECLINING MARKET YIELDS AND TIGHTENING INVESTMENT SPREADS ON EXISTING HOLDINGS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (BOTH OF WHICH IMPACT THE

ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO OPTIONAL PRE-PAYMENTS), AN INCREASE IN PRE-REFUNDED MUNICIPAL BONDS AND GENERAL PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO RECENTLY EXPERIENCED

AN INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF ITS NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF DECLINING MARKET INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN WORKERS'

COMPENSATION INSURANCE BUSINESS VOLUME. AS A RESULT, THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES EXCEEDED THAT OF ITS PORTFOLIO OF FIXED MATURITY AND

SHORT-TERM SECURITY INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE BY WHICH THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE OF THE NET

INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUND CLAIM PAYMENTS WITHOUT

HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES.

THE

PRIMARY GOALS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETLIABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS ARE TO SATISFY THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER FLUCTUATIONS IN

PROJECTED LIABILITY CASH FLOWS. GENERALLY, THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO ADEQUATELY FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANY'S

INSURANCE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EXACT CASH FLOW MATCH IN EACH PERIOD, THE SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE BY WHICH THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE OF

THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS, PROVIDE ASSURANCE OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUND CLAIM

PAYMENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS ITS CREDIT FACILITIES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO INVESTS MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, REAL ESTATE, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND TRADING SECURITIES. THESE

INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT ALSO INVOLVE VARYING DEGREES OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND LESS LIQUIDITY.

SEE

NOTE 3 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

REGULATION

U.S. STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION

TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE VARIOUS STATES AND JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY TRANSACT BUSINESS. THE

EXTENT OF REGULATION VARIES, BUT GENERALLY DERIVES FROM STATUTES THAT DELEGATE REGULATORY, SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO A DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN EACH STATE. THE REGULATION,

SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION RELATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED, THE LICENSING OF INSURERS AND THEIR AGENTS, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON

INVESTMENTS, PREMIUM RATES, RESTRICTIONS ON THE SIZE OF RISKS THAT MAY BE INSURED UNDER A SINGLE POLICY, RESERVES AND PROVISIONS FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS, DEPOSITS OF

SECURITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF POLICYHOLDERS, APPROVAL OF POLICY FORMS AND THE REGULATION OF MARKET CONDUCT, INCLUDING THE USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION IN UNDERWRITING AS WELL AS OTHER UNDERWRITING AND

CLAIMS PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, MANY STATES HAVE ENACTED VARIATIONS OF COMPETITIVE RATEMAKING LAWS, WHICH ALLOW INSURERS TO SET CERTAIN PREMIUM RATES FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF INSURANCE WITHOUT HAVING TO

OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS ALSO CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND MARKET CONDUCT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

REQUIRE THE FILING OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER REPORTS ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS. TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE COLLECTIVELY LICENSED TO

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRANSACT

INSURANCE BUSINESS IN ALL U.S. STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, GUAM, PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.

ALTHOUGH

THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT HISTORICALLY REGULATED THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS FROM TIME TO TIME, INCLUDING AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2008 AND

2009, TO IMPOSE

FEDERAL REGULATION ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. ON JULY 21, 2010, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE

DODD-FRANK ACT). AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DODD-FRANK ACT ESTABLISHES A FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE WITHIN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. THE FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE

INITIALLY HAS LIMITED REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND IS EMPOWERED TO GATHER DATA AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND INSURERS, INCLUDING CONDUCTING A STUDY FOR SUBMISSION TO THE U.S.

CONGRESS ON HOW TO MODERNIZE AND IMPROVE INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE U.S. FURTHER, THE DODD-FRANK ACT GIVES THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL SERVICES

COMPANIES, INCLUDING INSURANCE COMPANIES, IF THEY ARE DESIGNATED BY A TWO-THIRDS VOTE OF A FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE COUNCIL) AS "SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT." WHILE THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT, AS DEFINED IN THE DODD-FRANK ACT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, THE COUNCIL MAY DISAGREE WITH THE COMPANY.

THE COUNCIL HAS RECENTLY ISSUED PROPOSED RULES THAT DO NOT RESOLVE THIS UNCERTAINTY. IF THE COMPANY WERE DESIGNATED AS SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY COULD INCLUDE

THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE HEIGHTENED FINANCIAL REGULATION AND COULD IMPACT REQUIREMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE AS WELL AS ITS BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT CONDUCT. AS A RESULT

OF THE FOREGOING, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, OR OTHER ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REGULATION THAT IS ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE, COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON THE COMPANY, INCLUDING IMPACTING THE WAYS IN

WHICH IT CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS, INCREASING COMPLIANCE COSTS AND DUPLICATING STATE REGULATION, AND COULD RESULT IN A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE.

INSURANCE REGULATION CONCERNING DIVIDENDS.

TRV'S PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT. THE

CONNECTICUT

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS REQUIRE NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND, THAT TOGETHER WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN

THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURER'S CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURER'S NET INCOME FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE

PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND BY STATE REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED

SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.

THE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE RESTRICTIVE,

LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

RATE AND RULE APPROVALS.

TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO EACH STATE'S LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING RATE AND RULE

APPROVALS. THE

APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE USED BY STATES TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT RATES ARE NOT EXCESSIVE, INADEQUATE, UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY OR USED TO ENGAGE IN UNFAIR PRICE COMPETITION. AN

INSURER'S ABILITY TO INCREASE RATES AND THE RELATIVE TIMING OF THE PROCESS ARE DEPENDENT UPON EACH RESPECTIVE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS.

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXITING GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS AND/OR CANCELING OR NONRENEWING POLICIES.

SEVERAL STATES HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH MAY

IMPACT THE

TIMING AND/OR THE ABILITY OF AN INSURER TO EITHER DISCONTINUE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE ITS WRITINGS IN THAT STATE. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TYPICALLY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE, AND IN SOME INSTANCES

INSURANCE DEPARTMENT APPROVAL, PRIOR TO DISCONTINUING A LINE OF BUSINESS OR WITHDRAWING FROM THAT STATE, AND THEY ALLOW INSURERS TO CANCEL OR NON-RENEW CERTAIN POLICIES ONLY FOR CERTAIN

SPECIFIED REASONS.

ASSESSMENTS FOR GUARANTY FUNDS AND SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY POOLING AND REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS.

VIRTUALLY ALL STATES

REQUIRE

INSURERS LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS IN THEIR STATE,

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCLUDING

TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, TO BEAR A PORTION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED BY SOME CLAIMANTS BECAUSE OF THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURERS. MANY STATES ALSO HAVE LAWS THAT ESTABLISH SECOND-INJURY

FUNDS TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO INJURED EMPLOYEES FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRIOR CONDITION OR INJURY.

TRV'S

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNED RISK POOLS, PRINCIPALLY INVOLVING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, PROPERTY

WINDPOOLS IN STATES PRONE TO PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM HURRICANES, AND FAIR PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE VARIOUS INSURANCE COVERAGES TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE THAT

COVERAGE IN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET.

ASSESSMENTS

MAY INCLUDE ANY CHARGE MANDATED BY STATUTE OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY THAT IS RELATED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES. EXAMPLES OF SUCH MECHANISMS INCLUDE, BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND, FLORIDA CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION, LOUISIANA CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION, AND THE TEXAS WINDSTORM INSURANCE

ASSOCIATION. AMOUNTS PAYABLE OR PAID AS A RESULT OF ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE IN SUBSTANCE REINSURANCE, INCLUDING CERTAIN INVOLUNTARY POOLS WHERE INSURERS ARE REQUIRED TO ASSUME PREMIUMS AND LOSSES FROM

THOSE POOLS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS REINSURANCE (E.G., NATIONAL WORKERS COMPENSATION REINSURANCE POOL, NORTH CAROLINA BEACH PLAN). AMOUNTS RELATED TO ASSESSMENTS FROM ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE NOT

REINSURANCE ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF "GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES." FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING ASSESSMENTS FOR GUARANTY FUNDS AND SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY

POOLING AND REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS INCLUDING STATE-FUNDING MECHANISMS, SEE ITEM 1A"RISK FACTORS."

INSURANCE REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM.

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) DEVELOPED THE INSURANCE REGULATORY

INFORMATION

SYSTEM (IRIS) TO HELP STATE REGULATORS IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION. FINANCIAL EXAMINERS REVIEW ANNUAL STATEMENTS AND KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS BASED ON YEAR-END DATA.

THESE RATIOS ASSIST STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS IN EXECUTING THEIR STATUTORY MANDATE TO OVERSEE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. EACH RATIO HAS AN ESTABLISHED "USUAL RANGE" OF RESULTS.

A RATIO RESULT FALLING OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE OF IRIS

RATIOS, HOWEVER, IS NOT CONSIDERED A FAILING RESULT; RATHER, UNUSUAL VALUES ARE VIEWED AS PART OF THE REGULATORY EARLY MONITORING SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, IN SOME YEARS, IT MAY NOT BE UNUSUAL FOR

FINANCIALLY SOUND COMPANIES TO HAVE SEVERAL RATIOS WITH RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES. GENERALLY, AN INSURANCE COMPANY WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY IF IT FALLS OUTSIDE THE USUAL

RANGES OF FOUR OR MORE OF THE RATIOS.

BASED

ON PRELIMINARY 2010 IRIS RATIOS CALCULATED BY THE COMPANY, THE FOLLOWING LEAD INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE DUE TO THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMPANY

DURING 2010 TO DIVIDEND EXCESS CAPITAL TO THE HOLDING COMPANY: THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE IRIS RATIO DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AND FOR THREE IRIS RATIOS DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS PAID TO ITS PARENT; TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY AND THE STANDARD FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL

RANGE FOR ONE IRIS RATIO DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND FOR TWO IRIS RATIOS DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS PAID TO ITS PARENT; AND ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE

INSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THREE IRIS RATIOS DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS PAID TO ITS PARENT.

IN

2009, TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE IRIS RATIO DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

MANAGEMENT

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE REGULATORY ACTION AS A RESULT OF THE 2010 IRIS RATIO RESULTS FOR THE LEAD INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES OR THEIR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. IN ALL INSTANCES IN PRIOR

YEARS, REGULATORS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED UPON FOLLOW-UP THAT NO REGULATORY ACTION WAS REQUIRED.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC) REQUIREMENTS.

THE NAIC HAS AN RBC REQUIREMENT FOR MOST PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE RBC

REQUIREMENT DETERMINES MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND

IS INTENDED TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS. UNDER LAWS ADOPTED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES, INSURERS HAVING TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED BY THE RBC

CALCULATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL INADEQUACY.

THE

FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE AMONG ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE TO

USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, ALL OF TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THE RBC REQUIREMENT.

INVESTMENT REGULATION.

INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTMENTS MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH PRESCRIBE THE KIND, QUALITY

AND

CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS. IN GENERAL, THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERMIT INVESTMENTS IN FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS, CORPORATE BONDS, PREFERRED AND COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES, MORTGAGE

LOANS, REAL ESTATE AND CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENTS, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED LIMITS AND CERTAIN OTHER QUALIFICATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS.

AGENT AND BROKER COMPENSATION.

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE COMPANY AND THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF NEW YORK, ILLINOIS AND CONNECTICUT AMENDED

AND RESTATED

EXISTING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY REGARDING PRODUCER COMPENSATION. THE AMENDMENTS DO NOT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF CONTINGENT COMMISSIONS AS PRODUCER COMPENSATION.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

TRV'S INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES BASED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED AND TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND

SURETY COMPANY OF EUROPE LIMITED, ARE REGULATED BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA). THE FSA'S PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES ARE TO MAINTAIN MARKET CONFIDENCE, PROMOTE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE

FINANCIAL SYSTEM, PROTECT CONSUMERS, AND FIGHT FINANCIAL CRIME. TRV'S MANAGING AGENT (TRAVELERS SYNDICATE MANAGEMENT LTD.) OF ITS LLOYD'S SYNDICATE IS ALSO REGULATED BY THE FSA, WHICH HAS

DELEGATED CERTAIN REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE COUNCIL OF LLOYD'S.

THROUGH

LLOYD'S, TRV IS LICENSED TO WRITE BUSINESS IN OVER 70 COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BY VIRTUE OF LLOYD'S INTERNATIONAL LICENSES. IN EACH SUCH COUNTRY, TRV IS SUBJECT TO THE LAWS

AND INSURANCE REGULATION OF THAT COUNTRY. A TRV SUBSIDIARY, TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY, HAS A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN CHINA. THE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IS REGULATED BY THE CHINA INSURANCE

REGULATORY COMMISSION. A TRV SUBSIDIARY, TCI GLOBAL SERVICES, INC., HAS A LIAISON OFFICE IN INDIA. INSURANCE BUSINESS IN INDIA IS REGULATED BY THE INSURANCE REGULATORY AND DEVELOPMENT

AUTHORITY. IN ADDITION, TRV'S LLOYD'S MANAGING AGENCY HAS A SERVICE COMPANY IN SINGAPORE, THE UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS OF WHICH ARE REGULATED BY THE MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE.

TRV'S

INSURANCE OPERATIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ARE REGULATED BY THE INSURANCE SUPERVISION DEPARTMENTS OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF IRELAND. SUCH OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH AN

IRISH BRANCH OF TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED WHICH, AS MENTIONED ABOVE, IS REGULATED BY THE FSA. IN CANADA, THE CONDUCT OF TRV'S INSURANCE BUSINESS IS REGULATED BY THE OFFICE OF THE

SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT, WHICH REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVELS OF CAPITAL DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF

INSURANCE POLICIES IN FORCE.

THE

EUROPEAN UNION'S EXECUTIVE BODY, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, IS IMPLEMENTING NEW CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND RISK MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS CALLED SOLVENCY II THAT WOULD APPLY TO THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESSES ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION BEGINNING AS SOON AS THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. UNDER SOLVENCY II, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE U.S. PARENT OF A EUROPEAN UNION SUBSIDIARY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

SOLVENCY II REQUIREMENTS IF THE REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT THE SUBSIDIARY'S CAPITAL POSITION IS DEPENDENT ON THE PARENT COMPANY AND THE U.S. COMPANY IS NOT ALREADY SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS DEEMED

"EQUIVALENT" TO SOLVENCY II. IN ADDITION, REGULATORS IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY HAS OPERATIONS ARE WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS (AND IN THE U.S., WITH THE

NATIONAL

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSOCIATION

OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS) TO CONSIDER CHANGES TO INSURANCE COMPANY SUPERVISION, INCLUDING SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS AND GROUP SUPERVISION. WHILE IT IS NOT CERTAIN HOW OR IF THESE ACTIONS

WILL IMPACT THE COMPANY, IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR ITS U.S. OPERATING COMPANIES OR ITS EUROPEAN UNION OPERATING COMPANIES WILL BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, TRV IS NOT REGULATED AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. HOWEVER, SINCE TRV OWNS CAPITAL STOCK IN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, IT

IS SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER LAWS, OF EACH OF ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES' STATES OF DOMICILE. ALL HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS OTHER LAWS,

REQUIRE DISCLOSURE AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, PRIOR APPROVAL OF MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND AN AFFILIATE. THE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES AND OTHER LAWS ALSO REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PRIOR APPROVAL OF AN ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF A DOMESTIC INSURER, SOME TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AFFILIATES AND THE PAYMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS.

INSURANCE REGULATIONS CONCERNING CHANGE OF CONTROL.

MANY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY LAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE ADVANCE

APPROVAL BY STATE

AGENCIES OF ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT IS DOMICILED, OR, IN SOME CASES, HAVING SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS THAT IT IS DEEMED TO BE COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED, IN THAT STATE.

THE

LAWS OF MANY STATES ALSO CONTAIN PROVISIONS REQUIRING PRE-NOTIFICATION TO STATE AGENCIES PRIOR TO ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF A NON-DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY

ADMITTED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN THAT STATE. WHILE THESE PRE-NOTIFICATION STATUTES DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE STATE AGENCY TO DISAPPROVE THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, THEY DO AUTHORIZE ISSUANCE OF

CEASE AND DESIST

ORDERS WITH RESPECT TO THE NON-DOMESTIC INSURER IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT SOME CONDITIONS, SUCH AS UNDUE MARKET CONCENTRATION, WOULD RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION.

ANY

TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF ANY OF TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD GENERALLY REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATES IN

WHICH THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED OR COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED. THEY MAY ALSO REQUIRE PRE-ACQUISITION NOTIFICATION IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED PRE-ACQUISITION

NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS AND IN WHICH SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ADMITTED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS.

TWO

OF TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND ITS OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S ARE DOMICILED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. INSURERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES AND MARKETS ACT OF 2000 INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. SOME OF TRV'S OTHER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN, OR AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT INSURANCE

BUSINESS IN, CANADA. AUTHORIZED INSURERS IN CANADA ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 407 OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT, INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE OFFICE OF THE

SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THESE

REQUIREMENTS MAY DETER, DELAY OR PREVENT TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING THE CONTROL OF OR THE OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO TRV'S

SHAREHOLDERS.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

AS A LARGE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE ENTERPRISE, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO MANY RISKS. THESE RISKS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE

ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. SINCE CERTAIN RISKS CAN BE CORRELATED WITH OTHER RISKS, AN EVENT OR A SERIES OF EVENTS CAN IMPACT MULTIPLE AREAS OF THE COMPANY SIMULTANEOUSLY AND HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY. THESE EXPOSURES REQUIRE AN ENTITY-WIDE VIEW OF RISK AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE POTENTIAL

IMPACT ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MANAGE ITS RISK-TAKING TO BE WITHIN ITS RISK APPETITE IN A PRUDENT AND BALANCED EFFORT TO CREATE AND PRESERVE VALUE

FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S STAKEHOLDERS. THIS APPROACH TO COMPANY-WIDE RISK EVALUATION AND

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENT

IS COMMONLY CALLED ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM). ERM ACTIVITIES INVOLVE BOTH THE IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF A BROAD RANGE OF RISKS AND THE EXECUTION OF SYNCHRONIZED STRATEGIES TO

EFFECTIVELY MANAGE SUCH RISKS. EFFECTIVE ERM ALSO INCLUDES THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANY'S RISK CAPITAL NEEDS, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND CREDIT RATING CONSIDERATIONS, IN

ADDITION TO ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.

ERM

AT THE COMPANY IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS. ALL RISK OWNERS ACROSS ALL FUNCTIONS, ALL CORPORATE LEADERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE ENGAGED IN ERM. ERM INVOLVES

RISK-BASED ANALYTICS, AS WELL AS REPORTING AND FEEDBACK THROUGHOUT THE ENTERPRISE IN SUPPORT OF THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES.

THE

COMPANY USES VARIOUS METHODS, INCLUDING SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. THESE ANALYSES AND METHODS ARE

USED IN MAKING UNDERWRITING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS AS PART OF MANAGING THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IN ADDITION TO CATASTROPHE MODELING AND ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY ALSO MODELS AND

ANALYZES ITS EXPOSURE TO OTHER EXTREME EVENTS. THESE ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES ARE AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THE COMPANY'S ERM PROCESS AND FURTHER SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL

STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES.

IN

ADDITION TO THE DAY-TO-DAY ERM ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS UNITS, OTHER KEY INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

(COMPRISED OF THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE OTHER MOST SENIOR MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT), THE ENTERPRISE AND UNDERWRITING RISK COMMITTEES OF MANAGEMENT, THE CREDIT COMMITTEE, THE CHIEF

COMPLIANCE OFFICER, THE BUSINESS CONDUCT OFFICER, THE CORPORATE ACTUARIAL GROUP, THE CORPORATE AUDIT GROUP, THE ACCOUNTING POLICY GROUP, THE ENTERPRISE UNDERWRITING GROUP AND MANY OTHERS. A SENIOR

EXECUTIVE OVERSEES THE ERM PROCESS. THE MISSION OF THIS EXECUTIVE IS TO FACILITATE RISK ASSESSMENT AND TO COLLABORATE IN IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY.

ANOTHER STRATEGIC ERM OBJECTIVE OF THIS EXECUTIVE INCLUDES WORKING ACROSS THE COMPANY TO ENHANCE EFFECTIVE AND REALISTIC RISK MODELING CAPABILITIES AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S OVERALL EFFORT TO

UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE ITS PORTFOLIO OF RISKS TO BE WITHIN ITS RISK APPETITE. BOARD OVERSIGHT OF ERM IS PROVIDED BY THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH REVIEWS THE STRATEGIES, PROCESSES

AND CONTROLS PERTAINING TO THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND OVERSEES THE IMPLEMENTATION, EXECUTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY'S ERM PROGRAM.

THE

COMPANY'S ERM EFFORTS BUILD UPON THE FOUNDATION OF AN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT. ERM EXPANDS THE INTERNAL CONTROL OBJECTIVES OF EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT OPERATIONS,

RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, TO FOSTERING, LEADING AND SUPPORTING AN INTEGRATED, RISK-BASED CULTURE WITHIN THE COMPANY THAT FOCUSES ON

VALUE CREATION AND PRESERVATION. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF ANY RISK MANAGEMENT OR CONTROL

SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. AS A RESULT, THE POSSIBILITY OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS REMAINS IN SPITE

OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ERM EFFORTS. AN INVESTOR SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING THE DISCUSSIONS INCLUDED IN

"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS," "ITEM 7AQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK," AND "ITEM 8FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA."

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOSSARY OF SELECTED INSURANCE TERMS

ACCIDENT YEAR

THE ANNUAL CALENDAR ACCOUNTING PERIOD IN WHICH LOSS EVENTS OCCURRED, REGARDLESS OF WHEN THE LOSSES ARE ACTUALLY REPORTED, BOOKED OR PAID.

ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS

UNASSIGNED SURPLUS AS OF THE MOST RECENT STATUTORY ANNUAL REPORT REDUCED BY TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THAT YEAR'S

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION IN VALUE OR REVALUATION OF ASSETS OR UNREALIZED PROFITS ON INVESTMENTS, AS DEFINED IN THAT REPORT.

ADMITTED INSURER

A COMPANY LICENSED TO TRANSACT INSURANCE BUSINESS WITHIN A STATE.

ANNUITY

A CONTRACT THAT PAYS A PERIODIC BENEFIT OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF A PERSON (THE ANNUITANT), THE LIVES OF TWO OR

MORE PERSONS OR FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME.

ASSIGNED RISK POOLS

REINSURANCE POOLS WHICH COVER RISKS FOR THOSE UNABLE TO PURCHASE INSURANCE IN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. POSSIBLE

REASONS FOR THIS INABILITY INCLUDE THE RISK BEING TOO GREAT OR THE PROFIT BEING TOO SMALL UNDER THE REQUIRED INSURANCE RATE STRUCTURE. THE COSTS OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE POOLS ARE CHARGED BACK TO INSURANCE CARRIERS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR

DIRECT WRITINGS.

ASSUMED REINSURANCE

INSURANCE RISKS ACQUIRED FROM A CEDING COMPANY.

AVERAGE VALUE ANALYSIS

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD USED TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT

YEAR/PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID LOSSES.

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT AVERAGE CLAIM VALUES ARE STABLE AND PREDICTABLE OVER TIME FOR A

PARTICULAR COHORT OF CLAIMS. THE METHOD IS UTILIZED MOST OFTEN WHERE ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS ARE KNOWN OR RELIABLY ESTIMABLE FAIRLY EARLY AFTER THE START OF AN ACCIDENT YEAR AND AVERAGE VALUES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE FROM ONE YEAR TO THE

NEXT.

THE METHOD COMES UP WITH AN ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS COUNTS BY ACCIDENT YEAR COHORT, AND MULTIPLIES IT BY AN

ESTIMATE OF AVERAGE CLAIM VALUE BY ACCIDENT YEAR COHORT, WITH MULTIPLE METHODS USED TO ESTIMATE THESE AVERAGE CLAIM VALUES.

BOOK VALUE PER SHARE

TOTAL COMMON SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING.

BORNHUETTER-FERGUSON METHOD

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT

LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE OUTSTANDING LOSSES.

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT THE HISTORICAL RATIO OF ADDITIONAL CLAIM ACTIVITY TO EARNED PREMIUM FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT

LINE COMPONENT/AGE-TO-AGE PERIOD IS STABLE AND PREDICTABLE. IT IMPLICITLY ASSUMES THAT THE ACTUAL ACTIVITY TO DATE FOR PAST PERIODS FOR THAT COHORT IS NOT A CREDIBLE PREDICTOR OF FUTURE ACTIVITY FOR THAT COHORT, OR AT LEAST IS NOT CREDIBLE ENOUGH TO

OVERRIDE THE "A PRIORI" ASSUMPTION AS TO FUTURE ACTIVITY. IT MAY BE APPLIED TO EITHER PAID OR CASE INCURRED CLAIM DATA. IT IS USED MOST OFTEN WHERE THE CLAIM DATA IS SPARSE AND/OR VOLATILE AND FOR RELATIVELY YOUNG COHORTS WITH LOW VOLUMES AND/OR DATA

CREDIBILITY.

TO ILLUSTRATE, THE METHOD MAY ASSUME THAT THE RATIO OF ADDITIONAL PAID LOSSES FROM THE 12 TO 24 MONTH

PERIOD FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR IS 10% OF THE ORIGINAL "A PRIORI" EXPECTED LOSSES FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR. THE ORIGINAL "A PRIORI" EXPECTED LOSSES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON THE ORIGINAL LOSS RATIO ASSUMPTION FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR, WITH SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENT

AS FACTS DEVELOP.

THE ULTIMATE LOSSES EQUAL ACTUAL ACTIVITY TO DATE PLUS THE EXPECTED VALUES FOR FUTURE PERIODS.

BROKER

ONE WHO NEGOTIATES CONTRACTS OF INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE ON BEHALF OF AN INSURED PARTY, RECEIVING A COMMISSION

FROM THE INSURER OR REINSURER FOR PLACEMENT AND OTHER SERVICES RENDERED.

CAPACITY

THE PERCENTAGE OF SURPLUS, OR THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE, THAT AN INSURER OR REINSURER IS WILLING OR ABLE TO

PLACE AT RISK. CAPACITY MAY APPLY TO A SINGLE RISK, A PROGRAM, A LINE OF BUSINESS OR AN ENTIRE BOOK OF BUSINESS. CAPACITY MAY BE CONSTRAINED BY LEGAL RESTRICTIONS, CORPORATE RESTRICTIONS OR INDIRECT RESTRICTIONS.

CAPTIVE

A CLOSELY-HELD INSURANCE COMPANY WHOSE PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THE COMPANY'S OWNERS

OR THEIR AFFILIATES.

CASE-INCURRED DEVELOPMENT METHOD

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT

LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID LOSSES.

THE APPROACH IS THE SAME AS THAT DESCRIBED IN THIS GLOSSARY UNDER THE "PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD," BUT BASED

ON THE GROWTH IN CUMULATIVE CASE-INCURRED LOSSES (I.E., THE SUM OF CLAIM-ADJUSTOR INCURRED ESTIMATES FOR CLAIMS IN THE COHORT) RATHER THAN PAID LOSSES. THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT CUMULATIVE CASE INCURRED LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF

CLAIMS WILL GROW IN A STABLE, PREDICTABLE PATTERN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR, BASED ON THE AGE OF THE COHORT.

CASE RESERVES

CLAIM DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE PAYMENTS TO BE MADE ON EACH SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL REPORTED

CLAIM.

37

DEFICIENCY

WITH REGARD TO RESERVES FOR A GIVEN LIABILITY, A DEFICIENCY EXISTS WHEN IT IS ESTIMATED OR DETERMINED THAT THE

RESERVES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT VALUE OF THE RELATED LIABILITIES. WHERE THE DEFICIENCY IS THE RESULT OF AN ESTIMATE, THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF DEFICIENCY (OR EVEN THE FINDING OF WHETHER OR NOT A DEFICIENCY EXISTS) MAY CHANGE AS

EMPLOYEE. SURETY IS A THREE-PARTY AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE INSURER AGREES TO PAY A THIRD PARTY OR MAKE COMPLETE AN OBLIGATION IN RESPONSE TO THE DEFAULT, ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF AN INSURED.

GAAP COMBINED RATIO

THE SUM OF THE LOSS AND LAE RATIO, THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE RATIO OF DIVIDENDS

TO POLICYHOLDERS TO NET PREMIUMS EARNED. A COMBINED RATIO UNDER 100% GENERALLY INDICATES AN UNDERWRITING PROFIT. A COMBINED RATIO OVER 100% GENERALLY INDICATES AN UNDERWRITING LOSS.

GAAP COMBINED RATIO EXCLUDING INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE

THE GAAP COMBINED RATIO ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE DIRECT, VARIABLE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

INITIATIVE IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT.

GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS

THE DIRECT AND ASSUMED CONTRACTUALLY DETERMINED AMOUNTS CHARGED TO THE POLICYHOLDERS FOR THE EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF

THE CONTRACT BASED ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE INSURANCE CONTRACT.

GROUND-UP ANALYSIS

A METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT LINE

COMPONENT. IT INVOLVES ANALYZING THE EXPOSURE AT AN INDIVIDUAL INSURED LEVEL AND THEN THROUGH THE USE OF DETERMINISTIC OR STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS AND/OR SIMULATIONS, ESTIMATING THE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR THOSE INSUREDS. THE TOTAL LOSSES FOR THE COHORT ARE

THEN THE SUM OF THE LOSSES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL INSURED.

IN PRACTICE, THE METHOD IS SOMETIMES SIMPLIFIED BY PERFORMING THE INDIVIDUAL INSURED ANALYSIS ONLY FOR THE

LARGER INSUREDS, WITH THE COSTS FOR THE SMALLER INSUREDS ESTIMATED VIA SAMPLING APPROACHES (EXTRAPOLATED TO THE REST OF THE SMALLER INSURED POPULATION) OR AGGREGATE APPROACHES (USING ASSUMPTIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE GROUND-UP LARGER INSURED

ANALYSIS).

GUARANTEED COST PRODUCTS

AN INSURANCE POLICY WHERE THE PREMIUMS CHARGED WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DURING THE

COVERED PERIOD.

GUARANTY FUND

PAID DEVELOPMENT METHOD

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT

LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID LOSSES.

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT CUMULATIVE PAID LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS WILL GROW IN A

STABLE, PREDICTABLE PATTERN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR, BASED ON THE AGE OF THE COHORT. THESE AGE-TO-AGE GROWTH FACTORS ARE SOMETIMES CALLED "LINK RATIOS."

FOR EXAMPLE, IF CUMULATIVE PAID LOSSES FOR A PRODUCT LINE XYZ FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2004 WERE $100 AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004 (12 MONTHS AFTER THE START OF THAT ACCIDENT YEAR), THEN GREW TO $120 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 (24 MONTHS AFTER THE START), THE LINK RATIO FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR FROM 12 TO 24 MONTHS WOULD BE 1.20. IF THE LINK

RATIO FOR OTHER RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS FROM 12 TO 24 MONTHS FOR THAT PRODUCT LINE WERE ALSO AT OR AROUND 1.20, THEN THE METHOD WOULD ASSUME A SIMILAR RESULT FOR THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR, I.E., THAT IT TOO WOULD HAVE ITS CUMULATIVE PAID

LOSSES GROW 120% FROM THE 12 MONTH TO 24 MONTH VALUATION.

THIS IS REPEATED FOR EACH AGE-TO-AGE PERIOD INTO THE FUTURE UNTIL THE AGE-TO-AGE LINK RATIOS FOR FUTURE PERIODS

ARE ASSUMED TO BE 1.0 (I.E., THE AGE AT WHICH CUMULATIVE LOSSES ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE STOPPED GROWING).

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR'S CUMULATIVE LOSSES ARE THEN PROJECTED TO ULTIMATE BY MULTIPLYING CURRENT CUMULATIVE LOSSES BY SUCCESSIVE

AGE-TO-AGE LINK RATIOS UP TO THAT FUTURE AGE WHERE GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO END. FOR EXAMPLE, IF GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO END AT 60 MONTHS, THEN THE ULTIMATE INDICATION FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR WITH CUMULATIVE LOSSES AT 12 MONTHS EQUALS THOSE LOSSES

TIMES A 12 TO 24 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A 24 TO 36 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A 36 TO 48 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A 48 TO 60 MONTH LINK RATIO.

ADVANCED APPLICATIONS OF THE METHOD INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGING CONDITIONS DURING THE HISTORICAL PERIOD AND

ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE FUTURE.

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO

RAISE

CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE.

OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES

CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HURRICANES AND OTHER WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. CATASTROPHES CAN

ALSO BE MAN-MADE, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS), EXPLOSIONS, INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES OR A CONSEQUENCE OF

POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR BUSINESS SUBJECTS US

TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: HURRICANES FROM MAINE THROUGH TEXAS; TORNADOES THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES; EARTHQUAKES IN

CALIFORNIA, THE NEW MADRID REGION AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES; WILDFIRES, PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHWEST; AND TERRORISM IN MAJOR CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, AS WELL AS TO A VARIETY OF WORLD-WIDE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES THROUGH

OUR LLOYD'S OPERATIONS.

THE

INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL AND MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS

COULD INCREASE. SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT IN RECENT YEARS CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS HAVE ADDED TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND FREQUENCY OF NATURAL DISASTERS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

HURRICANES, TORNADOES, OTHER STORMS AND FIRES) IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD AND CREATED ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO FUTURE TRENDS AND EXPOSURES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN RECENT YEARS HURRICANE ACTIVITY HAS

IMPACTED AREAS FURTHER INLAND THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED, THUS EXPANDING OUR OVERALL HURRICANE EXPOSURE. THE CATASTROPHE MODELING TOOLS THAT WE USE, OR THAT WE RELY ON FROM OUTSIDE PARTIES, TO HELP

MANAGE CERTAIN OF OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ERROR AND MIS-ESTIMATION AND MAY PRODUCE ESTIMATES THAT ARE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN

ACTUAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, OUR INCREASED PRESENCE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, SUCH AS IN THE MIDWEST AND WESTERN REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES, AND ANY CHANGES IN CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD CAUSE OUR

DATA TO BE MORE LIMITED AND OUR CATASTROPHE MODELS TO BE EVEN LESS PREDICTIVE, THUS LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE AND MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING" AND "CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS."

THE

EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. INCREASES IN THE VALUE

AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION OF INSURED PROPERTY AND THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION COULD INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF CLAIMS FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, STATES HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME

PASSED LEGISLATION, AND REGULATORS HAVE TAKEN ACTION, THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK, SUCH AS LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS FROM REDUCING

EXPOSURES OR WITHDRAWING FROM CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS OR MANDATING THAT INSURERS PARTICIPATE IN RESIDUAL MARKETS. PARTICIPATION IN RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS HAS RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO

RESULT IN, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS TO INSURERS, INCLUDING US, AND, IN CERTAIN STATES, THOSE LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH OUR DIRECT CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE IN THOSE

STATES. IF OUR COMPETITORS LEAVE THOSE STATES HAVING RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS, REMAINING INSURERS, INCLUDING US, MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS FOLLOWING A

CATASTROPHE. IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES AND COURT DECISIONS WHICH SEEK TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL

INTENT OF THE POLICIES. ALSO, OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICING TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO OFFSET RISING COSTS OF CATASTROPHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, REQUIRES APPROVAL OF

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN STATES. OUR ABILITY OR OUR

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WILLINGNESS

TO MANAGE OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE BY RAISING PRICES, MODIFYING UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCING EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE

EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CHANGES IN THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND/OR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

WE ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IN CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS THAT WE MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING OUR ACCESS TO OTHER UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES.

THERE

ARE ALSO RISKS THAT IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY TO

ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE

RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL

LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE; BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTABILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S

OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES

ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

EXPOSURE

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS AND COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE

CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE, RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RATINGS. A RATINGS DOWNGRADE COULD HURT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS. IN ADDITION,

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD CAUSE US TO EXHAUST OUR AVAILABLE REINSURANCE LIMITS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE. SUCH EVENTS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE CREDIT OF OUR

REINSURERS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE, SEE "ITEM 1BUSINESSREINSURANCECATASTROPHE REINSURANCE." CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD

ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE CREDIT OF THE ISSUERS OF SECURITIES, SUCH AS STATES OR MUNICIPALITIES, IN WHOM WE HAVE INVESTED.

IN

ADDITION, COVERAGE IN OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR TERRORISM IS LIMITED. ALTHOUGH THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 (THE ACT) PROVIDES BENEFITS IN THE

EVENT OF CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM, THOSE BENEFITS ARE SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS. UNDER THIS LAW, ONCE OUR LOSSES EXCEED 20% OF OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

PREMIUM FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE US FOR 85% OF OUR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM WHICH EXCEED THIS DEDUCTIBLE UP TO A TOTAL INDUSTRY

PROGRAM CAP OF $100 BILLION. OUR ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM IS $2.08 BILLION FOR 2011. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS LAW IS UNTESTED, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL

UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW IT WILL BE APPLIED TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ACTION COULD CHANGE THE ACT.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS OR MAN-MADE EVENTS SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK, INCLUDING "UNCONVENTIONAL"

ACTS OF TERRORISM INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY. FURTHER, WHILE

WE SEEK TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL MEANS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING

OUT OF ONE OR MORE MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING SO-CALLED WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, INCLUDING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL MEANS.

DURING OR FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION OR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OVER THE

PAST THREE YEARS, WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS AND THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER ECONOMIES EXPERIENCED A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, RESULTING IN HEIGHTENED

CREDIT RISK, REDUCED VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND

DECREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. WHILE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE RECENTLY IMPROVED, THERE IS CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING AND STRENGTH OF ANY ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THE TREND MAY NOT

CONTINUE. EVEN IF GROWTH CONTINUES, IT MAY BE AT A SLOW RATE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS THE RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ENVIRONMENT AND EMPLOYMENT

RATES, MAY CONTINUE TO BE WEAK. IN ADDITION, SOME ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT STEPS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STABILIZE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND IMPROVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO AN

INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT. FURTHERMORE, FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY AGAIN EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION.

IF

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REMAIN WEAK OR DETERIORATE, OR IF FINANCIAL MARKETS EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION, IT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY. SEVERAL OF THE RISK FACTORS THAT FOLLOW IDENTIFY RISKS THAT RESULT FROM, OR ARE EXACERBATED BY, AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN OR FINANCIAL DISRUPTION. THESE INCLUDE RISKS DISCUSSED

BELOW RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS, OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES, OUR ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION", PARTICULARLY THE "OUTLOOK" SECTION.

MANY

OF THESE RISKS COULD MATERIALIZE, AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED, EVEN AFTER THE END OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR FINANCIAL DISRUPTION. DURING OR FOLLOWING AN

ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, LOWER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD REDUCE (AND HISTORICALLY HAVE REDUCED) EXPOSURE CHANGES AT RENEWAL. THEY ALSO COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT (AND HISTORICALLY HAVE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED) AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, POLICY ENDORSEMENTS AND MID-TERM CANCELLATIONS AFTER POLICIES ARE WRITTEN, PARTICULARLY IN OUR BUSINESS UNITS WITHIN BUSINESS INSURANCE, WHICH COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR WRITTEN PREMIUMS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE EARNED PREMIUMS LAG WRITTEN PREMIUMS, OUR RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AFTER GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED. AN INFLATIONARY

ENVIRONMENT (WHICH MAY FOLLOW GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY) MAY ALSO, AS WE DISCUSS BELOW, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LOSS COSTS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO. FINALLY, AS A RESULT OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, WE MAY, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, FACE INCREASED REGULATION.

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED OUR LOSS RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF LOSS RESERVES ARE NECESSARY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED

BUT NOT YET REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES,

AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON OUR

ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEWS OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF

LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS,

SUCH AS: CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES; ADVERSE CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS, INCLUDING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ON MEDICAL COSTS AND AUTO AND HOME REPAIR COSTS; ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING

GENERAL INFLATION; LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES; AND VARYING JUDGMENTS AND VIEWPOINTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON

ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY,

THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LAGS

(THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, SOME ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT STEPS TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY COULD LEAD TO AN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT, WHICH COULD IN TURN, LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OUR LOSS COSTS. THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON LOSS COSTS COULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED FOR THOSE

LINES OF BUSINESS THAT ARE CONSIDERED "LONG TAIL", SUCH AS GENERAL LIABILITY, AS THEY REQUIRE A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. CHANGES IN THE

LEVEL OF INFLATION ALSO RESULT IN AN INCREASED LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY IN OUR ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES, PARTICULARLY FOR LONG TAIL LINES OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN MEDICAL

COSTS MAY BE INCREASED BY THE RECENT HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION. THE ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES MAY ALSO BE MORE DIFFICULT DURING TIMES OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DUE TO UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN

BEHAVIOR OF CLAIMANTS AND POLICYHOLDERS, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT REPORTING OF EXPOSURES AND/OR LOSSES, REDUCED MAINTENANCE OF INSURED PROPERTIES OR INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SMALL CLAIMS.

WE

CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR, ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS, ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED AND THE LEGAL,

REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT EVOLVES. BUSINESS JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND

ANALYSES. DIFFERENT EXPERTS MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF FOCUS. HENCE, SUCH

EXPERTS MAY AT TIMES PRODUCE ESTIMATES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. THIS RISK MAY BE EXACERBATED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACQUISITION. EXPERTS PROVIDING INPUT TO THE VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE ACTUARIES, UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS

PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES.

WE

ATTEMPT TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME LOSS RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED OR REVIEWED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING LOSS RESERVE

ESTIMATES, THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WILL LIKELY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RELATED LOSS RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE,

ACTUAL PAID LOSSES IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN IS CURRENTLY RESERVED.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM ONE INSURED EVENT, OR AN ACCUMULATION OF INSURED EVENTS, MAY EXCEED THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN

ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

FOR

A DISCUSSION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES BY PRODUCT LINE, INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF COMMON FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT REQUIRED RESERVES, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES."

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR MATERIAL REALIZED OR UNREALIZED LOSSES.

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART

OF OUR

OVERALL PROFITABILITY. FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 94% OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES CAUSED BY INFLATION OR OTHER FACTORS (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS) AFFECT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS ON OUR FIXED MATURITY AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND NEW FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, THEREBY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR

NET INVESTMENT INCOME, WHILE RISING INTEREST RATES REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. AFTER A PERIOD OF HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES, LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES HAVE

RECENTLY RISEN SOMEWHAT. HOWEVER, INTEREST RATES MAY REMAIN AT LEVELS BELOW HISTORICAL AVERAGES, POSSIBLY FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD. DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS COULD BE SUBJECT TO HIGHER

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK

OF DEFAULT. THE VALUE OF OUR FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MAY DEFAULT OR BECOME IMPAIRED DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR PORTFOLIO, OR DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN INSURER THAT GUARANTEES AN ISSUER'S PAYMENTS OF SUCH

INVESTMENTS. SUCH DEFAULTS AND IMPAIRMENTS COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES.

WE

INVEST A PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY IN

THEIR INVESTMENT RETURNS

THAN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR NON-FIXED

MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND THE REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME, AND/OR RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY REALIZE REDUCED RETURNS ON THESE INVESTMENTS, WE

MAY INCUR LOSSES ON SALES OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT

LOSSES.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASED VALUATION UNCERTAINTIES WHEN INVESTMENT MARKETS ARE ILLIQUID. THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE

ILLIQUID, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (I.E., THE CARRYING AMOUNT) OF THE PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AS REFLECTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF PRICES AT WHICH ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS COULD OCCUR.

OUR

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED, IN SUBSTANTIAL PART, IN OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL

BOND PORTFOLIO). NOTWITHSTANDING THE RELATIVELY LOW HISTORICAL RATES OF DEFAULT ON MANY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT WE TYPICALLY SEEK TO INVEST IN HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY SECURITIES

(INCLUDING THOSE WITH STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS SUCH AS BEING SECURED BY DEDICATED OR PLEDGED SOURCES OF REVENUE), DURING OR FOLLOWING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO COULD BE SUBJECT

TO A HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT OR IMPAIRMENT DUE TO DECLINING MUNICIPAL TAX BASES AND REVENUE. THE PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT BEGAN IN 2008 HAS RESULTED IN MANY STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

OPERATING UNDER DEFICITS OR PROJECTED DEFICITS. THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THESE DEFICITS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION OF OUR MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO. IN

ADDITION, SOME ISSUERS MAY BE UNWILLING TO INCREASE TAX RATES, OR TO REDUCE SPENDING, TO FUND INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THEIR MUNICIPAL BONDS, OR MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MUNICIPAL BOND

MARKET TO FUND SUCH PAYMENTS. THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD DEFAULTS MAY INCREASE IF SOME ISSUERS VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO DEFAULT, INSTEAD OF IMPLEMENTING DIFFICULT FISCAL MEASURES, AND THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED

CONSEQUENCES (SUCH AS REDUCED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS) ARE LESS SEVERE THAN EXPECTED. THE RISK MAY ALSO INCREASE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN LEGISLATION THAT PERMIT STATES, OR ADDITIONAL MUNICIPALITIES

AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION OR IF THERE ARE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS THAT, IN A BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER PROCEEDING, LESSEN THE VALUE OF STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS. OUR

PORTFOLIO HAS ALSO BENEFITED FROM TAX EXEMPTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE GOVERNING DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH AS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS).

FEDERAL AND/OR STATE TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED IN CONNECTION WITH DEFICIT REDUCTION OR VARIOUS TYPES OF FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM THAT WOULD LESSEN OR ELIMINATE SOME OR ALL OF THE TAX ADVANTAGES

CURRENTLY BENEFITING US AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS, PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES, AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES; COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; AND WHOLLY-OWNED REAL ESTATE, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS AND MORTGAGE LOANS, ALL OF WHICH COULD BE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED BY FURTHER DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUATIONS AND/OR FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION. IN ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL FOR PROTRACTED DISRUPTION AND/OR SUSPENSION OF FORECLOSURE PRACTICES COULD ALSO

IMPACT THE RETURNS ON CERTAIN OF THESE PORTFOLIOS.

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE REALIZED AND/OR

UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY.

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BECAUSE OF OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS

THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED

TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN NEW ASBESTOS CLAIMS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE

CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM OUR POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY), INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST OUR POLICYHOLDERS BY INDIVIDUALS

WHO DO NOT APPEAR TO BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE. FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS AND THE FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON

PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. THE FOCUS ON THESE DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IN

ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES BY INITIALLY DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY

SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING US. THE BANKRUPTCY OF MANY TRADITIONAL DEFENDANTS HAS ALSO CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE

POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR

INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET.

THIS TREND OF PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS WE

HAVE EXPERIENCED. OUR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE EXPERIENCE ALSO HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS,

WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS.

WE

CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A PORTION

OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED AS A

SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDER'S FAVOR AND OUR

OTHER DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND

BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN A MODERATION IN THE

OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

MANY

COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO US BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN ORIGINALLY

ANTICIPATED. THERE ALSO MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE A COURT MAY NOT APPROVE A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FOR US. AS IN THE PAST,

WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN

ADDITION TO CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO THE

HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES.

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE

ANTICIPATE THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE

ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THESE CLAIMS AND HAVE RECEIVED FAVORABLE RULINGS IN CERTAIN

JURISDICTIONS.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE

ARISING OUT OF THEIR

ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO

RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN

REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

WE

HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. WE BELIEVE THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS HAVE INTERPRETED THE

INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY US PRIOR TO THE

MID-1980S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT BY

THE CLAIMANT FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND WE DO NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT

TO DETERMINE THE

ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE

CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS

PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE, AND/OR THE NUMBER OF, ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA

OR EXCESS POLICIES WE HAVE ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH OUR

PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST US, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS. IN

ADDITION, UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT

AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS ENVIRONMENT COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION AND FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND

INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR JUDICIAL REFORMS ESTABLISHING MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE

ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS

IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE.

WHILE

THE ONGOING EVALUATION OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN

LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO, AND MAY FACE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING, MASS TORT CLAIMS SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR

SUBSTANCES.

IN ADDITION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO OTHER TYPES OF MASS TORT CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING LEAD PAINT, SILICA AND WELDING ROD FUMES. ESTABLISHING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MASS TORT CLAIMS IS SUBJECT TO

UNCERTAINTIES BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, DISPUTES CONCERNING MEDICAL CAUSATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DISEASES, GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION OF THE LAWSUITS

ASSERTING

THE CLAIMS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE RISE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS WITHOUT UNDERLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN DISEASE RATES. MOREOVER, EVOLVING JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS TORT THEORIES AND DEFENSES, INCLUDING APPLICATION OF VARIOUS THEORIES OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF INSURANCE

COVERAGE TO THESE CLAIMS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE, AND SUCH CHANGE COULD BE MATERIAL. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

AS INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL, JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND

OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIM AND COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY EITHER EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OUR

UNDERWRITING INTENT OR BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF CLAIMS. EXAMPLES OF EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.



JUDICIAL EXPANSION OF POLICY COVERAGE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY;



PLAINTIFFS TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATING TO

CLAIMS-HANDLING AND OTHER PRACTICES;



CLAIMS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS, WHICH OFTEN PRESENT COMPLEX COVERAGE AND DAMAGE VALUATION QUESTIONS;



CLAIMS UNDER DIRECTORS' & OFFICERS' INSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO: LOSSES FROM INVOLVEMENT IN FINANCIAL MARKET

ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MORTGAGE OR FINANCIAL PRODUCT ORIGINATION, DISTRIBUTION, STRUCTURING OR SERVICING AND FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES; FRAUD, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES;

POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES; AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ISSUES;



THE ASSERTION OF "PUBLIC NUISANCE" OR SIMILAR THEORIES OF LIABILITY, PURSUANT TO WHICH PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO RECOVER MONIES

SPENT TO ADMINISTER PUBLIC HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS; ABATE HAZARDS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND/OR RECOVER DAMAGES PURPORTEDLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A "PUBLIC NUISANCE";



MEDICAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT LINK HEALTH ISSUES TO PARTICULAR CAUSES, RESULTING IN LIABILITY CLAIMS;



CLAIMS RELATING TO UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES OF CURRENT OR NEW TECHNOLOGIES; AND



CLAIMS RELATING TO POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS.

IN

SOME INSTANCES, THESE EMERGING ISSUES MAY NOT BECOME APPARENT FOR SOME TIME AFTER WE HAVE ISSUED THE AFFECTED INSURANCE POLICIES. AS A RESULT, THE FULL EXTENT OF LIABILITY UNDER OUR

INSURANCE POLICIES MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THE POLICIES ARE ISSUED.

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL PASSAGE OF NEW LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO EXPAND THE RIGHT TO SUE, TO REMOVE LIMITATIONS ON RECOVERY, TO EXTEND THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OR OTHERWISE TO REPEAL

OR WEAKEN TORT REFORMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

THE

EFFECTS OF THESE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS

VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY.

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL REMAIN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE FOR THE

FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INSURERS, A NUMBER OF WHICH HAVE EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN RECENT PERIODS. COMPETITORS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES MAY OFFER PRODUCTS AT PRICES AND ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ECONOMIC STANDARDS IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE THEIR BUSINESS. THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CYCLICAL, WITH PERIODS CHARACTERIZED BY INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION AND LESS RESTRICTIVE UNDERWRITING STANDARDS FOLLOWED BY PERIODS OF HIGHER PREMIUM RATES AND MORE

SELECTIVE UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ALSO BE IMPACTED BY CURRENT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS AVAILABLE TO

US AS WELL AS TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, INCLUDING CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONOUTLOOK."

IN

RECENT YEARS, MANY INDEPENDENT PERSONAL INSURANCE AGENTS HAVE BEGUN TO UTILIZE PRICE COMPARISON RATING TECHNOLOGY, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS "COMPARATIVE RATERS," AS A

COST-EFFICIENT MEANS OF OBTAINING QUOTES FROM MULTIPLE COMPANIES. COMPARATIVE RATERS ALSO TEND TO PUT ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON PRICE OVER OTHER COMPETITIVE CRITERIA. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS

POTENTIAL FOR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED TO ACCESS COMPARATIVE RATES FOR SMALL COMMERCIAL BUSINESS. AGENTS AND BROKERS MAY ALSO CREATE ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS, SUCH

AS INSURANCE EXCHANGES, THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND PRICING.

OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO OUR.



ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS, TO OBTAIN NEW BUSINESS AND TO PROFITABLY PRICE OUR BUSINESS;



AGENT, BROKER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS;



SPEED OF CLAIMS PAYMENT;



PREMIUMS CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED (INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED

PROGRAMS);



ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER;



PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CORRESPONDING RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES;



REPUTATION, EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES;



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS;



LOCAL PRESENCE; AND



ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

WE

MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN CONTINUING TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON ANY OF THESE BASES IN THE FUTURE. IF COMPETITION LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING BUSINESS OR WRITE NEW BUSINESS AT

ADEQUATE RATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE "COMPETITION" SECTIONS OF THE DISCUSSION ON BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN "ITEM 1BUSINESS."

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT

ALL.

ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO US TO THE EXTENT OF THE CEDED REINSURANCE, WE REMAIN LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. AS A RESULT,

CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT ELIMINATE OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS.

IN

THE PAST, CERTAIN REINSURERS HAVE CEASED WRITING BUSINESS AND ENTERED INTO RUNOFF. SOME OF OUR REINSURANCE CLAIMS MAY BE DISPUTED BY THE REINSURERS AND WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE

PARTIAL OR NO PAYMENT. THIS IS A PARTICULAR RISK IN THE CASE OF CLAIMS THAT RELATE TO INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN

ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS

CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY. THE ABILITY OF REINSURERS TO TRANSFER THEIR RISKS TO

OTHER, LESS CREDITWORTHY REINSURERS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE TO US.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE CERTAIN AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS COMPRISE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

SETTLE CERTAIN

PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE WE DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT IS

INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AS WE RETAIN THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, WE WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS.

MANY

REINSURANCE COMPANIES AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE FINANCIAL MARKETS DISRUPTION AND THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. A NUMBER OF

THESE COMPANIES, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF THOSE WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, WERE DOWNGRADED BY VARIOUS RATING AGENCIES DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR TOP REINSURANCE GROUPS BY

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE AND THE TOP FIVE GROUPS BY AMOUNT OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS PROVIDED, SEE "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONSREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES."

THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRICE AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY. THE AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE CAPACITY CAN BE

IMPACTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONS IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET, SUCH AS THE OCCURRENCE OF SIGNIFICANT REINSURED EVENTS. THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE COULD AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL, AND/OR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY FAIL TO MAKE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, AND THUS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION TO EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES (DISCUSSED ABOVE), WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN SEVERAL OTHER AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK RELATING TO POLICYHOLDERS, INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND

BROKERS.

WE

ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN OUR SURETY INSURANCE OPERATIONS, WHERE WE GUARANTEE TO A THIRD PARTY THAT OUR CUSTOMER WILL SATISFY CERTAIN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (E.G., A

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT) OR CERTAIN FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. IF OUR CUSTOMER DEFAULTS, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES AND NOT BE REIMBURSED BY OUR CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, IT IS CUSTOMARY PRACTICE IN THE SURETY

BUSINESS FOR MULTIPLE INSURERS TO PARTICIPATE AS CO-SURETIES ON LARGE SURETY BONDS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE CO-SURETY OBLIGATIONS

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE

TYPICALLY JOINT AND SEVERAL, IN WHICH CASE WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR CO-SURETIES.

IN

ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO

PAY THE CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. WE ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT AND, AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK TO THE POLICYHOLDER.

MOREOVER, CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICIES (I.E., POLICIES IN WHICH PREMIUMS ARE ADJUSTED AFTER THE POLICY PERIOD BASED ON THE ACTUAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER DURING THE POLICY PERIOD). RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADJUSTED PREMIUM IS GREATER THAN THE ORIGINAL

PREMIUM.

OUR

EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK THAT WE HAVE TO OUR INSUREDS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. TO REDUCE SUCH CREDIT RISK, WE REQUIRE CERTAIN INSUREDS TO POST COLLATERAL FOR SOME OR ALL OF

THESE OBLIGATIONS, OFTEN IN THE FORM OF PLEDGED SECURITIES, SUCH AS MONEY MARKET FUNDS, OR LETTERS OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY BANKS. IN CASES WHERE WE RECEIVE PLEDGED SECURITIES AND THE INSUREDS ARE UNABLE

TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON THE SECURITIES PLEDGED AND/OR THE RISK THAT OUR ACCESS TO THAT COLLATERAL MAY BE STAYED DURING AN INSURED'S BANKRUPTCY. IN CASES WHERE

WE RECEIVE LETTERS OF CREDIT FROM BANKS AND THE INSUREDS ARE UNABLE TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE BANKS THAT ISSUED THE LETTERS OF CREDIT.

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHEN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE INSURANCE POLICIES FROM US THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE PREMIUMS RELATING TO THOSE POLICIES ARE OFTEN

PAID TO THE AGENTS AND BROKERS FOR PAYMENT TO US. IN MOST JURISDICTIONS, THE PREMIUMS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PAID TO US WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY US. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ASSUME A

DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS DUE FROM INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

TO

A LARGE DEGREE, THE CREDIT RISK WE FACE IS A FUNCTION OF THE ECONOMY; ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE A GREATER RISK IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE RISKS DISCUSSED ABOVE

THROUGH UNDERWRITING AND INVESTMENT GUIDELINES, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS, OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE, COLLATERAL OBTAINED MAY SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE LITTLE

OR NO VALUE. AS A RESULT, OUR EXPOSURE TO THE ABOVE CREDIT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED AND CHANGES IN REGULATION MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

WE ARE EXTENSIVELY

REGULATED AND

SUPERVISED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING LICENSING AND SUPERVISION BY GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AGENCIES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS.

THESE

REGULATORY SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS, AND NOT NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF INSURERS, THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INVESTORS. FOR

EXAMPLE, TO PROTECT POLICYHOLDERS WHOSE INSURANCE COMPANY BECOMES FINANCIALLY INSOLVENT, GUARANTY FUNDS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ALL FIFTY STATES TO PAY THE COVERED CLAIMS OF POLICYHOLDERS IN THE

EVENT OF AN INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURER, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE STATE LIMITS. THE FUNDING OF GUARANTY FUNDS IS PROVIDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST REMAINING INSURERS IN THE MARKETPLACE. AS A

RESULT, THE INSOLVENCY OF ONE OR MORE INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST US.

THESE

REGULATORY SYSTEMS ALSO ADDRESS AUTHORIZATION FOR LINES OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS, LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, UNDERWRITING

LIMITATIONS, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS, CHANGES IN CONTROL, PREMIUM RATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF AN INSURER'S BUSINESS.

IN

RECENT YEARS, THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, AND SOME STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR INCREASE STATE

AUTHORITY TO REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES. FURTHER, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY REEXAMINE

EXISTING LAWS

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND

REGULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN A TIME OF FINANCIAL

UNCERTAINTY OR A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR OTHERWISE, REGULATORS MAY CHOOSE TO ADOPT MORE RESTRICTIVE INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, INSURANCE REGULATORS MAY CHOOSE TO RESTRICT THE

ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES OR REJECT RATE INCREASES DUE TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS MAY ALSO INCREASE THE STATUTORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.

ALTHOUGH

THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT HISTORICALLY REGULATED THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS FROM TIME TO TIME, INCLUDING AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2008 AND

2009, TO IMPOSE FEDERAL REGULATION ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. ON JULY 21, 2010, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE

DODD-FRANK ACT). AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DODD-FRANK ACT ESTABLISHES A FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE WITHIN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. THE FEDERAL INSURANCE OFFICE

INITIALLY HAS LIMITED REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND IS EMPOWERED TO GATHER DATA AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND INSURERS, INCLUDING CONDUCTING A STUDY FOR SUBMISSION TO THE U.S.

CONGRESS ON HOW TO MODERNIZE AND IMPROVE INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE U.S. FURTHER, THE

DODD-FRANK ACT GIVES THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, INCLUDING INSURANCE COMPANIES, IF THEY ARE DESIGNATED BY A

TWO-THIRDS VOTE OF A FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE COUNCIL) AS "SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT." WHILE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE ARE "SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT," AS DEFINED IN THE

DODD-FRANK ACT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COUNCIL MAY CONCLUDE THAT WE ARE. IF WE WERE DESIGNATED AS "SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT," THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY COULD INCLUDE THE

ABILITY TO IMPOSE HEIGHTENED FINANCIAL REGULATION AND COULD IMPACT REQUIREMENTS REGARDING OUR CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE AS WELL AS OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT CONDUCT. AS A RESULT OF THE

FOREGOING, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, OR OTHER ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REGULATION THAT IS ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE, COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON US, INCLUDING IMPACTING THE WAYS IN WHICH WE

CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, INCREASING COMPLIANCE COSTS AND DUPLICATING STATE REGULATION, AND COULD RESULT IN A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE, PARTICULARLY RELATIVE TO SMALLER INSURERS WHO MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO

THE SAME LEVEL OF REGULATION.

EVEN

IF WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SECTOR REGULATORY REFORM, INCLUDING THE DODD-FRANK ACT, COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON US. FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATORY REFORM COULD HAVE AN UNEXPECTED IMPACT ON OUR RIGHTS AS A CREDITOR OR ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN PARTICULAR, THE DODD-FRANK ACT

AUTHORIZES ASSESSMENTS TO PAY FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BECOME INSOLVENT. WE (AS A FINANCIAL COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN ASSETS)

COULD BE ASSESSED, AND, ALTHOUGH ANY SUCH ASSESSMENT IS REQUIRED TO BE RISK WEIGHTED (I.E., RISKIER FIRMS PAY MORE), SUCH COSTS COULD BE MATERIAL TO US AND ARE CURRENTLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO

ESTIMATE.

OTHER

POTENTIAL CHANGES IN U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL REPEAL OF THE MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT AND POTENTIAL CHANGES IN

FEDERAL TAXATION, COULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING US. IN ADDITION, STATE TAX LAWS THAT SPECIFICALLY IMPACT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES OR OTHER TAXES,

MAY BE ENACTED OR CHANGED BY STATES TO RAISE REVENUES.

AS

A U.S.-BASED SEC REPORTING COMPANY, WE ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP), AS

PROMULGATED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB). THE SEC IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING WHETHER TO REQUIRE THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS), AS PROMULGATED BY THE

INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (IASB), FOR COMPANIES SUCH AS US. THE FASB AND THE IASB HAVE ALSO EMBARKED ON A LONG-TERM PROJECT TO CONVERGE GAAP AND IFRS. ADDITIONALLY, THE IASB

AND THE FASB ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A GLOBAL INSURANCE STANDARD THAT MAY INVOLVE METHODOLOGIES FOR VALUING INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE

METHODOLOGIES REQUIRED BY CURRENT GAAP. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER WE WILL CHOOSE TO, OR BE REQUIRED TO,

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADOPT

IFRS OR HOW THE ADOPTION OF IFRS (OR THE CONVERGENCE OF GAAP AND IFRS, INCLUDING THE PROJECT FOR VALUING INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES) MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT SPECIFICALLY APPLY TO INSURANCE COMPANY OPERATIONS, MAY IMPACT THE CONTENT AND PRESENTATION OF OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND COULD HAVE

ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING LOWER REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND INCREASED VOLATILITY AND DECREASED COMPARABILITY OF OUR REPORTED

RESULTS WITH OTHER INSURERS.

THE

EUROPEAN UNION'S EXECUTIVE BODY, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, IS IMPLEMENTING NEW CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND RISK MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS CALLED SOLVENCY II THAT WOULD APPLY TO OUR BUSINESSES

ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION BEGINNING AS SOON AS THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. UNDER SOLVENCY II, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE U.S. PARENT OF A EUROPEAN UNION SUBSIDIARY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SOLVENCY II

REQUIREMENTS IF THE REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT THE SUBSIDIARY'S CAPITAL POSITION IS DEPENDENT ON THE PARENT COMPANY AND THE U.S. COMPANY IS NOT ALREADY SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS DEEMED "EQUIVALENT" TO

SOLVENCY II. IN ADDITION, REGULATORS IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE OPERATIONS ARE WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS (AND IN THE U.S., WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS) TO CONSIDER CHANGES TO INSURANCE COMPANY SUPERVISION, INCLUDING SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS AND GROUP SUPERVISION. WHILE IT IS NOT YET KNOWN HOW THESE ACTIONS WILL IMPACT US, SUCH

REGULATION COULD RESULT IN A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, INCREASED COSTS OF COMPLIANCE, INCREASED DISCLOSURE AND LESS FLEXIBILITY IN OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT.

U.S.

OR NON-U.S. INSURANCE LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR

HIGHER COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND THUS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

A DOWNGRADE IN OUR CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INCREASE

OUR

BORROWING COSTS.

CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO AN INSURER'S COMPETITIVE POSITION. RATING AGENCIES REVIEW INSURERS' RATINGS

PERIODICALLY, AND CHANGE THEIR RATINGS CRITERIA PERIODICALLY, AND THEREFORE OUR CURRENT RATINGS MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR RATINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT

OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE REDUCED, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE MANY CUSTOMERS MAY REQUIRE THAT WE MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATINGS TO ENTER INTO OR RENEW BUSINESS WITH

US. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND WE MAY INCUR HIGHER BORROWING COSTS. IF SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RESULTING FROM ONE OR

MORE MAJOR CATASTROPHES, OR SIGNIFICANT RESERVE ADDITIONS OR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT LOSSES WERE TO CAUSE OUR CAPITAL POSITION TO DETERIORATE SIGNIFICANTLY, OR IF ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES

SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE (WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO AT A REASONABLE COST OR AT ALL) IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR

LIMIT THE EXTENT OF A DOWNGRADE. A CONTINUED TREND OF MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHES OR A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN MAY LEAD RATING AGENCIES TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR RATINGS, SEE, "ITEM 1BUSINESSRATINGS."

THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS, PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER

DIVIDENDS

OR MAKE

FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES.

OUR HOLDING COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON

OUTSTANDING DEBT, TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLAN, TO PAY OTHER CORPORATE EXPENSES AND TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THEIR STATUTORY SURPLUS, EARNINGS AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY SOME STATES AS AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. IN A TIME OF PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR OTHERWISE, REGULATORS MAY CHOOSE TO

FURTHER RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IS ALSO RESTRICTED

BY REGULATIONS THAT SET STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED. THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR

DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS, TO PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES.

DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS

PRIMARILY

THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN THROUGH LESS THAN A DOZEN SUCH INTERMEDIARIES. LOSS OF ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDED

THROUGH SUCH AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE MAY ALSO SEEK TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INCLUDING OUR

CURRENT EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PLATFORM IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, AGENTS AND BROKERS MAY CREATE ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR

COMMERCIAL BUSINESS, SUCH AS INSURANCE EXCHANGES, THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND PRICING. OUR OR THEIR EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COULD ADVERSELY

IMPACT OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS WHO CURRENTLY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, RESULTING IN A LOWER VOLUME OF BUSINESS GENERATED FROM THESE SOURCES.

WE

RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKETING AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY INCREASINGLY RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS AND TOLL-FREE NUMBERS FOR

DISTRIBUTION. IN SOME INSTANCES, OUR AGENTS AND BROKERS ARE REQUIRED TO ACCESS SEPARATE BUSINESS PLATFORMS TO EXECUTE THE SALE OF OUR PERSONAL INSURANCE OR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. SHOULD

INTERNET DISRUPTIONS OCCUR, OR FRUSTRATION WITH OUR BUSINESS PLATFORMS OR DISTRIBUTION INITIATIVES DEVELOP AMONG OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE RESULTING LOSS OF BUSINESS COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN TARGETED MARKETS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AND MAY CREATE ENHANCED RISKS.

A NUMBER OF OUR

RECENT AND

PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES INVOLVE DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPANDING EXISTING PRODUCTS IN TARGETED MARKETS. THIS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING EFFORTS, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO PROTECT OR GROW MARKET

SHARE.



WE MAY DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT INSURE RISKS WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY INSURED OR CONTAIN NEW COVERAGE OR COVERAGE TERMS.



WE MAY REFINE OUR UNDERWRITING PROCESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY

INCREASED THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS THAT FLOWS THROUGH OUR AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING SYSTEMS.



WE MAY SEEK TO EXPAND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, SUCH AS OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

PLATFORM IN PERSONAL INSURANCE.



WE MAY FOCUS ON GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE HAVE HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE OR NO MARKET

SHARE.

WE

MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPANDING IN TARGETED MARKETS AND, EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL, THESE EFFORTS MAY CREATE ENHANCED RISKS. AMONG OTHER

RISKS.



DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR IN NEW MARKETS MAY NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS.



TO THE EXTENT WE ARE ABLE TO MARKET NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN NEW MARKETS, OUR RISK EXPOSURES MAY CHANGE, AND THE DATA AND

MODELS WE USE TO MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES MAY NOT BE AS

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SOPHISTICATED

AS THOSE WE USE IN EXISTING MARKETS OR WITH EXISTING PRODUCTS. THIS, IN TURN, COULD LEAD TO LOSSES IN EXCESS OF OUR EXPECTATIONS.



MODELS UNDERLYING AUTOMATED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DECISIONS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.



EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE OR INCREASE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CONFLICT, SUCH AS

DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER "DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US."



IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS TO A NEW PRODUCT, SOME POLICYHOLDERS' PRICING MAY INCREASE,

WHILE THE PRICING FOR OTHER POLICYHOLDERS MAY DECREASE, THE NET IMPACT OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT RETENTION AND MARGINS.



TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, WE MAY NEED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES, WHICH MAY ALSO

NEGATIVELY IMPACT RESULTS IN THE NEAR TERM.

IF

OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR EXPAND IN TARGETED MARKETS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE.

FEDERAL TAX

LEGISLATION COULD

BE ENACTED TO REDUCE THE EXISTING STATUTORY U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35%, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDINGLY, REDUCE OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS

VOLATILE AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN UNREALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE EFFECT OF A REDUCTION IN A TAX RATE ON NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED, IN FULL, AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN ENACTED AND, THEREFORE, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRICING AND CAPITAL MODELS ARE INACCURATE.

THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY BUSINESS

SUBSTANTIALLY

DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS WE USE IN PRICING OUR POLICIES. WE UTILIZE MODELS TO HELP US PRICE BUSINESS IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED

TO BE CONSISTENT, OVER TIME, WITH ACTUAL RESULTS AND RETURN OBJECTIVES. WE ALSO USE VARIOUS METHODS, INCLUDING PREDICTIVE MODELING, FORECASTING AND SOPHISTICATED SIMULATION MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO

ANALYZE LOSS TRENDS AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE ALSO USE THESE ANALYSES AND METHODS IN MAKING UNDERWRITING, PRICING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS AS PART OF MANAGING OUR

EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES AND OTHER EXTREME ADVERSE EVENTS. THESE MODELS INCORPORATE NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND FORECASTS ABOUT THE FUTURE LEVEL AND VARIABILITY OF: INTEREST RATES, INFLATION, CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF LOSSES, AMONG OTHERS, THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO MAKE AND MAY BE MATERIALLY WRONG. FUTURE EXPERIENCE MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM PAST AND CURRENT EXPERIENCE

INCORPORATED IN A MODEL'S FORECASTS OR SIMULATIONS. THIS INCLUDES THE LIKELIHOOD OF EVENTS OCCURRING OR CONTINUING OR THE CORRELATION AMONG EVENTS. IF WE FAIL TO APPROPRIATELY PRICE THE RISKS WE

INSURE, OR FAIL TO CHANGE OUR PRICING MODEL TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT OUR CURRENT EXPERIENCE, OR IF OUR CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS MORE FREQUENT OR SEVERE THAN OUR UNDERLYING RISK ASSUMPTIONS, OUR PROFIT

MARGINS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE FREQUENCY AND/OR SEVERITY OF EXTREME ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRING, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE

RISKS WE ARE EXPOSED TO, WE MAY OVERPRICE OUR PRODUCTS, AND NEW BUSINESS GROWTH AND RETENTION OF OUR EXISTING BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FURTHER, AS WE EXPAND INTO DIFFERENT MARKETS AND

GEOGRAPHIES, WE WILL WRITE MORE POLICIES IN MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS WHERE WE HAVE LESS DATA SPECIFIC TO THESE NEW MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES, AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ERROR

IN OUR MODELS AND STRATEGY.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES PRIMARILY

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. IN ADDITION, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO COMMENCE A JOINT VENTURE IN BRAZIL AND MAY

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALSO

EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING OTHER EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS INDIA AND CHINA.

WHILE

OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES CURRENTLY CONSTITUTES A RELATIVELY SMALL PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, IN CONDUCTING SUCH BUSINESS WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

RISKS, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS PRICE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE LIMITS, OWNERSHIP LIMITS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE OR

ANTI-COMPETITIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION. OUR INVESTMENTS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY ALSO SUBJECT US TO CURRENCY RISK, AND, IN SOME MARKETS, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE THAT RISK. IN ADDITION, IN SOME MARKETS, WE MAY INVEST AS PART OF A JOINT

VENTURE WITH A LOCAL COUNTERPARTY. BECAUSE OUR GOVERNANCE RIGHTS MAY BE LIMITED, WE MAY NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE ABILITY OF THE JOINT VENTURE TO MAKE CERTAIN DECISIONS AND/OR MITIGATE RISKS IT FACES,

AND SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS WITH A JOINT VENTURE COUNTERPARTY MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT. INVESTMENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ALSO SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND SIMILAR LAWS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT PROHIBIT THE MAKING OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN OFFICIALS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POLICIES AND CONTROLS

IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, IF THOSE CONTROLS ARE INEFFECTIVE AND AN EMPLOYEE OR INTERMEDIARY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD SUFFER

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND OUR BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SOME COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY EMERGING ECONOMIES, HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LACK CLARITY AND, EVEN

WITH LOCAL EXPERTISE AND EFFECTIVE CONTROLS, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF, AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER, THE LOCAL LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING

BRAZIL, PARTIES TO A JOINT VENTURE MAY, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, HAVE LIABILITY FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS OF THE VENTURE AND THAT LIABILITY MAY EXTEND BEYOND THE CAPITAL INVESTED. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH

LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITY AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESS IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY.

OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY.

WE DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS FOR CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND PROCESSING CLAIMS, AND THUS OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON

MAINTAINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ENHANCE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN A COST AND

RESOURCE EFFICIENT MANNER. SOME SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR EXPENSE RATIOS AS WE INVEST IN THE PROJECTS AND MAY COST MORE THAN WE EXPECT

TO COMPLETE. IN ADDITION, SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY NOT DELIVER THE BENEFITS WE EXPECT ONCE THEY ARE COMPLETE, OR MAY BE REPLACED OR BECOME OBSOLETE MORE QUICKLY THAN EXPECTED, WHICH COULD

RESULT IN ACCELERATED RECOGNITION OF EXPENSES. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGE AND UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, OR IF THE COSTS OF DOING SO ARE HIGHER THAN WE EXPECT, OUR ABILITY

TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE SERVICES TO NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA SECURITY AND/OR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

WHILE TECHNOLOGY CAN STREAMLINE MANY BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE COST OF OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISKS.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR EMPLOYEES' ABILITY TO PERFORM, IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. A SHUT-DOWN OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS,

ONE OR MORE OF OUR FACILITIES; A POWER OUTAGE; OR A FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SUCH

FUNCTIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS. IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER SUCH AS A NATURAL CATASTROPHE, TERRORIST ATTACK OR INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT, OR DUE TO A COMPUTER VIRUS, OUR SYSTEMS COULD BE INACCESSIBLE FOR AN

EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS INTERFACE WITH AND DEPEND ON THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE SERVICE DENIALS OR

FAILURES OF CONTROLS IF DEMAND FOR

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

SERVICE EXCEEDS CAPACITY OR A THIRD-PARTY SYSTEM FAILS OR EXPERIENCES AN INTERRUPTION. IF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS SUCH A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, SYSTEM FAILURE OR

SERVICE DENIAL, THIS COULD RESULT IN A DETERIORATION OF OUR ABILITY TO WRITE AND PROCESS NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS, PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE, PAY CLAIMS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR PERFORM OTHER NECESSARY

BUSINESS FUNCTIONS.

OUR

OPERATIONS RELY ON THE SECURE PROCESSING, STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. COMPUTER VIRUSES, HACKERS, EMPLOYEE

MISCONDUCT AND OTHER EXTERNAL HAZARDS COULD EXPOSE OUR DATA SYSTEMS TO SECURITY BREACHES. IN ADDITION, WE ROUTINELY TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE PERSONAL, CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BY EMAIL AND

OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP SECURE TRANSMISSION CAPABILITIES WITH THIRD-PARTY VENDORS AND OTHERS WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PUT IN PLACE SECURE CAPABILITIES

WITH ALL OF SUCH VENDORS AND THIRD PARTIES AND, IN ADDITION, THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION.

THESE

INCREASED RISKS, AND EXPANDING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING DATA SECURITY, COULD EXPOSE US TO DATA LOSS, MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN

COMPLIANCE COSTS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE

OUTSOURCE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES AND MAY DO SO INCREASINGLY IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MONITOR OUR

OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS, THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS DO NOT PERFORM AS ANTICIPATED OR WE EXPERIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH A TRANSITION, WE MAY NOT REALIZE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS OR COST

EFFICIENCIES AND MAY EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, INCREASED COSTS AND A LOSS OF BUSINESS. OUR OUTSOURCING OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES MAY EXPOSE US TO

ENHANCED RISK RELATED TO DATA SECURITY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES

MIGHT BE IMPACTED BY CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, UNANTICIPATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR POLICIES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR

BUSINESS MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY RESULT IN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

FROM TIME

TO TIME WE MAY

INVESTIGATE AND PURSUE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES IF WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES AND THAT THE POTENTIAL REWARDS OF AN ACQUISITION EXCEED

THE RISKS. THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING AN ACQUIRED COMPANY OR BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, HOWEVER, AND MAY CREATE UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENDITURES. FOR EXAMPLE, ACQUISITIONS

MAY PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISKS, INCLUDING.



THE POTENTIAL DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESS;



THE INEFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS HANDLING AND ACTUARIAL PRACTICES;



THE UNCERTAINTY OF AN ACQUIREE'S RESERVE ESTIMATES;



THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO ACQUISITION INTEGRATION CHALLENGES;



THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES;



THE CULTURAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING EMPLOYEES; AND



THE IMPACT OF AN ACQUISITION ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR CREDIT RATINGS.

THE

ACQUIRED BUSINESS MAY NOT PERFORM AS PROJECTED, AND ANY COST SAVINGS AND OTHER SYNERGIES ANTICIPATED FROM THE ACQUISITION MAY NOT MATERIALIZE. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY

BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE FUTURE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED, AND THE INEFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF OUR BUSINESSES AND PROCESSES MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR DELAYS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE.

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR CONTROLS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS ARE NOT

EFFECTIVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE ON A DAILY BASIS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING, CLAIM PROCESSING AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX. THESE ACTIVITIES OFTEN ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNAL GUIDELINES AND POLICIES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. IF OUR CONTROLS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, IT COULD LEAD TO FINANCIAL LOSS, UNANTICIPATED RISK

EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK) OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM

WITHIN THE

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND FROM BUSINESSES OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, ESPECIALLY IN KEY POSITIONS. OUR PERFORMANCE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TALENTS, EFFORTS AND

PROPER CONDUCT OF HIGHLY-SKILLED INDIVIDUALS; THEREFORE, OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR BUSINESSES AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW

EMPLOYEES AND TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EMPLOYEES, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND REPUTATION COULD BE

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

LOSS OF OR SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN THE PRICING AND UNDERWRITING OF PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE

PROFITABILITY.

IN PERSONAL INSURANCE, WE USE CREDIT SCORING AS A FACTOR IN PRICING DECISIONS WHERE ALLOWED BY STATE LAW. SOME CONSUMER GROUPS AND REGULATORS HAVE

QUESTIONED WHETHER THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH LOW INCOMES, MINORITY GROUPS AND THE ELDERLY AND ARE CALLING FOR THE PROHIBITION OR RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF

CREDIT SCORING IN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING. LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING, IF ENACTED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF STATES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE

PROFITABILITY.

OVERVIEW

DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE OF $6.62 IN 2010 INCREASED BY 5% OVER DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE OF $6.33 IN 2009, DESPITE A DECREASE IN

REPORTED NET INCOME, DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES OVER THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS. NET INCOME OF $3.22 BILLION IN 2010 WAS $406 MILLION LOWER THAN IN 2009,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES, A MODEST DECLINE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND REDUCED UNDERWRITING MARGINS RELATED TO PRICING AND LOSS COST

TRENDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS. THE COST OF CATASTROPHES IN 2010 AND 2009 TOTALED $1.11 BILLION AND $457 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 AND 2009 TOTALED $1.25 BILLION AND $1.33 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, NET INCOME IN 2009 REFLECTED A REDUCTION

INCOME OF $2.92 BILLION. THE HIGHER RATE OF GROWTH IN PER SHARE INCOME COMPARED WITH GROWTH IN INCOME REFLECTED THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES OVER THE PREVIOUS

TWELVE MONTHS. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME IN 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE REFLECTED NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (VERSUS NET

REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES IN 2008), LOWER NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES AND FEWER LARGE PROPERTY LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN UNDERWRITING MARGINS RELATED TO PRICING

AND LOSS COST TRENDS, A DECLINE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND LOWER FEE INCOME. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2009 TOTALED $457 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.41 BILLION IN

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS TOTALED $3.81 BILLION, 2% LOWER THAN THE TOTAL OF $3.88 BILLION IN 2008. CHANGES IN THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS IN BOTH 2010

AND 2009 WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES IN EARNED PREMIUMS IN EACH YEAR AS COMPARED TO THE PRECEDING YEAR.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

IN 2010, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TOTALED $3.41 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $40 MILLION, OR 1%, OVER THE 2009

TOTAL OF $3.37 BILLION. THE 2009 TOTAL INCLUDED A REDUCTION OF $87 MILLION IN THE ESTIMATE OF PROPERTY WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO HURRICANE IKE DUE TO A DECLINE IN ESTIMATED

INSURANCE INDUSTRY LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE IKE. EXCLUDING THAT ADJUSTMENT IN 2009, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2010 WERE $47 MILLION, OR 1%, LOWER THAN IN 2009. THE DECLINE WAS

CONCENTRATED IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, AND WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSES IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY'S DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE AND IN THE

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT DUE TO EMPLOYEE- AND TECHNOLOGY-RELATED COSTS TO ENHANCE OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT FUTURE BUSINESS GROWTH.

GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TOTALED $3.37 BILLION IN 2009, A DECREASE OF $152 MILLION, OR 4%, FROM THE COMPARABLE 2008 TOTAL OF $3.52 BILLION. THE DECREASE

ASSESSMENTS IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY RECORDED AN $87 MILLION REDUCTION IN THESE ESTIMATED ASSESSMENTS IN 2009 DUE TO A DECLINE IN

ESTIMATED INSURANCE INDUSTRY LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE IKE. ADJUSTING FOR THE IMPACT OF WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS IN BOTH 2009 AND 2008, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2009 INCREASED 2% OVER

2008. THE INCREASE REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE

SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON EXPENSES IN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT.

HURRICANE-RELATED

PROPERTY WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS ARE LEVIED ON INSURERS PERIODICALLY BY STATE-CREATED INSURANCE AND WINDSTORM INSURANCE ENTITIES SUCH AS CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE

CORPORATION IN FLORIDA, LOUISIANA CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION AND THE TEXAS WINDSTORM INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. THESE ASSESSMENTS ARE LEVIED ON THE INSURERS WRITING BUSINESS IN THOSE STATES

TO FUND THE OPERATING DEFICITS OF SUCH ENTITIES DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT STORM ACTIVITY. HURRICANE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF "GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES" AS THE

AMOUNTS PAID TO SUCH ENTITIES ARE NOT INSURED LOSSES OF THE COMPANY.

INTEREST EXPENSE

INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008 TOTALED $388 MILLION, $382 MILLION AND $370 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE

INCREASES IN 2010 AND 2009 OVER THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER AVERAGE LEVELS OF DEBT OUTSTANDING.

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 25%, 23% AND 21% IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2009 BENEFITED

FROM THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS. EXCLUDING THAT BENEFIT IN 2009, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES IN 2010 AND 2009 WERE VIRTUALLY LEVEL. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE RATE IN 2009

COMPARED TO 2008 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE CHANGE IN INCOME BEFORE TAXES BETWEEN YEARS AND THE PROPORTION OF TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENT INCOME IN EACH YEAR.

GAAP COMBINED RATIOS

THE CONSOLIDATED GAAP COMBINED RATIO OF 93.2% IN 2010 WAS 4.0 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE CONSOLIDATED GAAP COMBINED RATIO OF 89.2% IN 2009.

THE

CONSOLIDATED LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 61.0% IN 2010 WAS 3.7 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 57.3% IN 2009. CATASTROPHE LOSSES

ACCOUNTED FOR 5.2 POINTS AND 2.1 POINTS OF THE 2010 AND 2009 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2010 AND 2009 CONSOLIDATED LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS INCLUDED 5.8

POINT AND 6.2 POINT BENEFITS FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, RESPECTIVELY. THE CONSOLIDATED LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS EXCLUDING CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 WAS 0.2 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2009 RATIO ON THE SAME BASIS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF REDUCED UNDERWRITING MARGINS RELATED TO PRICING AND LOSS COST TRENDS IN THE

BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, LARGELY OFFSET BY EARNED RATE INCREASES MODESTLY OUTPACING LOSS COST TRENDS IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT.

THE

CONSOLIDATED UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 32.2% IN 2010 WAS 0.3 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2009 CONSOLIDATED UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 31.9%. THE 2009 RATIO REFLECTED A 0.4 POINT

BENEFIT RESULTING FROM THE REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATE OF PROPERTY WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO HURRICANE IKE. EXCLUDING THAT FACTOR IN 2009, THE CONSOLIDATED UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IN 2010 WAS

0.1 POINTS LOWER THAN IN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER EXPENSES IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSES IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY'S

DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE AND IN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT DUE TO EMPLOYEE- AND TECHNOLOGY-RELATED COSTS TO ENHANCE OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT FUTURE

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME OF $2.30 BILLION IN 2010 WAS $289 MILLION, OR 11%, LOWER THAN 2009 OPERATING INCOME OF

$2.59 BILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES, THE MODEST DECLINE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, REDUCED UNDERWRITING MARGINS RELATED TO

PRICING AND LOSS COST TRENDS AND A HIGHER NUMBER OF LARGE LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND A DECLINE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, OPERATING

INCOME IN 2009 INCLUDED BENEFITS OF $42 MILLION FROM THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS AND A $38 MILLION REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATE OF PROPERTY WINDPOOL

ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO HURRICANE IKE. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2010 TOTALED $437 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $176 MILLION IN 2009. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED

$901 MILLION IN 2010, COMPARED WITH $1.03 BILLION IN 2009.

IN

2009, OPERATING INCOME OF $2.59 BILLION WAS $252 MILLION, OR 11%, HIGHER THAN 2008 OPERATING INCOME OF $2.34 BILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE

IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED UNDERWRITING MARGINS AND FEE INCOME. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2009 AND 2008 TOTALED $176 MILLION AND $706 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE 2008 TOTAL WAS PRINCIPALLY COMPRISED OF $642 MILLION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES AND $62 MILLION OF PROPERTY WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $1.03 BILLION AND $1.12 BILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING INCOME IN 2009 ALSO INCLUDED THE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

REFER TO THE "NET INVESTMENT INCOME" SECTION OF "CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" HEREIN FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGES IN THE

COMPANY'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2010 AND 2009 AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

FEE INCOME

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FEE INCOME DUE TO ITS SERVICE BUSINESSES, WHICH INCLUDE CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES

TO LARGE COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE TO SELF-INSURE A PORTION OF THEIR INSURANCE RISKS, AS WELL AS CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS. THE

$21 MILLION AND $84 MILLION DECLINES, RESPECTIVELY, IN FEE INCOME IN 2010 AND 2009 COMPARED WITH THE PRECEDING YEAR PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOWER NEW BUSINESS VOLUME DUE TO LOWER LEVELS OF

ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND LOWER SERVICED PREMIUM AND CLAIM VOLUME DUE TO THE DE-POPULATION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS. THE DECLINES IN BOTH YEARS ALSO REFLECTED THE IMPACT

OF BOTH LOWER CLAIM VOLUME AND LOWER LOSS COSTS (AS FEES ARE BASED EITHER ON THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS SERVICED OR AS A PERCENTAGE OF LOSSES) DRIVEN BY WORKERS' COMPENSATION REFORMS, AS WELL AS OVERALL

LOWER CLAIM FREQUENCY AND INCREASED COMPETITION.

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2010 TOTALED $6.50 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $467 MILLION, OR 8%, OVER 2009,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES, THE MODEST DECLINE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, A HIGHER NUMBER OF LARGE LOSSES AND THE IMPACT OF LOSS COST

TRENDS. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2010 AND 2009 TOTALED $437 MILLION AND $176 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2010 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM SEVERAL SEVERE WIND AND HAIL STORMS AS

WELL AS SEVERE WINTER STORMS. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 AND 2009 TOTALED $901 MILLION AND $1.03 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROPERTY, GENERAL LIABILITY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION PRODUCT LINES FOR MULTIPLE ACCIDENT YEARS, AS WELL AS IN ASSUMED

REINSURANCE, WHICH IS IN RUNOFF. THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE IMPROVEMENT PRIMARILY OCCURRED IN THE 2008 AND 2009 ACCIDENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN INDUSTRY-FOCUSED

UNDERWRITING AND TARGET RISK UNDERWRITING. THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE IMPROVEMENT WAS CONCENTRATED IN EXCESS COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2006 AND PRIOR AND REFLECTED WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES

ARE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION PRODUCT LINE WAS CONCENTRATED IN ACCIDENT YEARS 2007 AND PRIOR AND RESULTED

FROM BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT. THE IMPROVEMENT IN ASSUMED REINSURANCE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM FAVORABLE RESOLUTIONS OF CLAIMS AND DISPUTES FROM ACCIDENT YEARS 2002 AND PRIOR. IN ADDITION,

BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT IN RECENT YEARS RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE RE-ESTIMATION OF RESERVES FOR UNALLOCATED LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2010.

THE NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THESE PRODUCT LINES IN 2010 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $140 MILLION AND $35 MILLION INCREASES TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES,

RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL IN THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS HEREIN.

CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2009 TOTALED $6.04 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $571 MILLION, OR 9%, COMPARED WITH 2008. THE DECREASE IN 2009 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF LOSS COST TRENDS AND THE MODEST DECLINE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. CATASTROPHE LOSSES INCLUDED IN

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2009 TOTALED $176 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $642 MILLION IN 2008. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2009 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM SEVERAL WIND AND HAIL STORMS, AS

WELL AS FLOODING. IN 2008, HURRICANES IKE, GUSTAV AND DOLLY, AND OTHER WIND, RAIN AND HAIL STORMS IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES. NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2009 AND 2008 TOTALED $1.03 BILLION AND $1.12 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2009 TOTAL WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT

PRIMARILY

CONCENTRATED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY PRODUCT LINES FOR RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS, REFLECTING GREATER REDUCTIONS IN

FREQUENCY THAN THE COMPANY EXPECTED BASED UPON LONG-TERM FREQUENCY TRENDS THAT HAVE BEEN DECLINING. THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PRODUCT LINES EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN

ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL,

UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN

EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES TO BE MORE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, CLAIM HANDLING INITIATIVES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN AUTO SAFETY

TECHNOLOGY. THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE IMPROVEMENT PRIMARILY OCCURRED IN THE 2007 AND 2008 ACCIDENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR CERTAIN LARGE NATIONAL

PROPERTY AND INLAND MARINE EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE'S 2005 ACCIDENT YEAR EXPERIENCE IMPROVED DUE TO THE LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO, AND ONGOING CLAIM

SETTLEMENTS FOR, HURRICANE KATRINA. THE NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THESE PRODUCT LINES IN 2009 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $185 MILLION AND $70 MILLION INCREASES TO

ASBESTOS RESERVES AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, RESPECTIVELY (DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS HEREIN).

NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT IN 2008 WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PRODUCT LINES,

AN INCREASE IN ANTICIPATED CEDED REINSURANCE RECOVERIES FOR OLDER ACCIDENT YEARS IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE AND BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINES. THE NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL LINES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED

LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE IMPROVEMENT OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN THE 2007 ACCIDENT

YEAR AS A RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR CERTAIN LARGE NATIONAL PROPERTY, NATIONAL PROGRAMS, AND OCEAN MARINE CLAIM EXPOSURES AND LOWER THAN EXPECTED WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES DURING

THE LAST HALF OF 2007, AS WELL AS FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN CERTAIN LARGE INLAND MARINE CLAIM EXPOSURES AND IN CEDED REINSURANCE RECOVERIES FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY LARGE CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND PROPERTY PRODUCT LINES' 2005 ACCIDENT YEAR RESULTS EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENT DUE TO THE LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO, AND ONGOING CLAIM SETTLEMENTS FOR, HURRICANE

KATRINA. THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE IMPROVEMENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND

CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE FOREGOING PRODUCT LINES IN 2008 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE

WORKERS' COMPENSATION PRODUCT LINE, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED MEDICAL COSTS RELATED TO 2004 AND PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS, AND BY $70 MILLION AND $85 MILLION INCREASES TO

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, RESPECTIVELY (DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS HEREIN).

THE

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS TOTALED $1.75 BILLION IN 2010, $26 MILLION LOWER THAN THE COMPARABLE TOTAL OF $1.78 BILLION IN 2009. IN 2009, THE

REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF ESTIMATES OF WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO HURRICANE IKE IN EACH YEAR. DURING 2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED $62 MILLION OF HURRICANE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS IN GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SUBSEQUENTLY, DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $38 MILLION REDUCTION IN THESE ASSESSMENTS DUE TO A DECLINE IN ESTIMATED INSURANCE INDUSTRY LOSSES

RELATED TO HURRICANE IKE.

GAAP COMBINED RATIO

THE GAAP COMBINED RATIO OF 91.3% IN 2010 WAS 5.2 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE GAAP COMBINED RATIO OF 86.1% IN 2009.

IN

2010, THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 59.1% WAS 5.2 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2009 RATIO OF 53.9%. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2010 AND 2009 ACCOUNTED FOR 4.1 POINTS AND 1.6

POINTS OF THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO, RESPECTIVELY. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT PROVIDED 8.4 POINT AND 9.3 POINT BENEFITS TO THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO

IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2010 EXCLUDING CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS 1.8 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2009 RATIO ON THE SAME

BASIS, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF REDUCED UNDERWRITING MARGINS RELATED TO PRICING AND LOSS COST TRENDS AND A HIGHER NUMBER OF LARGE LOSSES.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 32.2% IN 2010 WAS LEVEL WITH THE 2009 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO. THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IN 2009 INCLUDED A 0.3 POINT BENEFIT FROM THE REDUCTION

IN THE ESTIMATE OF WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ADJUSTING FOR THAT FACTOR IN 2009, THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO FOR 2010 WAS 0.3 POINTS LOWER THAN THE 2009 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO. THE

IMPROVEMENT IN THE 2010 ADJUSTED EXPENSE RATIO REFLECTED THE DECLINE IN EXPENSES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

THE

GAAP COMBINED RATIO OF 86.1% IN 2009 WAS 4.1 POINTS LOWER THAN THE GAAP COMBINED RATIO OF 90.2% IN 2008.

IN

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2009 ADJUSTED FOR THE COST OF CATASTROPHES AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS 0.4 POINTS

LOWER THAN THE 2008 RATIO ON THE SAME BASIS, DUE TO LOWER NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES AND FEWER LARGE PROPERTY LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED UNDERWRITING MARGINS RELATED

TO PRICING AND LOSS COST TRENDS.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 32.2% IN 2009 WAS 0.3 POINTS LOWER THAN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 32.5% IN 2008. THE 2009 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO INCLUDED A 0.3 POINT

BENEFIT FROM THE REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATE OF WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHEREAS THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IN 2008 INCLUDED A 0.6 POINT INCREASE DUE TO THE IMPACT FROM THE WINDPOOL

ASSESSMENTS AND REINSTATEMENT PREMIUMS. ADJUSTING FOR THESE FACTORS IN BOTH YEARS, THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO FOR 2009 WAS 0.6 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2008 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF THE DECLINE IN FEE INCOME COMPARED WITH 2008. A PORTION OF FEE INCOME IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF EXPENSES FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE EXPENSE RATIO.

DECREASED BY 4% AND 3% FROM 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIFFERENCE IN RATES OF DECLINE BETWEEN GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2010 AND 2009 WAS CONCENTRATED IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR PRODUCTS OFFERED BY BOTH DISCOVER RE AND RESIDUAL MARKETS IS CEDED TO OTHER INSURERS AND RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS. AS A RESULT, THE DECLINE IN GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS DID NOT

HAVE A PROPORTIONAL IMPACT ON NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS. THE DECLINE IN GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2010 AND 2009 WAS DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY LOWER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT IMPACTED EXPOSURE

CHANGES AT RENEWAL, AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, POLICY ENDORSEMENTS AND MID-TERM CANCELLATIONS.

IN

2009, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $1.57 BILLION WERE 2% LOWER THAN IN 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INLAND MARINE AND OCEAN MARINE BUSINESS UNITS, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF GENERAL

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME OF $620 MILLION IN 2010 WAS $22 MILLION, OR 3%, LOWER THAN IN 2009, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN

CATASTROPHE LOSSES, NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AS WELL AS LOWER BUSINESS VOLUMES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 AND 2009 TOTALED $259 MILLION AND $168 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2010

AND 2009 TOTALED $82 MILLION AND $3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN

2009, OPERATING INCOME OF $642 MILLION WAS $7 MILLION, OR 1%, LOWER THAN IN 2008. A REDUCTION IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY A

DECLINE IN THE COST OF CATASTROPHES AND LOWER LARGE LOSSES IN INTERNATIONAL. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $168 MILLION AND $274 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. THE COST OF CATASTROPHES TOTALED $3 MILLION AND $84 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

EARNED PREMIUMS

EARNED PREMIUMS OF $3.32 BILLION IN 2010 WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN IN 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF INTENTIONAL

UNDERWRITING ACTIONS TAKEN AND COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY BUSINESS UNIT AND IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATION AT LLOYD'S. THESE FACTORS WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER

REINSURANCE COSTS, THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY'S REINSURANCE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 THAT MODESTLY INCREASED RETENTIONS TO DIRECTIONALLY ALIGN RETENTIONS IN THE

COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS WITH ITS U.S. PRACTICES, AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. EARNED PREMIUMS OF $3.33 BILLION IN 2009 DECLINED $96 MILLION, OR

3%, FROM THE 2008 TOTAL DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ADJUSTING FOR THE IMPACT OF

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2010 DECREASED BY $13 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2009. INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL &

INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT ARE CERTAIN LEGAL ENTITIES WHOSE INVESTED ASSETS AND RELATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME ARE REPORTED EXCLUSIVELY IN THIS SEGMENT AND NOT ALLOCATED AMONG ALL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. AS A RESULT, REPORTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER PROPORTION OF ALLOCATED NET INVESTMENT

INCOME, INCLUDING THAT FROM THE COMPANY'S NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THAT EXPERIENCED A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2010. REFER TO THE "NET INVESTMENT INCOME" SECTION

OF "CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" HEREIN FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2010 AND 2009 AS COMPARED WITH THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEARS. IN

ADDITION, REFER TO NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY. IN 2009, THE SLIGHT DECLINE

IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME COMPARED WITH 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH REDUCED REPORTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY

$18 MILLION IN 2009.

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2010 TOTALED $1.70 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $47 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM 2009,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OFFSET BY INCREASES IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE 2009

TOTAL INCLUDED AN INCREASE IN RESERVES FOR A NON-RENEWED PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY PROGRAM IN IRELAND. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $259 MILLION AND

$168 MILLION IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY IN BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE

SURETY AND MANAGEMENT LIABILITY LINES OF BUSINESS DUE TO LOWER THAN EXPECTED CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS SEVERITY IN THE 2008 AND PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS. IN INTERNATIONAL, THE MAJORITY OF NET FAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 OCCURRED AT THE COMPANY'S OPERATION AT LLOYD'S, IN CANADA AND IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2010 AND 2009 TOTALED $82 MILLION AND

$3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AN EARTHQUAKE IN CHILE ACCOUNTED FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CATASTROPHE LOSSES INCURRED IN 2010.

CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2009 TOTALED $1.75 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $22 MILLION, OR 1%, FROM 2008. THE DECREASE IN 2009 WAS DRIVEN BY A $73 MILLION

FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. A DECREASE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND LARGE LOSSES IN INTERNATIONAL.

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $168 MILLION AND $274 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2009 WAS DRIVEN BY

BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN INTERNATIONAL, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CANADA. IN ADDITION, THE AVIATION AND PROPERTY LINES OF BUSINESS AT LLOYD'S EXPERIENCED NET FAVORABLE

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2009. IN BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS, BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CONTRACT SURETY BUSINESS WITHIN THE FIDELITY AND SURETY PRODUCT LINE FOR

RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS ALSO RESULTED IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2009. THE CATASTROPHE LOSSES INCLUDED IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2009 TOTALED $3 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH $73 MILLION IN 2008.

NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $274 MILLION IN 2008, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN INTERNATIONAL. THE IMPROVEMENTS IN

LONGER-TAIL LINES OF BUSINESS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING ENHANCED RISK CONTROL AND UNDERWRITING STRATEGIES THROUGHOUT INTERNATIONAL. IN THE PROPERTY LINE OF BUSINESS,

THE IMPROVEMENT PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, IN PART DUE TO FAVORABLE CLAIM ACTIVITY

GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2010 TOTALED $608 MILLION, $29 MILLION, OR 5%, HIGHER THAN THE 2009 TOTAL OF $579 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN 2010 PRIMARILY

REFLECTED INCREASES IN EMPLOYEE- AND TECHNOLOGY-RELATED COSTS TO ENHANCE OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT FUTURE BUSINESS GROWTH. IN 2009, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF $579 MILLION WERE

SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE 2008 TOTAL OF $581 MILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH INITIATIVES.

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2010 EXCLUDING CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS 0.8 POINTS LOWER THAN THE 2009 RATIO ON THE SAME BASIS,

REFLECTING LOWER REINSURANCE COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THE 2009 RATIO REFLECTED A RESERVE INCREASE FOR A

NON-RENEWED PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY PROGRAM IN IRELAND.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 36.8% IN 2010 WAS 0.8 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 36.0% IN 2009. THE INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF INCREASES IN

COMMERCIAL SURETY GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME DECLINED IN 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET ON A NET BASIS BY A

REDUCTION IN REINSURANCE COSTS. IN INTERNATIONAL, THE 1% DECLINE IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF INTENTIONAL UNDERWRITING ACTIONS AND COMPETITIVE

MARKET CONDITIONS. THOSE FACTORS WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY'S REINSURANCE THAT MODESTLY INCREASED RETENTIONS TO DIRECTIONALLY ALIGN RETENTIONS IN THE COMPANY'S

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS WITH ITS U.S. PRACTICES, AS WELL AS THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. IN LATE 2008, THE COMPANY COMMENCED AN EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH A BROKER IN THE

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE 2009 VOLUME OF PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE COVERAGE WRITTEN AND ALSO RESULTED IN THE COMPANY WRITING PERSONAL HOUSEHOLD COVERAGES. THE COMPANY CEASED

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN INTERNATIONAL. THE REMAINDER OF THE DECLINE WAS DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN ON CONSTRUCTION AND COMMERCIAL SURETY BUSINESS VOLUME, UNDERWRITING ACTIONS TAKEN AND COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND PUBLIC COMPANY LIABILITY COMPONENTS OF

LOWER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN 2010 DECLINED FROM 2009, WHICH REFLECTED INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS IN 2010. FOR INTERNATIONAL (ALSO EXCLUDING THE SURETY LINE

OF BUSINESS), BUSINESS RETENTION RATES IN 2010 DECLINED FROM 2009. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN INTERNATIONAL ALSO DECLINED IN 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO INTENTIONAL UNDERWRITING ACTIONS AND THE TERMINATION OF

LOSSES IN 2010 RESULTED FROM SEVERAL SEVERE WIND AND HAIL STORMS. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 AND 2009 TOTALED $87 MILLION AND $135 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER PRODUCT LINE, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE 2008 AND PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS,

PRIMARILY FOR THE UMBRELLA LINE OF BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE 2009 ACCIDENT YEAR FOR THE HOMEOWNERS LINE OF BUSINESS THAT WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED

LATE-REPORTED CLAIMS RELATED TO STORMS IN 2009.

IN

2009, CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES OF $4.62 BILLION WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IN 2008, AS THE IMPACTS OF LOSS COST TRENDS AND INCREASED BUSINESS VOLUME WERE LARGELY

WILDFIRES.

NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA AND BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FROM RECENT

ACCIDENT YEARS FOR THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER PRODUCT LINE. THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN IN PART BY CLAIM INITIATIVES AS WELL AS BETTER THAN EXPECTED OUTCOMES ON 2007 CATASTROPHE-RELATED CLAIMS. IN

ADDITION, THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER PRODUCT LINE EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENT IN OLDER ACCIDENT YEARS FOR THE UMBRELLA LINE AS WELL AS FAVORABLE EXPERIENCE FROM ACCIDENT YEAR 2007 FOR ALLIED COVERAGES DUE

TO LESS THAN EXPECTED CLAIM ACTIVITY.

THE

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS TOTALED $1.44 BILLION IN 2010, COMPARED WITH $1.42 BILLION IN 2009 AND $1.41 BILLION IN 2008. THE INCREASES IN 2010

AND 2009 OVER THE PRECEDING YEAR WERE CONSISTENT WITH EARNED PREMIUM INCREASES IN BOTH YEARS.

GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF $867 MILLION IN 2010 WERE $83 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2009. THE TOTAL IN 2009 REFLECTED A $48 MILLION REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATE

OF PROPERTY WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO HURRICANE IKE. ADJUSTING FOR THE IMPACT OF THE REDUCTION IN WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS IN 2009, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2010 INCREASED

$35 MILLION, OR 4%, OVER 2009, PRIMARILY

IN

2009, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF $784 MILLION WERE $45 MILLION LOWER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2008 TOTAL OF $829 MILLION. THE DECREASE RESULTED FROM

REVISED ESTIMATES OF WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO HURRICANE IKE. DURING 2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED $77 MILLION OF ESTIMATED PROPERTY WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT IN

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SUBSEQUENTLY, DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $48 MILLION REDUCTION IN THESE ESTIMATED ASSESSMENTS DUE TO A DECLINE IN ESTIMATED

INSURANCE INDUSTRY LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE IKE. ADJUSTING FOR THE IMPACT OF WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS IN BOTH 2009 AND 2008, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2009 INCREASED 11%, OVER 2008,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE.

GAAP COMBINED RATIO

THE GAAP COMBINED RATIO OF 98.3% IN 2010 WAS 3.7 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE GAAP COMBINED RATIO OF 94.6% IN 2009.

THE

LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 68.1% IN 2010 WAS 3.1 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2009 RATIO OF 65.0%. CATASTROPHE LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR 8.1 AND 3.9 POINTS OF THE LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS FOR 2010 AND 2009 INCLUDED 1.2 POINT AND 1.9 POINT BENEFITS, RESPECTIVELY, FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO EXCLUDING CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 WAS 1.8 POINTS LOWER THAN THE 2009 RATIO ON THE SAME BASIS,

REFLECTING THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF EARNED RATE INCREASES OUTPACING LOSS COST TRENDS AND A REDUCTION IN NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 30.2% IN 2010 WAS 0.6 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 29.6% IN 2009. THE 2009 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO INCLUDED A 0.7 POINT

BENEFIT FROM THE REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATE OF WINDPOOL ASSESSMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

THE

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS THAT HAVE

ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN NEW ASBESTOS CLAIMS OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM THE COMPANY'S POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY), INCLUDING CLAIMS

AGAINST THE COMPANY'S POLICYHOLDERS BY INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT APPEAR TO BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE. FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING

ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS AND THE FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. THE FOCUS ON THESE DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE

SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES BY INITIALLY

DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. THE BANKRUPTCY OF MANY TRADITIONAL DEFENDANTS HAS ALSO CAUSED

INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT THAT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO

CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING

DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET. THIS TREND OF PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE EXPERIENCE ALSO HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF

OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR

A PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED

AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDER'S FAVOR

AND OTHER COMPANY DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, THE COMPANY'S COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE

PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE

NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS SEEN A MODERATION IN THE OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

MANY

COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

92

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SETTLEMENT

NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN

ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. THERE ALSO MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE A COURT MAY NOT APPROVE A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FOR THE

COMPANY. AS IN THE PAST, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN

ADDITION TO CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO

THE HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST

INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS

BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THESE CLAIMS AND HAS RECEIVED FAVORABLE RULINGS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.

TRAVELERS

PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC), A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, HAD ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES, IN CONNECTION

WITH A NUMBER OF THESE DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS. THESE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS HAD BEEN APPROVED BY THE COURT IN CONNECTION WITH PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY TPC IN THE JOHNS MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY COURT. ON

MARCH 29, 2006, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SUBSTANTIALLY AFFIRMED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT'S ORDERS, WHILE VACATING THAT PORTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT'S ORDERS

WHICH REQUIRED ALL FUTURE DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST TPC TO FIRST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT BEFORE PROCEEDING IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. VARIOUS PARTIES APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURT'S RULING TO

THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. ON FEBRUARY 15, 2008, THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED AN OPINION VACATING ON JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS THE DISTRICT COURT'S APPROVAL OF THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT'S ORDER THAT BARRED THE FILING OF CERTAIN DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS AGAINST TPC IN THE FUTURE. TPC AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTIES FILED PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

SEEKING REVIEW OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S DECISION. THOSE PETITIONS WERE GRANTED AND ON JUNE 18, 2009, THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY, REVERSING THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S DECISION.

HOWEVER, SINCE THE SECOND CIRCUIT HAD NOT RULED ON SEVERAL ADDITIONAL ISSUES PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO PROCEDURAL MATTERS AND THE ADEQUACY OF NOTICE PROVIDED TO CERTAIN PARTIES, THE SUPREME COURT

REMANDED THE CASE TO THE SECOND CIRCUIT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS ON THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES. ON MARCH 22, 2010, THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED AN OPINION IN WHICH IT FOUND THAT THE NOTICE OF THE 1986

ORDERS PROVIDED TO THE REMAINING OBJECTOR WAS INSUFFICIENT TO BAR CONTRIBUTION CLAIMS BY THAT OBJECTOR AGAINST TPC. ON APRIL 5, 2010, TPC FILED A PETITION FOR REHEARING AND REHEARING

EN BANC

WITH

THE SECOND CIRCUIT, REQUESTING FURTHER REVIEW OF ITS MARCH 22, 2010 OPINION, WHICH WAS DENIED ON MAY 25, 2010. ON

AUGUST 18, 2010, TPC FILED A PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SEEKING REVIEW OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S MARCH 22, 2010 OPINION, AND A PETITION FOR A WRIT

OF MANDAMUS SEEKING AN ORDER FROM THE SUPREME COURT REQUIRING THE SECOND CIRCUIT TO COMPLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT'S JUNE 18, 2009 RULING IN TPC'S FAVOR. THE SUPREME COURT DENIED THE PETITIONS

ON NOVEMBER 29, 2010. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS ACTIONS (AS DEFINED IN NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) FILED MOTIONS

TO COMPEL WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2010 AND SEPTEMBER 3, 2010, RESPECTIVELY, ARGUING THAT ALL CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE SETTLEMENTS HAVE BEEN MET AND SEEKING TO

REQUIRE TPC TO PAY THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS. ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2010, TPC FILED AN OPPOSITION TO THE PLAINTIFFS' MOTIONS TO COMPEL ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE SETTLEMENTS,

PRINCIPALLY THE REQUIREMENT THAT ALL CONTRIBUTION CLAIMS BE BARRED, HAVE NOT BEEN MET IN LIGHT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S MARCH 22, 2010 OPINION. ON DECEMBER 16, 2010, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

GRANTED THE PLAINTIFFS' MOTIONS AND RULED THAT TPC WAS REQUIRED TO FUND THE SETTLEMENTS. ON JANUARY 20, 2011, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS DECEMBER 16,

2010 RULING AND ORDERED TPC TO PAY THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS PLUS PREJUDGMENT INTEREST. ON JANUARY 21, 2011, TPC FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

FROM THE

93

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BANKRUPTCY

COURT'S JANUARY 20, 2011 JUDGMENT. (FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THESE MATTERS, SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

BECAUSE

EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AT LEAST ANNUALLY. AMONG THE FACTORS

WHICH THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER IN THE COURSE OF THIS REVIEW ARE: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS

AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT

VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN

ANY RESOLUTION

PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE

LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM.

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IN-DEPTH ASBESTOS CLAIM REVIEW AND NOTED THE CONTINUATION OF RECENT TRENDS, WHICH

INCLUDE.



CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY INVOLVING INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS ASBESTOS-RELATED ILLNESS;



STABLE PAYMENT PATTERNS FOR A LARGE PROPORTION OF POLICYHOLDERS;



A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE ASBESTOS EXPOSURES CONFRONTING THE COMPANY DUE TO ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY;



CONTINUED MODERATE LEVEL OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCY ACTIVITY; AND



THE ABSENCE OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR NEW CLASSES OF DEFENDANTS.

WHILE

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE TRENDS INDICATE A REDUCTION IN THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S OVERALL ASBESTOS EXPOSURE, THERE NONETHELESS REMAINS A HIGH DEGREE OF

UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE FROM ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

THE

COMPANY'S QUARTERLY ASBESTOS RESERVE REVIEW INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANALYZES DEVELOPING PAYMENT PATTERNS AMONG POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE, FIELD OFFICE AND ASSUMED REINSURANCE AND OTHER

CATEGORIES AS WELL AS PROJECTED REINSURANCE BILLINGS AND RECOVERIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE,

YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY

EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES NOR HAVE THE COMPANY'S

EVALUATIONS RESULTED IN ANY WAY OF DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY PAYMENT.

AS

IN PRIOR YEARS, THE ANNUAL CLAIM REVIEW CONSIDERED ACTIVE POLICYHOLDERS AND LITIGATION CASES FOR POTENTIAL PRODUCT AND "NON-PRODUCT" LIABILITY. COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR PERIOD, THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE CATEGORIES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICYHOLDERS WITH ACTIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS, EXPERIENCED AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS WHO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WERE TENDERING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. HOWEVER, GROSS DEFENSE AND INDEMNITY PAYMENT PATTERNS IN THESE CATEGORIES REMAINED CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE COMPANY HAS

EXPERIENCED IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WHERE INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS ASBESTOS-RELATED INJURY CONTINUE TO TARGET PREVIOUSLY

PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS.

THE

COMPLETION OF THESE REVIEWS AND ANALYSES IN THE THIRD QUARTER RESULTED IN A NET $140 MILLION INCREASE IN THE COMPANY'S ASBESTOS RESERVES, DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN THE COMPANY'S

ESTIMATE OF 1) PROJECTED SETTLEMENT AND DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO A BROAD NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS; 2) COSTS OF LITIGATING ASBESTOS-RELATED COVERAGE MATTERS; AND 3) PROJECTED

PAYMENTS ON ASSUMED REINSURANCE

94

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACCOUNTS.

THIS INCREASE INCLUDED A $70 MILLION BENEFIT FROM THE REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RESULTING FROM A RECENT FAVORABLE RULING RELATED TO A REINSURANCE

DISPUTE AND AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. IN 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $185 MILLION INCREASE IN ASBESTOS RESERVES, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE COMPANY'S

ASSUMPTION FOR PROJECTED DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO MANY POLICYHOLDERS. THE COMPANY RECORDED A $70 MILLION INCREASE TO ASBESTOS RESERVES IN 2008, WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY A CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATING ASBESTOS COVERAGE MATTERS AND A CHANGE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDERS. OVERALL, THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF THE UNDERLYING ASBESTOS

ENVIRONMENT DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM RECENT PERIODS.

NET

ASBESTOS LOSSES PAID IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WERE $350 MILLION, $341 MILLION AND $658 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. (ASBESTOS PAYMENTS IN 2008 INCLUDED THE COMPANY'S

ONE-TIME NET PAYMENT OF $365 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ACANDS, INC. MATTER). APPROXIMATELY 32%, 41% AND 59% OF TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES IN 2010, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANY'S LIABILITY.

THE

"POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS" CATEGORY INCLUDES STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS, COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS AND, WITH RESPECT TO TPC, WELLINGTON ACCOUNTS. RESERVES ARE BASED

ON THE EXPECTED PAYOUT FOR EACH POLICYHOLDER UNDER THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENT. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS ARE ARRANGEMENTS UNDER WHICH POLICYHOLDERS AND/OR PLAINTIFFS AGREE TO FIXED FINANCIAL AMOUNTS TO BE

PAID AT SCHEDULED TIMES. INCLUDED IN THIS CATEGORY ARE TPC'S RESERVES FOR THE SETTLEMENTS OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS. (FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THESE MATTERS, SEE

NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS REPRESENT AGREEMENTS WITH POLICYHOLDERS ON SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE TO BE PROVIDED. PAYMENT

OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL MAXIMUMS AND ARE ONLY MADE WHEN VALID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED. WELLINGTON ACCOUNTS REFER TO THE 35 DEFENDANTS THAT ARE PARTIES TO A 1985 AGREEMENT SETTLING CERTAIN

DISPUTES CONCERNING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEIR ASBESTOS CLAIMS. MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF THE WELLINGTON AGREEMENT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE

AGREED ON SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE AND THE TERMS UNDER WHICH THE COVERAGE CAN BE ACCESSED.

THE

"HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE" CATEGORY RELATES TO ALL OTHER POLICYHOLDERS AND ALSO INCLUDES UNALLOCATED IBNR RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR THE COSTS OF DEFENDING ASBESTOS-RELATED

COVERAGE LITIGATION. POLICYHOLDERS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR THE ANNUAL HOME OFFICE REVIEW BASED UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: A COMBINATION OF PAST PAYMENTS AND CURRENT CASE RESERVES IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED

THRESHOLD (CURRENTLY $100,000), PERCEIVED LEVEL OF EXPOSURE, NUMBER OF REPORTED CLAIMS, PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATIONS AND POTENTIAL "NON-PRODUCT" EXPOSURES, SIZE OF POLICYHOLDER AND

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD BY THE POLICYHOLDER. IN ADDITION TO IBNR AMOUNTS CONTAINED IN THE RESERVES FOR "HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE" POLICYHOLDERS AND THE COSTS OF

LITIGATING ASBESTOS COVERAGE MATTERS, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A RESERVE FOR FURTHER ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS, NEW CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS REPORTING CLAIMS FOR THE

FIRST TIME AND POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH THERE IS, OR MAY BE, LITIGATION AND DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE "ASSUMED REINSURANCE AND OTHER" CATEGORY PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF REINSURANCE OF EXCESS

COVERAGE, INCLUDING VARIOUS POOL PARTICIPATIONS.

ON

JANUARY 29, 2009, THE COMPANY AND PPG INDUSTRIES, INC ("PPG"), ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY 30 OTHER INSURERS OF PPG, AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE ASBESTOS-RELATED

COVERAGE LITIGATION UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO PPG. THE TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE MODIFIED THIRD AMENDED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION ("AMENDED PLAN") PROPOSED AS

PART OF THE PITTSBURGH CORNING CORP. ("PCC", WHICH IS 50% OWNED BY PPG) BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. PURSUANT TO THE PROPOSED AMENDED PLAN, WHICH WAS FILED ON JANUARY 30, 2009, PCC, ALONG WITH

ENUMERATED OTHER COMPANIES (INCLUDING PPG AS WELL AS THE COMPANY AS A PARTICIPATING INSURER), ARE TO RECEIVE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE FROM CERTAIN

ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO MAKE A SERIES OF PAYMENTS OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY

$620 MILLION TO THE TRUST TO BE CREATED UNDER THE AMENDED PLAN, OR IT MAY ELECT TO MAKE A ONE-TIME DISCOUNTED PAYMENT, WHICH, AS OF MARCH 31, 2011, WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY

$454 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $425 MILLION AFTER REINSURANCE). THE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH PPG IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE AMENDED PLAN,

AND THE COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT UNTIL ALL CONTINGENCIES ARE SATISFIED. THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE ARE INCLUDED IN THE "HOME OFFICE AND

FIELD OFFICE" CATEGORY IN THE PRECEDING TABLE.

IN

DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA, WHICH COMPRISED ITS UNITED KINGDOM-BASED RUNOFF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES. INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES TRANSFERRED TO THE PURCHASER WERE GROSS AND NET ASBESTOS RESERVES OF $330 MILLION AND $232 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR

ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO

RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN

REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS

HAVE INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY THE COMPANY

PRIOR TO THE MID-1980S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT

BEING SOUGHT BY

THE CLAIMANT FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

THE

RESOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES BY THE COMPANY GENERALLY OCCURS BY SETTLEMENT ON A POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS AS OPPOSED TO A

CLAIM-BY-CLAIM BASIS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY STRIVES TO EXTINGUISH ANY OBLIGATIONS IT MAY HAVE UNDER ANY POLICY ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER FOR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXTINGUISH ANY PENDING COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTE WITH THE POLICYHOLDER. THIS FORM OF SETTLEMENT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A "BUY-BACK" OF POLICIES FOR

FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE AGREEMENTS HAVE ALSO EXTINGUISHED ANY INSURANCE OBLIGATION WHICH THE COMPANY MAY HAVE FOR OTHER CLAIMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ASBESTOS

AND OTHER CUMULATIVE INJURY CLAIMS. THE COMPANY AND ITS POLICYHOLDERS MAY ALSO AGREE TO SETTLEMENTS WHICH EXTINGUISH ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM KNOWN SPECIFIED SITES OR CLAIMS. WHERE APPROPRIATE,

THESE AGREEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE INDEMNITIES AND HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S GENERAL PURPOSE IN EXECUTING THESE AGREEMENTS IS TO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE AND ELIMINATE THE RISKS PRESENTED BY COVERAGE LITIGATION WITH THE POLICYHOLDER AND RELATED COSTS.

IN

ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS,

THE COMPANY GENERALLY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF SIMILAR EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY

VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE ALLEGATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP

AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED

TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES.

IN

ITS REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS: PAST SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS; CHANGING JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE TRENDS; ITS RESERVES FOR THE COSTS OF LITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL

COVERAGE MATTERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR POLICYHOLDERS WITH SMALLER EXPOSURES TO BE NAMED IN NEW CLEAN-UP ACTIONS FOR

97

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BOTH

ON- AND OFF-SITE WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES; THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT; THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL NEW CLAIMS BEYOND PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS; AND THE POTENTIAL

HIGHER COSTS FOR NEW SETTLEMENTS.

THE

DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE EXTENT OF TIME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE ESTIMATE, IF ANY, OF THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM TO THE

COMPANY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND ARE DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE COOPERATION OF THE POLICYHOLDER IN PROVIDING CLAIM INFORMATION, THE PACE OF

UNDERLYING LITIGATION OR CLAIM PROCESSES, THE PACE OF COVERAGE LITIGATION BETWEEN THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY TO NEGOTIATE, IF APPROPRIATE,

A RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE PERTAINING TO THESE CLAIMS. BECAUSE THESE FACTORS VARY FROM CLAIM-TO-CLAIM AND POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY

CANNOT PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE OF THE DURATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM. HOWEVER, BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THESE CLAIMS, THE DURATION MAY VARY FROM MONTHS TO SEVERAL

YEARS.

ALTHOUGH

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE NOTICES FROM POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE NUMBER OF NEW POLICYHOLDERS SUBMITTING THOSE NOTICES DECLINED FROM 2009.

THESE POLICYHOLDERS CONTINUE TO PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE LOWER TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, IN MANY INSTANCES CLEAN-UP COSTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE REGULATORY

AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT RISK-BASED SITE ANALYSES AND MORE EFFICIENT CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED MODEST UPWARD DEVELOPMENT IN THE EXPECTED

DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PENDING POLICYHOLDERS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $35 MILLION IN 2010. DURING 2009, THE COMPANY

EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IN THE NUMBER OF PENDING ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED COVERAGE ACTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED

UPWARD DEVELOPMENT IN THE EXPECTED DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PENDING POLICYHOLDERS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $70 MILLION IN

2009. IN 2008, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $85 MILLION AS A RESULT OF UPWARD DEVELOPMENT IN THE ANTICIPATED DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PENDING

POLICYHOLDERS.

IN

DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA, WHICH COMPRISED ITS UNITED KINGDOM-BASED RUNOFF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES. INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES TRANSFERRED TO THE PURCHASER WERE GROSS AND NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES OF $40 MILLION AND $33 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

NET

ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES PAID IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WERE $77 MILLION, $91 MILLION AND $128 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY 93% OF

THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $327 MILLION) WAS CARRIED IN A BULK RESERVE AND INCLUDED UNRESOLVED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE

ANTICIPATED COST OF COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTES RELATING TO THESE CLAIMS. THE BULK RESERVE THE COMPANY CARRIES IS ESTABLISHED AND ADJUSTED BASED UPON THE AGGREGATE VOLUME OF IN-PROCESS

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THOSE CLAIMS. THE BALANCE, APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION), CONSISTS OF CASE

RESERVES.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY

IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE, AND/OR THE NUMBER OF, ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF

AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY,

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO

POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS. IN ADDITION, UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF

POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR JUDICIAL REFORMS

ESTABLISHING MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT

99

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO

PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS

ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE.

AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS. (ALSO SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 TOTALED $72.72 BILLION, OF WHICH 94% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY

AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, 1% IN EQUITY SECURITIES, 1% IN REAL ESTATE AND 4% IN OTHER INVESTMENTS. BECAUSE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS TO FUND FUTURE CLAIMS

PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID

TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL AND TAXABLE CORPORATE AND U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS.

THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 TOTALED $62.82 BILLION. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY

INVESTMENTS, AND INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES ARE EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE CREDIT

QUALITY OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, BOTH INCLUDING AND EXCLUDING U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, WAS "AA2" AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES

REPRESENTED 3.0% AND 2.7% OF THE TOTAL FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF FIXED MATURITIES AND

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WAS 3.6 (3.9 EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM SECURITIES) AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 3.9 (4.2 EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM SECURITIES) AT DECEMBER 31,

2009. THE DECLINE IN DURATION PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE IMPACT OF DECLINING MARKET YIELDS AND TIGHTENING INVESTMENT SPREADS ON EXISTING HOLDINGS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (WHICH IMPACT THE

ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO OPTIONAL PRE-PAYMENTS), AN INCREASE IN PRE-REFUNDED MUNICIPAL BONDS AND GENERAL PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.

OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS

$41.33 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES WHICH ARE OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO). THE MUNICIPAL

BOND PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND PUERTO RICO AND INCLUDES GENERAL OBLIGATION AND REVENUE BONDS ISSUED BY STATES, CITIES, COUNTIES, SCHOOL DISTRICTS

AND SIMILAR ISSUERS. INCLUDED IN THE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE $7.29 BILLION AND $6.06 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ADVANCE REFUNDED OR

ESCROWED-TO-MATURITY BONDS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS PRE-REFUNDED BONDS), WHICH ARE BONDS FOR WHICH AN IRREVOCABLE TRUST HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO FUND THE

REMAINING PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. SUCH ESCROW ACCOUNTS ARE VERIFIED AS TO THEIR SUFFICIENCY BY AN EXTERNAL AUDITOR AND ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY COMPRISED OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. MOODY'S

INVESTORS SERVICE HAS ASSIGNED A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK TO MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ISSUED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.

THE

COMPANY BASES ITS INVESTMENT DECISION ON THE CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MUNICIPAL SECURITY; HOWEVER, ITS MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF SECURITIES THAT WERE

ENHANCED BY THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF AN ISSUER DEFAULT. THE DOWNGRADE DURING 2009 AND 2008 OF CREDIT RATINGS OF INSURERS OF THESE SECURITIES

RESULTED IN A CORRESPONDING DOWNGRADE IN THE RATINGS OF THE SECURITIES TO THE UNDERLYING RATING OF THE RESPECTIVE SECURITY. OF THE INSURED MUNICIPAL SECURITIES IN THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY 99% WERE RATED AT A3 OR ABOVE, AND APPROXIMATELY 90% WERE RATED AT AA3 OR ABOVE, WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A LOSS OF THE

BENEFIT OF INSURANCE WOULD NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE UNDERLYING CREDIT STRENGTH OF THE ISSUERS OF THE

SECURITIES, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITIES. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE UNDERLYING ISSUERS OF THESE SECURITIES WAS "AA2" AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE

AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE ENTIRE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO WAS "AA1" AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WITH AND WITHOUT THE THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE.

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS AND PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES

THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 INCLUDED $4.16 BILLION AND

$5.21 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES INCLUDING PASS-THROUGH-SECURITIES AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMO), ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

PREPAYMENT RISK (EITHER SHORTENING OR LENGTHENING OF DURATION). WHILE PREPAYMENT RISK FOR BOTH GUARANTEED AND NON-GUARANTEED SECURITIES AND ITS EFFECT ON INCOME CANNOT BE FULLY CONTROLLED,

PARTICULARLY WHEN INTEREST RATES MOVE DRAMATICALLY, THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY GENERALLY FAVORS SECURITIES THAT CONTROL THIS RISK WITHIN EXPECTED INTEREST RATE RANGES. INCLUDED IN THE TOTALS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE $2.09 BILLION AND $2.63 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF GNMA,

FNMA AND FHLMC (EXCLUDING FHA PROJECT LOANS) GUARANTEED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE. ALSO INCLUDED IN THOSE TOTALS WERE RESIDENTIAL

CMOS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $2.07 BILLION AND $2.58 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. APPROXIMATELY 38% AND 37% OF THE COMPANY'S CMO HOLDINGS WERE GUARANTEED BY OR

FULLY COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES ISSUED BY GNMA, FNMA OR FHLMC AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF ALL OF THE ABOVE SECURITIES WAS "AA1" AT BOTH

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009.

THE

COMPANY MAKES INVESTMENTS IN RESIDENTIAL CMOS THAT ARE EITHER GUARANTEED BY GNMA, FNMA OR FHLMC, OR IF NOT GUARANTEED, ARE SENIOR OR SUPER-SENIOR POSITIONS WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE

SECURITIZATIONS. BOTH GUARANTEED AND NON-GUARANTEED RESIDENTIAL CMOS ALLOCATE THE DISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS FROM THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES AMONG DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BONDHOLDERS. IN

ADDITION, NON-GUARANTEED RESIDENTIAL CMOS PROVIDE STRUCTURES THAT ALLOCATE THE IMPACT OF CREDIT LOSSES TO DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BONDHOLDERS. SENIOR AND SUPER-SENIOR CMOS ARE PROTECTED, TO

VARYING DEGREES, FROM CREDIT LOSSES AS THOSE LOSSES ARE INITIALLY ALLOCATED TO SUBORDINATED BONDHOLDERS. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO PURCHASE CMO TRANCHES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OFFER THE

MOST FAVORABLE RETURN GIVEN THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF ASSOCIATED RISKS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PURCHASE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN CMOS.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND PROJECT LOANS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HELD COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (INCLUDING FHA PROJECT LOANS) OF

$549 MILLION AND $714 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS PORTFOLIO EXPOSES IT TO A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE "MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS AND PASS-THROUGH

SECURITIES" AND "ASSET-BACKED AND OTHER" CATEGORIES IN THE FOREGOING TABLE INCLUDED COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS BACKED BY ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION MORTGAGES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

COLLATERALIZED BY

SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES WITH A COLLECTIVE FAIR VALUE OF $297 MILLION AND $270 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 0.5% AND 0.4% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL FIXED MATURITY

INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY). THE DISRUPTION IN SECONDARY INVESTMENT MARKETS FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES PROVIDED THE COMPANY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELECTIVELY

ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL SUCH SECURITIES AT DISCOUNTED PRICES. THE COMPANY PURCHASED $31 MILLION AND $74 MILLION OF SUCH SECURITIES IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009,

RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DEFINES SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AS INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY EXHIBIT ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: LOW FICO

SCORES, ABOVE-PRIME INTEREST RATES, HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS OR HIGH DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIOS. ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION SECURITIZATIONS ARE THOSE IN

WHICH THE UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES' REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT SCORE BUT DO NOT MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES' GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION, PROPERTY

TYPE, DEBT AND LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING ON THESE SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS HELD BY THE COMPANY WAS "BAA2" AND "A3" AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009,

RESPECTIVELY.

SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THESE INVESTED ASSET

CLASSES.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER INVESTMENTS WAS $2.93 BILLION AND

$2.95 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY'S OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, MORTGAGE

LOANS, VENTURE CAPITAL (THROUGH DIRECT OWNERSHIP AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS) AND TRADING SECURITIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO MORE VOLATILITY THAN THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. THESE ASSET

CLASSES HAVE HISTORICALLY PROVIDED A HIGHER RETURN THAN FIXED MATURITIES BUT ARE SUBJECT TO MORE VOLATILITY. NET INVESTMENT INCOME PROVIDED BY THESE ASSET CLASSES TOTALED $304 MILLION IN 2010,

COMPARED WITH NEGATIVE NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF $106 MILLION AND $292 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE NEGATIVE NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2009 AND 2008 REFLECTED MARKET

CONDITIONS.

SECURITIES LENDING

THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES NET INVESTMENT INCOME BY LENDING CERTAIN OF ITS

INVESTMENTS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCURRED ANY INVESTMENT LOSSES IN ITS SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND

2008.

DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIOS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN VALUATIONS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR-END,

WHICH WERE OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET UNREALIZED APPRECIATION ON OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE COMPANY'S SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS REMAINING COMMON STOCK HOLDINGS IN

VERISK ANALYTICS, INC. THAT SALE GENERATED A PRETAX REALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN OF $205 MILLION IN 2010. THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMPANY'S NET UNREALIZED GAIN POSITION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 OVER THE PRIOR YEAR END IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. IN 2009, YIELDS ON MUNICIPAL FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES DECLINED, WHICH INCREASED THE MARKET VALUE OF

THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO OF SUCH SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, IN 2009 CREDIT SPREADS NARROWED ON OTHER NON-MUNICIPAL FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE MARKET

FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THE FOLLOWING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS.



$13 MILLION IN THE FIXED MATURITIES PORTFOLIO, CONSISTING OF $5 MILLION RELATED TO THE DETERIORATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OF VARIOUS ISSUERS, $4 MILLION RELATED TO STRUCTURED MORTGAGE SECURITIES AND $4 MILLION RELATED TO SECURITIES THAT THE COMPANY HAD THE INTENT TO SELL;



$3 MILLION IN THE EQUITY PORTFOLIO RELATED TO SECURITIES WITH RESPECT TO WHICH IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE COST

BASIS OF THOSE SECURITIES WOULD NOT BE RECOVERED OVER THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD; AND



$10 MILLION IN OTHER INVESTMENTS RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF VARIOUS ISSUERS.

IN

2008 AND 2009, WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS, AND THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES EXPERIENCED A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, RESULTING IN

HEIGHTENED CREDIT RISKS, REDUCED VALUATIONS OF INVESTMENTS AND DECREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THOSE FACTORS RESULTED IN THE HIGHER LEVEL OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INVESTMENT

IMPAIRMENTS RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY IN 2008 AND 2009.

PURCHASES

AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON CASH REQUIREMENTS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES INVESTMENTS TO

BE SOLD TO ACHIEVE ITS PRIMARY INVESTMENT GOALS OF ASSURING THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS TO OPTIMIZE INVESTMENT RETURNS, GIVEN THESE OBLIGATIONS.

CATASTROPHE MODELING

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING COMPUTER MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. THE COMPANY USES THESE ANALYSES AND METHODS TO MAKE UNDERWRITING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS.

IN

MAKING UNDERWRITING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS FOR HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE EXPOSURES, THE COMPANY USES THIRD-PARTY PROPRIETARY COMPUTER MODELING IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESTIMATE THE

LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LOSS FROM A SINGLE EVENT OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME WILL EQUAL OR EXCEED A PARTICULAR AMOUNT. THE TABLES BELOW SET FORTH THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITIES THAT LOSSES

FROM A SINGLE EVENT OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME WILL EQUAL OR EXCEED THE INDICATED LOSS AMOUNTS (EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY). FOR

EXAMPLE, ON THE BASIS DESCRIBED BELOW THE TABLES, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THERE IS A ONE PERCENT CHANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S LOSS FROM A SINGLE U.S. HURRICANE OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR

TIMEFRAME WOULD EQUAL OR EXCEED $1.1 BILLION, OR 5% OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

EVENT THAT HAS, FOR EXAMPLE, A 2% LIKELIHOOD OF EXCEEDANCE IS SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS A "1-IN-50 YEAR EVENT." AS NOTED

ABOVE, HOWEVER, THE PROBABILITIES IN THE TABLE REPRESENT THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSSES FROM A SINGLE EVENT EQUALING OR EXCEEDING THE INDICATED THRESHOLD

109

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOSS

AMOUNT IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME, NOT OVER A MULTI-YEAR TIMEFRAME. ALSO, BECAUSE THE PROBABILITIES RELATE TO A SINGLE EVENT, THE PROBABILITIES DO NOT ADDRESS THE LIKELIHOOD

OF MORE THAN ONE EVENT OCCURRING IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, AND, THEREFORE, THE AMOUNTS DO NOT ADDRESS POTENTIAL AGGREGATE CATASTROPHE LOSSES OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME.

(2)

THE

PERCENTAGE OF COMMON EQUITY IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING (A) INDICATED LOSS AMOUNTS IN DOLLARS BY (B) TOTAL COMMON EQUITY EXCLUDING NET

UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES. NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY BOTH DISCRETIONARY AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY

INDICATIVE OF OPERATING TRENDS. ACCORDINGLY, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, THE PERCENTAGE OF COMMON EQUITY CALCULATED ON THIS BASIS PROVIDES A USEFUL METRIC FOR INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND

THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A SINGLE HURRICANE OR SINGLE EARTHQUAKE ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE

THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS IN THE TABLES ABOVE ARE NET OF REINSURANCE, AFTER-TAX AND EXCLUDE MOST LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN LESS THAN 10% OF LOSS

ESTIMATES. THE AMOUNTS FOR HURRICANES REFLECT U.S. EXPOSURES AND INCLUDE PROPERTY EXPOSURES, PROPERTY RESIDUAL MARKET EXPOSURES AND AN ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN NON-PROPERTY EXPOSURES. THE

AMOUNTS FOR EARTHQUAKES REFLECT U.S. AND CANADIAN EXPOSURES AND INCLUDE PROPERTY EXPOSURES AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXPOSURES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE INCLUSION OF HURRICANE OR

EARTHQUAKE LOSSES ARISING FROM OTHER GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS OR OTHER EXPOSURES WOULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS. THIS INFORMATION IN THE TABLES IS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S

IN-FORCE PORTFOLIO AND CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE PROGRAM AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

CATASTROPHE

MODELING RELIES UPON INPUTS BASED ON EXPERIENCE, SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND HISTORY. THESE INPUTS REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGES WHICH MAY

RESULT IN VOLATILITY IN THE MODELED OUTPUT. CATASTROPHE MODELING OUTPUT MAY ALSO FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR RISKS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF NORMAL PROBABILITY OR ARE OTHERWISE UNFORESEEABLE. CATASTROPHE

MODELING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE PORTION OF PURCHASED REINSURANCE THAT IS COLLECTIBLE AFTER A CATASTROPHIC EVENT, WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE MATERIALLY INCORRECT. CONSEQUENTLY, CATASTROPHE

MODELING ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. IN THE TABLES ABOVE, THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE LIKELIHOOD OF

EXCEEDANCE DECREASES. IN OTHER WORDS, IN THE CASE OF A RELATIVELY MORE REMOTE EVENT (E.G., 1-IN-1,000), THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT IS RELATIVELY LESS RELIABLE.

ACTUAL LOSSES FROM AN EVENT COULD MATERIALLY EXCEED THE INDICATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT. IN ADDITION, MORE THAN ONE SUCH EVENT COULD OCCUR IN ANY PERIOD.

MOREOVER,

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF MATERIAL LOSSES FROM OTHER THAN PROPERTY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGES ARISING OUT OF HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, AND IT IS EXPOSED

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES FROM PERILS OTHER THAN HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, SUCH AS WINDSTORMS, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS, VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND ACTS OF TERRORISM.

THERE

ARE NO INDUSTRY-STANDARD METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS FOR PROJECTING CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE. ACCORDINGLY, CATASTROPHE ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY DIFFERENT INSURERS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE.

FOR

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, SEE "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSCATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE."

CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS

SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE UNDERSCORED THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE CLIMATE TRENDS AND CREATED

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING INSURERS' EXPOSURES TO FINANCIAL LOSS AS A RESULT OF CATASTROPHE AND OTHER WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS. SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT, IN RECENT YEARS, CHANGING

110

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLIMATE

CONDITIONS HAVE ADDED TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY, FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL DISASTERS. ACCORDINGLY, IF CLIMATE CONDITIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY'S CATASTROPHE MODELS MAY BE

LESS RELIABLE.

THE

COMPANY DISCUSSES HOW POTENTIALLY CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS MAY PRESENT OTHER ISSUES FOR ITS BUSINESS UNDER "RISK FACTORS" IN ITEM 1A OF THIS REPORT AND UNDER

"OUTLOOK" HEREIN. FOR EXAMPLE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.



INCREASINGLY UNPREDICTABLE AND SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CLAIMS UNDER

POLICIES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY. SEE "RISK FACTORSCATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE" AND "OUTLOOKUNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY."



SUCH CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD ALSO IMPACT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF ISSUERS OF SECURITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY

INVESTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WATER SUPPLY ADEQUACY COULD IMPACT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF BOND ISSUERS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES, AND MORE FREQUENT AND/OR SEVERE HURRICANES COULD IMPACT THE

CREDITWORTHINESS OF ISSUERS IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES., AMONG OTHER AREAS. SEE "RISK FACTORSOUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR MATERIAL LOSSES."



INCREASED REGULATION ADOPTED IN RESPONSE TO POTENTIAL CHANGES IN CLIMATE CONDITIONS MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY AND ITS

CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, STATE INSURANCE REGULATION COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE PROPERTY EXPOSURES IN AREAS VULNERABLE TO SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE DRIVEN LOSSES. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO

IMPLEMENT RISK BASED PRICING, MODIFY POLICY TERMS OR REDUCE EXPOSURES TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO ADDRESS RISING LOSSES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES AND SMALLER SCALE WEATHER EVENTS (SHOULD THOSE INCREASED

LOSSES OCCUR), ITS BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE "RISK FACTORSCATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR

LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE."



THE FULL RANGE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. THROUGH THE COMPANY'S

EMERGING ISSUES COMMITTEE AND ITS COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY WORKS WITH ITS BUSINESS UNITS AND CORPORATE GROUPS AS APPROPRIATE TO IDENTIFY AND TRY TO ASSESS CLIMATE

CHANGE-RELATED LIABILITY ISSUES, WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AND OFTEN HARD TO FULLY EVALUATE. SEE "RISK FACTORSTHE EFFECTS OF EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE

UNCERTAIN."

CLIMATE

CHANGE REGULATION ALSO COULD INCREASE THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS' COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, INSUREDS FACED WITH CARBON MANAGEMENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE LESS

AVAILABLE CAPITAL FOR INVESTMENT IN LOSS PREVENTION AND SAFETY FEATURES WHICH MAY, OVER TIME, INCREASE LOSS EXPOSURES. ALSO, INCREASED REGULATION MAY RESULT IN REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, WHICH WOULD

DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF INSURABLE ASSETS AND BUSINESSES.

THE

COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS EMERGING ISSUES, SUCH AS CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS, TO CONSIDER POTENTIAL CHANGES TO ITS MODELING AND THE USE OF SUCH MODELING, AS WELL AS TO HELP

DETERMINE THE NEED FOR NEW UNDERWRITING STRATEGIES, COVERAGE MODIFICATIONS OR NEW PRODUCTS.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES CREDIT RISK, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO MANDATORY POOLS FOR WHICH LIABILITY IS MOSTLY JOINT AND SEVERAL, AND IS

GENERALLY SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF THE REINSURANCE CEDED, THE COMPANY REMAINS LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS

REINSURED. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED AFTER REDUCTIONS FOR KNOWN INSOLVENCIES AND AFTER ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS COLLATERAL,

111

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCLUDING

TRUST AGREEMENTS, ESCROW FUNDS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, UNDER CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF REINSURERS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND REVIEWS ITS

REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS PERIODICALLY. REINSURERS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS. AFTER REINSURANCE IS PURCHASED, THE

COMPANY HAS LIMITED ABILITY TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK TO A REINSURER. IN ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO

TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY

AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY.

THE

COMPANY'S REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES TOTALED $11.52 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, A DECLINE OF $1.30 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2009, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

CASH COLLECTIONS AND THE IMPACT OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RESULTING FROM A RECENT FAVORABLE RULING

RELATING TO A REINSURANCE DISPUTE.

THE

COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO MASTER SECURITY AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN REINSURERS. THESE AGREEMENTS DEFINE CONDITIONS THAT REQUIRE THE REINSURER TO PROVIDE COLLATERAL. THE SPECIFIC

CONDITIONS AND THE AMOUNTS AND FORM OF COLLATERAL TO BE PROVIDED BY THESE AGREEMENTS VARY BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE REINSURERS' LEGAL STRUCTURE AND TRADING

HISTORY WITH THE COMPANY.

CERTAIN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE CERTAIN AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS COMPRISE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

SETTLE CERTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE THE COMPANY DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE

STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT IS INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AS THE COMPANY RETAINS THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED

ANNUITY PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, OLD MUTUAL PLC, THE PARENT OF A U.S. LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST

ISSUERS OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, AGREED TO SELL ITS U.S. LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS TO A HEDGE FUND BUYER, PENDING REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE COMPANY

REINSURANCE COMPANIES AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY TURBULENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DURING 2009 AND 2008. A NUMBER OF SUCH COMPANIES WERE SUBJECTED TO

DOWNGRADES AND/OR NEGATIVE OUTLOOK CHANGES BY VARIOUS RATINGS AGENCIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THESE FACTORS IN ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF ITS

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS.

OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES OUTLOOK INFORMATION FOR CERTAIN KEY DRIVERS OF THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL

POSITION.

PREMIUMS.

THE COMPANY'S EARNED PREMIUMS ARE A FUNCTION OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS COMPRISE BOTH RENEWAL

BUSINESS AND NEW

BUSINESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED PREMIUM OVER THE LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING POLICIES. WHEN BUSINESS RENEWS, THE AMOUNT OF NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUSINESS MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE

(RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE) AS A RESULT OF INCREASES OR DECREASES IN RATE AND/OR INSURED EXPOSURES, WHICH THE COMPANY CONSIDERS AS A MEASURE OF UNITS OF EXPOSURE. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FROM BOTH RENEWAL

AND NEW BUSINESS, AND THEREFORE EARNED PREMIUMS, ARE IMPACTED BY COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH, PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF THE BUSINESS INSURANCE

SEGMENT, AFFECT AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, POLICY ENDORSEMENTS AND MID-TERM CANCELLATIONS. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS ARE ALSO IMPACTED BY THE STRUCTURE OF REINSURANCE PROGRAMS AND RELATED

COSTS.

THE

COMPANY EXPECTS RETENTION LEVELS (THE AMOUNT OF EXPIRING PREMIUM THAT RENEWS, BEFORE THE IMPACT OF RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES) WILL REMAIN STRONG, GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH RECENT

PERIODS. IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SLIGHTLY IMPROVING TREND IN RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES, INCLUDING THE COMPONENTS OF RATE CHANGES AND INSURED EXPOSURES, DURING 2011

COMPARED WITH 2010. IN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES, INCLUDING THE COMPONENTS OF RATE CHANGES AND INSURED

EXPOSURES, WILL NOT MEANINGFULLY CHANGE DURING 2011 COMPARED WITH 2010. IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT AGENCY AUTOMOBILE RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES, WHILE POSITIVE, WILL

DECREASE SLIGHTLY IN 2011 FROM LEVELS IN 2010. FOR ITS AGENCY HOMEOWNERS' AND OTHER BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES IN 2011 WILL REMAIN GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH 2010.

THE

PRICING ENVIRONMENT FOR NEW BUSINESS GENERALLY HAS LESS OF AN IMPACT ON UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY THAN RENEWAL RATE CHANGES, GIVEN THE VOLUME OF NEW BUSINESS RELATIVE TO RENEWAL

BUSINESS. WHILE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN 2011 FOR NEW BUSINESS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS WELL-POSITIONED TO CAPITALIZE ON

NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AS AGENTS, BROKERS AND CUSTOMERS SEEK TO PLACE BUSINESS WITH HIGH-QUALITY CARRIERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED A NEW DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL IN 2009 THAT

MARKETS PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE MODEST GROWTH IN PREMIUM VOLUME FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE IN 2011.

113

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE RECENTLY IMPROVED, THERE IS CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING AND STRENGTH OF ANY ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THE TREND MAY NOT CONTINUE. FURTHER, IF

GROWTH CONTINUES, IT MAY BE AT A SLOW RATE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IN ADDITION, OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE ENVIRONMENT AND EMPLOYMENT RATES,

MAY CONTINUE TO BE WEAK. IF WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS PERSIST OR DETERIORATE, LOW LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD IMPACT EXPOSURE CHANGES AT RENEWAL AND OUR ABILITY TO WRITE BUSINESS AT ACCEPTABLE

RATES. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH LOW LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT AUDIT PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS, POLICY ENDORSEMENTS AND MID-TERM CANCELLATIONS AFTER POLICIES ARE WRITTEN. ALL

OF THE FOREGOING, IN TURN, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2011. SINCE EARNED PREMIUMS LAG NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS, EARNED PREMIUMS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN 2011 AND INTO 2012.

UNDERWRITING GAIN/LOSS.

IN BUSINESS INSURANCE, THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

ON THE

COMPANY'S EARNED PREMIUMS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, COUPLED WITH AN EXPECTED MODEST INCREASE IN LOSS COSTS, WILL LIKELY RESULT IN MODESTLY REDUCED UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY DURING 2011, AS COMPARED WITH

2010. IN FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE, THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF A DECLINE IN EARNED PREMIUMS RESULTING FROM LOWER LEVELS OF WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2010, COMBINED WITH HIGHER

EMPLOYEE- AND TECHNOLOGY-RELATED COSTS TO ENHANCE OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT FUTURE BUSINESS GROWTH, WILL LIKELY RESULT IN MODESTLY REDUCED UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY DURING 2011 AS COMPARED WITH 2010. IN

PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF CONTINUED POSITIVE RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGES ON THE COMPANY'S EARNED PREMIUMS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, COMBINED WITH AN EXPECTED MODEST INCREASE IN LOSS COSTS,

WILL LIKELY RESULT IN MODESTLY INCREASED UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY DURING 2011, AS COMPARED WITH 2010. IN PERSONAL INSURANCE, THE COMPANY'S DIRECT TO CONSUMER INITIATIVE, DISCUSSED ABOVE, WHILE

INTENDED TO ENHANCE THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN A CONSUMER-DRIVEN MARKETPLACE, IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNPROFITABLE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AS THIS BOOK OF

BUSINESS GROWS AND MATURES.

IN

RECENT PERIODS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ALL OF THE COMPANY'S SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY IN

ACCIDENT YEARS 2001 THROUGH 2007. BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE AND OTHER FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CONTINUE AT HIGHER, LOWER OR THE SAME LEVELS AS COMPARED TO RECENT PERIODS, MAY NOT

CONTINUE OR MAY REVERSE, CAUSING THE COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE HIGHER, LOWER OR THE SAME LEVELS OF FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, NO FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OR UNFAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, THE ONGOING REVIEW OF PRIOR YEAR CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, OR OTHER CHANGES IN CURRENT PERIOD CIRCUMSTANCES, MAY RESULT IN

THE COMPANY REVISING CURRENT YEAR LOSS ESTIMATES UPWARD OR DOWNWARD IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CATASTROPHE

LOSSES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE FROM YEAR TO YEAR, AND THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2011.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ITS INVESTMENT STRATEGY ON MAINTAINING A HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO

AND A RELATIVELY LOW AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION.

NET

INVESTMENT INCOME IS A MATERIAL CONTRIBUTOR TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WHILE INTEREST RATES HAVE RECENTLY RISEN ABOVE THE HISTORIC LOWS EXPERIENCED IN THE SECOND HALF OF

2010, THE COMPANY EXPECTS INVESTMENT RETURNS FOR ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER IN 2011 THAN IN RECENT PERIODS DUE TO LOWER REINVESTMENT YIELDS AVAILABLE FOR MATURING

LONG-TERM FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT OR NEAR HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS INVESTMENT INCOME IN ITS

NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN 2011 TO BE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH 2010. HOWEVER, IF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND/OR INVESTMENT MARKET CONDITIONS DETERIORATE IN 2011, THE

COMPANY COULD ALSO EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND/OR SIGNIFICANT REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES, INCLUDING IMPAIRMENTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS FIXED INCOME ASSETS, INCLUDING ITS

MUNICIPAL PORTFOLIO, TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS AND SUPPORT ITS INSURANCE OPERATIONS OVER THE LONG-TERM. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S MUNICIPAL

CAPITAL POSITION.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS A STRONG CAPITAL POSITION AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE ITS COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN

2011 AS PART

OF ITS CONTINUING EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER VALUE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OF SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2011 WILL EXCEED ITS OPERATING INCOME FOR THE YEAR, AS IT DID IN 2010, BUT

THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OF SHARE REPURCHASES IS EXPECTED TO BE LOWER THAN IN 2010. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF SHARE REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS,

CORPORATE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, SHARE PRICE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES, STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO REPURCHASE

SHARES IN EXCESS OF ITS OPERATING INCOME IN FUTURE YEARS.

THE

COMPANY HAD A NET AFTER-TAX UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN OF $1.74 BILLION IN ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. WHILE THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO PREDICT FUTURE INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS, A RISING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WOULD REDUCE THE MARKET VALUE OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND, THEREFORE, REDUCE SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY,

AND A DECLINING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WOULD HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECTS.

MANY

OF THE STATEMENTS IN THIS "OUTLOOK" SECTION ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND BEYOND THE COMPANY'S

CONTROL. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FURTHER, SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT

AND THE COMPANY UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THEM. SEE "FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS." FOR A DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION, SEE "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS" AND "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES" IN THIS REPORT.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO MEET THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CASH

REQUIREMENTS OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ASSET MATURITIES AND INCOME RECEIVED ON

INVESTMENTS. CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES, AND IN RECENT YEARS, FOR COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES. THE TIMING

AND AMOUNT OF CATASTROPHE CLAIMS ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. SUCH CLAIMS INCREASE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE RECOVERIES MAY BE AFFECTED BY REINSURER SOLVENCY AND

REINSURANCE COVERAGE DISPUTES. ADDITIONALLY, THE VARIABILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIM PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS THE VOLATILITY OF POTENTIAL JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS ARISING OUT OF LITIGATION, MAY ALSO

RESULT IN INCREASED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT THAT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS WILL BE ADEQUATELY MET FROM ALL OF THE ABOVE SOURCES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, TOTAL CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTED ASSETS AGGREGATING $3.61 BILLION AND HAVING A WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF 58 DAYS WERE HELD AT

THE HOLDING COMPANY. THE ASSETS HELD AT THE HOLDING COMPANY ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE HOLDING COMPANY'S CURRENT LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND ARE MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE COMPANY'S TARGET LEVEL. THESE

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND DEBT SERVICE. THE COMPANY HAS A SHELF REGISTRATION WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WHICH PERMITS IT TO ISSUE SECURITIES

FROM TIME TO TIME. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS A $1.0 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT FACILITY WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT EXPIRES IN 2013. THIS LINE OF CREDIT ALSO SUPPORTS THE COMPANY'S

$800 MILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, OF WHICH $100 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE COMPANY IS NOT RELIANT ON ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM TO MEET ITS OPERATING

CASH FLOW NEEDS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY UTILIZES UNCOLLATERALIZED LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED BY MAJOR BANKS WITH AN AGGREGATE LIMIT OF APPROXIMATELY $537 MILLION TO PROVIDE MUCH OF THE CAPITAL NEEDED

TO SUPPORT ITS OBLIGATIONS AT LLOYD'S. IF UNCOLLATERALIZED LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE PRICE OR AT ALL IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY CAN COLLATERALIZE THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT OR

MAY HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF SUPPORTING ITS OBLIGATIONS AT LLOYD'S, WHICH COULD INCLUDE UTILIZING HOLDING COMPANY FUNDS ON HAND.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $3.05 BILLION, $4.23 BILLION AND $3.14 BILLION IN 2010,

2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. CASH FLOWS IN 2010 REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF LOSS COST TRENDS AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF CATASTROPHE LOSS

PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS A LOWER LEVEL OF REINSURANCE RECOVERIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN THE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION PLAN AND LOWER CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

PAYMENTS RELATED TO OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF AS COMPARED WITH 2009. CASH FLOWS IN 2009 REFLECTED A DECLINE IN CATASTROPHE LOSS PAYMENTS, A HIGHER LEVEL OF REINSURANCE RECOVERIES, A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT

OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION PLAN AND LOWER CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS RELATED TO OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF AS COMPARED WITH 2008. THOSE RUNOFF PAYMENTS IN 2008 INCLUDED THE

COMPANY'S ONE-TIME NET PAYMENT OF $365 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE FINAL SETTLEMENT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS RELATED TO ACANDS, INC. IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010,

2009 AND 2008, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $35 MILLION, $260 MILLION AND $450 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO ITS PENSION PLAN.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $2.11 BILLION IN 2010, COMPARED WITH NET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING

ACTIVITIES OF $899 MILLION AND $162 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 DECREASED BY $2.24 BILLION

FROM YEAR-END 2009, DRIVEN BY THE NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. THE PROCEEDS FROM THOSE SALES AND MATURITIES, ALONG WITH OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF

$3.05 BILLION IN 2010, WERE THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THE COMPANY'S $5.04 BILLION OF COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2010. NET PRETAX UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM THE SAME DATE IN 2009. THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 INCREASED BY $4.23 BILLION FROM

YEAR-END 2008, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A $3.08 BILLION PRETAX INCREASE IN THE UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS SINCE YEAR-END 2008 AND INVESTMENT PURCHASES RESULTING

FROM STRONG CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3.29 BILLION OF COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES MADE DURING 2009. THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMPANY'S NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN POSITION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 OVER THE PRIOR YEAR IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. THE IMPROVED VALUATIONS ON THESE HOLDINGS REFLECT THE CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS

IN 2009 WHICH INCLUDED A SIGNIFICANT NARROWING OF CREDIT SPREADS.

IN

THE FIRST HALF OF 2011, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO FUND ITS INVESTMENT IN J. MALUCELLI WITH CASH FROM INTERNAL SOURCES. SEE

"PART IITEM 1FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE" IN THIS REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THIS INVESTMENT.

THE

PRIMARY GOALS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETLIABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS ARE TO SATISFY THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER FLUCTUATIONS IN

PROJECTED LIABILITY CASH FLOWS. GENERALLY, THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO ADEQUATELY FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANY'S

INSURANCE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EXACT CASH FLOW MATCH IN EACH PERIOD, THE SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE BY WHICH THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE OF

THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUND CLAIM PAYMENTS

WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES.

PRIOR

TO NOVEMBER 2010, THE COMPANY WAS SUBJECT TO A REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT THAT IT HAD GRANTED TO THE HOLDERS OF ITS 6.75% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 20, 2036 (THE SENIOR

LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT.

ON JUNE 10, 2010, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT

WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, REPLACING ITS FIVE-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT EXPIRED ON THAT DATE. PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT COVENANTS, THE COMPANY

MUST MAINTAIN A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH (GENERALLY DEFINED AS SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY PLUS CERTAIN TRUST PREFERRED AND MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES, REDUCED FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS) OF $14.35 BILLION. THE COMPANY MUST ALSO MAINTAIN A RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO THE SUM OF TOTAL DEBT PLUS CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OF NOT GREATER THAN 0.40 TO 1.00. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT

AGREEMENT CONTAINS OTHER CUSTOMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO A CHANGE IN CONTROL, WHICH IS DEFINED TO INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF

35% OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S VOTING STOCK AND CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS.

GENERALLY, THE COST OF BORROWING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL RANGE FROM LIBOR PLUS 100 BASIS POINTS TO LIBOR PLUS 175 BASIS POINTS DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010,

THAT COST WOULD HAVE BEEN LIBOR PLUS 125 BASIS POINTS HAD THERE BEEN ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THIS LINE OF CREDIT ALSO SUPPORTS THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.

SHELF REGISTRATION.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE POTENTIAL OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES. THE COMPANY MAY OFFER THESE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT

THE TIME OF OFFERING. DURING 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY ISSUED SECURITIES WITH A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1.25 BILLION AND $500 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD $1.51 BILLION OF CAPACITY REMAINING UNDER ITS SHARE

REPURCHASE

AUTHORIZATION APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IN JANUARY 2011, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION THAT ADDED AN ADDITIONAL $5 BILLION OF REPURCHASE CAPACITY TO

THE $1.51 BILLION OF CAPACITY THAT REMAINED AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND

ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM-RELATED PAYMENTS. THE TABLE EXCLUDES SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS AND INCLUDES ONLY LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED IN CASH.

THE

TABLE BELOW INCLUDES THE AMOUNT AND ESTIMATED FUTURE TIMING OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED PAYMENTS. THE AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE EXACT LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT ESTIMATES,

GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST BASED ON

THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY, FREQUENCY, LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER

FACTORS. VARIABLES IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION OR DEFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS

AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. MANY OF THESE ITEMS ARE NOT DIRECTLY QUANTIFIABLE, PARTICULARLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE

POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND THE TIME IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER. THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE TABLE BELOW REQUIRED ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT (INCLUDING SEVERITY

CONSIDERATIONS) AND TIMING. AMOUNT AND TIMING ARE FREQUENTLY ESTIMATED SEPARATELY. AN ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED PAYMENTS IS

GENERALLY RELIABLE ONLY IN THE AGGREGATE WITH SOME UNAVOIDABLE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING, A REINSURANCE AGREEMENT MUST INDEMNIFY THE INSURER FROM INSURANCE RISK, I.E., THE AGREEMENT MUST TRANSFER AMOUNT AND TIMING RISK. SINCE THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH INFLOWS FROM SUCH REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES BY THE INSURER, REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE LIABILITIES (THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES) RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING REINSURED CONTRACTS. THE PRESENCE OF ANY FEATURE

THAT CAN DELAY TIMELY REIMBURSEMENT OF CLAIMS BY A REINSURER RESULTS IN THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DEPOSIT RATHER THAN REINSURANCE (SEE BELOW). THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN

ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE USED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE RELATED LIABILITIES.

DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT. THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF

CONNECTICUT APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRES NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND THAT, TOGETHER WITH OTHER

DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURER'S CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURER'S NET INCOME FOR THE

TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND BY STATE REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER

LIMITED BY ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.

THE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE RESTRICTIVE,

LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. A MAXIMUM OF $3.61 BILLION IS AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2011 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. THE

COMPANY MAY CHOOSE TO ACCELERATE THE TIMING WITHIN 2011 AND/OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2011, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CERTAIN DIVIDENDS BEING SUBJECT TO

APPROVAL BY THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. THE HOLDING COMPANY RECEIVED $6.59 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2010, INCLUDING $5.26 BILLION OF

DIVIDENDS THAT WERE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPANY'S REQUEST FOR THE ACCELERATED TIMING OF PAYMENT.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE TO USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, ALL OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD

ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS REQUIRING ANY COMPANY OR REGULATORY ACTION.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO CERTAIN CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS FOR GUARANTEES RELATED TO LETTERS OF CREDIT, ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES,

CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, THIRD-PARTY LOANS RELATED TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND VARIOUS INDEMNIFICATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO THE SALE OF BUSINESS ENTITIES. SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL POSITION, REVENUES AND

EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES TO BE THOSE APPLIED TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND

RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, INVESTMENT VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENTS, AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS.

124

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD

REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE

SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT

PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING LOSS RESERVES, THE COMPANY ALSO TAKES INTO

ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION. THE LOSS RESERVES ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS,

SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, CHANGES IN INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF

MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO

DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE

OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND

EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS

ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. THE COMPANY RIGOROUSLY ATTEMPTS TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME LOSS RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY

UNDERLYING LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT ENVIRONMENT, FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY BE HIGHER

OR LOWER THAN THE RELATED LOSS RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES, AS CLAIMS ARE SETTLED IN THE FUTURE, MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT IN AMOUNT THAN CURRENT LOSS

RESERVESFAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE.

BECAUSE

ESTABLISHMENT OF LOSS RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES, CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED LOSS RESERVES MAY CHANGE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO LOSS

RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED.

THERE

ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC

EVENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY

UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND;

EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE, INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION, FRAUD, THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND

BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY IN

ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

A

PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S GROSS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (TOTALING $3.30 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010) ARE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

RELATED LITIGATION. WHILE THE ONGOING REVIEW OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED

IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT

LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION."

ASBESTOS

AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER LINES IN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY TABLE. ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE DISCUSSED SEPARATELY; SEE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION", "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES."

GENERAL DISCUSSION

THE PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING THE LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES BEGINS WITH THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CLAIM

DATA. DATA ON INDIVIDUAL REPORTED CLAIMS, BOTH CURRENT AND HISTORICAL, INCLUDING PAID AMOUNTS AND INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES, ARE GROUPED BY COMMON CHARACTERISTICS (COMPONENTS) AND EVALUATED

BY ACTUARIES IN THEIR ANALYSES OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES BY PRODUCT LINE. SUCH DATA IS OCCASIONALLY SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA AS AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING

RESERVES FOR A COMPONENT IS UNDERTAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS, GENERALLY QUARTERLY, IN LIGHT OF CONTINUALLY UPDATED INFORMATION.

MULTIPLE

ESTIMATION METHODS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES. EACH ESTIMATION METHOD HAS ITS OWN SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES AND ITS OWN ADVANTAGES AND

DISADVANTAGES, WITH NO SINGLE ESTIMATION METHOD BEING BETTER THAN THE OTHERS IN ALL SITUATIONS AND NO ONE SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES BEING MEANINGFUL FOR ALL PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS. THE RELATIVE

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE PARTICULAR ESTIMATION METHODS WHEN APPLIED TO A PARTICULAR GROUP OF CLAIMS CAN ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME. THEREFORE, THE ACTUAL CHOICE OF ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CAN CHANGE

WITH EACH EVALUATION. THE ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CHOSEN ARE THOSE THAT ARE BELIEVED TO PRODUCE THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATION AT THAT PARTICULAR EVALUATION DATE FOR THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED.

126

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN MOST CASES, MULTIPLE ESTIMATION METHODS WILL BE VALID FOR THE PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED. THIS WILL RESULT IN

A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES FOR ANY PARTICULAR CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY USES SUCH RANGE ANALYSES TO BACK TEST WHETHER PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES FOR RESERVES AT THE REPORTING SEGMENTS

ARE REASONABLE, GIVEN SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION. REPORTED VALUES FOUND TO BE CLOSER TO THE ENDPOINTS OF A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER DETAILED REVIEWS. THESE REVIEWS MAY

SUBSTANTIATE THE VALIDITY OF MANAGEMENT'S RECORDED ESTIMATE OR LEAD TO A CHANGE IN THE REPORTED ESTIMATE.

THE

EXACT BOUNDARY POINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN QUANTITATIVE IN NATURE, AS NO CLEAR LINE OF DEMARCATION EXISTS TO DETERMINE WHEN THE SET OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR

AN ESTIMATION METHOD SWITCHES FROM BEING REASONABLE TO UNREASONABLE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ENDPOINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE OR WOULD BE COMPARABLE ACROSS COMPANIES. IN

ADDITION, POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT ESTIMATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES MAKE THE AGGREGATION OF INDIVIDUAL RANGES A HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL AND INEXACT PROCESS.

PROPERTY-CASUALTY

INSURANCE POLICIES ARE EITHER WRITTEN ON A CLAIMS-MADE OR ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. CLAIMS-MADE POLICIES GENERALLY COVER, SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS

IN INDIVIDUAL POLICIES, CLAIMS REPORTED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD. POLICIES THAT ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS REQUIRE THAT THE INSURED DEMONSTRATE THAT A LOSS OCCURRED IN THE POLICY PERIOD, EVEN

IF THE INSURED REPORTS THE LOSS MANY YEARS LATER.

MOST

GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. THESE POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT OVER TIME AS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE IN THE YEARS

FOLLOWING THE POLICY ISSUANCE. THE OCCURRENCE FORM, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, IS ALSO USED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION

GENERAL LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. OCCURRENCE-BASED FORMS OF INSURANCE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PROJECTION OF VARIOUS TRENDS, INCLUDING FUTURE INFLATION AND

JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND SOCIETAL LITIGATION DYNAMICS, AMONG OTHERS.

A

BASIC PREMISE IN MOST ACTUARIAL ANALYSES IS THAT PAST PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED IN THE DATA WILL REPEAT THEMSELVES IN THE FUTURE, ABSENT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS

DISCUSSED BELOW. TO THE EXTENT A MATERIAL CHANGE AFFECTING THE ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY IS KNOWN, SUCH CHANGE IS QUANTIFIED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL COMPANY DATA AND, IF

AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXTERNAL DATA. SUCH A MEASUREMENT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR CLAIM PORTFOLIO AND THE KNOWN CHANGE BEING EVALUATED. SIGNIFICANT

STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS.

INFORMED

JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE RESERVING PROCESS. THIS INCLUDES THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. IN

ADDITION TO ACTUARIES, EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE RESERVING PROCESS ALSO INCLUDE UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO

CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES. IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE, SUCH AS A MERGER, CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF INFORMED

JUDGMENT BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT.

THE

VARIABLES DISCUSSED ABOVE IN THIS GENERAL DISCUSSION HAVE DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON RESERVE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE CLAIM TAIL, THE

REPORTING LAG, THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CLAIM PROCESS FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE.

PRODUCT

LINES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIABLE AS EITHER LONG TAIL OR SHORT TAIL, BASED ON THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING CLAIMS UNDER A POLICY AND THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THOSE CLAIMS. SHORT TAIL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED QUICKLY, RESULTING IN LESS ESTIMATION VARIABILITY. THE LONGER THE TIME BEFORE FINAL CLAIM RESOLUTION, THE GREATER THE EXPOSURE TO

ESTIMATION RISKS AND HENCE THE GREATER THE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

127

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A

MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE CLAIM TAIL IS THE REPORTING LAG. THE REPORTING LAG, WHICH IS THE TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING A CLAIM AND THE REPORTING OF THE CLAIM TO THE INSURER, MAKES

ESTIMATING IBNR

INHERENTLY MORE UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, THE GREATER THE REPORTING LAG, THE GREATER THE PROPORTION OF IBNR TO THE TOTAL CLAIM LIABILITY FOR THE PRODUCT LINE. WRITING NEW PRODUCTS WITH MATERIAL

REPORTING LAGS CAN RESULT IN ADDING SEVERAL YEARS WORTH OF IBNR CLAIM EXPOSURE BEFORE THE REPORTING LAG EXPOSURE BECOMES CLEARLY OBSERVABLE, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PRICING AND

RESERVING SUCH PRODUCTS. THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF CLAIM LIABILITIES WITH LONG REPORTING LAGS ARE ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

FOR

SOME LINES, THE IMPACT OF LARGE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS CAN BE MATERIAL TO THE ANALYSIS. THESE LINES ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS BEING "LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY," WHILE LINES WITHOUT

THIS "LARGE CLAIM" SENSITIVITY ARE REFERRED TO AS "HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY." ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY LINES CAN BE SENSITIVE TO THE IMPACT OF A SMALL NUMBER

OF POTENTIALLY LARGE CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE ROLE OF JUDGMENT IS MUCH GREATER FOR THESE RESERVE ESTIMATES. IN CONTRAST, FOR HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY LINES THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS IS

RELATIVELY MINOR AND THE RANGE OF REASONABLE RESERVE ESTIMATES IS NARROWER AND MORE STABLE.

CLAIM

COMPLEXITY CAN ALSO GREATLY AFFECT THE ESTIMATION PROCESS BY IMPACTING THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ESTIMATE, THE POTENTIAL STABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING DATA AND

CLAIM PROCESS, AND THE ABILITY TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA. PRODUCT LINES WITH GREATER CLAIM COMPLEXITY, SUCH AS FOR CERTAIN SURETY AND CONSTRUCTION EXPOSURES, HAVE INHERENTLY GREATER

ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

ACTUARIES

HAVE TO EXERCISE A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT IN THE EVALUATION OF ALL THESE FACTORS IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF RESERVES. THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN THE APPLICATION OF ACTUARIAL

JUDGMENT IS UNAVOIDABLE WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY. DIFFERENT ACTUARIES MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH SUCH UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL

EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF FOCUS. HENCE, THE ESTIMATES SELECTED BY THE VARIOUS ACTUARIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EACH OTHER.

LASTLY,

SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN ALSO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS. EVENTS SUCH AS MERGERS INCREASE THE

INHERENT UNCERTAINTY OF RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, UNTIL STABLE TRENDS RE-ESTABLISH THEMSELVES WITHIN THE NEW ORGANIZATION.

RISK FACTORS

THE MAJOR CAUSES OF MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY ("RISK FACTORS") GENERALLY WILL VARY FOR EACH PRODUCT LINE, AS WELL AS FOR EACH SEPARATELY

ANALYZED COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT LINE. IN A FEW CASES, SUCH RISK FACTORS ARE EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ESTIMATION METHOD, BUT IN MOST CASES, THEY ARE IMPLICIT. FOR EXAMPLE, A METHOD MAY EXPLICITLY

ASSUME THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS WILL CLOSE EACH YEAR, BUT WILL IMPLICITLY ASSUME THAT THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING CONTRACT LANGUAGE WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED. ACTUAL RESULTS WILL

LIKELY VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS, CAUSING ACTUAL PAID LOSSES, AS CLAIMS ARE SETTLED IN THE FUTURE, TO BE DIFFERENT IN AMOUNT THAN THE RESERVES BEING ESTIMATED CURRENTLY.

SOME

RISK FACTORS WILL AFFECT MORE THAN ONE PRODUCT LINE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CHANGES IN CLAIM DEPARTMENT PRACTICES, CHANGES IN SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS,

COURT ACTIONS, TIMELINESS OF CLAIM REPORTING, STATE MIX OF CLAIMANTS AND DEGREE OF CLAIMANT FRAUD. THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF A RISK FACTOR WILL ALSO VARY BY COMPONENTS WITHIN A PRODUCT LINE.

INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER RISK FACTORS WITHIN PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS.

THE

EFFECT OF A PARTICULAR RISK FACTOR ON ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES CANNOT BE ISOLATED IN MOST CASES. FOR EXAMPLE, ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL CLAIM SETTLEMENTS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL COURT RULINGS, BUT THE FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TYPICALLY DOES NOT DELINEATE HOW MUCH OF THE SETTLED AMOUNT IS DUE TO THIS AND OTHER FACTORS.

EVALUATION OF DATA IS ALSO SUBJECT TO DISTORTION FROM EXTREME EVENTS OR STRUCTURAL SHIFTS, SOMETIMES IN UNANTICIPATED WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TIMING OF CLAIMS PAYMENTS IN ONE

GEOGRAPHIC REGION WILL BE IMPACTED IF CLAIM ADJUSTERS ARE TEMPORARILY REASSIGNED FROM THAT REGION TO HELP SETTLE CATASTROPHE CLAIMS IN ANOTHER REGION.

WHILE

SOME CHANGES IN THE CLAIM ENVIRONMENT ARE SUDDEN IN NATURE (SUCH AS A NEW COURT RULING AFFECTING THE INTERPRETATION OF ALL CONTRACTS IN THAT JURISDICTION), OTHERS ARE MORE

EVOLUTIONARY. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES CAN OCCUR WHEN MULTIPLE FACTORS AFFECT FINAL CLAIM VALUES, WITH THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING EACH FACTOR BEING RESOLVED SEPARATELY, IN STEPWISE FASHION. THE FINAL

IMPACT IS NOT KNOWN UNTIL ALL STEPS HAVE OCCURRED.

SUDDEN

CHANGES GENERALLY CAUSE A ONE-TIME SHIFT IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME LAG IN RELIABLE QUANTIFICATION OF THEIR IMPACT. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES

GENERALLY CAUSE A SERIES OF SHIFTS IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, AS EACH COMPONENT OF THE EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE BECOMES EVIDENT AND ESTIMABLE.

ACTUARIAL METHODS FOR ANALYZING AND ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

THE PRINCIPAL ESTIMATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES ARE THE PAID DEVELOPMENT METHOD, THE CASE INCURRED

DEVELOPMENT METHOD, THE BORNHUETTER-FERGUSON (BF) METHOD, AND AVERAGE VALUE ANALYSIS COMBINED WITH THE REPORTED CLAIM DEVELOPMENT METHOD. THE BF METHOD IS USUALLY UTILIZED FOR MORE RECENT ACCIDENT

PERIODS, WITH A TRANSITION TO OTHER METHODS AS THE UNDERLYING CLAIM DATA BECOMES MORE VOLUMINOUS AND THEREFORE MORE CREDIBLE. THESE ARE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS. (SEE

GLOSSARY FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THESE METHODS).

WHILE

THESE ARE THE PRINCIPAL METHODS UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY, ACTUARIES EVALUATING A PARTICULAR COMPONENT FOR A PRODUCT LINE HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM THE FULL RANGE OF METHODS

DEVELOPED WITHIN THE CASUALTY ACTUARIAL PROFESSION. THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES ARE ALSO CONTINUALLY MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE PROFESSION FOR ADVANCES IN EXISTING TECHNIQUES OR THE CREATION OF

NEW TECHNIQUES THAT MIGHT IMPROVE CURRENT AND FUTURE ESTIMATES.

SOME

COMPONENTS OF PRODUCT LINE RESERVES ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RELATIVELY INFREQUENT LARGE CLAIMS THAT CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TOTAL ESTIMATE FOR THAT COMPONENT. IN SUCH CASES, THE

COMPANY'S ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS GENERALLY ISOLATES AND ANALYZES SEPARATELY SUCH LARGE CLAIMS. THE RESERVES EXCLUDING SUCH LARGE CLAIMS ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED USING THE TRADITIONAL METHODS DESCRIBED

ABOVE. THE RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE CLAIMS ARE THEN ANALYZED UTILIZING VARIOUS METHODS, SUCH AS.



ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF LARGE CLAIMS AND THEIR AVERAGE VALUES BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS FROM PRIOR ACCIDENT PERIODS,

ADJUSTED FOR THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH ACTUAL DATA FOR THE ACCIDENT YEAR ANALYZED TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE.



UTILIZING INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES OF THE LARGE CLAIMS, COMBINED WITH CONTINUAL MONITORING OF THE AGGREGATE

ACCURACY OF SUCH CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES. (THIS MONITORING MAY LEAD TO SUPPLEMENTAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AGGREGATE OF SUCH CLAIM ESTIMATES.)



UTILIZING HISTORIC LONGER-TERM AVERAGE RATIOS OF LARGE CLAIMS TO SMALL CLAIMS, AND APPLYING SUCH RATIOS TO THE

ESTIMATED ULTIMATE SMALL CLAIMS FROM TRADITIONAL ANALYSIS.



GROUND-UP ANALYSIS OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE (TYPICALLY USED FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL).

THE

RESULTS OF SUCH METHODOLOGIES ARE SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS REASONABILITY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, INCLUDING PAID-TO-INCURRED LOSS RATIOS, IMPLIED

INCURRED-LOSS-TO-EARNED-PREMIUM RATIOS AND NON-ZERO CLAIM SEVERITY TRENDS. AN ACTUAL VERSUS EXPECTED ANALYSIS IS ALSO PERFORMED COMPARING ACTUAL LOSS

DEVELOPMENT TO EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT BASED ON THE PRIOR REVIEW. ADDITIONAL ANALYSES MAY BE PERFORMED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE DIAGNOSTICS, INCLUDING THE INVESTIGATION OF OTHER ACTUARIAL METHODS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT'S EXISTING ESTIMATE FOR PRIOR ACCIDENT PERIODS. FOR THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR, THE

AVAILABLE CLAIM DATA IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE A RELIABLE INDICATION. HENCE, THE INITIAL ESTIMATE FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR IS GENERALLY BASED ON A LOSS RATIO PROJECTION METHOD, WHICH USES THE

EARNED PREMIUM FOR THE CURRENT YEAR MULTIPLIED BY A PROJECTED LOSS RATIO. THE PROJECTED LOSS RATIO IS DETERMINED THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF PRIOR PERIODS' EXPERIENCE, USING LOSS TREND, RATE LEVEL

DIFFERENCES, MIX OF BUSINESS CHANGES AND OTHER KNOWN OR OBSERVED FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR RELATIVE TO PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS. THE EXACT NUMBER OF PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS UTILIZED

VARIES BY PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT, BASED ON THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS FOR THAT COMPONENT AND THE RELIABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT YEAR ESTIMATE.

MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES

AT LEAST ONCE PER QUARTER, CERTAIN COMPANY MANAGEMENT MEETS WITH ITS ACTUARIES TO REVIEW THE LATEST CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVE ANALYSES. BASED ON THESE ANALYSES, MANAGEMENT DETERMINES WHETHER ITS ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CHANGED. IN DOING SO, IT MUST EVALUATE WHETHER THE NEW DATA PROVIDED

REPRESENTS CREDIBLE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION OR AN ANOMALY THAT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, PAYMENTS MAY HAVE DECREASED IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC

REGION DUE TO FEWER CLAIM ADJUSTERS BEING AVAILABLE TO PROCESS CLAIMS. THE RESULTING CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS WOULD BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CHANGE IN PAYMENT PATTERN REPRESENTS A

CHANGE IN ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY.

SUCH

AN ASSESSMENT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT. IT IS FREQUENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CHANGE IN THE DATA IS AN ANOMALY UNTIL SOMETIME AFTER THE EVENT. EVEN IF A CHANGE

IS DETERMINED TO BE PERMANENT, IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE UNTIL SOMETIME LATER. THE OVERALL DETAILED ANALYSES SUPPORTING SUCH AN EFFORT CAN TAKE SEVERAL

MONTHS TO PERFORM. THIS IS BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE TRENDS OBSERVED NEED TO BE EVALUATED, WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE GATHERING OR ASSEMBLING OF DATA NOT PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. IT MAY ALSO

INCLUDE INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES. AS A RESULT, THERE CAN BE A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE EMERGENCE OF A CHANGE AND A DETERMINATION THAT THE CHANGE SHOULD BE REFLECTED

IN THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED CLAIM LIABILITIES. THE FINAL ESTIMATE SELECTED BY MANAGEMENT IN A REPORTING PERIOD IS BASED ON THESE VARIOUS DETAILED ANALYSES OF PAST DATA, ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ANY NEW

ACTIONABLE INFORMATION.

THE

AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF RESERVING PROPRIETY, AND ANNUALLY REVIEWS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES RESERVES.

DISCUSSION OF PRODUCT LINES

THE FOLLOWING SECTION DETAILS RESERVING CONSIDERATIONS AND COMMON RISK FACTORS BY PRODUCT LINE. THERE ARE MANY ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS

THAT MAY IMPACT ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS. EACH RISK FACTOR PRESENTED WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT ON REQUIRED RESERVES. ALSO, RISK FACTORS CAN HAVE OFFSETTING OR COMPOUNDING EFFECTS ON REQUIRED RESERVES.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN WORKERS' COMPENSATION, THE USE OF EXPENSIVE MEDICAL PROCEDURES THAT RESULT IN MEDICAL COST INFLATION MAY ENABLE WORKERS TO RETURN TO WORK FASTER, THEREBY LOWERING INDEMNITY COSTS.

THUS, IN ALMOST ALL CASES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCRETELY MEASURE THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE RISK FACTOR AND CONSTRUCT A MEANINGFUL SENSITIVITY EXPECTATION.

IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON REASONABLY POSSIBLE RESERVING CHANGES BY PRODUCT LINE, THE HISTORICAL CHANGES IN YEAR-END LOSS RESERVES OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD

ARE PROVIDED FOR THE U.S. PRODUCT LINES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR BOTH THE COMPANY AND THE INDUSTRY FOR THE NINE MOST RECENT YEARS, AND IS BASED ON THE MOST RECENT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FOR

THE REPORTED LINE(S) THAT MOST CLOSELY MATCH THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT LINE BEING DISCUSSED. THESE CHANGES WERE CALCULATED, NET OF REINSURANCE, FROM STATUTORY ANNUAL STATEMENT DATA FOUND IN

SCHEDULE P OF THOSE STATEMENTS, AND REPRESENT THE REPORTED RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON THE BEGINNING-OF-THE-YEAR CLAIM LIABILITIES DIVIDED BY THE BEGINNING CLAIM

LIABILITIES, ALL ACCIDENT YEARS COMBINED, EXCLUDING NON-DEFENSE RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DATA

PRESENTED FOR THE COMPANY INCLUDES HISTORY FOR THE ENTIRE TRAVELERS GROUP (U.S. COMPANIES ONLY), WHETHER OR NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIARIES WERE ORIGINALLY PART OF SPC OR TPC. THIS TREATMENT IS

REQUIRED BY THE STATUTORY REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS PROMULGATED BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES FOR SCHEDULE P. COMPARABLE DATA FOR NON-U.S. COMPANIES IS NOT AVAILABLE.

GENERAL LIABILITY

GENERAL LIABILITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL LINE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS

FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION AND SPECIFIC POLICY PROVISIONS SUCH AS

SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPONENTS UNDERLYING THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. SOME OF THESE HAVE RELATIVELY MODERATE PAYMENT PATTERNS (WITH MOST OF THE CLAIMS FOR A

GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR CLOSED WITHIN 5 TO 7 YEARS), WHILE OTHERS CAN HAVE EXTREME LAGS IN BOTH REPORTING AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS (E.G., A REPORTING LAG OF A DECADE OR MORE FOR "CONSTRUCTION

DEFECT" CLAIMS).

WHILE

THE MAJORITY OF GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES ARE WRITTEN ON AN "OCCURRENCE" BASIS, CERTAIN GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES (SUCH AS THOSE COVERING DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OR PROFESSIONAL

LIABILITY) ARE TYPICALLY INSURED ON A "CLAIMS-MADE" BASIS.

GENERAL

LIABILITY RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED AS TWO COMPONENTS: PRIMARY AND EXCESS/UMBRELLA, WITH THE PRIMARY COMPONENT GENERALLY ANALYZED SEPARATELY FOR BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY

DAMAGE. BODILY INJURY LIABILITY PAYMENTS REIMBURSE THE CLAIMANT FOR DAMAGES PERTAINING TO PHYSICAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S LEGAL OBLIGATION ARISING FROM NON-INTENTIONAL

ACTS SUCH AS NEGLIGENCE, SUBJECT TO THE INSURANCE POLICY PROVISIONS. IN SOME CASES THE DAMAGES CAN INCLUDE FUTURE WAGE LOSS (WHICH IS A FUNCTION OF FUTURE EARNINGS POWER AND WAGE INFLATION) AND FUTURE

MEDICAL TREATMENT COSTS. PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY PAYMENTS RESULT FROM DAMAGES TO THE CLAIMANT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY ARISING FROM THE POLICYHOLDER'S LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR NON-INTENTIONAL

ACTS. IN MOST CASES, PROPERTY DAMAGE LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF COSTS AS OF THE LOSS DATE, OR SOON THEREAFTER. IN ADDITION, SIZABLE OR UNIQUE EXPOSURES ARE REVIEWED SEPARATELY. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE

ASBESTOS, ENVIRONMENTAL, OTHER MASS TORTS, CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND LARGE UNIQUE ACCOUNTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DISTORT THE ANALYSIS. THESE UNIQUE CATEGORIES OFTEN REQUIRE A VERY

HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND REQUIRE RESERVE ANALYSES THAT DO NOT RELY ON TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS.

DEFENSE

COSTS ARE ALSO A PART OF THE INSURED COSTS COVERED BY LIABILITY POLICIES AND CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, SOMETIMES GREATER THAN THE COST OF THE ACTUAL PAID CLAIMS. FOR SOME PRODUCTS THIS

RISK IS MITIGATED BY POLICY LANGUAGE SUCH THAT THE INSURED PORTION OF DEFENSE COSTS ERODES THE AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT AVAILABLE TO PAY THE CLAIM. SUCH "DEFENSE WITHIN THE LIMITS" POLICIES ARE MOST

COMMON FOR "CLAIMS-MADE" PRODUCTS. WHEN DEFENSE COSTS ARE OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITS, AMOUNTS PAID FOR DEFENSE COSTS DO NOT ERODE THE POLICY LIMITS.

THIS

LINE IS TYPICALLY THE LARGEST SOURCE OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY IN THE UNITED STATES (EXCLUDING ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS COVERING THE SAME RISK). MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO

THIS RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY INCLUDE THE REPORTING LAG (I.E., THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING COVERAGE AND THE ACTUAL REPORTING OF THE CLAIM), THE NUMBER OF PARTIES

INVOLVED IN THE UNDERLYING TORT ACTION, WHETHER THE "EVENT" TRIGGERING COVERAGE IS CONFINED TO ONLY ONE TIME PERIOD OR IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE TIME PERIODS, THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED (IN THE

INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ACTIONS), WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND INTENDED TO BE COVERED AT THE TIME THE CONTRACTS WERE WRITTEN (I.E., COVERAGE DISPUTE POTENTIAL), AND THE

POTENTIAL FOR MASS CLAIM ACTIONS. CLAIMS WITH LONGER REPORTING LAGS RESULT IN GREATER INHERENT RISK. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR ALLEGED CLAIMS WITH A LATENCY FEATURE, PARTICULARLY WHERE COURTS HAVE

RULED THAT COVERAGE IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE POLICY YEARS, HENCE INVOLVING MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS (AND THEIR INSURERS AND REINSURERS) AND MULTIPLE POLICIES (THEREBY INCREASING THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS

INVOLVED AND THE UNDERLYING SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY). CLAIMS WITH LONG LATENCIES ALSO

131

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCREASE

THE POTENTIAL RECOGNITION LAG (I.E., THE LAG BETWEEN WRITING A TYPE OF POLICY IN A CERTAIN MARKET AND THE RECOGNITION THAT SUCH POLICIES HAVE POTENTIAL MASS TORT AND/OR LATENT CLAIM

EXPOSURE).

THE

AMOUNT OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY ALSO VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY BY COMPONENT FOR THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. THE COMPONENTS IN THIS PRODUCT LINE WITH THE LONGEST LATENCY,

LONGEST REPORTING LAGS, LARGEST POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED AND GREATEST CLAIM SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY ARE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL. COMPONENTS THAT INCLUDE LATENCY, REPORTING LAG AND/OR COMPLEXITY

ISSUES, BUT TO A MATERIALLY LESSER EXTENT THAN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND OTHER MASS TORT ACTIONS. MANY COMPONENTS OF GENERAL LIABILITY ARE NOT

SUBJECT TO MATERIAL LATENCY OR CLAIM COMPLEXITY RISKS AND HENCE HAVE MATERIALLY LESS UNCERTAINTY THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED COMPONENTS. IN GENERAL, POLICIES PROVIDING COVERAGE WITH SHORTER

REPORTING LAGS, FEWER PARTIES INVOLVED IN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS, ONLY ONE POLICY POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED PER CLAIM, FEWER POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOLLARS, REASONABLY FORESEEABLE (AND STABLE) POTENTIAL

HAZARDS/CLAIMS AND NO MASS TORT POTENTIAL RESULT IN MUCH LESS RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY THAN POLICIES WITHOUT THOSE CHARACTERISTICS.

IN

ADDITION TO THE TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS MENTIONED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION, THE COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS REPORT YEAR DEVELOPMENT AND S-CURVE METHODS FOR THE

CONSTRUCTION DEFECT COMPONENTS OF THIS PRODUCT LINE. THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT REPORT YEAR DEVELOPMENT ANALYSIS IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH PROJECTED CLAIM COUNTS AND AVERAGE VALUES FOR IBNR CLAIM COUNTS. FOR

COMPONENTS WITH GREATER LAGS IN CLAIM REPORTING, SUCH AS EXCESS AND UMBRELLA COMPONENTS OF THIS PRODUCT LINE, THE COMPANY RELIES MORE HEAVILY ON THE BF METHOD THAN ON THE PAID AND CASE INCURRED

DEVELOPMENT METHODS.

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR GENERAL LIABILITY

(EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL), A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.5% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AMOUNTS, OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED

FROM -5% TO 14% (AVERAGING 2%) FOR THE COMPANY AND FROM -5% TO 7% (AVERAGING 1%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN

BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. BECAUSE THE

132

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HIGH

END OF THE COMPANY'S RANGE OF HISTORICAL ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT COMES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESSES THAT THE COMPANY HAS SINCE EXITED, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE INDUSTRY'S RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES

IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. GENERAL LIABILITY RESERVES (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL) REPRESENT

APPROXIMATELY 26% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AMOUNTS, WAS -5% FOR 2010, -5% FOR 2009 AND

-5% FOR 2008. THE 2010 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN EXCESS COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2006 AND PRIOR AND REFLECTED WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL

ENVIRONMENTS. THE 2009 AND 2008 CHANGES WERE DRIVEN BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS

INITIATIVES.

PROPERTY

PROPERTY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL LINE WITH A SIMPLER AND FASTER CLAIM REPORTING AND ADJUSTMENT PROCESS THAN LIABILITY

COVERAGES, AND LESS UNCERTAINTY IN THE RESERVE SETTING PROCESS (EXCEPT FOR MORE COMPLEX BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS). IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A MODERATE FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY LINE,

EXCEPT FOR CATASTROPHES AND COVERAGE RELATED TO LARGE PROPERTIES. THE CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE CLAIM RESERVES IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE

INSURER. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A LOW ESTIMATION RISK, EXCEPT POSSIBLY FOR CATASTROPHES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS.

PROPERTY

RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN TWO COMPONENTS, ONE FOR CATASTROPHIC OR OTHER LARGE SINGLE EVENTS, AND ANOTHER FOR ALL OTHER EVENTS. EXAMPLES OF COMMON RISK FACTORS, OR

PERCEPTIONS THEREOF, THAT COULD CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED PROPERTY RESERVES (BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION) INCLUDE.

INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -34% TO 26% (AVERAGING -10%)

FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM -14% TO 7% (AVERAGING -5%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON,

OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. BECAUSE THE HIGH END OF THE COMPANY'S RANGE OF HISTORICAL ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT COMES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESSES THAT THE COMPANY HAS SINCE EXITED, THE COMPANY

133

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BELIEVES

THAT THE INDUSTRY'S RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. PROPERTY RESERVES REPRESENT

APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

SINCE

PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE, THE ONE YEAR CHANGE FOR PROPERTY CAN BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THAT FOR THE LONGER TAIL PRODUCT LINES. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE

MAJORITY OF THE RESERVE FOR PROPERTY RELATES TO THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE MOST UNCERTAINTY FOR ALL PRODUCT LINES. THIS RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR UNCERTAINTY IS RELEVANT TO

PROPERTY BECAUSE OF WEATHER RELATED EVENTS WHICH, NOTWITHSTANDING 2010 EXPERIENCE, TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, AND GENERALLY ARE NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING

YEAR. RESERVE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CATASTROPHES MAY TAKE EVEN LONGER TO RESOLVE. THE RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE ARE ALSO POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO MATERIAL CHANGES DUE TO

UNCERTAINTY IN MEASURING ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR UNPRECEDENTED SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 AND HURRICANE KATRINA.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -25% FOR 2010, -9% FOR 2009 AND -22% FOR 2008. THE 2010 CHANGE PRIMARILY OCCURRED

IN THE 2008 AND 2009 ACCIDENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN INDUSTRY-FOCUSED UNDERWRITING AND TARGET RISK UNDERWRITING. THE 2009 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BETTER

THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE 2007 AND 2008 ACCIDENT YEARS FOR CERTAIN LARGE NATIONAL PROPERTY AND INLAND MARINE EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE 2005 ACCIDENT YEAR EXPERIENCE IMPROVED DUE TO THE

LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO, AND ONGOING CLAIM SETTLEMENTS FOR, HURRICANE KATRINA. THE 2008 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE 2007 ACCIDENT YEAR FOR CERTAIN LARGE

PROPERTY, NATIONAL PROGRAMS AND OCEAN MARINE CLAIM EXPOSURES, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO, AND ONGOING CLAIM SETTLEMENTS FOR, HURRICANE KATRINA.

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND, THEREFORE,

INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE, IT GENERALLY TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS, WHILE FOR THE OTHER COVERAGES, GENERALLY FOR THE LIABILITY

COVERAGES, IT TAKES A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS.

THE

RESERVING RISK FOR THIS LINE IS DOMINATED BY THE LIABILITY COVERAGE PORTION OF THIS PRODUCT, EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY IN THE EVENT OF CATASTROPHIC OR LARGE SINGLE LOSSES. THE RESERVING

RISK FOR THIS LINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE AND THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CUSTOMER. COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL IS GENERALLY SOLD TO SMALLER-SIZED

ACCOUNTS, WHILE THE CUSTOMER PROFILE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY AND PROPERTY INCLUDES LARGER CUSTOMERS.

SEE

"PROPERTY RISK FACTORS" AND "GENERAL LIABILITY RISK FACTORS," DISCUSSED ABOVE, WITH REGARD TO RESERVING RISK FOR COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL.

UNANTICIPATED

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL), A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.2% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS

RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -16% TO 2% (AVERAGING -5%)

FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM -5% TO 6% (AVERAGING 1%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS

DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL RESERVES (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES) REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

134

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THIS LINE COMBINES GENERAL LIABILITY AND PROPERTY COVERAGES AND IT HAS BEEN IMPACTED IN THE PAST BY MANY OF THE SAME EVENTS AS THOSE TWO

LINES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 0% FOR 2010, -8% FOR 2009 AND -16% FOR 2008. THE 2009 AND 2008 CHANGES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AND ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE CHANGE WAS IMPROVEMENT IN THE

LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO, AND ONGOING CLAIM SETTLEMENTS FOR, HURRICANE KATRINA.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE IS A MIX OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGES AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL

COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE

DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. IN GENERAL, CLAIM REPORTING LAGS ARE MINOR, CLAIM COMPLEXITY IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE, AND THE

LINE IS VIEWED AS HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

COMMERCIAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN FOUR COMPONENTS: BODILY INJURY LIABILITY; PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY; COLLISION CLAIMS; AND COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS. THESE LAST TWO

COMPONENTS HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT PRESENTED.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES THE TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS MENTIONED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOVE IN ESTIMATING CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE. THIS IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH DETAILED CUSTOM

ANALYSES WHERE NEEDED.

AUTOMOBILE, A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.2% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -10% TO 9% (AVERAGING -3%)

FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM -3% TO 9% (AVERAGING 1%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS

DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -1% FOR 2010, -6% FOR 2009 AND -7% FOR 2008. THE 2009 AND 2008 CHANGES WERE A

RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY FOR RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS, WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AND ENHANCED RISK

CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES.

WORKERS' COMPENSATION

WORKERS' COMPENSATION IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL COVERAGE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE CLAIMS

FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. WHILE CERTAIN PAYMENTS SUCH AS INITIAL MEDICAL TREATMENT OR TEMPORARY WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR THE INJURED WORKER ARE MADE QUICKLY, SOME OTHER PAYMENTS ARE MADE OVER THE COURSE

OF SEVERAL YEARS, SUCH AS AWARDS FOR PERMANENT PARTIAL INJURIES. IN ADDITION, SOME PAYMENTS CAN RUN AS LONG AS THE INJURED WORKER'S LIFE, SUCH AS PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS AND ON-GOING

MEDICAL CARE. DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY OF LONG PAYMENT TAILS, THE REPORTING LAGS ARE GENERALLY SHORT, SETTLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT COMPLEX, AND MOST OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE CONSIDERED HIGH FREQUENCY

WITH MODERATE SEVERITY. THE LARGEST RESERVE RISK GENERALLY COMES FROM THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY CLAIMS PROVIDING LIFETIME COVERAGE FOR MEDICAL EXPENSE ARISING FROM A WORKER'S INJURY. OVERALL,

THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A SOMEWHAT GREATER THAN MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

WORKERS'

COMPENSATION RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN THREE COMPONENTS: INDEMNITY LOSSES, MEDICAL LOSSES AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

EXAMPLES

OF COMMON RISK FACTORS, OR PERCEPTIONS THEREOF, THAT COULD CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESERVES (BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -1% TO 2% (AVERAGING 0%) FOR THE COMPANY,

AND FROM -1% TO 4% (AVERAGING 1%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESERVES

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 32% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -1% IN 2010, -1% IN 2009 AND 1% FOR 2008.

FIDELITY AND SURETY

FIDELITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. IT TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE FIDELITY

CLAIMS. THE VOLATILITY OF FIDELITY RESERVES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS OF THE INSURED, THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE INSURED'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT AND

ATTACHMENT POINT OF COVERAGE. THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING RESERVES FOR SMALL, COMMERCIAL INSUREDS IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN THE UNCERTAINTY FOR LARGE COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE HIGH

FREQUENCY, LOW SEVERITY NATURE OF SMALL COMMERCIAL FIDELITY LOSSES PROVIDES FOR STABILITY IN LOSS ESTIMATES WHEREAS, THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY NATURE OF LOSSES FOR LARGE INSUREDS RESULTS IN A

WIDER RANGE OF ULTIMATE LOSS OUTCOMES. ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES THAT RELY ON A STABLE PATTERN OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT ARE GENERALLY NOT APPLICABLE TO LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY POLICIES.

SURETY

HAS CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED SHORT TAIL COVERAGES WITH SHORT REPORTING LAGS, ALTHOUGH LARGE INDIVIDUAL CONSTRUCTION AND COMMERCIAL SURETY CONTRACTS CAN

RESULT IN A LONG SETTLEMENT TAIL, BASED ON THE LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OR COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION BEING INSURED. (LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS CAN TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE.)

THE FREQUENCY OF LOSSES IN SURETY CORRELATES WITH ECONOMIC CYCLES AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF SURETY LOSS IS THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S INSUREDS TO PERFORM FINANCIALLY. THE VOLATILITY OF SURETY LOSSES

IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS PERFORMED BY THE INSURED, THE TYPE OF BONDED OBLIGATION, THE AMOUNT OF LIMIT EXPOSED TO LOSS AND THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS AVAILABLE TO THE INSURER TO MITIGATE

LOSSES, SUCH AS UNBILLED CONTRACT FUNDS, COLLATERAL, FIRST AND THIRD PARTY INDEMNITY, AND OTHER SECURITY POSITIONS OF AN

INSURED'S

ASSETS. CERTAIN CLASSES OF SURETY CLAIMS ARE VERY HIGH SEVERITY, LOW FREQUENCY IN NATURE. THESE CAN INCLUDE LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS INVOLVED WITH ONE OR MULTIPLE LARGE, COMPLEX

PROJECTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN LARGE COMMERCIAL SURETY EXPOSURES. OTHER CLAIM FACTORS AFFECTING RESERVE VARIABILITY OF SURETY INCLUDE LITIGATION RELATED TO AMOUNTS OWED BY AND DUE THE INSURED

(E.G., SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION EFFORTS) AND THE RESULTS OF FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF AN INSURED.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -10% TO 138% (AVERAGING 19%) FOR THE

COMPANY, AND FROM -13% TO 24% (AVERAGING 6%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING

THE YEAR. BECAUSE THE HIGH END OF THE COMPANY'S RANGE WAS DUE TO ACQUIRED BUSINESS IN 2004, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE INDUSTRY'S RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE

ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. FIDELITY AND SURETY RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

IN

GENERAL, DEVELOPMENTS ON SINGLE LARGE CLAIMS (BOTH ADVERSE AND FAVORABLE) ARE A PRIMARY SOURCE OF CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -6% FOR 2010, -7% FOR 2009 AND -10% FOR 2008. THE 2010 CHANGE WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER

THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT DUE TO LOWER THAN EXPECTED CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS SEVERITY, PRIMARILY FOR THE CONTRACT SURETY BUSINESS IN THIS PRODUCT LINE FOR THE 2008 AND PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS. THE

2009 AND 2008 CHANGES WERE A RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CONTRACT SURETY BUSINESS

WITHIN THIS PRODUCT LINE, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS ON LARGE CLAIMS FROM OLDER ACCIDENT YEARS.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL

DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. REPORTING LAGS ARE

RELATIVELY SHORT AND THE CLAIM SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY GENERALLY IS THE LEAST COMPLEX OF THE LIABILITY PRODUCTS. IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO

MODERATE SEVERITY PRODUCT LINE. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

PERSONAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN FIVE COMPONENTS: BODILY INJURY LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY, NO-FAULT LOSSES, COLLISION CLAIMS AND

COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS. THESE LAST TWO COMPONENTS HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE FACTORS ARE NOT PRESENTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 0% FOR 2010, 0% FOR 2009 AND -1% FOR 2008. THE DECREASE IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED

RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES AS WELL AS INITIATIVES TO FIGHT FRAUD.

HOMEOWNERS AND PERSONAL LINES OTHER

HOMEOWNERS IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. MOST PAYMENTS ARE RELATED TO THE PROPERTY PORTION OF THE POLICY, WHERE THE

CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE INSURER. CLAIMS ON PROPERTY COVERAGE ARE TYPICALLY REPORTED SOON AFTER THE ACTUAL DAMAGE OCCURS, ALTHOUGH DELAYS

OF SEVERAL MONTHS ARE NOT UNUSUAL. THE CLAIM IS SETTLED WHEN THE TWO PARTIES AGREE ON THE AMOUNT DUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICY CONTRACT LANGUAGE AND THE APPROPRIATE PAYMENT IS MADE (OR

ALTERNATIVELY, THE PROPERTY REPLACEMENT/REPAIR IS PERFORMED BY THE INSURER). THE RESULTING SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS TYPICALLY FAIRLY SHORT TERM, ALTHOUGH EXCEPTIONS DO EXIST.

THE

LIABILITY PORTION OF THE HOMEOWNERS POLICY GENERATES CLAIMS WHICH TAKE LONGER TO PAY DUE TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF LITIGATION AND NEGOTIATION, BUT WITH GENERALLY SMALL REPORTING LAGS. IN

ADDITION, RESERVES RELATED TO UMBRELLA COVERAGES HAVE GREATER UNCERTAINTY SINCE UMBRELLA LIABILITY PAYMENTS ARE OFTEN MADE FAR INTO THE FUTURE.

OVERALL,

THE LINE IS GENERALLY HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY (EXCEPT FOR CATASTROPHES), WITH SIMPLE TO MODERATE CLAIM COMPLEXITY.

HOMEOWNERS

RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN TWO COMPONENTS: NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED LOSSES AND CATASTROPHE LOSS PAYMENTS.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE (EXCLUDING THE UMBRELLA LINE OF BUSINESS, WHICH FOR STATUTORY REPORTING PURPOSES IS INCLUDED

WITH THE GENERAL LIABILITY LINE OF BUSINESS) OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -31% TO 3% (AVERAGING -12%) FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM -8% TO 11% (AVERAGING

-2%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS

RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. HOMEOWNERS AND PERSONAL LINES OTHER RESERVES REPRESENT

APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THIS

LINE COMBINES BOTH LIABILITY AND PROPERTY COVERAGES; HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVES RELATE TO PROPERTY. WHILE PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE, THE ONE YEAR

CHANGE FOR PROPERTY CAN BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THAT FOR THE LONGER TAIL PRODUCT LINES. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVE FOR PROPERTY RELATES TO THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR,

WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE MOST UNCERTAINTY FOR ALL PRODUCT LINES. THIS RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR UNCERTAINTY IS RELEVANT TO PROPERTY BECAUSE OF WEATHER RELATED EVENTS WHICH TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE

SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, AND GENERALLY ARE NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. RESERVE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CATASTROPHES MAY TAKE EVEN LONGER TO RESOLVE.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE (EXCLUDING THE UMBRELLA LINE OF BUSINESS) WAS 2% FOR 2010, -14% FOR 2009 AND -13% FOR 2008. THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE INCLUDING THE UMBRELLA LINE OF BUSINESS WAS -4% FOR 2010, -12% FOR 2009 AND -12% FOR 2008. THE 2010

CHANGE REFLECTED FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE 2008 AND PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS, PRIMARILY FOR THE UMBRELLA LINE OF BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE 2009 ACCIDENT

YEAR FOR THE HOMEOWNERS LINE OF BUSINESS THAT WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED LATE-REPORTED CLAIMS RELATED TO STORMS IN 2009. THE 2009 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED FAVORABLE LOSS

DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO HURRICANES IKE AND KATRINA, AS WELL AS THE 2007 CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES. THE 2008 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA, BY CLAIM

INITIATIVES, BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED OUTCOMES ON 2007 CATASTROPHE-RELATED CLAIMS AND BY IMPROVEMENTS IN OLDER ACCIDENT YEARS FOR THE UMBRELLA LINE.

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER INCLUDES PRODUCTS WRITTEN BY INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER PRODUCTS NOT DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF

"OTHER" CLAIM RESERVES IS ASSUMED REINSURANCE WRITTEN ON AN EXCESS-OF-LOSS BASIS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE REINSURANCE OF NON-U.S. EXPOSURES, AND IS RUNOFF BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL

AND OTHER CLAIM LIABILITIES RESULT FROM A MIX OF COVERAGES, CURRENCIES AND JURISDICTIONS/COUNTRIES. THE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC IS THE NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE ANALYSIS TO THE

INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT, AND THE INABILITY TO RELY ON DATA CHARACTERIZATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. STATUTORY REPORTING FRAMEWORK.

DUE

TO CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS MIX FOR THIS LINE OVER TIME, THE RECENTLY INCURRED CLAIM LIABILITIES ARE RELATIVELY SHORT TERM (DUE TO BOTH THE PRODUCTS AND THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED,

E.G., THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM), WHILE THE OLDER LIABILITIES INCLUDE SOME FROM RUNOFF OPERATIONS THAT ARE EXTREMELY LONG TAIL (E.G., U.S. EXCESS LIABILITIES

REINSURED THROUGH THE LONDON MARKET, AND SEVERAL UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF). THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION, THE

DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (E.G., UNDERWRITING POOL VERSUS DIRECT) AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE INSURANCE SALE TO THE INSURED HAZARD (E.G., INSURED AND INSURER LOCATED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES). IN

PARTICULAR, LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS, SETTLEMENT LAGS AND CLAIM COMPLEXITY, DUE TO THE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER POOL

MEMBERS OR CO-INSURERS THROUGH A BROKER OR LEAD-INSURER FOR CLAIM SETTLEMENT PURPOSES.

141

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERNATIONAL

AND OTHER RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED BY PROGRAM/POOL, COUNTRY AND GENERAL COVERAGE CATEGORY (E.G., U.S. LIABILITYEXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE, OR

GENERAL LIABILITYMUNICIPALITIESBY COUNTRY). THE BUSINESS IS ALSO GENERALLY SPLIT BY DIRECT VERSUS ASSUMED REINSURANCE FOR A GIVEN COVERAGE/JURISDICTION. WHERE THE UNDERLYING

INSURED HAZARD IS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE UNDERLYING COVERAGES ARE GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND AUTOMOBILE DISCUSSION ABOVE, BUT UNDER A DIFFERENT LEGAL

SYSTEM. WHERE THE UNDERLYING HAZARD IS WITHIN THE U.S., THE COVERAGE INVOLVED IS TYPICALLY THAT OF GENERAL LIABILITY, BUT ON AN EXCESS OR EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE BASIS.

EXCESS EXPOSURE REQUIRES THE INSURED TO "PROVE" NOT ONLY CLAIMS UNDER THE POLICY, BUT ALSO THE PRIOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS REACHING UP TO THE EXCESS POLICY'S ATTACHMENT POINT.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND

MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY BECOMES INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO

DETERMINE THE COMPANY'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

142

VARIOUS

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

THE

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS THAT THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AS PART OF ITS CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAMS ARE DUAL TRIGGER CONTRACTS AND MEET THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS REINSURANCE

IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDANCE FOR ACCOUNTING FOR REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY'S CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAMS ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE" SECTION HEREIN.

THE

COMPANY REPORTS ITS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ONGOING REVIEW OF

AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES. FROM TIME TO TIME, AS A RESULT OF THE

LONG-TAILED NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING LIABILITIES, COVERAGE COMPLEXITIES AND POTENTIAL FOR DISPUTES, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE COMMUTATION OF REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND COMMUTATION ACTIVITY COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES.

RECOVERABLES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS RELATE PRIMARILY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION, FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COMPANIES ISSUING THE ANNUITIES. RECOVERABLES ATTRIBUTABLE TO MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS RELATE

PRIMARILY TO WORKERS' COMPENSATION SERVICE BUSINESS. THESE RECOVERABLES ARE SUPPORTED BY THE PARTICIPATING INSURANCE

COMPANIES' OBLIGATION TO PAY A PRO RATA SHARE BASED ON EACH COMPANY'S VOLUNTARY MARKET SHARE OF WRITTEN PREMIUM IN EACH STATE IN WHICH IT IS A POOL PARTICIPANT. IN THE EVENT A MEMBER OF A MANDATORY

POOL OR ASSOCIATION DEFAULTS ON ITS SHARE OF THE POOL'S OR ASSOCIATION'S OBLIGATIONS, THE OTHER MEMBERS' SHARE OF SUCH OBLIGATION INCREASES PROPORTIONALLY.

INVESTMENT VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENTS

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN THE FAIR

VALUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON THE INPUTS USED IN VALUATION, GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND REQUIRES THAT OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED IN THE

VALUATIONS WHEN AVAILABLE. THE DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON WHETHER THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE OBSERVABLE. IN

DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY IN WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS DISCLOSED, THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THAT REFLECT THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT MARKET ASSUMPTIONS. THE THREE LEVELS OF THE HIERARCHY ARE AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1UNADJUSTED

QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY

TO ACCESS.



LEVEL 2QUOTED

PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS; OR VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE (E.G., INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULT RATES, LOSS

SEVERITIES, ETC.) OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.



LEVEL 3VALUATIONS

BASED ON MODELS WHERE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT THE COMPANY'S

OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE INPUTS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE, UNRELATED, WILLING PARTIES, I.E., NOT IN A FORCED TRANSACTION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MAY DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED IF THE

SECURITY WAS SOLD IN AN IMMEDIATE SALE, E.G., A FORCED TRANSACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUATION OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE LESS LIQUID DUE TO THE LACK OF

MARKET BASED INPUTS, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE PRICE AT WHICH AN ACTUAL TRANSACTION WOULD OCCUR.

FOR

INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, THE COMPANY USES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDES THESE PRICES IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN

LEVEL 1 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES FROM A THIRD PARTY, NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICE (PRICING SERVICE). WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE UNAVAILABLE,

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS MAINLY USED FOR ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES PROVIDED FROM THIS PRICING SERVICE ARE

INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND AN ESTIMATE FROM A PRICING SERVICE ARE UNAVAILABLE, THE COMPANY PRODUCES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE

BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, WILL RENDER THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE AS LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3. THE COMPANY

BASES ALL OF ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR ASSETS ON THE BID PRICE AS IT REPRESENTS WHAT A THIRD-PARTY MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY IN AN ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION.

FIXED MATURITIES

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 99% OF ITS FIXED MATURITIES. THE PRICING

SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. SINCE FIXED MATURITIES OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES GENERALLY DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY

BASIS, THE PRICING SERVICE PREPARES ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE

144

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MEASUREMENTS

FOR THESE SECURITIES USING ITS PROPRIETARY PRICING APPLICATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE AVAILABLE RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, BENCHMARK CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR GROUPINGS

AND MATRIX PRICING. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRICING SERVICE USES AN OPTION ADJUSTED SPREAD MODEL TO DEVELOP PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS.

THE

PRICING SERVICE EVALUATES EACH ASSET CLASS BASED ON RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, RELEVANT CREDIT INFORMATION, PERCEIVED MARKET MOVEMENTS AND SECTOR NEWS. THE MARKET INPUTS UTILIZED

IN THE PRICING EVALUATION, LISTED IN THE APPROXIMATE ORDER OF PRIORITY, INCLUDE: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES, BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, TWO-SIDED MARKETS, BENCHMARK

SECURITIES, BIDS, OFFERS, REFERENCE DATA, AND INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. THE EXTENT OF THE USE OF EACH MARKET INPUT DEPENDS ON THE ASSET CLASS AND THE MARKET CONDITIONS. DEPENDING ON THE SECURITY,

THE PRIORITY OF THE USE OF INPUTS MAY CHANGE OR SOME MARKET INPUTS MAY NOT BE RELEVANT. FOR SOME SECURITIES, ADDITIONAL INPUTS MAY BE NECESSARY.

THE

PRICING SERVICE UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED THAT THEY WILL ONLY PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IF THERE IS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE INFORMATION TO PRODUCE A VALUATION. IF

THE PRICING SERVICE DISCONTINUES PRICING AN INVESTMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE USING SOME OF THE SAME METHODOLOGIES AS THE PRICING SERVICE BUT WOULD HAVE TO

MAKE ASSUMPTIONS FOR MARKET-BASED INPUTS THAT ARE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF MOST FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION RATHER THAN MARKET QUOTES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH FIXED

MATURITIES, OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES IS INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 AS THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON UNADJUSTED MARKET PRICES.

THE

COMPANY REVIEWS THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE AND COMPARES THE ESTIMATES TO THE COMPANY'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE MARKET TO DETERMINE IF THE ESTIMATES OBTAINED

ARE

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PRICES IN THE MARKET. THE COMPANY PRODUCES A REPORT MONTHLY THAT LISTS ALL PRICE CHANGES FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH IN EXCESS OF 10%. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE REPORT AND WILL

CHALLENGE ANY PRICES DEEMED NOT TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS OTHER PROCESSES INCLUDING RANDOMLY SELECTING PURCHASED OR SOLD SECURITIES AND

COMPARING EXECUTION PRICES TO THE ESTIMATES FROM THE PRICING SERVICE AS WELL AS REVIEWING REPORTS THAT CONTAIN SECURITIES WHOSE VALUATION DID NOT CHANGE FROM THEIR PREVIOUS VALUATION (STALE PRICE

REVIEW). THE COMPANY ALSO USES AN ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICE TO FURTHER TEST THE PRIMARY PRICING SERVICE'S VALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO. THESE PROCESSES HAVE NOT

HIGHLIGHTED ANY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE.

THE

COMPANY HOLDS PRIVATELY PLACED CORPORATE BONDS AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL MATRIX THAT IS BASED ON MARKET INFORMATION REGARDING INTEREST RATES,

CREDIT SPREADS AND LIQUIDITY. THE UNDERLYING SOURCE DATA FOR CALCULATING THE MATRIX OF CREDIT SPREADS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE ARE THE BOFA MERRILL LYNCH U.S. CORPORATE INDEX AND THE BOFA

MERRILL LYNCH HIGH YIELD BB RATED INDEX. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF THESE CORPORATE BONDS IN LEVEL 2, SINCE ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE MARKET OBSERVABLE. AS MANY OF THESE

SECURITIES ARE ISSUED BY PUBLIC COMPANIES, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE COMPANIES' PUBLICLY TRADED DEBT TO TEST THE VALIDITY OF THE INTERNAL PRICING

MATRIX.

WHILE

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL NUMBER OF MUNICIPAL BONDS WHICH ARE NOT VALUED BY THE PRICING SERVICE

AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL PRICING MATRIX WITH SOME UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUATION. DUE TO THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET

INFORMATION, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THESE PARTICULAR BONDS IN LEVEL 3. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL AMOUNT OF FIXED MATURITIES THAT HAVE CHARACTERISTICS

THAT MAKE THEM UNSUITABLE FOR MATRIX PRICING. FOR THESE FIXED MATURITIES, THE COMPANY OBTAINS A QUOTE FROM A BROKER (TYPICALLY A MARKET

145

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAKER).

DUE TO THE DISCLAIMERS ON THE QUOTES THAT INDICATE THAT THE PRICE IS INDICATIVE ONLY, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN LEVEL 3.

SEE

NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF NON-FIXED MATURITIES AND VALUATION OF

INVESTMENTS NOT REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS A PERIODIC REVIEW TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE INVESTED ASSETS HAVING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS. SOME OF THE FACTORS

CONSIDERED IN IDENTIFYING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE: (1) FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, WHETHER THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SELL THE INVESTMENT OR WHETHER IT

IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE INVESTMENT PRIOR TO AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (2) FOR NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY'S

ABILITY AND INTENT TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (3) THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF PRINCIPAL AND

INTEREST FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES (I.E., WHETHER THERE IS A CREDIT LOSS), OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; (4) THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN

AMORTIZED COST FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND (5) THE FINANCIAL CONDITION, NEAR-TERM AND LONG-TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING

THE RELEVANT INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND TRENDS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS AND OFFERING PRICES.

REPORTING OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS

FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL OR FOR WHICH IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WOULD

NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL BEFORE AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE, THE COMPANY SEPARATES THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT OF THE IMPAIRMENT FROM THE AMOUNT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS AND REPORTS THE CREDIT

LOSS COMPONENT IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES.

FOR

NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SELL OR FOR WHICH IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO

SELL BEFORE AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE, THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS INCLUDED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

UPON

RECOGNIZING AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THE NEW COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT IS THE PREVIOUS AMORTIZED COST BASIS LESS THE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RECOGNIZED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE NEW COST BASIS IS NOT ADJUSTED FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE; HOWEVER,

FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW COST BASIS AND THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IS ACCRETED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO NET INVESTMENT INCOME OVER THE REMAINING EXPECTED LIFE OF THE

INVESTMENT.

DUE

TO THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S ANALYSIS AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, ALONG WITH THE JUDGMENT THAT MUST BE APPLIED IN THE ANALYSIS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANY

COULD REACH A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPAIR A SECURITY IF IT HAD ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUER. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ISSUER'S ACTUAL ABILITY TO

MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE COMPANY DETERMINED DURING ITS ANALYSIS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO A DIFFERENT IMPAIRMENT CONCLUSION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SEE NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

UPDATES.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO PREPARE ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP), AS PROMULGATED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB). DURING 2008, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) ISSUED A PROPOSED ROADMAP FOR COMMENT FOR THE POTENTIAL USE IN FILINGS WITH THE SEC OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR U.S.

ISSUERS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS), AS PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (IASB), INSTEAD OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE

ROADMAP CONTAINS MILESTONES THAT, IF ACHIEVED, MAY LEAD THE SEC TO DECIDE IN 2011 TO

REQUIRE THE USE OF IFRS FOR LARGE ACCELERATED FILERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. IN MARCH 2010, THE SEC REAFFIRMED ITS SUPPORT FOR A SINGLE SET OF HIGH QUALITY, GLOBAL STANDARDS AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IFRS

MAY BE BEST POSITIONED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. ADDITIONALLY, THE SEC ESTABLISHED A WORK PLAN FOR ITS STAFF TO EVALUATE WHETHER, WHEN AND HOW IFRS SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE U.S. FINANCIAL

REPORTING SYSTEM. UNDER THE WORK PLAN, THE SEC STAFF WILL EVALUATE SEVERAL KEY ISSUES RELATED TO A POSSIBLE CONVERGENCE TO IFRS. THE SEC IS EXPECTED TO RE-DELIBERATE THE PROPOSED ROADMAP

DURING 2011 TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM CONSTITUENTS AS WELL AS THE RESULT OF THE STAFF'S WORK PLAN. THE IASB AND THE FASB ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A GLOBAL INSURANCE

STANDARD THAT INVOLVES METHODOLOGIES FOR VALUING INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE METHODOLOGIES REQUIRED BY CURRENT GAAP. THE FASB AND THE IASB HAVE ALSO

EMBARKED ON A LONG-TERM PROJECT TO CONVERGE GAAP AND IFRS. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER IT WILL CHOOSE TO, OR BE REQUIRED TO, ADOPT IFRS OR HOW THE ADOPTION OF IFRS (OR THE

CONVERGENCE OF GAAP AND IFRS, INCLUDING THE PROJECT FOR VALUING INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES) MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND PRICES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT

SPREADS), FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND OTHER RELEVANT MARKET RATE OR PRICE CHANGES. MARKET RISK IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE RELATED

UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE TRADED. THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES AND HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE COMPANY'S MARKET RISK

SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES, ARE PRIMARILY ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING.

THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WAS $72.72 BILLION AND $74.97 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 86% AND 88% WAS

INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, APPROXIMATELY 6.0% AND 5.8%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS WERE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO EQUITY PRICE RISK IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY HAS NO DIRECT COMMODITY RISK AND IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS.

THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISKS TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ARE INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES. THE PORTFOLIO DURATION RELATIVE TO

THE LIABILITIES' DURATION IS PRIMARILY MANAGED THROUGH CASH MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND TREASURY FUTURES TRANSACTIONS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDED COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS BACKED BY ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION MORTGAGES AND

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES WITH A COLLECTIVE FAIR VALUE OF $297 MILLION AND $270 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 0.5% AND

0.4% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, RESPECTIVELY). THE DISRUPTION IN SECONDARY INVESTMENT MARKETS FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES PROVIDED THE COMPANY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO

SELECTIVELY ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL

148

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES AT DISCOUNTED PRICES. THE COMPANY PURCHASED $31 MILLION AND $74 MILLION OF SUCH SECURITIES IN 2010

AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DEFINES SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AS INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY EXHIBIT ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING

CHARACTERISTICS: LOW FICO SCORES, ABOVE-PRIME INTEREST RATES, HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS OR HIGH DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIOS. ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION

SECURITIZATIONS ARE THOSE IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES' REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT SCORE BUT DO NOT MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITIES' GUIDELINES

FOR DOCUMENTATION, PROPERTY TYPE, DEBT AND LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING ON THESE SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS HELD BY THE COMPANY WAS "BAA2" AND "A3" AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 INCLUDED SECURITIES ISSUED BY NUMEROUS STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY

REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO), A NUMBER OF WHICH WERE ENHANCED BY THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF AN ISSUER DEFAULT. THE DOWNGRADE OF

CREDIT RATINGS OF INSURERS OF THESE SECURITIES IN RECENT YEARS HAS RESULTED IN A CORRESPONDING DOWNGRADE IN THE RATINGS OF THE SECURITIES TO THE UNDERLYING RATING OF THE RESPECTIVE SECURITY. OF THE

INSURED MUNICIPAL SECURITIES IN THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY 99% WERE RATED AT A3 OR ABOVE, AND APPROXIMATELY 90% WERE RATED AT AA3 OR ABOVE, WITHOUT

THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A LOSS OF THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE WOULD NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE UNDERLYING CREDIT STRENGTH OF THE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITIES. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE UNDERLYING

ISSUERS OF THESE SECURITIES WAS "AA2" AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE ENTIRE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO WAS "AA1" AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WITH AND WITHOUT THE

THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE.

ON

APRIL 2, 2009, MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ISSUED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WERE ASSIGNED A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE

RELATIVELY LOW HISTORICAL RATES OF DEFAULT ON MANY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE COMPANY TYPICALLY SEEKS TO INVEST IN HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY SECURITIES (INCLUDING THOSE

WITH STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS SUCH AS BEING SECURED BY DEDICATED OR PLEDGED SOURCES OF REVENUE), DURING OR FOLLOWING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, THE COMPANY'S MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO COULD BE SUBJECT TO A

HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT OR IMPAIRMENT DUE TO DECLINING MUNICIPAL TAX BASES AND REVENUE. THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUDGET DEFICITS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE

COLLECTABILITY AND VALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO. IN ADDITION, SOME ISSUERS MAY BE UNWILLING TO INCREASE TAX RATES, OR TO REDUCE SPENDING, TO FUND INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS

ON THEIR MUNICIPAL BONDS, OR MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET TO FUND SUCH PAYMENTS. THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD DEFAULTS MAY INCREASE IF

SOME ISSUERS VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO DEFAULT, INSTEAD OF IMPLEMENTING DIFFICULT FISCAL MEASURES, AND THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CONSEQUENCES (SUCH AS REDUCED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS) ARE LESS SEVERE THAN

EXPECTED. THE RISK MAY ALSO INCREASE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN LEGISLATION THAT PERMIT STATES, OR ADDITIONAL MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION OR IF THERE ARE

JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS THAT, IN A BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER PROCEEDING, LESSEN THE VALUE OF STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS.

THE

COMPANY'S TAX-EXEMPT FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TOTALED $39.03 BILLION AND $40.84 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

FEDERAL AND/OR STATE TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED THAT WOULD LESSEN OR IMPROVE SOME OR ALL OF THE TAX ADVANTAGES CURRENTLY BENEFITING THE COMPANY AND RESULT IN AN ADVERSE OR FAVORABLE IMPACT ON

THE VALUE OF THESE HOLDINGS.

THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISK FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT IS INTEREST RATE RISK AT THE TIME OF REFINANCING. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND EVALUATES REFINANCING

OPPORTUNITIES AS MATURITY DATES APPROACH. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S DEBT SEE NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE

"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" SECTION OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS."

149

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURE IS CONCENTRATED IN THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS AND INSURANCE RESERVES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. CASH FLOWS FROM THE

COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY TO FUND INSURANCE

RESERVES AND OTHER LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN THE SAME CURRENCY, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING COMPRISED

APPROXIMATELY 2.5% OF THE TOTAL INVESTED ASSETS AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 2.3% AND 2.1% OF THE TOTAL

INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN OTHER CURRENCIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE NOT MATERIAL.

THERE

WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES WERE MANAGED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ITS PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN FUTURE REPORTING

PERIODS BASED UPON WHAT IS KNOWN OR EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS DEFINED AS THE MEASUREMENT OF POTENTIAL LOSS IN FUTURE EARNINGS, FAIR VALUES OR CASH FLOWS OF MARKET SENSITIVE

INSTRUMENTS RESULTING FROM ONE OR MORE SELECTED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET RATES OR PRICES OVER A SELECTED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE COMPANY'S SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, A

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET RATES IS SELECTED THAT IS EXPECTED TO REFLECT REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN THOSE RATES. "NEAR-TERM" MEANS A PERIOD OF TIME GOING

FORWARD UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET RATES ASSUMED IN THIS DISCLOSURE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE RESULTS OF ANY ACTIONS THAT WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE COMPANY TO MITIGATE SUCH HYPOTHETICAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE.

INTEREST RATE RISK

IN THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL INCLUDES

THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING: FIXED MATURITIES, NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, MORTGAGE LOANS, SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, DEBT

AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO THE COMPANY'S MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INTEREST RATE RISK (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS). THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USES A

100 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES TO MEASURE THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MODEL.

FOR

INVESTED ASSETS WITH PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, ESTIMATES OF PORTFOLIO DURATION AND CONVEXITY ARE USED TO MODEL THE LOSS OF FAIR VALUE THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO RESULT

FROM A PARALLEL INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES. DURATIONS ON INVESTED ASSETS ARE ADJUSTED FOR CALL, PUT AND INTEREST RATE RESET FEATURES. DURATIONS ON TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES ARE ADJUSTED FOR

THE FACT THAT THE YIELDS ON SUCH SECURITIES DO NOT NORMALLY MOVE IN LOCKSTEP WITH CHANGES IN THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE. FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO DURATIONS ARE CALCULATED ON A MARKET VALUE WEIGHTED

BASIS, INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST, USING HOLDINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009.

FOR

DEBT, THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY CALCULATING HYPOTHETICAL DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 ENDING PRICES BASED ON YIELDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE,

COMPARING SUCH HYPOTHETICAL ENDING PRICES TO ACTUAL ENDING PRICES, AND MULTIPLYING THE DIFFERENCE BY THE PAR OR SECURITIES OUTSTANDING.

150

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USED BY THE COMPANY PRODUCES A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.00 BILLION AND $2.34 BILLION BASED ON A

100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

LOSS ESTIMATES DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE INTERVENTIONS THAT THE COMPANY MIGHT REASONABLY UNDERTAKE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE OR AVOID LOSSES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM

EMERGING INTEREST RATE TRENDS. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS VALUE ONLY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF AN INTEREST RATE INCREASE ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS FROM FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS. A

HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FOREIGN DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. THE COMPANY'S ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT A

HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $434 MILLION AND $431 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO COMMENCE A JOINT VENTURE WITH J. MALUCELLI, THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF APPROXIMATELY 43% OF J. MALUCELLI'S COMMON

STOCK. THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE R$625 MILLION BRAZILIAN REAIS (THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT OF WHICH WILL DEPEND ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AT CLOSING) PLUS AN AMOUNT BASED ON A

BRAZILIAN INTER-BANK LENDING RATE (CDI) FROM JANUARY 1, 2011 THROUGH THE CLOSING DATE OF THE TRANSACTION. IN ORDER TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO A SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING OF THE

BRAZILIAN REAIS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACT ON FEBRUARY 7, 2011 IN THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF R$635 MILLION WHICH

EXPIRES ON MARCH 31, 2011.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE

COMPANY). THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE 2009 AND 2008 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM TO THE

2010 PRESENTATION. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES

PARTICIPATING SECURITIES GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS

IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE THAT ADDRESSED WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE

PARTICIPATING SECURITIES PRIOR TO VESTING AND, THEREFORE, SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS ALLOCATION IN COMPUTING EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) UNDER THE "TWO-CLASS METHOD." UNDER THE

GUIDANCE, PARTICIPATING SECURITIES ARE RE-DEFINED TO INCLUDE UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT CONTAIN NON-FORFEITABLE DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS AS PARTICIPATING

SECURITIES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF EPS USING THE "TWO-CLASS METHOD." OUTSTANDING UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AND DEFERRED STOCK UNITS ISSUED UNDER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

CONTAINING SUCH DIVIDEND PARTICIPATION FEATURES ARE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES SUBJECT TO THE "TWO-CLASS METHOD" IN COMPUTING EPS RATHER THAN THE "TREASURY STOCK METHOD."

THE

GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008 AND FOR INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

PROVISIONS OF THE GUIDANCE, ALL PRIOR-PERIOD BASIC AND DILUTED EPS DATA PRESENTED WERE RESTATED TO REFLECT THE RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF ITS COMPUTATIONAL GUIDANCE. THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE ON

JANUARY 1, 2009 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BASIC OR DILUTED EPS.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS

IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE, WHICH PROVIDES CLARIFICATION THAT AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN AN ENTITY HAS THE INTENT TO SELL A DEBT SECURITY OR WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN ENTITY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BEFORE ITS ANTICIPATED

RECOVERY IN VALUE.

ADDITIONALLY,

THE GUIDANCE CHANGES THE PRESENTATION AND AMOUNT OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR INSTANCES IN WHICH

THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL A DEBT SECURITY, OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL A DEBT SECURITY PRIOR TO THE ANTICIPATED RECOVERY OF ITS REMAINING COST

BASIS. THE COMPANY SEPARATES THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT OF THE IMPAIRMENT FROM THE AMOUNT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS AND REPORTS THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

THE IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS IS REPORTED IN "ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES."

158

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

IN

ADDITION TO THE CHANGES IN MEASUREMENT AND PRESENTATION, THE DISCLOSURES RELATED TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS RELATING TO DEBT SECURITIES ARE EXPANDED,

AND ALL SUCH DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED TO BE INCLUDED IN BOTH INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS.

THE

GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE ON APRIL 1, 2009 RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN RETAINED EARNINGS OF

$71 MILLION, WHICH WAS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN "ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES" OF THE SAME AMOUNT.

AS

A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE GUIDANCE, THE AMOUNTS OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME, NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES FROM IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND NET INCOME REPORTED FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2009 WERE DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED UNDER THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE GUIDANCE RESULTED IN LESS NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES FROM

IMPAIRMENTS, AND ACCORDINGLY, AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION AFTER-TAX ($100 MILLION PRETAX) OR $0.11 PER SHARE (BASIC AND DILUTED) IN 2009. THAT

INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT DECREASE IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND, ACCORDINGLY, NET INCOME, OF LESS THAN $0.01 PER SHARE (BASIC AND DILUTED) DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE ACCRETION OF THE

NON-CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT OF IMPAIRED SECURITIES TO THE COMPANY'S PROJECTION OF EXPECTED VALUE FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009.

AMENDMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ELIMINATES THE CONCEPT OF A

QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY AND THE QUANTITATIVE-BASED RISKS AND REWARDS CALCULATION FOR DETERMINING WHICH COMPANY, IF ANY, HAS A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY.

THE UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER A COMPANY HAS: (1) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ENTITY'S ECONOMIC

PERFORMANCE AND (2) THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE LOSSES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE ENTITY OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE ENTITY THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

SIGNIFICANT TO THE ENTITY. AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO BE RE-EVALUATED AS A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY WHEN THE HOLDERS OF THE EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK, AS A GROUP, LOSE THE POWER FROM VOTING

RIGHTS OR SIMILAR RIGHTS TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ENTITY'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED ABOUT A COMPANY'S INVOLVEMENT IN VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES AND AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES OWNED ON OR FORMED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2010. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRING OR RENEWING INSURANCE CONTRACTS

IN OCTOBER 2010, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE TO ADDRESS THE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE FOR THE ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

ACQUIRING OR RENEWING INSURANCE CONTRACTS. THIS GUIDANCE MODIFIES THE DEFINITION OF ACQUISITION COSTS TO SPECIFY THAT A COST MUST BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE SUCCESSFUL ACQUISITION OF A NEW OR RENEWAL

INSURANCE CONTRACT IN ORDER TO BE DEFERRED. IF APPLICATION OF THIS GUIDANCE WOULD RESULT IN THE CAPITALIZATION OF ACQUISITION COSTS THAT HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN CAPITALIZED BY A REPORTING ENTITY, THE

ENTITY MAY ELECT NOT TO CAPITALIZE THOSE COSTS.

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR PERIODS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

INTANGIBLESGOODWILL AND OTHER

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE THAT MODIFIES THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. UNDER THE UPDATED GUIDANCE, GOODWILL IS

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS BY COMPARING THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO MEASURE

THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY. THE SECOND STEP IS TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL, MEASURED IN THE SAME MANNER AS GOODWILL IS RECOGNIZED IN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION, AND COMPARE THAT AMOUNT WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL EXCEEDS THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THAT GOODWILL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS

IS RECOGNIZED IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THAT EXCESS.

THE

UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT BECOMES ZERO OR NEGATIVE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST MUST BE PERFORMED WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT THAT A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS EXISTS. IN CONSIDERING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EXISTS A COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE QUALITATIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE

FACTORS PRESENTED IN EXISTING GUIDANCE THAT TRIGGER AN INTERIM IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL (E.G. A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN BUSINESS CLIMATE OR AN ANTICIPATED SALE OF A REPORTING UNIT).

FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES, THE PROVISIONS OF THE GUIDANCE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2010. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THE

GUIDANCE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INVESTMENTS

FIXED MATURITY AND EQUITY SECURITIES

FIXED MATURITIES INCLUDE BONDS, NOTES AND REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS. FIXED MATURITIES, INCLUDING INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO SECURITIES

LENDING AGREEMENTS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF INCOME TAXES, CREDITED OR CHARGED DIRECTLY TO ACCUMULATED

OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES. EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE PUBLIC COMMON AND NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE WITH CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE, NET OF INCOME TAX, CHARGED OR CREDITED DIRECTLY TO ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES.

REAL ESTATE

THE COMPANY'S REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE WAREHOUSES, OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL LAND AND PROPERTIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY

OWNED. REAL ESTATE IS RECORDED ON THE PURCHASE DATE AT THE PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH GENERALLY REPRESENTS FAIR VALUE, AND IS SUPPORTED BY INTERNAL ANALYSIS OR EXTERNAL APPRAISALS, USING DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW ANALYSES AND OTHER ACCEPTABLE VALUATION TECHNIQUES. REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES IS SUBSEQUENTLY CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. BUILDINGS

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES HAVE AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR AND ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES

FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS

IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS

THE

COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. THE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE HEDGE FUNDS GENERALLY REPORT

INVESTMENTS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED BY THE INVESTEE ARE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY ON A LAG BASIS, WITH THE LAG PERIOD GENERALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE TYPE OF

UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. THE PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION QUARTERLY WHICH IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WITHIN THREE TO SIX

MONTHS FOLLOWING

THE DATE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE HEDGE FUNDS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION MONTHLY, WHICH IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS WITHIN ONE MONTH FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE

COMPANY REGULARLY REQUESTS FINANCIAL INFORMATION FROM THE PARTNERSHIPS PRIOR TO THE RECEIPT OF THE PARTNERSHIPS' FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND RECORDS ANY MATERIAL INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THESE REQUESTS

IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COMMON

STOCK WITH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER

INCLUDED

IN OTHER ARE INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK WITH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITIES, MORTGAGE LOANS, TRADING SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES.

COMMON STOCK WITH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, NET OF INCOME TAX, CHARGED OR CREDITED TO

ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NON-OWNER SOURCES. MORTGAGE LOANS ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. TRADING SECURITIES ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED

IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE DERIVATIVES USED BY THE COMPANY, SEE NOTE 3.

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

INVESTMENT INCOME FROM FIXED MATURITIES AND MORTGAGE LOANS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONSTANT EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD WHICH INCLUDES AN

ADJUSTMENT FOR ESTIMATED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS, IF ANY. THE EFFECTIVE YIELD USED TO DETERMINE AMORTIZATION FOR FIXED MATURITIES SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK (E.G., ASSET-BACKED,

LOAN-BACKED AND STRUCTURED SECURITIES) IS RECALCULATED AND ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY BASED UPON ACTUAL HISTORICAL AND/OR PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM A WIDELY-ACCEPTED

SECURITIES DATA PROVIDER. THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE YIELD FOR HIGHLY RATED PREPAYABLE FIXED MATURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE YIELD FOR

NON-HIGHLY RATED PREPAYABLE FIXED MATURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PROSPECTIVE METHOD. DIVIDENDS ON EQUITY SECURITIES (INCLUDING THOSE WITH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS) AND VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME WHEN DECLARED. RENTAL INCOME ON REAL ESTATE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

OVER

THE LEASE TERM. SEE NOTE 3 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE

EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHEREBY THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF THE INVESTEE'S EARNINGS OR LOSSES IN THE FUND IS REPORTED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME. TRADING SECURITIES ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH THE CHANGE

IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD.

ACCRUAL

OF INCOME IS SUSPENDED ON NON-SECURITIZED FIXED MATURITIES OR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT ARE IN DEFAULT, OR ON WHICH IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AS

SCHEDULED. INTEREST INCOME ON INVESTMENTS IN DEFAULT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED. INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET THAT WERE NOT INCOME-PRODUCING FOR THE

PRECEDING 12 MONTHS WERE NOT MATERIAL.

FOR

FIXED MATURITIES WHERE THE COMPANY RECORDS AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, A DETERMINATION IS MADE AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND WHETHER THE

COMPANY EXPECTS A RECOVERY IN THE VALUE. FOR FIXED MATURITIES WHERE THE COMPANY EXPECTS A RECOVERY IN VALUE, NOT NECESSARILY TO PAR, THE CONSTANT EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD IS UTILIZED AND THE INVESTMENT

IS AMORTIZED TO THE EXPECTED RECOVERY AMOUNT.

INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF PRETAX REVENUES BASED UPON SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE

INVESTMENTS SOLD ON THE TRADE DATE. INCLUDED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON INVESTED ASSETS OTHER THAN THOSE

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AS DESCRIBED IN THE "INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS" SECTION THAT FOLLOWS.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS A PERIODIC REVIEW TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE INVESTED ASSETS HAVING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS. SOME OF THE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN IDENTIFYING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE: (1) FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, WHETHER THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

SELL THE INVESTMENT OR WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE INVESTMENT PRIOR TO AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (2) FOR NON-FIXED

MATURITY INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (3) THE LIKELIHOOD OF

THE RECOVERABILITY OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES (I.E., WHETHER THERE IS A CREDIT LOSS) OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; (4) THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO

WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN AMORTIZED COST FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND (5) THE FINANCIAL CONDITION, NEAR-TERM AND

LONG-TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING THE RELEVANT INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND TRENDS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS AND OFFERING PRICES.

REPORTING OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS

FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL OR FOR WHICH IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WOULD

NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL BEFORE AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE, THE COMPANY SEPARATES THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT OF THE IMPAIRMENT FROM THE AMOUNT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS AND REPORTS THE CREDIT

LOSS COMPONENT IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE

162

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

IMPAIRMENT

RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES.

FOR

NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SELL OR FOR WHICH IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO

SELL BEFORE AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE, THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS INCLUDED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

UPON

RECOGNIZING AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THE NEW COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT IS THE PREVIOUS AMORTIZED COST BASIS LESS THE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RECOGNIZED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE NEW COST BASIS IS NOT ADJUSTED FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE; HOWEVER,

FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEW COST BASIS AND THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IS ACCRETED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO NET INVESTMENT INCOME OVER THE REMAINING EXPECTED LIFE OF THE

INVESTMENT.

DETERMINATION OF CREDIT LOSS

THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE CREDIT LOSS COMPONENT OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS BY UTILIZING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELING TO DETERMINE

THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE SECURITY AND COMPARING THE PRESENT VALUE WITH THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE SECURITY. IF THE AMORTIZED COST IS GREATER THAN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, THE

DIFFERENCE IS CONSIDERED A CREDIT LOSS AND RECOGNIZED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).

FOR

NON-STRUCTURED FIXED MATURITIES (U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES

AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AND CERTAIN CORPORATE DEBT), THE ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IS DETERMINED BY PROJECTING A RECOVERY VALUE AND A RECOVERY

TIME FRAME AND ASSESSING WHETHER FURTHER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WILL BE RECEIVED. THE DETERMINATION OF RECOVERY VALUE INCORPORATES AN ISSUER VALUATION ASSUMPTION UTILIZING ONE OR A COMBINATION OF

VALUATION METHODS AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE UNDISCOUNTED RECOVERY VALUE BY ALLOCATING THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE ISSUER TO THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF THE

PRIORITY OF CLAIMS. THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE SECURITY AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION (OR THE MOST RECENT IMPLIED RATE USED TO ACCRETE THE

SECURITY IF THE IMPLIED RATE HAS CHANGED AS A RESULT OF A PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT) AND AN ESTIMATED RECOVERY TIME FRAME. GENERALLY, THAT TIME FRAME FOR SECURITIES FOR WHICH THE ISSUER IS IN BANKRUPTCY IS

12 MONTHS. FOR SECURITIES FOR WHICH THE ISSUER IS FINANCIALLY TROUBLED BUT NOT IN BANKRUPTCY, THAT TIME FRAME IS GENERALLY 24 MONTHS. INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION ARE

EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS; HOWEVER, FOR SECURITIES FOR WHICH THE ISSUER IS CLASSIFIED AS BANKRUPT OR IN DEFAULT, THE PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION ASSUMES NO INTEREST PAYMENTS AND A SINGLE

RECOVERY AMOUNT.

IN

ESTIMATING THE RECOVERY VALUE, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO A MYRIAD OF FACTORS RELATED TO THE ISSUER INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

REVENUE, MARGIN AND EARNINGS PROJECTIONS, THE LIKELY MARKET OR LIQUIDATION VALUES OF ASSETS, POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL DEBT TO BE INCURRED PRE- OR POST-BANKRUPTCY/RESTRUCTURING, THE

ABILITY TO SHIFT EXISTING OR NEW DEBT TO DIFFERENT PRIORITY LAYERS, THE AMOUNT OF RESTRUCTURING/BANKRUPTCY EXPENSES, THE SIZE AND PRIORITY OF UNFUNDED PENSION OBLIGATIONS, LITIGATION OR OTHER

CONTINGENT CLAIMS, THE TREATMENT OF INTERCOMPANY CLAIMS AND THE LIKELY OUTCOME WITH RESPECT TO INTER-CREDITOR CONFLICTS.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE SECURITY BY PROJECTING FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSETS UNDERLYING THE SECURITIZATION, ALLOCATING THE FLOWS TO THE VARIOUS TRANCHES BASED ON THE STRUCTURE

OF THE SECURITIZATION, AND DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS USING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE SECURITY AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION (OR THE MOST RECENT IMPLIED RATE USED TO ACCRETE THE

SECURITY IF THE IMPLIED RATE HAS CHANGED AS A RESULT OF A PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT OR CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS). THE COMPANY INCORPORATES LEVELS OF DELINQUENCIES, DEFAULTS AND SEVERITIES AS WELL AS

CREDIT ATTRIBUTES OF THE REMAINING ASSETS IN THE SECURITIZATION, ALONG WITH OTHER ECONOMIC DATA, TO ARRIVE AT ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE PARAMETERS APPLIED TO THE ASSETS UNDERLYING THE SECURITIZATION.

IN ORDER TO PROJECT CASH FLOWS, THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPLIED TO THE ASSETS UNDERLYING THE SECURITIZATION: (1) VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT RATES, (2) DEFAULT RATES AND (3) LOSS

SEVERITY. THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THE PRIME, ALT-A AND SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

CHANGES IN INTENT TO SELL TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED ASSETS

THE COMPANY MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, SELL INVESTED ASSETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE THAT IT DID NOT INTEND TO SELL AT THE

BALANCE SHEET DATE. CONVERSELY, THE COMPANY MAY NOT SELL INVESTED ASSETS THAT IT ASSERTED THAT IT INTENDED TO SELL AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. SUCH CHANGES IN INTENT ARE GENERALLY DUE TO EVENTS

OCCURRING SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE TYPES OF EVENTS THAT MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN INTENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

RELATED TO THE INVESTED ASSET (E.G., A DOWNGRADE OR UPGRADE FROM A RATING AGENCY), SIGNIFICANT UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN LIQUIDITY NEEDS, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, THE COMPANY OBTAINS INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS. IN

ADDITION, THE CARRYING VALUE OF ALL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IS REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE. THE REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERS THE VALUATION FROM THE INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL, WHEN APPLICABLE, AND INCORPORATES AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE

USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY.

THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS

IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS

FOR

IMPAIRMENT NO LESS FREQUENTLY THAN QUARTERLY AND MONITORS THE PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MANAGERS/GENERAL PARTNERS. IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF AN IMPAIRMENT

OF A PARTNERSHIP'S INVESTMENTS AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE PARTNERSHIP'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IT WILL RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT BY RECORDING A REDUCTION IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF

THE PARTNERSHIP WITH A CORRESPONDING CHARGE TO NET INVESTMENT INCOME.

MORTGAGE

LOANS

A

MORTGAGE LOAN IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST AMOUNTS DUE. FOR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE

IMPAIRED, A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATES

REFLECTING THE CURRENT REAL ESTATE FINANCING MARKET RETURNS.

SECURITIES LENDING

THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES NET INVESTMENT INCOME BY LENDING CERTAIN OF ITS

INVESTMENTS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. BORROWERS OF THESE SECURITIES PROVIDE COLLATERAL EQUAL TO AT LEAST 102% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST.

THIS COLLATERAL IS HELD BY A THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN, AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE COLLATERAL ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THE INSTITUTION BORROWING THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES IS IN DEFAULT UNDER

THE LENDING AGREEMENT. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RECEIPT OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN OR THE OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE COLLATERAL. THE LOANED SECURITIES

REMAIN A RECORDED ASSET OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ACCEPTS ONLY CASH AS COLLATERAL FOR SECURITIES ON LOAN AND RESTRICTS THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT CASH IS INVESTED.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ONGOING REVIEW OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION

PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. AMOUNTS DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE, INCLUDING AMOUNTS DUE FROM KNOWN INSOLVENT

REINSURERS, ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. ANY SUBSEQUENT COLLECTIONS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF ARE REPORTED AS PART OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM

REINSURER INSOLVENCIES.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

AMOUNTS WHICH VARY WITH AND ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION OF NEW INSURANCE CONTRACTS, CONSISTING OF COMMISSIONS AND

PREMIUM-RELATED TAXES, ARE DEFERRED AND

AMORTIZED PRO RATA OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS IN WHICH THE RELATED PREMIUMS ARE EARNED. DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS ARE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE INCOME AND, IF NOT, ARE

CHARGED TO EXPENSE. FUTURE INVESTMENT INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RELATED PREMIUMS IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MEASURING THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THIS ASSET. ALL OTHER ACQUISITION EXPENSES

ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED.

CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

UNDER CERTAIN WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT FOR THE

FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE POLICYHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. THESE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN

CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES AND CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS A REVIEW, ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, OF GOODWILL HELD BY THE REPORTING UNITS WHICH ARE THE COMPANY'S THREE

OPERATING AND REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: BUSINESS INSURANCE; FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE; AND PERSONAL INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS AND

COMPARES IT TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEED THEIR FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS CALCULATED AND GOODWILL IS ADJUSTED

ACCORDINGLY.

THE

COMPANY USES A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL IS AN INCOME APPROACH TO VALUATION THAT IS BASED ON A

DETAILED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR DERIVING A CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS AND IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTING UNITS' CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY THE COMPANY ARE ALSO REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASSET AS INDEFINITE-LIVED IS REASSESSED, AND AN

IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE A FINITE USEFUL LIFE ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A FINITE USEFUL LIFE IS REGULARLY

REVIEWED FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT IN VALUE. IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE FROM ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND IS MEASURED AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

THE

COMPANY'S REVIEW DID NOT RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF ITS GOODWILL, OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES OR FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NONE OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTING UNITS WERE

AT RISK FOR FAILING THE INITIAL IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT ESTIMATES FOR UNPAID REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND RELATED

EXPENSES. THE RESERVES ARE ADJUSTED REGULARLY BASED UPON EXPERIENCE. INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ARE CERTAIN RESERVES DISCOUNTED TO

THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE LIABILITIES FOR LOSSES FOR MOST LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND ANNUITY CLAIM PAYMENTS, PRIMARILY ARISING FROM WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE

AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE POLICIES, WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 5% AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. THESE DISCOUNTED RESERVES TOTALED $2.09 BILLION AND

$2.16 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

COMPANY PERFORMS A CONTINUING REVIEW OF ITS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, INCLUDING ITS RESERVING TECHNIQUES AND ITS REINSURANCE. THE RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED

REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. THESE RESERVES REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE COST OF

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

ALL

UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. SINCE THE RESERVES ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN SUCH RESERVES. THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATED

RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. SUCH CHANGES IN ESTIMATES COULD OCCUR IN A FUTURE PERIOD AND MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN SUCH PERIOD.

OTHER LIABILITIES

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IS THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITY FOR GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER

INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. THE LIABILITY FOR EXPECTED STATE GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER PREMIUM-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE COMPANY WRITES OR BECOMES OBLIGATED TO WRITE OR RENEW THE

PREMIUMS ON WHICH THE ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE BASED. THE LIABILITY FOR LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE RELATED LOSSES ARE INCURRED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009,

THE COMPANY HAD A LIABILITY OF $235 MILLION AND $293 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS AND RELATED RECOVERABLES OF $6 MILLION AT

BOTH DATES. THE LIABILITY FOR SUCH ASSESSMENTS AND THE RELATED RECOVERABLES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED FOR THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. THE LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PAID OVER A PERIOD

RANGING FROM ONE YEAR TO THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF CERTAIN WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMANTS AND THE RECOVERIES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME.

ALSO

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IS AN ACCRUAL FOR POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS. CERTAIN INSURANCE CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY WORKERS' COMPENSATION, ARE PARTICIPATING WHEREBY DIVIDENDS ARE PAID TO

POLICYHOLDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACT PROVISIONS. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR PARTICIPATING DIVIDEND POLICIES WERE APPROXIMATELY 1% OF TOTAL COMPANY NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008. POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS ARE ACCRUED AGAINST EARNINGS USING BEST AVAILABLE ESTIMATES OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID. THE LIABILITY ACCRUED FOR POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS

TOTALED $45 MILLION AND $46 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

TREASURY STOCK

TREASURY STOCK REPRESENTS THE COST OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH STOCK REPRESENTS AUTHORIZED AND UNISSUED SHARES OF

THE COMPANY UNDER THE MINNESOTA BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT.

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, DOMICILED PRINCIPALLY IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT, PREPARE STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

OF ACCOUNT (NORMALLY THE FOLLOWING YEAR OF ACCOUNT) IN CONSIDERATION FOR WHICH ALL SUBSEQUENT UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS RESULTING FROM THE CLOSING YEAR AND ALL PREVIOUS YEARS REINSURED THEREIN ARE

BROUGHT FORWARD TO (ACCEPTED BY) THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR OF ACCOUNT.

ENVIRONMENT. FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED TO THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, AND THE RESULTING FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS ARE THEN

TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE CHANGE IN UNREALIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION GAIN OR LOSS DURING THE YEAR, NET OF TAX, IS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER

SOURCES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT AND TRANSLATION ARE CALCULATED USING CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES FOR ITEMS REPORTED IN THE BALANCE SHEETS AND AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FOR ITEMS RECORDED IN

EARNINGS.

AWARDS, PARTICIPANTS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, EITHER IN CASH OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT SHARES, COMMENSURATE WITH THE DIVIDENDS PAID TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. DIVIDENDS

AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT SHARES ON AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO VEST ARE RECORDED IN RETAINED EARNINGS. DIVIDENDS PAID IN CASH ARE PRESENTED IN THE "DIVIDENDS" CAPTION OF RETAINED EARNINGS WHILE

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE PRESENTED IN THE "OTHER" CAPTION OF RETAINED EARNINGS. DIVIDENDS ON AWARDS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VEST ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE AND ARE, THEREFORE, RECORDED AS

COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1.

EXCEPT

AS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR CERTAIN LEGAL ENTITIES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES ITS INVESTED ASSETS AND THE RELATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME TO ITS REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. PRETAX NET

INVESTMENT INCOME IS ALLOCATED BASED UPON AN INVESTABLE FUNDS CONCEPT, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT LIABILITIES (NET OF NON-INVESTED ASSETS) AND APPROPRIATE CAPITAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EACH

SEGMENT. FOR INVESTABLE FUNDS, A BENCHMARK INVESTMENT YIELD IS DEVELOPED THAT REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE LOSS RESERVES' FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME THE

LOSSES WERE INCURRED AND A+ RATED CORPORATE DEBT INSTRUMENT YIELDS. FOR CAPITAL, A BENCHMARK INVESTMENT YIELD IS DEVELOPED THAT REFLECTS THE AVERAGE YIELD ON THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE

BENCHMARK INVESTMENT YIELDS ARE APPLIED TO EACH SEGMENT'S INVESTABLE FUNDS AND CAPITAL, RESPECTIVELY, TO PRODUCE A TOTAL NOTIONAL INVESTMENT INCOME BY SEGMENT. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL NET INVESTMENT

INCOME IS ALLOCATED TO EACH SEGMENT IN PROPORTION TO THE RESPECTIVE SEGMENT'S NOTIONAL INVESTMENT INCOME TO TOTAL NOTIONAL INVESTMENT INCOME. THERE ARE CERTAIN LEGAL ENTITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY THAT

ARE DEDICATED TO SPECIFIC REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE INVESTED ASSETS AND RELATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THESE LEGAL ENTITIES ARE REPORTED IN THE APPLICABLE BUSINESS SEGMENT AND ARE NOT

ENTITIES WHICH DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUITY AT RISK TO ALLOW THE ENTITY TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT

VARIABLE INTEREST HOLDER THAT IS DETERMINED TO HAVE THE CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST (PRIMARY BENEFICIARY) AS A RESULT OF HAVING BOTH THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. THE COMPANY

DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF AN ENTITY SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATION BASED ON A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE VIE'S CAPITAL STRUCTURE, CONTRACTUAL TERMS, NATURE OF THE VIE'S

OPERATIONS AND PURPOSE AND THE COMPANY'S RELATIVE EXPOSURE TO THE RELATED RISKS OF THE VIE ON THE DATE IT BECOMES INITIALLY INVOLVED IN THE VIE. THE COMPANY REASSESSES ITS VIE DETERMINATION WITH

RESPECT TO AN ENTITY ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS WHERE THE COMPANY IS NOT RELATED TO THE GENERAL PARTNER. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD AND REPORTED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER INVESTMENTS UNLESS THE COMPANY IS DEEMED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THESE EQUITY INTERESTS

GENERALLY CANNOT BE REDEEMED. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THESE INVESTMENTS ARE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF LIQUIDATION OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS OF THE FUNDS AND/OR AS INCOME DISTRIBUTION. THE

COMPANY'S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS LIMITED TO THE INVESTMENT CARRYING

CONCENTRATIONS AND CREDIT QUALITY

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE FROM EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES THAT ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR ACTIVITIES AND HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC

CHARACTERISTICS THAT COULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC OR OTHER CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY SEEKS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK BY

ACTIVELY MONITORING THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF COUNTERPARTIES, OBTAINING COLLATERAL AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE, AND APPLYING CONTROLS THAT INCLUDE CREDIT APPROVALS, LIMITS OF CREDIT EXPOSURE, AND OTHER

MONITORING PROCEDURES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, THE COMPANY WAS NOT EXPOSED TO ANY

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK OF A SINGLE ISSUER GREATER THAN 5% OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY OF THE COMPANY.

INCLUDED

IN FIXED MATURITIES ARE BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE ASSETS TOTALING $1.88 BILLION AND $1.80 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY

DEFINES ITS BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE ASSETS AS THOSE SECURITIES RATED BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE BY EXTERNAL RATING AGENCIES, OR THE EQUIVALENT BY THE COMPANY WHEN A PUBLIC RATING DOES NOT EXIST. SUCH

ASSETS INCLUDE PUBLICLY TRADED BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE BONDS AND CERTAIN OTHER PRIVATELY ISSUED BONDS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE LOANS.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES U.S. TREASURY NOTE FUTURES TRANSACTIONS TO MODIFY THE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF SPECIFIC ASSETS WITHIN THE INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND ENTERS INTO 90-DAY FUTURES CONTRACTS ON 2-YEAR, 5-YEAR, 10-YEAR AND 30-YEAR U.S. TREASURY NOTES WHICH REQUIRE A DAILY

MARK-TO-MARKET AND SETTLEMENT WITH THE BROKER. THE NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE OPEN U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS WAS $400 MILLION AND $350 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008 INCLUDED NET LOSSES OF $30 MILLION, NET GAINS OF $23 MILLION AND NET LOSSES

OF $53 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS.

IN

2010, 2009 AND 2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OF $5 MILLION, $7 MILLION AND $10 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO ITS HOLDINGS OF SIX

MILLION STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS OF PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD., A PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY. THESE WARRANTS WERE NOT DESIGNATED AND DID NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND,

AS SUCH, THE MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WERE REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). IN OCTOBER 2010, THE COMPANY SOLD THESE STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS FOR

PROCEEDS THAT APPROXIMATED THEIR CARRYING VALUE AT THE DATE OF SALE.

THE

COMPANY PURCHASES INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES. THESE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN VALUE

REFLECTED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). DERIVATIVES EMBEDDED IN CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES ARE REPORTED ON A COMBINED BASIS WITH THEIR HOST INSTRUMENT AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS FIXED

MATURITY SECURITIES. THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSS OF $1 MILLION IN 2010, A NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN OF $1 MILLION IN 2009 AND A NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSS OF

$77 MILLION IN 2008 RELATED TO THESE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. THE COMPANY DIVESTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS HOLDINGS IN CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES IN 2008.

187

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE FRAMEWORK IS BASED

ON THE INPUTS USED IN VALUATION, GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND REQUIRES THAT OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED IN THE VALUATIONS WHEN AVAILABLE. THE DISCLOSURE OF FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES IN THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON WHETHER THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE OBSERVABLE. IN DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY IN WHICH THE

ESTIMATE IS DISCLOSED, THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT MARKET

ASSUMPTIONS. THE THREE LEVELS OF THE HIERARCHY ARE AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1UNADJUSTED QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT THE

COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS.



LEVEL 2QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL

OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS; OR VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE (E.G., INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULT

RATES, LOSS SEVERITIES, ETC.) OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.



LEVEL 3VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

REFLECT THE COMPANY'S OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE INPUTS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE, UNRELATED, WILLING PARTIES, I.E., NOT IN A FORCED TRANSACTION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MAY DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED IF THE

SECURITY WAS SOLD IN AN IMMEDIATE SALE, E.G., A FORCED TRANSACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUATION OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE LESS LIQUID DUE TO THE LACK OF

MARKET BASED INPUTS, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE PRICE AT WHICH AN ACTUAL TRANSACTION WOULD OCCUR.

FOR

INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, THE COMPANY USES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDES THESE PRICES IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN

LEVEL 1 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES FROM A THIRD PARTY, NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICE (PRICING SERVICE). WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE UNAVAILABLE,

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS MAINLY USED FOR ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES PROVIDED FROM THIS PRICING SERVICE ARE

INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND AN ESTIMATE FROM A PRICING SERVICE ARE UNAVAILABLE, THE COMPANY PRODUCES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE

BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, WILL RENDER THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE AS LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3. THE COMPANY

BASES ALL OF ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR ASSETS ON THE BID PRICE AS IT REPRESENTS WHAT A THIRD-PARTY MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY IN AN ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION.

188

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)

FIXED MATURITIES

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 99% OF ITS FIXED MATURITIES. THE PRICING

SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET

QUOTATIONS FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. SINCE FIXED MATURITIES OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES GENERALLY DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY BASIS, THE PRICING

SERVICE PREPARES ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR THESE SECURITIES USING ITS PROPRIETARY PRICING APPLICATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE AVAILABLE RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, BENCHMARK CURVES,

BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR GROUPINGS AND MATRIX PRICING. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRICING SERVICE USES AN OPTION ADJUSTED SPREAD MODEL TO DEVELOP PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS.

THE

PRICING SERVICE EVALUATES EACH ASSET CLASS BASED ON RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, RELEVANT CREDIT INFORMATION, PERCEIVED MARKET MOVEMENTS AND SECTOR NEWS. THE MARKET INPUTS UTILIZED

IN THE PRICING EVALUATION, LISTED IN THE APPROXIMATE ORDER OF PRIORITY, INCLUDE: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES, BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, TWO-SIDED MARKETS, BENCHMARK

SECURITIES, BIDS, OFFERS, REFERENCE DATA, AND INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. THE EXTENT OF THE USE OF EACH MARKET INPUT DEPENDS ON THE ASSET CLASS AND THE MARKET CONDITIONS. DEPENDING ON THE SECURITY,

THE PRIORITY OF THE USE OF INPUTS MAY CHANGE OR SOME MARKET INPUTS MAY NOT BE RELEVANT. FOR SOME SECURITIES, ADDITIONAL INPUTS MAY BE NECESSARY.

THE

PRICING SERVICE UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED THAT THEY WILL ONLY PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IF THERE IS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE INFORMATION TO PRODUCE A VALUATION. IF

THE PRICING SERVICE DISCONTINUES PRICING AN INVESTMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE USING SOME OF THE SAME METHODOLOGIES AS THE PRICING SERVICE BUT WOULD HAVE TO

MAKE ASSUMPTIONS FOR MARKET-BASED INPUTS THAT ARE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF MOST FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION RATHER THAN MARKET QUOTES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH FIXED

MATURITIES, OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES IS INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 AS THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON UNADJUSTED MARKET PRICES.

THE

COMPANY HOLDS PRIVATELY PLACED CORPORATE BONDS AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL MATRIX THAT IS BASED ON MARKET INFORMATION REGARDING INTEREST RATES,

CREDIT SPREADS AND LIQUIDITY. THE UNDERLYING SOURCE DATA FOR CALCULATING THE MATRIX OF CREDIT SPREADS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE ARE THE BOFA MERRILL LYNCH U.S. CORPORATE INDEX AND THE BOFA

MERRILL LYNCH HIGH YIELD BB RATED INDEX. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF THESE CORPORATE BONDS IN LEVEL 2, SINCE ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE MARKET OBSERVABLE. AS MANY OF THESE

SECURITIES ARE ISSUED BY PUBLIC COMPANIES, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE COMPANIES' PUBLICLY TRADED DEBT TO TEST THE VALIDITY OF THE INTERNAL PRICING

MATRIX.

WHILE

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL NUMBER OF MUNICIPAL BONDS WHICH ARE NOT VALUED BY THE PRICING SERVICE

AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL PRICING MATRIX WITH SOME UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUATION. DUE TO THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET

INFORMATION, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THESE PARTICULAR BONDS IN LEVEL 3. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL AMOUNT OF FIXED MATURITIES THAT HAVE CHARACTERISTICS

THAT MAKE THEM UNSUITABLE FOR MATRIX PRICING. FOR THESE FIXED MATURITIES, THE COMPANY OBTAINS A QUOTE FROM A BROKER (TYPICALLY A MARKET

189

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)

MAKER).

DUE TO THE DISCLAIMERS ON THE QUOTES THAT INDICATE THAT THE PRICE IS INDICATIVE ONLY, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN LEVEL 3.

EQUITIESPUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED

FOR PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS, THE COMPANY RECEIVES PRICES FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICE THAT ARE BASED ON

OBSERVABLE MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND INCLUDES THESE ESTIMATES IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF STOCKS HAVING TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS THAT EXPIRE WITHIN ONE YEAR WAS

DETERMINED BY ADJUSTING THE OBSERVED MARKET PRICE OF THE SECURITIES FOR A LIQUIDITY DISCOUNT WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE RESTRICTIONS THAT EXISTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 AND IS

BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS. AS A RESULT OF ADJUSTING THE MARKET PRICE TO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ON ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY DISCLOSES THESE HOLDINGS IN

LEVEL 2. INFREQUENTLY, CURRENT MARKET QUOTES IN ACTIVE MARKETS ARE UNAVAILABLE FOR CERTAIN NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS HELD BY THE COMPANY. IN THESE INSTANCES, THE COMPANY

RECEIVES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FROM THE PRICING SERVICE THAT PROVIDES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITIES. THE SERVICE UTILIZES SOME OF THE SAME METHODOLOGIES TO PRICE THE

NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS AS IT DOES FOR THE FIXED MATURITIES. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE FOR THESE NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS IN THE AMOUNT

DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

COMMON

STOCK WITH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HELD COMMON STOCKS WITH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AFTER ONE YEAR. THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE STOCKS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 USING THE SAME METHODOLOGY DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR COMMON STOCK RESTRICTIONS THAT EXPIRE WITHIN A YEAR, AND DISCLOSED THE FAIR VALUE IN LEVEL 2. IN 2010, THE COMPANY

SOLD SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE SHARES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HELD INVESTMENTS IN NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES, WITH FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF $57 MILLION AND

$60 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REPORTED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS, WHERE THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE IS DETERMINED EITHER INTERNALLY OR BY AN EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER BASED ON RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING

RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTALS. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN THESE VALUATIONS, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE

ESTIMATE FOR ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 3. THE COMPANY HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS PUBLICLY-TRADED SECURITIES WHICH ARE

REPORTED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE $42 MILLION AND $46 MILLION FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, IS DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1. THESE

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE SECURITIES IN THE COMPANY'S TRADING PORTFOLIO, MUTUAL FUNDS AND OTHER SMALL HOLDINGS.

DERIVATIVES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HELD $37 MILLION AND $39 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF CONVERTIBLE BONDS

CONTAINING EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS THAT ARE VALUED SEPARATELY FROM THE HOST BOND CONTRACT IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2FIXED MATURITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE

COMPANY HELD NON-PUBLIC STOCK WARRANTS IN A PUBLIC COMPANY FOR WHICH IT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE USING AN

TRANSFERS

OUT OF LEVEL 3 DURING 2009 INCLUDED A $230 MILLION TRANSFER RESULTING FROM A PRIVATE COMMON STOCK HOLDING UNDERGOING AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.

THE NEW PUBLIC SECURITY HAS TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND IS REPORTED IN LEVEL 2.

THE

COMPANY HAD NO FINANCIAL ASSETS OR FINANCIAL LIABILITIES THAT WERE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

2009.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DISCLOSED, BUT NOT CARRIED, AT FAIR VALUE

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE EXCLUDED

FROM FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNTS DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE

CARRYING VALUES OF CASH, SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT INCOME ACCRUED APPROXIMATED THEIR FAIR VALUES.

THE

CARRYING VALUES OF $647 MILLION AND $629 MILLION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS APPROXIMATED THEIR FAIR VALUES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE CARRYING VALUES OF $3.75 BILLION AND $3.89 BILLION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY,

ALSO APPROXIMATED THEIR FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING VARIOUS METHODS INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AS APPROPRIATE FOR THE VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE

CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS $6.61 BILLION AND $7.20 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESPECTIVE TOTALS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 WERE $6.53 BILLION AND $6.82 BILLION. THE COMPANY UTILIZED A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 94% AND 96% OF ITS DEBT, OTHER

THAN COMMERCIAL PAPER, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRICING SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR DEBT THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. FOR THE SMALL AMOUNT OF

THE COMPANY'S DEBT SECURITIES FOR WHICH A PRICING SERVICE IS NOT USED, THE COMPANY UTILIZES PRICING ESTIMATES FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BROKER/DEALER TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. IF ESTIMATES OF FAIR

VALUE ARE UNAVAILABLE FROM THE PRICING SERVICE OR THE BROKER/DEALER, THE COMPANY PRODUCES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION TECHNIQUES WHICH ARE BASED ON A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY AND INCORPORATES ALL AVAILABLE RELEVANT OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER INCLUDED IN DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 APPROXIMATED ITS BOOK VALUE BECAUSE OF ITS SHORT-TERM NATURE.

5. REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF ASSUMED AND CEDED REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. ASSUMED REINSURANCE REFERS TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS

THAT OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN. CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES TRANSFERRING CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS (ALONG WITH THE RELATED WRITTEN AND EARNED PREMIUMS) THE COMPANY HAS UNDERWRITTEN TO

OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO AGREE TO SHARE THESE RISKS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF CEDED REINSURANCE IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY, AT A COST, FROM VOLATILITY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT IT IS PREPARED TO

ACCEPT. REINSURANCE IS PLACED ON BOTH A QUOTA-SHARE AND EXCESS OF LOSS BASIS. CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT DISCHARGE THE COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY INSURER, EXCEPT FOR INSTANCES WHERE THE PRIMARY

POLICY OR POLICIES HAVE BEEN NOVATED.

194

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

5. REINSURANCE (CONTINUED)

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE CERTAIN AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS COMPRISE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

SETTLE CERTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE THE COMPANY DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE

STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT IS INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AS THE COMPANY RETAINS THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED

ANNUITY PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS.

THE

COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER

INSOLVENCIES. IN

ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR

AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO DETERMINE THE COMPANY'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE

COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

THE

COMPANY IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS THROUGH ASSUMED REINSURANCE, PRINCIPALLY WITH REGARD TO RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS IN WORKERS'

COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, AS WELL AS HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE IN CERTAIN COASTAL AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PROVIDES SERVICES FOR SEVERAL OF THESE INVOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS ("MANDATORY

POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS") UNDER WHICH IT WRITES SUCH RESIDUAL MARKET BUSINESS DIRECTLY, THEN CEDES 100% OF THIS BUSINESS TO THE MANDATORY POOL. SUCH SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ARRANGED TO MITIGATE

CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY, AS ANY CEDED BALANCES ARE JOINTLY BACKED BY ALL THE POOL MEMBERS.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY WITH UNAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES. IN ADDITION TO THE COVERAGE

PROVIDED UNDER THIS TREATY, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES A CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAM AND A NORTHEAST CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY TO PROTECT AGAINST LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES IN THE

NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES AN EXCESS-OF-LOSS TREATY IN ITS NATIONAL PROPERTY BUSINESS UNIT OF THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT TO PROTECT AGAINST

EARTHQUAKE LOSSES UP TO A CERTAIN THRESHOLD.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM

THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM) IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY THAT PROVIDES

FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN INTEREST. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN

AUTHORIZED THROUGH 2014.

IN

ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS AND MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS

AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, IN CONCURRENCE WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. THE ANNUAL AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUM IS

$100 MILLION

196

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

5. REINSURANCE (CONTINUED)

THROUGH

2014. THE PROGRAM EXCLUDES FROM PARTICIPATION THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE: FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE, PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE,

HEALTH OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD INSURANCE, AND REINSURANCE, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY (OTHER THAN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS'), SURETY, BURGLARY AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS

MULTI-PERIL. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS' COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE PROGRAM. ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN THE UNITED STATES ARE

GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR 85% OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER

DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP.

THE

DEDUCTIBLE FOR ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS EQUAL TO 20% OF THE INSURER'S DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS FOR COVERED LINES FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER

THE PROGRAM IS $2.08 BILLION FOR 2011. THE ANNUAL CAP LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE

$100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, PARTICIPATING INSURERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM FOR ADDITIONAL COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES FOR THAT PROGRAM YEAR. THE COMPANY HAS HAD NO

TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED. SINCE THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS LAW IS UNTESTED, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW THEY WILL BE APPLIED TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES.

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ACTION COULD CHANGE THE ACTS. FURTHER, GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN THE

COMPANY'S OWN REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY "UNCONVENTIONAL" ACTS OF TERRORISM INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD BE

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE PERIODS. WHILE THE COMPANY SEEKS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING

CONVENTIONAL MEANS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ONE OR MORE MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS INVOLVING

SO-CALLED WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, INCLUDING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL MEANS.

THE

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT OF $191 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. AND TRAVELERS

PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. IN 2004 AND WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF NOMINAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES (AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFORMITY WITH THE

ACQUIRER'S ACCOUNTING POLICY ON DISCOUNTING OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESERVES), EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERNS, THE APRIL 1, 2004 U.S. TREASURY SPOT RATE YIELD CURVE, A LEVERAGE RATIO ASSUMPTION

(RESERVES TO STATUTORY SURPLUS), AND A COST OF CAPITAL EXPRESSED AS A SPREAD OVER RISK-FREE RATES. THE METHOD USED CALCULATES A RISK ADJUSTMENT TO A RISK-FREE DISCOUNTED

RESERVE THAT WILL, IF RESERVES RUN OFF AS EXPECTED, PRODUCE RESULTS THAT YIELD THE ASSUMED COST-OF-CAPITAL ON THE CAPITAL SUPPORTING THE LOSS RESERVES. THE FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT IS REPORTED AS AN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSET ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AND THE AMOUNTS MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACQUIRER'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED AS PART OF THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE RECOGNIZED INTO INCOME OVER THE EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERN. BECAUSE THE

TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND THE RISK ADJUSTMENT (COST OF CAPITAL) COMPONENTS OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET RUN OFF AT DIFFERENT RATES, THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN INCOME MAY BE A NET BENEFIT IN SOME PERIODS AND A

NET EXPENSE IN OTHER PERIODS.

THE

$1.31 BILLION DECLINE IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2009 REFLECTED CASH COLLECTIONS AND THE IMPACT OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT,

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT

THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES REGARDING RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ARE ON A "NET OF REINSURANCE" BASIS.

2010.

IN 2010, ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES INCURRED INCLUDED $1.42 BILLION OF NET FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT FOR CLAIMS

ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS, INCLUDING $1.25 BILLION OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IMPACTING THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WHICH EXCLUDES $45 MILLION OF ACCRETION OF

DISCOUNT.

BUSINESS INSURANCE.

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 TOTALED $901 MILLION, DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS

DEVELOPMENT

IN THE PROPERTY, GENERAL LIABILITY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION PRODUCT LINES FOR MULTIPLE ACCIDENT YEARS, AS WELL AS IN ASSUMED REINSURANCE, WHICH IS IN RUNOFF. THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE IMPROVEMENT

PRIMARILY OCCURRED IN THE 2008 AND 2009 ACCIDENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN INDUSTRY-FOCUSED UNDERWRITING AND TARGET RISK UNDERWRITING. THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT

LINE IMPROVEMENT WAS CONCENTRATED IN EXCESS COVERAGES FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2006 AND PRIOR AND REFLECTED WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION PRODUCT LINE WAS CONCENTRATED IN ACCIDENT YEARS 2007 AND PRIOR AND RESULTED FROM BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT. THE IMPROVEMENT IN ASSUMED

REINSURANCE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM FAVORABLE RESOLUTIONS OF CLAIMS AND DISPUTES FROM ACCIDENT YEARS 2002 AND PRIOR. IN ADDITION, BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE

SEGMENT IN RECENT YEARS RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE RE-ESTIMATION OF RESERVES FOR UNALLOCATED LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2010. THE NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THESE

PRODUCT LINES IN 2010 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $140 MILLION AND $35 MILLION INCREASES TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, RESPECTIVELY.

FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE.

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $259 MILLION IN

2010. IN

BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE SURETY AND MANAGEMENT LIABILITY LINES OF BUSINESS DUE

TO LOWER THAN EXPECTED CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS SEVERITY IN THE 2008 AND PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS. IN INTERNATIONAL, THE MAJORITY OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 OCCURRED AT THE

COMPANY'S OPERATION AT LLOYD'S, IN CANADA AND IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

PERSONAL INSURANCE.

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $87 MILLION IN 2010 WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND

OTHER PRODUCT

LINE, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE 2008 AND PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS, PRIMARILY FOR THE UMBRELLA LINE OF BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE 2009

ACCIDENT YEAR FOR THE HOMEOWNERS LINE OF BUSINESS THAT WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED LATE-REPORTED CLAIMS RELATED TO STORMS IN 2009.

2009.

IN 2009, ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES INCURRED INCLUDED $1.45 BILLION OF NET FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT FOR CLAIMS

ARISING IN PRIOR YEARS, INCLUDING $1.33 BILLION OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IMPACTING THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WHICH EXCLUDES $54 MILLION OF ACCRETION OF

DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY PRODUCT LINES FOR RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS. THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PRODUCT LINES EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL

ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS MORE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, CLAIM HANDLING INITIATIVES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN AUTO SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE

IMPROVEMENT PRIMARILY OCCURRED IN THE 2007 AND 2008 ACCIDENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR CERTAIN LARGE NATIONAL PROPERTY AND INLAND MARINE EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION,

THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE'S 2005 ACCIDENT YEAR EXPERIENCE IMPROVED DUE TO THE LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO, AND ONGOING CLAIM SETTLEMENTS FOR, HURRICANE KATRINA.

THE NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THESE PRODUCT LINES IN 2009 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $185 MILLION INCREASE TO ASBESTOS RESERVES AND A $70 MILLION INCREASE TO

DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PRODUCT LINES, AN INCREASE IN ANTICIPATED CEDED RECOVERIES FOR OLDER ACCIDENT YEARS IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY

PRODUCT LINE AND BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINES. THE NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY

AND COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL LINES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING

AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE IMPROVEMENT OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN THE 2007 ACCIDENT YEAR AS A RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR CERTAIN LARGE

NATIONAL PROPERTY, NATIONAL PROGRAMS, AND OCEAN MARINE CLAIM EXPOSURES AND LOWER THAN EXPECTED WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES DURING THE LAST HALF OF 2007, AS WELL AS FAVORABLE LOSS

WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING WHAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE FOREGOING PRODUCT LINES IN 2008 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION PRODUCT LINE,

DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN INTERNATIONAL. THE IMPROVEMENTS IN LONGER-TAIL LINES OF BUSINESS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING ENHANCED RISK CONTROL

AND UNDERWRITING STRATEGIES THROUGHOUT INTERNATIONAL. IN THE PROPERTY LINE OF BUSINESS, THE IMPROVEMENT PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, IN PART

DUE TO FAVORABLE CLAIM ACTIVITY RELATING TO 2007 FLOOD LOSSES. IN BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS, BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CONTRACT SURETY BUSINESS WITHIN THE FIDELITY AND

AS WELL AS BETTER THAN EXPECTED OUTCOMES ON 2007 CATASTROPHE-RELATED CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER PRODUCT LINE EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENT IN OLDER ACCIDENT YEARS FOR THE UMBRELLA LINE AS

WELL AS FAVORABLE EXPERIENCE FROM ACCIDENT YEAR 2007 FOR ALLIED COVERAGES DUE TO LESS THAN EXPECTED CLAIM ACTIVITY.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INCLUDED $2.90 BILLION AND

$3.15 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS, NET OF REINSURANCE.

IT

IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS DUE TO THE VAGARIES OF COURT COVERAGE DECISIONS, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, THE

RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE WHICH ARE SET FORTH BELOW.

ASBESTOS RESERVES.

BECAUSE EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE

EXPOSURE PRESENTED

BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AT LEAST ANNUALLY. AMONG THE FACTORS WHICH THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER IN THE COURSE OF THIS REVIEW ARE: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE,

INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS

INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER

INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY,

INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM.

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IN-DEPTH ASBESTOS CLAIM REVIEW AND NOTED THE CONTINUATION OF RECENT TRENDS, WHICH

INCLUDE.



CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY INVOLVING INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS ASBESTOS-RELATED ILLNESS;



STABLE PAYMENT PATTERNS FOR A LARGE PROPORTION OF POLICYHOLDERS;



A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE ASBESTOS EXPOSURES CONFRONTING THE COMPANY DUE TO ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY;



CONTINUED MODERATE LEVEL OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCY ACTIVITY; AND



THE ABSENCE OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR NEW CLASSES OF DEFENDANTS.

WHILE

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE TRENDS INDICATE A REDUCTION IN THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S OVERALL ASBESTOS EXPOSURE, THERE NONETHELESS REMAINS A HIGH DEGREE OF

UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE FROM ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

THE

COMPANY'S QUARTERLY ASBESTOS RESERVE REVIEW INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANALYZES DEVELOPING PAYMENT PATTERNS AMONG POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE, FIELD OFFICE AND ASSUMED REINSURANCE AND OTHER

CATEGORIES AS WELL AS PROJECTED REINSURANCE BILLINGS AND RECOVERIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE,

YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO

ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES NOR HAVE THE COMPANY'S EVALUATIONS RESULTED IN ANY WAY OF DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY PAYMENT.

AS

IN PRIOR YEARS, THE ANNUAL CLAIM REVIEW CONSIDERED ACTIVE POLICYHOLDERS AND LITIGATION CASES FOR POTENTIAL PRODUCT AND "NON-PRODUCT" LIABILITY. COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR PERIOD, THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE CATEGORIES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICYHOLDERS WITH ACTIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS, EXPERIENCED AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS WHO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WERE TENDERING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. HOWEVER, GROSS DEFENSE AND INDEMNITY COSTS IN THESE CATEGORIES REMAINED AT SIMILAR LEVELS TO WHAT THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED IN

RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WHERE INDIVIDUALS ALLEGING SERIOUS ASBESTOS-RELATED INJURY CONTINUE TO TARGET PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL

DEFENDANTS.

NET

ASBESTOS LOSSES PAID IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WERE $350 MILLION, $341 MILLION AND $658 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. (ASBESTOS PAYMENTS IN 2008 INCLUDED THE COMPANY'S

ONE-TIME NET PAYMENT OF $365 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ACANDS, INC. MATTER). APPROXIMATELY 32%, 41% AND 59% OF TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES IN 2010, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANY'S LIABILITY.

THE

COMPANY RECORDED A NET $140 MILLION INCREASE IN THE COMPANY'S ASBESTOS RESERVES IN 2010, DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF 1) PROJECTED SETTLEMENT AND

DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO A BROAD NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS; 2) COSTS OF LITIGATING ASBESTOS-RELATED COVERAGE MATTERS; AND 3) PROJECTED PAYMENTS ON ASSUMED REINSURANCE ACCOUNTS. THIS

INCREASE INCLUDED A $70 MILLION BENEFIT FROM THE REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RESULTING FROM A RECENT FAVORABLE RULING RELATED TO A REINSURANCE DISPUTE, AND AN

INCREASE IN ESTIMATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. IN 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $185 MILLION INCREASE IN ASBESTOS RESERVES, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE COMPANY'S ASSUMPTION FOR

PROJECTED DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO MANY POLICYHOLDERS. THE COMPANY RECORDED A $70 MILLION INCREASE TO ASBESTOS RESERVES IN 2008, WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY A CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH LITIGATING ASBESTOS COVERAGE MATTERS AND A CHANGE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDERS. OVERALL, THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF THE UNDERLYING ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT DID NOT CHANGE

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM RECENT PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

IN ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND

THE ANTICIPATED

COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF

SIMILAR EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE ALLEGATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM

AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF

GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE

ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF

COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION.

CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES.

ALTHOUGH

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE NOTICES FROM POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE NUMBER OF NEW POLICYHOLDERS SUBMITTING THOSE NOTICES DECLINED FROM 2009.

THESE POLICYHOLDERS CONTINUE TO PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE LOWER TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, IN MANY INSTANCES CLEAN-UP COSTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE REGULATORY

AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT RISK-BASED SITE ANALYSES AND MORE EFFICIENT CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED MODEST UPWARD DEVELOPMENT IN THE EXPECTED

DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PENDING POLICYHOLDERS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $35 MILLION IN 2010. THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS NET

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $70 MILLION IN 2009, DUE TO A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND UPWARD DEVELOPMENT IN THE EXPECTED DEFENSE AND

SETTLEMENT COSTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PENDING POLICYHOLDERS. IN 2008, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $85 MILLION AS A RESULT OF UPWARD DEVELOPMENT IN THE ANTICIPATED DEFENSE

AND SETTLEMENT COSTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PENDING POLICYHOLDERS.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES

CARRIED FOR

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE

FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT

TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION,

ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE COST TO RESOLVE AND/OR THE NUMBER OF ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY

UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER

INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RECOVER

REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE

INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS. IN ADDITION, UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE

LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY

DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO LEGISLATIVE AND/OR JUDICIAL REFORMS ESTABLISHING MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR THE PURSUIT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN

APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR,

FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND

REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE

THE COMPANY HAS GEOGRAPHIC EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BY A VARIETY OF EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

HURRICANES, EARTHQUAKES, WINDSTORMS, HAIL, WILDFIRES, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, FLOODS AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO RESULT FROM A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR,

BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS) OR AS A CONSEQUENCE OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A

CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS;

HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE

THAT

ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO MITIGATE ITS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE.

THERE

ARE ALSO RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY OF THE

COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION

AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION

EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS INCOME INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE

COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING

PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

2010 DEBT PAYMENTS AND MATURITIES

PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 2010, THE COMPANY WAS SUBJECT TO A REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT THAT IT HAD GRANTED TO THE HOLDERS

OF ITS 6.75% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 20, 2036 (THE SENIOR NOTES). THE REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT RESTRICTED THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO REPURCHASE ITS $1.00 BILLION IN OUTSTANDING 6.25%

FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE MARCH 15, 2067 (THE DEBENTURES). IN NOVEMBER 2010, THE COMPANY PAID APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION TO HOLDERS

OF THE SENIOR NOTES TO TERMINATE THE REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT. FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION, THE COMPANY PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY $885 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBENTURES. A

$60 MILLION PRETAX LOSS WAS RECOGNIZED IN 2010 RELATED TO THESE TRANSACTIONS.

ON

SEPTEMBER 16, 2010, THE COMPANY REPAID THE REMAINING $4 MILLION PRINCIPAL BALANCE ON ITS 7.81% PRIVATE PLACEMENT SENIOR NOTES. ON AUGUST 23, 2010, THE COMPANY'S

JUNE 2, 2019. THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE ISSUANCE, AFTER ORIGINAL ISSUANCE DISCOUNT AND THE DEDUCTION OF UNDERWRITING EXPENSES AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY

$494 MILLION. INTEREST ON THE SENIOR NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON JUNE 2 AND DECEMBER 2 OF EACH YEAR. THE SENIOR NOTES ARE REDEEMABLE IN WHOLE AT ANY

TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF (A) 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR (B) THE SUM

OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED (EXCLUSIVE OF INTEREST ACCRUED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION) DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE

SEPTEMBER 15.

FROM AND INCLUDING MARCH 15, 2017, THE DEBENTURES WILL BEAR INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 2.215%, PAYABLE QUARTERLY ON MARCH 15,

JUNE 15, SEPTEMBER 15 AND DECEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2017 AT A

REDEMPTION PRICE OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT BEING REDEEMED PLUS ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2017 (A) IN WHOLE

AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME OR (B) IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN TAX OR RATING AGENCY EVENTS RELATING TO THE DEBENTURES, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO THE

GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT BEING REDEEMED AND THE APPLICABLE MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT, IN EACH CASE PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST.

THE

COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT, ON ONE OR MORE OCCASIONS, TO DEFER THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE DEBENTURES. THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE DEFERRED INTEREST UNTIL IT HAS

DEFERRED INTEREST FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OR, IF EARLIER, MADE A PAYMENT OF CURRENT INTEREST DURING A DEFERRAL PERIOD. THE COMPANY MAY DEFER INTEREST FOR UP TO TEN CONSECUTIVE YEARS WITHOUT GIVING

RISE TO AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. DEFERRED INTEREST WILL ACCUMULATE ADDITIONAL INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE EQUAL TO THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE THEN APPLICABLE TO THE DEBENTURES.

THE

DEBENTURES HAVE A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 15, 2067 AND A SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 15, 2037. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION ANY TIME

(AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) USING ANY SOURCE OF FUNDS, INCLUDING CASH. IF THE COMPANY CHOOSES NOT TO REDEEM THE DEBENTURES, THEN DURING THE 180-DAY PERIOD ENDING NOT MORE THAN 15 AND NOT LESS

THAN TEN BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO SELL ENOUGH QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES TO PERMIT REPAYMENT OF THE

DEBENTURES AT THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE. IF ANY DEBENTURES REMAIN OUTSTANDING AFTER THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, UNLESS AND UNTIL THE COMPANY REDEEMS THE DEBENTURES (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) USING ANY

SOURCE OF FUNDS, INCLUDING CASH, THE COMPANY SHALL BE REQUIRED TO USE ITS COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO RAISE SUFFICIENT PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF QUALIFYING CAPITAL

SECURITIES TO PERMIT THE REPAYMENT IN FULL OF THE DEBENTURES. IF THERE ARE REMAINING DEBENTURES AT THE FINAL MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO REDEEM THE DEBENTURES USING ANY SOURCE OF FUNDS.

QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES ARE SECURITIES (OTHER THAN COMMON STOCK, QUALIFYING WARRANTS, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON EQUITY, AND DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR

PREFERRED EQUITY) WHICH GENERALLY ARE TREATED BY THE RATINGS AGENCIES AS HAVING SIMILAR EQUITY CONTENT TO THE DEBENTURES.

COMPANY'S THREE OTHER JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALL SIMILAR IN NATURE TO EACH OTHER. THREE SEPARATE BUSINESS TRUSTS ISSUED PREFERRED SECURITIES TO INVESTORS AND

USED THE PROCEEDS TO

PURCHASE THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES. INTEREST ON EACH OF THE INSTRUMENTS IS PAID SEMI-ANNUALLY.

THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDES THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, WHICH WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE RESULTING FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING THE EFFECTIVE-INTEREST METHOD. THE AMORTIZATION OF THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT REDUCED INTEREST EXPENSE BY

$4 MILLION AND $11 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT

ON JUNE 10, 2010, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A

SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, REPLACING ITS FIVE-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT EXPIRED ON THAT DATE. PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT COVENANTS, THE COMPANY MUST

MAINTAIN A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH (GENERALLY DEFINED AS SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY PLUS CERTAIN TRUST PREFERRED AND MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES, REDUCED FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS) OF $14.35 BILLION. THE COMPANY MUST ALSO MAINTAIN A RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO THE SUM OF TOTAL DEBT PLUS CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OF NOT GREATER THAN 0.40 TO 1.00. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT

AGREEMENT CONTAINS OTHER CUSTOMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO A CHANGE IN CONTROL, WHICH IS DEFINED TO INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF

35% OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S VOTING STOCK AND CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS.

GENERALLY, THE COST OF BORROWING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL RANGE FROM LIBOR PLUS 100

BASIS POINTS TO LIBOR PLUS 175 BASIS POINTS DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THAT COST WOULD HAVE BEEN LIBOR PLUS 125 BASIS POINTS HAD THERE BEEN ANY AMOUNTS

OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THIS LINE OF CREDIT ALSO SUPPORTS THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.

SHELF REGISTRATION

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE

POTENTIAL OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES. THE COMPANY MAY OFFER THESE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF OFFERING. DURING 2010 AND 2009, THE

COMPANY ISSUED SECURITIES WITH A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1.25 BILLION AND $500 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

PREFERRED STOCK

THE COMPANY'S PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY REPRESENTS THE PAR VALUE OF PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING RELATED TO A LEGACY STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP) TRUST WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MERGED INTO THE TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE SAVINGS PLAN). THE SOP TRUST MAY AT ANY TIME CONVERT ANY OR ALL OF THE PREFERRED SHARES INTO SHARES

OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AT A RATE OF EIGHT SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR EACH PREFERRED SHARE. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS RESERVED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO SATISFY THE

CONVERSION OF ALL PREFERRED SHARES ISSUED TO THE SOP TRUST AND THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES TO MEET EMPLOYEE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. UPON THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES, THE COMPANY WILL

ISSUE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO THE TRUST TO FULFILL THE REDEMPTION OBLIGATIONS. HOLDERS OF THE PREFERRED STOCK HAVE A PREFERENCE UPON LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP OF THE COMPANY OF $100 PER

SHARE.

COMMON STOCK

THE COMPANY IS GOVERNED BY THE MINNESOTA BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT. ALL AUTHORIZED SHARES OF VOTING COMMON STOCK HAVE NO PAR VALUE.

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REACQUIRED ARE CONSIDERED AUTHORIZED AND UNISSUED SHARES. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF THE COMPANY IS 1.75 BILLION, CONSISTING OF 1.745 BILLION SHARES OF

VOTING COMMON STOCK AND FIVE MILLION UNDESIGNATED SHARES. THE COMPANY'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION ALLOW THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ESTABLISH, FROM THE UNDESIGNATED SHARES, ONE OR MORE CLASSES AND

SERIES OF SHARES, AND TO FURTHER DESIGNATE THE TYPE OF SHARES AND TERMS THEREOF. IN 1990, THE BOARD DESIGNATED 1.45 MILLION SHARES AS SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK IN CONNECTION

WITH ITS SAVINGS PLAN.

TREASURY STOCK

THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATIONS UNDER WHICH REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO

TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET, PURSUANT TO PRE-SET TRADING PLANS MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 10B5-1 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS OR

OTHERWISE. THE AUTHORIZATIONS DO NOT HAVE A STATED EXPIRATION DATE. THE TIMING AND ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL POSITION, EARNINGS, CATASTROPHE LOSSES, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, OTHER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS), MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES REPURCHASE ACTIVITY IN 2010 AND REMAINING REPURCHASE CAPACITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

IN

JANUARY 2011, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION THAT ADDED AN ADDITIONAL $5 BILLION OF REPURCHASE CAPACITY TO THE $1.51 BILLION OF

CAPACITY REMAINING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

THE

COMPANY'S AMENDED AND RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN PROVIDES SETTLEMENT ALTERNATIVES TO EMPLOYEES IN WHICH THE COMPANY REPURCHASES SHARES TO COVER TAX WITHHOLDING COSTS AND

EXERCISE COSTS. DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY PURCHASED $66 MILLION AND $65 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THESE PLANS.

COMMON

SHARES ACQUIRED ARE REPORTED AS TREASURY STOCK IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS

AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. A MAXIMUM OF $3.61 BILLION IS AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2011 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS WITHOUT PRIOR

APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE TO ACCELERATE THE TIMING WITHIN 2011 AND/OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2011, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN CERTAIN DIVIDENDS BEING SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. THE HOLDING COMPANY RECEIVED $6.59 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS DOMESTIC INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES IN 2010, INCLUDING $5.26 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS THAT WERE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPANY'S REQUEST FOR THE ACCELERATED TIMING OF PAYMENT.

STATUTORY NET INCOME AND SURPLUS

STATUTORY NET INCOME OF THE COMPANY'S DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WAS $3.69 BILLION, $3.90 BILLION

AND $4.10 BILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS OF THE COMPANY'S DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WAS

$20.07 BILLION AND $23.20 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE WAS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. THE COMPUTATION

OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE REFLECTED THE EFFECT OF POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES.

ON

JANUARY 1, 2009, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE UPDATED GUIDANCE RELATED TO EARNINGS PER SHARE AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1. THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE WAS A

FOR

U.S.

INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON $503 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS' UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, AS SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED

12. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS A SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN, THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN), WHICH REPLACED

PRIOR SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS (LEGACY PLANS). THE PURPOSES OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN ARE TO ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY'S NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES WITH THOSE OF THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS, AND TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN PERSONNEL BY PROVIDING INCENTIVES IN THE FORM OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN PERMITS

GRANTS OF NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND OTHER

STOCK-BASED OR STOCK-DENOMINATED AWARDS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZED FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN IS

35 MILLION SHARES, SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY OF ISSUING NEW SHARES TO SETTLE THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTION AWARDS

AND THE VESTING OF OTHER EQUITY AWARDS.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, LEGACY SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS WERE TERMINATED. OUTSTANDING GRANTS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE TERMINATION OF

THESE LEGACY PLANS, INCLUDING THE GRANT OF RELOAD OPTIONS RELATED TO PRIOR OPTION GRANTS UNDER THE LEGACY PLANS. ALL OUTSTANDING OPTIONS WITH A RELOAD FEATURE EXPIRE IN 2013.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

12. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)

THE

2004 INCENTIVE PLAN IS THE ONLY PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED. IN ADDITION TO THE 35 MILLION SHARES INITIALLY AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER

THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE COUNTED TOWARDS THE 35 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN: (I) SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO AN AWARD THAT EXPIRES UNEXERCISED, THAT IS FORFEITED, TERMINATED OR CANCELED, THAT IS SETTLED IN CASH OR OTHER FORMS OF PROPERTY, OR OTHERWISE DOES NOT RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE

OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, IN WHOLE OR IN PART; (II) SHARES THAT ARE USED TO PAY THE EXERCISE PRICE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SHARES USED TO PAY WITHHOLDING TAXES ON

AWARDS GENERALLY; AND (III) SHARES PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ON THE OPEN MARKET USING CASH OPTION EXERCISE PROCEEDS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

AVAILABLE FOR GRANT PURSUANT TO SUCH MARKET PURCHASES SHALL NOT BE GREATER THAN THE NUMBER THAT COULD BE REPURCHASED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF EXERCISE OF THE STOCK OPTION GIVING RISE TO

SUCH OPTION PROCEEDS. THESE PROVISIONS ALSO APPLY TO AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE LEGACY SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS A COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS (THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM). UNDER THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM, NON-EMPLOYEE

DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION CONSISTS OF AN ANNUAL RETAINER, A DEFERRED STOCK AWARD, COMMITTEE CHAIR FEES AND A LEAD DIRECTOR FEE. EACH NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR MAY CHOOSE TO RECEIVE ALL OR A

PORTION OF HIS OR HER ANNUAL RETAINER IN THE FORM OF CASH OR DEFERRED STOCK UNITS WHICH VEST UPON GRANT. THE ANNUAL DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS VEST IN FULL ON THE DATE OF THE ONE-YEAR

ANNIVERSARY OF THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY OCCURRING IN THE YEAR OF THE AWARD, SUBJECT TO CONTINUED SERVICE. ANY OF THE DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS MAY ACCUMULATE, INCLUDING

REINVESTMENT DIVIDENDS, UNTIL DISTRIBUTION EITHER IN A LUMP SUM SIX MONTHS AFTER TERMINATION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR OR, IF THE DIRECTOR SO ELECTS, IN ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS BEGINNING AT LEAST SIX

MONTHS FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR. THE SHARES OF DEFERRED STOCK UNITS ISSUED UNDER THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM ARE AWARDED UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN.

STOCK OPTION AWARDS

STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES HAVE A TEN-YEAR TERM. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2007,

STOCK OPTIONS WERE GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY PRECEDING THE DATE OF GRANT. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2007, ALL STOCK

OPTIONS ARE GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED GENERALLY VEST UPON MEETING CERTAIN YEARS OF SERVICE

CRITERIA. EXCEPT AS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD MAY ALLOW IN THE FUTURE, STOCK OPTIONS CANNOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY THE PARTICIPANT. THE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE

PLAN VEST AT THE END OF THREE YEARS (CLIFF VEST).

IN

ADDITION TO THE STOCK OPTION AWARDS DESCRIBED ABOVE, CERTAIN STOCK OPTION AWARDS THAT WERE GRANTED UNDER LEGACY PLANS PERMIT AN EMPLOYEE EXERCISING AN OPTION TO BE GRANTED A NEW

OPTION (A RELOAD OPTION) AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE ON WHICH THE ORIGINAL OPTION IS EXERCISED. THE RELOAD OPTION IS PERMITTED ON CERTAIN

STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2003 AT AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMMON STOCK USED TO SATISFY BOTH THE EXERCISE PRICE AND WITHHOLDING TAXES DUE UPON EXERCISE OF AN

OPTION AND VEST EITHER SIX MONTHS OR ONE YEAR AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED ORIGINAL OPTION.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

12. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)

THE

FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT BY APPLICATION OF A VARIATION OF THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL USING THE ASSUMPTIONS NOTED IN THE FOLLOWING

TABLE. THE EXPECTED TERM OF NEWLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS IS THE TIME TO VEST PLUS HALF THE REMAINING TIME TO EXPIRATION. THIS CONSIDERS THE VESTING RESTRICTION AND REPRESENTS AN EVEN PATTERN OF

EXERCISE BEHAVIOR

OVER THE REMAINING TERM. RELOAD OPTIONS ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE ORIGINAL OPTION AND THEREFORE WOULD GENERALLY HAVE A SHORTER EXPECTED TERM. BEGINNING IN APRIL 2010, DUE TO THE

COMPANY HAVING ATTAINED SUFFICIENT HISTORY WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES IN ITS STOCK PRICES OVER TIME, THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK

FOR THE SAME PERIOD AS THE ESTIMATED OPTION TERM BASED ON THE MID-MONTH OF THE OPTION GRANT. PRIOR TO APRIL 2010, THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY WAS BASED ON THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF

THE COMMON STOCK OF AN INDUSTRY PEER GROUP OF ENTITIES DUE TO THE LIMITED COMPANY STOCK HISTORY. THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S CURRENT QUARTER DIVIDEND ANNUALIZED AND ASSUMED TO BE

CONSTANT OVER THE EXPECTED OPTION TERM. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE FOR EACH OPTION IS THE INTERPOLATED MARKET YIELD FOR THE MID-MONTH OF THE OPTION GRANT ON A U.S. TREASURY

BILL WITH A TERM COMPARABLE TO THE EXPECTED OPTION TERM OF THE GRANTED STOCK OPTION. SHARES RECEIVED THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES UNDER THE RELOAD PROGRAM ARE SUBJECT TO EITHER A ONE-YEAR OR

TWO-YEAR RESTRICTION ON SALE. A DISCOUNT, AS MEASURED BY THE ESTIMATED COST OF PROTECTING AGAINST CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, 5% FOR ONE YEAR SALES RESTRICTIONS AND 10% FOR TWO YEAR SALES

RESTRICTIONS, HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF RELOAD OPTIONS GRANTED TO REFLECT THESE SALES RESTRICTIONS. THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS ON GRANT

DATE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008.

RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD PROGRAMS

THE COMPANY, COMMENCING WITH EQUITY GRANTS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, ISSUES RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS

AND KEY EMPLOYEES UNDER THE EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN. A RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT REPRESENTS THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. THESE RESTRICTED

STOCK UNIT AWARDS ARE GRANTED AT MARKET PRICE, GENERALLY VEST THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, DO NOT HAVE VOTING RIGHTS AND THE UNDERLYING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE NOT ISSUED UNTIL THE VESTING

CRITERIA IS SATISFIED.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS A PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS PROGRAM PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE BEGINNING IN 2006. UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE PERFORMANCE

SHARE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF VICE PRESIDENT (OR ITS EQUIVALENT) OR ABOVE. THE PERFORMANCE AWARDS PROVIDE THE RECIPIENT THE RIGHT TO EARN SHARES OF THE

COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ATTAINMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE GOALS. THE PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR PERFORMANCE AWARDS ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ADJUSTED RETURN ON EQUITY OVER A

THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. VESTING OF ANY PERFORMANCE SHARES IS CONTINGENT UPON THE COMPANY ATTAINING THE RELEVANT PERFORMANCE PERIOD MINIMUM THRESHOLD RETURN ON EQUITY. IF THE

PERFORMANCE PERIOD RETURN ON EQUITY IS BELOW THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD, NONE OF THE SHARES WILL VEST. IF PERFORMANCE MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE THRESHOLD, A RANGE OF PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL

VEST (50%160% FOR AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO AND INCLUDING FEBRUARY 2009; 50%150% FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN FEBRUARY 2010; AND 50%130% FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN FEBRUARY

2011), DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL RETURN ON EQUITY ATTAINED.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARES IS MEASURED AT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY STOCK AT DATE OF GRANT.

THE

TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF SHARES THAT VESTED DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS $113 MILLION, $78 MILLION AND $82 MILLION,

ON

FEBRUARY 1, 2011, THE COMPANY, UNDER THE 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, GRANTED 1,662,334 COMMON STOCK AWARDS IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE

SHARE AWARDS TO PARTICIPATING OFFICERS, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS TOTALED 929,157 SHARES WHILE THE PERFORMANCE

SHARE AWARDS TOTALED 733,177 SHARES. THE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMMON STOCK AWARDS ON THE DATE OF GRANT WAS $56.81.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST RECOGNITION

THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A SERVICE CONDITION IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED AND IS

RECOGNIZED OVER THE TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH SERVICE IS TO BE PROVIDED (REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD). AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREE-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OR TO EMPLOYEES WHO BECOME RETIREE-ELIGIBLE BEFORE AN

AWARD'S VESTING DATE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE MET THE REQUISITE SERVICE CONDITION. THE COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A PERFORMANCE CONDITION IS BASED UPON THE PROBABLE OUTCOME OF THE

PERFORMANCE CONDITION, WHICH ON THE GRANT DATE REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF ATTAINING 100% OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED. THE COMPENSATION COST REFLECTS AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL FORFEITURE RATE FROM 3.5% TO

5% OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARDS. THAT ESTIMATE IS REVISED IF SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS EXPECTED TO VEST IS LIKELY TO DIFFER FROM

PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. COMPENSATION COSTS FOR AWARDS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. FOR AWARDS THAT HAVE A GRADED VESTING SCHEDULE, THE

COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD FOR EACH SEPARATE VESTING PORTION OF THE AWARD AS IF THE AWARD WAS, IN SUBSTANCE, MULTIPLE

AWARDS. THE TOTAL COMPENSATION COST FOR ALL SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS $128 MILLION,

$127 MILLION AND $123 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS ARE COMPENSATION COST ADJUSTMENTS OF $10 MILLION, $11 MILLION AND $6 MILLION, FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, THAT REFLECTED THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPDATED ESTIMATE OF PERFORMANCE SHARES DUE TO ATTAINING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE LEVELS FROM THE

DATE OF THE INITIAL GRANT OF THE PERFORMANCE AWARDS. THE RELATED TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WERE $44 MILLION, $44 MILLION AND $42 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THERE WAS $112 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO ALL NONVESTED SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS. THIS INCLUDES STOCK

OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANY'S 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN. THE UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST IS EXPECTED TO BE

RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.7 YEARS.

CASH

RECEIVED FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS UNDER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS TOTALED $408 MILLION AND $180 MILLION IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX

BENEFIT REALIZED FOR TAX DEDUCTIONS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2010 AND 2009 TOTALED $28 MILLION AND $17 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION USED TO DETERMINE THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR 2010 AND 2009 WAS BASED ON A YIELD-CURVE APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH, A WEIGHTED AVERAGE YIELD IS DETERMINED

FROM A HYPOTHETICAL PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED MATURITY CORPORATE BONDS (RATED AA OR HIGHER) AVAILABLE AT THE YEAR-END VALUATION DATE FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH OUTFLOWS

CORRESPOND WITH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYOUTS OF THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT PLAN.

IN

CHOOSING THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY'S PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL RETURNS OF EQUITY AND FIXED

MATURITY MARKETS IN CONJUNCTION WITH TODAY'S ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

AS

AN INDICATOR OF SENSITIVITY, INCREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $25 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010.

DECREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY

1% WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 BY $21 MILLION AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010.

PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF THE PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES AND ARE INTENDED, OVER TIME, TO

SATISFY THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PLAN. RISK TOLERANCE IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH CONSIDERATION OF PLAN LIABILITIES, PLAN FUNDED STATUS, AND CORPORATE FINANCIAL POSITION. THE ASSET MIX GUIDELINES

HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO SERVE AS TOOLS TO FACILITATE THE INVESTMENT OF PLAN ASSETS TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM TOTAL RETURN AND THE

ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF THE PLAN'S INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. INVESTMENT RISK IS MEASURED AND MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS THROUGH DAILY AND MONTHLY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REVIEWS, ANNUAL LIABILITY

MEASUREMENTS, AND PERIODIC ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES.

THE

COMPANY'S OVERALL INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO ACHIEVE A MIX OF APPROXIMATELY 85% TO 90% OF INVESTMENTS FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND 10% TO 15% FOR NEAR-TERM BENEFIT

PAYMENTS WITH A WIDE

DIVERSIFICATION

OF ASSET TYPES, FUND STRATEGIES AND FUND MANAGERS. THE CURRENT TARGET ALLOCATIONS FOR PLAN ASSETS ARE 55% TO 65% EQUITY SECURITIES AND 20% TO 40% FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. EQUITY

SECURITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN LARGE, MEDIUM AND SMALL-CAP COMPANIES PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES INCLUDE CORPORATE BONDS OF COMPANIES FROM

DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE A HEDGE FUND AND TWO PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS THAT

FOLLOW SEVERAL DIFFERENT STRATEGIES.

EQUITY

SECURITIES INCLUDED 797,600 SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK WITH A MARKET VALUE OF $44 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. ON JANUARY 28, 2011, THE COMPANY

PURCHASED THESE SHARES FROM THE PENSION PLAN UNDER THE COMPANY'S SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION FOR A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $45 MILLION, THE MARKET VALUE ON THAT DATE.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTPENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ASSETS

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE METHODS EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTED ASSETS, SEE NOTE 4. THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ASSETS.

FOR

THE EQUITY AND BOND MUTUAL FUNDS, THE PLAN RECEIVES PRICES FROM AN EXTERNAL PRICING SERVICE THAT ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET TRANSACTIONS, AND INCLUDES THESE ESTIMATES IN

LEVEL 1.

SHORT-TERM

SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WHICH APPROXIMATES COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST OR AMORTIZED DISCOUNT. THE FAIR VALUE OR MARKET VALUE OF THESE IS PERIODICALLY

COMPARED TO THIS AMORTIZED COST AND IS BASED ON SIGNIFICANT OBSERVABLE INPUTS AS DETERMINED BY AN EXTERNAL PRICING SERVICE. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH SHORT-TERM

SECURITIES, OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS, PROVIDED BY AN EXTERNAL PRICING SERVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS IS INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 AS THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON UNADJUSTED MARKET PRICES.

THE

PLAN HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN A HEDGE FUND AND TWO PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, WITH THEIR FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES DETERMINED BY AN EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER BASED ON RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING

RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTALS. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN THESE VALUATIONS, THE PLAN INCLUDES THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE

ESTIMATE FOR THE PARTNERSHIPS IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 3.

AND FUND MANAGERS. THE CURRENT TARGET ALLOCATIONS FOR PLAN ASSETS ARE 0% TO 10% EQUITY SECURITIES AND 20% TO 60% FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER ALLOCATED TO SHORT-TERM

SECURITIES. EQUITY SECURITIES INCLUDE AN INVESTMENT IN A SMALL-MID GROWTH FUND INVESTING IN COMPANIES PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES INCLUDE CORPORATE

SAVINGS PLAN

THE COMPANY HAS A SAVINGS PLAN, THE TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE SAVINGS PLAN), IN WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMPANY EMPLOYEES ARE

ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. UNDER THE SAVINGS PLAN, THE COMPANY MATCHES EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 5% OF ELIGIBLE PAY, WITH A MAXIMUM ANNUAL MATCH OF $5,000 WHICH BECOMES 100% VESTED AFTER THREE YEARS

OF SERVICE. THE COMPANY'S MATCHING CONTRIBUTION IS MADE IN CASH AND INVESTED ACCORDING TO THE EMPLOYEE'S CURRENT INVESTMENT ELECTIONS. THE COMPANY'S MATCHING CONTRIBUTION CAN BE REINVESTED AT ANY TIME

INTO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT OPTION. IN 2009, IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL MATCHING CONTRIBUTION, THE COMPANY MADE A SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION TO EACH EMPLOYEE HAVING A BASE SALARY OF $60,000 OR LESS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, IN THE AMOUNT OF 1% OF BASE SALARY UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $500 REGARDLESS OF THE EMPLOYEE HAVING

CONTRIBUTED TO THE SAVINGS PLAN. THE TOTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO THE SAVINGS PLAN WAS $93 MILLION AND $98 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

INCLUDED

IN THE SAVINGS PLAN ARE A LEGACY SAVINGS PLUS PLAN (SPP) AND A STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP) IN WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES WHO WERE HIRED BY LEGACY SPC BEFORE

APRIL 1, 2004 WERE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN 2004 UNDER THE SPP, THE COMPANY MATCHED 100% OF EMPLOYEES' CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 6% OF THEIR SALARY. THE MATCH WAS IN THE FORM OF

PREFERRED SHARES, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE IN THE SOP, OR IN THE COMPANY'S COMMON SHARES. ALSO ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS WERE PREFERRED SHARES EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF DIVIDENDS ON PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED

SHARES. EACH SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK PAYS A DIVIDEND OF $11.72 ANNUALLY AND IS CURRENTLY CONVERTIBLE INTO EIGHT SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE SOP HAS NO PREFERRED SHARES AVAILABLE FOR

FUTURE ALLOCATIONS.

ALL

COMMON SHARES AND THE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENT OF ALL PREFERRED SHARES HELD BY THE SAVINGS PLAN ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR DILUTED EPS COMPUTATIONS AND DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALL

SHARES ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

CONTINGENCIES

THIS SECTION DESCRIBES THE MAJOR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS, TO WHICH

THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS A PARTY OR TO WHICH ANY OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTIES IS SUBJECT.

ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED PROCEEDINGS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY RECEIVES CLAIMS FOR INSURANCE ARISING UNDER POLICIES ISSUED BY THE

COMPANY ASSERTING ALLEGED INJURIES AND DAMAGES FROM ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED EXPOSURES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LITIGATION DESCRIBED

BELOW. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED LITIGATION. THE COMPANY IS DEFENDING ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES OF THESE DISPUTES ARE UNCERTAIN. IN THIS REGARD, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE, INCLUDING SETTLING LITIGATION UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES.

ASBESTOS DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION

IN OCTOBER 2001 AND APRIL 2002, TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS (

WISE V.

TRAVELERS

AND

MENINGER V. TRAVELERS

) WERE FILED AGAINST TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC) AND OTHER INSURERS (NOT

INCLUDING THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. (SPC)) IN STATE COURT IN WEST VIRGINIA. THESE AND OTHER CASES SUBSEQUENTLY FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE PROCEEDING IN THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE INSURER DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES IN VIOLATION OF STATE STATUTES BY INAPPROPRIATELY HANDLING AND

SETTLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO REOPEN LARGE NUMBERS OF SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, DIRECTLY ON INSURERS. SIMILAR LAWSUITS

ALLEGING INAPPROPRIATE HANDLING AND SETTLING OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS WERE FILED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND HAWAII STATE COURTS. THESE SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS.

IN

MARCH 2002, THE PLAINTIFFS IN CONSOLIDATED ASBESTOS ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE A MASS TORT PANEL OF JUDGES IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT AMENDED THEIR COMPLAINT TO INCLUDE TPC AS A

DEFENDANT, ALLEGING THAT TPC AND OTHER INSURERS BREACHED ALLEGED DUTIES TO CERTAIN USERS OF ASBESTOS PRODUCTS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF

AND RAISING SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS, PRIMARILY VIOLATIONS OF PURPORTED COMMON LAW DUTIES TO THIRD PARTIES, HAVE ALSO BEEN ASSERTED IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS AGAINST TPC AND SPC. THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THESE

SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS.

THE

FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT HAD PRESIDED OVER THE BANKRUPTCY OF TPC'S FORMER POLICYHOLDER JOHNS-MANVILLE CORPORATION ISSUED A TEMPORARY INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE PROSECUTION OF

THE STATUTORY ACTIONS (BUT NOT THE HAWAII ACTIONS), THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS AND AN ADDITIONAL SET OF CASES FILED IN

233

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

15. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (CONTINUED)

VARIOUS

STATE COURTS IN TEXAS AND OHIO, AND ENJOINING CERTAIN ATTORNEYS FROM FILING ANY FURTHER LAWSUITS AGAINST TPC BASED ON SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE INJUNCTION, ADDITIONAL COMMON LAW

CLAIMS WERE FILED AGAINST TPC.

IN

NOVEMBER 2003, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS. THIS SETTLEMENT INCLUDES A LUMP-SUM PAYMENT OF UP TO $412 MILLION BY TPC,

SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. IN MAY 2004, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT RESOLVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PENDING AND SIMILAR FUTURE COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC. THIS SETTLEMENT

REQUIRES A PAYMENT OF UP TO $90 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. AMONG THE CONTINGENCIES FOR EACH OF THESE SETTLEMENTS IS A FINAL ORDER OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

CLARIFYING THAT ALL OF THESE CLAIMS, AND SIMILAR FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, ARE BARRED BY PRIOR ORDERS ENTERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ("THE 1986 ORDERS").

ON

AUGUST 17, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED AN ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS AND CLARIFYING THAT THE 1986 ORDERS BARRED THE PENDING STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON LAW

CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST TPC ("THE CLARIFYING ORDER"). THE CLARIFYING ORDER ALSO APPLIES TO SIMILAR DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

ON

MARCH 29, 2006, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SUBSTANTIALLY AFFIRMED THE CLARIFYING ORDER WHILE VACATING THAT PORTION OF THE ORDER THAT REQUIRED

ALL FUTURE DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST TPC TO FIRST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT BEFORE PROCEEDING IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.

VARIOUS

PARTIES APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURT'S MARCH 29, 2006 RULING TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. ON FEBRUARY 15, 2008, THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED AN

OPINION VACATING ON JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS THE DISTRICT COURT'S APPROVAL OF THE CLARIFYING ORDER. ON FEBRUARY 29, 2008, TPC AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTIES TO THE APPEALS FILED PETITIONS FOR

REHEARING AND/OR REHEARING

EN BANC

, REQUESTING REINSTATEMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S JUDGMENT, WHICH WERE DENIED. TPC AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTIES FILED

PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SEEKING REVIEW OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S DECISION, AND ON DECEMBER 12, 2008, THE PETITIONS WERE GRANTED.

ON

JUNE 18, 2009, THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF TPC, REVERSING THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S FEBRUARY 15, 2008 DECISION, FINDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE 1986 ORDERS ARE

FINAL AND GENERALLY BAR THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC. FURTHER, THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT HAD JURISDICTION TO ISSUE THE

CLARIFYING ORDER. HOWEVER, SINCE THE SECOND CIRCUIT HAD NOT RULED ON CERTAIN ADDITIONAL ISSUES, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO PROCEDURAL MATTERS AND THE ADEQUACY OF NOTICE PROVIDED TO CERTAIN PARTIES, THE

SUPREME COURT REMANDED THE CASE TO THE SECOND CIRCUIT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS ON THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES. ON OCTOBER 21, 2009, ALL BUT ONE OF THE OBJECTORS TO THE CLARIFYING ORDER REQUESTED THAT

THE SECOND CIRCUIT DISMISS THEIR APPEAL OF THE ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT, AND THAT REQUEST WAS GRANTED.

ON

MARCH 22, 2010, THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED AN OPINION IN WHICH IT FOUND THAT THE NOTICE OF THE 1986 ORDERS PROVIDED TO THE REMAINING OBJECTOR WAS INSUFFICIENT TO BAR

CONTRIBUTION CLAIMS BY THAT OBJECTOR AGAINST TPC. ON APRIL 5, 2010, TPC FILED A PETITION FOR REHEARING AND REHEARING

EN BANC

WITH THE SECOND

CIRCUIT, REQUESTING FURTHER REVIEW OF ITS MARCH 22, 2010 OPINION, WHICH WAS DENIED ON MAY 25, 2010. ON AUGUST 18, 2010, TPC FILED A PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI IN THE UNITED

STATES SUPREME COURT SEEKING REVIEW OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S MARCH 22, 2010 OPINION, AND A PETITION FOR A WRIT OF MANDAMUS SEEKING AN ORDER FROM THE SUPREME COURT REQUIRING THE SECOND CIRCUIT TO

THE SUPREME COURT'S JUNE 18, 2009 RULING IN TPC'S FAVOR. THE SUPREME COURT DENIED THE PETITIONS ON NOVEMBER 29, 2010.

THE

PLAINTIFFS IN THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS ACTIONS FILED MOTIONS TO COMPEL WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2010 AND SEPTEMBER 3,

2010, RESPECTIVELY, ARGUING THAT ALL CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE SETTLEMENTS HAVE BEEN MET AND SEEKING TO REQUIRE TPC TO PAY THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS. ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2010, TPC FILED AN

OPPOSITION TO THE PLAINTIFFS' MOTIONS TO

COMPEL ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE SETTLEMENTS, PRINCIPALLY THE REQUIREMENT THAT ALL CONTRIBUTION CLAIMS BE BARRED, HAVE NOT BEEN MET IN LIGHT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S

MARCH 22, 2010 OPINION. ON DECEMBER 16, 2010, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT GRANTED THE PLAINTIFFS' MOTIONS AND RULED THAT TPC WAS REQUIRED TO FUND THE SETTLEMENTS. ON JANUARY 20, 2011,

THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS DECEMBER 16, 2010 RULING AND ORDERED TPC TO PAY THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS PLUS PREJUDGMENT INTEREST. ON JANUARY 21, 2011, TPC

FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FROM THE BANKRUPTCY COURT'S JANUARY 20, 2011 JUDGMENT.

SPC,

WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY COURT RULINGS OR THE SETTLEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IS A PARTY TO PENDING DIRECT ACTION CASES IN TEXAS STATE COURT ASSERTING COMMON LAW

CLAIMS. ALL SUCH CASES THAT ARE STILL PENDING AND IN WHICH SPC HAS BEEN SERVED ARE CURRENTLY ON THE INACTIVE DOCKET IN TEXAS STATE COURT. IF ANY OF THOSE CASES BECOMES ACTIVE, SPC INTENDS TO LITIGATE

THOSE CASES VIGOROUSLY. SPC WAS PREVIOUSLY A DEFENDANT IN SIMILAR DIRECT ACTIONS IN OHIO STATE COURT. THOSE ACTIONS HAVE ALL BEEN DISMISSED FOLLOWING FAVORABLE RULINGS BY OHIO TRIAL AND APPELLATE

COURTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, SPC AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN NAMED IN INDIVIDUAL DIRECT ACTIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

OUTCOME AND IMPACT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

CURRENTLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT LEGAL OUTCOMES AND

THEIR IMPACT ON

THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. ANY SUCH DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES

IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT

CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS

BROKER ANTI-TRUST LITIGATION

IN 2005, FOUR PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE BROUGHT AGAINST A NUMBER OF INSURANCE BROKERS AND INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY, BY PLAINTIFFS WHO ALLEGEDLY PURCHASED INSURANCE PRODUCTS THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE DEFENDANT BROKERS. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGED THAT VARIOUS INSURANCE BROKERS CONSPIRED WITH EACH

OTHER AND WITH VARIOUS INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE PREMIUMS, ALLOCATE BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS AND RIG BIDS FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS OFFERED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. TO THE EXTENT

THEY WERE NOT ORIGINALLY FILED THERE, THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTIONS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY AND WERE CONSOLIDATED FOR PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS

WITH OTHER CLASS ACTIONS UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

. ON AUGUST 1, 2005, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING THE

FOUR NAMED PLAINTIFFS IN THE ABOVE-REFERENCED CLASS ACTIONS, FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT NAMING VARIOUS BROKERS AND INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, ON BEHALF OF A PUTATIVE

NATIONWIDE CLASS OF POLICYHOLDERS. THE

235

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

COMPLAINT

INCLUDED CAUSES OF ACTION UNDER THE SHERMAN ACT, THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT (RICO), STATE COMMON LAW AND THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS STATES PROHIBITING ANTITRUST

VIOLATIONS. THE COMPLAINT SOUGHT MONETARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND TREBLED DAMAGES, PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, RESTITUTION, INCLUDING DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS, INTEREST AND COSTS,

INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES. ALL DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM. AFTER GIVING PLAINTIFFS MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPLEAD, THE COURT DISMISSED THE SHERMAN ACT

CLAIMS ON AUGUST 31, 2007 AND THE RICO CLAIMS ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2007, BOTH WITH PREJUDICE, AND DECLINED TO EXERCISE SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION OVER THE STATE LAW CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS

APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISIONS TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ON AUGUST 16, 2010, THE THIRD CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISTRICT COURT'S DISMISSAL OF ALL SHERMAN ACT AND

RICO CLAIMS AGAINST CERTAIN DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, EXCEPT FOR SHERMAN ACT AND RICO CLAIMS INVOLVING THE SALE OF EXCESS CASUALTY INSURANCE THROUGH ONE DEFENDANT BROKER, AS WELL AS ALL STATE

LAW CLAIMS, WHICH THEY REMANDED TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. ON OCTOBER 1, 2010, DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, FILED RENEWED MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE REMANDED CLAIMS. THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THESE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY.

ADDITIONAL

INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS AGAINST THE COMPANY INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN

IN RE INSURANCE

BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION,

AND FURTHER ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY.

OTHER

IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS, NOT INVOLVING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, ARISING

MOSTLY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS, EITHER AS A LIABILITY INSURER DEFENDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS OR AS AN INSURER DEFENDING CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST IT

RELATING TO COVERAGE OR THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN PROCEEDINGS ADDRESSING DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE COMPANY'S REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. WHILE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD BE MATERIAL TO

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, NONE WOULD LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OTHER COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

COMMITMENTS

INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS IN WHICH IT INVESTS.

THESE COMMITMENTS TOTALED $1.26 BILLION AND $1.32 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, IN NOVEMBER 2010, AN INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY

ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO COMMENCE A JOINT VENTURE WITH J. MALUCELLI PARTICIPAÇÕES EM SEGUROS E RESSEGUROS S.A, A BRAZILIAN COMPANY ("J. MALUCELLI"), THROUGH

THE ACQUISITION OF APPROXIMATELY 43% OF J. MALUCELLI'S COMMON STOCK. J. MALUCELLI IS CURRENTLY THE MARKET LEADER IN SURETY IN BRAZIL BASED ON MARKET SHARE. THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THIS ACQUISITION WILL

BE R$625 MILLION BRAZILIAN REAIS (THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT OF WHICH WILL DEPEND ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AT CLOSING) PLUS AN AMOUNT BASED ON A BRAZILIAN INTER-BANK LENDING RATE (CDI)

FROM JANUARY 1, 2011 THROUGH THE CLOSING DATE OF THE TRANSACTION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, R$625 MILLION BRAZILIAN REAIS WAS EQUIVALENT TO APPROXIMATELY $377 MILLION IN U.S.

DOLLARS. IN ORDER TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO A SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING OF THE BRAZILIAN REAIS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACT ON

FEBRUARY 7, 2011 IN THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF R$635 MILLION WHICH EXPIRES ON MARCH 31, 2011. THE JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS AND IS EXPECTED

TO BE FINALIZED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2011.

GUARANTEES

THE COMPANY HAS CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS FOR GUARANTEES RELATED TO LETTERS OF CREDIT, ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES, CERTAIN INVESTMENTS,

THIRD-PARTY LOANS RELATED TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND VARIOUS INDEMNIFICATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO THE SALE OF BUSINESS ENTITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES STANDARD INDEMNIFICATIONS TO SERVICE

PROVIDERS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES ARE OFTEN STANDARD CONTRACTUAL TERMS. CERTAIN OF THESE GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS HAVE NO STATED OR NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OR

LIMITATION TO THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS, AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL PAYMENTS FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2010, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATION FOR GUARANTEES OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND THIRD-PARTY LOANS RELATED TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS

THAT ARE QUANTIFIABLE WAS $84 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION OF WHICH WOULD BE RECOVERABLE FROM A THIRD PARTY.

IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF SELLING BUSINESS ENTITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY PURCHASERS FOR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS ENTITIES BEING SOLD, COVENANTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOLLOWING THE CLOSING, AND IN CERTAIN CASES OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM UNDISCLOSED

LIABILITIES, ADVERSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL TAXES DUE TO EITHER A CHANGE IN THE TAX LAW OR AN ADVERSE INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX LAW, OR CERTAIN NAMED LITIGATION. SUCH

INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS GENERALLY SURVIVE FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM TWO YEARS FOLLOWING THE APPLICABLE CLOSING DATE TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE RELEVANT STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, ALTHOUGH, IN SOME

CASES, THERE MAY BE OTHER AGREED UPON TERM LIMITATIONS OR NO TERM LIMITATIONS. CERTAIN OF THESE CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES WHICH HAVE TO BE INCURRED BY THE OBLIGEE BEFORE THE

COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S CONTINGENT OBLIGATION FOR INDEMNIFICATIONS RELATED TO THE SALE OF BUSINESS ENTITIES THAT ARE QUANTIFIABLE WAS

$1.34 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OF WHICH $12 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THAT DATE.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND

15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (EXCHANGE ACT)) THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY'S REPORTS UNDER THE

EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S RULES AND

FORMS, AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY

DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURES. ANY CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THE DESIRED CONTROL OBJECTIVES. THE

COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, HAS EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANY'S

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. BASED UPON THAT EVALUATION AND SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED

THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANY'S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR OBJECTIVES AT THE REASONABLE ASSURANCE LEVEL.

IN

ADDITION, THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER

THE EXCHANGE ACT) THAT OCCURRED DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED

BY MANAGEMENT, ARE UNDER THE GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF THE COMPANY'S AUDIT COMMITTEE.

THE

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.



PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF

ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OR COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT

HAS ASSESSED THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE STANDARD MEASURES ADOPTED BY MANAGEMENT IN MAKING ITS EVALUATION ARE

THE MEASURES IN THE INTERNAL-CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK PUBLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

BASED

UPON ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND THAT THERE WERE NO

MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF THAT DATE.

KPMG LLP,

AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, WHICH HAS AUDITED AND REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-K,

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC..

WE

HAVE AUDITED THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL

CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO

OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR

AUDIT ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN

OUR OPINION, THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2010, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE

ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OF THE TRAVELERS

COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE
