ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES,

INC. (THE ST. PAUL) IS INCORPORATED AS A GENERAL BUSINESS CORPORATION UNDER

THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA.  THE

ST. PAUL AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONSTITUTE ONE OF THE OLDEST INSURANCE

ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, DATING BACK TO 1853.  WE ARE A MANAGEMENT COMPANY PRINCIPALLY

ENGAGED, THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES, IN PROVIDING COMMERCIAL PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  WE

ALSO HAVE A PRESENCE IN THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY THROUGH OUR 79% MAJORITY

OWNERSHIP OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INC.

AS A MANAGEMENT COMPANY, WE OVERSEE THE OPERATIONS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES

AND PROVIDE THEM WITH CAPITAL, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES.  AT MARCH 1, 2003, THE ST. PAUL AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 9,700 PERSONS.  BASED ON TOTAL REVENUES IN 2001, WE RANKED NO. 218 ON THE

FORTUNE 500

LIST OF THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES.  OUR INTERNET WEBSITE ADDRESS IS STPAUL.COM.  WE MAKE AVAILABLE, FREE OF CHARGE, ON OR

THROUGH OUR WEBSITE, ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM

10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K AND AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR

FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF

1934 AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER WE ELECTRONICALLY FILE SUCH

MATERIAL WITH, OR FURNISH IT TO, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  OUR WEBSITE ADDRESS IS AN INACTIVE TEXTUAL

OUR PRETAX INCOME FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $176 MILLION IN 2002 INCLUDED A $472 MILLION LOSS

PROVISION, NET OF REINSURANCE, RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WE ENTERED

INTO WITH RESPECT TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION (DESCRIBED IN

MORE DETAIL ON PAGE 4 OF THIS REPORT).

IN 2001, OUR PRETAX LOSS OF $1.43 BILLION WAS DOMINATED BY $941 MILLION

OF PRETAX LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACK AND

PRETAX PROVISIONS TOTALING $735 MILLION TO STRENGTHEN PRIOR-YEAR LOSS RESERVES

IN OUR HEALTH CARE SEGMENT.  EXCLUDING

THE WESTERN MACARTHUR LOSS, THE LOSSES FROM THE TERRORIST ATTACK AND THE 2001 LOSS

PROVISION IN THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT, OUR PRETAX INCOME IN 2002 OF $648 MILLION

WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN 2001 PRETAX INCOME OF $245 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE

TO STRONG IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERWRITING RESULTS IN OUR ONGOING PROPERTY-LIABILITY

BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  OUR MAJORITY-OWNED

ASSET MANAGEMENT SUBSIDIARY, NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INC., ACHIEVED ANOTHER YEAR OF

RECORD RESULTS, DRIVEN BY STRONG PRODUCT SALES AND RECENT STRATEGIC

ACQUISITIONS.  THE PRETAX LOSS IN THE

PARENT COMPANY AND OTHER OPERATIONS CATEGORY (WHICH PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF

MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATIVE AND DEBT SERVICE EXPENSES AT THE HOLDING COMPANY

LEVEL) EXCEEDED THE COMPARABLE LOSS IN 2001 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN

DISTRIBUTIONS RELATED TO PREFERRED SECURITIES ISSUED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2001.

3

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2002, WE REVISED OUR SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE IN OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY

UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS.  OUR ONGOING

OPERATIONS ARE NOW REPORTED IN FOUR SEGMENTS, AND THE OPERATIONS WE CONSIDER TO

BE IN RUNOFF ARE REPORTED IN THREE SEGMENTS.

IN OUR ONGOING SEGMENTS, WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME OF $5.89 BILLION IN 2002

GREW 22% OVER COMPARABLE 2001 VOLUME OF $4.84 BILLION, DRIVEN BY STRONG PRICE

INCREASES THROUGHOUT THESE SEGMENTS IN ADDITION TO NEW BUSINESS IN MANY OF

THOSE OPERATIONS.  IN OUR RUNOFF

SEGMENTS, PREMIUM VOLUME OF $1.16 BILLION IN 2002 WAS 60% LESS THAN 2001

WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $2.93 BILLION, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF OUR DECISION TO

EXIT THOSE OPERATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION

SUMMARIZES MAJOR TRANSACTIONS OR EVENTS THAT OCCURRED IN 2002.

TRANSFER OF ONGOING REINSURANCE OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM

UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, WE

COMPLETED THE TRANSFER OF OUR ONGOING REINSURANCE BUSINESS (PREVIOUSLY

OPERATING UNDER THE NAME ST. PAUL RE) TO PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD.

(PLATINUM), A NEWLY FORMED BERMUDA COMPANY THAT UNDERWRITES PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY REINSURANCE ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS.

AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION, WE CONTRIBUTED $122 MILLION OF CASH

TO PLATINUM AND TRANSFERRED $349 MILLION IN ASSETS RELATING TO THE INSURANCE

RESERVES THAT WE ALSO TRANSFERRED.  IN

EXCHANGE, WE ACQUIRED SIX MILLION COMMON SHARES, REPRESENTING A 14% EQUITY

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN PLATINUM, AND A TEN-YEAR OPTION TO BUY UP TO SIX MILLION

ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $27 PER SHARE, WHICH

REPRESENTS 120% OF THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF PLATINUMS SHARES.  THE TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A PRETAX GAIN OF

$29 MILLION AND AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $54 MILLION.  THE AFTER-TAX LOSS WAS DRIVEN BY THE WRITE-OFF OF APPROXIMATELY

$73 MILLION IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY INCURRED LOSSES

RELATED TO ST. PAUL RES UNITED KINGDOM-BASED OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS

APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION IN TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRETAX GAIN.  THE TRANSFER OF ONGOING REINSURANCE

OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD. SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ON PAGE 24 OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

CONTAINS FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLATINUM TRANSACTION AND IS INCORPORATED

HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

ASBESTOS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

.  ON JUNE 3, 2002, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE AND

CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT SETTLING ALL EXISTING

AND FUTURE CLAIMS ARISING FROM ANY INSURING RELATIONSHIP OF UNITED STATES

FIDELITY AND GUARANTY COMPANY (USF&G), ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE

COMPANY (FIRE AND MARINE) AND THEIR AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING

US, WITH ANY OF MACARTHUR COMPANY, WESTERN MACARTHUR COMPANY (WESTERN

MACARTHUR), AND WESTERN ASBESTOS COMPANY (WESTERN ASBESTOS) (TOGETHER, THE

MACARTHUR COMPANIES).  THE PRETAX

IMPACT ON OUR 2002 RESULTS, NET OF EXPECTED REINSURANCE RECOVERIES AND THE

RE-EVALUATION AND APPLICATION OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, WAS

APPROXIMATELY $472 MILLION ($307 MILLION AFTER-TAX).  WE MADE PAYMENTS OF $235 MILLION IN JUNE 2002 AND $740 MILLION IN

JANUARY 2003 RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.  THE ASBESTOS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ON PAGES 27 AND 28 OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS CONTAINS FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THIS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND IS

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AND EQUITY UNITS.

IN JULY 2002, WE SOLD 17.8 MILLION OF OUR

COMMON SHARES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING FOR GROSS CONSIDERATION OF $431 MILLION, OR

$24.20 PER SHARE.  IN A SEPARATE

CONCURRENT PUBLIC OFFERING, WE SOLD 8.9 MILLION EQUITY UNITS, EACH HAVING A

STATED AMOUNT OF $50, FOR GROSS CONSIDERATION OF $443 MILLION.  EACH EQUITY UNIT INITIALLY CONSISTS OF A

THREE-YEAR FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACT FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR UNSECURED $50

SENIOR NOTE DUE IN AUGUST 2007.  TOTAL

ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE EQUITY UNITS ARE AT THE RATE OF 9.00%, CONSISTING

OF INTEREST ON THE NOTE AT A RATE OF 5.25% AND FEE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FORWARD

CONTRACT OF 3.75%.  THE FORWARD CONTRACT

REQUIRES THE INVESTOR TO PURCHASE, FOR $50, A VARIABLE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR

COMMON STOCK ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF AUGUST 16, 2005.  THE $46 MILLION PRESENT VALUE OF THE FORWARD

CONTRACT FEE PAYMENTS WAS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO OUR REPORTED COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.  THE NUMBER OF

SHARES TO BE PURCHASED WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON A FORMULA THAT CONSIDERS THE

AVERAGE TRADING PRICE OF THE STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE TIME OF SETTLEMENT

IN RELATION TO THE $24.20 PER SHARE PRICE AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING.  HAD THE SETTLEMENT DATE BEEN DECEMBER 31,

2002, WE WOULD HAVE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY 15 MILLION COMMON SHARES BASED ON THE

AVERAGE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THAT DATE.

THE COMBINED NET PROCEEDS

OF THESE OFFERINGS, AFTER UNDERWRITING COMMISSIONS AND OTHER FEES AND EXPENSES,

WERE APPROXIMATELY $842 MILLION, OF WHICH $750 MILLION WAS CONTRIBUTED AS

CAPITAL TO OUR INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2002, WE REVISED OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE TO

REFLECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE BUSINESSES ARE CURRENTLY MANAGED, INCLUDING

IN RECOGNITION OF CERTAIN OPERATIONS BEING SEPARATELY MANAGED AS RUNOFF

OPERATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS CONSISTED OF FOUR SEGMENTS

CONSTITUTING OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, AND THREE SEGMENTS COMPRISING OUR RUNOFF

OPERATIONS.  WE RETAINED THE CONCEPT OF

A SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL BUSINESS CENTER, WHICH IS AN OPERATION POSSESSING

DEDICATED UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS AND RISK CONTROL SERVICES REQUIRING SPECIALIZED

EXPERTISE AND FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON THE CUSTOMERS IT SERVES.  ELEVEN OF THOSE BUSINESS CENTERS COMPRISE

OUR

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  IN ADDITION TO OUR

UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS, WE HAVE AN INVESTMENT OPERATIONS SEGMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR

ADMINISTERING AND OVERSEEING OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

5

THE FOLLOWING IS A

SUMMARY OF THE CHANGES MADE TO OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS AT THE END OF 2002.



IN

OUR

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

SEGMENT,

ALL INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY BUSINESS THAT HAD EITHER BEEN INCLUDED IN

RESPECTIVE BUSINESS CENTERS, OR HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN THE SEPARATE

INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTY

BUSINESS CENTER,

WAS RECLASSIFIED TO THE NEWLY FORMED

INTERNATIONAL

& LLOYDS

SEGMENT (FOR ONGOING OPERATIONS) OR OUR

OTHER

SEGMENT (FOR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS CONSIDERED TO BE IN RUNOFF).



ALL

INTERNATIONAL HEALTH CARE BUSINESS, PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE

HEALTH CARE

SEGMENT, WAS RECLASSIFIED TO

THE NEWLY FORMED

OTHER

SEGMENT.



THE

INTERNATIONAL & LLOYDS

SEGMENT WAS FORMED, COMPRISED OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, ONGOING

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES (CURRENTLY

CONSISTING OF OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF

IRELAND), INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS CENTER.  ALL OPERATIONS IN THIS SEGMENT ARE UNDER

COMMON MANAGEMENT.



THE

NEW RUNOFF SEGMENT

OTHER

WAS

FORMED, COMPRISED OF ALL OF OUR INTERNATIONAL AND LLOYDS BUSINESS CONSIDERED

TO BE IN RUNOFF (INCLUDING OUR INVOLVEMENT IN INSURING THE LLOYDS CENTRAL

FUND), AS WELL AS UNIONAMERICA, THE U.K.-BASED UNDERWRITING ENTITY WE ACQUIRED

IN OUR PURCHASE OF MMI COMPANIES, INC. IN 2000.



OUR

CATASTROPHE RISK

BUSINESS CENTER,

PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE

SPECIALTY

COMMERCIAL

SEGMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY, WAS SPLIT INTO TWO OPERATIONS,

WITH

PERSONAL CATASTROPHE RISK

REMAINING IN THE

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

SEGMENT AND

COMMERCIAL CATASTROPHE RISK

MOVING

TO THE

COMMERCIAL LINES

SEGMENT

AS PART OF THE

PROPERTY SOLUTIONS

BUSINESS CENTER.

OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS

UNDERWRITE PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE AND PROVIDE INSURANCE-RELATED

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE

UNITED STATES AND IN SELECTED INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR LARGEST PRIMARY INSURANCE UNDERWRITING

SUBSIDIARY IS FIRE AND MARINE.  THE

PRIMARY SOURCES OF PROPERTY-LIABILITY REVENUES ARE PREMIUMS EARNED FROM

INSURANCE POLICIES AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS, INCOME EARNED FROM THE INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND GAINS FROM SALES OF INVESTMENTS.

ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS PUBLISHED IN BESTS

REVIEW WITH RESPECT TO COMMERCIAL LINES PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURERS DOING

BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS

RANKED AS THE FOURTH-LARGEST ON THE BASIS OF 2001 DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUMS.

PRINCIPAL DEPARTMENTS AND PRODUCTS

IN GENERAL, OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURANCE OPERATIONS UNDERWRITE THE FOLLOWING TYPES, OR LINES, OF PROPERTY

AND LIABILITY COVERAGES.



GENERAL

LIABILITY, WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY EXPOSURES INCLUDING PERSONAL

INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE ARISING FROM GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, PRODUCTS

SOLD AND COMPLETED WORK;



LIABILITY

COVERAGES FOR CORPORATIONS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THEIR

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, AND FOR A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS LAWYERS,

INSURANCE AGENTS AND REAL ESTATE AGENTS;



PROPERTY

INSURANCE, WHICH INSURES TANGIBLE PROPERTY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR LOSS OF USE;



COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL, WHICH PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY COVERAGE (FOR DAMAGES

SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY FIRE, WIND, HAIL, WATER, THEFT, AND VANDALISM) AND

LIABILITY COVERAGE (FOR THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY FROM ACCIDENTS OCCURRING ON THE

INSUREDS PREMISES OR ARISING OUT OF THEIR OPERATIONS);



COMMERCIAL

AUTO, WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR BUSINESSES AGAINST LOSSES RESULTING FROM

THEIR OWNERSHIP, MAINTENANCE OR USE OF AUTOMOBILES AND TRUCKS, INCLUDING LOSSES

RESULTING FROM BODILY INJURY TO THIRD PARTIES, PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO AN INSUREDS

VEHICLE AND PROPERTY DAMAGE TO OTHER VEHICLES AND OTHER PROPERTY;

6



WORKERS

COMPENSATION, WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYERS FOR SPECIFIED BENEFITS PAYABLE

UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW FOR WORKPLACE INJURIES, DISABILITIES OR DEATH TO

EMPLOYEES, WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT;



INLAND

MARINE, WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR PROPERTY WHICH IS GENERALLY MOBILE IN

NATURE, SUCH AS CONTRACTORS EQUIPMENT OR CARGO BEING SHIPPED BY TRUCK OR RAIL,

AS WELL AS INSTRUMENTALITIES OF TRANSPORTATION OR COMMUNICATION SUCH AS

BRIDGES, TUNNELS AND COMPUTERS, AND CERTAIN PROPERTY RISKS SUCH AS BUILDERS

RISK;



CONTRACT

SURETY BONDS AND COMMERCIAL SURETY BONDS; AND



UMBRELLA

COVERAGES, WHICH PROVIDE SPECIFIED LAYERS OF COVERAGE ON ACCOUNTS WHERE WE DO

NOT PROVIDE THE PRIMARY LIABILITY COVERAGE.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

THESE LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING TYPES OF COVERAGE THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO AN

OPERATING SEGMENT, ARE INCLUDED IN THE SEGMENT DESCRIPTIONS THAT FOLLOW THIS

SECTION.

THROUGH ONE OR MORE LINES

UNDERWRITTEN BY OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS, INCLUDING PROPERTY AND GENERAL

LIABILITY, WE ARE EXPOSED TO LOSSES FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND MOLD

CLAIMS.  ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS INCLUDE

CLAIMS OF LIABILITY FOR ALLEGED DAMAGE FROM HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC MATERIALS.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR GENERAL LIABILITY

POLICIES INCLUDE AN ABSOLUTE POLLUTION EXCLUSION; HOWEVER, IN SEVERAL BUSINESS

CENTERS, PARTICULARLY

OIL AND GAS

AND

UMBRELLA/EXCESS & SURPLUS LINES

IN

OUR SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, WE CONTINUE TO UNDERWRITE NEW BUSINESS WITH

LIMITED POLLUTION COVERAGE.  UNDER

CERTAIN POLICIES WE UNDERWRITE, WE ARE EXPOSED TO LOSSES FROM CLAIMS OF MOLD

AND MOISTURE INFILTRATION, WHICH CAN CAUSE PERSONAL INJURY AND DAMAGE TO

PROPERTY.  CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS HAVE

SUBMITTED CLAIMS TO US UNDER THEIR PROPERTY AND GENERAL LIABILITY POLICES THAT

INCLUDE DAMAGES RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF MOLD.  PREDOMINANTLY, THESE MOLD CLAIMS ARE FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE

SUBMITTED UNDER A FIRST-PARTY PROPERTY POLICY, OR FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT

THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY SUBMITTED UNDER A GENERAL LIABILITY POLICY.  FEW PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS RELATED TO MOLD

UNDER WORKERS COMPENSATION OR GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED

TO US.  THE CAUSE AND TYPE OF DAMAGE OF

EACH PROPERTY DAMAGE OR BODILY INJURY INCIDENT INVOLVING MOLD DETERMINES

WHETHER THE CLAIM MAY BE A COVERED LOSS UNDER A PROPERTY POLICY OR IF THERE IS

A DUTY TO DEFEND AND/OR INDEMNIFY AN INSURED IN A THIRD-PARTY CLAIM.

IN

ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF ASBESTOS IN

BUILDING MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION. .

THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS INCLUDED ON PAGES 48 AND 49 OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF OUR HISTORICAL EXPOSURE TO AND

LOSSES FROM ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE.

THE UNDERWRITING RESULTS

BY SEGMENT TABLE IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS INCLUDED ON PAGE 36

OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH SUMMARIZES WRITTEN PREMIUMS,

UNDERWRITING RESULTS, STATUTORY COMBINED RATIOS AND ADJUSTED COMBINED RATIOS

(AS DESCRIBED IN THE FOOTNOTE TO THE TABLE) FOR EACH OF OUR UNDERWRITING

SEGMENTS FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES MORE

INFORMATION ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF, AND PRODUCTS OFFERED BY, OUR

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SEGMENTS.

ONGOING

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL.

THIS SEGMENT CONSISTS OF BUSINESS CENTERS THAT WE HAVE DESIGNATED

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS BECAUSE EACH PROVIDES DEDICATED UNDERWRITING,

CLAIM AND RISK CONTROL SERVICES THAT REQUIRE SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE, AND EACH

FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON THE RESPECTIVE CUSTOMERS IT SERVES.  INSURANCE COVERAGE IS OFTEN PROVIDED ON

PROPRIETARY INSURANCE FORMS.  THOSE

BUSINESS CENTERS, WHICH COLLECTIVELY GENERATED $1.99 BILLION OF NET WRITTEN

PREMIUMS IN 2002 (ACCOUNTING FOR 34% OF OUR ONGOING SEGMENTS PREMIUM VOLUME

AND 28% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME) AND OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY IN

THE UNITED STATES, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

FINANCIAL

& PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

PROVIDES PROPERTY AND LIABILITY

COVERAGES FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND MANAGEMENT

LIABILITY COVERAGES FOR CORPORATIONS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AGAINST LOSSES

CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OR MISCONDUCT OF NAMED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, AND

ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COVERAGES FOR A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS LAWYERS,

INSURANCE AGENTS AND REAL ESTATE AGENTS FOR LIABILITY FROM ERRORS AND OMISSIONS

7

COMMITTED IN THE COURSE

OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT OR PRACTICE.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT OBSERVED ANY NOTABLE INCREASE IN DIRECTORS AND

OFFICERS CLAIMS IN THIS BUSINESS CENTER, IN VIEW OF RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF

CORPORATE MALFEASANCE AND PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF

2002 (AND REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT

TO THAT LAW), AND THE GENERAL DECLINE IN THE SECURITIES MARKETS, THE FREQUENCY

AND SEVERITY OF SUCH CLAIMS COULD INCREASE.

TECHNOLOGY

OFFERS A PORTFOLIO OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO COMPANIES INVOLVED IN

TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HEALTH SCIENCES AND ELECTRONICS

MANUFACTURING.   THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE

PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, UMBRELLA,

INTERNET LIABILITY, AND TECHNOLOGY ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COVERAGES.  THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIS BUSINESS

CENTER INCLUDE DEDICATED UNDERWRITING, RISK CONTROL AND SPECIALIZED CLAIM

HANDLING.

UMBRELLA/EXCESS & SURPLUS LINES

CONSISTS

OF THREE DISTINCT BUSINESS UNITS.  THE

SPECIALTY EXCESS AND UMBRELLA

UNIT FOCUSES

ON UMBRELLA AND EXCESS LIABILITY BUSINESS FOR RETAIL AGENTS AND BROKERS, WHERE

OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE PROVIDING THE PRIMARY COVERAGE.  THE COVERAGES UNDERWRITTEN ARE TYPICALLY

COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY AND PRODUCT LIABILITY.  UMBRELLA COVERAGE MAY ALSO BE UNDERWRITTEN

OVER A COMPANY THAT RETAINS RISK OR HAS A SELF-INSURED RETENTION, INSTEAD OF A

SCHEDULED UNDERLYING POLICY.  THE

EXCESS & SURPLUS LINES

UNIT

UNDERWRITES NON-ADMITTED INDIVIDUAL RISK BUSINESS FOR ESTABLISHED WHOLESALE

DISTRIBUTORS.  THE COVERAGES TYPICALLY

UNDERWRITTEN INCLUDE COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY AND PRODUCT

LIABILITY.  THE

E&S UNDERWRITING FACILITIES

UNIT

UNDERWRITES LIABILITY AND PROPERTY FACILITIES PRODUCED BY WHOLESALERS AND

MANAGING GENERAL AGENTS, WHICH ARE LICENSED INSURANCE AGENTS THAT MANAGE ALL OR

PART OF AN INSURERS CUSTOMERS WITH UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS - PRIMARILY THOSE WITH

MODERATE TO HIGH HAZARD EXPOSURES REQUIRING EXPERTISE IN THE SURPLUS LINES

MARKETPLACE AND THE ABILITY TO USE POLICY FORMS NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS.  COVERAGES INCLUDE

PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF UMBRELLA.

PUBLIC

SECTOR SERVICES

MARKETS INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO

MUNICIPALITIES, COUNTIES, INDIAN NATION GAMING AND SELECTED SPECIAL GOVERNMENT

DISTRICTS, INCLUDING WATER AND SEWER UTILITIES, AND NON-RAIL TRANSIT

AUTHORITIES.  THE POLICIES WRITTEN BY

THIS BUSINESS CENTER TYPICALLY COVER PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL

LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION AND ERRORS AND OMISSIONS EXPOSURES.

DISCOVER RE

, WHICH PRINCIPALLY PROVIDES

COMMERCIAL AUTO LIABILITY, GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, AND

PROPERTY COVERAGES, SERVES RETAIL BROKERS AND INSUREDS THAT ARE COMMITTED TO

THE ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER (ART) MARKET.

ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER TECHNIQUES ARE TYPICALLY UTILIZED BY

SOPHISTICATED INSUREDS THAT ARE FINANCIALLY ABLE TO ASSUME A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF THEIR OWN LOSSES.

DISCOVER RE

IS ORGANIZED IN TWO UNDERWRITING UNITS, EACH OF WHICH UNDERWRITES PRIMARY

INSURANCE IN CONNECTION WITH ARRANGEMENTS THAT INVOLVE THE CLIENT OR A CAPTIVE

INSURER AGREEING TO BEAR MUCH OF THE COVERED RISK.  THE INDIVIDUAL RISK UNIT MARKETS PRODUCTS TO INDIVIDUAL INSUREDS

THAT ARE COMFORTABLE RETAINING THE MORE PREDICTABLE LAYER OF THEIR EXPECTED

LOSSES, WHETHER IT BE A LARGE DEDUCTIBLE OR A TRUE SELF-INSURED RETENTION.  UNDER A LARGE DEDUCTIBLE STRUCTURE WE ARE

EXPOSED NOT ONLY TO THE RISK OF LOSS UNDER THE POLICY BUT ALSO TO THE RISK OF

THE INSUREDS INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERMS

OF THE AGREEMENT.  WE MITIGATE THE

LATTER RISK BY COLLATERALIZING ALL OR A PORTION OF THE EXPECTED LOSSES IN THE

INSUREDS RETAINED LAYER.  THE SECOND

UNDERWRITING UNIT IS THE CAPTIVE/PROGRAM UNIT, WHICH FOCUSES ON CAPTIVE

BUSINESS.  SIMILAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL

RISK ACCOUNTS, THE CAPTIVES RETAIN THE MORE PREDICTABLE FREQUENCY LAYER OF

EXPECTED LOSSES, WITH

DISCOVER RE

PROVIDING EXCESS COVERAGE

ABOVE THE CAPTIVES RETENTION.  IN SOME

INSTANCES THE CAPTIVE/PROGRAM UNIT MAY RETAIN LITTLE OR NO RISK, BUT EARNS

REVENUES PRIMARILY FROM FEES COLLECTED FOR PROVIDING ACCESS TO POLICIES FROM AN

ADMITTED INSURANCE COMPANY.

SPECIALTY

PROGRAMS

UNDERWRITES INSURANCE PROGRAMS FOR SELECTED

INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NATIONAL IN SCOPE AND HAVE SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS,

INCLUDING FRANCHISES AND ASSOCIATIONS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT, RENTAL, PROPANE,

AND RURAL ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES.  SPECIFIC

LINES OF INSURANCE WRITTEN BY THESE BUSINESS CENTERS INCLUDE PROPERTY,

COMMERCIAL AUTO, GENERAL LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, INLAND MARINE, ERRORS

AND OMISSIONS, UMBRELLA AND FIDELITY.

UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES, PREMIUMS AND POLICY FORMS ISSUED BY THIS

BUSINESS SEGMENT VARY BY PROGRAM AND BY JURISDICTION BECAUSE OF LOCAL MARKET

CONDITIONS AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

COVERAGE MAY BE ON A PRIMARY OR AN EXCESS BASIS, DEPENDING ON HOW THE

COVERAGE IS STRUCTURED FOR A PARTICULAR INSURED.  BECAUSE OF THE NATIONAL SCOPE OF THE PROGRAMS WRITTEN BY THIS

BUSINESS CENTER, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO UNUSUALLY LARGE LOSSES IF A SINGLE

INDUSTRY WHOSE MEMBERS ARE INSURED THROUGH AN ASSOCIATION IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY A MAJOR EVENT OR DEVELOPMENT, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE EVENT OR DEVELOPMENT

CAUSES LOSSES THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY.

OIL AND GAS

PROVIDES SPECIALIZED PROPERTY AND LIABILITY PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS INVOLVED IN

THE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS INCLUDING OPERATORS, DRILLERS AND

SERVICING CONTRACTORS.  THE POLICIES

WRITTEN BY THIS BUSINESS CENTER INSURE DRILLING RIGS, NATURAL GAS FACILITIES,

PIPELINES, PRODUCTION AND GATHERING PLATFORMS, AND COVER RISKS INCLUDING

PHYSICAL DAMAGE, LIABILITY AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION.

OCEAN

MARINE

FORMS OF MARINE TRANSPORTATION AND THE COMPANIES THAT SERVE THEM, AS WELL AS

OTHER BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE.  OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS FALL UNDER FOUR MAIN COVERAGE

PERSONAL

CATASTROPHE RISK

UNDERWRITES PERSONAL PROPERTY COVERAGES IN

CERTAIN STATES EXPOSED TO EARTHQUAKES AND HURRICANES, INCLUDING PRINCIPALLY

CALIFORNIA AND FLORIDA.  AS WITH OUR

COMMERCIAL CATASTROPHE RISK COVERAGES UNDERWRITTEN IN OUR COMMERCIAL LINES

SEGMENT, A SINGLE LOSS EVENT MAY PRODUCE HEAVY LOSSES UNDER A NUMBER OF

POLICIES.  WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE RISK

TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED THROUGH NATURAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE.  THE NATURAL CATASTROPHE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE

BUSINESS CENTER

OFFERS INSURANCE COVERAGES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF MANUFACTURING, WHOLESALE,

SERVICE AND RETAIL ENTERPRISES FOR WHICH ANNUAL INSURANCE COSTS TYPICALLY RANGE

FROM $75,000 TO $1 MILLION.  THIS

BUSINESS CENTER ALSO OFFERS LOSS-SENSITIVE CASUALTY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING

SIGNIFICANT DEDUCTIBLE AND SELF-INSURED RETENTION OPTIONS, FOR THE HIGHER END

OF THE MIDDLE MARKET SECTOR.

THE

BUSINESS CENTER COMBINES OUR LARGE ACCOUNT PROPERTY

BUSINESS WITH THE COMMERCIAL PORTION OF OUR CATASTROPHE RISK BUSINESS AND

ALLOWS US TO TAKE A UNIFIED APPROACH TO LARGE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY RISKS.  LARGE ACCOUNTS ARE TYPICALLY THOSE WITH

PROPERTY PREMIUMS GREATER THAN $100,000.

THIS BUSINESS CENTER FOCUSES ON UNDERWRITING PROPERTY COVERAGES FOR REAL

PROPERTIES EXPOSED TO LIGHT TO MODERATE HAZARDS, SUCH AS HOTELS AND OFFICE

BUILDINGS, RATHER THAN HIGH HAZARD PROPERTIES SUCH AS PETROCHEMICAL, MINING AND

OTHER BASIC PROCESS INDUSTRIES.  MANY OF

THE PRODUCTS UNDERWRITTEN BY THIS BUSINESS CENTER ARE STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, IN

WHICH WE WRITE COVERAGE FOR A SPECIFIED LAYER OF RISK AND OTHER INSURERS

UNDERWRITE OTHER LAYERS.  BECAUSE THIS

BUSINESS CENTER INCLUDES OUR PREVIOUS COMMERCIAL CATASTROPHE RISK BUSINESS,

SOME OF THE POLICIES UNDERWRITTEN BY IT EXPOSE US TO CATASTROPHE RISK,

PRINCIPALLY EARTHQUAKE AND HURRICANE, IN WHICH A SINGLE LOSS EVENT CAN PRODUCE

HEAVY LOSSES UNDER A NUMBER OF POLICIES.

DESCRIBED IN THE NATURAL CATASTROPHE RISK MANAGEMENT SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS FORM 10-K AT ITEM

SIGNED INTO LAW THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002.  A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT,

AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON US, IS INCLUDED IN THE TERRORISM RISK AND

LEGISLATION SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS INCLUDED ON PAGES

25 AND 26 OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED

HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

RESULTS FROM OUR

PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH PROVIDE SPECIALIZED

UNDERWRITING SKILLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR THE CLASSES OF BUSINESS

THAT THEY UNDERWRITE, ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT. THESE

POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS SERVE TO INCREASE THE UNDERWRITING CAPACITY OF PARTICIPATING

COMPANIES FOR INSURANCE POLICIES WHERE THE CONCEN­TRATION OF RISK IS SO HIGH OR

THE AMOUNT AT RISK IS SO LARGE THAT A SINGLE COMPANY COULD NOT PRUDENTLY ACCEPT

THE ENTIRE RISK. WE LIMIT OUR PARTICIPATION IN THESE POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS.

SURETY & CONSTRUCTION

.  WE CONSIDER OUR SURETY & CONSTRUCTION

SEGMENT A SPECIALTY OPERATION, BECAUSE EACH BUSINESS REQUIRES SPECIALIZED

UNDERWRITING, RISK MANAGEMENT AND CLAIM EXPERTISE.  THESE OPERATIONS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR $1.27 BILLION OF NET

WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2002 (ACCOUNTING FOR 22% OF OUR ONGOING SEGMENTS

PREMIUM VOLUME AND 18% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME), ARE

INCLUDED IN THE SAME SEGMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR SHARED CUSTOMER BASE AND

EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS THE SIMILARITY IN EXPERTISE REQUIRED TO

UNDERWRITE THESE COVERAGES.

ACCORDING TO DATA

PUBLISHED BY THE SURETY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, OUR DOMESTIC SURETY OPERATIONS

WERE THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE UNITED STATES BASED ON 2001 DIRECT PREMIUMS

WRITTEN.  IN ADDITION TO ITS U.S. OPERATIONS,

OUR SURETY BUSINESS CENTER ALSO INCLUDES AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES, THE LEADING

SURETY UNDERWRITER IN MEXICO, AND OUR CANADIAN OPERATIONS, ST. PAUL GUARANTEE

AND NORTHERN INDEMNITY, WHICH, ON A COMBINED BASIS, MAKE US THE LARGEST SURETY

BOND UNDERWRITER IN CANADA.

OUR

SURETY

BUSINESS CENTER UNDERWRITES SURETY

BONDS, WHICH ARE AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH ONE PARTY (THE SURETY) GUARANTEES TO

ANOTHER PARTY (THE OWNER OR OBLIGEE) THAT A THIRD PARTY (THE CONTRACTOR OR

PRINCIPAL) WILL PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL OR LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS.  THE SURETY IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR EVALUATING THE RISK TO BE COVERED AND FOR DETERMINING IF THE PRINCIPAL

MEETS THE UNDERWRITING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BOND.  THE PREMIUM CHARGED WILL REFLECT THE SIZE AND TYPE OF THE

OBLIGATION.  BY OFFERING A BOND, THE

SURETY IS OFFERING ASSURANCE THAT ITS CUSTOMER WILL MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS AS

SPECIFIED UNDER THE BOND.

OUR SURETY BUSINESS

CENTER WAS EXPANDED BY OUR MARCH 2002 ACQUISITION OF ST. PAUL GUARANTEE IN

CANADA (FORMERLY LONDON GUARANTEE), AND OUR ACQUISITION IN LATE 2001 OF THE

RIGHT TO SEEK TO RENEW SURETY BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY UNDERWRITTEN BY FIREMANS

FUND INSURANCE COMPANY.

FOR

CONTRACT SURETY

, WE PROVIDE BID,

PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS TO A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CLIENTS SPECIALIZING IN

GENERAL CONTRACTING, HIGHWAY AND BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION, ASPHALT PAVING,

UNDERGROUND AND PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION, MANUFACTURING, CIVIL AND HEAVY

ENGINEERING, AND MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION.  BID BONDS PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE THAT

BIDS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED IN GOOD FAITH AND THAT THE CONTRACTOR INTENDS TO ENTER

INTO THE CONTRACT AT THE PRICE BID AND PROVIDE THE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE AND

PAYMENT BONDS.  PERFORMANCE BONDS

REQUIRE US TO FULFILL THE CONTRACTORS OBLIGATIONS TO THE OBLIGEE SHOULD THE CONTRACTOR

FAIL TO PERFORM UNDER THE CONTRACT.

PAYMENT BONDS GUARANTEE THAT THE CONTRACTOR WILL PAY CERTAIN

SUBCONTRACTOR, LABOR AND MATERIAL BILLS ASSOCIATED WITH A PROJECT.

FOR

COMMERCIAL SURETY

, WHICH COMPRISES BONDS

COVERING OBLIGATIONS OFTEN REQUIRED BY LAW, THE BONDS THAT WE CURRENTLY

UNDERWRITE ARE AS FOLLOWS.



LICENSE

AND PERMIT BONDS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTES OR REGULATIONS FOR A NUMBER OF

PURPOSES, INCLUDING GUARANTEEING THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN TAXES AND FEES AND

PROVIDING CONSUMER PROTECTION AS A CONDITION TO GRANTING LICENSES RELATED TO

SELLING REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING TAX AND CUSTOMS BONDS;



RECLAMATION

BONDS, WHICH COVER RECLAMATION COSTS FOR MINING AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES;

10



FIDUCIARY

BONDS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTES, COURTS OR CONTRACTS FOR THE PROTECTION

OF THOSE ON WHOSE BEHALF A FIDUCIARY (SUCH AS AN EXECUTOR OF AN ESTATE OR A

GUARDIAN OF A MINOR) ACTS, INCLUDING PROBATE BONDS AND DEPOSITORY BONDS;



COURT

BONDS, WHICH ARE BONDS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED OF EITHER A PLAINTIFF OR A

DEFENDANT IN A LAWSUIT;



PUBLIC

OFFICIAL BONDS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTES AND REGULATIONS TO GUARANTEE THE

LAWFUL AND FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES OF OFFICE BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS;



INDEMNITY

BONDS, WHICH ARE OBLIGATIONS TO HOLD A THIRD PARTY HARMLESS OF DAMAGES RELATED

TO AN UNDERLYING OBLIGATION TO PERFORM, MAINTAIN OR PAY;



WORKERS

COMPENSATION SELF-INSURER BONDS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTES AND REGULATIONS

TO GUARANTEE THE PAYMENT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS TO INJURED WORKERS

OF COMPANIES THAT WISH TO SELF-INSURE THOSE OBLIGATIONS;



TRANSFER

AGENT INDEMNITY BONDS, WHICH PROTECT THE ISSUER OF SECURITIES AND THE TRANSFER

AGENT AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOST SHARE CERTIFICATE MAY BE PRESENTED

LATER BY AN INNOCENT PURCHASER FOR VALUE; AND



OTHER

MISCELLANEOUS BONDS.

LIKE CONTRACT SURETY

BONDS, COMMERCIAL SURETY BONDS EXPOSE US TO THE RISK THAT THE PRINCIPAL - E.G.,

THE FIDUCIARY IN A FIDUCIARY BOND OR THE MINING COMPANY IN A RECLAMATION BOND -

WILL NOT PERFORM THE DUTIES REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT, APPLICABLE LAW OR

REGULATION.  ACCORDINGLY, WE UNDERWRITE

AND PRICE THESE PRODUCTS BY ANALYZING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PRINCIPALS

CREDITWORTHINESS AND ABILITY TO PERFORM.

CERTAIN SECTORS OF OUR

COMMERCIAL SURETY BUSINESS TEND TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY LOW FREQUENCY BUT

POTENTIALLY HIGH SEVERITY LOSSES.  IN

OCTOBER 2000, WE MADE A STRATEGIC DECISION TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE

EXPOSURES IN THESE SECTORS.  SINCE THAT

TIME, WE HAD REDUCED OUR TOTAL COMMERCIAL SURETY GROSS OPEN BOND EXPOSURE BY

OVER 40% BY DECEMBER 31, 2002.

WITHIN THESE SECTORS OF

OUR COMMERCIAL SURETY BUSINESS, WE HAVE EXPOSURES RELATED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF

ACCOUNTS, WHICH ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.  IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OTHER ACCOUNTS HAVE

EXPERIENCED DETERIORATION IN CREDITWORTHINESS SINCE WE ISSUED BONDS TO

THEM.  GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC

CLIMATE AND ITS IMPACT ON THESE COMPANIES, WE MAY EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN

CLAIMS AND, POSSIBLY, INCUR HIGH SEVERITY LOSSES.  SUCH LOSSES WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CLAIMS

ARE FILED AND DETERMINED TO BE A VALID LOSS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE SURETY

BOND ISSUED.

11

WE CONTINUE WITH OUR

INTENTION TO EXIT THE SEGMENTS OF THE COMMERCIAL SURETY MARKET DISCUSSED ABOVE

THAT ARE CHARACTERIZED BY LOW FREQUENCY BUT POTENTIALLY HIGH SEVERITY BONDS BY

CEASING TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, TERMINATING THE OUTSTANDING

BONDS.  WE CONTINUE TO BE A MARKET FOR

TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL SURETY BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES LOW-LIMIT BUSINESS SUCH

AS LICENSE AND PERMIT, PROBATE, PUBLIC OFFICIAL, AND CUSTOMS BONDS.

OUR

CONSTRUCTION

BUSINESS CENTER OFFERS A

VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL INSURANCE, CONSISTING

OF WORKERS COMPENSATION, GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL AUTO COVERAGES, AND

OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, TO A BROAD RANGE OF CONTRACTORS AND PARTIES

RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.

INTERNATIONAL & LLOYDS.

FOLLOWING THE REALIGNMENT OF OUR BUSINESS

SEGMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, OUR

INTERNATIONAL

& LLOYDS

SEGMENT, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR $808 MILLION OF NET

WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2002 (ACCOUNTING FOR 14% OF OUR ONGOING SEGMENTS

PREMIUM VOLUME AND 11% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME), CONSISTS OF

OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT LLOYDS, AND OUR ONGOING SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING OUR

GLOBAL UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS CENTER

(COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO HEREAFTER AS INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTIES).

LLOYDS IS A SUBSCRIPTION

INSURANCE MARKET IN WHICH MEMBER INDIVIDUALS AND FIRMS PARTICIPATE TO PROVIDE

INSURANCE TO CUSTOMERS SEEKING COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF RISKS.  THE MEMBERS OF LLOYDS ARE ORGANIZED INTO

SYNDICATES CONSISTING OF ONE OR MORE MEMBERS.  THE MEMBERS PROVIDE UNDERWRITING CAPACITY WITH WHICH THE

SYNDICATE MAKES COVERAGE AVAILABLE TO PARTICULAR CUSTOMERS.  SYNDICATES ARE OPERATED BY MANAGING AGENCIES

THAT RECEIVE FEES IN RESPECT OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE IN BOTH UNDERWRITING

AND CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION.  COVERAGE IS

PLACED BY INSURANCE BROKERS ACTING ON BEHALF OF INSUREDS.

THROUGH A SINGLE

WHOLLY-OWNED SYNDICATE AT LLOYDS ESTABLISHED IN 1996 AS SYNDICATE 1211 AND

RE-BRANDED AS SYNDICATE 5000 IN NOVEMBER 2002, WE UNDERWRITE INSURANCE IN FOUR

PRINCIPAL LINES OF BUSINESS.

AVIATION,

MARINE, GLOBAL PROPERTY

AND

PERSONAL LINES.

AVIATION

UNDERWRITES A BROAD SPECTRUM OF

INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE, MANUFACTURER, AIRPORT AND GENERAL AVIATION

BUSINESS.

MARINE

UNDERWRITES ENERGY, CARGO AND HULL COVERAGES.

GLOBAL

PROPERTY

UNDERWRITES PROPERTY COVERAGES WORLDWIDE.

PERSONAL

LINES

PROVIDES SPECIALIZED ACCIDENT AND HEALTH COVERAGES FOR

INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS, INCLUDING PERSONAL ACCIDENT, KIDNAP AND RANSOM, AND

PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE.  PRIOR TO

2003, THE AVIATION AND PERSONAL LINES BUSINESSES WERE UNDERWRITTEN THROUGH

OTHER SYNDICATES THAT WE MANAGED AND IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATED WITH OTHER

MEMBERS OF LLOYDS.  WE DO NOT PROVIDE

SYNDICATE 5000 WITH DIRECT CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS BUT RATHER OBTAIN BANK LETTERS

OF CREDIT TO SUPPORT THE SYNDICATES INSURANCE EXPOSURE.  WE ARE LIABLE, HOWEVER, IF THESE LETTERS OF

CREDIT ARE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE SYNDICATES LOSSES AND MUST REIMBURSE THE

BANKS THAT ISSUE THE LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR ANY AMOUNTS THEY PAID ON OUR BEHALF.

IN ADDITION TO THE

PROPERTY-LIABILITY BUSINESS WE UNDERWRITE AT LLOYDS, WE ALSO MANAGE, AND HAVE

MADE A COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE 13% OF THE CAPACITY OF, SYNDICATE 779 AT LLOYDS,

WHICH UNDERWRITES SPECIALTY TERM LIFE INSURANCE TO INDIVIDUALS PRIMARILY IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

OUR ONGOING INTERNATIONAL

SPECIALTIES ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF

IRELAND, WHERE WE OFFER SPECIALIZED INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO A

VARIETY OF INDUSTRY SECTORS.  OUR

ONGOING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS PRIMARILY UNDERWRITE EMPLOYERS LIABILITY

(SIMILAR TO WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE IN THE U.S.), PUBLIC AND PRODUCT

LIABILITY (THE EQUIVALENT OF GENERAL LIABILITY), PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY

(SIMILAR TO DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS COVERAGE) AND

PROPERTY.  THE

GLOBAL UNDERWRITING

BUSINESS CENTER

UNDERWRITES HOME-FOREIGN BUSINESS, REPRESENTING COVERAGE FOR A U.S.

ORGANIZATIONS PROPERTY-LIABILITY EXPOSURES IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, AND

REVERSE-FLOW BUSINESS, WHICH INVOLVES COVERAGE OF A FOREIGN ORGANIZATIONS

PROPERTY OR LIABILITY EXPOSURES LOCATED IN THE COUNTRY OF THE INSURERS

DOMICILE, AS PART OF A GLOBAL PROGRAM.

THE

HEALTH

CARE

SEGMENT, WHICH GENERATED $173 MILLION IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS

IN 2002 (ACCOUNTING FOR 15% OF OUR RUNOFF SEGMENTS PREMIUM VOLUME AND 3% OF

OUR CONSOLIDATED WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME), HISTORICALLY PROVIDED A WIDE RANGE OF

MEDICAL LIABILITY INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM, INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL

PHYSICIANS, PHYSICIAN GROUPS, HOSPITALS, MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND

OTHER ORGANIZATION, SO THAT WE ARE EXPOSED TO LOSSES FROM THE MALPRACTICE OF

ANY ONE PRACTITIONER ON THE STAFF OF, OR WITH PRIVILEGES AT, THE

ORGANIZATION.  POLICIES WRITTEN BY THIS

SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO HIGH SEVERITY OF CLAIMS.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, WE ANNOUNCED OUR INTENTION TO EXIT

THE MEDICAL LIABILITY INSURANCE MARKET, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS.  ACCORDINGLY, THIS SEGMENT

WAS CONSIDERED TO BE IN RUNOFF IN 2002.

AS PART OF THE FOURTH-QUARTER 2002 REVISION OF OUR SEGMENT REPORTING

STRUCTURE, THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THIS SEGMENT WAS

RECLASSIFIED TO THE OTHER SEGMENT.

PREMIUMS IN 2002 (ACCOUNTING FOR 65% OF OUR RUNOFF SEGMENTS PREMIUM VOLUME AND

11% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED WRITTEN PREMIUM VOLUME).  IN THE YEARS PRIOR TO 2002, OUR

REINSURANCE

SEGMENT GENERALLY UNDERWROTE TREATY AND FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE FOR PROPERTY,

LIABILITY, OCEAN MARINE, SURETY, CERTAIN SPECIALTY CLASSES OF COVERAGE, AND

NONTRADITIONAL REINSURANCE, WHICH PROVIDED LIMITED TRADITIONAL UNDERWRITING

RISK PROTECTION COMBINED WITH FINANCIAL RISK PROTECTION.

IN LATE 2001, WE

ANNOUNCED OUR INTENTION TO CEASE UNDERWRITING CERTAIN TYPES OF REINSURANCE

COVERAGES AND NARROW OUR GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE IN 2002.  IN NOVEMBER 2002, WE TRANSFERRED OUR ONGOING REINSURANCE

OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD. (PLATINUM) WHILE RETAINING

NEW YORK, TEXAS, FLORIDA AND ILLINOIS.

OUR PRIMARY INSURANCE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES IS

PRODUCED PRIMARILY THROUGH OVER 4,000 INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENCIES AND

INSURANCE BROKERS.  THE NEEDS OF AGENTS,

BROKERS AND POLICYHOLDERS ARE ADDRESSED THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 100 OFFICES

LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.

DISCOVER RE, A COMPONENT OF OUR SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL SEGMENT,

UNDERWRITES ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER BUSINESS FROM ITS FARMINGTON, CT

HEADQUARTERS AND FROM REGIONAL OFFICES IN ATLANTA, PITTSBURGH, AND SAN FRANCISCO.

OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS ARE HEADQUARTERED IN LONDON AND UNDERWRITE INSURANCE PRIMARILY

THROUGH DOMESTIC OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND THE REPUBLIC OF

IRELAND.  WE ALSO UNDERWRITE SURETY

BUSINESS IN MEXICO.

THROUGH OUR INVOLVEMENT

AT LLOYDS, WE HAVE ACCESS TO INSURANCE MARKETS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTRY IN

THE WORLD.  AT OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AT

LLOYDS, WE UNDERWRITE PROPERTY-LIABILITY BUSINESS THROUGH A SINGLE, WHOLLY

OWNED SYNDICATE (SYNDICATE 5000) AND SPECIALTY LIFE INSURANCE THROUGH OUR 13%

PARTICIPATION IN SYNDICATE 779.  OUR

MANAGING AGENCY, OPERATING UNDER THE NAME ST. PAUL SYNDICATE MANAGEMENT LTD.,

UNDERWRITES BUSINESS FOR THESE SYNDICATES, WHICH REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 3% OF

LLOYDS TOTAL CAPACITY.

RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

GENERAL INFORMATION.

WHEN CLAIMS ARE MADE BY OR AGAINST

POLICYHOLDERS, ANY AMOUNTS THAT OUR UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS PAY OR EXPECT TO

PAY TO THE CLAIMANT ARE REFERRED TO AS LOSSES.

THE COSTS OF INVESTIGATING, RESOLVING AND PROCESSING THESE CLAIMS ARE

REFERRED TO AS LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES (LAE).  OUR LOSS RESERVES REFLECT ESTIMATES OF TOTAL LOSSES AND LAE WE

WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE TO PAY UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES, SURETY BONDS AND

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS.  THE RESERVES

FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 COVER CLAIMS THAT WERE INCURRED

NOT ONLY IN 2002 BUT ALSO IN PRIOR YEARS.

THEY INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL COST OF CLAIMS THAT HAVE ALREADY

BEEN REPORTED BUT NOT YET SETTLED (CASE RESERVES), AND THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN

INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED (IBNR RESERVES).  LOSS RESERVES ARE REDUCED FOR ESTIMATES OF SALVAGE AND

SUBROGATION.

LOSS RESERVES FOR TABULAR

WORKERS COMPENSATION BUSINESS AND CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE

DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT VALUE.  ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ABOUT THESE DISCOUNTED LIABILITIES IS SET FORTH IN NOTE 1 TO OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ON PAGES 63 THROUGH 67 OF OUR 2002

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  DURING 2002, $14 MILLION OF DISCOUNT WAS

AMORTIZED AND $3 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT WAS ACCRUED.

BECAUSE MANY OF THE

COVERAGES WE OFFER INVOLVE CLAIMS THAT MAY NOT ULTIMATELY BE SETTLED FOR MANY

YEARS AFTER THEY ARE INCURRED, SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AS TO OUR ULTIMATE EXPOSURE

TO LOSSES ARE AN INTEGRAL AND NECESSARY COMPONENT OF OUR LOSS RESERVING

PROCESS.  WE RECORD OUR RESERVES BY

CONSIDERING A RANGE OF ESTIMATES BOUNDED BY A HIGH AND LOW POINT.  WITHIN THAT RANGE, WE RECORD OUR BEST

ESTIMATE.  WE CONTINUALLY REVIEW OUR

RESERVES, USING A VARIETY OF STATISTICAL AND ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES TO ANALYZE

CURRENT CLAIM COSTS, FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY DATA, AND PREVAILING ECONOMIC,

SOCIAL AND LEGAL FACTORS.  WE ADJUST

RESERVES ESTABLISHED IN PRIOR YEARS AS LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND NEW

INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED RESERVES ARE REFLECTED IN RESULTS IN

THE YEAR IN WHICH THEY ARE MADE.

WHILE

WE BELIEVE OUR REPORTED RESERVES MAKE A REASONABLE PROVISION FOR ALL OF OUR

UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE OBLIGATIONS, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT

THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING REQUIRED RESERVES DOES, BY ITS VERY NATURE, INVOLVE

UNCERTAINTY.  THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY

CAN BE INFLUENCED BY SUCH FACTORS AS THE EXISTENCE OF LONG-TAIL COVERAGES

(WHICH WE CONSIDER TO BE BUSINESS IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF COVERAGES INVOLVE

AVERAGE LOSS PAYMENT LAGS OF THREE YEARS OR MORE BEYOND THE EXPIRATION OF THE

POLICY), AND CHANGES IN CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES.  MANY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN LONG-TAIL

COVERAGES, AND THE PRIMARY LINES OF BUSINESS FITTING THAT CRITERION ARE GENERAL

LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION AND CASUALTY EXCESS REINSURANCE.  IN ADDITION, CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES CHANGE

AND EVOLVE OVER THE YEARS.  FOR EXAMPLE,

NEW INITIATIVES ARE COMMENCED, CLAIM OFFICES ARE REORGANIZED AND RELOCATED,

CLAIM HANDLING RESPONSIBILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL ADJUSTERS ARE CHANGED, USE OF A

CALL CENTER IS INCREASED, USE OF TECHNOLOGY IS INCREASED, CASELOAD ISSUES AND

CASE RESERVING PRACTICES ARE MONITORED MORE FREQUENTLY, ETC.  FURTHERMORE, ESTABLISHING RESERVES FOR OUR

REINSURANCE AND RETROCESSIONAL BUSINESS IS INFLUENCED BY OUR NEED TO RELY ON

THE CEDING INSURERS AND REINSURERS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING REPORTED CLAIMS.  HOWEVER, ALL OF THE ABOVE FACTORS ARE

SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY THAT WE HAVE RECOGNIZED IN ESTABLISHING OUR RESERVES.

THE LOSS AND LOSS

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

INCLUDED IN OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDES MORE INFORMATION

ABOUT OUR LOSS RESERVES, INCLUDING AN ANALYSIS OF OUR LONG-TAIL EXPOSURES, AND

IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS FORM 10-K AT ITEM 7.

TEN-YEAR DEVELOPMENT.

THE TABLE ON PAGE 18 PRESENTS A DEVELOPMENT

OF NET LOSS AND LAE RESERVE LIABILITIES AND PAYMENTS FOR THE YEARS 1992 THROUGH

2002.  THE TOP LINE ON THE TABLE SHOWS

THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE, NET OF REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES, RECORDED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE FOR EACH OF THE YEARS

INDICATED.

THE TABLE EXCLUDES THE

RESERVES AND ACTIVITY OF ECONOMY FIRE AND CASUALTY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

(ECONOMY), WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN THE SALE OF OUR STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCE

OPERATIONS TO METROPOLITAN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY

(METROPOLITAN) IN 1999.  THE TABLE

DOES, HOWEVER, INCLUDE RESERVES AND ACTIVITY FOR THE NON-ECONOMY STANDARD

PERSONAL INSURANCE BUSINESS THAT WAS SOLD TO METROPOLITAN, SINCE WE REMAIN

LIABLE FOR CLAIMS ON NON-ECONOMY STANDARD PERSONAL INSURANCE POLICIES THAT

RESULT FROM LOSSES OCCURRING PRIOR TO SEPT. 30, 1999 (THE CLOSING DATE OF THE

SALE).  NOTE 16 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE SALE

OF ECONOMY AND THE RELATED RESERVES, IS INCLUDED ON PAGES 81 AND 82 OF OUR 2002

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

WHEN WE ACQUIRE AN

INSURANCE UNDERWRITING COMPANY, WE INCLUDE LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR THE ACQUIRED

COMPANY IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE BEGINNING WITH THE DATE OF ACQUISITION; HOWEVER,

THAT DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES ACTIVITY FROM PERIODS PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION.

IN 1997, WE CHANGED THE

METHOD BY WHICH WE ASSIGN LOSS ACTIVITY TO A PARTICULAR YEAR FOR ASSUMED

REINSURANCE WRITTEN BY OUR U.K.-BASED REINSURANCE OPERATION, WHICH, AS NOTED

ABOVE, IS NOW IN RUNOFF.  PRIOR TO 1997,

THAT LOSS ACTIVITY WAS ASSIGNED TO THE YEAR IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING REINSURANCE

CONTRACT WAS WRITTEN.  IN 1997, OUR

ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT AN EXCESS AMOUNT OF LOSS ACTIVITY WAS BEING ASSIGNED TO

PRIOR YEARS BECAUSE OF THIS PRACTICE.

AS A RESULT, WE IMPLEMENTED AN IMPROVED PROCEDURE IN 1997 THAT MORE

ACCURATELY ASSIGNS LOSS ACTIVITY FOR THIS BUSINESS TO THE YEAR IN WHICH IT

OCCURRED.  THIS CHANGE HAD THE IMPACT OF

INCREASING FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT ON PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES BY

APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION IN 1997.

THERE WAS NO NET IMPACT ON TOTAL INCURRED LOSSES, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THERE

WAS A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CURRENT YEAR LOSS ACTIVITY IN

1997.  DEVELOPMENT DATA FOR INDIVIDUAL

YEARS PRIOR TO 1997 IN THIS TABLE WERE NOT RESTATED TO REFLECT THIS NEW

PROCEDURE BECAUSE RELIABLE DATA TO DO SO WAS NOT AVAILABLE.

THE UPPER PORTION OF THE

TABLE, WHICH SHOWS THE RE-ESTIMATED AMOUNTS RELATING TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED

LIABILITIES, IS BASED UPON EXPERIENCE AS OF THE END OF EACH SUCCEEDING

YEAR.  THESE ESTIMATES ARE EITHER

INCREASED OR DECREASED AS FURTHER INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN ABOUT INDIVIDUAL

CLAIMS AND AS CHANGES IN THE TREND OF CLAIM FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY BECOME

APPARENT.

THE CUMULATIVE

REDUNDANCY (DEFICIENCY) LINE ON THE TABLE FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR REPRESENTS THE

AGGREGATE CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATES FOR ALL YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO THE YEAR THE

RESERVES WERE INITIALLY ESTABLISHED.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE 1993 NET RESERVE OF $12,970 MILLION DEVELOPED TO

$12,227 MILLION, OR A $743 MILLION REDUNDANCY, BY THE END OF 1995.  BY THE END OF 2002, THE 1993 RESERVE HAD

DEVELOPED A REDUNDANCY OF $1,883 MILLION.

THE CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE OF 1993 LOSS RESERVES WERE REFLECTED IN

OPERATIONS DURING THE PAST NINE YEARS.

LIKEWISE, THE DEFICIENCY THAT DEVELOPED WITH RESPECT TO YEAR-END 2000

RESERVES (PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR MEDICAL LIABILITY BUSINESS) WAS REFLECTED IN

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2002 AND 2001.

IN 1993, WE ADOPTED THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 113, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR REINSURANCE OF

SHORT-DURATION AND LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS.

THIS STATEMENT REQUIRED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

ON UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE BE SHOWN AS AN ASSET, INSTEAD OF THE PRIOR PRACTICE OF

NETTING THIS AMOUNT AGAINST INSURANCE RESERVES FOR BALANCE SHEET REPORTING

PURPOSES.

THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE

TABLE REPRESENTS A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE NET RESERVE LIABILITY AS SHOWN ON

THE TOP LINE OF THE TABLE AND THE GROSS RESERVE LIABILITY AS SHOWN ON OUR

BALANCE SHEET.  THIS PORTION OF THE

TABLE ALSO PRESENTS THE GROSS RE-ESTIMATED RESERVE LIABILITY AS OF THE END OF

THE LATEST RE-ESTIMATION PERIOD (DECEMBER 31, 2002) AND THE RELATED

RE-ESTIMATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE.

THE LOWER PORTION OF THE

TABLE PRESENTS THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID WITH RESPECT TO THE PREVIOUSLY

RECORDED LIABILITY AS OF THE END OF EACH SUCCEEDING YEAR.  FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, $8,976

MILLION OF THE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED $11,087 MILLION OF NET LOSSES AND LAE THAT

HAVE BEEN INCURRED FOR THE YEARS UP TO AND INCLUDING 1993 HAVE BEEN PAID.  THUS, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, IT IS

ESTIMATED THAT $2,111 MILLION OF NET INCURRED LOSSES AND LAE HAVE YET TO BE

PAID FOR THE YEARS UP TO AND INCLUDING 1993.

16

CAUTION SHOULD BE

EXERCISED IN EVALUATING THE INFORMATION SHOWN IN THIS TABLE.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EACH AMOUNT INCLUDES

THE EFFECTS OF ALL CHANGES IN AMOUNTS FOR PRIOR PERIODS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE PORTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT

SHOWN FOR YEAR-END 1998 RESERVES THAT RELATES TO 1993 LOSSES IS INCLUDED IN THE

CUMULATIVE REDUNDANCY (DEFICIENCY) FOR THE YEARS 1993 THROUGH 1998.

IN ADDITION, THE TABLE

PRESENTS CALENDAR YEAR DATA.  IT DOES

NOT PRESENT ACCIDENT OR POLICY YEAR DEVELOPMENT DATA, WHICH SOME READERS MAY BE

MORE ACCUSTOMED TO ANALYZING.  THE

SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL CONDITIONS AND OTHER TRENDS WHICH HAVE HAD AN IMPACT

ON THE CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN THE PAST ARE NOT NECESSARILY

INDICATIVE OF THE FUTURE.  ACCORDINGLY,

READERS ARE CAUTIONED AGAINST EXTRAPOLATING ANY CONCLUSIONS ABOUT FUTURE

RESULTS FROM THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS TABLE.

NOTE 11 TO OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ON PAGES 74 AND 75 OF OUR 2002

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS CONTAINS A RECONCILIATION OF BEGINNING AND ENDING

LOSS RESERVE LIABILITIES FOR EACH OF THE YEARS 2002, 2001 AND 2000, AND IS

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

THE TABLE SHOWS THAT A

CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY OF $1,505 MILLION HAD DEVELOPED ON YEAR-END 2000 NET

RESERVES BY THE END OF 2002.  THE

PRIMARY CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT WERE THE $735 MILLION OF

PRIOR-YEAR LOSS PROVISIONS RECORDED IN 2001 RELATED TO MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

COVERAGES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SEGMENT, $217 MILLION OF ADVERSE PRIOR-YEAR LOSS

DEVELOPMENT IN OUR SURETY & CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT RECORDED IN 2002, AND THE

$472 MILLION PROVISION RECORDED IN OUR COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENT IN 2002 RELATED

TO THE WESTERN MACARTHUR ASBESTOS LITIGATION SETTLEMENT.

REINSURANCE

WHEN WE PURCHASE

REINSURANCE OR CEDE INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND RISKS, OTHER INSURERS OR

REINSURERS AGREE TO SHARE CERTAIN RISKS THAT WE HAVE UNDERWRITTEN.  THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF REINSURANCE IS TO

LIMIT A CEDING INSURERS MAXIMUM NET LOSS FROM INDIVIDUALLY LARGE OR AGGREGATE

RISKS AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST CATASTROPHES.  OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM IS GENERALLY MANAGED

FROM A CORPORATE RISK-TOLERANCE PERSPECTIVE.

REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ADDRESSING SPECIFIC BUSINESS CENTER RISKS ARE

UTILIZED ON A LIMITED BASIS TO COVER UNIQUE EXPOSURES AS NECESSARY.  OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM ADDRESSES RISK

THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PER-RISK REINSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS

PROTECTING AGAINST THE AGGREGATION OF RISK EXPOSURES.  FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE, WHICH COVERS SPECIFIC RISKS, IS ALSO

USED TO SUPPLEMENT OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAM.

IN THE WAKE OF THE

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACK, PRICE INCREASES AND PRESSURES ON CONTRACT

TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTINUE IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET.  DESPITE THESE CONSTRAINTS, OUR REINSURANCE

PROGRAM CONTINUES TO SUPPORT OUR PRIMARY UNDERWRITING REINSURANCE NEEDS,

PARTICULARLY AS INCREASES IN RATES AND REDUCTIONS IN LIMITS ALSO CONTINUE IN

THE REINSURANCE MARKET.

AFTER THE TERRORIST

ATTACK, REINSURERS, IN GENERAL, SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED TERRORISM COVERAGE FROM

PROPERTY REINSURANCE TREATIES THAT SUBSEQUENTLY RENEWED.  AS A RESULT, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002,

WE PURCHASED LIMITED SPECIFIC TERRORISM COVERAGE IN THE FORM OF TWO SEPARATE

PROPERTY REINSURANCE TREATIES  A PER-RISK TERRORISM TREATY AND A CATASTROPHE

TERRORISM TREATY.  THE PER-RISK TREATY

PROVIDES COVERAGE ON A PER-BUILDING, PER-EVENT BASIS FOR A LOSS OF UP TO $110

MILLION, AFTER A FIRST LAYER OF $15 MILLION OF LOSSES RETAINED BY US.  THE CATASTROPHE TERRORISM TREATY PROVIDES

COVERAGE OF UP TO $200 MILLION IN EXCESS OF THE FIRST $100 MILLION OF LOSSES

RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHIC LOSSES CAUSED BY TERRORISM.  BOTH TREATIES HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL SET OF

LIMITS FOR SUBSEQUENT TERRORISM EVENTS AND EXPIRE IN APRIL 2003.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RENEWED THE MAJORITY OF

OUR REINSURANCE TREATIES COVERING WORKERS COMPENSATION AND GENERAL LIABILITY

BUSINESS.  THUS FAR, THOSE RENEWALS

INCLUDED COVERAGE FOR TERRORISM.  OUR

REINSURANCE TREATIES DO NOT COVER ACTS OF TERRORISM INVOLVING NUCLEAR,

BIOLOGICAL OR CHEMICAL EVENTS.

WE HAVE NOT DETERMINED

WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO RENEW OUR TERRORISM PROPERTY REINSURANCE TREATIES UPON

THEIR EXPIRATION IN APRIL 2003, AND, IN ANY EVENT, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SECURE SUCH TERRORISM REINSURANCE COVERAGE WITH

ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, AT THAT TIME.

APPROXIMATELY 98% OF OUR

DOMESTIC REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 WERE WITH

REINSURANCE COMPANIES HAVING FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS OF A- OR HIGHER BY A.M

BEST OR STANDARD & POORS, WERE FROM STATE SPONSORED FACILITIES OR

REINSURANCE POOLS, OR WERE COLLATERALIZED REINSURANCE PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED WITH

CERTAIN OF OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS.  WE

HAVE AN INTERNAL CREDIT SECURITY COMMITTEE, WHICH USES A COMPREHENSIVE CREDIT

RISK REVIEW PROCESS IN SELECTING OUR REINSURERS.  THIS PROCESS CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS RATINGS BY MAJOR RATINGS

AGENCIES, FINANCIAL CONDITION, PARENTAL SUPPORT, OPERATING PRACTICES, AND

MARKET NEWS AND DEVELOPMENTS.  THE

CREDIT SECURITY COMMITTEE CONVENES QUARTERLY TO EVALUATE THESE FACTORS AND TAKE

ACTION ON OUR APPROVED LIST OF REINSURERS, AS NECESSARY.

WE MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE

FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE, WHICH IS EVALUATED AND ADJUSTED ON A REGULAR

BASIS TO REFLECT DISPUTED COVERAGES AND CHANGING MARKET AND CREDIT

CONDITIONS.  OUR ALLOWANCE FOR

UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REINSURANCE RECOVERABLE

BALANCES WAS 1.5% AND 1.6% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.  HISTORICALLY, OUR WRITE-OFFS OF

UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE BALANCES HAVE AVERAGED LESS THAN $3 MILLION PER YEAR.

IN 2000 AND 2001, WE

ENTERED INTO TWO AGGREGATE EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE TREATIES.  ONE OF THESE TREATIES IN EACH YEAR WAS

CORPORATE-WIDE, WITH COVERAGE TRIGGERED WHEN OUR INSURANCE LOSSES AND LAE

ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS REACHED A CERTAIN LEVEL, AS PRESCRIBED BY TERMS OF

THE TREATY (THE CORPORATE PROGRAM).

WE WERE NOT PARTY TO SUCH A TREATY IN 2002.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR REINSURANCE SEGMENT WAS IMPACTED BY CESSIONS

MADE UNDER A SEPARATE TREATY IN THOSE YEARS AND 2002 UNRELATED TO THE CORPORATE

TREATY. THE COMBINED IMPACT OF THESE TREATIES (TOGETHER, THE REINSURANCE

TREATIES) IS INCLUDED IN THE TABLE THAT FOLLOWS.

UNTIL THE TRANSFER OF OUR

ONGOING REINSURANCE OPERATIONS TO PLATINUM IN NOVEMBER 2002, WE UNDERWROTE

ASSUMED REINSURANCE COVERAGES ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS.  WE REMAIN LIABLE ON ALL REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH INCEPTION

DATES PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2002, AS WELL AS ON CERTAIN 2002 CONTRACTS THAT WERE

NOT TRANSFERRED TO PLATINUM.

PROPERTY - LIABILITY INVESTMENT

OPERATIONS

OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS

APPROVES THE OVERALL INVESTMENT PLAN FOR THE COMPANIES WITHIN THE ST. PAULS

PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONS.  EACH

SUBSIDIARY DEVELOPS ITS OWN SPECIFIC INVESTMENT POLICY TAILORED TO COMPLY WITH

DOMESTIC LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THE OVERALL CORPORATE INVESTMENT PLAN.  THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THOSE PLANS ARE TO

ENSURE OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF INSURANCE

CLAIM PAYMENTS, AND, HAVING DONE THAT, TO INCREASE OUR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

THE MAJORITY OF FUNDS

AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF

PREDOMINANTLY INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF

GOVERNMENT-ISSUED SECURITIES AND CORPORATE BONDS.  WE ALSO INVEST MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, VENTURE

CAPITAL AND REAL ESTATE.  THE LATTER

THREE INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT ALSO INVOLVE

VARYING DEGREES OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND LESS

LIQUIDITY.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ON

EACH OF OUR INVESTED ASSET CLASSES.

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES.

OUR PORTFOLIO OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES

CONSTITUTED 75% (AT COST) OF OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THE PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF HIGH-QUALITY, INTERMEDIATE-TERM

TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, CORPORATE AND MORTGAGE-BACKED

BONDS, AND TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS.

MAINTAIN FULL OWNERSHIP RIGHTS TO THE SECURITIES LOANED, AND CONTINUE TO EARN

INTEREST ON THEM.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE

THE ABILITY TO SELL THE SECURITIES WHILE THEY ARE ON LOAN.  WE HAVE AN INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT WITH

THE LENDING AGENTS IN THE EVENT A BORROWER BECOMES INSOLVENT OR FAILS TO RETURN

ARE INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND ARE REPORTED ON THE BALANCE

SHEET.  WE SHARE A PORTION OF THE

INTEREST EARNED ON THESE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH THE LENDING AGENT.  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES ON LOAN IS

REMOVED FROM FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND SHOWN AS A

SEPARATE INVESTMENT ASSET.

20

OUR DECISION WHETHER TO

PURCHASE TAXABLE OR TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES IS DRIVEN BY CORPORATE TAX

CONSIDERATIONS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT YIELDS AT

THE TIME OF PURCHASE.  IN RECENT YEARS,

THE AVAILABILITY OF CORPORATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND ALTERNATIVE

MINIMUM TAX CARRYFORWARDS HAS INCREASED OUR ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM TAXABLE

INVESTMENT INCOME.  ACCORDINGLY, A

SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF OUR NEW FIXED INCOME PURCHASES IN RECENT YEARS HAVE

CONSISTED OF TAXABLE BONDS.  WE CARRY

OUR FIXED MATURITIES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, WITH

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION AND DEPRECIATION (NET OF TAXES) RECORDED IN COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

WE MANAGE OUR BOND

PORTFOLIO CONSERVATIVELY TO PROVIDE REASONABLE RETURNS WHILE LIMITING EXPOSURE

TO RISKS.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2002,

APPROXIMATELY 97% OF OUR FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO, COMPRISED OF OUR FIXED INCOME

SECURITIES AS WELL AS THE SECURITIES ON LOAN AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WAS

RATED INVESTMENT GRADE.  THE REMAINING

3% OF THIS FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF HIGH-YIELD BONDS, AND

ALSO INCLUDED NON-RATED SECURITIES, MOST OF WHICH WE BELIEVE WOULD BE

CONSIDERED INVESTMENT-GRADE, IF RATED.

REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE LOANS

.  OUR REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS CONSIST OF A

DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND WAREHOUSE PROPERTIES THAT WE OWN

DIRECTLY OR HAVE PARTIAL INTEREST IN THROUGH JOINT VENTURES.  THE PROPERTIES ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY

DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND HAD AN OVERALL OCCUPANCY RATE OF

90% AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.  WE ALSO HAVE

A PORTFOLIO OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED IN OUR MERGER WITH

USF&G CORPORATION IN 1998.  THE REAL

ESTATE AND MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO PRODUCED $77 MILLION OF PRETAX INVESTMENT

INCOME IN 2002 AND GENERATED $2 MILLION OF PRETAX REALIZED GAINS.

VENTURE CAPITAL

.  SECURITIES OF SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES SPANNING A VARIETY

OF INDUSTRIES COMPRISE OUR VENTURE CAPITAL HOLDINGS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 3% OF

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS (AT COST) AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.  VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS GENERATED PRETAX

REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES OF $200 MILLION IN 2002, DRIVEN BY IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS

IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND THE SALE OF THE

MAJORITY OF OUR PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENT HOLDINGS.  THE CARRYING $581 MILLION VALUE OF VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002 INCLUDED $4 MILLION OF PRETAX UNREALIZED APPRECIATION.

EQUITIES.

OUR EQUITY HOLDINGS CONSIST OF A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF PUBLIC COMMON

STOCK, COMPRISING 2% OF TOTAL PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS (AT COST) AT

YEAR-END 2002.  IN MAY AND JUNE 2002, WE

REDUCED OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS BY $445 MILLION, OR 46% OF THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING

AT THE TIME (AT COST), AT A MARKET LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT WHICH PREVAILED FOR

THE REMAINDER OF 2002.  OUR DECISION TO

REDUCE OUR PUBLIC EQUITY HOLDINGS WAS PROMPTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

OUR OPINION AS TO THE NEAR-TERM DIRECTION OF EQUITY PRICES, A COMPREHENSIVE

EVALUATION OF OUR AGGREGATE EQUITY EXPOSURE (INCLUDING VENTURE CAPITAL AND

EQUITIES HELD BY OUR PENSION FUND), AND OUR OPINION AS TO THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC

EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLICLY HELD INSURANCE COMPANIES.  BY THE END OF 2002, WE HAD REDUCED OUR

EQUITY INVESTMENTS BY $683 MILLION (AT COST) SINCE YEAR-END 2001.

SHORT-TERM AND OTHER INVESTMENTS.

OUR PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDES SHORT-TERM

SECURITIES AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING OUR 14% EQUITY

OWNERSHIP STAKE IN PLATINUM AND OUR WARRANTS TO PURCHASE UP TO SIX MILLION

ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES OF PLATINUM), WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE COMPRISED 13% OF

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.  ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 WAS AN

APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION LONG-TERM INTEREST-BEARING SECURITY FROM A HIGHLY

RATED ENTITY, SUPPORTING A SERIES OF INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.

DERIVATIVES.

OUR PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT OPERATIONS HAVE HAD LIMITED

INVOLVEMENT WITH DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY FOR PURPOSES OF

HEDGING AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST

RATES.  EFFECTIVE JANUARY. 1, 2001, WE

ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED,

WHICH REQUIRED THE RECOGNITION OF ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS

OR LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

NOTE 10 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 73 OF OUR 2002

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE

IMPACT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 133, IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

IN ADDITION TO NOTE 10,

NOTES 1, 8 AND 9 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED

IN OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  THE PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT

OPERATIONS ON PAGES 44 THROUGH 46 AND EXPOSURES TO MARKET RISK SECTIONS OF

ASSET MANAGEMENT

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, INC.

(NUVEEN INVESTMENTS, FORMERLY THE JOHN NUVEEN COMPANY) IS OUR ASSET

MANAGEMENT SUBSIDIARY.  THE ST. PAUL AND

ITS LARGEST PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY, FIRE AND MARINE) HOLD A

COMBINED 79% INTEREST IN NUVEEN INVESTMENTS.

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS CORE

BUSINESSES ARE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND RELATED RESEARCH, AS WELL AS THE

DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR

THE AFFLUENT, HIGH NET WORTH AND INSTITUTIONAL MARKET SEGMENTS.  NUVEEN INVESTMENTS DISTRIBUTES ITS

BROKER/DEALERS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, AFFILIATES OF INSURANCE PROVIDERS, FINANCIAL

PLANNERS, ACCOUNTANTS, CONSULTANTS AND INVESTMENT ADVISORS.  NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ALSO PROVIDES MANAGED

ACCOUNT SERVICES TO SEVERAL INSTITUTIONAL MARKET SEGMENTS AND CHANNELS.

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

FUNDS, SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND MUTUAL FUNDS; (2) UNDERWRITING AND

DISTRIBUTION REVENUES EARNED UPON THE SALE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND (3)

PERFORMANCE FEES EARNED ON CERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE

PERFORMANCE OF SUCH ACCOUNTS.  ADVISORY

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

OPERATIONS ARE CARRIED ON BY ELEVEN SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

LLC (FORMERLY NUVEEN INVESTMENTS), A REGISTERED BROKER AND DEALER IN SECURITIES

UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND EIGHT INVESTMENT ADVISORY

SUBSIDIARIES REGISTERED UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940.  THE EIGHT INVESTMENT ADVISORY SUBSIDIARIES

SUB-ADVISER AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER FOR MUTUAL FUNDS MANAGED BY NIAC.  THE OTHER TWO SUBSIDIARIES ARE NOT

REGISTERED BROKER-DEALERS OR INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND DO NOT PROVIDE PRODUCT

DISTRIBUTION OR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR THE COMPANY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002,

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT TOTALED $79.7 BILLION, CONSISTING

OF $39.9 BILLION OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, $19.4 BILLION OF RETAIL MANAGED

ACCOUNTS, $8.5 BILLION OF INSTITUTIONAL MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND $11.9 BILLION OF

MUTUAL FUNDS.

COMPETITION

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE

THE PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE AREAS OF PRICE, SERVICE,

PRODUCT OFFERINGS, TECHNOLOGY AND AGENT RELATIONSHIPS.  RATINGS ISSUED BY INDEPENDENT RATINGS

AGENCIES ARE ALSO A COMPETITIVE FACTOR IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS.  INCREASING THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE IS THE

CURRENT LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS IMPACTING INVESTMENT RETURNS AND

MAKING UNDERWRITING DECISIONS EVEN MORE CRITICAL.  OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE

WITH OTHER STOCK COMPANIES, MUTUAL COMPANIES, ALTERNATIVE RISK SHARING GROUPS

AND OTHER UNDERWRITING ORGANIZATIONS.

COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY-LIABILITY

INSURANCE COMPANIES WILLING TO WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL

PRODUCTS AND PRICING AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

COMPANIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED NICHE PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.  IN ADDITION, MANY LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS

SELF-INSURE THEIR RISKS OR UTILIZE LARGE DEDUCTIBLES ON PURCHASED

INSURANCE.  THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY

3,400 PROPERTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES OPERATING

INDEPENDENTLY OR IN GROUPS, AND NO SINGLE COMPANY OR GROUP IS DOMINANT.  ACCORDING TO A.M. BEST, WE ARE THE

FOURTH-LARGEST UNITED STATES

22

COMMERCIAL LINES PROPERTY

AND LIABILITY INSURANCE GROUP BASED ON 2001 DIRECT PREMIUMS WRITTEN.  SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE LARGER AND HAVE

GREATER ACCESS TO CAPITAL.  IN VARIOUS

MARKETS, WE ALSO COMPETE BASED ON RATINGS AND SEVERAL OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE

HIGHER RATED.

IN ADDITION, THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN GENERAL CONTINUES TO BE AFFECTED BY AN

INTENSIFYING COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AS DEMONSTRATED BY CONSOLIDATION THROUGH

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND COMPETITION FROM NEW ENTRANTS, AS WELL AS

ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE INTERNET, TO

ESTABLISH OR EXPAND THEIR BUSINESSES.

THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT, PASSED IN 1999, WHICH REPEALED U.S. LAWS

THAT SEPARATED COMMERCIAL BANKING, INVESTMENT BANKING AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES,

TOGETHER WITH CHANGES TO THE INDUSTRY RESULTING FROM PREVIOUS REFORMS, HAS

INCREASED THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES COMPETING FOR A SIMILAR CUSTOMER BASE.

OUR COMPETITORS IN THE

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL AND COMMERCIAL LINES SEGMENTS INCLUDE AMERICAN

INTERNATIONAL GROUP, THE CHUBB CORPORATION, CNA FINANCIAL CORPORATION, HARTFORD

INSURANCE GROUP, SAFECO CORPORATION AND TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP.

OUR COMPETITORS IN THE

SURETY & CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT INCLUDE CNA SURETY CORPORATION, AMERICAN

INTERNATIONAL GROUP, TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., AND ZURICH NORTH

AMERICA.  IN OUR INTERNATIONAL AND

LLOYDS SEGMENT, OUR INTERNATIONAL SPECIALTIES COMPETE WITH NUMEROUS INSURERS

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND IRELAND WHILE COMPETITORS IN LLOYDS MARKETS

IN WHICH WE ARE ACTIVE INCLUDE VARIOUS INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER MEMBERS OF

LLOYDS.

OUR SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE

PRINCIPALLY BY ATTEMPTING TO OFFER A COMBINATION OF SUPERIOR PRODUCTS,

UNDERWRITING EXPERTISE AND SERVICES AT A COMPETITIVE, YET PROFITABLE,

PRICE.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR RELATIVELY

LARGE SIZE AND UNDERWRITING CAPACITY PROVIDE US WITH OPPORTUNITIES NOT AVAILABLE

TO SMALLER COMPANIES.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS IS

SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN ALL ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS.  THE REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES THAT

DISTRIBUTE NUVEEN INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ALSO DISTRIBUTE NUMEROUS

COMPETING PRODUCTS, OFTEN INCLUDING PRODUCTS SPONSORED BY THE RETAIL

DISTRIBUTION FIRMS WHERE THEY ARE EMPLOYED.

THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR NEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

FIRMS.  NUVEEN INVESTMENTS MANAGED

ACCOUNT BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM OTHER

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS SEEKING TO BE APPROVED AS MANAGERS IN THE VARIOUS

WRAP-FEE PROGRAMS.  THE SPONSOR FIRMS

HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF APPROVED MANAGERS AT THE HIGHEST AND MOST ATTRACTIVE

LEVELS OF THEIR PROGRAMS AND CLOSELY MONITOR THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF SUCH

FIRMS ON AN ON-GOING BASIS AS THEY EVALUATE WHICH FIRMS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS.

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO COMPETITION IN OBTAINING THE

COMMITMENT OF UNDERWRITERS TO UNDERWRITE ITS EXCHANGE TRADED FUND

OFFERINGS.  TO THE EXTENT THE INCREASED

COMPETITION FOR UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION CAUSES HIGH DISTRIBUTION COSTS,

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS NET REVENUE AND EARNINGS WILL BE REDUCED.  INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC

BY BROKER/DEALERS, BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHERS, AND MANY COMPETING

INVESTMENT PRODUCT SPONSORS OFFER A BROADER ARRAY OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

MANY OF THESE

INSTITUTIONS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER RESOURCES THAN NUVEEN.  IN ADDITION, CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE PROLONGED SLUMP IN EQUITY MARKET

PERFORMANCE ARE ALTERING THE LANDSCAPE IN WHICH NUVEEN INVESTMENTS

DISTRIBUTORS COMPETE AND THE ECONOMICS OF MANY OF THE PRODUCTS THEY OFFER.  THE EFFECT THAT THESE CONTINUING CHANGES IN

THE BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRIES WILL HAVE ON NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS AND ITS COMPETITORS CANNOT BE PREDICTED.  NUVEEN INVESTMENTS COMPETES WITH OTHER PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS

PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS OFFERED, THE INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE OF SUCH PRODUCTS, QUALITY OF SERVICE, FEES CHARGED, THE LEVEL AND

TYPE OF BROKER COMPENSATION, THE MANNER IN WHICH SUCH PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED AND

DISTRIBUTED, AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES AND

INVESTORS.

23

REGULATION

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE

INSURANCE

HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION.

THE ST. PAUL

AND OUR DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION AS AN

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM IN STATES WHERE OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

DOMICILED, WHICH CURRENTLY INCLUDE MINNESOTA, MARYLAND, WISCONSIN, NORTH

DAKOTA, MISSISSIPPI, IOWA, ILLINOIS, CALIFORNIA, DELAWARE, INDIANA, VERMONT AND

NEW YORK.  SUCH REGULATION GENERALLY

PROVIDES THAT TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN COMPANIES WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM

MUST BE FAIR AND EQUITABLE.  TRANSFERS

OF ASSETS AMONG SUCH AFFILIATED COMPANIES, CERTAIN DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FROM

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN COMPANIES

WITHIN THE SYSTEM MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRIOR NOTICE TO, OR PRIOR APPROVAL BY,

STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.  SUCH

REGULATIONS ALSO REQUIRE THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARY TO REGISTER WITH THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT IN THE INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARYS STATE OF DOMICILE AND TO FURNISH ANNUALLY FINANCIAL AND OTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPERATIONS OF COMPANIES WITHIN THE HOLDING COMPANY

SYSTEM.

PAYMENT

OF DIVIDENDS.

FIRE

AND MARINE IS OUR LEAD U.S. PROPERTY-LIABILITY UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARY, AND ITS

DIVIDEND PAYING CAPACITY IS REGULATED BY THE LAWS OF MINNESOTA, ITS STATE OF

DOMICILE.  MINNESOTA INSURANCE LAW

PROVIDES THAT, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS,

ALL DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS PAID BY FIRE AND MARINE MAY BE DECLARED OR PAID

ONLY FROM EARNED SURPLUS, OR UNASSIGNED FUNDS, AS DETERMINED PURSUANT TO

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, FIRE AND MARINES EARNED SURPLUS WAS $2.0 BILLION.  FIRE AND MARINE ALSO MUST NOTIFY THE MINNESOTA

INSURANCE REGULATOR OF ITS INTENT TO PAY A DIVIDEND IF THE DIVIDEND, TOGETHER

WITH OTHER DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS,

WOULD EXCEED A SPECIFIED STATUTORY LIMIT, AND MAY NOT PAY SUCH DIVIDEND UNTIL

EITHER 30 DAYS AFTER THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE REGULATOR HAS RECEIVED NOTICE OF

IT AND HAS NOT WITHIN THAT PERIOD DISAPPROVED IT, OR THE REGULATOR HAS APPROVED

THE PAYMENT.  THE CURRENT STATUTORY

LIMITATION APPLICABLE TO MINNESOTA PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURERS GENERALLY IS THE

GREATER OF.

(1)

10%

OF SUCH INSURERS SURPLUS AS REGARDS POLICYHOLDERS AS OF THE DECEMBER 31 NEXT

PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE PROPOSED DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION; OR

(2)

THE

NET INCOME OF SUCH INSURER, NOT INCLUDING REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS, FOR THE 12-MONTH

PERIOD ENDING THE DECEMBER 31 NEXT PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE PROPOSED DIVIDEND

OR DISTRIBUTION,

IN EACH CASE DETERMINED

UNDER STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DIFFER FROM GAAP PRIMARILY IN RELATION

TO DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS, DEFERRED TAXES AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS,

AND RESERVE CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS. THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE REGULATOR IS ALSO

REQUIRED TO REVIEW AT LEAST ANNUALLY THE DIVIDENDS PAID BY A MINNESOTA DOMESTIC

INSURER TO DETERMINE IF THE DIVIDENDS ARE REASONABLE BASED UPON (1) THE

ADEQUACY OF SURPLUS AS REGARDS POLICYHOLDERS REMAINING AFTER THE DIVIDEND

PAYMENTS AND (2) THE QUALITY OF THE INSURERS EARNINGS AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE

REQUIRED EARNINGS INCLUDE EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS.

OTHER STATES AND FOREIGN

JURISDICTIONS HAVE SIMILAR REGULATIONS TO THOSE OF MINNESOTA THAT AFFECT THE

ABILITY OF OUR OTHER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, MOST OF WHICH ARE SUBSIDIARIES OF

FIRE AND MARINE, TO PAY DIVIDENDS.  THE

LAWS REGULATING DIVIDENDS OF THE OTHER STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WHERE

OUR OTHER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED ARE SIMILAR, BUT NOT IDENTICAL,

TO MINNESOTAS, AND MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE.

IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE HELD BY OTHER

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, AND ONLY INDIRECTLY BY US.  THEREFORE, THE ABILITY OF THESE INDIRECTLY-HELD SUBSIDIARIES TO

PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR DIRECT PARENTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE THESE

DIVIDENDS FROM THOSE INTERMEDIATE SUBSIDIARIES, WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE

RESPECTIVE ABILITY OF ALL SUCH SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET FINANCIAL AND REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THEM.

DURING 2002, WE RECEIVED

NO CASH DIVIDENDS FROM OUR U.S. INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. ALTHOUGH $505 MILLION

WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DIVIDENDS IN 2003 WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL, BUSINESS

AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS MAY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS ACTUALLY PAID.

24

CHANGE

OF CONTROL.

MOST

STATES, INCLUDING THE STATES IN WHICH OUR DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

DOMICILED, HAVE INSURANCE LAWS THAT REQUIRE REGULATORY APPROVAL OF A CHANGE OF

CONTROL OF AN INSURER OR AN INSURERS HOLDING COMPANY.  LAWS SUCH AS THESE THAT APPLY TO US PREVENT

ANY PERSON FROM ACQUIRING CONTROL OF THE ST. PAUL OR OF OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THAT PERSON HAS FILED A STATEMENT WITH SPECIFIED

INFORMATION WITH THE INSURANCE REGULATORS AND HAS OBTAINED THEIR PRIOR

APPROVAL.  UNDER MOST STATES STATUTES,

ACQUIRING 10% OR MORE OF THE VOTING STOCK OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY OR ITS PARENT

COMPANY IS PRESUMPTIVELY CONSIDERED A CHANGE OF CONTROL, ALTHOUGH SUCH

PRESUMPTION MAY BE REBUTTED.

ACCORDINGLY, ANY PERSON WHO ACQUIRES 10% OR MORE OF THE VOTING

SECURITIES OF THE ST. PAUL WITHOUT THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE INSURANCE

REGULATORS OF THE STATES IN WHICH OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED WILL

BE IN VIOLATION OF THESE STATES LAWS AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO INJUNCTIVE ACTION

REQUIRING THE DISPOSITION OR SEIZURE OF THOSE SECURITIES BY THE RELEVANT

INSURANCE REGULATOR OR PROHIBITING THE VOTING OF THOSE SECURITIES AND TO OTHER

ACTIONS DETERMINED BY THE RELEVANT INSURANCE REGULATOR.

IN ADDITION, MANY STATE

INSURANCE LAWS REQUIRE PRIOR NOTIFICATION OF STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF A

CHANGE IN CONTROL OF A NON-DOMICILIARY INSURANCE COMPANY DOING BUSINESS IN THAT

STATE.  WHILE THESE PRE-NOTIFICATION

STATUTES DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS TO DISAPPROVE THE

CHANGE IN CONTROL, THEY AUTHORIZE REGULATORY ACTION IN THE AFFECTED STATE IF

PARTICULAR CONDITIONS EXIST SUCH AS UNDUE MARKET CONCENTRATION.  ANY FUTURE TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD

CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE ST. PAUL MAY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTIFICATION

IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED PRE-ACQUISITION NOTIFICATION LAWS.

CHANGE OF CONTROL LAWS

MAY DISCOURAGE POTENTIAL ACQUISITION PROPOSALS AND MAY DELAY, DETER OR PREVENT

A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF THE ST. PAUL, INCLUDING THROUGH TRANSACTIONS, AND IN

PARTICULAR UNSOLICITED TRANSACTIONS, THAT SOME OR ALL OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT

CONSIDER TO BE DESIRABLE.

STATE

REGULATION OF INSURANCE OPERATIONS.

OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LICENSING AND SUPERVISION BY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY

AGENCIES IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS.  THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF SUCH REGULATION

VARY BUT GENERALLY HAVE THEIR SOURCE IN STATUTES THAT DELEGATE REGULATORY,

SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS TO INSURANCE REGULATORS, WHICH IN THE

U.S. ARE STATE AUTHORITIES.  SUCH

REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES MAY

RELATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO THE STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY WHICH MUST BE MET AND

MAINTAINED; THE LICENSING OF INSURERS AND THEIR AGENTS; THE NATURE OF AND

LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS; RESTRICTIONS ON THE SIZE OF RISK WHICH MAY BE

INSURED UNDER A SINGLE POLICY; DEPOSITS OF SECURITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF

POLICYHOLDERS; REGULATION OF POLICY FORMS AND PREMIUM RATES; PERIODIC

EXAMINATION OF THE AFFAIRS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES; ANNUAL AND OTHER REPORTS

REQUIRED TO BE FILED ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INSURERS OR FOR OTHER

PURPOSES; REQUIREMENTS REGARDING RESERVES FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND

OTHER MATTERS; THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND

SHAREHOLDERS; THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF REQUIRED PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE

GUARANTY FUNDS; AND THE INVOLUNTARY ASSUMPTION OF HARD-TO-PLACE OR HIGH-RISK INSURANCE

BUSINESS, PRIMARILY IN WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE LINES.

LOSS RATIO TRENDS IN

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE UNDERWRITING EXPERIENCE MAY BE IMPROVED BY, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, CHANGING THE KINDS OF COVERAGES PROVIDED BY POLICIES, PROVIDING

LOSS PREVENTION AND RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INCREASING PREMIUM RATES,

PURCHASING REINSURANCE OR BY A COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS. THE ABILITY OF OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET EMERGING ADVERSE UNDERWRITING TRENDS MAY BE

DELAYED, FROM TIME TO TIME, BY THE EFFECTS OF LAWS WHICH REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL

BY INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OF CHANGES IN POLICY FORMS AND PREMIUM

RATES. OUR U.S. UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS DO BUSINESS IN ALL 50 STATES AND THE

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO, GUAM AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS. A NUMBER

OF THESE JURISDICTIONS REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL OF MOST OR ALL PREMIUM RATES.

RISK-BASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

IN

ORDER TO ENHANCE THE REGULATION OF INSURER SOLVENCY, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (THE NAIC) HAS ADOPTED A FORMULA AND MODEL LAW TO

IMPLEMENT RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC) REQUIREMENTS FOR MOST PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE MINIMUM CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS AND TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION THAT STATUTORY SURPLUS PROVIDES

FOR POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS.  THE RBC

FORMULA FOR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES MEASURES THREE MAJOR

AREAS OF RISK FACING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS: UNDERWRITING, WHICH

ENCOMPASSES THE RISK OF ADVERSE LOSS DEVELOPMENTS AND INADEQUATE PRICING;

DECLINES IN ASSET VALUES ARISING FROM MARKET AND/OR CREDIT RISK; AND

OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK ARISING FROM ADVERSE EXPERIENCE FROM NON-CONTROLLED

ASSETS, GUARANTEES FOR AFFILIATES OR OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND EXCESSIVE

PREMIUM GROWTH.

25

UNDER LAWS ADOPTED BY

INDIVIDUAL STATES, INSURERS HAVING LESS TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL THAN THAT

REQUIRED BY THE RBC CALCULATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF

REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL INADEQUACY.  THE RBC RATIOS FOR EACH OF OUR INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES CURRENTLY ARE ABOVE THE RANGES THAT WOULD REQUIRE ANY REGULATORY

OR CORRECTIVE ACTION.

IRIS TESTS.

THE NAIC HAS DEVELOPED A SET OF FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OR TESTS KNOWN

AS THE INSURANCE REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM TO ASSIST STATE REGULATORS IN

MONITORING THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND IDENTIFYING

COMPANIES THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION OR ACTION BY INSURANCE REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES.  INSURANCE COMPANIES GENERALLY

SUBMIT DATA ANNUALLY TO THE NAIC, WHICH IN TURN ANALYZES THE DATA USING

PRESCRIBED FINANCIAL DATA RATIOS, EACH WITH DEFINED USUAL RANGES.  GENERALLY, REGULATORS WILL BEGIN TO

INVESTIGATE OR MONITOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY IF ITS RATIOS FALL OUTSIDE THE

USUAL RANGES FOR FOUR OR MORE OF THE RATIOS.

IF AN INSURANCE COMPANY HAS INSUFFICIENT CAPITAL, REGULATORS MAY ACT TO

REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE IT CAN ISSUE.

WE ARE NOT AWARE THAT ANY OF OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY

SUBJECT TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY BASED ON THESE RATIOS.

INSURANCE RESERVES

. STATE AND PROVINCIAL INSURANCE

LAWS REQUIRE US TO ANALYZE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVES ANNUALLY. OUR ACTUARIES

MUST SUBMIT AN OPINION THAT OUR RESERVES, WHEN CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE

ASSETS WE HOLD WITH RESPECT TO THOSE RESERVES, MAKE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR OUR

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED EXPENSES.

SHARED MARKET AND SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS.

STATE INSURANCE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS REQUIRE US TO PARTICIPATE IN MANDATORY PROPERTY-LIABILITY SHARED

MARKET, POOLING OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS THAT PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO

INDIVIDUALS OR OTHERS WHO OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE COVERAGE VOLUNTARILY

PROVIDED BY PRIVATE INSURERS.  SHARED

MARKET MECHANISMS INCLUDE ASSIGNED RISK PLANS; FAIR ACCESS TO INSURANCE

REQUIREMENT OR FAIR PLANS; AND REINSURANCE FACILITIES FOR COVERING

CATASTROPHIC RISK.  IN ADDITION, SOME

STATES REQUIRE INSURERS TO PARTICIPATE IN REINSURANCE POOLS FOR CLAIMS THAT

EXCEED SPECIFIED AMOUNTS.  OUR

PARTICIPATION IN THESE MANDATORY SHARED MARKET OR POOLING MECHANISMS GENERALLY

IS RELATED TO THE AMOUNTS OF OUR DIRECT WRITINGS FOR THE TYPE OF COVERAGE

WRITTEN BY THE SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENT IN THE APPLICABLE STATE.  WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF

OUR PARTICIPATION IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS.

INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION ASSESSMENTS.

EACH STATE HAS INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION LAWS UNDER WHICH LIFE AND

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE MAY BE ASSESSED BY

STATE INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS FOR CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF INSOLVENT

INSURANCE COMPANIES TO POLICYHOLDERS AND CLAIMANTS.  TYPICALLY, STATES ASSESS EACH MEMBER INSURER IN AN AMOUNT RELATED

TO THE MEMBER INSURERS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE BUSINESS WRITTEN BY ALL

MEMBER INSURERS IN THE STATE.  FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, WE INCURRED NET EXPENSE OF $13 MILLION

AND $5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, PURSUANT TO STATE INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION

LAWS.  WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE

AMOUNT AND TIMING OF ANY FUTURE ASSESSMENTS ON OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES UNDER

THESE LAWS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED RESERVES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE FOR

ASSESSMENTS RELATING TO INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO

INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS.

FEDERAL

REGULATION OF INSURANCE OPERATIONS.

ON

NOVEMBER 26, 2002, PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED INTO LAW THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE

ACT OF 2002, OR TRIA.  A DISCUSSION OF

TRIAS PRINCIPAL PROVISIONS CAN BE FOUND IN THE TERRORISM RISK AND

LEGISLATION SECTION OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS INCLUDED ON PAGES

25 AND 26 OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED

HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

OUR DOMESTIC INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO TRIA, ALTHOUGH TRIA DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL OF THE

COVERAGES THEY WRITE.  TRIA DOES APPLY

TO MOST OF OUR COVERAGES WRITTEN, INCLUDING PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL,

FIRE, OCEAN MARINE, INLAND MARINE, LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL AUTO, AIRCRAFT, SURETY

AND WORKERS COMPENSATION.

INTERNATIONAL

REGULATION OF INSURANCE OPERATIONS.

OUR INSURANCE UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM ARE REGULATED BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA).  THE FSAS PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES ARE TO

MAINTAIN MARKET CONFIDENCE, PROMOTE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINANCIAL

SYSTEM, PROTECT CONSUMERS, AND TO FIGHT FINANCIAL CRIME.  IN CANADA, THE CONDUCT OF INSURANCE BUSINESS

IS REGULATED UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT OF 1992, WHICH

REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVELS OF CAPITAL DEPENDING ON

THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSURANCE POLICIES IN FORCE.  THE LLOYDS OPERATION IS ALSO REGULATED BY THE FSA, WHICH HAS

DELEGATED CERTAIN REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE COUNCIL OF LLOYDS.  WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS IN THE

OTHER COUNTRIES AND JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE UNDERWRITE INSURANCE

BUSINESS.  THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

OUR PLANS TO CEASE UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS IN SELECTED FOREIGN COUNTRIES WERE

SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL IN SEVERAL OF THOSE COUNTRIES.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

ONE OF NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS SUBSIDIARIES IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER/DEALER UNDER THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE COMMISSION), NASD REGULATION, INC. AND OTHER FEDERAL

AND STATE AGENCIES AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS.  THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY REGULATED IN

THE UNITED STATES, AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN

RESULT IN THE REVOCATION OF BROKER/DEALER LICENSES, THE IMPOSITION OF CENSURES

OR FINES, AND THE SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A FIRM AND/OR ITS EMPLOYEES FROM

THE SECURITIES BUSINESS.

EACH OF NUVEEN

INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT ADVISER SUBSIDIARIES IS REGISTERED WITH THE COMMISSION

UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT.

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF NUVEEN INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

BUSINESS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE PRIMARILY

INTENDED TO BENEFIT THE INVESTMENT PRODUCT HOLDER AND GENERALLY GRANT SUPERVISORY

AGENCIES AND BODIES BROAD ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS, INCLUDING THE POWER TO LIMIT

OR RESTRICT NUVEEN FROM CARRYING ON ITS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS IN THE

EVENT THAT IT FAILS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  IN SUCH EVENT, THE POSSIBLE SANCTIONS THAT

MAY BE IMPOSED INCLUDE THE SUSPENSION OF INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, LIMITATIONS ON

NUVEEN INVESTMENTS ENGAGING IN THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS FOR

SPECIFIED PERIODS OF TIME, THE REVOCATION OF ITS ADVISORY SUBSIDIARIES

REGISTRATIONS AS INVESTMENT ADVISERS OR OTHER CENSURES AND FINES.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT DISCLOSURE AND CERTAIN RISKS

THIS

REPORT CONTAINS CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE

PRIVATE LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

FIRE AND MARINE OWNS OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS

BUILDINGS, LOCATED AT 385 WASHINGTON STREET AND 130 WEST SIXTH STREET, ST.

PAUL, MN.  THESE BUILDINGS ARE ADJACENT

TO ONE ANOTHER AND CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GROSS

FLOOR SPACE.  FIRE AND MARINE ALSO OWNS

PROPERTY IN WOODBURY, MN WHERE ITS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES BUILDING AND

OFF-SITE COMPUTER PROCESSING OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED.  FIRE AND MARINE ALSO OWNS THE FORMER USF&G HEADQUARTERS

CAMPUS KNOWN AS MOUNT WASHINGTON CENTER, LOCATED IN BALTIMORE, MD.  THE CAMPUS CURRENTLY HOUSES OFFICES FOR

CERTAIN EXECUTIVES OF THE ST. PAUL, AS WELL AS OFFICES FOR CERTAIN

UNDERWRITING, LEGAL AND CLAIM PERSONNEL.

A TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER ALSO RESIDES ON THE MOUNT WASHINGTON

CAMPUS.  FIRE AND MARINE HAS LEASED A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ONE OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE CAMPUS TO AN OUTSIDE

PARTY.  AT THE END OF JANUARY 2003, WE

SIGNED A NONBINDING LETTER OF INTENT TO SELL THE ENTIRE MOUNT WASHINGTON CENTER

CAMPUS.  IN THE EVENT THAT POTENTIAL

SALE OCCURS, WE EXPECT TO LEASE BACK A PORTION OF THE PROPERTY UNTIL SEPTEMBER

30, 2004.

WE OWN A BUILDING IN

LONDON, ENGLAND, WHICH HOUSES A PORTION OF OUR U.K. OPERATIONS.  WE RETAINED OWNERSHIP OF ANOTHER BUILDING IN

LONDON SUBSEQUENT TO THE SALE OF MINET HOLDINGS PLC TO AON CORPORATION IN 1997,

WHICH IS BEING LEASED TO AN OUTSIDE PARTY.

IN A TRANSACTION COMPLETED IN MARCH 2001, WE SOLD A 50% INTEREST IN THIS

BUILDING.

FIRE AND MARINE AND ITS

SUBSIDIARY, ST. PAUL PROPERTIES, INC., OWN A PORTFOLIO OF INCOME-PRODUCING

PROPERTIES IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT THEY HAVE

PURCHASED FOR INVESTMENT.  INCLUDED IN

THIS PORTFOLIO ARE FOUR OFFICE BUILDINGS IN WHICH WE HOLD A 50% OWNERSHIP

INTEREST LOCATED ON MANHATTAN ISLAND IN NEW YORK, NY WHICH COLLECTIVELY

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PROPERTY PORTFOLIO

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

OUR OPERATING

SUBSIDIARIES RENT OR LEASE OFFICE SPACE IN MOST CITIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE

CURRENTLY OWNED AND LEASED OFFICE FACILITIES OF THE ST. PAUL AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES ADEQUATE FOR THE CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE LEVEL OF

OPERATIONS.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE INFORMATION SET FORTH

IN THE LEGAL MATTERS SECTION OF NOTE 17 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AND THE ASBESTOS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND

ASBESTOS CLAIMS SECTIONS OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, WHICH ARE

ALL INCLUDED IN OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN

BY REFERENCE.

IN 1990, AT THE DIRECTION

OF THE UK DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (DTI), FIVE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING

SUBSIDIARIES OF LONDON UNITED INVESTMENTS PLC (LUI) SUSPENDED UNDERWRITING NEW

INSURANCE BUSINESS.  AT THE SAME TIME,

FOUR OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES, BEING INSOLVENT, SUSPENDED PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND

HAVE SINCE BEEN PLACED IN PROVISIONAL LIQUIDATION.  THE FIFTH SUBSIDIARY, WALBROOK INSURANCE COMPANY, CONTINUED

PAYING CLAIMS UNTIL MAY OF 1992 WHEN IT WAS ALSO PLACED IN PROVISIONAL

INSOLVENT LIQUIDATION.  WEAVERS

UNDERWRITING AGENCY (WEAVERS), AN LUI SUBSIDIARY, MANAGED THESE INSURERS.  MINET, A FORMER INSURANCE BROKERAGE

SUBSIDIARY OF OURS, HAD BROKERED BUSINESS TO AND FROM WEAVERS FOR MANY

YEARS.  FROM 1973 THROUGH 1980, OUR

UK-BASED UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS, NOW CALLED ST. PAUL INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE

COMPANY LTD. (SPI), HAD ACCEPTED BUSINESS FROM WEAVERS.  A PORTION OF THAT BUSINESS WAS CEDED BY SPI

TO REINSURERS.  CERTAIN OF THOSE

REINSURERS HAVE CHALLENGED THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN REINSURANCE CONTRACTS (OR

THE AMOUNT OF RECOVERY THEREUNDER) RELATING TO THE WEAVERS POOL, OF WHICH SPI

WAS A MEMBER, IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID LIABILITY UNDER THOSE CONTRACTS.  SPI AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE WEAVERS POOL

ARE SEEKING ENFORCEMENT OF THE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS.  MINET MAY ALSO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING

FROM ITS ROLE AS ONE OF THE MAJOR BROKERS FOR WEAVERS.  WHEN WE SOLD MINET IN MAY 1997, WE AGREED TO

INDEMNIFY THE PURCHASER FOR MOST OF MINETS THEN EXISTING LIABILITIES,

INCLUDING LIABILITIES RELATING TO THE WEAVERS MATTER. WE WILL VIGOROUSLY

CONTEST ANY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THE WEAVERS MATTER.  WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS, IF ADVERSE TO US, MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THAT OUTCOME OCCURS.

WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH AN ADVERSE OUTCOME, HOWEVER, WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY OR OVERALL FINANCIAL POSITION.
