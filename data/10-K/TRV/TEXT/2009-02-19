PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE AREAS OF PRICE, SERVICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AGENT

RELATIONSHIPS AND METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION, I.E., USE OF INDEPENDENT AGENTS, EXCLUSIVE AGENTS, DIRECT MARKETING (INCLUDING USE OF TOLL-FREE NUMBERS AND THE INTERNET) AND/OR SALARIED

EMPLOYEES. ACCORDING TO A.M. BEST, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 960 PROPERTY CASUALTY ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 2,300 PROPERTY AND CASUALTY COMPANIES. OF THOSE

ORGANIZATIONS, THE TOP 150 ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 92% OF THE CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRY'S TOTAL NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2007. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INSURERS. IN ADDITION,

SEVERAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS WRITING COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, OFFER PRODUCTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF RISK PROTECTION IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL INSURANCE

PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS AND VARIOUS FORMS OF SELF-INSURANCE THAT UTILIZE CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND RISK RETENTION GROUPS. THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE

POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.

COMPANIES. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS CLIENTS FOR THE MOST PART SELECT LOSS-SENSITIVE PRODUCTS IN CONNECTION WITH A LARGE DEDUCTIBLE OR SELF-INSURED PROGRAM AND, TO A MUCH LESSER

CERTAIN OF THESE PRODUCTS.

SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION

DISTRIBUTES ADMITTED AND EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY PRODUCTS PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH SELECTED

WHOLESALE AGENTS, BOTH ON A BROKERAGE AND MANAGING GENERAL UNDERWRITING BASIS, AND THROUGH SELECTED PROGRAM AGENTS. BROKERS, GENERAL AGENTS AND PROGRAM AGENTS OPERATE IN CERTAIN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT

TYPICALLY SERVED BY THE COMPANY'S APPOINTED RETAIL AGENTS, OR THEY MAINTAIN CERTAIN AFFINITY ARRANGEMENTS IN SPECIALIZED MARKET SEGMENTS. THE WHOLESALE EXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES MARKET, WHICH IS

CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF RATE AND FORM REGULATION, ALLOWS FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY TO WRITE CERTAIN CLASSES OF BUSINESS. IN WORKING WITH WHOLESALE OR PROGRAM AGENTS ON A BROKERAGE BASIS,

SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION UNDERWRITES THE BUSINESS AND SETS THE PREMIUM LEVEL. IN WORKING WITH WHOLESALE OR PROGRAM AGENTS ON A MANAGING GENERAL UNDERWRITING OR PROGRAM MANAGER BASIS, THE AGENTS

PRODUCE AND UNDERWRITE BUSINESS THAT CONFORMS TO UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR EACH FACILITY OR PROGRAM.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING OF BUSINESS INSURANCE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN ESTIMATION OF EXPECTED

LOSSES, THE EXPENSES OF PRODUCING, ISSUING AND SERVICING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LOSS AND EXPENSE CASH FLOWS, AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT.

THE COMPANY HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES PROFITABLE GROWTH RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE.

BUSINESS

INSURANCE HAS DEVELOPED AN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINES FOR PARTICULAR

INDUSTRIES. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DISCIPLINE. IT UTILIZES PROPRIETARY DATA GATHERED AND ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO ITS BUSINESS INSURANCE BUSINESS

OVER MANY YEARS. THE UNDERWRITERS AND ENGINEERS USE THIS INFORMATION TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE RISKS PRIOR TO QUOTATION. THIS INFORMATION PROVIDES SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

THIS

METHODOLOGY ENABLES BUSINESS INSURANCE TO STREAMLINE ITS RISK SELECTION PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING PARAMETERS THAT WILL NOT COMPROMISE ITS UNDERWRITING INTEGRITY.

FOR

SMALLER BUSINESSES, SELECT ACCOUNTS USES A PROCESS BASED ON INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATIONS TO ALLOW AGENTS AND FIELD UNDERWRITING REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DECISIONS

WITHIN PREDETERMINED CLASSIFICATIONS, BECAUSE UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND PRICING TEND TO BE MORE STANDARDIZED FOR THESE SMALLER EXPOSURES.

A

PORTION OF BUSINESS IN THIS SEGMENT, PARTICULARLY IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSTRUCTION, IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE

CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT

AND IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK UNTIL SUCH REIMBURSEMENT IS MADE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ON UNPAID LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES WERE

EACH APPROXIMATELY $6.34 BILLION. RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES ARE ALSO USED FOR WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGE. ALTHOUGH THE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED FEATURE OF THE POLICY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES

INSURANCE RISK FOR THE COMPANY, IT INTRODUCES ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY. PREMIUM RECEIVABLES FROM HOLDERS OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $322 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008. SIGNIFICANT COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CASH COLLATERAL, TRUSTS OR SURETY BONDS, IS GENERALLY REQUESTED FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PLANS AND/OR

RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES THAT PROVIDE FOR DEFERRED COLLECTION OF DEDUCTIBLE RECOVERIES AND/OR ULTIMATE PREMIUMS. THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL REQUESTED IS PREDICATED UPON

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMER AND THE NATURE OF THE INSURED RISKS. BUSINESS INSURANCE CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE CREDIT EXPOSURE ON INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS AND THE ADEQUACY OF COLLATERAL.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO NATURAL AND MAN-MADE PERIL CATASTROPHIC LOSSES AND ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURE. IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE COMPANY'S

EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, BUSINESS INSURANCE LIMITS THE WRITING OF NEW PROPERTY BUSINESS AND SELECTIVELY TAKES UNDERWRITING ACTION ON EXISTING BUSINESS IN SOME MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

HAS TIGHTENED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, IMPLEMENTED PRICE INCREASES IN SOME CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS AND PUT IN PLACE DEDUCTIBLES SPECIFIC TO HURRICANE-, WIND- AND HAIL-PRONE

AREAS. THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE UNDERWRITING RISKS OF BUSINESS IN HURRICANE-PRONE, EARTHQUAKE-PRONE AND TARGET

COMPETITION

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS REPRESENTED IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE BY MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZE AS WELL AS OTHER

ENTITIES OFFERING RISK ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS OR CAPTIVE PROGRAMS. MARKET COMPETITION WORKS WITHIN THE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO SET THE PRICE CHARGED FOR

INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND THE LEVEL OF SERVICE PROVIDED. A COMPANY'S SUCCESS IN THE COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE LANDSCAPE IS LARGELY MEASURED BY ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE INSURANCE AND SERVICES AT A

PRICE AND ON TERMS THAT ARE REASONABLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE CUSTOMER, AS WELL AS ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS.

SELECT

ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY WRITTEN THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS AND DIRECT WRITERS. BOTH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROPERTY CASUALTY

INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE IN THE SELECT ACCOUNTS MARKET WHICH GENERALLY COMPRISES LOWER HAZARD, "MAIN STREET" BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. RISKS ARE UNDERWRITTEN AND PRICED USING STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICES

AND A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRODUCT OFFERINGS. COMPETITION IN THIS MARKET IS PRIMARILY BASED ON PRODUCT OFFERINGS, SERVICE LEVELS, EASE OF DOING BUSINESS AND PRICE. SELECT

ACCOUNTS HAS ESTABLISHED A STRONG MARKETING RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND HAS PROVIDED IT WITH DEFINED UNDERWRITING POLICIES, A BROAD ARRAY OF PRODUCTS, COMPETITIVE PRICES AND AN

EFFICIENT AUTOMATED

ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED CENTRALIZED SERVICE CENTERS TO HELP AGENTS PERFORM MANY SERVICE FUNCTIONS, IN RETURN FOR A FEE.

COMMERCIAL

ACCOUNTS BUSINESS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN PRINCIPALLY WRITTEN THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ARE PRIMARILY NATIONAL PROPERTY CASUALTY

INSURANCE COMPANIES WILLING TO WRITE MOST CLASSES OF BUSINESS USING TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND PRICING, AND REGIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES. COMPANIES COMPETE BASED ON PRODUCT OFFERINGS, SERVICE LEVELS,

PRICE AND CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES. EFFICIENCY THROUGH AUTOMATION AND RAPID RESPONSE TIME TO CUSTOMER NEEDS IS KEY TO SUCCESS IN THIS MARKET.

THE

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS GROUP IS COMPRISED OF THREE BUSINESS UNITS.



NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY WRITTEN THROUGH NATIONAL BROKERS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REGIONAL BROKERS.

INSURANCE COMPANIES COMPETE IN THIS MARKET BASED ON PRICE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES, MANAGED CARE COST CONTAINMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. NATIONAL

ACCOUNTS ALSO OFFERS A LARGE NETWORK OF LOCALIZED CLAIM SERVICE CENTERS WHICH ALLOWS NATIONAL ACCOUNTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO MORE QUICKLY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS.



DISCOVER RE COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL PROVIDERS OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COVERAGES, AS WELL AS OTHER UNDERWRITERS OF

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE IN THE ALTERNATIVE RISK TRANSFER MARKET, SUCH AS RISK RETENTION GROUPS, SELF-INSURANCE PLANS, CAPTIVES MANAGED BY OTHERS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER

RISK-FINANCING VEHICLES AND MECHANISMS.



NATIONAL ACCOUNTS' RESIDUAL MARKET BUSINESS COMPETES FOR STATE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

THESE CONTRACTS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE THREE-YEAR TERMS, ARE SELECTED BY STATE AGENCIES THROUGH A BID PROCESS BASED ON THE QUALITY OF SERVICE AND PRICE. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS SERVICES

APPROXIMATELY 33% OF THE TOTAL WORKERS' COMPENSATION ASSIGNED RISK MARKET, MAKING THE COMPANY ONE OF THE LARGEST SERVICING CARRIERS IN THE INDUSTRY.

THERE

ARE SEVERAL OTHER BUSINESS GROUPS IN BUSINESS INSURANCE THAT COMPETE IN FOCUSED TARGET MARKETS. EACH OF THESE MARKETS IS DIFFERENT AND REQUIRES UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF INDUSTRY

KNOWLEDGE, CUSTOMIZED COVERAGE, SPECIALIZED RISK CONTROL AND LOSS HANDLING SERVICES, AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH AGENTS AND BROKERS THAT ALSO FOCUS ON THESE MARKETS. SOME OF THESE BUSINESS GROUPS COMPETE

WITH NATIONAL CARRIERS WITH SIMILARLY DEDICATED UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING GROUPS, WHEREAS OTHERS COMPETE WITH SMALLER REGIONAL COMPANIES. IN EITHER CASE, THESE BUSINESSES HAVE REGIONAL STRUCTURES

THAT ALLOW THEM TO DELIVER PERSONALIZED SERVICE AND LOCAL KNOWLEDGE TO THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. SPECIALIZED AGENTS AND

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BROKERS,

INCLUDING MANAGING GENERAL AGENTS AND WHOLESALE AGENTS, SUPPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY. IN ALL OF THESE BUSINESSES, THE COMPETITIVE STRATEGY IS MARKET LEADERSHIP ATTAINED THROUGH FOCUSED INDUSTRY

KNOWLEDGE APPLIED TO INSURANCE AND RISK NEEDS.

WITHIN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTES THE MAJORITY

OF ITS PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 6,900 OF THE SAME INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND BROKERS THAT DISTRIBUTE THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT'S PRODUCTS. THESE BROKERS AND INDEPENDENT

BROKERS. BY VIRTUE OF LLOYD'S WORLDWIDE LICENSES, FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE HAS ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS ACROSS THE WORLD.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING OF FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY DEVELOPED

BASED UPON AN ESTIMATION OF EXPECTED LOSSES, THE EXPENSES OF PRODUCING, ISSUING AND SERVICING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LOSS AND EXPENSE CASH FLOWS,

AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT. THE COMPANY HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES PROFITABLE GROWTH RATHER THAN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE.

FINANCIAL,

PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE HAS DEVELOPED AN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES DEDICATED UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS, ENGINEERING, ACTUARIAL

AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DISCIPLINES. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING AND PRICING DISCIPLINE, BASED ON AN IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIFIC ACCOUNT OR

INDUSTRY ISSUES. THE UNDERWRITERS USE INDUSTRY AND PROPRIETARY DATA GATHERED AND ANALYZED OVER MANY YEARS TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE RISKS PRIOR TO QUOTATION, AND THEN USE PROPRIETARY FORMS (FOR DOMESTIC

NON-LLOYD'S MARKETS) TO TAILOR INSURANCE COVERAGE TO INSUREDS WITHIN THE TARGET MARKETS. THIS METHODOLOGY ENABLES FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE TO STREAMLINE ITS

RISK SELECTION PROCESS AND DEVELOP PRICING PARAMETERS THAT WILL PRESERVE ITS UNDERWRITING INTEGRITY.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO NATURAL AND MAN-MADE PERIL CATASTROPHIC LOSSES AND ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND

METHODS, INCLUDING SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE UNDERWRITING RISKS OF BUSINESS IN HURRICANE-PRONE, EARTHQUAKE-PRONE AND TARGET RISK AREAS FOR TERRORISM. THE COMPANY RELIES,

IN PART, UPON THIS ANALYSIS TO MAKE UNDERWRITING DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE ON CATASTROPHE-EXPOSED BUSINESS. SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OTHERS ARISING FROM ACTS OR FAILURES TO ACT UNDER SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS UMBRELLA AND EXCESS INSURANCE. ERRORS AND OMISSIONS INSURANCE FOR PROFESSIONALS (SUCH AS LAWYERS, ACCOUNTANTS,

ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS) IS SOMETIMES ALSO KNOWN AS PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE.

HIJACK, ILLEGAL DETENTION AND EXTORTION. WHILE THE COVERED HAZARDS MAY BE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE U.S. MARKET, THE DIFFERENT LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS CAN MAKE THE PRODUCT RISKS AND COVERAGE TERMS

POTENTIALLY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.

THEM THROUGH BOTH NATIONAL AND WHOLESALE BROKERS, REGIONAL BROKERS AND RETAIL AGENTS. ITS REPUTATION FOR TIMELY AND CONSISTENT DECISION MAKING, A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF LOCAL UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS AND

MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS AND ENABLES IT TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN A COMPLEX, DYNAMIC MARKETPLACE. THE ABILITY OF BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS TO

CROSS-SELL ITS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS OF THE BUSINESS INSURANCE AND PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENTS PROVIDES ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES FOR THE COMPANY.

PRINCIPAL MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION

PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 10,100 INDEPENDENT AGENTS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

STATES, SUPPORTED BY PERSONNEL IN 13 MARKETING REGIONS, THREE SINGLE STATE COMPANIES AND FIVE SERVICE CENTERS. IN SELECTING NEW INDEPENDENT AGENCIES TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, PERSONAL INSURANCE

CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER ATTRIBUTES, EACH AGENCY'S PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL STABILITY, STAFF EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGIC FIT WITH PERSONAL INSURANCE'S OPERATING AND MARKETING PLANS. ONCE AN AGENCY IS

APPOINTED, PERSONAL INSURANCE CAREFULLY MONITORS ITS PERFORMANCE. WHILE THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE'S INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE IN STATES ALONG THE EAST COAST, IN THE SOUTH AND TEXAS,

PERSONAL INSURANCE CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE OPERATES SINGLE-STATE OPERATIONS IN EACH OF MASSACHUSETTS, NEW JERSEY AND FLORIDA WITH PRODUCTS MARKETED PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS. THESE STATES REPRESENTED

APPROXIMATELY 16% OF PERSONAL INSURANCE DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2008. THESE OPERATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED TO MANAGE COMPLEX MARKETS IN MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW JERSEY AND PROPERTY CATASTROPHE

EXPOSURE

IN FLORIDA. MASSACHUSETTS HAS DEDICATED RESOURCES IN UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, FINANCE, LEGAL AND SERVICE FUNCTIONS. WHILE NEW JERSEY AND FLORIDA HAVE ALSO HAD DEDICATED RESOURCES, THEY ARE NOW

MOVING TOWARD SHARING RESOURCES IN A SIMILAR MANNER AS OTHER MARKETING REGIONS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN ITS SINGLE STATE COMPANIES IN EACH OF THESE STATES.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE USES A CONSISTENT OPERATING MODEL WITH AGENTS OUTSIDE OF THE SINGLE STATE COMPANIES DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE MODEL PROVIDES TECHNOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES TO AGENTS TO

MAXIMIZE THEIR EASE OF

DOING BUSINESS. PERSONAL INSURANCE AGENTS QUOTE AND ISSUE APPROXIMATELY 97% OF PERSONAL INSURANCE'S NEW BUSINESS POLICIES DIRECTLY FROM THEIR AGENCIES BY LEVERAGING EITHER THEIR OWN AGENCY MANAGEMENT

SYSTEM OR USING PERSONAL INSURANCE'S PROPRIETARY QUOTE AND ISSUANCE SYSTEMS WHICH ALLOW AGENTS TO RATE, QUOTE AND ISSUE POLICIES ON LINE. ALL OF THESE QUOTE AND ISSUE PLATFORMS INTERFACE WITH PERSONAL

INSURANCE'S UNDERWRITING AND RATING SYSTEMS, WHICH EDIT TRANSACTIONS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH PERSONAL INSURANCE'S UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PROGRAMS. BUSINESS PROCESSED BY AGENTS ON THESE PLATFORMS IS

SUBJECT TO CONSULTATIVE REVIEW BY PERSONAL INSURANCE'S IN-HOUSE UNDERWRITERS. PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO PROVIDES A DOWNLOAD CAPABILITY THAT REFRESHES THE INDIVIDUAL AGENCY SYSTEM DATABASES

OF APPROXIMATELY 8,100 AGENTS EACH DAY WITH UPDATED POLICY INFORMATION.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE CONTINUES TO DEVELOP FUNCTIONALITY TO PROVIDE ITS AGENTS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF ONLINE SERVICE CAPABILITIES PACKAGED TOGETHER IN AN

EASY-TO-USE AGENCY SERVICE PORTAL, INCLUDING CUSTOMER SERVICE, MARKETING AND CLAIM FUNCTIONALITY. AGENCIES CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO SHIFT THE ONGOING SERVICE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

PERSONAL INSURANCE'S CUSTOMERS TO ONE OF THE COMPANY'S FOUR CUSTOMER CARE CENTERS, WHERE THE COMPANY PROVIDES, ON BEHALF OF AN AGENCY, A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF DIRECT CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS, INCLUDING

RESPONSE TO BILLING AND COVERAGE INQUIRIES, AND POLICY CHANGES. APPROXIMATELY 1,440 AGENTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SERVICE ALTERNATIVE.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE ALSO MARKETS THROUGH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INCLUDING SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS EMPLOYERS AND CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS, AND DIRECT MARKETING. PERSONAL

INSURANCE HANDLES THE SALES AND SERVICE FOR THESE PROGRAMS EITHER THROUGH A SPONSORING INDEPENDENT AGENT OR THROUGH TWO OF THE COMPANY'S CALL CENTER LOCATIONS. A NUMBER OF WELL-KNOWN

CORPORATIONS MAKE THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS AVAILABLE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES PRIMARILY THROUGH A PAYROLL DEDUCTION PAYMENT PROCESS. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE

AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION (AAA) CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER AFFINITY GROUPS THAT MAKE AVAILABLE PERSONAL INSURANCE'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO THEIR MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, SINCE 1995, THE

COMPANY HAS HAD A MARKETING AGREEMENT WITH GEICO TO UNDERWRITE HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS FOR THEIR AUTO CUSTOMERS. THIS AGREEMENT HAS ADDED PROFITABLE BUSINESS AND HELPED TO GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSIFY THE

HOMEOWNERS LINE OF BUSINESS.

PRICING AND UNDERWRITING

PRICING OF PERSONAL INSURANCE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY DEVELOPED BASED UPON AN ESTIMATION OF EXPECTED

LOSSES, THE EXPENSES OF PRODUCING, ISSUING AND SERVICING BUSINESS AND MANAGING CLAIMS, THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LOSS AND EXPENSE CASH FLOWS, AND A REASONABLE ALLOWANCE FOR PROFIT.

THE COMPANY HAS A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO UNDERWRITING AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES PROFITABLE GROWTH RATHER THAN GROWTH IN PREMIUM VOLUME OR MARKET SHARE ALONE.

PERSONAL

INSURANCE HAS DEVELOPED A PRODUCT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT INTEGRATES THE DISCIPLINES OF UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, ACTUARIAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THIS APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO

MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY UNDERWRITING DISCIPLINE AND PRICING SEGMENTATION. PROPRIETARY DATA ACCUMULATED OVER MANY YEARS

IS ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO PERSONAL INSURANCE'S BUSINESS. PERSONAL INSURANCE USES A VARIETY OF PROPRIETARY AND VENDOR PRODUCED RISK DIFFERENTIATION MODELS TO FACILITATE ITS PRICING SEGMENTATION.

PERSONAL INSURANCE'S PRODUCT MANAGERS ESTABLISH UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES INTEGRATED WITH ITS FILED PRICING AND RATING PLANS, WHICH ENABLE PERSONAL INSURANCE TO EXECUTE ITS RISK SELECTION AND PRICING

PROCESSES.

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRICING

FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE IS DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF AUTOMOBILE REPAIRS, MEDICAL CARE AND LITIGATION OF

LIABILITY CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON PROMPTLY IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO DISPARITIES BETWEEN PREMIUM LEVELS AND PROJECTED CLAIM COSTS, AND

OBTAINING APPROVAL FROM STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WHEN NECESSARY FOR FILED RATE CHANGES.

PRICING

IN THE HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS IS ALSO DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY CHANGES IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS AND BY INFLATION IN THE COST OF BUILDING SUPPLIES, LABOR AND HOUSEHOLD POSSESSIONS.

MOST HOMEOWNERS POLICIES OFFER, BUT DO NOT REQUIRE, AUTOMATIC INCREASES IN COVERAGE TO REFLECT GROWTH IN REPLACEMENT COSTS. IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY MULTIPLE PERIL COVERAGE,

THE PROFITABILITY AND PRICING OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IS AFFECTED BY THE INCIDENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO WEATHER AND EARTHQUAKES. IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE COMPANY'S

EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, PERSONAL INSURANCE LIMITS THE WRITING OF NEW HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS AND SELECTIVELY TAKES UNDERWRITING ACTION ON EXISTING BUSINESS IN SOME MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY HAS TIGHTENED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, IMPLEMENTED PRICE INCREASES IN SOME CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS AND PUT IN PLACE DEDUCTIBLES SPECIFIC TO HURRICANE AND WIND- AND

HAIL-PRONE AREAS. PERSONAL INSURANCE USES SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER-MODELING TECHNIQUES TO ASSESS ITS LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS. SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING." THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES REINSURANCE TO MANAGE ITS

AGGREGATE EXPOSURES TO CATASTROPHES. SEE "REINSURANCE." CHANGES TO METHODS OF MARKETING AND UNDERWRITING IN SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO STATE-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, WHICH CAN MAKE IT

MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN INSURER TO SIGNIFICANTLY MANAGE CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES.

INSURERS

WRITING PERSONAL LINES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES MAY BE UNABLE TO INCREASE PRICES UNTIL SOME TIME AFTER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COVERAGE HAVE INCREASED, PRIMARILY BECAUSE

OF STATE INSURANCE RATE REGULATION. THE PACE AT WHICH AN INSURER CAN CHANGE RATES IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED COSTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON WHETHER THE APPLICABLE STATE LAW REQUIRES PRIOR APPROVAL OF RATE

INCREASES OR NOTIFICATION TO THE REGULATOR EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER A RATE CHANGE IS IMPOSED. IN STATES WITH PRIOR APPROVAL LAWS, RATES MUST BE APPROVED BY THE REGULATOR BEFORE BEING USED BY THE

INSURER. IN STATES HAVING "FILE-AND-USE" LAWS, THE INSURER MUST FILE RATE CHANGES WITH THE REGULATOR, BUT DOES NOT NEED TO WAIT FOR APPROVAL BEFORE USING THE NEW RATES. A

"USE-AND-FILE" LAW REQUIRES AN INSURER TO FILE RATES WITHIN A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE INSURER BEGINS USING THE NEW RATE. APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE STATES

REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL OF MOST RATE CHANGES. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO RAISE PRICES, MODIFY UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCE EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO

CONSIDERATIONS OF

PUBLIC POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND/OR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING

ACCESS TO OTHER UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES.

INDEPENDENT

AGENTS EITHER UTILIZE ONE OF THE COMPANY'S AUTOMATED QUOTE AND ISSUE SYSTEMS OR THEY SUBMIT APPLICATIONS TO THE COMPANY'S SERVICE CENTERS FOR UNDERWRITING REVIEW, QUOTE, AND

ISSUANCE. AUTOMATED TRANSACTIONS ARE EDITED BY THE COMPANY'S SYSTEMS AND ISSUED IF THEY CONFORM TO ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. EXCEPTIONS ARE REVIEWED BY UNDERWRITERS IN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS CENTERS.

AUDITS ARE CONDUCTED BY AN INTERNAL PEER REVIEW TEAM ACROSS ALL OF THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AGENCY GENERATED BUSINESS ON A SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING BASIS. EACH AGENT IS ASSIGNED TO A SPECIFIC EMPLOYEE OR

TEAM OF EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THE AGENT ON BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND OVERALL GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY USES AGENCY LEVEL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION TO ANALYZE

AND UNDERSTAND RESULTS AND TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES.

THE

PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH ADDITIONAL MARKETING CHANNELS UTILIZE THE SAME ISSUANCE SYSTEMS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY AND EXCEPTIONS ARE UNDERWRITTEN BY THE COMPANY'S

EMPLOYEES. UNDERWRITERS WORK WITH COMPANY MANAGEMENT ON BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND OVERALL GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. CHANNEL-SPECIFIC PRODUCTION AND CLAIM INFORMATION IS USED TO ANALYZE

RESULTS AND IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES.

PRODUCT LINES

THE PRIMARY COVERAGES IN PERSONAL INSURANCE ARE PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS. PERSONAL INSURANCE

HAD APPROXIMATELY 7.4 MILLION POLICIES IN FORCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY TO OTHERS FOR BOTH BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE AND FOR PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO AN

INSURED'S OWN VEHICLE FROM COLLISION AND VARIOUS OTHER PERILS. IN ADDITION, MANY STATES REQUIRE POLICIES TO PROVIDE FIRST-PARTY PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION, FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AS

NO-FAULT COVERAGE.

HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER

PROVIDES PROTECTION AGAINST LOSSES TO DWELLINGS AND CONTENTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF PERILS (EXCLUDING FLOODING), AS

WELL AS COVERAGE FOR PERSONAL LIABILITY. THE COMPANY WRITES

HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE FOR DWELLINGS, CONDOMINIUMS AND RENTAL PROPERTY CONTENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO WRITES COVERAGE FOR PERSONAL WATERCRAFT, PERSONAL ARTICLES SUCH AS JEWELRY, AND UMBRELLA LIABILITY

PROTECTION.

NET RETENTION POLICY

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S RETENTION POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT AS OF JANUARY 1,

2009. PERSONAL INSURANCE RETAINS THE FIRST $5.0 MILLION OF UMBRELLA POLICIES AND PURCHASES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE FOR LIMITS OVER $5.0 MILLION. FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY INSURANCE, THERE IS

A $7.0 MILLION MAXIMUM RETENTION PER RISK. THE COMPANY UTILIZES FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIMITS CAPACITY OR TO REDUCE RETENTIONS ON AN INDIVIDUAL RISK BASIS. THE COMPANY

MAY ALSO RETAIN AMOUNTS GREATER THAN THOSE DESCRIBED HEREIN BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RISK.

COMPETITION

PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE IS WRITTEN BY HUNDREDS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZES. ALTHOUGH NATIONAL COMPANIES WRITE THE MAJORITY

OF THE BUSINESS, PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM LOCAL AND REGIONAL COMPANIES. PERSONAL INSURANCE PRIMARILY COMPETES BASED ON SERVICE, EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, PRICE, PERCEIVED STABILITY

OF THE INSURER AND NAME RECOGNITION. PERSONAL INSURANCE COMPETES FOR BUSINESS WITHIN EACH INDEPENDENT AGENCY SINCE THESE AGENCIES ALSO OFFER POLICIES OF COMPETING COMPANIES. AT THE AGENCY LEVEL,

COMPETITION IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE LEVEL OF SERVICE, INCLUDING CLAIMS HANDLING, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF AUTOMATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIVIDUAL AGENTS,

AS WELL AS ON PRICE. PERSONAL INSURANCE ALSO COMPETES WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT USE EXCLUSIVE AGENTS OR SALARIED EMPLOYEES TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THOSE THAT EMPLOY DIRECT MARKETING

STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THE USE OF TOLL-FREE NUMBERS AND THE INTERNET. IN ADDITION TO ITS TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENT AGENCY DISTRIBUTION, PERSONAL INSURANCE HAS BROADENED ITS DISTRIBUTION OF

PRODUCTS BY MARKETING TO SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE AND AFFINITY GROUPS, THROUGH JOINT MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER INSURERS AND DIRECT MARKETING. PERSONAL INSURANCE BELIEVES

THAT ITS CONTINUED FOCUS ON UNDERWRITING AND PRICING SEGMENTATION, CLAIM SETTLEMENT EFFECTIVENESS STRATEGIES AND EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ENABLE PERSONAL INSURANCE TO PRICE ITS PRODUCTS

COMPETITIVELY IN ALL OF ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS FUNCTION IS MANAGED THROUGH ITS CLAIM SERVICES OPERATIONS. WITH NEARLY 13,000 EMPLOYEES, CLAIM SERVICES EMPLOYS A

DIVERSE GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS, INCLUDING CLAIM ADJUSTERS, APPRAISERS, ATTORNEYS, INVESTIGATORS, ENGINEERS, ACCOUNTANTS, SYSTEM SPECIALISTS AND TRAINING, MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL. APPROVED

EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS INDEPENDENT ADJUSTERS AND APPRAISERS, INVESTIGATORS AND ATTORNEYS, ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE AS APPROPRIATE.

FIELD

CLAIM MANAGEMENT TEAMS LOCATED IN 27 CLAIM CENTERS AND 87 SATELLITE AND SPECIALTY-ONLY OFFICES IN 46 STATES ARE ORGANIZED TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC CLAIM

CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE TO THE BUSINESSES WITHIN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE, FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE, AND PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENTS. CLAIM TEAMS WITH SPECIALIZED SKILLS,

RESOURCES, AND WORKFLOWS ARE MATCHED TO THE UNIQUE EXPOSURES OF THOSE BUSINESSES WITH LOCAL CLAIMS MANAGEMENT DEDICATED TO ACHIEVING OPTIMAL RESULTS WITHIN EACH SEGMENT. THE COMPANY'S HOME OFFICE

OPERATIONS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF WORKFLOW DESIGN, QUALITY MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCED MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS, TRAINING, FINANCIAL REPORTING AND

CONTROL, AND HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY. THIS STRUCTURE PERMITS THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF A LARGER, ESTABLISHED COMPANY WHILE RETAINING THE AGILITY TO RESPOND PROMPTLY TO THE

NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS, BROKERS, AGENTS AND UNDERWRITERS. CLAIMS MANAGEMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL IS GENERALLY PROVIDED LOCALLY BY STAFF IN THE RESPECTIVE INTERNATIONAL LOCATION DUE TO LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF

APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

AN

INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY TO BENEFIT CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS IS ITS CONTINUING INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INSURANCE FRAUD THROUGH ITS INVESTIGATIVE

SERVICES UNIT. THE COMPANY HAS A NATIONWIDE STAFF OF EXPERTS THAT INVESTIGATE A WIDE ARRAY OF INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEMES USING IN-HOUSE FORENSIC RESOURCES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS. THIS

STAFF ALSO HAS SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE IN FIRE SCENE EXAMINATIONS, MEDICAL PROVIDER FRAUD SCHEMES AND DATA MINING. THE COMPANY ALSO DEDICATES INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT VIOLATIONS OF LAW ARE

REPORTED TO AND PROSECUTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

CLAIM

SERVICES USES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, AND DATA ANALYSIS TO ASSIST THE COMPANY IN REVIEWING ITS CLAIM PRACTICES AND RESULTS TO EVALUATE AND IMPROVE ITS CLAIMS

MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON SEGMENTATION OF CLAIMS AND APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL SPECIALIZATION TO DRIVE EFFECTIVE CLAIM RESOLUTION. THE COMPANY

CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS INVESTMENT IN CLAIM RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE FOCUS ON CLAIM OUTCOMES AND A

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISCIPLINED

APPROACH TO CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT. IN 2007, THE COMPANY OPENED A STATE-OF-THE-ART CLAIMS TRAINING FACILITY, OFFERING HANDS-ON EXPERIENTIAL

LEARNING TO HELP ENSURE THAT ITS CLAIM PROFESSIONALS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED. IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN MANY OF ITS CLAIM

HANDLING OPERATIONS AND ROUTINELY MONITORS THE EFFECT OF ITS INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE A CONSISTENT OPTIMIZATION AMONG OUTCOMES, COST AND SERVICE.

DURING

2006, CLAIM SERVICES REFINED ITS CATASTROPHE RESPONSE STRATEGY TO INCREASE THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RESPOND TO A SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHIC EVENT USING ITS OWN PERSONNEL, ENABLING

IT TO MINIMIZE RELIANCE ON INDEPENDENT ADJUSTORS AND APPRAISERS. DURING 2007, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO DEVELOP A LARGER DEDICATED CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM AND TRAINED A LARGER ENTERPRISE RESPONSE

TEAM OF EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHO CAN BE DEPLOYED ON SHORT NOTICE IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHE THAT GENERATES CLAIM VOLUME EXCEEDING THE CAPACITY OF THE DEDICATED CATASTROPHE RESPONSE TEAM. IN 2008,

THESE INTERNAL RESOURCES WERE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED TO RESPOND TO A RECORD NUMBER OF CATASTROPHE CLAIMS, INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM HURRICANES IKE, GUSTAV AND DOLLY.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE CLAIM SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE COMPANY'S AUTO CLAIM SERVICE THAT FEATURES TWO COMPANY-OWNED

AUTO REPAIR FACILITIES AND SELECTED INDEPENDENTLY-OWNED AUTO REPAIR FACILITIES WITH COMPANY APPRAISERS ON SITE TO COMPLETE AN ESTIMATE, HANDLE ALL RENTAL ARRANGEMENTS AND MONITOR THE REPAIR PROCESS

FROM START TO FINISH. BY MANAGING THE CLAIMS IN THIS WAY, THE COMPANY CAN HELP ENSURE PROMPT, QUALITY RESULTS AND CREATE A DIFFERENTIATED, SUPERIOR CLAIM EXPERIENCE FOR CUSTOMERS.

ANOTHER

STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IS TRAVCOMP

SM

, A WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIM RESOLUTION AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT ASSISTS ADJUSTERS IN THE PROMPT INVESTIGATION AND

EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS. INNOVATIVE MEDICAL AND CLAIMS MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES PERMIT NURSE, MEDICAL AND CLAIMS PROFESSIONALS TO SHARE APPROPRIATE VITAL INFORMATION THAT

SUPPORTS PROMPT INVESTIGATION, EFFECTIVE RETURN TO WORK AND CLAIM RESOLUTION STRATEGIES. THESE TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH EFFECTIVE MATCHING OF PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND AUTHORITY TO SPECIFIC CLAIM

ISSUES, HAVE RESULTED IN MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS WITH LOWER MEDICAL, WAGE REPLACEMENT COSTS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY REINSURES A PORTION OF THE RISKS IT UNDERWRITES IN ORDER TO CONTROL ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES. THE COMPANY CEDES TO REINSURERS

A PORTION OF THESE RISKS AND PAYS PREMIUMS BASED UPON THE RISK AND EXPOSURE OF THE POLICIES SUBJECT TO SUCH REINSURANCE. CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES CREDIT RISK, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO MANDATORY POOLS,

AND IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS. ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF THE REINSURANCE CEDED, THE COMPANY REMAINS LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS

REINSURED. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED AFTER REDUCTIONS FOR KNOWN INSOLVENCIES AND AFTER ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS COLLATERAL, INCLUDING TRUST AGREEMENTS,

ESCROW FUNDS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, UNDER CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF REINSURERS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND REVIEWS ITS REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS

PERIODICALLY. REINSURERS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES, THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL PROVIDED. AFTER REINSURANCE IS PURCHASED,

THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED ABILITY TO

MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK TO A REINSURER. IN ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT

TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION CONCERNING REINSURANCE, SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS."

FOR

A DESCRIPTION OF REINSURANCE-RELATED LITIGATION, SEE "ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS."

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

CATASTROPHES CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL AND MAN-MADE EVENTS INCLUDING HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL,

SEVERE WINTER

WEATHER, EXPLOSIONS AND FIRES. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED

EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS; HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE

IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF CATASTROPHE

REINSURANCE. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY WITH UNAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES. IN ADDITION TO THE COVERAGE

PROVIDED UNDER THIS TREATY, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES A CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAM, AS WELL AS A NORTHEAST CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY, TO PROTECT AGAINST LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES IN THE

NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.

GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY.

THE GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY COVERS THE ACCUMULATION OF NET PROPERTY LOSSES

ARISING OUT OF ONE

OCCURRENCE. THE TREATY ONLY PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR TERRORISM EVENTS IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXCLUDES ENTIRELY LOSSES ARISING FROM NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL ATTACKS. THE TREATY

COVERS ALL OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA AND THEIR POSSESSIONS AND WATERS CONTIGUOUS THERETO, THE CARIBBEAN AND MEXICO. FOR BUSINESS UNDERWRITTEN IN CANADA, THE UNITED

KINGDOM, REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S, SEPARATE REINSURANCE PROTECTIONS ARE PURCHASED LOCALLY THAT HAVE LOWER NET RETENTIONS MORE COMMENSURATE WITH THE SIZE OF THE

RESPECTIVE LOCAL BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS AN ONGOING REVIEW OF ITS RISK AND CATASTROPHE COVERAGES AND MAKES CHANGES AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAM.

IN MAY 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A MULTI-YEAR CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAM TO PROVIDE

REINSURANCE PROTECTION FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM HURRICANES AND CERTAIN OTHER CATASTROPHES IN THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES (FROM NEW JERSEY TO MAINE). THE COMPANY MAY OBTAIN REINSURANCE UNDER THE

PROGRAM BY ENTERING INTO ONE OR MORE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WITH LONGPOINT RE LTD. (LONGPOINT RE), A NEWLY-FORMED INDEPENDENT CAYMAN ISLANDS INSURANCE COMPANY. LONGPOINT RE SUCCESSFULLY

COMPLETED AN OFFERING TO UNRELATED INVESTORS UNDER THE PROGRAM OF $500 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF CATASTROPHE BONDS ON MAY 8, 2007. IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING, THE

COMPANY AND LONGPOINT RE ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR REINSURANCE AGREEMENT PROVIDING UP TO $500 MILLION OF REINSURANCE FROM LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTAIN HURRICANE EVENTS IN THE

NORTHEAST UNITED STATES. THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY AND LONGPOINT RE UTILIZES A DUAL TRIGGER THAT IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S COVERED LOSSES INCURRED AND AN INDEX THAT IS

CREATED BY APPLYING PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGES TO INSURED INDUSTRY LOSSES IN EACH STATE IN THE COVERED AREA AS REPORTED BY PROPERTY CLAIM SERVICES, A DIVISION OF INSURANCE SERVICES OFFICES, INC.

AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE INDEX-BASED LOSSES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO APPROXIMATE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL LOSSES FROM ANY COVERED EVENT. THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE CATASTROPHE BONDS WILL BE REDUCED BY ANY AMOUNTS PAID TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT. THE INDEX-BASED LOSSES ATTACHMENT POINT AND MAXIMUM LIMIT ARE RESET

ANNUALLY TO MAINTAIN A PROBABILITY OF LOSS ON THE CATASTROPHE BONDS EQUAL TO THE INITIAL MODELED PROBABILITY OF LOSS. FOR THE PERIOD MAY 8, 2007 THROUGH MAY 7, 2008, THE COMPANY WAS

ENTITLED TO BEGIN RECOVERING AMOUNTS UNDER THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT IF THE INDEX-BASED LOSSES IN THE COVERED AREA FOR A SINGLE OCCURRENCE REACHED AN INITIAL ATTACHMENT AMOUNT OF $2.25 BILLION.

THE FULL COVERAGE AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE ON A PROPORTIONAL BASIS UNTIL INDEX-BASED LOSSES REACH A MAXIMUM $3.0 BILLION LIMIT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROGRAM, THE

INDEX-BASED LOSSES ATTACHMENT POINT AND MAXIMUM LIMIT WERE RESET ON MAY 8, 2008. THROUGH MAY 7, 2009, THE COMPANY WILL BE ENTITLED TO BEGIN RECOVERING AMOUNTS UNDER THE REINSURANCE

AGREEMENT IF THE INDEX-BASED LOSSES IN THE COVERED AREA FOR A SINGLE OCCURRENCE REACH AN INITIAL ATTACHMENT AMOUNT OF $2.425 BILLION. THE FULL COVERAGE AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION IS

AVAILABLE ON A PROPORTIONAL BASIS UNTIL INDEX-BASED LOSSES REACH A MAXIMUM $3.22 BILLION LIMIT. THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCURRED ANY LOSSES SUBJECT TO THE AGREEMENT SINCE ITS INCEPTION.

THE

$500 MILLION LIMIT IS SECURED BY A COMBINATION OF ASSETS HELD IN A TRUST AND A TOTAL RETURN SWAP WITH GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL THAT IS GUARANTEED BY THE GOLDMAN SACHS

GROUP, INC. (GOLDMAN SACHS). THE VALUE OF THE TRUST ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS ESTIMATED BY GOLDMAN SACHS TO BE $342 MILLION. SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 2008, ONE

ASSET OF THE TRUST FAILED TO MEET THE INVESTMENT GUIDELINES OF THE TRUST AND, ACCORDINGLY, WAS SOLD ON FEBRUARY 11, 2009. PURSUANT TO THE TOTAL RETURN SWAP, UPON SALE OF THE ASSET, GOLDMAN

SACHS CONTRIBUTED CASH TO THE TRUST EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SALE PROCEEDS OF $53 MILLION AND THE $100 MILLION FACE VALUE OF THE ASSET.

NORTHEAST CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY.

IN ADDITION TO ITS GENERAL CATASTROPHE TREATY AND ITS MULTI-YEAR CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAM,

THE

COMPANY ALSO IS PARTY TO A NORTHEAST GENERAL CATASTROPHE TREATY WHICH PROVIDES UP TO $500 MILLION OF COVERAGE, SUBJECT TO A $2.25 BILLION RETENTION, FOR LOSSES ARISING FROM HURRICANES,

EARTHQUAKES AND WINTER STORM OR FREEZE LOSSES FROM VIRGINIA TO MAINE FOR THE PERIOD JULY 1, 2008 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2009. LOSSES FROM A COVERED EVENT (OCCURRING OVER SEVERAL DAYS) ANYWHERE

IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, THE CARIBBEAN AND MEXICO MAY BE USED TO SATISFY THE RETENTION. RECOVERIES UNDER THE CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAM DESCRIBED ABOVE (IF ANY) WOULD BE FIRST APPLIED TO REDUCE

LOSSES SUBJECT TO THIS TREATY.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACTS.

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 (THE TERRORISM ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO

FEDERAL LAW

AND ESTABLISHED THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM), A TEMPORARY FEDERAL PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THAT PROVIDED FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION

FOR CERTAIN INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN INTEREST. THE PROGRAM WAS SCHEDULED TO

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TERMINATE

ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005 (THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW, REAUTHORIZING THE PROGRAM

THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2007, WHILE REDUCING THE FEDERAL ROLE UNDER THE PROGRAM. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW,

EXTENDING COVERAGE TO INCLUDE DOMESTIC ACTS OF TERRORISM AND REAUTHORIZING THE PROGRAM THROUGH 2014. THE THREE ACTS ARE HEREINAFTER COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "THE ACTS."

IN

ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS AND MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS

AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. THE ANNUAL AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUM IS $100 MILLION THROUGH 2014. THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION CERTAIN OF

THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE: FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE, PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE, HEALTH OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD INSURANCE, AND

REINSURANCE. THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT EXEMPTED FROM COVERAGE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL TYPES OF INSURANCE, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY (OTHER THAN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS'),

SURETY, BURGLARY AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS MULTI-PERIL. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS' COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE ACTS. THE ACTS GENERALLY REQUIRE

THAT ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT FOR 85% OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP. THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT PERCENTAGE IS 85% THROUGH 2014.

THE

DEDUCTIBLE FOR ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS EQUAL TO 20% OF THE INSURER'S DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS FOR COVERED LINES FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM

IS $2.16 BILLION FOR 2009. THE ANNUAL CAP LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE

$100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, PARTICIPATING INSURERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM FOR ADDITIONAL COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES FOR THAT PROGRAM YEAR. THE COMPANY HAS HAD NO

TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED. BECAUSE THE ACTS ARE RELATIVELY NEW AND THEIR INTERPRETATION IS UNTESTED, THERE MAY BE UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW THEY WILL BE APPLIED TO

SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. FURTHER, GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN THE COMPANY'S OWN REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES

FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY IN

FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THIS TYPE OF CATASTROPHIC RISK BY MONITORING AND CONTROLLING TERRORISM RISK AGGREGATIONS TO THE BEST OF ITS ABILITY.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS THAT INCLUDES REVIEW OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS, UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. THE

COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, THE COMPANY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES

FOR REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION. THE RESERVES ARE ALSO REVIEWED REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING RESERVES AND

A DISCUSSION OF UNDERLYING VARIABLES AND RISK FACTORS, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES."

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES (DISCUSSED BY PRODUCT LINE IN THE "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES" SECTION OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATIONS")

ARE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, INFLATION, JUDICIAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF

THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE

UNDERLYING INSURANCE CONTRACT (E.G., CLAIMS-MADE VERSUS OCCURRENCE), CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM, AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INSURED EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE

PROCESS.

THE

COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES FOR UNREPORTED CLAIMS AND DEVELOPMENT ON REPORTED CLAIMS PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT BY ACCIDENT YEAR FOR

EACH TYPE OF EXPOSURE AND BUSINESS UNIT. SIMILARLY, THE COMPANY DERIVES ESTIMATES OF UNPAID LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES PRINCIPALLY FROM ACTUARIAL ANALYSES OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS OF THE

RELATIONSHIP OF LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO LOSSES FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS AND TYPE OF EXPOSURE. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY'S RESERVING METHODS FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION," AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION."

DISCOUNTING

INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ARE CERTAIN RESERVES DISCOUNTED TO THE

PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE LIABILITIES FOR LOSSES FOR MOST LONG-TERM DISABILITY PAYMENTS UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXCESS

INSURANCE, WHICH TOTALED $2.25 BILLION AND $2.09 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007.

RESERVES TOTALING $33 MILLION FOR CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 7%. NO RESERVES FOR SUCH ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS WERE

DISCOUNTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE DEVELOPMENT TABLE

THE TABLE THAT FOLLOWS SETS FORTH THE YEAR-END RESERVES FROM 1998 THROUGH 2008 AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THOSE

RESERVES, PRESENTED ON A HISTORICAL BASIS. THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND REESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR THE YEARS 1998 THROUGH 2003 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE

ACQUISITION OF SPC IN 2004. THE TABLE INCLUDES SPC RESERVES BEGINNING AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

IN

ADDITION, THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS PAID AND REESTIMATED RESERVES IN THE TABLE FOR THE YEARS 1998 TO 2000 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE ACQUISITION OF

NORTHLAND AND COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY. BEGINNING IN 2001, THE TABLE INCLUDES THE RESERVE ACTIVITY OF NORTHLAND AND COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY. THE DATA IN THE TABLE IS PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO AVOID MISINTERPRETATION BY THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS INFORMATION OR FAMILIAR WITH OTHER DATA

COMMONLY REPORTED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE DATA IN THE TABLE IS NOT ACCIDENT YEAR DATA, BUT RATHER A DISPLAY OF 1998 TO 2008 YEAR-END RESERVES AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN

THOSE RESERVES.

FOR

INSTANCE, THE "CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY (REDUNDANCY)" SHOWN IN THE TABLE FOR EACH YEAR REPRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT BY WHICH ORIGINAL ESTIMATES OF RESERVES AS OF THAT

YEAR-END HAVE CHANGED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. ACCORDINGLY, THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY FOR A YEAR RELATES ONLY TO RESERVES AT THAT YEAR-END AND THOSE AMOUNTS ARE NOT ADDITIVE.

EXPRESSED ANOTHER WAY, IF THE ORIGINAL RESERVES AT THE END OF 1998 INCLUDED $4 MILLION FOR A LOSS THAT IS FINALLY PAID IN 2005 FOR $5 MILLION, THE $1 MILLION DEFICIENCY (THE

EXCESS OF THE ACTUAL PAYMENT OF $5 MILLION OVER THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF $4 MILLION)

WOULD

BE INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES IN EACH OF THE YEARS 1998 TO 2004 SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE.

VARIOUS

FACTORS MAY DISTORT THE RE-ESTIMATED RESERVES AND CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCY OR REDUNDANCY SHOWN IN THE TABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE

DEFICIENCIES SHOWN IN THE TABLE ARISE FROM CLAIMS ON POLICIES WRITTEN PRIOR TO THE MID-1980S INVOLVING LIABILITY EXPOSURES SUCH AS ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN THE

POST-1984 PERIOD, THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED MORE STRINGENT UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND POLICY EXCLUSIONS AND HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRACTED OR TERMINATED THE WRITING OF THESE RISKS. SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION," AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION." GENERAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE LIABILITIES IN THE PAST WILL NOT NECESSARILY RECUR IN THE FUTURE.

OTHER

FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE DATA IN THE TABLE INCLUDE THE DISCOUNTING OF CERTAIN RESERVES (AS DISCUSSED ABOVE) AND THE USE OF RETROSPECTIVELY RATED INSURANCE POLICIES. FOR EXAMPLE,

WORKERS' COMPENSATION INDEMNITY RESERVES (TABULAR RESERVES) ARE DISCOUNTED TO REFLECT THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. APPARENT DEFICIENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AS THE DISCOUNT ON THESE WORKERS'

COMPENSATION RESERVES IS ACCRETED AT THE APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATES. ALSO, A PORTION OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN WITH RETROSPECTIVELY RATED INSURANCE POLICIES IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE

LOSS EXPERIENCE IS PRIMARILY BORNE BY THE INSURED. FOR THIS BUSINESS, INCREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING INCREASE IN AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM INSUREDS.

LIKEWISE, DECREASES IN LOSS EXPERIENCE RESULT IN A DECREASE IN RESERVES AND AN OFFSETTING DECREASE IN AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM THESE INSUREDS. THE AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON THESE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED

POLICIES MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CUMULATIVE DEFICIENCIES OR REDUNDANCIES ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS BUT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE TABLE.

BECAUSE

OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL EXTRAPOLATION OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REDUNDANCIES OR DEFICIENCIES IN LOSS RESERVES FROM THE DATA IN THE TABLE.

INCLUDES

RESERVES OF THE NORTHLAND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND COMMERCIAL GUARANTY LLOYDS INSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH WERE ACQUIRED FROM CITIGROUP ON

OCTOBER 1, 2001. ALSO INCLUDES RESERVES OF COMMERCIAL GUARANTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH WAS CONTRIBUTED TO TPC BY CITIGROUP ON OCTOBER 3, 2001. AT DECEMBER 31, 2001,

THESE GROSS RESERVES WERE $867 MILLION, AND NET RESERVES WERE $633 MILLION.

(B)

FOR

YEARS PRIOR TO 2004, EXCLUDES SPC RESERVES, WHICH WERE ACQUIRED ON APRIL 1, 2004. ACCORDINGLY, THE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT (NET RESERVES FOR CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE REESTIMATED AS OF SUBSEQUENT YEARS LESS NET RESERVES RECORDED AT THE END OF THE YEAR, AS ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED) FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2004 RELATES ONLY TO LOSSES RECORDED BY

TPC AND DOES NOT INCLUDE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED BY SPC. FOR 2004 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS, INCLUDES SPC RESERVES AND SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT RECORDED BY SPC. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, SPC GROSS

RESERVES WERE $23,274 MILLION, AND NET RESERVES WERE $15,959 MILLION.

(C)

IN

DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA HOLDINGS LIMITED (UNIONAMERICA), WHICH COMPRISED ITS UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.)-BASED RUNOFF

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES. (UNIONAMERICA WAS ACQUIRED IN 2004 AS PART OF THE MERGER OF SPC AND TPC.) IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE SALE, THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES OF

UNIONAMERICA TOTALED $790 MILLION. AS A RESULT OF THE SALE, THOSE OBLIGATIONS CEASED BEING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE SALE IS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE AS A

REDUCTION IN DECEMBER 31, 2008 NET RESERVES OF $790 MILLION AND AS A $790 MILLION INCREASE IN PAID LOSSES FOR EACH OF THE YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2007 TO REFLECT THE TRANSFER (PAYMENT)

OF THE RESERVES TO THE BUYER, RESULTING IN NO IMPACT TO INCURRED LOSSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESERVES ON STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006, CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (NET OF REINSURANCE) SHOWN IN THE PRECEDING

TABLE, WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP RESERVES), WERE $5 MILLION HIGHER, $30 MILLION HIGHER AND $104 MILLION LOWER,

RESPECTIVELY, THAN THOSE REPORTED IN THE COMPANY'S RESPECTIVE ANNUAL REPORTS FILED WITH INSURANCE REGULATORS, WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES (STATUTORY RESERVES).

THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GAAP AND STATUTORY RESERVES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN GAAP AND STATUTORY ACCOUNTING FOR TWO ITEMS, (1) FEES ASSOCIATED WITH BILLING OF REQUIRED

REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER LARGE DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS, AND (2) THE ACCOUNTING FOR RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE. FOR LARGE DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY PAYS THE DEDUCTIBLE PORTION OF A CASUALTY

INSURANCE CLAIM AND THEN SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE INSURED, PLUS A FEE. THIS FEE IS REPORTED AS FEE INCOME FOR GAAP REPORTING, BUT AS AN OFFSET TO CLAIM EXPENSES PAID FOR STATUTORY REPORTING.

RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES RESULT FROM REINSURANCE PLACED TO COVER LOSSES ON INSURED EVENTS OCCURRING PRIOR TO THE INCEPTION OF A REINSURANCE CONTRACT. FOR GAAP REPORTING, RETROACTIVE

REINSURANCE BALANCES ARE INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND RESULT IN LOWER NET RESERVE AMOUNTS. STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES REQUIRE RETROACTIVE REINSURANCE BALANCES TO BE RECORDED IN OTHER

LIABILITIES AS CONTRA-LIABILITIES RATHER THAN IN LOSS RESERVES.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS ARE SEGREGATED FROM OTHER CLAIMS AND ARE HANDLED SEPARATELY BY THE COMPANY'S SPECIAL LIABILITY GROUP,

A SEPARATE UNIT STAFFED BY DEDICATED LEGAL, CLAIM, FINANCE AND ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, SEE "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION."

INTERCOMPANY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

MOST OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE MEMBERS OF AN INTERCOMPANY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENT.

POOLING ARRANGEMENTS PERMIT THE PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO RELY ON THE CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE POOL'S CAPITAL AND SURPLUS RATHER THAN JUST ON ITS OWN CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, THE

MEMBERS SHARE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INSURANCE BUSINESS THAT IS WRITTEN AND ALLOCATE THE COMBINED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES.

ON

OCTOBER 1, 2007, RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2007, THE NORTHLAND POOL WAS COMMUTED AND TERMINATED. FOUR MEMBERS OF THE FORMER NORTHLAND POOL, CONSISTING OF NORTHLAND

INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHFIELD INSURANCE COMPANY, NORTHLAND CASUALTY COMPANY AND AMERICAN EQUITY SPECIALTY INSURANCE COMPANY, BECAME MEMBERS OF THE TRAVELERS REINSURANCE POOL. THE FIFTH MEMBER OF THE

FORMER NORTHLAND POOL, AMERICAN EQUITY INSURANCE COMPANY, BECAME A 100% REINSURED AFFILIATE OF THE TRAVELERS REINSURANCE POOL. ADDITIONALLY, THE INDIVIDUAL 100% QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS FOR

THREE FORMER 100% REINSURED AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF THE TRAVELERS REINSURANCE POOL (ST. PAUL GUARDIAN INSURANCE COMPANY, ST. PAUL MERCURY INSURANCE COMPANY AND FIDELITY AND GUARANTY

INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS, INC.) WERE COMMUTED AND TERMINATED. THESE THREE COMPANIES ALSO BECAME MEMBERS OF THE TRAVELERS REINSURANCE POOL. ALL OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE RETROACTIVE TO

JANUARY 1, 2007. IN ADDITION, ON OCTOBER 1, 2007, DISCOVER REINSURANCE COMPANY WAS MERGED INTO THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY.

RATINGS

RATINGS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SETTING THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES RATINGS

FROM THE FOLLOWING MAJOR RATING AGENCIES: A.M. BEST COMPANY (A.M. BEST), FITCH RATINGS (FITCH), MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODY'S) AND STANDARD & POOR'S CORP.

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(S&P).

RATING AGENCIES TYPICALLY ISSUE TWO TYPES OF RATINGS: CLAIMS-PAYING (OR FINANCIAL STRENGTH) RATINGS WHICH ASSESS AN INSURER'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND DEBT

RATINGS WHICH ASSESS A COMPANY'S PROSPECTS FOR REPAYING ITS DEBTS AND ASSIST LENDERS IN SETTING INTEREST RATES AND TERMS FOR A COMPANY'S SHORT- AND LONG-TERM BORROWING NEEDS. AGENCY

RATINGS ARE NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY, SELL OR HOLD ANY SECURITY, AND THEY MAY BE REVISED OR WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME BY THE RATING AGENCY. EACH AGENCY'S RATING SHOULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY

OTHER AGENCY'S RATING. THE SYSTEM AND THE NUMBER OF RATING CATEGORIES CAN VARY WIDELY FROM RATING AGENCY TO RATING AGENCY. CUSTOMERS USUALLY FOCUS ON CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS, WHILE CREDITORS FOCUS ON

DEBT RATINGS. INVESTORS USE BOTH TO EVALUATE A COMPANY'S OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH. THE RATINGS ISSUED ON THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES BY ANY OF THESE AGENCIES ARE ANNOUNCED PUBLICLY AND ARE

AVAILABLE ON THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE AND FROM THE AGENCIES.

THE

COMPANY'S INSURANCE OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS-PAYING OR DEBT RATINGS. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD

EXPERIENCE A REDUCED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD BE IMPACTED BY A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S

DEBT RATINGS. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR HIGHER BORROWING COSTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID

INTERMEDIATE-TERM TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS, TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS, AND TAXABLE CORPORATE AND U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE

DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES ARE EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE AND DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT OF THE DURATION OF THE FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO GENERALLY PRODUCES A DURATION THAT MODESTLY EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S NET INSURANCE

LIABILITIES.

THE

PRIMARY GOALS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS ARE TO SATISFY THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES, MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK EMBEDDED IN THOSE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND

MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER FLUCTUATIONS IN PROJECTED LIABILITY CASH FLOWS. GENERALLY, THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY'S FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO

ADEQUATELY FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EXACT CASH FLOW MATCH IN EACH PERIOD, THE SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE BY WHICH THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED

INCOME PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES, PLUS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS PROVIDES ASSURANCE

OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUND THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO INVESTS MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, VENTURE CAPITAL (THROUGH DIRECT OWNERSHIP AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS), PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT

VENTURES, REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, MORTGAGE LOANS AND TRADING SECURITIES. THESE INVESTMENT CLASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER RETURNS BUT ALSO INVOLVE VARYING DEGREES

OF RISK, INCLUDING LESS STABLE RATES OF RETURN AND LESS LIQUIDITY.

REGULATION

STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION

TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE VARIOUS STATES AND JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY TRANSACT BUSINESS. THE

EXTENT OF REGULATION VARIES, BUT GENERALLY DERIVES FROM STATUTES THAT DELEGATE REGULATORY, SUPERVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO A DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN EACH STATE. THE REGULATION,

SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION RELATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED, THE LICENSING OF INSURERS AND THEIR AGENTS, THE NATURE OF AND LIMITATIONS ON

INVESTMENTS, PREMIUM RATES, RESTRICTIONS ON THE SIZE OF RISKS THAT MAY BE INSURED UNDER A SINGLE POLICY, RESERVES AND PROVISIONS FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS, LOSSES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS, DEPOSITS OF

SECURITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF POLICYHOLDERS, APPROVAL OF POLICY FORMS AND THE REGULATION OF MARKET CONDUCT, INCLUDING THE USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION IN UNDERWRITING AS WELL AS OTHER UNDERWRITING AND

CLAIMS PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, MANY STATES HAVE ENACTED VARIATIONS OF COMPETITIVE RATEMAKING LAWS, WHICH ALLOW INSURERS TO SET CERTAIN PREMIUM RATES FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF INSURANCE WITHOUT HAVING TO

OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT. STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS ALSO CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND MARKET CONDUCT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

REQUIRE THE FILING OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER REPORTS ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS. TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE COLLECTIVELY LICENSED TO

INSURANCE REGULATION CONCERNING DIVIDENDS.

TRV'S PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT AND

MINNESOTA. THE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF BOTH STATES APPLICABLE TO TRV'S SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRE NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND, THAT

TOGETHER WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURER'S CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURER'S NET

INCOME FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND BY STATE REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR

PAYMENT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.

THE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE RESTRICTIVE,

LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

RATE AND RULE APPROVALS.

TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO EACH STATE'S LAWS AND REGULATIONS

REGARDING RATE AND RULE APPROVALS. THE APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE USED BY STATES TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT RATES ARE NOT EXCESSIVE, INADEQUATE, UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY, OR USED TO

ENGAGE IN UNFAIR PRICE COMPETITION. AN INSURER'S ABILITY TO INCREASE RATES AND THE RELATIVE TIMING OF THE PROCESS ARE DEPENDENT UPON EACH RESPECTIVE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS.

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXITING GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS AND/OR CANCELING OR NONRENEWING POLICIES.

SEVERAL STATES HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH MAY

IMPACT THE

TIMING AND/OR THE ABILITY OF AN INSURER TO EITHER DISCONTINUE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE ITS WRITINGS IN THAT STATE. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TYPICALLY REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE, AND IN SOME INSTANCES

INSURANCE DEPARTMENT APPROVAL, PRIOR TO DISCONTINUING A LINE OF BUSINESS OR WITHDRAWING FROM THAT STATE, AND THEY ALLOW INSURERS TO CANCEL OR NON-RENEW CERTAIN POLICIES ONLY FOR CERTAIN

SPECIFIED REASONS.

ASSESSMENTS FOR GUARANTY FUNDS AND SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY POOLING AND REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS.

VIRTUALLY ALL STATES

REQUIRE

INSURERS LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS IN THEIR STATE, INCLUDING TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, TO BEAR A PORTION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED BY SOME CLAIMANTS BECAUSE OF THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER INSURERS. MANY

STATES ALSO HAVE LAWS THAT ESTABLISHED SECOND-INJURY FUNDS TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO INJURED EMPLOYEES FOR AGGRAVATION OF A PRIOR CONDITION OR INJURY.

TRV'S

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNED RISK POOLS, PRINCIPALLY INVOLVING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, PROPERTY

WINDPOOLS IN STATES PRONE TO PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM HURRICANES, AND FAIR PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE VARIOUS INSURANCE COVERAGES TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE THAT

COVERAGE IN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET.

ASSESSMENTS

MAY INCLUDE ANY CHARGE MANDATED BY STATUTE OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY THAT IS RELATED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES. EXAMPLES OF SUCH MECHANISMS INCLUDE, BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND, FLORIDA CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION, LOUISIANA CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION AND THE TEXAS WINDSTORM INSURANCE

ASSOCIATION. AMOUNTS PAYABLE OR PAID AS A RESULT OF ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE IN SUBSTANCE REINSURANCE, INCLUDING CERTAIN INVOLUNTARY POOLS WHERE INSURERS ARE REQUIRED TO ASSUME PREMIUMS AND LOSSES FROM

THOSE POOLS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS REINSURANCE (E.G., NATIONAL WORKERS' COMPENSATION REINSURANCE POOL). AMOUNTS RELATED TO ASSESSMENTS FROM ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE NOT REINSURANCE ARE REPORTED AS A

COMPONENT OF "GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES." FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING ASSESSMENTS FOR GUARANTY FUNDS AND SECOND-INJURY FUNDS AND OTHER MANDATORY POOLING AND REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS

INCLUDING STATE-FUNDING MECHANISMS, SEE "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS."

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSURANCE REGULATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM.

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) DEVELOPED THE INSURANCE REGULATORY

INFORMATION

SYSTEM (IRIS) TO HELP STATE REGULATORS IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION. FINANCIAL EXAMINERS REVIEW ANNUAL STATEMENTS AND KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS BASED ON YEAR-END DATA.

THESE RATIOS ASSIST STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS IN EXECUTING THEIR STATUTORY MANDATE TO OVERSEE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. EACH RATIO HAS AN ESTABLISHED "USUAL RANGE" OF RESULTS.

A RATIO RESULT FALLING OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGE OF IRIS RATIOS, HOWEVER, IS NOT CONSIDERED A FAILING RESULT; RATHER, UNUSUAL VALUES ARE VIEWED AS PART OF THE REGULATORY EARLY MONITORING SYSTEM.

FURTHERMORE, IN SOME YEARS, IT MAY NOT BE UNUSUAL FOR FINANCIALLY SOUND COMPANIES TO HAVE SEVERAL RATIOS WITH RESULTS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES. GENERALLY, AN INSURANCE COMPANY WILL BECOME SUBJECT TO

REGULATORY SCRUTINY IF IT FALLS OUTSIDE THE USUAL RANGES OF FOUR OR MORE OF THE RATIOS.

BASED

ON PRELIMINARY 2008 IRIS RATIOS CALCULATED BY THE COMPANY, THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY AND THE STANDARD FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE ON ONE IRIS

RATIO, DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES. TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY OF AMERICA HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE IRIS RATIO DUE TO

REDUCED DIVIDENDS PAID TO ITS PARENT COMPANY IN 2008. FIRST TRENTON INDEMNITY COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR TWO IRIS RATIOS DUE TO INCREASED DIVIDENDS PAID TO ITS PARENT COMPANY IN

2008. TRAVELERS AUTO INSURANCE CO. OF NEW JERSEY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE IRIS RATIO DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF A CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION FROM ITS PARENT COMPANY. SEVERAL ADDITIONAL

COMPANIES HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR ONE IRIS RATIO DUE TO INCREASED DIRECT WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN THESE COMPANIES. IN 2007, ST. PAUL MERCURY INSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE

THE NORMAL RANGE ON FOUR OF THE IRIS RATIOS, AND ST. PAUL GUARDIAN INSURANCE COMPANY HAD RESULTS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RANGE ON THREE OF THE IRIS RATIOS. THESE RESULTS WERE DUE TO THESE COMPANIES

BECOMING TRAVELERS REINSURANCE POOL PARTICIPANTS IN 2007. PREVIOUSLY, THESE COMPANIES HAD BEEN 100% REINSURED BY THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY, ONE OF THE TRAVELERS REINSURANCE POOL PARTICIPANTS. IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR NEW PARTICIPATION, ST. PAUL MERCURY INSURANCE COMPANY AND ST. PAUL GUARDIAN INSURANCE COMPANY RECEIVED CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF $30 MILLION AND

$10 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FROM THEIR PARENT COMPANY, ST. PAUL FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY, IN 2007.

MANAGEMENT

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE REGULATORY ACTION AS A RESULT OF THE 2008 IRIS RATIO RESULTS. IN ALL INSTANCES IN PRIOR YEARS, REGULATORS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED UPON FOLLOW-UP

THAT NO REGULATORY ACTION WAS REQUIRED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SIMILAR RESULTS COULD OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL (RBC) REQUIREMENTS.

THE NAIC HAS AN RBC REQUIREMENT FOR MOST PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE RBC

REQUIREMENT DETERMINES MINIMUM CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS AND IS INTENDED TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS. UNDER LAWS ADOPTED BY INDIVIDUAL STATES, INSURERS HAVING TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED BY

THE RBC CALCULATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF REGULATORY ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL INADEQUACY.

THE

FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE AMONG ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE TO

USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, ALL OF TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THE RBC REQUIREMENT.

INVESTMENT REGULATION.

INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTMENTS MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH PRESCRIBE THE KIND, QUALITY

AND

CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS. IN GENERAL, THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERMIT INVESTMENTS IN FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS, CORPORATE BONDS, PREFERRED AND COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES, MORTGAGE

LOANS, REAL ESTATE AND CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENTS, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED LIMITS AND CERTAIN OTHER QUALIFICATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS.

AGENT AND BROKER COMPENSATION.

AS PART OF INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS, THE COMPANY RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION FROM A NUMBER OF REGULATORS. THE AREAS OF PENDING INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE METHOD BY WHICH BROKERS AND AGENTS ARE COMPENSATED.

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY COOPERATED WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH SEVERAL OF THESE REGULATORS TO RESOLVE ISSUES RELATED TO BROKER AND AGENT

COMPENSATION. AS A RESULT OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS DISCONTINUED PAYING CONTINGENT COMMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ON A NUMBER OF INSURANCE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING EXCESS CASUALTY AND

UMBRELLA, PERSONAL INSURANCE, BOILER AND MACHINERY, FINANCIAL GUARANTY, FIDELITY AND BURGLARY & THEFT. THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR THESE LINES OF

BUSINESS THAT COMPENSATE BROKERS AND AGENTS IN A MANNER THAT DIFFERENTIATES FOR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY OFFERED

AN OPTIONAL FIXED COMMISSION PROGRAM IN THE U.S. FOR MOST COMMERCIAL INSURANCE LINES.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

TRV'S INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SUBSIDIARIES BASED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED AND TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND

SURETY COMPANY OF EUROPE LIMITED, ARE REGULATED BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (FSA). THE FSA'S PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES ARE TO MAINTAIN MARKET CONFIDENCE, PROMOTE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE

FINANCIAL SYSTEM, PROTECT CONSUMERS, AND FIGHT FINANCIAL CRIME. TRV'S MANAGING AGENT (TRAVELERS SYNDICATE MANAGEMENT LTD.) OF ITS LLOYD'S SYNDICATE IS ALSO REGULATED BY THE FSA, WHICH HAS

DELEGATED CERTAIN REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE COUNCIL OF LLOYD'S.

THROUGH

LLOYD'S, TRV IS LICENSED TO WRITE BUSINESS IN OVER 70 COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BY VIRTUE OF LLOYD'S INTERNATIONAL LICENSES. IN EACH SUCH COUNTRY, TRV IS SUBJECT TO THE LAWS

AND INSURANCE REGULATION OF THAT COUNTRY. IN 2007, A TRV SUBSIDIARY, TRAVELERS CASUALTY AND SURETY COMPANY, ESTABLISHED A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN CHINA. THE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IS REGULATED BY THE

CHINA INSURANCE REGULATORY COMMISSION. IN ADDITION, IN 2007, TRV'S LLOYD'S MANAGING OPERATIONS AGENCY ESTABLISHED A SERVICE COMPANY IN SINGAPORE, THE UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS OF WHICH ARE REGULATED BY

THE MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE.

TRV'S

INSURANCE OPERATIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ARE REGULATED BY THE IRISH FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATORY AUTHORITY. IN CANADA, THE CONDUCT OF TRV'S INSURANCE BUSINESS IS REGULATED

BY THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT, WHICH REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVELS OF CAPITAL DEPENDING ON THE

TYPE AND AMOUNT OF INSURANCE POLICIES IN FORCE.

TRV'S

BRANCH IN RUNOFF IN AUSTRALIA IS REGULATED BY THE AUSTRALIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY.

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES

AS A HOLDING COMPANY, TRV IS NOT REGULATED AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY. HOWEVER, SINCE TRV OWNS CAPITAL STOCK IN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, IT

IS SUBJECT TO STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER LAWS, OF EACH OF ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES' STATES OF DOMICILE. ALL HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES, AS WELL AS OTHER LAWS,

REQUIRE DISCLOSURE AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, PRIOR APPROVAL OF MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND AN AFFILIATE. THE HOLDING COMPANY STATUTES AND OTHER LAWS ALSO REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PRIOR APPROVAL OF AN ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF A DOMESTIC INSURER, SOME TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AFFILIATES AND THE PAYMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS.

INSURANCE REGULATIONS CONCERNING CHANGE OF CONTROL.

MANY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY LAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE ADVANCE

APPROVAL BY STATE

AGENCIES OF ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT IS DOMICILED, OR, IN SOME CASES, HAVING SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS THAT IT IS DEEMED TO BE COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED, IN THAT STATE.

THE

LAWS OF MANY STATES ALSO CONTAIN PROVISIONS REQUIRING PRE-NOTIFICATION TO STATE AGENCIES PRIOR TO ANY CHANGE IN CONTROL OF A NON-DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY

ADMITTED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN THAT STATE. WHILE THESE PRE-NOTIFICATION STATUTES DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE STATE AGENCY TO DISAPPROVE THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, THEY DO AUTHORIZE ISSUANCE OF

CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS WITH RESPECT TO THE NON-DOMESTIC INSURER IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT SOME CONDITIONS, SUCH AS UNDUE MARKET CONCENTRATION, WOULD RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION.

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANY

TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF ANY OF TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD GENERALLY REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATES IN

WHICH THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED OR COMMERCIALLY DOMICILED. THEY MAY ALSO REQUIRE PRE-ACQUISITION NOTIFICATION IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED PRE-ACQUISITION

NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS AND IN WHICH SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ADMITTED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS.

ONE

OF TRV'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND ITS OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S ARE DOMICILED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. INSURERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES AND MARKETS ACT OF 2000 INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. SOME OF TRV'S OTHER INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN, OR AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT INSURANCE

BUSINESS IN, CANADA. AUTHORIZED INSURERS IN CANADA ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OF CONTROL RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 407 OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ACT, INCLUDING APPROVAL OF THE OFFICE OF THE

SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THESE

REQUIREMENTS MAY DETER, DELAY OR PREVENT TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING THE CONTROL OF OR THE OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO TRV'S

SHAREHOLDERS.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

AS A LARGE PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ENTERPRISE, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO MANY RISKS. THESE RISKS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTS

WITHIN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. SINCE CERTAIN RISKS CAN BE CORRELATED WITH OTHER RISKS, AN EVENT OR A SERIES OF EVENTS CAN IMPACT MULTIPLE AREAS OF THE COMPANY SIMULTANEOUSLY AND HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. THESE EXPOSURES REQUIRE AN ENTITY-WIDE VIEW OF RISK AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON ALL

ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MANAGE ITS RISK-TAKING TO BE WITHIN ITS RISK APPETITE IN A PRUDENT EFFORT TO CREATE AND PRESERVE VALUE FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S

CONSTITUENTS. THIS APPROACH TO COMPANY-WIDE RISK EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT IS COMMONLY CALLED ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM). ERM ACTIVITIES INVOLVE BOTH THE IDENTIFICATION AND

ASSESSMENT OF A BROAD RANGE OF RISKS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLANS TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE SUCH RISKS.

ERM

AT THE COMPANY HAS BEEN OPERATIONAL FOR MANY YEARS AND INCORPORATES RISK-BASED ANALYTICS, REPORTING AND FEEDBACK AMONG THE VARIOUS DISCIPLINES THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE UNDERWRITING, CLAIM, REINSURANCE, INVESTMENT, LEGAL, REGULATORY, ACTUARIAL, FINANCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS. BOARD OVERSIGHT OF ERM IS PROVIDED BY THE RISK

COMMITTEE. IN ADDITION TO THE DAY-TO-DAY RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS UNITS, OTHER KEY INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS INCLUDE THE MANAGEMENT

COMMITTEE (COMPRISED OF THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE OTHER MOST SENIOR MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT), THE RISK COMMITTEE OF MANAGEMENT, THE CREDIT COMMITTEE, THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER,

THE BUSINESS CONDUCT OFFICER, THE CORPORATE ACTUARIAL GROUP, THE INTERNAL AUDIT GROUP, THE ACCOUNTING POLICY GROUP, THE ENTERPRISE UNDERWRITING GROUP AND MANY OTHERS.

A

SENIOR EXECUTIVE OVERSEES THE ERM PROCESS. THE MISSION OF THIS EXECUTIVE IS TO FACILITATE RISK ASSESSMENT AND TO COLLABORATE IN IMPLEMENTING RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. ANOTHER

STRATEGIC ERM OBJECTIVE INCLUDES WORKING ACROSS THE COMPANY TO ENHANCE EFFECTIVE AND REALISTIC RISK MODELING CAPABILITIES AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S OVERALL EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE ITS PORTFOLIO

OF RISKS TO BE WITHIN ITS RISK APPETITE.

THE

COMPANY'S ERM EFFORTS BUILD UPON ITS FOUNDATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL. ERM EXPANDS THE INTERNAL CONTROL OBJECTIVES OF EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT OPERATIONS, RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, TO FOSTERING, LEADING AND SUPPORTING AN INTEGRATED, RISK-BASED CULTURE WITHIN THE COMPANY THAT FOCUSES ON VALUE CREATION AND

PRESERVATION. HOWEVER, INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND ERM CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF ANY CONTROL SYSTEM

MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. AS A RESULT, THE POSSIBILITY OF MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS REMAINS IN

SPITE OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT RISK MANAGEMENT EFFORTS. AN INVESTOR SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET

CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION

IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, NO MATERIAL PART OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS DEPENDENT UPON A

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOSSARY OF SELECTED INSURANCE TERMS

ACCIDENT YEAR

THE ANNUAL CALENDAR ACCOUNTING PERIOD IN WHICH LOSS EVENTS OCCURRED, REGARDLESS OF WHEN THE LOSSES ARE ACTUALLY REPORTED, BOOKED OR PAID.

ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS

UNASSIGNED SURPLUS AS OF THE MOST RECENT STATUTORY ANNUAL REPORT REDUCED BY TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THAT YEAR'S

UNREALIZED APPRECIATION IN VALUE OR REVALUATION OF ASSETS OR UNREALIZED PROFITS ON INVESTMENTS, AS DEFINED IN THAT REPORT.

ADMITTED INSURER

A COMPANY LICENSED TO TRANSACT INSURANCE BUSINESS WITHIN A STATE.

ANNUITY

A CONTRACT THAT PAYS A PERIODIC BENEFIT OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF A PERSON (THE ANNUITANT), THE LIVES OF TWO OR

MORE PERSONS OR FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME.

ASSIGNED RISK POOLS

REINSURANCE POOLS WHICH COVER RISKS FOR THOSE UNABLE TO PURCHASE INSURANCE IN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. POSSIBLE

REASONS FOR THIS INABILITY INCLUDE THE RISK BEING TOO GREAT OR THE PROFIT BEING TOO SMALL UNDER THE REQUIRED INSURANCE RATE STRUCTURE. THE COSTS OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE POOLS ARE CHARGED BACK TO INSURANCE CARRIERS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR

DIRECT WRITINGS.

ASSUMED REINSURANCE

INSURANCE RISKS ACQUIRED FROM A CEDING COMPANY.

AVERAGE VALUE ANALYSIS

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD USED TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT

YEAR/PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID LOSSES.

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT AVERAGE CLAIM VALUES ARE STABLE AND PREDICTABLE OVER TIME FOR A

PARTICULAR COHORT OF CLAIMS. THE METHOD IS UTILIZED MOST OFTEN WHERE ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS ARE KNOWN OR RELIABLY ESTIMABLE FAIRLY EARLY AFTER THE START OF AN ACCIDENT YEAR AND AVERAGE VALUES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE FROM ONE YEAR TO THE

NEXT.

ULTIMATE LOSSES UNDER THE METHOD EQUAL THE KNOWN OR ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS TIMES THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE

VALUE. ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS ARE FREQUENTLY BASED ON A CLAIM COUNT DEVELOPMENT METHOD, ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THE PAID AND CASE INCURRED DEVELOPMENT METHODS MENTIONED ELSEWHERE IN THIS GLOSSARY BUT USING CLAIM COUNT RATHER THAN CLAIM

DOLLAR DATA. THE AVERAGE VALUES CAN BE BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS FROM PAST CLOSED CLAIMS, OR BACKED INTO FROM ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES DIVIDED BY ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM COUNTS, OR SOME OTHER APPROACH. WHEN THE AVERAGE VALUES ARE CALCULATED FROM

ULTIMATE LOSS ESTIMATES, THE RESULTING ESTIMATED AVERAGES MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH OTHER DATA/ANALYSES.

BORNHUETTER-FERGUSON METHOD

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT

LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE OUTSTANDING LOSSES.

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT THE HISTORICAL RATIO OF ADDITIONAL CLAIM ACTIVITY TO EARNED PREMIUM FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT

LINE COMPONENT/AGE-TO-AGE PERIOD IS STABLE AND PREDICTABLE. IT IMPLICITLY ASSUMES THAT THE ACTUAL ACTIVITY TO DATE FOR PAST PERIODS FOR THAT COHORT IS NOT A CREDIBLE PREDICTOR OF FUTURE ACTIVITY FOR THAT COHORT, OR AT LEAST IS NOT CREDIBLE ENOUGH TO

OVERRIDE THE "A PRIORI" ASSUMPTION AS TO FUTURE ACTIVITY. IT MAY BE APPLIED TO EITHER PAID OR CASE INCURRED CLAIM DATA. IT IS USED MOST OFTEN WHERE THE CLAIM DATA IS SPARSE AND/OR VOLATILE AND FOR RELATIVELY YOUNG COHORTS WITH LOW VOLUMES AND/OR DATA

CREDIBILITY.

TO ILLUSTRATE, THE METHOD MAY ASSUME THAT THE RATIO OF ADDITIONAL PAID LOSSES FROM THE 12 TO 24 MONTH PERIOD

FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR IS 10% OF THE ORIGINAL "A PRIORI" EXPECTED LOSSES FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR. THE ORIGINAL "A PRIORI" EXPECTED LOSSES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON THE ORIGINAL LOSS RATIO ASSUMPTION FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR, WITH SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENT AS

FACTS DEVELOP.

THE ULTIMATE LOSSES EQUAL ACTUAL ACTIVITY TO DATE PLUS THE EXPECTED VALUES FOR FUTURE PERIODS.

BROKER

ONE WHO NEGOTIATES CONTRACTS OF INSURANCE OR REINSURANCE ON BEHALF OF AN INSURED PARTY, RECEIVING A COMMISSION

FROM THE INSURER OR REINSURER FOR PLACEMENT AND OTHER SERVICES RENDERED.

CAPACITY

THE PERCENTAGE OF SURPLUS, OR THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE, THAT AN INSURER OR REINSURER IS WILLING OR ABLE TO

PLACE AT RISK. CAPACITY MAY APPLY TO A SINGLE RISK, A PROGRAM, A LINE OF BUSINESS OR AN ENTIRE BOOK OF BUSINESS. CAPACITY MAY BE CONSTRAINED BY LEGAL RESTRICTIONS, CORPORATE RESTRICTIONS OR INDIRECT RESTRICTIONS.

CAPTIVE

A CLOSELY-HELD INSURANCE COMPANY WHOSE PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THE COMPANY'S OWNERS

OR THEIR AFFILIATES.

CASE-INCURRED DEVELOPMENT METHOD

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT

LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID LOSSES.

THE APPROACH IS THE SAME AS THAT DESCRIBED IN THIS GLOSSARY UNDER THE "PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD," BUT BASED

ON THE GROWTH IN CUMULATIVE CASE-INCURRED LOSSES (I.E., THE SUM OF CLAIM-ADJUSTOR INCURRED ESTIMATES FOR CLAIMS IN THE COHORT) RATHER THAN PAID LOSSES. THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT CUMULATIVE CASE INCURRED LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF

CLAIMS WILL GROW IN A STABLE, PREDICTABLE PATTERN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR, BASED ON THE AGE OF THE COHORT.

CASE RESERVES

CLAIM DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE PAYMENTS TO BE MADE ON EACH SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL REPORTED

CLAIM.

37

COVER PROPERTY INSURANCE LOSSES BUT CAN BE WRITTEN TO COVER CASUALTY INSURANCE LOSSES SUCH AS FROM WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICIES.

TO NET PREMIUMS EARNED. A COMBINED RATIO UNDER 100% GENERALLY INDICATES AN UNDERWRITING PROFIT. A COMBINED RATIO OVER 100% GENERALLY INDICATES AN UNDERWRITING LOSS.

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL POLICIES

REFERS TO POLICIES WHICH COVER BOTH PROPERTY AND THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY EXPOSURES.

COMMUTATION AGREEMENT

AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN A REINSURER AND A CEDING COMPANY WHEREBY THE REINSURER PAYS AN AGREED-UPON AMOUNT IN

NEW CONTRACTS AND ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO ACHIEVE A MATCHING OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES WHEN REPORTED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP).

DEFICIENCY

WITH REGARD TO RESERVES FOR A GIVEN LIABILITY, A DEFICIENCY EXISTS WHEN IT IS ESTIMATED OR DETERMINED THAT THE

RESERVES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT VALUE OF THE RELATED LIABILITIES. WHERE THE DEFICIENCY IS THE RESULT OF AN ESTIMATE, THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF DEFICIENCY (OR EVEN THE FINDING OF WHETHER OR NOT A DEFICIENCY EXISTS) MAY CHANGE AS

NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

DEMAND SURGE

SIGNIFICANT SHORT-TERM INCREASES IN BUILDING MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS DUE TO A SHARP INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR THOSE

MATERIALS AND SERVICES, COMMONLY AS A RESULT OF A LARGE CATASTROPHE RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT WIDESPREAD PROPERTY DAMAGE.

(VOLUNTARY) MARKET. FAIR PLANS ARE SET UP ON A STATE-BY-STATE BASIS TO COVER ONLY THOSE RISKS IN THAT STATE. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE "RESIDUAL MARKET (INVOLUNTARY BUSINESS)."

FIDELITY AND SURETY PROGRAMS

FIDELITY INSURANCE COVERAGE PROTECTS AN INSURED FOR LOSS DUE TO EMBEZZLEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS BY AN

EMPLOYEE. SURETY IS A THREE-PARTY AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE INSURER AGREES TO PAY A SECOND PARTY OR MAKE COMPLETE AN OBLIGATION IN RESPONSE TO THE DEFAULT, ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF AN INSURED.

GROUND-UP ANALYSIS

A METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT LINE

COMPONENT. IT INVOLVES ANALYZING THE EXPOSURE AT AN INDIVIDUAL INSURED LEVEL AND THEN THROUGH THE USE OF DETERMINISTIC OR STOCHASTIC SCENARIOS AND/OR SIMULATIONS, ESTIMATING THE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR THOSE INSUREDS. THE TOTAL LOSSES FOR THE COHORT ARE

THEN THE SUM OF THE LOSSES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL INSURED.

IN PRACTICE, THE METHOD IS SOMETIMES SIMPLIFIED BY PERFORMING THE INDIVIDUAL INSURED ANALYSIS ONLY FOR THE LARGER

INSUREDS, WITH THE COSTS FOR THE SMALLER INSUREDS ESTIMATED VIA SAMPLING APPROACHES (EXTRAPOLATED TO THE REST OF THE SMALLER INSURED POPULATION) OR AGGREGATE APPROACHES (USING ASSUMPTIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE GROUND-UP LARGER INSURED

ANALYSIS).

OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) ON A PER SHARE BASIS.

OPERATING RETURN ON EQUITY

THE RATIO OF OPERATING INCOME TO AVERAGE EQUITY EXCLUDING NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES AND

PAID DEVELOPMENT METHOD

AN ACTUARIAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT YEAR/PRODUCT

LINE COMPONENT. IF THE PAID-TO-DATE LOSSES ARE THEN SUBTRACTED FROM THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE LOSSES, THE RESULT IS AN INDICATION OF THE UNPAID LOSSES.

THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT CUMULATIVE PAID LOSSES FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS WILL GROW IN A STABLE,

PREDICTABLE PATTERN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR, BASED ON THE AGE OF THE COHORT. THESE AGE-TO-AGE GROWTH FACTORS ARE SOMETIMES CALLED "LINK RATIOS."

FOR EXAMPLE, IF CUMULATIVE PAID LOSSES FOR A PRODUCT LINE XYZ FOR ACCIDENT YEAR 2004 WERE $100 AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004 (12 MONTHS AFTER THE START OF THAT ACCIDENT YEAR), THEN GREW TO $120 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 (24 MONTHS AFTER THE START), THE LINK RATIO FOR THAT ACCIDENT YEAR FROM 12 TO 24 MONTHS WOULD BE 1.20. IF THE LINK

RATIO FOR OTHER RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS FROM 12 TO 24 MONTHS FOR THAT PRODUCT LINE WERE ALSO AT OR AROUND 1.20, THEN THE METHOD WOULD ASSUME A SIMILAR RESULT FOR THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR, I.E., THAT IT TOO WOULD HAVE ITS CUMULATIVE PAID

LOSSES GROW 120% FROM THE 12 MONTH TO 24 MONTH VALUATION.

THIS IS REPEATED FOR EACH AGE-TO-AGE PERIOD INTO THE FUTURE UNTIL THE AGE-TO-AGE LINK RATIOS FOR FUTURE PERIODS

ARE ASSUMED TO BE 1.0 (I.E., THE AGE AT WHICH CUMULATIVE LOSSES ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE STOPPED GROWING).

A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR'S CUMULATIVE LOSSES ARE THEN PROJECTED TO ULTIMATE BY MULTIPLYING CURRENT CUMULATIVE LOSSES

BY SUCCESSIVE AGE-TO-AGE LINK RATIOS UP TO THAT FUTURE AGE WHERE GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO END. FOR EXAMPLE, IF GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO END AT 60 MONTHS, THEN THE ULTIMATE INDICATION FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR WITH CUMULATIVE LOSSES AT 12 MONTHS EQUALS

THOSE LOSSES TIMES A 12 TO 24 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A 24 TO 36 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A 36 TO 48 MONTH LINK RATIO, TIMES A 48 TO 60 MONTH LINK RATIO.

ADVANCED APPLICATIONS OF THE METHOD INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGING CONDITIONS DURING THE HISTORICAL PERIOD AND

ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE FUTURE.

THE APPROACH IS THE SAME AS THAT DESCRIBED IN THIS GLOSSARY UNDER THE "PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT METHOD", BUT BASED

ON THE GROWTH IN CUMULATIVE CLAIM COUNTS RATHER THAN PAID LOSSES. THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE METHOD IS THAT CUMULATIVE CLAIM COUNTS FOR A GIVEN COHORT OF CLAIMS WILL GROW IN A STABLE, PREDICTABLE PATTERN FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR, BASED ON THE AGE OF THE

COHORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO.

CATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO

RAISE

CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE.

OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF CATASTROPHES. CATASTROPHES

CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, WILDFIRES AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. CATASTROPHES CAN ALSO BE

MAN-MADE, SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS) OR A CONSEQUENCE OF WAR OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE GEOGRAPHIC

DISTRIBUTION OF OUR BUSINESS SUBJECTS US TO CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES, WHICH

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: HURRICANES FROM MAINE THROUGH TEXAS; TORNADOES THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES AND SOUTHEAST; EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA, THE NEW MADRID REGION AND THE PACIFIC

NORTHWEST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA; AND WILDFIRES, PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHWEST.

THE

INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT IN RECENT YEARS, CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS HAVE ADDED TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND

FREQUENCY OF NATURAL DISASTERS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, HURRICANES, TORNADOES, OTHER STORMS AND FIRES) IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD AND CREATED ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO FUTURE TRENDS AND

EXPOSURES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN RECENT YEARS HURRICANE ACTIVITY HAS IMPACTED AREAS FURTHER INLAND THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED, THUS EXPANDING OUR OVERALL HURRICANE EXPOSURE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE

FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF NATURAL AND MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD INCREASE. THE CATASTROPHE MODELING TOOLS THAT WE USE TO HELP MANAGE CERTAIN OF OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES ARE BASED

ON ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ERROR AND MIS-ESTIMATION AND MAY PRODUCE ESTIMATES THAT ARE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN ACTUAL RESULTS. OUR EXPANSION INTO NEW GEOGRAPHICAL

AREAS AS WELL AS CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS COULD CAUSE OUR CATASTROPHE MODELS TO BE EVEN LESS PREDICTIVE, THUS LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES. SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCATASTROPHE MODELING."

THE

EXTENT OF LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. STATES HAVE FROM TIME

TO TIME PASSED LEGISLATION, AND REGULATORS HAVE TAKEN ACTION, THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF LIMITING THE ABILITY OF INSURERS TO MANAGE CATASTROPHE RISK, SUCH AS LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INSURERS FROM REDUCING

EXPOSURES OR WITHDRAWING FROM CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS OR MANDATING THAT INSURERS PARTICIPATE IN RESIDUAL MARKETS. PARTICIPATION IN RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS HAS RESULTED IN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO

RESULT IN, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS TO INSURERS, INCLUDING US, AND, IN CERTAIN STATES, THOSE LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS MAY NOT BE COMMENSURATE WITH OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE IN THOSE STATES. IF

OUR COMPETITORS LEAVE THOSE STATES HAVING RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS, REMAINING INSURERS, INCLUDING US, MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN LOSSES OR ASSESSMENTS FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE. IN

ADDITION, FOLLOWING CATASTROPHES, THERE ARE SOMETIMES LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES AND COURT DECISIONS WHICH SEEK TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CATASTROPHE CLAIMS BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE

POLICIES. ALSO, OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICING TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO OFFSET RISING COSTS OF CATASTROPHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, REQUIRES APPROVAL OF REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES OF CERTAIN STATES. OUR ABILITY OR OUR WILLINGNESS TO MANAGE OUR CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE BY RAISING PRICES, MODIFYING UNDERWRITING TERMS OR REDUCING EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES MAY BE

LIMITED DUE TO CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, THE EVOLVING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CHANGES IN THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND/OR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WE ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO WRITE BUSINESS IN

CATASTROPHE-PRONE AREAS THAT WE MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE WRITE FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, SUCH AS IMPROVING OUR ACCESS TO OTHER UNDERWRITING OPPORTUNITIES.

THERE

ARE ALSO RISKS THAT IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY TO

ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPACTED

AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND;

EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE; BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN

ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

CATASTROPHE

LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY FISCAL QUARTER OR YEAR AND MAY MATERIALLY HARM OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, WHICH IN TURN COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CLAIMS-PAYING RATINGS AND COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES

OR FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE, RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RATINGS. A RATINGS

DOWNGRADE COULD HURT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD CAUSE US TO EXHAUST OUR AVAILABLE REINSURANCE LIMITS AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE. SUCH EVENTS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE CREDIT OF OUR REINSURERS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE, SEE

"ITEM IBUSINESSREINSURANCECATASTROPHE REINSURANCE." CATASTROPHIC EVENTS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE CREDIT OF THE ISSUERS OF SECURITIES, SUCH AS

STATES OR MUNICIPALITIES, IN WHOM WE HAVE INVESTED, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN

ADDITION TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, THE ACCUMULATION OF LOSSES FROM SMALLER WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER OR YEAR COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THOSE PERIODS.

GIVEN

THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN OUR OWN REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM,

PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY. ALTHOUGH THE

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 PROVIDES BENEFITS IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM, THOSE BENEFITS ARE SUBJECT TO A DEDUCTIBLE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS. UNDER THIS

LAW, ONCE OUR LOSSES EXCEED 20% OF OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PREMIUM FOR THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE US FOR 85% OF OUR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE

TO CERTAIN ACTS OF TERRORISM WHICH EXCEED THIS DEDUCTIBLE UP TO A TOTAL INDUSTRY PROGRAM CAP OF $100 BILLION. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THIS LAW IS RELATIVELY NEW AND ITS INTERPRETATION IS UNTESTED,

THERE MAY BE UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW IT WILL BE APPLIED TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THOSE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL EVENTS, OR MAN-MADE EVENTS SUCH AS A TERRORIST ATTACK (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING

NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS), COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY.

FINANCIAL DISRUPTION OR A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS

HAVE RECENTLY

EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION, RESULTING IN HEIGHTENED CREDIT RISK, REDUCED VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS AND DECREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. MOREOVER, MANY COMPANIES ARE EXPERIENCING REDUCED LIQUIDITY

AND UNCERTAINTY AS TO THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL. IN THE EVENT THAT THESE CONDITIONS PERSIST OR RESULT IN A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR

LIQUIDITY COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF RECENT FINANCIAL EVENTS, WE MAY FACE INCREASED REGULATION. MANY OF THE RISK FACTORS THAT FOLLOW IDENTIFY RISKS THAT

RESULT FROM, OR ARE EXACERBATED BY, FINANCIAL DISRUPTION OR A PROLONGED

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN. THESE INCLUDE RISKS DISCUSSED BELOW RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS, OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES, EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATION", PARTICULARLY THE "OUTLOOK" SECTION.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR MATERIAL LOSSES.

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OVERALL

PROFITABILITY.

FIXED

MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 94% OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS) AFFECT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS ON OUR FIXED MATURITY AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES

REDUCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW INVESTMENTS, THEREBY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME. CONVERSELY, RISING INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING FIXED MATURITY

INVESTMENTS.

WE

INVEST A PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, DIRECTLY

OWNED REAL ESTATE AND TRADING SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY IN THEIR INVESTMENT RETURNS THAN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN APPLICABLE

TAX LAWS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND THE REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME, AND/OR RESULT IN

REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AVAILABLE FROM SUCH INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY REALIZE REDUCED RETURNS ON THESE INVESTMENTS, WE MAY

INCUR LOSSES ON SALES OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES.

DURING

AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD BE SUBJECT TO HIGHER RISK. THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MAY DEFAULT

OR BECOME IMPAIRED

DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR PORTFOLIO, OR DUE TO A DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN INSURER THAT GUARANTEES AN

ISSUER'S PAYMENTS OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. SUCH DEFAULTS AND IMPAIRMENTS COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES.

OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASED VALUATION UNCERTAINTIES WHEN INVESTMENT MARKETS ARE ILLIQUID. THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE

ILLIQUID, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (I.E., THE CARRYING AMOUNT) OF THE PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AS REFLECTED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF PRICES AT WHICH ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS WOULD OCCUR.

OUR

FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED, IN SUBSTANTIAL PART, IN OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES, AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL

BOND PORTFOLIO). NOTWITHSTANDING THE RELATIVELY LOW HISTORICAL RATES OF DEFAULT ON MANY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS, DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, OUR MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO COULD BE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER

RISK OF DEFAULT OR IMPAIRMENT DUE TO DECLINING MUNICIPAL TAX BASES AND REVENUE. OUR PORTFOLIO HAS ALSO BENEFITED FROM TAX EXEMPTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE

GOVERNING DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS (SUCH AS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). FEDERAL AND/OR STATE TAX LEGISLATION COULD BE ENACTED IN CONNECTION WITH DEFICIT REDUCTION OR VARIOUS TYPES OF

FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM THAT WOULD LESSEN OR ELIMINATE SOME OR ALL OF THE TAX ADVANTAGES CURRENTLY BENEFITING US AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED NET INVESTMENT INCOME, AND WE COULD INCUR REALIZED INVESTMENT

LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY.

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT

ALL.

THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE ARE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF PRICE AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY, WHICH CAN AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS VOLUME AND PROFITABILITY. THE AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE CAPACITY CAN BE IMPACTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONS IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET, SUCH AS THE OCCURRENCE OF

SIGNIFICANT REINSURED EVENTS. IN PARTICULAR IN 2009, WE EXPECT THERE MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY SHORTAGE WITH REGARD TO CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COST AND

AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE TO US.

ALTHOUGH

THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO US TO THE EXTENT OF THE CEDED REINSURANCE, WE REMAIN LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. AS A RESULT, CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS

DO NOT ELIMINATE OUR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE FROM REINSURERS.

IN

THE PAST, CERTAIN REINSURERS HAVE CEASED WRITING BUSINESS AND ENTERED INTO RUNOFF. SOME OF OUR REINSURANCE CLAIMS MAY BE DISPUTED BY THE REINSURERS, AND WE MAY ULTIMATELY RECEIVE

PARTIAL OR NO PAYMENT. THIS IS A PARTICULAR RISK IN THE CASE OF CLAIMS THAT RELATE TO INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IN

ADDITION, IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS

CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY. THE ABILITY OF REINSURERS TO TRANSFER THEIR RISKS TO

OTHER, LESS CREDITWORTHY REINSURERS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE TO US.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE CERTAIN AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS COMPRISE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

SETTLE CERTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE WE DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE STRUCTURED

SETTLEMENT IS INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AS WE RETAIN THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, WE

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS.

MANY

REINSURANCE COMPANIES AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DETERIORATING FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING UNPRECEDENTED FINANCIAL MARKET

DISRUPTION. A NUMBER OF THESE COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED AND/OR HAVE BEEN PLACED ON NEGATIVE OUTLOOK BY VARIOUS RATING AGENCIES.

BECAUSE

OF THE RISKS SET FORTH ABOVE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM REINSURERS, AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN THE FUTURE AT

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES OR AT ALL, AND/OR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY FAIL TO MAKE REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS, AND THUS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION TO EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN SEVERAL OTHER AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK RELATING TO POLICYHOLDERS, INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND

BROKERS.

WE

ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN OUR SURETY INSURANCE OPERATIONS, WHERE WE GUARANTEE TO A THIRD PARTY THAT OUR CUSTOMER WILL SATISFY CERTAIN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (E.G., A

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT) OR CERTAIN FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. IF OUR CUSTOMER DEFAULTS, WE MAY SUFFER LOSSES AND BE UNABLE TO BE REIMBURSED BY OUR CUSTOMER.

IN

ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN WITH LARGE DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES. UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO

PAY THE

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLAIMANT

THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. WE ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE CONTRACTHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT AND, AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK TO THE POLICYHOLDER. MOREOVER,

CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE RETROSPECTIVELY RATED WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICIES (I.E., POLICIES IN WHICH PREMIUMS ARE ADJUSTED AFTER THE POLICY PERIOD BASED ON THE ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE OF

THE POLICYHOLDER DURING THE POLICY PERIOD). RETROSPECTIVELY RATED POLICIES EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL CREDIT RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADJUSTED PREMIUM IS GREATER THAN THE ORIGINAL PREMIUM.

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHEN POLICYHOLDERS PURCHASE INSURANCE POLICIES FROM US THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE PREMIUMS RELATING TO THOSE POLICIES ARE OFTEN

PAID TO THE AGENTS AND BROKERS FOR PAYMENT TO US. IN MOST JURISDICTIONS, THE PREMIUMS WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PAID TO US WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY US. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ASSUME A

DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS DUE FROM INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS.

TO

A LARGE DEGREE, THE CREDIT RISK WE FACE IS A FUNCTION OF THE ECONOMY; ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE A GREATER RISK IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE RISKS DISCUSSED ABOVE

THROUGH UNDERWRITING AND INVESTMENT GUIDELINES, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS, OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE, COLLATERAL OBTAINED MAY SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE LITTLE

OR NO VALUE. AS A RESULT, OUR EXPOSURE TO THE ABOVE CREDIT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF ACTUAL CLAIMS EXCEED OUR LOSS RESERVES, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF LOSS RESERVES ARE NECESSARY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT MANAGEMENT

ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND PROJECTION TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND

ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEWS OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN

CLAIMS SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY, EXPECTED INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES, WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE,

SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS,

SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES; ADVERSE CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS, INCLUDING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN MEDICAL COSTS AND AUTO AND HOME REPAIR COSTS; GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; LEGAL

TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES; AND VARYING JUDGMENTS AND VIEWPOINTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE

POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED

TO THE INSURER). THE ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES MAY ALSO BE MORE DIFFICULT DURING TIMES OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DUE TO UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR OF CLAIMANTS AND POLICYHOLDERS, INCLUDING

AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT REPORTING OF EXPOSURES AND/OR LOSSES, REDUCED MAINTENANCE OF INSURED PROPERTIES OR INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SMALL CLAIMS.

WE

CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR, ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. INFORMED JUDGMENT IS

APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. DIFFERENT EXPERTS MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN

FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOCUS.

HENCE, SUCH EXPERTS MAY AT TIMES PRODUCE ESTIMATES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. THIS RISK MAY BE EXACERBATED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACQUISITION. EXPERTS PROVIDING INPUT TO THE VARIOUS

ESTIMATES AND UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE ACTUARIES, UNDERWRITERS, CLAIM PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL

VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES.

WE

ATTEMPT TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME LOSS RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES, THE

FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES WILL LIKELY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RELATED LOSS RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES

IN THE FUTURE MAY YIELD A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNT THAN IS CURRENTLY RESERVED.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM ONE INSURED EVENT, OR AN ACCUMULATION OF INSURED EVENTS, MAY EXCEED THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN

ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR

A DISCUSSION OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES BY PRODUCT LINE, INCLUDING EXAMPLES OF COMMON FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT REQUIRED RESERVES, SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RESERVES."

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BECAUSE OF OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS

THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED

TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN ASBESTOS CLAIMS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE CONTINUE

TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM OUR POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY), INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST OUR POLICYHOLDERS BY INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT

APPEAR TO BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE. FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS AND THE FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON PREVIOUSLY

PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. THE FOCUS ON THESE DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IN ADDITION TO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES BY INITIALLY DELAYING THE REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY

ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING US. BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS HAVE ALSO CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT WHO

REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS

IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN INACTIVE DOCKET. THIS TREND OF PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING

CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON DEFENDANTS PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED PERIPHERAL, CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED. IN ADDITION,

OUR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE EXPERIENCE IS IMPACTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH THE EXHAUSTION

OF POLICY LIMITS OR INSOLVENCY.

WE

CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR A PORTION

OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED AS A

SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES.

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO

THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDER'S FAVOR AND OUR OTHER DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, OUR COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND

BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY

INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDER. ACCORDINGLY, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

MANY

COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO US BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN ORIGINALLY

ANTICIPATED. THERE ALSO MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE A COURT MAY NOT APPROVE A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FOR US. AS IN THE PAST,

WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

IN

ADDITION TO CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING US, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO THE

HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. WE ANTICIPATE THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING

US, IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF

LIABILITY.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE

ARISING OUT OF THEIR

ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO

RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN

REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

WE

HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. WE BELIEVE THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS HAVE INTERPRETED THE

INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY US PRIOR TO THE

MID-1980S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT BY

THE CLAIMANT FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND WE DO NOT TRACK THE MONETARY AMOUNTS BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS CONTINUE,

AND IT IS DIFFICULT

TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR THESE CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE

CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS

PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES WE HAVE

ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF SOME DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF

THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST US AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. IT IS ALSO NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT

DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION, INCLUDING LEGISLATION RELATED TO

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASBESTOS

REFORM. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LARGE COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING

SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE

COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE.

WHILE

THE ONGOING EVALUATION OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING

THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS

AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS." ALSO SEE

"ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS."

WE ARE EXPOSED TO, AND MAY FACE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING, MASS TORT CLAIMS SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR

SUBSTANCES.

IN ADDITION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO OTHER TYPES OF MASS TORT CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO EXPOSURE TO

POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PRODUCTS OR SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING LEAD PAINT, SILICA AND WELDING ROD FUMES. ESTABLISHING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR MASS TORT CLAIMS IS SUBJECT TO

UNCERTAINTIES BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, DISPUTES CONCERNING MEDICAL CAUSATION WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DISEASES, GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION OF THE LAWSUITS

ASSERTING THE CLAIMS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE RISE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS WITHOUT UNDERLYING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN DISEASE RATES. MOREOVER, EVOLVING

JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS TORT THEORIES AND DEFENSES, INCLUDING APPLICATION OF

VARIOUS THEORIES OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THESE CLAIMS, IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE OUR ULTIMATE LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, OUR ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE, AND SUCH CHANGE COULD BE MATERIAL. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE EFFECTS OF EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

AS INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND LEGAL, JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND

OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, UNEXPECTED AND UNINTENDED ISSUES RELATED TO CLAIM AND COVERAGE MAY EMERGE. THESE ISSUES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY EITHER EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OUR

UNDERWRITING INTENT OR BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF CLAIMS. EXAMPLES OF EMERGING CLAIMS AND COVERAGE ISSUES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.



JUDICIAL EXPANSION OF POLICY COVERAGE AND THE IMPACT OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY;



PLAINTIFFS TARGETING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS, INCLUDING US, IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATING TO

CLAIMS-HANDLING AND OTHER PRACTICES;



CLAIMS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS, WHICH OFTEN PRESENT COMPLEX COVERAGE AND DAMAGE VALUATION QUESTIONS;



CLAIMS UNDER DIRECTORS' & OFFICERS' INSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO: LOSSES FROM INVOLVEMENT IN FINANCIAL MARKET

ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MORTGAGE OR FINANCIAL PRODUCT ORIGINATION, DISTRIBUTION OR STRUCTURING; FRAUD, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES; POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING IRREGULARITIES; AND

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ISSUES;



THE ASSERTION OF "PUBLIC NUISANCE" THEORIES OF LIABILITY, PURSUANT TO WHICH PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO RECOVER MONIES SPENT TO

ADMINISTER PUBLIC HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS AND/OR TO ABATE HAZARDS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY; AND

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS



MEDICAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT LINK HEALTH ISSUES TO PARTICULAR CAUSES, RESULTING IN LIABILITY CLAIMS.

IN

SOME INSTANCES, THESE EMERGING ISSUES MAY NOT BECOME APPARENT FOR SOME TIME AFTER WE HAVE ISSUED THE AFFECTED INSURANCE POLICIES. AS A RESULT, THE FULL EXTENT OF LIABILITY UNDER OUR

INSURANCE POLICIES MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THE POLICIES ARE ISSUED.

IN

ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL PASSAGE OF NEW LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO EXPAND THE RIGHT TO SUE, TO REMOVE LIMITATIONS ON RECOVERY, TO EXTEND THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OR OTHERWISE TO REPEAL

OR WEAKEN TORT REFORMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN PARTICULAR, RECENT SHIFTS IN THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE COULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE PASSING OF SUCH LEGISLATION IN A

NUMBER OF STATES.

THE

EFFECTS OF THESE AND OTHER UNFORESEEN EMERGING CLAIM AND COVERAGE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO PREDICT AND COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE INTENSE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES AND OUR PROFITABILITY.

THE

PROPERTY AND

CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL REMAIN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE COMPETE WITH BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INSURERS, A NUMBER OF

WHICH ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. COMPETITORS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES MAY OFFER PRODUCTS AT PRICES AND ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ECONOMIC STANDARDS IN

AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THEIR BUSINESS. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ALSO BE IMPACTED BY CURRENT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS AVAILABLE

TO US, AS WELL AS TO OUR COMPETITORS. ALSO, COMPETITORS THAT RECEIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE ADVANTAGES THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS. SEE

"ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONOUTLOOK."

OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO OUR.



ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS, TO OBTAIN NEW BUSINESS AND TO PROFITABLY PRICE OUR BUSINESS;



AGENT, BROKER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS;



SPEED OF CLAIMS PAYMENT;



PREMIUMS CHARGED, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED (INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DESIGN CUSTOMIZED

PROGRAMS);



PERCEIVED OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CORRESPONDING RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES;



REPUTATION, EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES;



GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF BUSINESS;



LOCAL PRESENCE; AND



ABILITY TO KEEP PACE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

WE

MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN CONTINUING TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON ANY OF THESE BASES IN THE FUTURE. IF COMPETITION LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING BUSINESS OR WRITE NEW BUSINESS AT

ADEQUATE RATES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE "COMPETITION" SECTIONS OF THE DISCUSSION ON BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN "ITEM 1BUSINESS."

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND WE ARE THE SUBJECT OF A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS BY STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS

OR THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

AS PART OF INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS, WE HAVE

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECEIVED

SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS, THE U.S.

ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). THE AREAS OF PENDING INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO US INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS AND

OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH "NON-TRADITIONAL" INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS. WE MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION, SEE "ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS".

IT

WOULD BE PREMATURE TO REACH ANY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS OR THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. POTENTIAL OUTCOMES COULD INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT

PROCEEDINGS OR SETTLEMENTS RESULTING IN FINES, PENALTIES AND/OR CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THESE INVESTIGATIONS MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL WHICH COULD, IN TURN, ALSO MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED AND CHANGES IN REGULATION MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

WE ARE EXTENSIVELY

REGULATED AND

SUPERVISED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, INCLUDING LICENSING AND SUPERVISION BY GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AGENCIES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS.

THIS

REGULATORY SYSTEM IS GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS, AND NOT NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF INSURERS, THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INVESTORS. FOR

EXAMPLE, TO PROTECT POLICYHOLDERS WHOSE INSURANCE COMPANY BECOMES FINANCIALLY INSOLVENT, GUARANTY FUNDS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ALL FIFTY STATES TO PAY THE COVERED CLAIMS OF POLICYHOLDERS IN THE

EVENT OF AN INSOLVENCY OF AN INSURER. THE FUNDING OF GUARANTY FUNDS IS PROVIDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST REMAINING INSURERS IN THE MARKETPLACE. AS A RESULT, THE INSOLVENCY OF ONE OR MORE

INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS LEVIED AGAINST US.

THIS

REGULATORY SYSTEM ALSO ADDRESSES AUTHORIZATION FOR LINES OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS, LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, UNDERWRITING

LIMITATIONS, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS, CHANGES IN CONTROL, PREMIUM RATES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF AN INSURER'S BUSINESS.

IN

RECENT YEARS, THE STATE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS COME UNDER INCREASED FEDERAL SCRUTINY, AND SOME STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED OR ENACTED LAWS THAT MAY ALTER OR

INCREASE STATE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES. FURTHER, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS CONTINUALLY

REEXAMINE EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON MODIFICATIONS TO HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING LAWS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN

ADDITION, CONGRESS AND SOME FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM TIME TO TIME INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT CONDITION OF INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO IMPOSE FEDERAL OR NATIONAL

REGULATION OR TO ALLOW AN OPTIONAL FEDERAL CHARTER, SIMILAR TO THE OPTION AVAILABLE TO MOST BANKS. IN THE FUTURE, ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REGULATION MAY BE ENACTED WHICH COULD IMPACT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE

CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE COSTS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE EFFECT ANY PROPOSED OR FUTURE LEGISLATION OR NAIC INITIATIVES MAY HAVE ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

ALTHOUGH

THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY DIRECTLY REGULATE THE INSURANCE BUSINESS, CHANGES IN FEDERAL LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES IN

SEVERAL AREAS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION (E.G., THE REPEAL OF THE MCCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT) AND FEDERAL TAXATION, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING

US. A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS BEING CONSIDERED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS, IF THEY BECAME LAW, WOULD GIVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AN INCREASED ROLE IN INSURANCE REGULATION, INCLUDING SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER

THE HOLDING COMPANY.

FURTHER,

IN A TIME OF FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY OR A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, REGULATORS MAY CHOOSE TO ADOPT MORE RESTRICTIVE INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, INSURANCE

REGULATORS MAY

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHOOSE

TO RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES OR REJECT RATE INCREASES DUE TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

INSURANCE

LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED OR AMENDED MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN CURRENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS AND MAY RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND/OR HIGHER COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND

THUS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIMIT OUR GROWTH.

A DOWNGRADE IN OUR CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INCREASE

OUR

BORROWING COSTS.

CLAIMS-PAYING AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO AN INSURER'S COMPETITIVE POSITION. RATING AGENCIES REVIEW

INSURERS' RATINGS PERIODICALLY, AND CHANGE THEIR RATINGS CRITERIA PERIODICALLY, AND THEREFORE OUR CURRENT RATINGS MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. A DOWNGRADE IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR RATINGS COULD

NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS VOLUMES BECAUSE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE REDUCED, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE MANY CUSTOMERS MAY REQUIRE THAT WE MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATINGS TO ENTER INTO OR

RENEW BUSINESS WITH US. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND WE MAY INCUR HIGHER BORROWING COSTS. IF SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, SUCH AS THOSE RESULTING FROM ONE OR

MORE MAJOR CATASTROPHES, OR SIGNIFICANT RESERVE ADDITIONS OR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS WERE TO CAUSE OUR CAPITAL POSITION TO DETERIORATE SIGNIFICANTLY, OR IF ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES

SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE (WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO AT A REASONABLE COST OR AT ALL) IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR RATINGS OR

LIMIT THE EXTENT OF A DOWNGRADE. A CONTINUED TREND OF MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE WEATHER-RELATED CATASTROPHES OR A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN MAY LEAD RATING AGENCIES TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THEIR

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR RATINGS, SEE, "ITEM 1BUSINESSRATINGS."

THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER

DIVIDENDS.

OUR HOLDING COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON OUTSTANDING

DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND CORPORATE EXPENSES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON THEIR STATUTORY SURPLUS,

EARNINGS AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY SOME STATES AS AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS

AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. IN A TIME OF PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, REGULATORS MAY CHOOSE TO FURTHER RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. THE ABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IS ALSO RESTRICTED BY REGULATIONS THAT SET

STANDARDS OF SOLVENCY THAT MUST BE MET AND MAINTAINED. THE INABILITY OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS

AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO PAY FUTURE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS.

DISRUPTIONS TO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

WE MARKET OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS

PRIMARILY

THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS. AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IS WRITTEN THROUGH LESS THAN A DOZEN SUCH INTERMEDIARIES. LOSS OF ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BUSINESS PROVIDED

THROUGH SUCH AGENTS AND BROKERS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE

RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKETING AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY INCREASINGLY RELY ON INTERNET APPLICATIONS AND TOLL-FREE NUMBERS FOR

DISTRIBUTION. IN SOME INSTANCES, OUR AGENTS AND BROKERS ARE REQUIRED TO ACCESS SEPARATE BUSINESS PLATFORMS TO EXECUTE THE SALE OF OUR PERSONAL INSURANCE OR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. SHOULD

INTERNET DISRUPTIONS OCCUR, OR FRUSTRATION

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WITH

OUR BUSINESS PLATFORMS OR DISTRIBUTION INITIATIVES DEVELOP AMONG OUR INDEPENDENT AGENTS AND BROKERS, THE RESULTING LOSS OF BUSINESS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS

VOLUME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LOSS OF OR SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING IN THE PRICING AND UNDERWRITING OF PERSONAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE

PROFITABILITY.

IN PERSONAL INSURANCE, WE USE CREDIT SCORING AS A FACTOR IN PRICING DECISIONS WHERE ALLOWED BY STATE LAW. SOME CONSUMER GROUPS AND REGULATORS HAVE

QUESTIONED WHETHER THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH LOW INCOMES, MINORITY GROUPS AND THE ELDERLY AND ARE CALLING FOR THE PROHIBITION OR RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF

CREDIT SCORING IN UNDERWRITING AND PRICING. IN AUGUST OF 2008, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MICHIGAN COURT OF APPEALS RULED TO ALLOW STATE REGULATORS TO PROHIBIT INSURERS FROM USING CUSTOMERS' CREDIT SCORES TO

DETERMINE HOME AND AUTO INSURANCE RATES. LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL THE USE OF CREDIT SCORING, IF ENACTED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF STATES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE

PROFITABILITY.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES PRIMARILY

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND IRELAND. WE HAVE ALSO

STARTED TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING IN EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS INDIA AND CHINA. WHILE OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES CURRENTLY CONSTITUTES A RELATIVELY SMALL

PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, IN CONDUCTING SUCH BUSINESS WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS PRICE CONTROLS,

CAPITAL CONTROLS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, SOME COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY

EMERGING ECONOMIES, HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LACK CLARITY AND, EVEN WITH LOCAL EXPERTISE AND EFFECTIVE CONTROLS, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS OF THE LOCAL LAWS.

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL LAWS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT ONLY ON OUR BUSINESS IN THAT MARKET BUT ALSO ON OUR REPUTATION GENERALLY.

WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR CONTROLS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH GUIDELINES, POLICIES AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS ARE NOT

EFFECTIVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE ON A DAILY BASIS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING, CLAIM PROCESSING AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX. THESE ACTIVITIES OFTEN ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNAL GUIDELINES AND POLICIES, AS WELL AS LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. IF OUR CONTROLS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, IT COULD LEAD TO FINANCIAL LOSS, UNANTICIPATED RISK

EXPOSURE (INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK) OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS AND PROFITABILITY DEPEND, IN PART, ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY.

WE DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS FOR CONDUCTING BUSINESS AND PROCESSING CLAIMS, AND THUS OUR BUSINESS SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON

MAINTAINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND ON CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ENHANCE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN A COST AND

RESOURCE EFFICIENT MANNER. SOME SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR EXPENSE RATIOS AS WE INVEST IN THE PROJECTS AND MAY COST MORE THAN WE EXPECT

TO COMPLETE. THEY ALSO MAY NOT DELIVER THE BENEFITS WE EXPECT ONCE THEY ARE COMPLETE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGE AND UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, OR IF THE COSTS OF DOING SO

ARE HIGHER THAN WE EXPECT, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE SERVICES TO NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES COULD BE

ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

IF WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY, DATA SECURITY AND/OR OUTSOURCING RELATIONSHIPS OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

WHILE TECHNOLOGY CAN STREAMLINE MANY BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE COST OF OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES PRESENT CERTAIN RISKS. OUR

BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR EMPLOYEES' ABILITY TO PERFORM, IN AN EFFICIENT AND

UNINTERRUPTED

FASHION, NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. A SHUT-DOWN OF, OR INABILITY TO, ACCESS ONE OR MORE OF OUR FACILITIES, A POWER OUTAGE OR A FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SUCH FUNCTIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS INTERFACE WITH AND DEPEND ON THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE SERVICE DENIALS IF DEMAND FOR SUCH SERVICE EXCEEDS CAPACITY OR A THIRD-PARTY SYSTEM FAILS OR

EXPERIENCES AN INTERRUPTION. IF SUSTAINED OR REPEATED, SUCH A BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, SYSTEM FAILURE OR SERVICE DENIAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERIORATION OF OUR ABILITY TO WRITE AND PROCESS NEW AND

RENEWAL BUSINESS, PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE, PAY CLAIMS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR PERFORM OTHER NECESSARY BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. COMPUTER VIRUSES, HACKERS AND OTHER EXTERNAL HAZARDS COULD EXPOSE OUR DATA

SYSTEMS TO SECURITY BREACHES. THESE INCREASED RISKS, AND EXPANDING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING DATA SECURITY, COULD EXPOSE US TO DATA LOSS, MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES AND SIGNIFICANT

INCREASES IN COMPLIANCE COSTS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE

OUTSOURCE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES AND MAY DO SO INCREASINGLY IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT OUR OUTSOURCING

STRATEGY, THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS DO NOT PERFORM AS ANTICIPATED OR WE EXPERIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH A TRANSITION, WE MAY NOT REALIZE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS OR COST EFFICIENCIES AND

MAY EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES, INCREASED COSTS AND A LOSS OF BUSINESS. OUR OUTSOURCING OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS PROCESS FUNCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES MAY EXPOSE US TO ENHANCED RISK

RELATED TO DATA SECURITY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MONETARY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE

IMPACTED BY CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, UNANTICIPATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR POLICIES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS

MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY RESULT IN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

FROM TIME TO

TIME WE MAY

INVESTIGATE AND PURSUE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES IF WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH OPPORTUNITY IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES AND THAT THE POTENTIAL REWARDS OF THE ACQUISITION EXCEED

THE RISKS. THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING AN ACQUIRED COMPANY OR BUSINESS CAN BE COMPLEX AND COSTLY, HOWEVER, AND MAY CREATE UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND EXPENDITURES. FOR EXAMPLE, ACQUISITIONS

MAY PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISKS, INCLUDING.



THE POTENTIAL DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESS;



THE INEFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS HANDLING AND ACTUARIAL PRACTICES;



THE INCREASE IN THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY OF RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, UNTIL STABLE TRENDS REESTABLISH

THEMSELVES WITHIN THE COMBINED ORGANIZATION, AS PAST TRENDS (THAT WERE A FUNCTION OF PAST PRODUCTS, PAST CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, PAST CLAIMS DEPARTMENTS AND PAST LEGAL AND OTHER EXPERTS) MAY NOT

REPEAT THEMSELVES;



THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO ACQUISITION INTEGRATION CHALLENGES;



THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES; AND



THE CULTURAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING EMPLOYEES.

THERE

IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE FUTURE WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED, AND THE INEFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF OUR BUSINESSES AND PROCESSES MAY RESULT IN

SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR DELAYS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. ALSO, THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS MAY NOT PERFORM AS PROJECTED, AND ANY COST SAVINGS AND OTHER SYNERGIES ANTICIPATED FROM THE

ACQUISITION MAY NOT MATERIALIZE.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

ON JULY 23, 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF

THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $1.63 BILLION ($1.07 BILLION AFTER-TAX). THE

COMPANY RECORDED THESE ADJUSTMENTS AS CHARGES IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004. THROUGH AN INFORMAL COMMENT PROCESS, THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION

FINANCE SUBSEQUENTLY ASKED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDED. SPECIFICALLY, THE STAFF ASKED FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANY'S ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN OF SPC'S INSURANCE

RESERVES AND RESERVES FOR REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND PREMIUMS DUE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AND HOW THOSE ADJUSTMENTS MAY RELATE TO SPC'S RESERVES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MERGER OF SPC AND TPC. AFTER

REVIEWING THE STAFF'S QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS

APPROPRIATE. IF, HOWEVER, THE STAFF DISAGREES, SOME OR ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS BEING CONSIDERED MAY NOT BE RECORDED AS CHARGES IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, THEREBY INCREASING NET

INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2004 AND INCREASING SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, IN EACH CASE BY THE APPROXIMATE AFTER-TAX

AMOUNT OF THE CHANGE. THE EFFECT ON TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTS OF DEFERRED TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007,

2006, 2005 AND 2004 WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL. INCREASES TO GOODWILL AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WOULD BE REFLECTED ON THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET AT APRIL 1, 2004, EITHER DUE TO PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING OR ADJUSTMENT OF SPC'S RESERVES PRIOR TO THE MERGER OF SPC AND TPC. ON MAY 3, 2006, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE SEC (THE DIVISION) ADVISING

THE COMPANY THAT IT IS CONDUCTING AN INQUIRY RELATING TO THE SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS AND THE APRIL 1, 2004 MERGER BETWEEN SPC AND TPC. THE COMPANY COOPERATED WITH THE DIVISION'S

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

THE COMPANY LEASES ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK, AS WELL AS 191 FIELD AND CLAIM OFFICES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY

5.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES UNDER LEASES OR SUBLEASES WITH THIRD PARTIES. THE COMPANY OWNS SIX BUILDINGS IN HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY OCCUPIES

APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE IN THESE BUILDINGS. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS OFFICE BUILDINGS LOCATED AT 385 WASHINGTON STREET AND 130 WEST SIXTH STREET,

ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA. THESE BUILDINGS ARE ADJACENT TO ONE ANOTHER AND CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GROSS FLOOR SPACE. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS OTHER REAL PROPERTY,

INCLUDING OFFICE BUILDINGS IN DENVER, COLORADO AND FALL RIVER, MASSACHUSETTS, AS WELL AS A DATA CENTER LOCATED IN NORCROSS, GEORGIA.

THE

COMPANY OWNS A BUILDING IN LONDON, ENGLAND, WHICH HOUSES A PORTION OF ITS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

THE

COMPANY, THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OWNS AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF INCOME-PRODUCING PROPERTIES AND REAL ESTATE FUNDS. INCLUDED IN THIS PORTFOLIO ARE FOUR OFFICE BUILDINGS IN WHICH

THE COMPANY HOLDS A 50% OWNERSHIP INTEREST LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK, WHICH COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31,

2008.

IN

THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY'S PROPERTIES ARE ADEQUATE AND SUITABLE FOR ITS BUSINESS AS PRESENTLY CONDUCTED AND ARE ADEQUATELY MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THIS SECTION DESCRIBES THE MAJOR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS, TO WHICH

THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS A PARTY OR TO WHICH ANY OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY IS SUBJECT.

ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED PROCEEDINGS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY RECEIVES CLAIMS FOR INSURANCE ARISING UNDER POLICIES ISSUED BY THE

COMPANY ASSERTING ALLEGED INJURIES AND DAMAGES FROM ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED EXPOSURES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LITIGATION DESCRIBED

BELOW. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED LITIGATION. THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE RELATED LITIGATION CONTINUE TO CHANGE. THE

COMPANY IS DEFENDING ITS ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES OF THESE DISPUTES ARE UNCERTAIN. IN THIS REGARD,

THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE, INCLUDING SETTLING LITIGATION UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE, SEE "PART IIITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION," "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES."

IN

OCTOBER 2001 AND APRIL 2002, TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS (

WISE V. TRAVELERS

AND

MENINGER V.

TRAVELERS

) WERE FILED AGAINST TPC AND OTHER INSURERS (NOT INCLUDING SPC) IN STATE COURT IN WEST VIRGINIA. THESE AND OTHER CASES SUBSEQUENTLY FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA WERE

CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE PROCEEDING IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE INSURER DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BY INAPPROPRIATELY

HANDLING AND SETTLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO REOPEN LARGE NUMBERS OF SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, DIRECTLY ON INSURERS.

SIMILAR LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND HAWAII STATE COURTS (THESE SUITS AND THE WEST VIRGINIA SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS).

IN

MARCH 2002, THE PLAINTIFFS IN CONSOLIDATED ASBESTOS ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE A MASS TORT PANEL OF JUDGES IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT AMENDED THEIR COMPLAINT TO INCLUDE TPC AS A

DEFENDANT, ALLEGING THAT TPC AND OTHER INSURERS BREACHED ALLEGED DUTIES TO CERTAIN USERS OF ASBESTOS PRODUCTS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF

AND RAISING SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS, PRIMARILY VIOLATIONS OF PURPORTED COMMON LAW DUTIES TO THIRD PARTIES, ARE ALSO PENDING IN TEXAS STATE COURT AGAINST TPC AND SPC, AND IN LOUISIANA STATE COURT AGAINST

TPC (THE CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THESE SUITS, TOGETHER WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA SUIT, ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS).

THE

FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT HAD PRESIDED OVER THE BANKRUPTCY OF TPC'S FORMER POLICYHOLDER JOHNS-MANVILLE CORPORATION ISSUED A TEMPORARY INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE PROSECUTION OF

THE STATUTORY ACTIONS (BUT NOT THE HAWAII ACTIONS), THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS AND AN ADDITIONAL SET OF CASES FILED IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS IN TEXAS AND OHIO, AND ENJOINING CERTAIN ATTORNEYS FROM FILING

ANY FURTHER LAWSUITS AGAINST TPC BASED ON SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE INJUNCTION, ADDITIONAL COMMON LAW CLAIMS WERE FILED AGAINST TPC.

IN

NOVEMBER 2003, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS. THIS SETTLEMENT INCLUDES A LUMP-SUM PAYMENT OF UP TO $412 MILLION BY TPC,

SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. IN MAY 2004, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT RESOLVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PENDING AND SIMILAR FUTURE COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC. THIS SETTLEMENT

REQUIRES A PAYMENT OF

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UP

TO $90 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. EACH OF THESE SETTLEMENTS IS CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A FINAL ORDER OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CLARIFYING

THAT ALL OF THESE CLAIMS, AND SIMILAR FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, ARE BARRED BY PRIOR ORDERS ENTERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT.

ON

AUGUST 17, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED AN ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS AND CLARIFYING ITS PRIOR ORDERS THAT ALL OF THE PENDING STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON LAW CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST TPC ARE BARRED. THE ORDER ALSO APPLIES TO SIMILAR DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

ON

MARCH 29, 2006, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SUBSTANTIALLY AFFIRMED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT'S ORDERS WHILE VACATING THAT PORTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT'S ORDERS THAT REQUIRED ALL FUTURE DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST TPC TO FIRST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT BEFORE PROCEEDING IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.

VARIOUS

PARTIES APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURT'S MARCH 29, 2006 RULING TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. ON FEBRUARY 15, 2008, THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED AN

OPINION VACATING ON JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS THE DISTRICT COURT'S APPROVAL OF AN ORDER ISSUED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT PROHIBITING THE PROSECUTION OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW

CLAIMS, AS WELL AS FUTURE SIMILAR DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION, AGAINST TPC. ON FEBRUARY 29, 2008, TPC AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTIES TO THE APPEALS FILED PETITIONS FOR REHEARING AND/OR REHEARING

EN BANC

,

REQUESTING REINSTATEMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S JUDGMENT, WHICH WERE DENIED. TPC AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTIES FILED PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF

CERTIORARI IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SEEKING REVIEW OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S DECISION, AND ON DECEMBER 12, 2008, THE PETITIONS WERE GRANTED. UNLESS THE SUPREME COURT REVERSES THE SECOND

CIRCUIT'S DECISION, AND THE BANKRUPTCY COURT'S ORDER IS REINSTATED AND BECOMES FINAL, THE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE VOIDED, AND TPC WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS (OTHER THAN CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES). IN THAT CASE, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO LITIGATE THE DIRECT ACTION CASES VIGOROUSLY.

SPC,

WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT RULINGS OR THE SETTLEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IS A PARTY TO PENDING DIRECT ACTION CASES IN TEXAS STATE COURT ASSERTING COMMON LAW CLAIMS.

ALL SUCH CASES THAT ARE STILL PENDING AND IN WHICH SPC HAS BEEN SERVED ARE CURRENTLY ON THE INACTIVE DOCKET IN TEXAS STATE COURT. IF ANY OF THOSE CASES BECOMES ACTIVE, SPC INTENDS TO LITIGATE THOSE

CASES VIGOROUSLY.

CURRENTLY,

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT LEGAL OUTCOMES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. ANY SUCH

DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS

IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A

RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN PROCEEDINGS ADDRESSING DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS

DUE UNDER THE COMPANY'S REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY BE INITIATED BY THE COMPANY OR THE REINSURERS AND MAY INVOLVE THE TERMS OF THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THE COVERAGE OF PARTICULAR

CLAIMS, EXCLUSIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS COUNTERCLAIMS FOR RESCISSION OF THE AGREEMENTS. ONE OF THESE DISPUTES IS THE ACTION DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

THE

COMPANY'S GULF OPERATION BROUGHT AN ACTION ON MAY 22, 2003 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK (

GULF INSURANCE COMPANY V.

TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL.

),

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AGAINST

TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY (TRANSATLANTIC), XL REINSURANCE AMERICA, INC. (XL), ODYSSEY AMERICA REINSURANCE CORPORATION (ODYSSEY), EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE COMPANY (EMPLOYERS) AND

GERLING GLOBAL REINSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA (GERLING), TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE UNDER REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND RELATED TO GULF'S FEBRUARY 2003 SETTLEMENT OF A COVERAGE DISPUTE

UNDER A VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE PROTECTION INSURANCE POLICY. THE REINSURERS ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING RESCISSION OF THE VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND UNSPECIFIED

DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT. GERLING COMMENCED A SEPARATE ACTION ASSERTING THE SAME CLAIMS, WHICH HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE ORIGINAL GULF ACTION FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES.

GULF

HAS ENTERED INTO FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYERS, XL, TRANSATLANTIC AND ODYSSEY WHICH RESOLVE ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN GULF AND THESE DEFENDANTS UNDER THE REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS AT ISSUE IN THE LITIGATION.

IN

NOVEMBER 2007, THE COURT ISSUED RULINGS DENYING GULF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST GERLING, THE SOLE REMAINING DEFENDANT, BUT GRANTING GERLING'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL

SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON CERTAIN CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED BY GULF AND GERLING. GULF HAS APPEALED THE COURT'S DECISION TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK APPELLATE DIVISION, FIRST DEPARTMENT, AND HAS

BEEN GRANTED A STAY OF TRIAL ON THE REMAINING CLAIMS PENDING THAT APPEAL. BRIEFING OF THE APPEAL WAS COMPLETED ON APRIL 11, 2008, AND ORAL ARGUMENT WAS HELD ON MAY 20, 2008. GULF DENIES

GERLING'S ALLEGATIONS, BELIEVES THAT IT HAS A STRONG LEGAL BASIS TO COLLECT THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THE ACTION.

BASED

ON THE COMPANY'S BELIEFS ABOUT ITS LEGAL POSITIONS IN ITS VARIOUS REINSURANCE RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ANY OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, AS PART OF INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS THAT COMMENCED IN OCTOBER 2004, THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION FROM A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS, THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

AND THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). THE AREAS OF PENDING INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS AND THE COMPANY'S INVOLVEMENT WITH

"NON-TRADITIONAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS." THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS.

THE

COMPANY COOPERATED WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, OUTSIDE COUNSEL, WITH THE OVERSIGHT OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CONDUCTED AN INTERNAL

REVIEW OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS PRACTICES. THIS REVIEW WAS COMMENCED AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF LITIGATION BROUGHT IN OCTOBER 2004 BY THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AGAINST A MAJOR

BROKER. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS REVIEW. WITH RESPECT TO THE IDENTIFIED FINITE PRODUCTS PURCHASED AND SOLD, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT NO ADJUSTMENT TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS

REQUIRED. ANY AUTHORITY WITH OPEN INQUIRIES OR INVESTIGATIONS COULD ASK THAT ADDITIONAL WORK BE PERFORMED OR REACH CONCLUSIONS DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPANY'S.

IN

2005, FOUR PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE BROUGHT AGAINST A NUMBER OF INSURANCE BROKERS AND INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, BY PLAINTIFFS WHO

ALLEGEDLY PURCHASED INSURANCE PRODUCTS THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE DEFENDANT BROKERS. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGED THAT VARIOUS INSURANCE BROKERS CONSPIRED WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH VARIOUS INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE PREMIUMS, ALLOCATE BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS AND RIG BIDS FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS OFFERED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. TO THE EXTENT

THEY WERE NOT ORIGINALLY FILED THERE, THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTIONS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY AND WERE CONSOLIDATED FOR PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS

WITH OTHER CLASS ACTIONS UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

. ON AUGUST 1, 2005, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING THE

FOUR NAMED PLAINTIFFS

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

THE ABOVE-REFERENCED CLASS ACTIONS, FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT NAMING VARIOUS BROKERS AND INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, ON BEHALF OF A

PUTATIVE NATIONWIDE CLASS OF POLICYHOLDERS. THE COMPLAINT INCLUDED CAUSES OF ACTION UNDER THE SHERMAN ACT, THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT (RICO), STATE COMMON LAW AND THE LAWS

OF THE VARIOUS STATES PROHIBITING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. THE COMPLAINT SOUGHT MONETARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND TREBLED DAMAGES, PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, RESTITUTION, INCLUDING

DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS, INTEREST AND COSTS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES. ALL DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM. AFTER GIVING PLAINTIFFS MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO

REPLEAD, THE COURT DISMISSED THE SHERMAN ACT CLAIMS ON AUGUST 31, 2007 AND THE RICO CLAIMS ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2007, BOTH WITH PREJUDICE, AND DECLINED TO EXERCISE SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION

OVER THE STATE LAW CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS ARE APPEALING THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISIONS TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN STATE AND

FEDERAL COURTS AGAINST THE COMPANY INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION,

AND FURTHER ACTIONS MAY BE

BROUGHT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY.

IN

ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS, NOT INVOLVING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, ARISING MOSTLY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS

OPERATIONS, EITHER AS A LIABILITY INSURER DEFENDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, OR AS AN INSURER DEFENDING CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST IT RELATING TO COVERAGE OR THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESS PRACTICES. WHILE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT,

NONE WOULD LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

THE

COMPANY PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT IT SOUGHT GUIDANCE FROM THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN

SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $1.63 BILLION. SEE "ITEM 1BUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS." AFTER DISCUSSION WITH THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATE FINANCE AND THE

COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE. ON MAY 3, 2006, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE

DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE SEC (THE DIVISION) ADVISING THE COMPANY THAT IT IS CONDUCTING AN INQUIRY RELATING TO THE SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS AND THE APRIL 1, 2004 MERGER OF SPC AND

COMPANY'S DISCUSSIONS OF NET INCOME AND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ARE PRESENTED ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS. DISCUSSIONS OF THE COMPONENTS

OF NET INCOME AND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME ARE PRESENTED ON A PRETAX BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. DISCUSSIONS OF EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE ARE PRESENTED ON A DILUTED BASIS.

OVERVIEW

NET INCOME OF $4.82 PER COMMON SHARE IN 2008 WAS 30% LOWER THAN THE $6.86 PER COMMON SHARE IN 2007. NET INCOME IN 2008 TOTALED

$2.92 BILLION, 36% LOWER THAN $4.60 BILLION IN 2007. THE LOWER RATE OF DECLINE IN PER SHARE INCOME COMPARED WITH THE RATE OF DECLINE IN ACTUAL INCOME REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE

COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES. THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE COST OF CATASTROPHES AND A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN NET INVESTMENT

INCOME. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE WERE NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES, A SMALL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE LOSSES THAT EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS, AN INCREASE IN NON-CATASTROPHE

RELATED WEATHER LOSSES, THE IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS ON PRICING, THE IMPACT OF LOSS COST TRENDS AND A DECLINE IN FEE INCOME. NET INCOME IN 2008 REFLECTED AN $89 MILLION TAX

BENEFIT RELATED TO THE SALE OF A SUBSIDIARY. IN 2007, NET INCOME INCLUDED A NET PRETAX BENEFIT OF $163 MILLION DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW FIXED, VALUE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR THE

MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S AGENTS WHICH RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN COMMISSION EXPENSE COMPARED TO WHAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN REPORTED, DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION. THESE

FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, WHICH TOTALED $1.54 BILLION IN 2008,

70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPARED

WITH $546 MILLION IN 2007. THE COST OF CATASTROPHES IN 2008, NET OF REINSURANCE AND INCLUDING HURRICANE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS OF $141 MILLION (DISCUSSED BELOW), TOTALED

$1.41 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $167 MILLION IN 2007. HURRICANES IKE AND GUSTAV, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER STORMS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, ACCOUNTED FOR THE COST OF CATASTROPHES IN

2008. NET INCOME IN 2007 ALSO INCLUDED A BENEFIT OF $86 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS PRIOR YEAR FEDERAL TAX MATTERS AND A PRETAX LOSS OF $39 MILLION RELATED

TO THE COMPANY'S REDEMPTION OF ITS 4.50% CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES.

HURRICANE-RELATED

ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE ASSESSMENTS FROM STATE-CREATED INSURANCE AND WINDSTORM INSURANCE ENTITIES SUCH AS CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION IN FLORIDA, LOUISIANA

CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION AND THE TEXAS WINDSTORM INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. ASSESSMENTS ARE LEVIED ON INSURERS WRITING BUSINESS IN THOSE STATES TO FUND THE OPERATING DEFICITS OF SUCH

ENTITIES DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT STORM ACTIVITY. HURRICANE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF "GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES" AS THE AMOUNTS PAID TO SUCH ENTITIES ARE NOT

INSURED LOSSES OF THE COMPANY.

NET

INCOME OF $6.86 PER COMMON SHARE IN 2007 WAS 16% HIGHER THAN THE $5.91 PER COMMON SHARE IN 2006. NET INCOME IN 2007 TOTALED $4.60 BILLION, 9% HIGHER THAN $4.21 BILLION

IN 2006. THE HIGHER RATE OF GROWTH IN PER SHARE INCOME COMPARED WITH THE RATE OF GROWTH IN ACTUAL INCOME IN 2007 OVER 2006 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES

SINCE ITS REPURCHASE PROGRAM BEGAN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME IN 2007 REFLECTED GROWTH IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME, A HIGHER LEVEL OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT, AN INCREASE IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS, FAVORABLE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR RESULTS AND INCREASED BUSINESS VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN EXPENSES AND A DECLINE IN FEE

INCOME. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT TOTALED $546 MILLION IN 2007, COMPARED WITH NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $394 MILLION IN 2006. EXPENSES IN 2007 INCLUDED A NET PRETAX BENEFIT OF

$163 MILLION DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED, VALUE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S AGENTS. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2007 TOTALED $167 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH $103 MILLION IN 2006. NET INCOME IN BOTH 2007 AND 2006 INCLUDED AFTER-TAX BENEFITS OF $86 MILLION DUE TO THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS PRIOR YEAR TAX

MATTERS. THE 2007 TOTAL ALSO INCLUDED NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OF $154 MILLION, COMPARED WITH NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OF $11 MILLION IN 2006.

REVENUES

EARNED PREMIUMS

EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2008 TOTALED $21.58 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $109 MILLION, OR LESS THAN 1%, OVER 2007. IN MARCH 2007,

THE COMPANY SOLD ITS MEXICAN SURETY SUBSIDIARY, AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES, S.A. DE C.V. (AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES), WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR $27 MILLION OF EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2007 PRIOR TO ITS

SALE. IN APRIL 2007, THE COMPANY SOLD MENDOTA INSURANCE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, MENDOTA), WHICH PRIMARILY OFFERED NONSTANDARD AUTOMOBILE COVERAGE AND ACCOUNTED FOR

$46 MILLION OF EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2007 PRIOR TO ITS SALE. ADJUSTING FOR THESE SALES IN 2007, CONSOLIDATED EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2008 INCREASED BY $182 MILLION, OR 1%, OVER 2007. IN THE

BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2008 DECLINED 1% FROM 2007 DESPITE CONTINUED STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION RATES, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS ON PRICING AND NEW

BUSINESS. IN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, EARNED PREMIUM GROWTH OF 2% IN 2008 (ADJUSTED FOR THE SALE OF AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES) WAS DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE

TERMS OF CERTAIN REINSURANCE TREATIES FOR BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, EARNED PREMIUM GROWTH OF 3% IN 2008 (ADJUSTED FOR THE SALE OF MENDOTA) REFLECTED

CONTINUED STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION RATES AND NEW BUSINESS VOLUME, COUPLED WITH CONTINUED RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES.

EARNED

PREMIUMS IN 2007 TOTALED $21.47 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $710 MILLION, OR 3%, OVER 2006. AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES AND MENDOTA ACCOUNTED FOR $78 MILLION AND

$176 MILLION OF EARNED PREMIUMS,

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESPECTIVELY,

IN 2006. ADJUSTING FOR THE SALES OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES IN BOTH YEARS, EARNED PREMIUMS IN 2007 GREW 4% OVER 2006. IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT, EARNED PREMIUM GROWTH OF 4% IN 2007

OVER 2006 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME OVER THE PRECEDING TWELVE

MONTHS. IN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, EARNED PREMIUM GROWTH OF 4% IN 2007 OVER 2006 (ADJUSTED FOR THE SALE OF AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES) WAS DRIVEN BY THE

FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES OF EXCHANGE, GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME AND A BENEFIT FROM ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR YEAR PREMIUM ESTIMATES FOR THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S. IN THE

PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, EARNED PREMIUM GROWTH OF 6% IN 2007 OVER 2006 (ADJUSTED FOR THE SALE OF MENDOTA) REFLECTED CONTINUED STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION RATES, CONTINUED RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES AND

GROWTH FROM NEW BUSINESS VOLUMES OVER THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS.

NET

INVESTMENT INCOME OF $2.79 BILLION IN 2008 DECLINED $969 MILLION, OR 26%, FROM 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER RETURNS FROM NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS,

WHICH WERE NEGATIVE IN 2008, COMPARED WITH STRONG POSITIVE RETURNS IN 2007. NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS

THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND TYPICALLY REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION ON A LAG. THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND FUNDS PRODUCED NEGATIVE NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF

$327 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED WITH NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF $473 MILLION IN 2007. THE VALUE OF MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS WAS UPDATED THROUGH YEAR-END BASED UPON INFORMATION

MADE AVAILABLE BY CERTAIN OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGERS. THIS UPDATE ACCOUNTED FOR $87 MILLION OF THE NON-FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO'S INVESTMENT LOSS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DECLINE IN NET

INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THESE INVESTMENTS IN 2008 REFLECTED MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOWER LEVEL OF TRANSACTIONS AND LOWER MARKET VALUES COMPARED TO THOSE AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. NET

INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO IN 2008 ALSO DECLINED FROM 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES. THE AMORTIZED COST OF

THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 TOTALED $61.57 BILLION, $2.58 BILLION LOWER THAN AT THE SAME DATE IN 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE USE OF $2.12 BILLION

OF FUNDS FOR THE COMPANY'S COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES DURING 2008, THE PAYMENT OF $715 MILLION OF DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, THE TRANSFER OF $662 MILLION OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AS

PART OF THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA, AND $450 MILLION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION PLAN, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE AVERAGE PRETAX

INVESTMENT YIELD OF 3.8% IN 2008 DECLINED FROM 5.1% IN 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE NEGATIVE INVESTMENT INCOME FROM NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS IN 2008.

NET

INVESTMENT INCOME TOTALED $3.76 BILLION IN 2007, AN INCREASE OF $244 MILLION, OR 7%, OVER 2006 NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF $3.52 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN 2007 WAS

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO RESULTING FROM STRONG CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND HIGHER YIELDS ON LONG-TERM TAXABLE FIXED

MATURITY SECURITIES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO INVESTMENT INCOME GROWTH IN 2007 WERE STRONG LEVELS OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE COMPANY'S

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REAL

ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 TOTALED $64.15 BILLION, $1.91 BILLION HIGHER THAN YEAR-END 2006. THE

AVERAGE PRETAX INVESTMENT YIELD WAS 5.1% IN 2007, COMPARED WITH 4.9% IN 2006. THE INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED STRONG RETURNS GENERATED BY THE REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS AND HIGHER YIELDS ON TAXABLE

INVESTMENTS PURCHASED IN 2007.

EXCEPT

AS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR CERTAIN LEGAL ENTITIES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES ITS INVESTED ASSETS AND THE RELATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME TO ITS REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. PRETAX NET

INVESTMENT INCOME IS ALLOCATED BASED UPON AN INVESTABLE FUNDS CONCEPT, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT LIABILITIES (NET OF NON-INVESTED ASSETS) AND APPROPRIATE CAPITAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EACH

SEGMENT. FOR INVESTABLE FUNDS, A BENCHMARK INVESTMENT YIELD IS DEVELOPED THAT REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE LOSS RESERVES' FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME THE

LOSSES WERE INCURRED AND A+ RATED CORPORATE DEBT INSTRUMENT YIELDS. FOR CAPITAL, A BENCHMARK INVESTMENT YIELD IS DEVELOPED THAT REFLECTS THE AVERAGE YIELD ON THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE

BENCHMARK INVESTMENT YIELDS ARE APPLIED TO EACH SEGMENT'S INVESTABLE FUNDS AND CAPITAL, RESPECTIVELY, TO PRODUCE A TOTAL NOTIONAL INVESTMENT INCOME BY SEGMENT. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL NET INVESTMENT

INCOME IS ALLOCATED TO EACH SEGMENT IN PROPORTION TO THE RESPECTIVE SEGMENT'S NOTIONAL INVESTMENT INCOME TO TOTAL NOTIONAL INVESTMENT INCOME. THERE ARE CERTAIN LEGAL ENTITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY THAT

ARE DEDICATED TO SPECIFIC REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE INVESTED ASSETS AND RELATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THESE LEGAL ENTITIES ARE REPORTED IN THE APPLICABLE BUSINESS SEGMENT AND ARE NOT

ALLOCATED.

FEE INCOME

THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS MARKET IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE COMPANY'S FEE-BASED BUSINESS.

THE DECLINES IN FEE INCOME IN 2008 AND 2007 COMPARED WITH THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEARS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS.

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES)

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES OF $415 MILLION IN 2008 WERE DRIVEN BY $420 MILLION OF INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS. THE 2008

IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDED $186 MILLION RELATED TO THE DETERIORATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF VARIOUS ISSUERS (INCLUDING $70 MILLION RELATED TO SECURITIES ISSUED BY LEHMAN BROTHERS

HOLDINGS INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES), $113 MILLION RELATED TO EXTERNALLY MANAGED SECURITIES WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASSERT AN INTENTION TO HOLD

UNTIL RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE, $64 MILLION RELATED TO STRUCTURED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS AND $57 MILLION RELATED TO SECURITIES THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED FOR POTENTIAL SALES PRIOR TO A

RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES IN 2008 ALSO INCLUDED $77 MILLION RELATED TO CONVERTIBLE BONDS WHEREIN THE EMBEDDED OPTION PRICE IS MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH REALIZED

GAINS OR LOSSES AND $53 MILLION OF LOSSES RELATED TO U.S. TREASURY FUTURES CONTRACTS (WHICH REQUIRE A DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET SETTLEMENT AND ARE USED TO SHORTEN THE

DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO). PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES IN 2008 WERE NET REALIZED GAINS OF $50 MILLION RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE GAINS, $39 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF SUBSIDIARIES AND $17 MILLION OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS FROM THE SALE OF VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.

NET

REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OF $154 MILLION IN 2007 INCLUDED $91 MILLION OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (NET OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $16 MILLION) GENERATED BY

THE VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO (INCLUDING AN $81 MILLION NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAIN FROM THE BUNDLED SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT HOLDINGS),

$63 MILLION OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS FROM THE SALE OF A PRIVATELY HELD SECURITY, $21 MILLION OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S HOLDINGS OF STOCK PURCHASE

WARRANTS OF PLATINUM UNDERWRITERS HOLDINGS, LTD., A PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY, AND $5 MILLION OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (NET OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $37 MILLION)

FROM THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO. THESE GAINS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSS OF $24 MILLION RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF A SUBSIDIARY. NET REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS IN 2006 TOTALED $11 MILLION.

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS DECREASED BY 1% FROM 2007, DESPITE STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION RATES. PREMIUM GROWTH IN INDUSTRY-FOCUSED UNDERWRITING, SELECT ACCOUNTS AND COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS IN 2008, WHICH WAS

GENERALLY DRIVEN BY STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION RATES AND NEW BUSINESS VOLUME, WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY PREMIUM DECLINES IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, TARGET RISK UNDERWRITING AND SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION WHICH

PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM DECLINES IN RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT ADJUSTED FOR THE SALE OF AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES

INCREASED BY 1% OVER 2007, LARGELY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE TERMS OF CERTAIN REINSURANCE TREATIES THAT RESULTED IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF BUSINESS RETAINED IN THE BOND & FINANCIAL PRODUCTS GROUP. IN

PREMIUM GROWTH OF 2% WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS, SELECT ACCOUNTS AND INDUSTRY-FOCUSED UNDERWRITING MARKETS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION RATES COUPLED WITH HIGHER NEW

BUSINESS VOLUME.

INSURANCE, NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH OF 4% (ADJUSTED FOR THE SALE OF AFIANZADORA INSURGENTES) REFLECTED THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES OF EXCHANGE AND STRONG BUSINESS VOLUME IN

CONSTRUCTION SURETY, IN CANADA AND AT LLOYD'S. ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR YEAR PREMIUM ESTIMATES FOR THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN NET PREMIUM VOLUME IN 2007. NET

WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH OF 4% IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT IN 2007 (ADJUSTED FOR THE SALE OF MENDOTA) WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED STRONG RETENTION RATES AND RENEWAL PRICE INCREASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY A DECLINE IN NEW BUSINESS VOLUME, PARTICULARLY FOR COASTAL COVERAGES.

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TOTALED $12.99 BILLION IN 2008, $596 MILLION, OR 5%, HIGHER THAN THE 2007 TOTAL OF

$12.40 BILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE COST OF CATASTROPHES, AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE LOSSES THAT EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS, AN INCREASE IN

NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED WEATHER LOSSES IN PERSONAL INSURANCE AND THE IMPACT OF LOSS COST TRENDS. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT. THE COST OF CATASTROPHES INCLUDED IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2008 TOTALED $1.26 BILLION, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HURRICANES IKE AND GUSTAV, AS WELL AS WIND, RAIN

AND HAIL STORMS IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THE COST OF CATASTROPHES IN 2007 TOTALED $167 MILLION, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA AND SEVERAL

WIND, RAIN AND HAIL STORMS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2008 TOTALED $1.54 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $546 MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR

YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2007.

THE

COMPANY'S THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS EACH EXPERIENCED NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2008. THE MAJORITY OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OCCURRED IN THE

BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT AND WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS RESULTS PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL, COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

PRODUCT LINES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESERVES AND $70 MILLION AND $85 MILLION INCREASES IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, RESPECTIVELY (WHICH ARE

DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS HEREIN). THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT

EXPERIENCED FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL GROUP, PARTICULARLY IN THE PUBLIC AND PRODUCTS LIABILITY (GENERAL LIABILITY), PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY (PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY) AND

PROPERTY LINES OF BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE GENERAL LIABILITY LINE OF BUSINESS IN CANADA, AND THE AVIATION AND PROPERTY LINES OF BUSINESS AT LLOYD'S. IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT,

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE LOSS EXPERIENCE RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA AS WELL AS BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE IN CERTAIN LINES OF

BUSINESS WITHIN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER PRODUCT LINE.

EACH

OF THE COMPANY'S THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ALSO EXPERIENCED NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2007. IN BUSINESS INSURANCE, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT

WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS IN THE COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL, GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE AND PROPERTY PRODUCT LINES. NET TOTAL

PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2007 IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT INCLUDED A $185 MILLION INCREASE TO ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES. IN THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL

INSURANCE SEGMENT, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2007 PRIMARILY REFLECTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN INTERNATIONAL PROPERTY, EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY, PROFESSIONAL

INDEMNITY AND MOTOR LINES OF BUSINESS FOR RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS. IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2007 OCCURRED IN BOTH THE AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS

AND OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS.

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FACTORS

CONTRIBUTING TO NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN EACH SEGMENT IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006 ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS THAT FOLLOW.

CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES OF $12.40 BILLION IN 2007 WERE $153 MILLION, OR 1%, HIGHER THAN THE 2006 TOTAL OF $12.24 BILLION. THE 2007 TOTAL INCLUDED

$546 MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND $167 MILLION OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES, WHEREAS THE 2006 TOTAL INCLUDED $394 MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND $103 MILLION OF CATASTROPHE LOSSES.

NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT, PRIMARILY REFLECTING BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE AUTO BODILY

INJURY AND NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS, AND A REDUCTION IN LOSS ESTIMATES FOR THE 2005 HURRICANES. THE BUSINESS INSURANCE SEGMENT ALSO EXPERIENCED NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS IN 2006, PRIMARILY IN THE COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL, GENERAL LIABILITY, PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LINES OF BUSINESS. THE FAVORABLE

DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $155 MILLION AND $120 MILLION INCREASES TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE

"ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS HEREIN. THERE WAS ALSO UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN RUNOFF ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS IN 2006.

IN

2006, CATASTROPHE LOSSES TOTALED $103 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH WAS INCURRED IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT AND RESULTED FROM SEVERAL WIND, RAIN, HAIL AND SNOW STORMS IN THE

UNITED STATES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS TOTALED $3.88 BILLION IN 2008, $174 MILLION, OR 5%, HIGHER THAN THE

COMPARABLE 2007 TOTAL OF $3.71 BILLION. THE GROWTH IN AMORTIZATION COSTS IN 2008 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE HIGHER LEVEL OF AMORTIZED COMMISSION EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY'S IMPLEMENTATION

OF A NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM IN 2007, DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.

THE

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS TOTALED $3.71 BILLION IN 2007, $367 MILLION, OR 11%, HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE TOTAL OF $3.34 BILLION IN 2006,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING A $213 MILLION INCREASE FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S AGENTS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE REMAINING INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME IN 2007.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TOTALED $3.52 BILLION IN 2008, AN INCREASE OF $166 MILLION, OR 5%, OVER THE

COMPARABLE 2007 TOTAL OF $3.35 BILLION. THIS INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF $141 MILLION OF HURRICANE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS.

GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TOTALED $3.35 BILLION IN 2007, A DECREASE OF $106 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE COMPARABLE 2006 TOTAL OF $3.46 BILLION. THE DECLINE

PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, WHICH WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED TO

INCREASED BUSINESS VOLUME AND CONTINUED EXPENDITURES TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY DISCONTINUED THE USE OF CONTINGENT COMMISSIONS AND IMPLEMENTED A NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR ALL OF ITS PERSONAL INSURANCE

BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERED THE MAJORITY OF ITS AGENTS CONDUCTING COMMERCIAL INSURANCE BUSINESS THE OPTION TO SWITCH TO THIS NEW PROGRAM. THE COMPANY'S TOTAL PAYOUT RATE FOR ALL AGENT

COMPENSATION FOR 2007 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS FOR 2006; HOWEVER, THE CHANGE TO THE NEW PROGRAM CREATED A DIFFERENCE IN THE TIMING OF COMMISSION EXPENSE RECOGNITION. THE COST OF THE NEW PROGRAM

IS REQUIRED TO BE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE RELATED POLICY PERIOD (GENERALLY SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS), WHEREAS THE COST OF THE

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTINGENT

COMMISSION PROGRAM WAS NOT SUBJECT TO DEFERRED ACQUISITION COST ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND, THEREFORE, WAS EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THAT TIMING DIFFERENCE RESULTED IN A BENEFIT TO INCOME DURING

THE 2007 TRANSITION YEAR. THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE IN 2007 WAS TO LOWER REPORTED EXPENSES BY $376 MILLION IN THE "GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES" INCOME STATEMENT LINE, AND INCREASE

REPORTED EXPENSES BY $213 MILLION IN THE "AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS" INCOME STATEMENT LINE, COMPARED TO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED UNDER THE PRIOR CONTINGENT COMMISSION

PROGRAM.

INTEREST EXPENSE

INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2008 TOTALED $370 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $24 MILLION, OR 7%, OVER THE 2007 TOTAL OF

$346 MILLION. THE INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED A HIGHER AVERAGE LEVEL OF DEBT OUTSTANDING AT A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE DURING 2008. INTEREST EXPENSE OF $346 MILLION IN 2007

WAS $22 MILLION HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2006 TOTAL OF $324 MILLION. THE INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S ISSUANCE OF DEBT IN 2007, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN MORE

DETAIL IN THE "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" SECTION HEREIN. PROCEEDS FROM A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF DEBT ISSUANCES IN 2007 WERE USED TO FUND THE REDEMPTION AND MATURITY OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S

INDEBTEDNESS.

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 21.3%, 26.0% AND 26.5% IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECLINES IN 2008 AND 2007

PRIMARILY REFLECTED A HIGHER PROPORTION OF TAX-EXEMPT INVESTMENT INCOME.

GAAP COMBINED RATIOS

THE CONSOLIDATED LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 59.4% FOR 2008 WAS 2.8 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT

EXPENSE RATIO OF 56.6% IN 2007. THE COST OF CATASTROPHES ACCOUNTED FOR 5.8 POINTS OF THE 2008 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO, WHEREAS THE 2007 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO INCLUDED A

0.7 POINT IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHE LOSSES. THE 2008 AND 2007 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS INCLUDED 7.1 POINT AND 2.5 POINT BENEFITS, RESPECTIVELY, FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT. THE 2008 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO ADJUSTED FOR THE COST OF CATASTROPHES AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS 2.3 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE RESPECTIVE 2007 RATIO ON THE SAME

BASIS, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS ON PRICING, A SMALL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE LOSSES, NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER RELATED LOSSES AND LOSS COST TRENDS.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 32.5% IN 2008 WAS 1.7 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2007 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 30.8%. THE 2008 EXPENSE RATIO INCLUDED A 0.7 POINT IMPACT OF THE

HURRICANE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS, WHEREAS THE 2007 RATIO INCLUDED A 0.8 POINT BENEFIT FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM DESCRIBED ABOVE. ADJUSTING FOR THESE FACTORS IN

BOTH YEARS, THE ADJUSTED 2008 EXPENSE RATIO WAS 0.2 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE ADJUSTED EXPENSE RATIO IN 2007, REFLECTING

CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS SALARY INCREASES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

THE

CONSOLIDATED LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 56.6% IN 2007 WAS 0.9 POINTS LOWER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2006 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 57.5%. THE 2007 AND 2006

LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS INCLUDED BENEFITS OF 2.5 POINTS AND 1.9 POINTS, RESPECTIVELY, FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. CATASTROPHE LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR 0.7 POINTS AND

0.5 POINTS OF THE 2007 AND 2006 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS. EXCLUDING CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, THE 2007 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IMPROVED BY

0.5 POINTS COMPARED WITH THE COMPARABLE 2006 RATIO, REFLECTING CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR RESULTS IN SEVERAL LINES OF BUSINESS. THE UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 30.8% IN 2007 WAS

0.2 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2006 UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 30.6%. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM DESCRIBED ABOVE PROVIDED A BENEFIT OF 0.8 POINTS TO THE

EXPENSE RATIOS IN 2007, WHICH WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE INCREASES IN EXPENSES DISCUSSED ABOVE.

OVERVIEW

OPERATING INCOME OF $2.34 BILLION IN 2008 WAS $677 MILLION, OR 22%, LOWER THAN OPERATING INCOME OF $3.02 BILLION

IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF CATASTROPHES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THIS REDUCTION WERE A DECLINE IN FEE INCOME, THE IMPACT OF

COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS ON PRICING, THE IMPACT OF LOSS COST TRENDS, AND A SMALL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE PROPERTY LOSSES. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT IN 2008 PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE FACTORS. THE COST OF CATASTROPHES IN 2008 TOTALED $706 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $4 MILLION IN 2007. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT

TOTALED $1.12 BILLION AND $301 MILLION IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING INCOME IN 2008 INCLUDED AN $89 MILLION TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA, WHICH

COMPRISED THE COMPANY'S UNITED KINGDOM-BASED RUNOFF DIRECT INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES. OPERATING INCOME IN 2007 BENEFITED BY $81 MILLION FROM THE COMPANY'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW

FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM (DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW" SECTION HEREIN) AND THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN TAX MATTERS.

OPERATING

INCOME OF $3.02 BILLION IN 2007 WAS $393 MILLION, OR 15%, HIGHER THAN OPERATING INCOME OF $2.62 BILLION IN 2006, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASES IN NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND NET INVESTMENT INCOME, THE CONTINUATION OF FAVORABLE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR RESULTS AND THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN TAX MATTERS. IN ADDITION, RESULTS IN 2007

BENEFITED FROM THE CHANGE TO THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND A DECLINE IN FEE INCOME IN 2007.

NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2007 AND 2006 TOTALED $301 MILLION AND $21 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2007 TOTALED $4 MILLION, COMPARED WITH NO

CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2006.

EARNED PREMIUMS

EARNED PREMIUMS OF $11.18 BILLION IN 2008 DECREASED $103 MILLION, OR 1%, FROM 2007, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE

MARKET CONDITIONS ON PRICING AND NEW BUSINESS. EARNED PREMIUMS OF $11.28 BILLION IN 2007 INCREASED 4% OVER 2006 EARNED PREMIUMS OF $10.88 BILLION, REFLECTING THE GROWTH IN NET WRITTEN

PREMIUM VOLUME IN THE MAJORITY OF THE MARKETS COMPRISING THIS SEGMENT, DRIVEN BY STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION RATES AND INCREASES IN NEW BUSINESS VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MINOR DECREASES IN RENEWAL

PRICE CHANGES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

REFER TO THE "NET INVESTMENT INCOME" SECTION OF "CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" HEREIN FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGE IN THE

COMPANY'S NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN 2008 AND 2007 AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

FEE INCOME

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FEE INCOME DUE TO ITS SERVICE BUSINESSES, WHICH INCLUDE CLAIM AND LOSS PREVENTION SERVICES

TO LARGE COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE TO SELF-INSURE A PORTION OF THEIR INSURANCE RISKS, AND CLAIMS AND POLICY MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS. THE

$118 MILLION AND $83 MILLION DECLINES IN FEE INCOME IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER SERVICED PREMIUM VOLUME DUE TO THE DEPOPULATION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION

RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS, THE IMPACT OF LOWER LOSS COSTS ON FEE INCOME (SINCE FEES ARE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF LOSSES OR NUMBER OF CLAIMS SERVICED, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE DECLINED DUE TO

WORKERS' COMPENSATION REFORMS IN NUMEROUS STATES), AND LOWER NEW BUSINESS VOLUME DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION.

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2008 TOTALED $6.61 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $65 MILLION, OR 1%, OVER 2007,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE COST OF CATASTROPHES, A SMALL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE PROPERTY LOSSES AND THE IMPACT OF LOSS COST TRENDS, WHICH WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY AN

INCREASE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE COST OF CATASTROPHES INCLUDED IN CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2008 TOTALED $642 MILLION, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM

HURRICANES IKE AND GUSTAV AS WELL AS WIND, RAIN AND HAIL STORMS IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2007 WERE $4 MILLION. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2008 AND 2007 TOTALED $1.12 BILLION AND $301 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT IN 2008 WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS RESULTS

PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED

IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PRODUCT LINES, AN INCREASE IN ANTICIPATED CEDED RECOVERIES FOR OLDER ACCIDENT YEARS IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE AND BETTER THAN

ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINES. THE NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

LINES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY

PRODUCT LINE IMPROVEMENT OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN THE 2007 ACCIDENT YEAR AS A RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR CERTAIN LARGE NATIONAL PROPERTY, NATIONAL PROGRAMS, AND OCEAN MARINE

CLAIM EXPOSURES AND LOWER THAN EXPECTED WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES DURING THE LAST HALF OF 2007, AS WELL AS FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN CERTAIN LARGE INLAND MARINE CLAIM EXPOSURES AND IN CEDED

RECOVERIES FOR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY LARGE CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND PROPERTY PRODUCT LINES' 2005 ACCIDENT YEAR RESULTS EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENT DUE TO THE LITIGATION

ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO, AND ONGOING CLAIM SETTLEMENTS FOR, HURRICANE KATRINA. THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE IMPROVEMENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND

JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE FOREGOING PRODUCT LINES IN 2008 WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION PRODUCT LINE, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED MEDICAL COSTS RELATED TO 2004 AND PRIOR

ACCIDENT YEARS, AND BY $70 MILLION AND $85 MILLION INCREASES TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTIONS HEREIN.

NET

FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT OF $301 MILLION IN 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS IN THE COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL, GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE AND PROPERTY PRODUCT LINES. THE COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND GENERAL

79

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIABILITY

PRODUCT LINES EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK

CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT DUE TO MORE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS,

CLAIM HANDLING INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF INSURANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN AUTO SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE EXPERIENCED FEWER THAN EXPECTED LATE REPORTED CLAIMS

RELATED TO NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER EVENTS THAT OCCURRED LATE IN 2006, AS WELL AS BETTER THAN EXPECTED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY DUE IN PART TO CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, SUCH AS HIGHER

DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER POLICY LIMITS. IN ADDITION, THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LARGE LOSS OUTCOMES WHICH WERE PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAVORABLE LITIGATION RESOLUTIONS.

NET TOTAL PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2007 INCLUDED A $185 MILLION INCREASE TO ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES. (REFER TO THE "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTION HEREIN FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION.)

CLAIMS

AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IN 2007 OF $6.67 BILLION DECLINED BY $180 MILLION, OR 3%, FROM THE 2006 TOTAL OF $6.85 BILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE

IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT AND CONTINUED FAVORABLE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR RESULTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN BUSINESS VOLUME. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT

IN 2006 TOTALED $21 MILLION.

IN

2006, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL, GENERAL LIABILITY, PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LINES OF BUSINESS WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY

INCREASES TOTALING $275 MILLION TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES AND RESERVE STRENGTHENING FOR ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS IN RUNOFF. THE COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND LIABILITY LINES OF

BUSINESS EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 THAT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVING LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL,

UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 IN THE PROPERTY LINE OF BUSINESS PRIMARILY REFLECTED LESS "DEMAND SURGE" INFLATION THAN ORIGINALLY

ESTIMATED FOR 2005 ACCIDENT YEAR NON-CATASTROPHE AND CATASTROPHE LOSSES. "DEMAND SURGE" REFERS TO SIGNIFICANT SHORT-TERM INCREASES IN BUILDING MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS DUE TO A

SHARP INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR THOSE MATERIALS AND SERVICES. THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MORE FAVORABLE LEGAL

AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, CLAIM HANDLING INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF INSURANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN AUTO SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. THE RESERVE STRENGTHENING IN ASSUMED REINSURANCE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN PROJECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT DRIVEN BY AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN THE CLAIM SETTLEMENT PATTERNS OF THE UNDERLYING CASUALTY EXPOSURES.

THE

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS TOTALED $1.82 BILLION IN 2008, $76 MILLION, OR 4%, HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE TOTAL OF $1.74 BILLION IN 2007. THE

GROWTH IN AMORTIZATION COSTS PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE HIGHER LEVEL OF AMORTIZED COMMISSION EXPENSE IN 2008 RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY'S IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM IN 2007.

THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS IN 2007 WAS 13% HIGHER THAN THE 2006 TOTAL OF $1.55 BILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTED THE GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME, AS WELL AS A

$108 MILLION INCREASE FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM (DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW" SECTION HEREIN).

GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TOTALED $2.08 BILLION IN 2008, AN INCREASE OF $51 MILLION, OR 3%, OVER THE COMPARABLE 2007 TOTAL OF $2.03 BILLION. THE INCREASE

IN 2008 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF $62 MILLION OF HURRICANE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2007 WERE 4% LOWER THAN THE COMPARABLE TOTAL OF

$2.10 BILLION IN 2006. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF $189 MILLION IN REPORTED GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2007 COMPARED TO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED UNDER THE PRIOR CONTINGENT COMMISSION PROGRAM DURING THOSE PERIODS. THAT REDUCTION WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN

EXPENSES RELATED TO GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME AND CONTINUING EXPENDITURES TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE 2006 TOTAL INCLUDED A PROVISION FOR LEGAL EXPENSES RELATED TO

INVESTIGATIONS OF VARIOUS BUSINESS PRACTICES BY CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.

80

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GAAP COMBINED RATIO

THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2008 OF 57.7% WAS 0.6 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2007 RATIO OF 57.1%. THE COST OF

CATASTROPHES ACCOUNTED FOR 5.7 POINTS OF THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2008, COMPARED WITH NO IMPACT FROM CATASTROPHES IN 2007. NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT PROVIDED

10.0 POINT AND 2.6 POINT BENEFITS TO THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2008 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO ADJUSTED FOR THE COST OF CATASTROPHES

AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS 2.3 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2007 RATIO ON THE SAME BASIS, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS ON PRICING OVER THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS AND

LOSS COST TRENDS, AS WELL AS A SMALL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE PROPERTY LOSSES.

THE

LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 57.1% IN 2007 WAS 3.2 POINTS LOWER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2006 RATIO OF 60.3%. IN 2007, NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT PROVIDED A

2.6 POINT BENEFIT TO THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO, WHEREAS THE 2006 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO INCLUDED A 0.2 POINT BENEFIT FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT.

ADJUSTING FOR THE IMPACT OF PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN BOTH YEARS, THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO IN 2007 WAS 0.8 POINTS BETTER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2006 RATIO, REFLECTING FAVORABLE

CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR RESULTS IN 2007.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 32.5% IN 2008 WAS 1.8 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2007 RATIO OF 30.7%. THE 2008 EXPENSE RATIO INCLUDED A 0.6 POINT IMPACT OF THE HURRICANE-RELATED

ASSESSMENTS, WHEREAS THE 2007 RATIO INCLUDED A 0.7 POINT BENEFIT FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM DESCRIBED IN THE "CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW" SECTION HEREIN. ADJUSTING

FOR THESE FACTORS IN BOTH YEARS, THE ADJUSTED 2008 EXPENSE RATIO WAS 0.5 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE ADJUSTED EXPENSE RATIO FOR 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH

AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, THE IMPACT OF A DECLINE IN THE RATE OF EARNED PREMIUM GROWTH RELATIVE TO EXPENSE GROWTH, AND DECLINES IN FEE INCOME. A PORTION OF FEE INCOME IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF

EXPENSES FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE EXPENSE RATIO.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 30.7% IN 2007, WHICH INCLUDED A 0.7 POINT BENEFIT RESULTING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM, WAS 0.1 POINTS HIGHER

THAN THE 2006 RATIO, REFLECTING THE INCREASES IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND THE IMPACT OF A DECLINE IN FEE INCOME.

BUSINESS INSURANCE CORE, GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2008 DECREASED BY 3% AND 1% FROM 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIFFERENCE IN RATES OF DECLINE BETWEEN GROSS AND NET WRITTEN

PREMIUMS IN 2008 WAS CONCENTRATED IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, WHERE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS IS CEDED TO OTHER INSURERS AND RESIDUAL MARKET POOLS. AS A RESULT, THE DECLINE IN GROSS

WRITTEN PREMIUMS DID NOT HAVE A PROPORTIONAL IMPACT ON NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS. NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH IN THE INDUSTRY-FOCUSED UNDERWRITING, SELECT ACCOUNTS AND COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS GROUPS GENERALLY

REFLECTED HIGHER

BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS AND NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN SEVERAL BUSINESS UNITS WITHIN THESE GROUPS. THIS WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY PREMIUM DECLINES IN SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION, TARGET RISK UNDERWRITING AND

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS.

IN

2007, BUSINESS INSURANCE CORE GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS DECLINED $49 MILLION, OR LESS THAN 1%, FROM THE COMPARABLE 2006 TOTAL, WHEREAS NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS INCREASED

$245 MILLION, OR 2%, COMPARED WITH 2006. THE DIFFERENCE IN GROWTH RATES BETWEEN GROSS AND NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2007 WAS ALSO CONCENTRATED IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS DUE TO THE SAME FACTOR

DESCRIBED ABOVE. ALL MARKETS IN BUSINESS INSURANCE CORE OPERATIONS, EXCEPT NATIONAL ACCOUNTS AND SPECIALIZED DISTRIBUTION, RECORDED NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH IN 2007, DRIVEN BY HIGHER NEW BUSINESS

VOLUME THROUGHOUT THE MAJORITY OF MARKETS COUPLED WITH CONTINUED STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION RATES, OFFSET IN SOME MARKETS BY MINOR DECREASES IN RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES. NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH IN 2007

ALSO BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN CEDED PREMIUMS RELATED TO CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE.

A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON ITS NEW BUSINESS VOLUME FROM ITS ENHANCED QUOTE-TO-ISSUE AGENCY PLATFORM AND MULTIVARIATE PRICING PROGRAM FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES SERVED BY SELECT

ACCOUNTS. HOWEVER, NEW BUSINESS VOLUME FOR LARGER ACCOUNTS IN 2008 DECLINED FROM 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS.

NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $2.71 BILLION IN 2007 GREW 2% OVER 2006. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME INCREASED OVER 2006, DUE IN PART TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPANY'S ENHANCED

QUOTE-TO-ISSUE AGENCY PLATFORM AND MULTIVARIATE PRICING PROGRAM IN 37 STATES. ENHANCED MARKETING EFFORTS AND ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS SOLD TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO

NEW BUSINESS GROWTH IN 2007. BUSINESS RETENTION RATES REMAINED STRONG IN 2007. RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES IN THIS MARKET REMAINED POSITIVE IN 2007 BUT WERE LOWER THAN IN 2006, AS PRICE INCREASES FOR

COASTAL COVERAGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES FOR NON-COASTAL COVERAGES, WHICH CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE GROWTH IN NEW BUSINESS VOLUME REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS SOLD TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND INCREASED MARKETING EFFORTS. RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES IN THIS MARKET

DECLINED FROM 2006 AND WERE NEGATIVE IN 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS.

NATIONAL ACCOUNTS.

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $1.00 BILLION IN 2008 DECREASED 6% FROM 2007. THE DECLINE PRIMARILY REFLECTED A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE

IN RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES, AS THE PRICE CHARGED FOR NATIONAL ACCOUNTS' PRODUCTS IS ADJUSTED BASED ON ACTUAL LOSS PERFORMANCE, WHICH CONTINUES TO BE FAVORABLE DUE TO WORKERS' COMPENSATION REFORMS.

OVERALL NEW BUSINESS VOLUME INCREASED SLIGHTLY OVER 2007. BUSINESS RETENTION RATES IN 2008 REMAINED STRONG AND INCREASED OVER 2007.

RECORDED NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH IN 2008. GROWTH IN CONSTRUCTION NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2008 WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG BUSINESS RETENTION LEVELS COUPLED WITH CONTINUED STRONG NEW BUSINESS VOLUME. AN

INCREASE IN NEW BUSINESS VOLUME WAS THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN THE GROWTH IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN THE OIL & GAS BUSINESS UNIT. IN AGRIBUSINESS, NET WRITTEN PREMIUM GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES

IN BUSINESS RETENTION RATES AND RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES. IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR BUSINESS UNIT, THE INCREASE IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER NEW BUSINESS VOLUME COUPLED WITH CONTINUED STRONG

BUSINESS RETENTION RATES.

NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $2.30 BILLION IN 2007 INCREASED 5% OVER 2006. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS UNIT, WHERE FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTED TO

HIGHER NEW BUSINESS VOLUME; THE OIL & GAS BUSINESS UNIT, DUE TO INCREASED BUSINESS RETENTION RATES AND STRONG RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES; AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR UNIT, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RETENTION

RATES. IN ADDITION, STRONG NEW BUSINESS VOLUME AND BUSINESS RETENTION RATES IN THE AGRIBUSINESS BUSINESS UNIT CONTRIBUTED TO PREMIUM GROWTH IN 2007. NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN THE TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS

NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $1.59 BILLION IN 2008 DECREASED 4% FROM 2007. THE DECLINE WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE

NATIONAL

REDUCTIONS IN BUSINESS RETENTION RATES AND NEW BUSINESS VOLUME DUE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, THE GLOBAL ACCOUNTS BUSINESS UNIT EXPERIENCED A REDUCTION IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS DUE TO

DECLINES IN BUSINESS RETENTION RATES, RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES AND NEW

BUSINESS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECLINES IN THESE BUSINESS UNITS WAS AN INCREASE IN NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN THE EXCESS CASUALTY BUSINESS UNIT, WHERE RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES REMAINED NEGATIVE BUT

NET

WRITTEN PREMIUMS OF $1.67 BILLION IN 2007 GREW 2% OVER 2006, DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN THE INLAND MARINE AND NATIONAL PROPERTY BUSINESS UNITS. STRONG GROWTH IN NEW BUSINESS

CEDED FOR CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES, WHICH WERE NEGATIVE. GROWTH IN THESE TWO BUSINESS UNITS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN EXCESS

OPERATING

INCOME OF $675 MILLION IN 2007 WAS $66 MILLION, OR 11%, HIGHER THAN OPERATING INCOME OF $609 MILLION IN 2006, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN NET

PROCESS, THEREBY CHANGING HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. IN ADDITION, INDUSTRY AND COMPANY INITIATIVES TO FIGHT FRAUD IN SEVERAL STATES LED TO A DECREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS AND A

CHANGE IN HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS, FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 WAS PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE

NUMBER OF CLAIMS, ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND FEWER SMALL-DOLLAR CLAIMS. THESE CHANGES ALSO RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT

PATTERNS. IN ADDITION, FOR 2006, NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LOSS EXPERIENCE WAS FAVORABLE DUE TO CONTINUED EVIDENCE OF A LESS THAN EXPECTED IMPACT FROM "DEMAND SURGE,"

WHICH REFERS TO SIGNIFICANT SHORT-TERM INCREASES IN BUILDING MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS DUE TO A SHARP INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR THOSE MATERIALS AND SERVICES. APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION

OF NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 RESULTED FROM A REDUCTION IN LOSS ESTIMATES FOR CATASTROPHES INCURRED IN 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER THAN EXPECTED ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSE

LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA.

CATASTROPHE

LOSSES IN 2007 TOTALED $163 MILLION, $60 MILLION HIGHER THAN THE 2006 TOTAL OF $103 MILLION. CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN 2007 WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA AND SEVERAL STORMS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, WHEREAS THE 2006 TOTAL WAS DRIVEN BY SEVERAL WIND, RAIN, HAIL AND SNOW STORMS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS TOTALED $1.41 BILLION IN 2008, COMPARED WITH $1.31 BILLION IN 2007. THE GROWTH IN AMORTIZATION COSTS IN 2008 PRIMARILY

REFLECTED THE HIGHER LEVEL OF AMORTIZED COMMISSION EXPENSE IN 2008 RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY'S IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM IN 2007, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN BUSINESS

VOLUME.

THE

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS TOTALED $1.31 BILLION IN 2007, $156 MILLION, OR 14%, HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2006 TOTAL OF $1.15 BILLION. THE

INCREASE INCLUDED $94 MILLION FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM IN 2007 DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW" SECTION HEREIN, AS WELL AS

GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE SALE OF MENDOTA

GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TOTALED $829 MILLION IN 2008, AN INCREASE OF $130 MILLION, OR 19% OVER THE 2007 TOTAL OF $699 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN 2008

INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF $77 MILLION OF HURRICANE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. THE REMAINING INCREASE REFLECTED GROWTH IN BUSINESS VOLUME AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT.

GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TOTALED $699 MILLION IN 2007, A DECREASE OF $105 MILLION, OR 13%, FROM THE 2006 TOTAL OF $804 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN EXPENSES

IN 2007 PRIMARILY REFLECTED A DECLINE IN COMMISSION EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE SALE OF MENDOTA, WHICH WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO

INCREASED BUSINESS VOLUME, AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM IN 2007 RESULTED IN A

$165 MILLION REDUCTION IN REPORTED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, COMPARED TO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED UNDER THE PRIOR CONTINGENT COMMISSION PROGRAM.

GAAP COMBINED RATIO

THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 66.2% IN 2008 WAS 7.6 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2007 RATIO OF 58.6%. THE 2008

RATIO INCLUDED A 7.8 POINT IMPACT OF THE COST OF CATASTROPHES AND A 2.1 POINT BENEFIT FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, WHEREAS THE 2007 RATIO INCLUDED A 2.4 POINT IMPACT OF THE COST

OF CATASTROPHES AND A 2.2 POINT BENEFIT FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE 2008 LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO ADJUSTED FOR CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT WAS 2.1 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2007 RATIO ON THE SAME BASIS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER RELATED LOSSES IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND

OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS AND LOSS COST TRENDS.

THE

LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO OF 58.6% IN 2007 WAS 3.8 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE COMPARABLE 2006 RATIO OF 54.8%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE DECLINE IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR

RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE RATIO IN 2007 INCLUDED A 2.2 POINT BENEFIT FROM NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, COMPARED WITH A 5.5 POINT BENEFIT IN 2006. CATASTROPHE LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR 2.4

POINTS AND 1.6 POINTS, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIOS IN 2007 AND 2006. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT AND CATASTROPHES IN BOTH YEARS, THE ADJUSTED 2007

LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RATIO WAS 0.3 POINTS LOWER THAN THE ADJUSTED 2006 RATIO.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO OF 30.8% IN 2008 WAS 2.6 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2007 RATIO OF 28.2%. THE 2008 RATIO INCLUDED A 1.1 POINT IMPACT FROM HURRICANE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS, WHEREAS

THE 2007 RATIO INCLUDED A 1.0 POINT BENEFIT FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM DESCRIBED IN THE "CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW" SECTION HEREIN. ADJUSTING FOR THESE FACTORS,

THE 2008 EXPENSE RATIO WAS 0.5 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE ADJUSTED EXPENSE RATIO FOR 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

THE

UNDERWRITING EXPENSE RATIO IN 2007, EXCLUDING THE 1.0 POINT BENEFIT FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FIXED AGENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM, WAS 0.9 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2006 EXPENSE

RATIO OF 28.3%, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF CONTINUED INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

IN

THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2007 DECLINED 2%, FROM 2006. ADJUSTING FOR THE IMPACT OF THE SALE OF MENDOTA, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF

BUSINESS IN 2007 INCREASED 2% OVER 2006. THAT GROWTH PRIMARILY REFLECTED RENEWAL PRICE CHANGE INCREASES COUPLED WITH CONTINUED STRONG RETENTION RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NEW BUSINESS

VOLUME DUE TO COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS.

IN

THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN 2007 GREW 6% OVER 2006, PRIMARILY REFLECTING RENEWAL PRICE CHANGE INCREASES, PARTICULARLY FOR COASTAL COVERAGES,

COUPLED WITH CONTINUED STRONG RETENTION RATES. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME IN THIS LINE OF BUSINESS IN 2007 DECLINED FROM 2006, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STRATEGIES TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO LOSSES ON THE ATLANTIC AND

GULF COASTS OF THE UNITED STATES. ADJUSTING FOR THE SALE OF MENDOTA FOR BOTH YEARS, NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS IN 2007 INCREASED 7% OVER 2006.

THE

$48 MILLION INCREASE IN NET LOSS FOR INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER IN 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A $52 MILLION BENEFIT IN 2007 RESULTING FROM THE

FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS PRIOR YEAR TAX MATTERS. THE NET LOSS IN 2008 INCLUDED AFTER-TAX INTEREST EXPENSE OF $239 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $224 MILLION IN 2007. THE NET

LOSS IN 2007 ALSO INCLUDED AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $25 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S REDEMPTION OF ITS 4.50% CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES IN APRIL 2007, CONSISTING OF THE

REDEMPTION PREMIUM PAID AND THE WRITE-OFF OF REMAINING DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS.

THE

$46 MILLION INCREASE IN NET LOSS FOR INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER IN 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF DEBT REDEMPTIONS IN EACH YEAR. THE NET LOSS IN 2007

INCLUDED THE AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $25 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S REDEMPTION OF ITS 4.50% CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES. CONVERSELY, THE NET LOSS IN 2006 WAS REDUCED BY A

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED FROM COURT DECISIONS AND OTHER TRENDS THAT HAVE

ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS CLAIMS FAR BEYOND THE INTENT OF INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN ASBESTOS CLAIMS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS FROM THE COMPANY'S POLICYHOLDERS (WHICH INCLUDES OTHERS SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER A POLICY), INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST THE

COMPANY'S POLICYHOLDERS BY INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT APPEAR TO BE IMPAIRED BY ASBESTOS EXPOSURE. FACTORS UNDERLYING THESE CLAIM FILINGS INCLUDE INTENSIVE ADVERTISING BY LAWYERS SEEKING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS

AND THE FOCUS BY PLAINTIFFS ON PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. THE FOCUS ON THESE DEFENDANTS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT BANKRUPTCY

PROTECTION IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLAIMS, BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED LOSSES BY INITIALLY DELAYING THE

REPORTING OF CLAIMS AND LATER BY SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATING AND INCREASING LOSS PAYMENTS BY INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS HAVE ALSO CAUSED INCREASED SETTLEMENT DEMANDS

AGAINST THOSE POLICYHOLDERS WHO ARE NOT IN BANKRUPTCY BUT THAT REMAIN IN THE TORT SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, THOSE WHO ALLEGE VERY SERIOUS INJURY AND WHO CAN PRESENT CREDIBLE MEDICAL

EVIDENCE OF THEIR INJURIES ARE RECEIVING PRIORITY TRIAL SETTINGS IN THE COURTS, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SHOWN ANY CREDIBLE DISEASE MANIFESTATION ARE HAVING THEIR HEARING DATES DELAYED OR PLACED ON AN

INACTIVE DOCKET. THIS TREND OF PRIORITIZING CLAIMS INVOLVING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF INJURIES, ALONG WITH THE FOCUS ON PREVIOUSLY PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE PAYMENTS

EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE EXPERIENCE ALSO HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE

TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN COVERAGE LITIGATION CONCERNING A NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY, WHO IN SOME INSTANCES HAVE ASSERTED THAT ALL OR

A PORTION OF THEIR ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LIMITS ON COVERAGE. IN THESE INSTANCES, POLICYHOLDERS ALSO MAY ASSERT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL BODILY INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE TREATED

AS A SEPARATE OCCURRENCE UNDER THE POLICY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER THESE POLICYHOLDERS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON BOTH ISSUES. TO THE EXTENT BOTH ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN A POLICYHOLDERS' FAVOR

AND OTHER COMPANY DEFENSES ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL, THE COMPANY'S COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE POLICIES AT ISSUE WOULD BE MATERIALLY INCREASED AND BOUNDED ONLY BY THE APPLICABLE

PER-OCCURRENCE LIMITS AND THE NUMBER OF ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST THE POLICYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS SEEN A MODERATION IN THE OVERALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

THESE LAWSUITS, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE COST OF THESE CLAIMS.

MANY

COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH POLICYHOLDERS ARE ONLY RESOLVED THROUGH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE MANY POLICYHOLDERS MAKE EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. SETTLEMENTS INVOLVING BANKRUPT POLICYHOLDERS MAY INCLUDE EXTENSIVE RELEASES WHICH ARE FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY BUT WHICH COULD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS FOR LARGER AMOUNTS THAN

ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. THERE ALSO MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE A COURT MAY NOT APPROVE A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND POTENTIALLY LESS BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FOR THE

COMPANY. AS IN THE PAST, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

ON

JULY 6, 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT TO RESOLVE FULLY ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED COVERAGE CLAIMS RELATING TO ACANDS, INC.

(ACANDS), FORMERLY A NATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR AND INSTALLER OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS. PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY PLACED $449 MILLION INTO ESCROW. THE SETTLEMENT WAS SUBJECT TO A

NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES, ALL

92

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF

WHICH HAVE BEEN FULFILLED. ON AUGUST 6, 2008, THE COMPANY'S $449 MILLION SETTLEMENT PAYMENT WAS RELEASED FROM THE ESCROW TO THE ACANDS TRUST. THIS TRANSACTION WAS RECORDED AS A PAID

CLAIM AND REDUCTION IN CLAIM RESERVES, AND ACCORDINGLY, THERE WAS NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY IS SEEKING TO RECOVER APPROXIMATELY $84 MILLION OF THE

$449 MILLION FROM REINSURERS; SUCH A RECOVERY WOULD ALSO HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN

ADDITION TO CLAIMS AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED DIRECTLY AGAINST INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, BY INDIVIDUALS CHALLENGING INSURERS' CONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO

THE HANDLING OF PAST ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURIES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE FILING OF OTHER DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST

INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, IN THE FUTURE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIONS AGAINST INSURERS

BASED ON NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THESE CLAIMS AND HAS RECEIVED FAVORABLE RULINGS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.

TRAVELERS

PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC), A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, HAD ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, WHICH HAD BEEN APPROVED BY THE COURT IN CONNECTION WITH THE

PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY TPC IN THE JOHNS MANVILLE BANKRUPTCY COURT. ON MARCH 29, 2006, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SUBSTANTIALLY AFFIRMED THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT'S ORDERS, WHILE VACATING THAT PORTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT'S ORDERS WHICH REQUIRED ALL FUTURE DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST TPC TO FIRST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT BEFORE PROCEEDING IN

STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. VARIOUS PARTIES APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURT'S MARCH 29, 2006 RULING TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. ON FEBRUARY 15, 2008, THE SECOND CIRCUIT

ISSUED AN OPINION VACATING ON JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS THE DISTRICT COURT'S APPROVAL OF AN ORDER ISSUED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT PROHIBITING THE PROSECUTION OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE

COMMON LAW CLAIMS, AS WELL AS FUTURE SIMILAR DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION, AGAINST TPC. ON FEBRUARY 29, 2008, TPC AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTIES TO THE APPEALS FILED PETITIONS FOR REHEARING AND/OR

REHEARING

EN BANC

, REQUESTING REINSTATEMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S JUDGMENT, WHICH WERE DENIED. TPC AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTIES FILED PETITIONS FOR WRIT

OF CERTIORARI IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SEEKING REVIEW OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S DECISION AND ON DECEMBER 12, 2008, THE PETITIONS WERE GRANTED. UNLESS THE SUPREME COURT REVERSES THE

SECOND CIRCUIT'S DECISION, AND THE BANKRUPTCY COURT'S ORDER IS REINSTATED AND BECOMES FINAL, THE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE VOIDED AND TPC WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS (OTHER THAN CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES). IN THAT CASE, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO LITIGATE THE DIRECT ACTION CASES VIGOROUSLY. (FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THESE MATTERS, SEE

"PART IITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS").

BECAUSE

EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AT LEAST ANNUALLY. IN THE COURSE OF

THIS REVIEW, THE COMPANY GENERALLY CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF

ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND

ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF

ANY, OF NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION

AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM.

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IN-DEPTH ASBESTOS CLAIM REVIEW. THE TRENDS OBSERVED OVER THE PAST THREE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY CONSISTENT.

THE TRENDS INCLUDE.



MORE STABLE PAYMENT TRENDS FOR A LARGE PROPORTION OF POLICYHOLDERS;



A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW CLAIMS RECEIVED;

93

TABLE OF CONTENTS



A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE ASBESTOS EXPOSURES CONFRONTING THE COMPANY DUE TO ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY;



FEWER AND LESS VOLATILE ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCIES; AND



THE ABSENCE OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR NEW CLASSES OF DEFENDANTS.

WHILE

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE TRENDS INDICATE A REDUCTION IN THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S OVERALL ASBESTOS EXPOSURE, THERE NONETHELESS REMAINS A HIGH DEGREE OF

UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE FROM ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

AS

IN PRIOR YEARS, THE ANNUAL CLAIM REVIEW CONSIDERED ACTIVE POLICYHOLDERS AND LITIGATION CASES FOR POTENTIAL PRODUCT AND "NON-PRODUCT" LIABILITY. THE HOME OFFICE AND FIELD

OFFICE CATEGORIES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICYHOLDERS WITH ACTIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS, AGAIN EXPERIENCED AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN NEW CLAIM FILINGS IN 2008. THE NUMBER OF

POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING ASBESTOS CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE NUMBER TENDERING CLAIMS IN 2007. DEFENSE AND INDEMNITY COSTS IN THESE CATEGORIES REMAIN AT SIMILAR LEVELS TO WHAT THE

COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE LEVEL OF TRIAL ACTIVITY INVOLVING IMPAIRED INDIVIDUALS.

THE

COMPANY'S QUARTERLY ASBESTOS RESERVE REVIEW INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. DEVELOPING PAYMENT TRENDS AMONG POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE, FIELD OFFICE AND ASSUMED AND INTERNATIONAL CATEGORIES ARE ALSO ANALYZED. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE, YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS

SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. FOR CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS AN ESTIMATE OF THE GROSS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR INDEMNITY AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE IS DETERMINED, AND FOR THOSE

POLICYHOLDERS THE COMPANY CALCULATES, BY EACH POLICY YEAR, A CEDED REINSURANCE PROJECTION BASED ON ANY APPLICABLE FACULTATIVE AND TREATY REINSURANCE, PAST CEDED EXPERIENCE AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS.

CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES NOR HAVE THE COMPANY'S EVALUATIONS RESULTED IN ANY WAY OF DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY

PAYMENT.

NET

ASBESTOS LOSSES AND EXPENSES PAID IN 2008 WERE $658 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $317 MILLION IN 2007. THE INCREASE IN NET PAID LOSSES WAS THE RESULT OF THE ACANDS PAYMENT IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008. EXCLUDING THE ACANDS SETTLEMENT, PAYMENTS IN 2008 WERE $293 MILLION. APPROXIMATELY 59% AND 20% OF TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO

POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANY'S LIABILITY.

COMPANY CATEGORIZES ITS ASBESTOS RESERVES AS FOLLOWS.

THE

"POLICYHOLDERS WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS" CATEGORY INCLUDES STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS, COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS AND, WITH RESPECT TO TPC, WELLINGTON ACCOUNTS. RESERVES ARE BASED

ON THE EXPECTED PAYOUT FOR EACH POLICYHOLDER UNDER THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENT. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS ARE ARRANGEMENTS UNDER WHICH POLICYHOLDERS AND/OR PLAINTIFFS AGREE TO FIXED FINANCIAL AMOUNTS TO BE

PAID AT SCHEDULED TIMES. INCLUDED IN THIS CATEGORY ARE TPC'S SETTLEMENTS OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS

94

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND

THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS (COLLECTIVELY THE DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENT). AS STATED ABOVE UNLESS THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S DECISION VACATING THE APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT IS REVERSED AND THE BANKRUPTCY

COURT'S ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT IS REINSTATED AND BECOMES FINAL, THE DIRECT ACTION SETTLEMENT WILL BE VOIDED AND TPC WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNTS UNDER THE DIRECT ACTION

SETTLEMENT (OTHER THAN CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES). IN THAT EVENT, THE RESERVES ASSIGNED TO THE SETTLEMENT WILL BE RETURNED TO TPC'S UNALLOCATED ASBESTOS RESERVE. (FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THESE

MATTERS, SEE "ITEM 3LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"). COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS REPRESENT AGREEMENTS WITH MAJOR POLICYHOLDERS ON SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE TO BE PROVIDED. PAYMENT

OBLIGATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL MAXIMUMS AND ARE ONLY MADE WHEN VALID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED. WELLINGTON ACCOUNTS REFER TO THE 35 DEFENDANTS THAT ARE PARTIES TO A 1985 AGREEMENT SETTLING CERTAIN

DISPUTES CONCERNING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEIR ASBESTOS CLAIMS. MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF THE WELLINGTON AGREEMENT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF COVERAGE IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE

AGREED ON SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE AND THE TERMS UNDER WHICH THE COVERAGE CAN BE ACCESSED.

THE

"HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE" CATEGORY RELATES TO ALL OTHER POLICYHOLDERS AND ALSO INCLUDES UNALLOCATED IBNR RESERVES. POLICYHOLDERS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR HOME OFFICE REVIEW BASED

UPON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: A COMBINATION OF PAST PAYMENTS AND CURRENT CASE RESERVES IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED THRESHOLD (CURRENTLY $100,000), PERCEIVED LEVEL OF EXPOSURE, NUMBER OF REPORTED CLAIMS,

PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATIONS AND POTENTIAL "NON-PRODUCT" EXPOSURES, SIZE OF POLICYHOLDER AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD BY THE POLICYHOLDER. IN ADDITION TO IBNR

AMOUNTS CONTAINED IN THE RESERVES FOR HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE POLICYHOLDERS AND THE COSTS OF LITIGATING ASBESTOS COVERAGE MATTERS, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A RESERVE FOR FURTHER ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO EXISTING POLICYHOLDERS, NEW CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS REPORTING CLAIMS FOR THE

FIRST TIME AND POLICYHOLDERS FOR WHICH THERE IS, OR MAY BE, LITIGATION AND DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY.

ON

JANUARY 29, 2009, THE COMPANY AND PPG INDUSTRIES, INC ("PPG"), ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY 30 OTHER INSURERS OF PPG, AGREED IN PRINCIPLE ON A MODIFIED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO

SETTLE ASBESTOS-RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO PPG. THE TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE MODIFIED THIRD AMENDED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

("AMENDED PLAN") PROPOSED AS PART OF THE PITTSBURGH CORNING CORP. ("PCC", WHICH IS 50% OWNED BY PPG) BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. PURSUANT TO THE PROPOSED AMENDED PLAN, WHICH WAS FILED ON JANUARY 30,

2009, PCC, ALONG WITH ENUMERATED OTHER COMPANIES (INCLUDING PPG AS WELL AS THE COMPANY AS A PARTICIPATING INSURER), ARE TO RECEIVE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE

FROM CERTAIN ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO A PRIOR AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH PPG IN 2002 WHICH WAS CONTINGENT UPON FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE SECOND AMENDED

PLAN OF REORGANIZATION FOR PCC, BUT IN DECEMBER 2006, THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT DECLINED TO CONFIRM THAT PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. AS A RESULT OF THE DECEMBER 2006 RULING, THE COMPANY REMOVED

THE RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIOR AGREEMENT FROM THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT CATEGORY OF THE ASBESTOS RESERVE AND MADE A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE UNALLOCATED ASBESTOS IBNR RESERVE. UNDER THE

CURRENT AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO MAKE A SERIES OF PAYMENTS OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $620 MILLION TO THE TRUST TO BE CREATED UNDER THE

AMENDED PLAN, OR IT MAY ELECT TO MAKE A ONE-TIME DISCOUNTED PAYMENT, WHICH, AS OF JUNE 30, 2009, WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $430 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION

AFTER REINSURANCE). THE CURRENT AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH PPG IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE AMENDED PLAN, AND THE COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE THE

SETTLEMENT PAYMENT UNTIL ALL CONTINGENCIES ARE SATISFIED. THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE CONTINUE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE UNALLOCATED ASBESTOS IBNR RESERVE.

ASSUMED

REINSURANCE EXPOSURE PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF REINSURANCE OF EXCESS COVERAGE, INCLUDING VARIOUS POOL PARTICIPATIONS. PRIOR TO THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA IN DECEMBER 2008,

INTERNATIONAL WAS EXPOSED TO U.S. ASBESTOS LIABILITIES THROUGH PARTICIPATIONS IN EXCESS INSURANCE POLICIES, QUOTA SHARE AND EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE POLICIES, AND RETROCESSION POLICIES, UNDERWRITTEN

IN THE LONDON INSURANCE

95

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET.

DETAILS OF EXPOSURES UNDER THE REINSURANCE AND RETROCESSION POLICIES WERE IDENTIFIED ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY WAS ADVISED BY THE CEDANT.

IN

DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA, WHICH COMPRISED ITS UNITED KINGDOM-BASED RUNOFF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES. INCLUDED IN THE CLAIM AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES TRANSFERRED TO THE PURCHASER WERE GROSS AND NET ASBESTOS RESERVES OF $330 MILLION AND $232 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

COMPANY RECORDED A $70 MILLION PRETAX INCREASE TO ASBESTOS RESERVES IN 2008. THE COMPANY RECORDED NO ASBESTOS RESERVE ADDITIONS IN 2007, AND RECORDED A PRETAX ASBESTOS RESERVE

ADDITION OF $155 MILLION IN 2006. THE 2008 INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

LITIGATING ASBESTOS COVERAGE MATTERS AND A CHANGE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDERS. THE INCREASE WAS NOT A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF THE UNDERLYING

ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE $155 MILLION 2006 PRETAX RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE PROJECTED DEFENSE COSTS FOR TEN POLICYHOLDERS. THE MAJORITY OF THE

REMAINDER OF THE RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED LITIGATION ACTIVITY AGAINST SMALLER, PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS. NET ASBESTOS RESERVES TOTALED $2.91 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, COMPARED WITH $3.73 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE CLAIMS FROM POLICYHOLDERS WHO ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE LIABLE FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THEIR

ALLEGED DISPOSITION OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. MOSTLY, THESE CLAIMS ARE DUE TO VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS REGULATORY EFFORTS AIMED AT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), ENACTED IN 1980 AND LATER MODIFIED, ENABLES PRIVATE PARTIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO

RELEASES AND THREATENED RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THIS FEDERAL STATUTE PERMITS THE RECOVERY OF RESPONSE COSTS FROM SOME LIABLE PARTIES AND MAY REQUIRE LIABLE PARTIES TO UNDERTAKE THEIR OWN

REMEDIAL ACTION. LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA MAY BE JOINT AND SEVERAL WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, INVOLVED IN LITIGATION INVOLVING INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUES PERTAINING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SOME COURT DECISIONS

HAVE INTERPRETED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE BROADER THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE INSURERS AND POLICYHOLDERS. THESE DECISIONS OFTEN PERTAIN TO INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE ISSUED BY THE COMPANY

PRIOR TO THE MID-1980S. THESE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO BE INCONSISTENT AND VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS WHEN SUBMITTED RARELY INDICATE THE MONETARY AMOUNT

BEING SOUGHT BY

THE CLAIMANT FROM THE POLICYHOLDER, AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE MONETARY AMOUNT BEING SOUGHT IN THOSE FEW CLAIMS WHICH INDICATE A MONETARY AMOUNT.

THE

RESOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES BY THE COMPANY GENERALLY OCCURS BY SETTLEMENT ON A POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER BASIS AS OPPOSED TO A

CLAIM-BY-CLAIM BASIS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY STRIVES TO EXTINGUISH ANY OBLIGATIONS IT MAY HAVE UNDER ANY POLICY ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER FOR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXTINGUISH ANY PENDING COVERAGE LITIGATION DISPUTE WITH THE POLICYHOLDER. THIS FORM OF SETTLEMENT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A "BUY-BACK" OF POLICIES FOR

FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE AGREEMENTS HAVE ALSO EXTINGUISHED ANY INSURANCE OBLIGATION WHICH THE COMPANY MAY HAVE FOR OTHER CLAIMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ASBESTOS

AND OTHER CUMULATIVE INJURY CLAIMS. THE COMPANY AND ITS POLICYHOLDERS MAY ALSO AGREE TO SETTLEMENTS WHICH EXTINGUISH ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM KNOWN SPECIFIED SITES OR CLAIMS. THESE AGREEMENTS ALSO

INCLUDE APPROPRIATE INDEMNITIES AND HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S GENERAL PURPOSE IN EXECUTING THESE AGREEMENTS IS TO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPOSURE AND ELIMINATE THE RISKS PRESENTED BY COVERAGE LITIGATION WITH THE POLICYHOLDER AND RELATED COSTS.

IN

ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS,

THE COMPANY GENERALLY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF SIMILAR EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY

VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE ALLEGATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP

AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED

TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION. CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES.

IN

ITS REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS: PAST SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS; CHANGING JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE TRENDS; ITS RESERVES FOR THE COSTS OF LITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL

COVERAGE MATTERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR POLICYHOLDERS WITH SMALLER EXPOSURES TO BE NAMED IN NEW CLEAN-UP ACTIONS FOR

97

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BOTH

ON- AND OFF-SITE WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES; THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT; THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL NEW CLAIMS BEYOND PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS; AND THE POTENTIAL

HIGHER COSTS FOR NEW SETTLEMENTS.

THE

DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE EXTENT OF TIME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE ESTIMATE, IF ANY, OF THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM TO THE

COMPANY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND ARE DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE COOPERATION OF THE POLICYHOLDER IN PROVIDING CLAIM INFORMATION, THE PACE OF

UNDERLYING LITIGATION OR CLAIM PROCESSES, THE PACE OF COVERAGE LITIGATION BETWEEN THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE POLICYHOLDER AND THE COMPANY TO NEGOTIATE, IF APPROPRIATE,

A RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE PERTAINING TO THESE CLAIMS. BECAUSE THESE FACTORS VARY FROM CLAIM-TO-CLAIM AND POLICYHOLDER-BY-POLICYHOLDER, THE COMPANY

CANNOT PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE OF THE DURATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM. HOWEVER, BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THESE CLAIMS, THE DURATION MAY VARY FROM MONTHS TO SEVERAL

YEARS.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE NOTICES FROM POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THESE POLICYHOLDERS GENERALLY PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE LOWER

TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, IN MANY INSTANCES CLEAN-UP COSTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT RISK-BASED SITE ANALYSES AND MORE EFFICIENT

CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED UPWARD DEVELOPMENT IN THE ANTICIPATED DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PENDING POLICYHOLDERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS

DEVELOPMENT, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE BY $85 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN BOTH THE NUMBER OF NEW POLICYHOLDERS

TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS POLICYHOLDERS PERTAINING TO COVERAGE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A

MODERATION IN THE RATE OF THAT DECLINE IN RECENT YEARS. THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE BY $185 MILLION IN 2007 PRIMARILY IN RESPONSE TO THAT MODERATION. IN 2006, THE COMPANY

INCREASED ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $120 MILLION PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS DRIVEN IN PART BY ADVERSE JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN STATES

REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF COVERAGE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

IN

DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA, WHICH COMPRISED ITS UNITED KINGDOM-BASED RUNOFF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES. INCLUDED IN THE CLAIM AND CLAIM

ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES TRANSFERRED TO THE PURCHASER WERE GROSS AND NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES OF $40 MILLION AND $33 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

NET

PAID LOSSES IN 2008 AND 2007 WERE $128 MILLION AND $113 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY 92% OF THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE

(APPROXIMATELY $381 MILLION) WAS CARRIED IN A BULK RESERVE AND INCLUDED UNRESOLVED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE ANTICIPATED COST OF COVERAGE

LITIGATION DISPUTES RELATING TO THESE CLAIMS. THE BULK RESERVE THE COMPANY CARRIES IS ESTABLISHED AND ADJUSTED BASED UPON THE AGGREGATE VOLUME OF IN-PROCESS ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE

COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING THOSE CLAIMS. THE BALANCE, APPROXIMATELY 8% OF THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE (APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION), CONSISTS OF CASE RESERVES.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES CARRIED FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND LACK OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY

IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS

ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION

OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER PARTICIPATING INSURERS. IN ADDITION, UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS, ALTHOUGH IN RECENT

YEARS THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER AND VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCIES. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT

AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN

APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS

99

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEAR

COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS

OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE. AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONTINUES

TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS. (ALSO, SEE "PART IITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS").

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 TOTALED $70.74 BILLION, OF WHICH 94% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY

AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, 1% IN EQUITY SECURITIES, 1% IN REAL ESTATE AND 4% IN OTHER INVESTMENTS. BECAUSE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS TO FUND FUTURE CLAIMS

PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT ARE DEPLOYED IN A WIDELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, LIQUID

INTERMEDIATE-TERM TAXABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT, TAX-EXEMPT U.S. MUNICIPAL BONDS, AND TAXABLE CORPORATE AND U.S. AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED BONDS.

THE

COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 TOTALED $61.28 BILLION. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND

INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND SALES ARE EXECUTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF HAVING ADEQUATE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, BOTH INCLUDING AND EXCLUDING U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, WAS "AA1" AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007. BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES REPRESENTED 2.0% AND 2.5%

OF THE TOTAL FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, WAS 4.2 AND 4.0 (4.6 AND 4.3 EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS), AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 INCLUDED $39.06 BILLION OF SECURITIES WHICH ARE OBLIGATIONS OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL

SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO). THE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND PUERTO RICO, AND INCLUDES

GENERAL OBLIGATION AND REVENUE BONDS ISSUED BY STATES, CITIES, COUNTIES, SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AND SIMILAR ISSUERS. INCLUDED IN THE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO ARE $5.45 BILLION OF ADVANCE REFUNDED OR

ESCROWED-TO-MATURITY BONDS. ADVANCE REFUNDED AND ESCROWED-TO-MATURITY BONDS ARE BONDS FOR WHICH AN IRREVOCABLE TRUST HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO FUND THE

REMAINING PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. SUCH ESCROW ACCOUNTS ARE VERIFIED AS TO THEIR SUFFICIENCY BY AN EXTERNAL AUDITOR AND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY INVOLVE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. THE FOLLOWING

NO

THE

COMPANY BASES ITS INVESTMENT DECISION ON THE CREDIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MUNICIPAL SECURITY; HOWEVER, WITHIN ITS MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO ARE A NUMBER OF SECURITIES THAT WERE

ENHANCED BY THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF AN ISSUER DEFAULT. THE DOWNGRADE DURING 2008 OF CREDIT RATINGS OF INSURERS OF THESE SECURITIES HAS RESULTED

IN A CORRESPONDING DOWNGRADE IN THE RATINGS OF THE SECURITIES TO THE UNDERLYING RATING OF THE RESPECTIVE SECURITY. OF THE INSURED MUNICIPAL SECURITIES IN THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO,

APPROXIMATELY 99% WERE RATED AT A3 OR ABOVE, AND APPROXIMATELY 81% WERE RATED AT AA3 OR ABOVE, WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A FURTHER LOSS OF THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE

WOULD NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE UNDERLYING CREDIT STRENGTH OF THE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES, AS WELL

AS THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITIES. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE UNDERLYING ISSUERS OF THESE SECURITIES WAS "AA3" AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF

THE ENTIRE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO WAS "AA1" AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WITH AND WITHOUT THE THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY HELD COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (CMBS, INCLUDING FHA PROJECT LOANS) OF $766 MILLION AND $935 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY $258 MILLION OF THESE SECURITIES, OR THE LOANS BACKING SUCH SECURITIES, CONTAIN GUARANTEES BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OR A

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE AND $20 MILLION WERE COMPRISED OF CANADIAN NON-GUARANTEED SECURITIES. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE $508 MILLION OF

NON-GUARANTEED SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS "AAA," AND 93% OF THOSE SECURITIES WERE ISSUED IN 2004 AND PRIOR YEARS. THE CMBS PORTFOLIO IS SUPPORTED BY LOANS THAT ARE

DIVERSIFIED ACROSS ECONOMIC

102

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SECTORS

AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS PORTFOLIO EXPOSES IT TO A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE UNDERLYING

CREDIT STRENGTH OF THESE SECURITIES.

THE

COMPANY MAKES INVESTMENTS IN RESIDENTIAL COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) THAT TYPICALLY HAVE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY, OFFER GOOD LIQUIDITY AND ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE AN

ADVANTAGE IN YIELD COMPARED TO U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO PURCHASE CMO TRANCHES WHICH OFFER THE MOST FAVORABLE RETURN GIVEN THE RISKS INVOLVED. ONE SIGNIFICANT

RISK EVALUATED IS PREPAYMENT SENSITIVITY. WHILE PREPAYMENT RISK (EITHER SHORTENING OR LENGTHENING OF DURATION) AND ITS EFFECT ON TOTAL RETURN CANNOT BE FULLY CONTROLLED, PARTICULARLY WHEN INTEREST

RATES MOVE DRAMATICALLY, THE INVESTMENT PROCESS GENERALLY FAVORS SECURITIES THAT CONTROL THIS RISK WITHIN EXPECTED INTEREST RATE RANGES. THE COMPANY DOES INVEST IN OTHER TYPES OF CMO TRANCHES IF A

CAREFUL ASSESSMENT INDICATES A FAVORABLE RISK/RETURN TRADEOFF. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PURCHASE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN CMOS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY HELD CMOS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $2.84 BILLION AND $3.59 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY (IN ADDITION

TO THE CMBS SECURITIES OF $766 MILLION AND $935 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DESCRIBED ABOVE). APPROXIMATELY 35% AND 31% OF THE COMPANY'S CMO HOLDINGS ARE GUARANTEED BY OR FULLY COLLATERALIZED

BY SECURITIES ISSUED BY GNMA, FNMA OR FHLMC AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HELD $3.22 BILLION AND $3.52 BILLION OF GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC

(EXCLUDING FHA PROJECT LOANS WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITH CMBS) MORTGAGE-BACKED PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE

AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF ALL OF THE ABOVE SECURITIES WAS "AAA" AT BOTH DATES.

THE

COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 INCLUDED ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES AND

COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS BACKED BY ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION MORTGAGES WITH A COLLECTIVE MARKET VALUE OF $206 MILLION AND $286 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY

0.3% AND 0.4% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, RESPECTIVELY). THE DISRUPTION IN SECONDARY INVESTMENT MARKETS FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES PROVIDED THE COMPANY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY

TO SELECTIVELY ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES AT DISCOUNTED PRICES. THE COMPANY PURCHASED $47 MILLION AND $89 MILLION OF

SUCH SECURITIES IN 2008 AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DEFINES SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AS INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY

EXHIBIT ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: LOW FICO SCORES, ABOVE-PRIME INTEREST RATES, HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS OR HIGH DEBT-TO-INCOME

RATIOS. ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION SECURITIZATIONS ARE THOSE IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT SCORE BUT DO NOT MEET THE

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITY'S GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION, PROPERTY TYPE, DEBT AND LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING ON THESE SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS HELD BY

THE COMPANY WAS "AA2" AND "AAA" AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. APPROXIMATELY $81 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME

AND ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION MORTGAGES WERE DOWNGRADED IN 2008.

THE

COMPANY'S REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE WAREHOUSES AND OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL LAND AND PROPERTIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY OWNED. THE COMPANY'S OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE

PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, MORTGAGE LOANS, VENTURE CAPITAL (THROUGH DIRECT OWNERSHIP AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS)

AND TRADING SECURITIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO MORE VOLATILITY THAN THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. WHILE THESE ASSET CLASSES HAVE HISTORICALLY PROVIDED A HIGHER RETURN THAN FIXED MATURITIES,

IN 2008 THE RETURNS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN PRIOR PERIODS AND, IN THE AGGREGATE, PRODUCED NEGATIVE INVESTMENT INCOME, REFLECTING MARKET CONDITIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER INVESTMENTS WAS $3.04 BILLION AND $3.37 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

103

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THE LENDING OF CERTAIN OF ITS INVESTMENTS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT

PERIODS OF TIME.

BORROWERS OF THESE SECURITIES PROVIDE COLLATERAL EQUAL TO AT LEAST 102% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST. THIS COLLATERAL IS HELD BY A THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN, AND THE

COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE COLLATERAL ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THE INSTITUTION BORROWING THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES IS IN DEFAULT UNDER THE LENDING AGREEMENT. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

RECOGNIZE THE RECEIPT OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN OR THE OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE COLLATERAL. THE LOANED SECURITIES REMAIN A RECORDED ASSET OF THE COMPANY.

DURING

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS SECURITIES LENDING REQUIREMENTS IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT MARKET CONDITIONS TO ACCEPT ONLY CASH AS COLLATERAL FOR SECURITIES ON

LOAN AND RESTRICTED THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT CASH WAS INVESTED. THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES ON LOAN. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD

$8 MILLION OF SECURITIES ON LOAN TO OTHERS, COMPARED WITH $1.99 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCURRED ANY INVESTMENT LOSSES IN ITS SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

THE

NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) THAT WERE INCLUDED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES WERE AS FOLLOWS.

PRETAX UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES TOTALED $253 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, COMPARED WITH NET PRETAX UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OF $938 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE NET UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF RISING INTEREST RATES ON LONGER-DATED FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES (PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS GENERALLY), AS WELL AS NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH REFLECTED CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS.

NET

PRETAX UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 INCREASED BY $258 MILLION OVER YEAR-END 2006, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO. THE

INCREASE IN NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS ON FIXED MATURITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF DECLINING MARKET INTEREST RATES ON BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES, WHICH WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CREDIT SPREADS AND A DECREASE IN UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS IN THE VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY DUE TO SALE ACTIVITIES. IN MAY 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A

BUNDLED SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO, WHICH RESULTED IN THE REALIZATION OF $81 MILLION OF PREVIOUSLY UNREALIZED NET INVESTMENT GAINS.

PURCHASES

AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON CASH REQUIREMENTS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES INVESTMENTS TO

BE SOLD TO ACHIEVE ITS PRIMARY INVESTMENT GOALS OF ASSURING THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET POLICYHOLDER OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS TO OPTIMIZE INVESTMENT RETURNS, GIVEN THESE OBLIGATIONS.

CATASTROPHE MODELING

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ANALYSES AND METHODS, INCLUDING COMPUTER MODELING TECHNIQUES, TO ANALYZE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. THE COMPANY USES THESE ANALYSES AND METHODS TO MAKE UNDERWRITING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS DESIGNED TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS.

IN

MAKING UNDERWRITING AND REINSURANCE DECISIONS, FOR HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE EXPOSURES, THE COMPANY USES THIRD-PARTY PROPRIETARY COMPUTER MODELING IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESTIMATE THE

LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LOSS FROM A SINGLE EVENT OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME WILL EQUAL OR EXCEED A PARTICULAR AMOUNT. THE TABLES BELOW SET FORTH THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITIES THAT LOSSES FROM A

SINGLE EVENT OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME WILL EQUAL OR EXCEED THE INDICATED LOSS AMOUNTS (EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY). FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE BASIS

DESCRIBED BELOW THE TABLES, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THERE IS A ONE PERCENT CHANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S LOSS FROM A SINGLE U.S.

HURRICANE OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME WOULD EQUAL OR EXCEED $1.3 BILLION, OR 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

AN

EVENT THAT HAS, FOR EXAMPLE, A 2% LIKELIHOOD OF EXCEEDANCE IS SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS A "1-IN-50 YEAR EVENT." AS NOTED

ABOVE, HOWEVER, THE PROBABILITIES IN THE TABLE REPRESENT THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSSES FROM A SINGLE EVENT EQUALING OR EXCEEDING THE INDICATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME, NOT OVER A

MULTI-YEAR TIMEFRAME. ALSO, BECAUSE THE PROBABILITIES RELATE TO A SINGLE EVENT, THE PROBABILITIES DO NOT ADDRESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN ONE EVENT OCCURRING IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD,

AND, THEREFORE, THE AMOUNTS DO NOT ADDRESS POTENTIAL AGGREGATE CATASTROPHE LOSSES OCCURRING IN A ONE-YEAR TIMEFRAME.

THE

THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS IN THE TABLES ABOVE ARE NET OF REINSURANCE, AFTER-TAX AND EXCLUDE LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN LESS THAN 10% OF LOSS ESTIMATES. THE

AMOUNTS FOR HURRICANES REFLECT U.S. EXPOSURES AND INCLUDE PROPERTY EXPOSURES, OTHER THAN OFFSHORE ENERGY AND MARINE EXPOSURES, PROPERTY RESIDUAL MARKET EXPOSURES AND AN ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN

NON-PROPERTY EXPOSURES. THE AMOUNTS FOR EARTHQUAKES REFLECT U.S. AND CANADIAN EXPOSURES AND INCLUDE PROPERTY EXPOSURES AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXPOSURES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE

INCLUSION OF HURRICANE OR EARTHQUAKE LOSSES ARISING FROM OTHER GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS OR OTHER EXPOSURES WOULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS. THIS INFORMATION IN THE TABLES IS

BASED ON THE COMPANY'S IN-FORCE PORTFOLIO AND CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE PROGRAM AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

CATASTROPHE

MODELING REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT AND A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS AND RELIES UPON INPUTS BASED ON EXPERIENCE, SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND HISTORY. AS A RESULT, SUCH

MODELS MAY FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR RISKS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF NORMAL PROBABILITY OR THAT ARE OTHERWISE UNFORESEEABLE. CATASTROPHE MODELING ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE PORTION OF

PURCHASED REINSURANCE THAT IS COLLECTIBLE AFTER A CATASTROPHIC EVENT, WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE MATERIALLY INCORRECT. CONSEQUENTLY, CATASTROPHE MODELING ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY.

IN THE TABLES ABOVE, THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNTS INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXCEEDANCE DECREASES. IN OTHER WORDS, IN THE CASE OF A RELATIVELY

MORE REMOTE EVENT (E.G., 1-IN-1000), THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT IS RELATIVELY LESS RELIABLE. ACTUAL LOSSES FROM AN EVENT COULD MATERIALLY EXCEED THE INDICATED THRESHOLD LOSS AMOUNT. IN

ADDITION, MORE THAN ONE SUCH EVENT COULD OCCUR IN ANY PERIOD.

MOREOVER,

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF MATERIAL LOSSES FROM OTHER THAN PROPERTY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION COVERAGES ARISING OUT OF HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, AND IT IS EXPOSED

TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES FROM PERILS OTHER THAN HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, FOR EXAMPLE, FLOODS, TORNADOES AND ACTS OF TERRORISM.

THERE

ARE NO INDUSTRY-STANDARD METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS FOR PROJECTING CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE. ACCORDINGLY, CATASTROPHE ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY DIFFERENT INSURERS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE.

FOR

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, SEE "ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSCATASTROPHE LOSSES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RATINGS, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE."

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES CREDIT RISK, EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO MANDATORY POOLS, AND IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS.

ALTHOUGH THE REINSURER IS LIABLE TO THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF THE REINSURANCE CEDED, THE COMPANY REMAINS LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURER ON ALL RISKS REINSURED. REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE REPORTED

AFTER REDUCTIONS FOR KNOWN INSOLVENCIES AND AFTER ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS COLLATERAL, INCLUDING TRUST AGREEMENTS, ESCROW FUNDS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, UNDER CERTAIN

REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF REINSURERS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND REVIEWS ITS REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS PERIODICALLY. REINSURERS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR

FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS. AFTER REINSURANCE IS PURCHASED, THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED ABILITY TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK TO A REINSURER. IN ADDITION,

IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, A REINSURER IS PERMITTED TO TRANSFER A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT TO ANOTHER REINSURER, WHICH MAY BE LESS

CREDITWORTHY, WITHOUT A COUNTERPARTY'S CONSENT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY AND/OR COURT AUTHORITY.

THE

COMPANY'S REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES TOTALED $14.23 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, A DECLINE OF $1.41 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA, VARIOUS COMMUTATION AGREEMENTS AND COLLECTIONS ON REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS' HURRICANE LOSSES.

THE

COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO MASTER SECURITY AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN REINSURERS. THESE AGREEMENTS DEFINE CONDITIONS THAT REQUIRE THE REINSURER TO PROVIDE COLLATERAL. THE SPECIFIC

CONDITIONS AND THE AMOUNTS AND FORM OF COLLATERAL TO BE PROVIDED BY THESE AGREEMENTS VARY BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE REINSURERS' LEGAL STRUCTURE AND TRADING

HISTORY WITH THE COMPANY. ONE SUCH AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED WITH XL RE AMERICA, A MEMBER OF XL CAPITAL GROUP. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS BENEFICIARY UNDER A TRUST ARRANGEMENT WITH XL RE AMERICA

WHICH PARTIALLY COVERS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES FROM XL RE AMERICA AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

MANY

REINSURANCE COMPANIES AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING UNPRECEDENTED FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION. A NUMBER

OF SUCH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO DOWNGRADES AND/OR NEGATIVE OUTLOOK CHANGES BY VARIOUS RATINGS AGENCIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THESE

FACTORS IN ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF ITS ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS.

OUTLOOK

THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IS TO ENHANCE ITS POSITION AS A CONSISTENTLY PROFITABLE MARKET LEADER AND A COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDER

OF PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN SELECTED INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. A VARIETY OF FACTORS CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET AND THE COMPANY'S CORE

BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR 2009, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS IN THE MARKETS SERVED BY THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS SEGMENTS, LOSS COST TRENDS, INTEREST RATE TRENDS AND THE

INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING DETERIORATING ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS,

INCLUDING UNPRECEDENTED FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION. IF THIS TREND IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUES OR DETERIORATES FURTHER IN 2009, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS MAY DECREASE, AND CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AGENTS, CUSTOMERS, REINSURERS AND THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED. IN ADDITION, IN AN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT, LOSS COSTS MAY INCREASE. SUCH COSTS MAY ALSO INCREASE IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT REPORTING OF CLAIMS, REDUCED

MAINTENANCE OF INSURED PROPERTY OR INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SMALL CLAIMS. MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NEEDING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO THE COMPANY'S STRONG

CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTION MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY GENERALLY, AND THE COMPANY IN PARTICULAR, TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WHEN NEEDED, ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. AS DISCUSSED BELOW, LOSSES ON THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STATUTORY SURPLUS. AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW,

THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD FURTHER IMPACT THE NET INVESTMENT INCOME THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO EARN ON BOTH ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND OTHER INVESTED

ASSETS.

COMPETITION.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE MARKET CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE VERY COMPETITIVE IN 2009, PARTICULARLY

FOR NEW

BUSINESS. IF THE CURRENT DISRUPTION IN THE INSURANCE MARKETPLACE CONTINUES INTO 2009, THERE MAY BE INCREASED OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW BUSINESS, BUT COMPETITION FOR THAT NEW BUSINESS MAY ALSO BE

SIGNIFICANT. FOR EXAMPLE, COMPETITORS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES MAY OFFER PRODUCTS AT PRICES AND ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S

110

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ECONOMIC

STANDARDS IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THEIR BUSINESS. THE PRICING ENVIRONMENT FOR NEW BUSINESS GENERALLY HAS LESS OF AN IMPACT ON UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY THAN RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES,

PARTICULARLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF HIGH RETENTION RATES, WHICH THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE AND THE FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL

INSURANCE SEGMENTS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES IN 2009 TO BE FLAT WITH OR MODESTLY INCREASE OVER THEIR 2008 LEVELS. WITH REGARD TO THE COMPONENTS COMPRISING RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES, THE

POTENTIAL SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN RATES IN 2009 IN SOME PRODUCT LINES IS EXPECTED TO BE LARGELY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN EXPOSURES. IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE SEGMENT IN 2009, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT

AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNERS RENEWAL PRICE CHANGES WILL INCREASE SLIGHTLY OVER THEIR 2008 LEVELS. THESE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE PRICING ENVIRONMENT, WHEN COMBINED WITH EXPECTED MODESTLY INCREASED LOSS

COSTS, WILL LIKELY RESULT IN SOMEWHAT REDUCED UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY.

LOSS COST TRENDS.

LOSS COST TRENDS ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN CLAIM FREQUENCY AND CLAIM SEVERITY. THE INDUSTRY HAS GENERALLY

EXPERIENCED

UNPRECEDENTED LOW LEVELS OF NON-CATASTROPHE-RELATED CLAIM FREQUENCY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THIS LEVEL OF CLAIM FREQUENCY TO CONTINUE IN 2009 IN CERTAIN LINES OF

BUSINESS, WHILE CLAIM

FREQUENCY IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE MODESTLY FOR OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS SEVERITY TO INCREASE MODESTLY FOR NON-CATASTROPHE-RELATED CLAIMS. IN THE BUSINESS INSURANCE

AND FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE SEGMENTS, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED LEVEL OF LARGE, NON WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES DURING 2008. IN THE PERSONAL

INSURANCE SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED LEVEL OF NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER RELATED LOSSES DURING 2008. IF THESE ARE TRENDS THAT CONTINUE IN 2009, THEY COULD

RESULT IN REDUCED UNDERWRITING PROFIT.

THE

OVERALL TREND OF INCREASED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHIC GULF AND ATLANTIC COAST STORMS EXPERIENCED IN RECENT YEARS MAY CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. GIVEN THE

POTENTIAL INCREASE IN FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF STORMS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO REASSESS ITS DEFINITION OF, AND EXPOSURE TO, COASTAL RISKS. THESE RISKS ARE REFLECTED IN THE PRICING AND TERMS AND

CONDITIONS IT WILL OFFER IN COASTAL AREAS. DUE IN PART TO THE INCREASED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF THE GULF AND ATLANTIC COAST STORMS, THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISRUPTION IN THE MARKET FOR COASTAL WIND

INSURANCE, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IN PERSONAL LINES, AS INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, HAVE REDUCED CAPACITY AND INCREASED PRICES. THE CONTINUED DISRUPTION IN MARKET CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH THE POTENTIAL

FOR INCREASED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF COASTAL STORMS, COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF COASTAL WIND COVERAGE THAT THE COMPANY IS ABLE OR WILLING TO WRITE.

IN

RECENT PERIODS, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE IN ALL OF THE COMPANY'S SEGMENTS FOR PRIOR LOSS

YEARS. IF BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE CONTINUES, THE COMPANY MAY RECORD ADDITIONAL NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2009. IN THAT CASE, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO CONCURRENTLY REVISE

FAVORABLY ITS CURRENT YEAR LOSS ESTIMATES. HOWEVER, BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE MAY NOT CONTINUE OR MAY REVERSE, IN WHICH CASE THE COMPANY MAY RECORD NO FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE

DEVELOPMENT OR NET UNFAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN THAT CASE, THE COMPANY MAY REVISE CURRENT YEAR LOSS ESTIMATES UPWARD IN FUTURE PERIODS.

INTEREST RATE TRENDS AND THE INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT.

CHANGES IN THE GENERAL INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AFFECT THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON

NEW

INVESTMENTS. WHILE A RISING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT ENHANCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, THEREBY FAVORABLY IMPACTING NET INVESTMENT INCOME, IT REDUCES THE MARKET VALUE

OF EXISTING FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND THEREFORE, SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES REDUCES THE RETURNS AVAILABLE ON NEW INVESTMENTS, THEREBY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING NET INVESTMENT

INCOME, BUT INCREASES THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING INVESTMENTS AND THEREFORE, SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. IN 2008 AND 2007, SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES DECLINED, REDUCING THE INTEREST INCOME ON

THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2008, CREDIT SPREADS ON OTHER THAN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WHICH REPRESENT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

RISK-FREE YIELD (I.E. THE YIELD ON U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES) AND THE ACTUAL YIELD ON A FIXED-INCOME

111

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENT,

INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS RESULTED IN A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING OTHER THAN SHORT-TERM FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, AND THEREFORE, SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE

COMPANY

HAD A NET PRETAX UNREALIZED LOSS OF $294 MILLION IN ITS FIXED MATURITIES PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, COMPARED WITH A NET PRETAX UNREALIZED GAIN OF $768 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THE

MARKET DISRUPTION THAT OCCURRED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2008 RESULTED IN A LACK OF LIQUIDITY IN CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND A WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS GENERALLY. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES OF $744 MILLION ON SECURITIES FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE WAS LESS THAN 80% OF COST OF THE SECURITY. APPROXIMATELY

$592 MILLION OF THE UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES HAD CONTINUOUSLY BEEN IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION OF GREATER THAN 20% OF COST FOR LESS THAN THREE MONTHS. IF THE MARKET DISRUPTION CONTINUES

AND INTEREST RATES (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS) REMAIN STEADY OR RISE, THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS OF GREATER THAN 20% MAY AGE AND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL UNREALIZED INVESTMENT

LOSSES COULD OCCUR IN THE PORTFOLIO. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REALIZED LOSSES THROUGH SALES OF SECURITIES OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN

2009.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY 5% OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS WERE COMPRISED OF EQUITY SECURITIES, PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, REAL ESTATE

PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, MORTGAGE LOANS, VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND TRADING SECURITIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY THAN FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL MAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF THESE NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND THE REALIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME. FOR

EXAMPLE, REDUCED LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PARTICULARLY INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS

AND HEDGE FUNDS, RESULTING IN A DECLINE IN TRANSACTION VOLUME IN THESE ASSET CLASSES, AND AS A RESULT, LOWER NET INVESTMENT INCOME. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, THESE

NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS COLLECTIVELY PRODUCED NEGATIVE INVESTMENT INCOME. IF THE CURRENT UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT PERSISTS IN 2009, THE COMPANY MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE

NEGATIVE RETURNS FROM THESE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PREDICT FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS OR THEIR IMPACT ON NET INVESTMENT INCOME.

NET

INVESTMENT INCOME IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT TO REMAIN CHALLENGING IN 2009, PARTICULARLY

WITH RESPECT TO ITS NON-FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO MEET THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CASH

REQUIREMENTS OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ASSET MATURITIES AND INCOME RECEIVED ON

INVESTMENTS. CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CATASTROPHE CLAIMS ARE INHERENTLY

UNPREDICTABLE. SUCH CLAIMS INCREASE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE RECOVERIES MAY BE AFFECTED BY REINSURER SOLVENCY AND REINSURANCE COVERAGE DISPUTES. ADDITIONALLY, THE

VARIABILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIM PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS THE VOLATILITY OF POTENTIAL JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS ARISING OUT OF LITIGATION, MAY ALSO RESULT IN INCREASED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. IT IS

THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT THAT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS WILL BE ADEQUATELY MET FROM ALL OF THE ABOVE SOURCES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, TOTAL CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTED ASSETS AND OTHER READILY MARKETABLE SECURITIES AGGREGATING $2.15 BILLION WERE HELD AT THE HOLDING COMPANY.

THE ASSETS HELD AT THE HOLDING COMPANY, COMBINED WITH OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS AVAILABLE, PRIMARILY ADDITIONAL DIVIDENDS FROM OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE HOLDING COMPANY'S CURRENT

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. THESE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND DEBT SERVICE. THE COMPANY'S

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AVAILABLE TO BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF INSURANCE REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES. A MAXIMUM OF $3.07 BILLION IS AVAILABLE IN 2009 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT FOR CONNECTICUT-DOMICILED SUBSIDIARIES AND THE

MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE FOR MINNESOTA-DOMICILED SUBSIDIARIES. THE HOLDING COMPANY RECEIVED $3.70 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS DOMESTIC INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2008. THE COMPANY HAS

A SHELF REGISTRATION WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WHICH PERMITS IT TO ISSUE SECURITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS A $1.0 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT FACILITY WITH SEVERAL MAJOR BANKS THAT

EXPIRES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY REPLACED LEHMAN BROTHERS BANK, FSB'S $60 MILLION PARTICIPATION IN THIS FACILITY THROUGH AN ASSIGNMENT TO

ANOTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THIS LINE OF CREDIT ALSO BACKS UP THE COMPANY'S $800 MILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, OF WHICH $100 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE COMPANY IS NOT RELIANT ON ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM TO MEET ITS OPERATING CASH FLOW NEEDS.

THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY UTILIZES LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED BY MAJOR BANKS TO SUPPORT ITS OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S. AS A RESULT OF MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, ADDITIONAL

CAPITAL, WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PROVIDE BY OBTAINING ADDITIONAL LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED BY MAJOR BANKS, WILL BE REQUIRED IN THE NEAR-TERM TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AT

LLOYD'S. IF LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE PRICE OR AT ALL IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF SUPPORTING ITS OPERATIONS AT LLOYD'S, WHICH COULD

INCLUDE UTILIZING HOLDING COMPANY FUNDS ON HAND.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $3.14 BILLION, $5.29 BILLION AND $4.77 BILLION IN 2008,

2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. CASH FLOWS IN 2008 REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN CLAIM PAYMENTS (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF HIGHER CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND THE $449 MILLION ASBESTOS SETTLEMENT PAYMENT

RELATED TO ACANDS, INC., WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" SECTION HEREIN), AND A REDUCTION IN REINSURANCE RECOVERIES COMPARED WITH 2007. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY MADE A $450 MILLION CONTRIBUTION TO ITS PENSION PLAN IN 2008. NO PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTION WAS MADE IN 2007. CASH FLOWS IN EACH OF 2007 AND 2006, AS COMPARED TO THE PRECEDING YEAR,

REFLECTED HIGHER LEVELS OF COLLECTED PREMIUMS AND NET INVESTMENT INCOME, LOWER CLAIM PAYMENTS ON CATASTROPHE LOSSES, AS WELL AS LOWER RUNOFF CLAIM PAYMENTS. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2007 AND 2006

BENEFITED FROM SIGNIFICANT COLLECTIONS ON REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IN BOTH YEARS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO 2005 HURRICANE LOSSES, OPERATIONS IN RUNOFF (PRIMARILY GULF) AND VARIOUS COMMUTATION

AGREEMENTS. THESE

113

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FACTORS

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN TAX PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM HIGHER PROFITABILITY, EXPENSES RELATED TO INCREASED BUSINESS VOLUME AND CONTINUED EXPENDITURES TO SUPPORT BUSINESS GROWTH

AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND HIGHER INTEREST PAYMENTS.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $162 MILLION, $2.53 BILLION AND $3.06 BILLION IN 2008, 2007

AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF INVESTMENT PURCHASES IN ALL THREE YEARS.

THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED TOTAL INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 DECLINED $4.08 BILLION FROM YEAR-END 2007, REFLECTING THE $2.12 BILLION OF COMMON SHARE

REPURCHASES MADE DURING 2008, A $1.19 BILLION PRETAX DECLINE IN THE UNREALIZED APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS SINCE YEAR-END 2007 (TO AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AT DECEMBER 31,

2008), THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA AND DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INVESTMENT PURCHASES RESULTING FROM STRONG CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. THE NET UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF RISING INTEREST RATES ON LONGER-DATED FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS GENERALLY.

THE

COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT OF THE DURATION OF THE FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO GENERALLY PRODUCES A DURATION THAT EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE COMPANY'S NET INSURANCE

LIABILITIES. THE AVERAGE DURATION OF FIXED MATURITIES AND SHORT-TERM SECURITIES WAS 4.2 AND 4.0 AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

PRIMARY GOALS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS ARE TO SATISFY THE INSURANCE LIABILITIES, MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK EMBEDDED IN THOSE INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND

MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO COVER FLUCTUATIONS IN PROJECTED LIABILITY CASH FLOWS. GENERALLY, THE EXPECTED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO

ADEQUATELY FUND THE ESTIMATED RUNOFF OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EXACT CASH FLOW MATCH IN EACH PERIOD, THE SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE BY WHICH THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FIXED

MATURITY PORTFOLIO EXCEEDS THE EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE OF THE NET INSURANCE LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM NEWLY SOLD POLICIES AND THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID BONDS,

PROVIDE ASSURANCE OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUND THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS WITHOUT HAVING TO SELL ILLIQUID ASSETS OR ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $2.87 BILLION, $2.95 BILLION AND $1.59 BILLION IN 2008, 2007

AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2008 TOTAL PRIMARILY REFLECTED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES, THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT AND DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NET PROCEEDS FROM DEBT ISSUANCES AND

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. THE 2007 AND 2006 TOTALS PRIMARILY REFLECTED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES, THE EARLY REDEMPTION OF DEBT, THE REPAYMENT OF MATURING DEBT AND

DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT AND PROCEEDS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.

DEBT TRANSACTIONS.

2008.

ON MARCH 15, 2008, THE COMPANY'S $400 MILLION, 3.75% SENIOR NOTES MATURED AND WERE FULLY PAID. ON MAY 13, 2008, THE

COMPANY ISSUED $500 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.80% SENIOR NOTES THAT WILL MATURE ON MAY 15, 2018. THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE ISSUANCE, AFTER ORIGINAL ISSUANCE DISCOUNT AND THE

DEDUCTION OF UNDERWRITING EXPENSES AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $496 MILLION. INTEREST ON THE SENIOR NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY ON MAY 15 AND

NOVEMBER 15, COMMENCING NOVEMBER 15, 2008. THE SENIOR NOTES ARE REDEEMABLE IN WHOLE AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO THE

GREATER OF (A) 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED OR (B) THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE

SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED

ON

DECEMBER 15, 2008, TWO MEDIUM-TERM NOTES WITH A CUMULATIVE PAR VALUE OF $149 MILLION, EACH BEARING AN INTEREST RATE OF 6.38%, MATURED AND WERE FULLY PAID.

2007.

IN JANUARY 2007, THE COMPANY REDEEMED $81 MILLION OF 8.47% SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN 1997 AND DUE

JANUARY 10,

2027. THE DEBENTURES WERE REDEEMABLE BY THE COMPANY ON OR AFTER JANUARY 10, 2007. IN JANUARY 1997, USF&G CAPITAL II, A BUSINESS TRUST, ISSUED $100 MILLION OF CAPITAL SECURITIES,

THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH, ALONG WITH $3 MILLION IN CAPITAL PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY, WERE USED TO PURCHASE THE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY USF&G CORPORATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY ASSUMED BY THE

COMPANY AFTER THE MERGER OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES INC. (SPC) AND TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC). DURING THE PERIOD PRIOR TO REDEMPTION, THE COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED AND RETIRED

$22 MILLION OF THE DEBENTURES IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS. UPON THE COMPANY'S REDEMPTION OF THE REMAINING $81 MILLION OF SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES IN JANUARY 2007, USF&G CAPITAL II

IN TURN USED THE PROCEEDS TO REDEEM ITS REMAINING CAPITAL SECURITIES OUTSTANDING. USF&G CAPITAL II WAS THEN LIQUIDATED,

AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED A $3 MILLION DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL. THE COMPANY RECORDED A $3 MILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE REDEMPTION OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES, DUE TO THE REMAINING

UNAMORTIZED FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT RECORDED AT THE MERGER DATE, LESS THE REDEMPTION PREMIUM PAID.

IN

MARCH 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED $1 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.25% FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE MARCH 15,

2067 FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $986 MILLION (AFTER ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT AND THE DEDUCTION OF UNDERWRITING EXPENSES AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES). THE DEBENTURES WERE ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT,

RESULTING IN AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 6.447%. THE DEBENTURES BEAR INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 6.25% FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE TO, BUT EXCLUDING, MARCH 15, 2017, PAYABLE

SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON MARCH 15 AND SEPTEMBER 15. FROM AND INCLUDING MARCH 15, 2017, THE DEBENTURES WILL BEAR INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH

LIBOR PLUS 2.215%, PAYABLE QUARTERLY ON MARCH 15, JUNE 15, SEPTEMBER 15 AND DECEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT, ON ONE OR MORE OCCASIONS, TO DEFER THE

PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE DEBENTURES. THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE DEFERRED INTEREST UNTIL IT HAS DEFERRED INTEREST FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OR, IF EARLIER, MADE A PAYMENT OF CURRENT

INTEREST DURING A DEFERRAL PERIOD. THE COMPANY MAY DEFER INTEREST FOR UP TO TEN CONSECUTIVE YEARS WITHOUT GIVING RISE TO AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. DEFERRED INTEREST WILL ACCUMULATE ADDITIONAL INTEREST AT

AN ANNUAL RATE EQUAL TO THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE THEN APPLICABLE TO THE DEBENTURES.

THE

DEBENTURES CARRY A 60-YEAR FINAL MATURITY AND A SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE IN YEAR THIRTY. DURING THE 180-DAY PERIOD ENDING NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN AND NOT LESS

THAN TEN BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO SELL ENOUGH QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES, OR AT ITS OPTION, COMMON

STOCK, QUALIFYING WARRANTS, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON EQUITY OR DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR PREFERRED EQUITY TO PERMIT REPAYMENT OF THE DEBENTURES AT THE

SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE. IF ANY DEBENTURES REMAIN OUTSTANDING AFTER THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, THE UNPAID AMOUNT WILL REMAIN OUTSTANDING UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS RAISED SUFFICIENT PROCEEDS FROM THE

SALE OF QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES OR, AT ITS OPTION, COMMON STOCK, QUALIFYING WARRANTS, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON EQUITY OR DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR

PREFERRED EQUITY TO PERMIT THE REPAYMENT IN FULL OF THE DEBENTURES. IF THERE ARE REMAINING DEBENTURES AT THE FINAL MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO REDEEM THE DEBENTURES USING ANY SOURCE OF

FUNDS. QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES ARE SECURITIES (OTHER THAN COMMON STOCK, QUALIFYING WARRANTS, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON EQUITY, AND DEBT EXCHANGEABLE

FOR PREFERRED EQUITY) WHICH GENERALLY ARE TREATED BY THE RATINGS AGENCIES AS HAVING SIMILAR EQUITY CONTENT TO THE DEBENTURES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2017 AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT BEING

REDEEMED PLUS ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2017 (A) IN WHOLE AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME OR

(B) IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN TAX OR RATING AGENCY EVENTS RELATING TO THE DEBENTURES, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO THE

GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT BEING REDEEMED AND THE APPLICABLE MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT, IN EACH CASE PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING OF THE DEBENTURES, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A "REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT" FOR THE BENEFIT OF HOLDERS OF ONE OR MORE DESIGNATED SERIES OF THE COMPANY'S

INDEBTEDNESS (WHICH WILL INITIALLY BE THE 6.750% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2036). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT, IF THE COMPANY REDEEMS THE DEBENTURES AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO

MARCH 15, 2047 IT CAN ONLY DO SO WITH THE PROCEEDS OF SECURITIES THAT ARE TREATED BY THE RATING AGENCIES AS HAVING SIMILAR EQUITY CONTENT TO THE DEBENTURES.

IN

MARCH 2007, THE COMPANY'S $500 MILLION, 5.75% SENIOR NOTES MATURED AND WERE FULLY PAID.

IN

APRIL 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE REDEMPTION OF ITS OUTSTANDING $893 MILLION, 4.50% CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE IN 2032 (THE NOTES). THE NOTES WERE ORIGINALLY

ISSUED BY TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP., AND THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES PURSUANT TO A SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE DATED APRIL 1, 2004. EACH NOTE HAD A

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $25.00. THE REDEMPTION PRICE FOR EACH NOTE WAS $25.5625 PLUS $0.009375 OF ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. ANY NOTE CALLED FOR REDEMPTION COULD BE SURRENDERED FOR CONVERSION INTO

COMMON STOCK BEFORE THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 17, 2007. EACH NOTE WAS CONVERTIBLE INTO 0.4684 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. HOLDERS OF $36 MILLION

OF THE NOTES TENDERED THEIR CERTIFICATES IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF 670,910 OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON SHARES. THE REMAINING $857 MILLION OF NOTES WERE REDEEMED FOR CASH, ALONG WITH ACCRUED

INTEREST TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION. THE COMPANY RECORDED A $39 MILLION PRETAX LOSS ($25 MILLION AFTER-TAX) IN OTHER REVENUES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007 RELATED TO THE

REDEMPTION, CONSISTING OF THE REDEMPTION PREMIUM PAID AND THE WRITE-OFF OF REMAINING UNAMORTIZED ISSUANCE COSTS.

IN

MAY 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED $250 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.375% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 15, 2012 (THE 2012 SENIOR NOTES), $450 MILLION AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.750% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 15, 2017 (THE 2017 SENIOR NOTES), AND $800 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.250% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 15, 2037 (THE

2037 SENIOR NOTES). THE TOTAL NET PROCEEDS OF THESE THREE SENIOR NOTE ISSUANCES, AFTER ORIGINAL ISSUANCE DISCOUNTS AND THE DEDUCTION OF UNDERWRITING EXPENSES AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES, WERE

APPROXIMATELY $1.47 BILLION. INTEREST ON EACH OF THE SENIOR NOTE ISSUANCES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY ON JUNE 15 AND DECEMBER 15, COMMENCING DECEMBER 15, 2007.

EACH SERIES OF SENIOR NOTES IS REDEEMABLE IN WHOLE AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF (A) 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED, OR (B) THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED (EXCLUSIVE OF

INTEREST ACCRUED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION) DISCOUNTED TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS (ASSUMING A 360-DAY YEAR CONSISTING OF TWELVE 30-DAY MONTHS)

AT THE THEN CURRENT TREASURY RATE PLUS 12.5 BASIS POINTS FOR THE 2012 SENIOR NOTES, 15 BASIS POINTS FOR THE 2017 SENIOR NOTES AND 20 BASIS POINTS FOR THE 2037 SENIOR NOTES. THE COMPANY APPLIED A

PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF THIS OFFERING TO REPAY APPROXIMATELY $442 MILLION OF SENIOR NOTES MATURING ON AUGUST 16, 2007 AND TO REPAY APPROXIMATELY $42 MILLION OF

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MATURING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007. THE REMAINING PROCEEDS WERE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. PRIOR TO APPLYING THESE PROCEEDS, THE COMPANY INVESTED THEM IN

INVESTMENT GRADE, MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

RESPECTIVELY. NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCES (AFTER ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT AND EXPENSES) TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $786 MILLION, WHICH THE COMPANY APPLIED TO THE REDEMPTION OF APPROXIMATELY

$593 MILLION OF 7.60% SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES (DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW), $150 MILLION OF 6.75% SENIOR NOTES THAT MATURED ON NOVEMBER 15, 2006 AND $56 MILLION OF

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES THAT MATURED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

IN

NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY REDEEMED $593 MILLION OF 7.60% SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN 2001 AND DUE OCTOBER 15, 2050. THE DEBENTURES WERE REDEEMABLE BY

THE COMPANY ON OR AFTER NOVEMBER 13, 2006. IN NOVEMBER 2001, ST. PAUL CAPITAL TRUST I, A BUSINESS TRUST, ISSUED $575 MILLION OF PREFERRED SECURITIES, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH, ALONG

WITH $18 MILLION IN CAPITAL PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY, WERE USED TO PURCHASE THE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY. UPON THE COMPANY'S REDEMPTION OF ITS SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES IN

NOVEMBER 2006, ST. PAUL CAPITAL TRUST I IN TURN USED THE PROCEEDS TO REDEEM ITS PREFERRED SECURITIES. ST. PAUL CAPITAL TRUST I WAS THEN LIQUIDATED, AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN

$18 MILLION DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL. THE COMPANY RECORDED A $42 MILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE REDEMPTION OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES, REPRESENTING THE REMAINING UNAMORTIZED FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT RECORDED AT THE MERGER DATE. A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE JUNE 2006 DEBT ISSUANCES DESCRIBED ABOVE WAS USED TO FUND THIS REDEMPTION.

THE

COMPANY'S DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO OF 19.5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS SLIGHTLY BELOW ITS 20% TARGETED LEVEL.

THE

AMOUNTS OF DEBT OBLIGATIONS, OTHER THAN COMMERCIAL PAPER, THAT BECOMES DUE IN 2009, 2010 AND 2011, ARE $143 MILLION, $273 MILLION AND $11 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

DIVIDENDS.

DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS TOTALED $715 MILLION, $742 MILLION AND $702 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. ON FEBRUARY 4, 2009, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.30 PER SHARE, PAYABLE MARCH 31, 2009 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON MARCH 10,

2009. THE DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS TO HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND UPON MANY FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, EARNINGS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS DEEMS RELEVANT. DIVIDENDS WOULD BE PAID BY THE COMPANY ONLY IF DECLARED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OUT OF FUNDS LEGALLY AVAILABLE, SUBJECT TO ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO

THE COMPANY.

SHARE REPURCHASES.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $5 BILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE OF THE COMPANY'S

COMMON

SHARES. UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION, REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET, PURSUANT TO PRESET TRADING PLANS MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 10B5-1 UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. THE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT HAVE A STATED EXPIRATION DATE. THE TIMING AND ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED IN THE FUTURE

WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CORPORATE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, PRICE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS. SHARE REPURCHASE LEVELS IN PRIOR PERIODS MAY NOT BE

INDICATIVE OF FUTURE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND LIQUIDITY, IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT DISRUPTION IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS LEVEL OF

SHARE REPURCHASES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 COMPARED TO PRIOR QUARTERS AND WILL LIKELY REDUCE ITS SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2009 AS COMPARED TO THE LEVEL OF REPURCHASES IN PRECEDING YEARS, ALTHOUGH THE

COMPANY'S PLANS MAY CHANGE DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, THE COMPANY'S SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE OR OTHER FACTORS. THIS POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN

SECURITIES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS GENERALLY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT

AGREEMENT. ON JUNE 10, 2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $1.0 BILLION, FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. PURSUANT TO

COVENANTS IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN AN EXCESS OF CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OVER GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF NOT LESS THAN $10 BILLION AT ALL TIMES. THE COMPANY

MUST ALSO MAINTAIN A RATIO OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT TO THE SUM OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT PLUS CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH OF NOT GREATER

THAN 0.40 TO 1.00. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS OTHER CUSTOMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO A CHANGE IN CONTROL. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND ALL OTHER COVENANTS RELATED TO ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT

AGREEMENT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

SHELF REGISTRATION.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT FOR THE

POTENTIAL OFFERING AND SALE OF SECURITIES TO REPLACE ITS EXPIRING UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT. THE COMPANY MAY OFFER THESE SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND ON OTHER TERMS TO BE

DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF OFFERING. DURING 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED $500 MILLION AND $2.50 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF DEBT (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) UNDER THE PRIOR SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT.

SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD $3.81 BILLION OF CAPACITY REMAINING UNDER ITS SHARE

REPURCHASE

AUTHORIZATION APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND

ESTIMATED CLAIMS AND CLAIMS RELATED PAYMENTS. THE TABLE EXCLUDES SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS AND INCLUDES ONLY LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED IN CASH.

THE

TABLE BELOW INCLUDES THE AMOUNT AND ESTIMATED FUTURE TIMING OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED PAYMENTS. THE AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE EXACT LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD REPRESENT ESTIMATES,

GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST BASED ON

THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY, FREQUENCY, LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER

FACTORS. VARIABLES IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND

LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. MANY OF THESE ITEMS ARE NOT DIRECTLY QUANTIFIABLE, PARTICULARLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF THE

POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND THE TIME IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER. THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE TABLE BELOW REQUIRED ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT (INCLUDING SEVERITY

CONSIDERATIONS) AND TIMING. AMOUNT AND TIMING ARE FREQUENTLY ESTIMATED SEPARATELY. AN ESTIMATION OF BOTH AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED PAYMENTS IS

GENERALLY RELIABLE ONLY IN THE AGGREGATE WITH SOME UNAVOIDABLE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

IN

ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING, A REINSURANCE AGREEMENT MUST INDEMNIFY THE INSURER FROM INSURANCE RISK, I.E., THE AGREEMENT MUST TRANSFER AMOUNT AND TIMING RISK. SINCE THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH INFLOWS FROM SUCH REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES BY THE INSURER, REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE LIABILITIES (THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES) RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING REINSURED CONTRACTS. THE PRESENCE OF ANY FEATURE

THAT CAN DELAY TIMELY REIMBURSEMENT OF CLAIMS BY A REINSURER RESULTS IN THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DEPOSIT RATHER THAN REINSURANCE. (SEE BELOW.) THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN

ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE USED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE RELATED LIABILITIES.

REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS THAT DO NOT TRANSFER BOTH AMOUNT AND TIMING RISK ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS AND INCLUDED IN "REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS" IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

WORKERS'

COMPENSATION LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES PROVIDE THIRD PARTY COVERAGE IN WHICH THE COMPANY TYPICALLY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE ENTIRE LOSS UNDER

SUCH POLICIES AND THEN SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE INSURED FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. "CLAIMS FROM LARGE DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES" REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENT FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM RELATED

EXPENSES BELOW THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT, NET OF THE ESTIMATED RECOVERY OF THE DEDUCTIBLE. THE LIABILITY AND THE RELATED DEDUCTIBLE RECEIVABLE FOR UNPAID CLAIMS ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AS "CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES" AND "CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES," RESPECTIVELY. MOST DEDUCTIBLES FOR SUCH POLICIES ARE PAID DIRECTLY FROM THE POLICYHOLDER'S ESCROW WHICH IS PERIODICALLY REPLENISHED

BY THE POLICYHOLDER. THE PAYMENT OF THE LOSS AMOUNTS ABOVE THE DEDUCTIBLE ARE REPORTED WITHIN "CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES" IN THE ABOVE TABLE. BECAUSE THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF THE

DEDUCTIBLE (CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES) OCCURS SHORTLY AFTER THE PAYMENT OF THE DEDUCTIBLE TO A CLAIMANT (CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES), THESE CASH FLOWS OFFSET EACH OTHER IN THE TABLE.

DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED IN THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT AND MINNESOTA. THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY

LAWS OF BOTH STATES APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRES NOTICE TO, AND APPROVAL BY, THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DECLARATION OR PAYMENT OF ANY DIVIDEND THAT, TOGETHER WITH

OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF 10% OF THE INSURER'S CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, OR THE INSURER'S NET INCOME FOR THE

TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING THE PRECEDING DECEMBER 31, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND BY STATE REGULATION. THIS DECLARATION OR PAYMENT IS FURTHER

LIMITED BY ADJUSTED UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.

THE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED GENERALLY CONTAIN SIMILAR, ALTHOUGH IN SOME INSTANCES SOMEWHAT MORE RESTRICTIVE,

LIMITATIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. A MAXIMUM OF $3.07 BILLION IS AVAILABLE BY THE END OF 2009 FOR SUCH DIVIDENDS WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE CONNECTICUT INSURANCE DEPARTMENT FOR

CONNECTICUT-DOMICILED SUBSIDIARIES AND THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE FOR MINNESOTA-DOMICILED SUBSIDIARIES. THE HOLDING COMPANY RECEIVED $3.70 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS FROM ITS DOMESTIC

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES IN 2008.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

THE NAIC ADOPTED RBC REQUIREMENTS FOR PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES TO BE USED AS MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THE NAIC AND STATES TO

IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MERIT FURTHER REGULATORY ACTION. THE FORMULAS HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNED TO DIFFERENTIATE AMONG ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITH LEVELS OF CAPITAL HIGHER THAN RBC

REQUIREMENTS. THEREFORE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE TO USE THE FORMULAS TO RATE OR TO RANK THESE COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, ALL OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAD

ADJUSTED CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS REQUIRING ANY COMPANY OR REGULATORY ACTION.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO CERTAIN CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS FOR GUARANTEES RELATED TO LETTERS OF CREDIT, ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES,

CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND VARIOUS INDEMNIFICATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO THE SALE OF BUSINESS ENTITIES. SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT EXPECT THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL POSITION, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES TO BE THOSE APPLIED TO CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND

RELATED REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, INVESTMENT VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENTS, AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES (LOSS RESERVES) REPRESENT MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE UNPAID COSTS OF LOSSES AND

LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED BUT NOT YET REPORTED. LOSS RESERVES DO NOT REPRESENT AN EXACT CALCULATION OF LIABILITY, BUT INSTEAD

REPRESENT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, GENERALLY UTILIZING ACTUARIAL EXPERTISE AND

123

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROJECTION

TECHNIQUES, AT A GIVEN ACCOUNTING DATE. THESE LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS WILL COST UPON FINAL RESOLUTION IN THE

FUTURE, BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEN KNOWN, REVIEW OF HISTORICAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, ESTIMATES OF TRENDS IN CLAIMS SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY, EXPECTED

INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ESTABLISHING LOSS RESERVES, THE COMPANY ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ESTIMATED RECOVERIES, REINSURANCE, SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION. THE

LOSS RESERVES ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY.

THE

PROCESS OF ESTIMATING LOSS RESERVES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE AFFECTED BY BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVENTS,

SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLAIMS HANDLING PROCEDURES, CHANGES IN INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS, ECONOMIC INFLATION, LEGAL TRENDS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AMONG OTHERS. THE IMPACT OF

MANY OF THESE ITEMS ON ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION DIFFICULTIES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO

DIFFERENCES IN CLAIM COMPLEXITY, THE VOLUME OF CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, THE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE DATE FOR A CLAIM AND REPORTING LAGS (THE TIME BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE

OF THE POLICYHOLDER EVENT AND WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY REPORTED TO THE INSURER). INFORMED JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND

EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REFINES ITS LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES IN A REGULAR ONGOING PROCESS AS HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE DEVELOPS AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS

ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED. THE COMPANY RIGOROUSLY ATTEMPTS TO CONSIDER ALL SIGNIFICANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT THE TIME LOSS RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY

UNDERLYING LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT ENVIRONMENT, FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY BE HIGHER

OR LOWER THAN THE RELATED LOSS RESERVES AT THE REPORTING DATE. THEREFORE, ACTUAL PAID LOSSES, AS CLAIMS ARE SETTLED IN THE FUTURE, MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT IN AMOUNT THAN CURRENT LOSS

RESERVESFAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE.

BECAUSE

ESTABLISHMENT OF LOSS RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES, CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED LOSS RESERVES MAY CHANGE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS TO LOSS

RESERVES IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED.

THERE

ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE

INABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND

POLLUTION EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE, INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION, FRAUD, THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND

REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING

PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

A

PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S GROSS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES ARE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION, WHICH TOTALED $3.70 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008. WHILE THE ONGOING REVIEW OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES CONSIDERS THE INCONSISTENCIES OF COURT DECISIONS AS TO COVERAGE, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED

THEORIES OF LIABILITY AND THE RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES

REGARDING THESE CLAIMS COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT DIFFERS FROM CURRENT RESERVES BY AN AMOUNT THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. SEE THE PRECEDING

DISCUSSION OF "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION."

OF 2008, THE COMPANY MADE A $449 MILLION SETTLEMENT PAYMENT RELATED TO ACANDS, INC., FORMERLY A NATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR AND INSTALLER OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS, THAT REDUCED CLAIM AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES. (ALSO, SEE "PART IITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS").

ASBESTOS

AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY, COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER LINES IN THE SUMMARY TABLE. ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES ARE DISCUSSED SEPARATELY; SEE "ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION", "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES."

GENERAL DISCUSSION

THE PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING THE LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM EXPENSES BEGINS WITH THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CLAIM DATA. DATA ON

INDIVIDUAL REPORTED CLAIMS, BOTH CURRENT AND HISTORICAL, INCLUDING PAID AMOUNTS AND INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES, ARE GROUPED BY COMMON CHARACTERISTICS (COMPONENTS) AND EVALUATED BY ACTUARIES

IN THEIR ANALYSES OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES BY PRODUCT LINE. SUCH DATA IS OCCASIONALLY SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXTERNAL DATA AS AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING RESERVES FOR A

COMPONENT IS UNDERTAKEN ON A REGULAR BASIS, GENERALLY QUARTERLY, IN LIGHT OF CONTINUALLY UPDATED INFORMATION.

MULTIPLE

ESTIMATION METHODS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITIES. EACH ESTIMATION METHOD HAS ITS OWN SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES AND ITS OWN ADVANTAGES AND

DISADVANTAGES, WITH NO SINGLE ESTIMATION METHOD BEING BETTER THAN THE OTHERS IN ALL SITUATIONS AND NO ONE SET OF ASSUMPTION VARIABLES BEING MEANINGFUL FOR ALL PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS. THE RELATIVE

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE PARTICULAR ESTIMATION METHODS WHEN APPLIED TO A PARTICULAR GROUP OF CLAIMS CAN ALSO CHANGE OVER

TIME. THEREFORE, THE ACTUAL CHOICE OF ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CAN CHANGE WITH EACH EVALUATION. THE ESTIMATION METHOD(S) CHOSEN ARE THOSE THAT ARE BELIEVED TO PRODUCE THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATION AT THAT

PARTICULAR EVALUATION DATE FOR THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED.

IN

MOST CASES, MULTIPLE ESTIMATION METHODS WILL BE VALID FOR THE PARTICULAR FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CLAIM LIABILITIES BEING EVALUATED. THIS WILL RESULT IN A RANGE OF REASONABLE

ESTIMATES FOR ANY

125

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PARTICULAR

CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY USES SUCH RANGE ANALYSES TO BACK TEST WHETHER PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES FOR RESERVES AT THE REPORTING SEGMENTS ARE REASONABLE, GIVEN SUBSEQUENT

INFORMATION. REPORTED VALUES FOUND TO BE CLOSER TO THE ENDPOINTS OF A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER DETAILED REVIEWS. THESE REVIEWS MAY SUBSTANTIATE THE VALIDITY OF MANAGEMENT'S

RECORDED ESTIMATE OR LEAD TO A CHANGE IN THE REPORTED ESTIMATE.

THE

EXACT BOUNDARY POINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN QUANTITATIVE IN NATURE, AS NO CLEAR LINE OF DEMARCATION EXISTS TO DETERMINE WHEN THE SET OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR

AN ESTIMATION METHOD SWITCHES FROM BEING REASONABLE TO UNREASONABLE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ENDPOINTS OF THESE RANGES ARE OR WOULD BE COMPARABLE ACROSS COMPANIES. IN

ADDITION, POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT ESTIMATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES MAKE THE AGGREGATION OF INDIVIDUAL RANGES A HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL AND INEXACT PROCESS.

PROPERTY

CASUALTY INSURANCE POLICIES ARE EITHER WRITTEN ON A CLAIMS-MADE OR ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. CLAIMS-MADE POLICIES GENERALLY COVER, SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS IN

INDIVIDUAL POLICIES, CLAIMS REPORTED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD. POLICIES THAT ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS REQUIRE THAT THE INSURED DEMONSTRATE THAT A LOSS OCCURRED IN THE POLICY PERIOD, EVEN IF

THE INSURED REPORTS THE LOSS MANY YEARS LATER.

MOST

GENERAL LIABILITY POLICIES ARE WRITTEN ON AN OCCURRENCE BASIS. THESE POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT OVER TIME AS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE IN THE YEARS

FOLLOWING THE POLICY ISSUANCE. THE OCCURRENCE FORM, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, IS ALSO USED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION

GENERAL LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. OCCURRENCE-BASED FORMS OF INSURANCE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PROJECTION OF VARIOUS TRENDS, INCLUDING FUTURE INFLATION AND

JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND SOCIETAL LITIGATION DYNAMICS, AMONG OTHERS.

A

BASIC PREMISE IN MOST ACTUARIAL ANALYSES IS THAT PAST PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED IN THE DATA WILL REPEAT THEMSELVES IN THE FUTURE, ABSENT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS

DISCUSSED BELOW. TO THE EXTENT A MATERIAL CHANGE AFFECTING THE ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY IS KNOWN, SUCH CHANGE IS QUANTIFIED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL COMPANY DATA AND, IF

AVAILABLE AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXTERNAL DATA. SUCH A MEASUREMENT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR CLAIM

PORTFOLIO AND THE KNOWN CHANGE BEING EVALUATED. SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS.

INFORMED

JUDGMENT IS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE RESERVING PROCESS. THIS INCLUDES THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE TO MULTIPLE SETS OF DATA AND ANALYSES. IN

ADDITION TO ACTUARIES, EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE RESERVING PROCESS ALSO INCLUDE UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS PERSONNEL AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT MAY HAVE TO

CONSIDER VARYING INDIVIDUAL VIEWPOINTS AS PART OF ITS ESTIMATION OF LOSS RESERVES. IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE, SUCH AS A MERGER, CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF INFORMED

JUDGMENT BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT.

THE

VARIABLES DISCUSSED ABOVE IN THIS GENERAL DISCUSSION HAVE DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON RESERVE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE CLAIM TAIL, THE

REPORTING LAG, THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CLAIM PROCESS FOR A GIVEN PRODUCT LINE.

PRODUCT

LINES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIABLE AS EITHER LONG TAIL OR SHORT TAIL, BASED ON THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING CLAIMS UNDER A POLICY AND THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THOSE CLAIMS. SHORT TAIL CLAIMS ARE REPORTED AND SETTLED QUICKLY, RESULTING IN LESS ESTIMATION VARIABILITY. THE LONGER THE TIME BEFORE FINAL CLAIM RESOLUTION, THE GREATER THE EXPOSURE TO

ESTIMATION RISKS AND HENCE THE GREATER THE ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

A

MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE CLAIM TAIL IS THE REPORTING LAG. THE REPORTING LAG, WHICH IS THE TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING A CLAIM AND THE REPORTING OF THE CLAIM TO THE INSURER, MAKES

ESTIMATING

126

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IBNR

INHERENTLY MORE UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, THE GREATER THE REPORTING LAG, THE GREATER THE PROPORTION OF IBNR TO THE TOTAL CLAIM LIABILITY FOR THE PRODUCT LINE. WRITING NEW PRODUCTS WITH MATERIAL

REPORTING LAGS CAN RESULT IN ADDING SEVERAL YEARS WORTH OF IBNR CLAIM EXPOSURE BEFORE THE REPORTING LAG EXPOSURE BECOMES CLEARLY OBSERVABLE, THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PRICING AND

RESERVING SUCH PRODUCTS. THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF CLAIM LIABILITIES WITH LONG REPORTING LAGS ARE ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

FOR

SOME LINES, THE IMPACT OF LARGE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS CAN BE MATERIAL TO THE ANALYSIS. THESE LINES ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS BEING "LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY," WHILE LINES WITHOUT

THIS "LARGE CLAIM" SENSITIVITY ARE REFERRED TO AS "HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY." ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH SEVERITY LINES CAN BE SENSITIVE TO THE IMPACT OF A SMALL NUMBER

OF POTENTIALLY LARGE CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE ROLE OF JUDGMENT IS MUCH GREATER FOR THESE RESERVE ESTIMATES. IN CONTRAST, FOR HIGH FREQUENCY/LOW SEVERITY LINES THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS IS

RELATIVELY MINOR AND THE RANGE OF REASONABLE RESERVE ESTIMATES IS NARROWER AND MORE STABLE.

CLAIM

COMPLEXITY CAN ALSO GREATLY AFFECT THE ESTIMATION PROCESS BY IMPACTING THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ESTIMATE, THE POTENTIAL STABILITY OF THE UNDERLYING DATA AND

CLAIM PROCESS, AND THE ABILITY TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA. PRODUCT LINES WITH GREATER CLAIM COMPLEXITY, SUCH AS FOR CERTAIN SURETY AND CONSTRUCTION EXPOSURES, HAVE INHERENTLY GREATER

ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY.

ACTUARIES

HAVE TO EXERCISE A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT IN THE EVALUATION OF ALL THESE FACTORS IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF RESERVES. THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN THE APPLICATION OF ACTUARIAL

JUDGMENT IS UNAVOIDABLE WHEN FACED WITH MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY. DIFFERENT ACTUARIES MAY CHOOSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN FACED WITH SUCH UNCERTAINTY, BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS, PROFESSIONAL

EXPERIENCES AND AREAS OF FOCUS. HENCE, THE ESTIMATES SELECTED BY THE VARIOUS ACTUARIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EACH OTHER.

LASTLY,

SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE AVAILABLE DATA, PRODUCT MIX OR ORGANIZATION CAN ALSO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS. EVENTS SUCH AS MERGERS INCREASE THE

INHERENT UNCERTAINTY OF RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, UNTIL STABLE TRENDS REESTABLISH THEMSELVES WITHIN THE NEW ORGANIZATION.

RISK FACTORS

THE MAJOR CAUSES OF MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY ("RISK FACTORS") GENERALLY WILL VARY FOR EACH PRODUCT LINE, AS WELL AS FOR EACH SEPARATELY

ANALYZED COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT LINE. IN A FEW CASES, SUCH RISK FACTORS ARE EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ESTIMATION METHOD, BUT IN MOST CASES, THEY ARE IMPLICIT. FOR EXAMPLE, A METHOD MAY EXPLICITLY

ASSUME THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS WILL CLOSE EACH YEAR, BUT WILL IMPLICITLY ASSUME THAT THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING CONTRACT LANGUAGE WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED. ACTUAL RESULTS WILL

LIKELY VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS, CAUSING ACTUAL PAID LOSSES, AS CLAIMS ARE SETTLED IN THE FUTURE, TO BE DIFFERENT IN AMOUNT THAN THE RESERVES BEING ESTIMATED CURRENTLY.

SOME

RISK FACTORS WILL AFFECT MORE THAN ONE PRODUCT LINE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CHANGES IN CLAIM DEPARTMENT PRACTICES, CHANGES IN SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS,

COURT ACTIONS, TIMELINESS OF CLAIM REPORTING, STATE MIX OF CLAIMANTS AND DEGREE OF CLAIMANT FRAUD. THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF A RISK FACTOR WILL ALSO VARY BY COMPONENTS WITHIN A PRODUCT LINE.

INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER RISK FACTORS WITHIN PRODUCT LINE COMPONENTS.

THE

EFFECT OF A PARTICULAR RISK FACTOR ON ESTIMATES OF CLAIM LIABILITIES CANNOT BE ISOLATED IN MOST CASES. FOR EXAMPLE, ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL CLAIM SETTLEMENTS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL COURT RULINGS, BUT THE FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TYPICALLY DOES NOT DELINEATE HOW MUCH OF THE SETTLED AMOUNT IS DUE TO THIS AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE

EVALUATION OF DATA IS ALSO SUBJECT TO DISTORTION FROM EXTREME EVENTS OR STRUCTURAL SHIFTS, SOMETIMES IN UNANTICIPATED WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TIMING OF CLAIMS PAYMENTS IN ONE

GEOGRAPHIC REGION WILL BE IMPACTED IF CLAIM ADJUSTERS ARE TEMPORARILY REASSIGNED FROM THAT REGION TO HELP SETTLE CATASTROPHE CLAIMS IN ANOTHER REGION.

127

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE SOME CHANGES IN THE CLAIM ENVIRONMENT ARE SUDDEN IN NATURE (SUCH AS A NEW COURT RULING AFFECTING THE INTERPRETATION OF ALL CONTRACTS IN THAT JURISDICTION),

OTHERS ARE MORE EVOLUTIONARY. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES CAN OCCUR WHEN MULTIPLE FACTORS AFFECT FINAL CLAIM VALUES, WITH THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING EACH FACTOR BEING RESOLVED SEPARATELY, IN STEPWISE

FASHION. THE FINAL IMPACT IS NOT KNOWN UNTIL ALL STEPS HAVE OCCURRED.

SUDDEN

CHANGES GENERALLY CAUSE A ONE-TIME SHIFT IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME LAG IN RELIABLE QUANTIFICATION OF THEIR IMPACT. EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES

GENERALLY CAUSE A SERIES OF SHIFTS IN CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES, AS EACH COMPONENT OF THE EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE BECOMES EVIDENT AND ESTIMABLE.

ACTUARIAL METHODS FOR ANALYZING AND ESTIMATING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

THE PRINCIPAL ESTIMATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES ARE THE PAID DEVELOPMENT METHOD, THE CASE INCURRED

DEVELOPMENT METHOD, THE BORNHUETTER-FERGUSON (BF) METHOD, AND AVERAGE VALUE ANALYSIS COMBINED WITH THE REPORTED CLAIM DEVELOPMENT

METHOD. THE BF METHOD IS USUALLY UTILIZED FOR MORE RECENT ACCIDENT PERIODS, WITH A TRANSITION TO OTHER METHODS AS THE UNDERLYING CLAIM DATA BECOMES MORE VOLUMINOUS AND THEREFORE MORE CREDIBLE. THESE

ARE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS. (SEE GLOSSARY FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THESE METHODS.)

WHILE

THESE ARE THE PRINCIPAL METHODS UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY, ACTUARIES EVALUATING A PARTICULAR COMPONENT FOR A PRODUCT LINE HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM THE FULL RANGE OF METHODS

DEVELOPED WITHIN THE CASUALTY ACTUARIAL PROFESSION. THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES ARE ALSO CONTINUALLY MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE PROFESSION FOR ADVANCES IN EXISTING TECHNIQUES OR THE CREATION OF

NEW TECHNIQUES THAT MIGHT IMPROVE CURRENT AND FUTURE ESTIMATES.

SOME

COMPONENTS OF PRODUCT LINE RESERVES ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RELATIVELY INFREQUENT LARGE CLAIMS THAT CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TOTAL ESTIMATE FOR THAT COMPONENT. IN SUCH CASES, THE

COMPANY'S ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS GENERALLY ISOLATES AND ANALYZES SEPARATELY SUCH LARGE CLAIMS. THE RESERVES EXCLUDING SUCH LARGE CLAIMS ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED USING THE TRADITIONAL METHODS DESCRIBED

ABOVE. THE RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE CLAIMS ARE THEN ANALYZED UTILIZING VARIOUS METHODS, SUCH AS.



ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF LARGE CLAIMS AND THEIR AVERAGE VALUES BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS FROM PRIOR ACCIDENT PERIODS,

ADJUSTED FOR THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH ACTUAL DATA FOR THE ACCIDENT YEAR ANALYZED TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE.



UTILIZING INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES OF THE LARGE CLAIMS, COMBINED WITH CONTINUAL MONITORING OF THE AGGREGATE

ACCURACY OF SUCH CLAIM ADJUSTER ESTIMATES. (THIS MONITORING MAY LEAD TO SUPPLEMENTAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AGGREGATE OF SUCH CLAIM ESTIMATES.)



UTILIZING HISTORIC LONGER-TERM AVERAGE RATIOS OF LARGE CLAIMS TO SMALL CLAIMS, AND APPLYING SUCH RATIOS TO THE

ESTIMATED ULTIMATE SMALL CLAIMS FROM TRADITIONAL ANALYSIS.



GROUND-UP ANALYSIS OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE (TYPICALLY USED FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL).

THE

RESULTS OF SUCH METHODOLOGIES ARE SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS REASONABILITY AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, INCLUDING PAID-TO-INCURRED LOSS RATIOS, IMPLIED

INCURRED-LOSS-TO-EARNED-PREMIUM RATIOS AND NON-ZERO CLAIM SEVERITY TRENDS. AN ACTUAL VERSUS EXPECTED ANALYSIS IS ALSO PERFORMED COMPARING ACTUAL LOSS

DEVELOPMENT TO EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT BASED ON THE PRIOR REVIEW. ADDITIONAL ANALYSES MAY BE PERFORMED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE DIAGNOSTICS, INCLUDING THE INVESTIGATION OF OTHER ACTUARIAL METHODS.

THE

METHODS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT'S EXISTING ESTIMATE FOR PRIOR ACCIDENT PERIODS. FOR THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR, THE

AVAILABLE CLAIM DATA IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE A RELIABLE INDICATION. HENCE, THE INITIAL ESTIMATE FOR AN ACCIDENT YEAR IS GENERALLY BASED ON A LOSS RATIO PROJECTION METHOD, WHICH USES THE

EARNED PREMIUM FOR THE CURRENT YEAR

128

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MULTIPLIED

BY A PROJECTED LOSS RATIO. THE PROJECTED LOSS RATIO IS DETERMINED THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF PRIOR PERIODS' EXPERIENCE, USING LOSS TREND, RATE LEVEL DIFFERENCES, MIX OF BUSINESS CHANGES AND

OTHER KNOWN OR OBSERVED FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR RELATIVE TO PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS. THE EXACT NUMBER OF PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS UTILIZED VARIES BY PRODUCT LINE COMPONENT, BASED ON THE

VOLUME OF BUSINESS FOR THAT COMPONENT AND THE RELIABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT YEAR ESTIMATE.

MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES

AT LEAST ONCE PER QUARTER, CERTAIN COMPANY MANAGEMENT MEETS WITH ITS ACTUARIES TO REVIEW THE LATEST CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVE ANALYSES. BASED ON THESE ANALYSES, MANAGEMENT DETERMINES WHETHER ITS ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CHANGED. IN DOING SO, IT MUST EVALUATE WHETHER THE NEW DATA PROVIDED

REPRESENTS CREDIBLE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION OR AN ANOMALY THAT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ESTIMATED ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, PAYMENTS MAY HAVE DECREASED IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC

REGION DUE TO FEWER CLAIM ADJUSTERS BEING AVAILABLE TO PROCESS CLAIMS. THE RESULTING CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS WOULD BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CHANGE IN PAYMENT PATTERN REPRESENTS A

CHANGE IN ULTIMATE CLAIM LIABILITY.

SUCH

AN ASSESSMENT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT. IT IS FREQUENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CHANGE IN THE DATA IS AN ANOMALY UNTIL SOMETIME AFTER THE EVENT. EVEN IF A CHANGE

IS DETERMINED TO BE PERMANENT, IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE UNTIL SOMETIME LATER. THE OVERALL DETAILED ANALYSES SUPPORTING SUCH AN EFFORT CAN TAKE SEVERAL

MONTHS TO PERFORM. THIS IS BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE TRENDS OBSERVED NEED TO BE EVALUATED, WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE GATHERING OR ASSEMBLING OF DATA NOT PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. IT MAY ALSO

INCLUDE INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS INVOLVED WITH THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES. AS A RESULT, THERE CAN BE A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE EMERGENCE OF A CHANGE AND A DETERMINATION THAT THE CHANGE SHOULD BE REFLECTED

IN THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED CLAIM

LIABILITIES. THE FINAL ESTIMATE SELECTED BY MANAGEMENT IN A REPORTING PERIOD IS BASED ON THESE VARIOUS DETAILED ANALYSES OF PAST DATA, ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ANY NEW ACTIONABLE INFORMATION.

DISCUSSION OF PRODUCT LINES

THE FOLLOWING SECTION DETAILS RESERVING CONSIDERATIONS AND COMMON RISK FACTORS BY PRODUCT LINE. THERE ARE MANY ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS

THAT MAY IMPACT ULTIMATE CLAIM COSTS. EACH RISK FACTOR PRESENTED WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT ON REQUIRED RESERVES. ALSO, RISK FACTORS CAN HAVE OFFSETTING OR COMPOUNDING EFFECTS ON REQUIRED RESERVES.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN WORKERS' COMPENSATION, THE USE OF EXPENSIVE MEDICAL PROCEDURES THAT RESULT IN MEDICAL COST INFLATION MAY ENABLE WORKERS TO RETURN TO WORK FASTER, THEREBY LOWERING INDEMNITY COSTS.

THUS, IN ALMOST ALL CASES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCRETELY MEASURE THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE RISK FACTOR AND CONSTRUCT A MEANINGFUL SENSITIVITY EXPECTATION.

IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON REASONABLY POSSIBLE RESERVING CHANGES BY PRODUCT LINE, THE HISTORICAL CHANGES IN YEAR-END LOSS RESERVES OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD

ARE PROVIDED FOR THE U.S. PRODUCT LINES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR BOTH THE COMPANY AND THE INDUSTRY FOR THE NINE MOST RECENT YEARS, AND IS BASED ON THE MOST RECENT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FOR

THE REPORTED LINE(S) THAT MOST CLOSELY MATCH THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT LINE BEING DISCUSSED. THESE CHANGES WERE CALCULATED, NET OF REINSURANCE, FROM STATUTORY ANNUAL STATEMENT DATA FOUND IN

SCHEDULE P OF THOSE STATEMENTS, AND REPRESENT THE REPORTED RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON THE BEGINNING-OF-THE-YEAR CLAIM LIABILITIES DIVIDED BY THE BEGINNING CLAIM

LIABILITIES, ALL ACCIDENT YEARS COMBINED, EXCLUDING NON-DEFENSE RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE. DATA PRESENTED FOR THE COMPANY INCLUDES HISTORY FOR THE ENTIRE TRAVELERS GROUP (U.S.

COMPANIES ONLY), WHETHER OR NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIARIES WERE ORIGINALLY PART OF SPC OR TPC. THIS TREATMENT IS REQUIRED BY THE STATUTORY REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS PROMULGATED BY STATE REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES FOR SCHEDULE P. COMPARABLE DATA FOR NON-U.S. COMPANIES IS NOT AVAILABLE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GENERAL LIABILITY

GENERAL LIABILITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL LINE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE CLAIMS

FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION AND SPECIFIC POLICY PROVISIONS SUCH AS

SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS

COMPONENTS UNDERLYING THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. SOME OF THESE HAVE RELATIVELY MODERATE PAYMENT PATTERNS (WITH MOST OF THE CLAIMS FOR A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR CLOSED WITHIN 5 TO 7 YEARS),

WHILE OTHERS CAN HAVE EXTREME LAGS IN BOTH REPORTING AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS (E.G., A REPORTING LAG OF A DECADE OR MORE FOR "CONSTRUCTION DEFECT" CLAIMS).

WHILE

THE MAJORITY OF GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES ARE WRITTEN ON AN "OCCURRENCE" BASIS, CERTAIN GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGES (SUCH AS THOSE COVERING DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OR PROFESSIONAL

LIABILITY) ARE TYPICALLY INSURED ON A "CLAIMS-MADE" BASIS.

GENERAL

LIABILITY RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED AS TWO COMPONENTS: PRIMARY AND EXCESS/UMBRELLA, WITH THE PRIMARY COMPONENT GENERALLY ANALYZED SEPARATELY FOR BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY

DAMAGE. BODILY INJURY LIABILITY PAYMENTS REIMBURSE THE CLAIMANT FOR DAMAGES PERTAINING TO PHYSICAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S LEGAL OBLIGATION ARISING FROM NON-INTENTIONAL

ACTS SUCH AS NEGLIGENCE, SUBJECT TO THE INSURANCE POLICY PROVISIONS. IN SOME CASES THE DAMAGES CAN INCLUDE FUTURE WAGE LOSS (WHICH IS A FUNCTION OF FUTURE EARNINGS POWER AND WAGE INFLATION) AND FUTURE

MEDICAL TREATMENT COSTS. PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY PAYMENTS RESULT FROM DAMAGES TO THE CLAIMANT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY ARISING FROM THE POLICYHOLDER'S LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR NON-INTENTIONAL

ACTS. IN MOST CASES, PROPERTY DAMAGE LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF COSTS AS OF THE LOSS DATE, OR SOON THEREAFTER. IN ADDITION, SIZABLE OR UNIQUE EXPOSURES ARE REVIEWED SEPARATELY. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE

ASBESTOS, ENVIRONMENTAL, OTHER MASS TORTS, CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND LARGE UNIQUE ACCOUNTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DISTORT THE ANALYSIS. THESE UNIQUE CATEGORIES OFTEN REQUIRE A VERY

HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND REQUIRE RESERVE ANALYSES THAT DO NOT RELY ON TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS.

DEFENSE

COSTS ARE ALSO A PART OF THE INSURED COSTS COVERED BY LIABILITY POLICIES AND CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, SOMETIMES GREATER THAN THE COST OF THE ACTUAL PAID CLAIMS. FOR SOME PRODUCTS THIS

RISK IS MITIGATED BY POLICY LANGUAGE SUCH THAT THE INSURED PORTION OF DEFENSE COSTS ERODES THE AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT AVAILABLE TO PAY THE CLAIM. SUCH "DEFENSE WITHIN THE LIMITS" POLICIES ARE MOST

COMMON FOR "CLAIMS-MADE" PRODUCTS. WHEN DEFENSE COSTS ARE OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITS, AMOUNTS PAID FOR DEFENSE COSTS DO NOT ERODE THE POLICY LIMITS.

THIS

LINE IS TYPICALLY THE LARGEST SOURCE OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY IN THE UNITED STATES (EXCLUDING ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS COVERING THE SAME RISK). MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO

THIS RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY INCLUDE THE REPORTING LAG (I.E., THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE EVENT TRIGGERING COVERAGE AND THE ACTUAL REPORTING OF THE CLAIM), THE NUMBER OF PARTIES

INVOLVED IN THE UNDERLYING TORT ACTION, WHETHER THE "EVENT" TRIGGERING COVERAGE IS CONFINED TO ONLY ONE TIME PERIOD OR IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE TIME PERIODS, THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED (IN THE

INDIVIDUAL CLAIM ACTIONS), WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND INTENDED TO BE COVERED AT THE TIME THE CONTRACTS WERE WRITTEN (I.E., COVERAGE DISPUTE POTENTIAL), AND THE

POTENTIAL FOR MASS CLAIM ACTIONS. CLAIMS WITH LONGER REPORTING LAGS RESULT IN GREATER INHERENT RISK. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR ALLEGED CLAIMS WITH A LATENCY FEATURE, PARTICULARLY WHERE COURTS HAVE

RULED THAT COVERAGE IS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE POLICY YEARS, HENCE INVOLVING MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS (AND THEIR INSURERS AND REINSURERS) AND MULTIPLE POLICIES (THEREBY INCREASING THE POTENTIAL DOLLARS

INVOLVED AND THE UNDERLYING SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY). CLAIMS WITH LONG LATENCIES ALSO INCREASE THE POTENTIAL RECOGNITION LAG (I.E., THE LAG BETWEEN WRITING A TYPE OF POLICY IN A CERTAIN MARKET

AND THE RECOGNITION THAT SUCH POLICIES HAVE POTENTIAL MASS TORT AND/OR LATENT CLAIM EXPOSURE).

THE

AMOUNT OF RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY ALSO VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY BY COMPONENT FOR THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE. THE COMPONENTS IN THIS PRODUCT LINE WITH THE LONGEST LATENCY,

LONGEST REPORTING LAGS, LARGEST POTENTIAL DOLLARS INVOLVED AND GREATEST CLAIM SETTLEMENT COMPLEXITY ARE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL. COMPONENTS THAT INCLUDE LATENCY, REPORTING LAG AND/OR COMPLEXITY

ISSUES, BUT TO A

130

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MATERIALLY

LESSER EXTENT THAN ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL, INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND OTHER MASS TORT ACTIONS. MANY COMPONENTS OF GENERAL LIABILITY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO MATERIAL

LATENCY OR CLAIM COMPLEXITY RISKS AND HENCE HAVE MATERIALLY LESS UNCERTAINTY THAN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED COMPONENTS. IN GENERAL, POLICIES PROVIDING COVERAGE WITH SHORTER REPORTING LAGS, FEWER

PARTIES INVOLVED IN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS, ONLY ONE POLICY POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED PER CLAIM, FEWER POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOLLARS, REASONABLY FORESEEABLE (AND STABLE) POTENTIAL HAZARDS/CLAIMS AND NO

MASS TORT POTENTIAL RESULT IN MUCH LESS RESERVE ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY THAN POLICIES WITHOUT THOSE CHARACTERISTICS.

IN

ADDITION TO THE TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS MENTIONED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION SECTION, THE COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS REPORT YEAR DEVELOPMENT AND S-CURVE METHODS FOR THE

CONSTRUCTION DEFECT COMPONENTS OF THIS PRODUCT LINE. THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT REPORT YEAR DEVELOPMENT ANALYSIS IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH PROJECTED CLAIM COUNTS AND AVERAGE VALUES FOR IBNR CLAIM COUNTS. FOR

COMPONENTS WITH GREATER LAGS IN CLAIM REPORTING, SUCH AS EXCESS AND UMBRELLA COMPONENTS OF THIS PRODUCT LINE, THE COMPANY RELIES MORE HEAVILY ON THE BF METHOD THAN ON THE PAID AND CASE INCURRED

DEVELOPMENT METHODS.

(EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL), A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.5% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AMOUNTS, OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED

FROM -5% TO 14% (AVERAGING 5%) FOR THE COMPANY AND FROM -3% TO 7% (AVERAGING 2%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN

BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. BECAUSE THE HIGH END OF THE COMPANY'S RANGE OF HISTORICAL ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT COMES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESSES THAT THE COMPANY HAS SINCE EXITED,

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE INDUSTRY'S RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. GENERAL LIABILITY

RESERVES (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL) REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 28% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

131

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE, EXCLUDING ESTIMATED ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AMOUNTS, WAS -5% FOR 2008, -2% FOR 2007 AND +2% FOR

2006. THE 2008 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED SIGNIFICANT FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT, DRIVEN BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK

CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE 2007 CHANGE WAS DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED

LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE 2006 CHANGE LARGELY RESULTED FROM DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND ERRORS AND OMISSIONS

ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO WORSE THAN EXPECTED LARGE LOSS ACTIVITY AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM DETAILED CLAIM REVIEWS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ACCIDENT YEARS 2002 AND 2003.

PROPERTY

PROPERTY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL LINE WITH A SIMPLER AND FASTER CLAIM REPORTING AND ADJUSTMENT PROCESS THAN LIABILITY

COVERAGES, AND LESS UNCERTAINTY IN THE RESERVE SETTING PROCESS (EXCEPT FOR MORE COMPLEX BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS). IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A MODERATE FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY LINE,

EXCEPT FOR CATASTROPHES AND COVERAGE RELATED TO LARGE PROPERTIES. THE CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PROPERTY COVERAGE CLAIM RESERVES IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE

INSURER. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A LOW ESTIMATION RISK, EXCEPT POSSIBLY FOR CATASTROPHES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS.

PROPERTY

RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN TWO COMPONENTS, ONE FOR CATASTROPHIC OR OTHER LARGE SINGLE EVENTS, AND ANOTHER FOR ALL OTHER EVENTS. EXAMPLES OF COMMON RISK FACTORS, OR

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -34% TO 26% (AVERAGING -6%)

FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM -14% TO 7% (AVERAGING -2%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON,

OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. BECAUSE THE HIGH END OF THE COMPANY'S RANGE OF HISTORICAL ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT COMES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESSES THAT THE COMPANY HAS SINCE EXITED, THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT THE INDUSTRY'S RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR

132

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES

IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. PROPERTY RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 4% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

WHILE

PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE, THE ONE YEAR CHANGE FOR PROPERTY CAN BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THAT FOR THE LONGER TAIL PRODUCT LINES. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE

MAJORITY OF THE RESERVE FOR PROPERTY RELATES TO THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE MOST UNCERTAINTY FOR ALL PRODUCT LINES. THIS RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR UNCERTAINTY IS RELEVANT TO

PROPERTY BECAUSE OF WEATHER RELATED EVENTS WHICH TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, AND GENERALLY ARE NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. RESERVE ESTIMATES

ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CATASTROPHES MAY TAKE EVEN LONGER TO RESOLVE. THE RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE ARE ALSO POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO MATERIAL CHANGES DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN MEASURING

ULTIMATE LOSSES FOR UNPRECEDENTED SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 AND HURRICANE KATRINA.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -22% FOR 2008, -18% FOR 2007 AND -11% FOR 2006. THE 2008 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 2007 ACCIDENT YEAR FOR CERTAIN LARGE PROPERTY, OCEAN MARINE AND INLAND MARINE CLAIM EXPOSURES, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO, AND

ONGOING CLAIM SETTLEMENTS FOR, HURRICANE KATRINA. THE 2007 CHANGE WAS DUE TO FEWER THAN EXPECTED LATE REPORTED CLAIMS RELATED TO NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER EVENTS THAT OCCURRED LATE IN 2006

AS WELL AS BETTER THAN EXPECTED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY DUE IN PART TO CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, SUCH AS HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER POLICY LIMITS. IN ADDITION, THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE EXPERIENCED

BETTER THAN EXPECTED LARGE LOSS OUTCOMES WHICH WERE PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAVORABLE LITIGATION RESOLUTIONS. THE 2006 CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTED LESS "DEMAND SURGE" INFLATION THAN ORIGINALLY

ESTIMATED FOR 2005 ACCIDENT YEAR NON-CATASTROPHE AND CATASTROPHE LOSSES.

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL

COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL PROVIDES A COMBINATION OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND, THEREFORE,

INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. FOR

PROPERTY COVERAGE, IT GENERALLY TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE CLAIMS, WHILE FOR THE OTHER COVERAGES, GENERALLY FOR THE LIABILITY COVERAGES, IT TAKES A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO CLOSE

CLAIMS.

THE

RESERVING RISK FOR THIS LINE IS DOMINATED BY THE LIABILITY COVERAGE PORTION OF THIS PRODUCT, EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY IN THE EVENT OF CATASTROPHIC OR LARGE SINGLE LOSSES. THE RESERVING

RISK FOR THIS LINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE GENERAL LIABILITY PRODUCT LINE AND THE PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CUSTOMER. COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL IS GENERALLY SOLD TO SMALLER-SIZED

ACCOUNTS, WHILE THE CUSTOMER PROFILE FOR GENERAL LIABILITY AND PROPERTY INCLUDES LARGER CUSTOMERS.

SEE

"PROPERTY RISK FACTORS" AND "GENERAL LIABILITY RISK FACTORS," DISCUSSED ABOVE, WITH REGARD TO RESERVING RISK FOR COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL.

UNANTICIPATED

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL), A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.2% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS

RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -16% TO 2% (AVERAGING -5%)

FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM -3% TO 6% (AVERAGING 2%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS

DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL RESERVES (EXCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES) REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THIS LINE COMBINES GENERAL LIABILITY AND PROPERTY COVERAGES AND IT HAS BEEN IMPACTED IN THE PAST BY MANY OF THE SAME EVENTS AS THOSE TWO LINES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -16% FOR 2008, -8% FOR 2007 AND -4% FOR 2006. THE 2008 CHANGE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AND ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE CHANGE WAS IMPROVEMENT IN THE

LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO, AND ONGOING CLAIM SETTLEMENTS FOR, HURRICANE KATRINA. THE 2007 AND 2006 CHANGES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

INCREASINGLY

FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES.

COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE

THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINE IS A MIX OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITY COVERAGES AND, THEREFORE, INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL

COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE

DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. IN GENERAL, CLAIM REPORTING LAGS ARE MINOR, CLAIM COMPLEXITY IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE, AND THE LINE IS VIEWED AS HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE

SEVERITY. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

COMMERCIAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN FOUR COMPONENTS: BODILY INJURY LIABILITY; PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY; COLLISION CLAIMS; AND COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS. THESE LAST TWO

COMPONENTS HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT PRESENTED.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES THE TRADITIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS MENTIONED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOVE IN ESTIMATING CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE. THIS IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH DETAILED CUSTOM

ANALYSES WHERE NEEDED.

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES

FOR COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.2% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -10% TO 9% (AVERAGING -1%)

FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM -3% TO 9% (AVERAGING 2%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS

DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. COMMERCIAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -7% FOR 2008, -10% FOR 2007 AND -7% FOR 2006. THE 2008 CHANGE WAS A RESULT OF

BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2007, WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AND ENHANCED RISK

CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE 2007 CHANGE WAS DUE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT, FOR RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS, AS A RESULT OF MORE FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL

ENVIRONMENTS, CLAIM HANDLING INITIATIVES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN AUTO SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. THE 2006 CHANGE WAS DUE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY FOR ACCIDENT YEARS 2003 THROUGH 2005,

WHICH WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAVORABLE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, CLAIM HANDLING INITIATIVES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN AUTO SAFETY TECHNOLOGY.

WORKERS' COMPENSATION

WORKERS' COMPENSATION IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A LONG TAIL COVERAGE, AS IT TAKES A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE CLAIMS

FROM A GIVEN ACCIDENT YEAR. WHILE CERTAIN PAYMENTS SUCH AS INITIAL MEDICAL TREATMENT OR TEMPORARY WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR THE INJURED WORKER ARE MADE QUICKLY, SOME OTHER PAYMENTS ARE MADE OVER THE COURSE

OF SEVERAL YEARS, SUCH AS AWARDS FOR PERMANENT PARTIAL INJURIES. IN ADDITION, SOME PAYMENTS CAN RUN AS LONG AS THE INJURED WORKER'S LIFE, SUCH AS PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS AND ON-GOING

MEDICAL CARE. DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY OF LONG PAYMENT TAILS, THE REPORTING LAGS ARE GENERALLY SHORT, SETTLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT COMPLEX, AND MOST OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE CONSIDERED HIGH FREQUENCY

WITH MODERATE SEVERITY. THE LARGEST RESERVE RISK GENERALLY COMES FROM THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY CLAIMS PROVIDING LIFETIME COVERAGE FOR MEDICAL EXPENSE ARISING FROM A WORKER'S INJURY. OVERALL,

THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A SOMEWHAT GREATER THAN MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

WORKERS'

COMPENSATION RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN THREE COMPONENTS: INDEMNITY LOSSES, MEDICAL LOSSES AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.

EXAMPLES

OF COMMON RISK FACTORS, OR PERCEPTIONS THEREOF, THAT COULD CHANGE AND, THUS, AFFECT THE REQUIRED WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESERVES (BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION

CHANGES IN RISK FACTORS CAN AFFECT RESERVES. AS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAUSAL EFFECT THAT A CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE ON RESERVES FOR WORKERS'

COMPENSATION, A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.3% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -2% TO 2% (AVERAGING 0%) FOR THE COMPANY,

AND FROM -1% TO 4% (AVERAGING 1%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESERVES

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS 1% FOR 2008, AND 0% FOR 2007 AND 2006. THE 2008 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED MEDICAL COSTS

RELATED TO CLAIMS FROM OLDER ACCIDENT YEARS.

FIDELITY AND SURETY

FIDELITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. IT TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO FINALIZE AND SETTLE FIDELITY

CLAIMS. THE VOLATILITY OF FIDELITY RESERVES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE TYPE OF BUSINESS OF THE INSURED, THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE INSURED'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AMOUNT OF POLICY LIMIT AND

ATTACHMENT POINT OF COVERAGE. THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING RESERVES FOR SMALL, COMMERCIAL INSUREDS IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN THE UNCERTAINTY FOR LARGE COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE HIGH

FREQUENCY, LOW SEVERITY NATURE OF SMALL COMMERCIAL FIDELITY LOSSES PROVIDES FOR STABILITY IN LOSS ESTIMATES WHEREAS, THE LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY NATURE OF LOSSES FOR LARGE INSUREDS RESULTS IN A

WIDER RANGE OF ULTIMATE LOSS OUTCOMES. ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES THAT RELY ON A STABLE PATTERN OF LOSS DEVELOPMENT ARE GENERALLY NOT APPLICABLE TO LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH SEVERITY POLICIES.

SURETY

HAS CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED SHORT TAIL COVERAGES WITH SHORT REPORTING LAGS, ALTHOUGH LARGE INDIVIDUAL CONSTRUCTION AND COMMERCIAL SURETY CONTRACTS CAN

RESULT IN A LONG SETTLEMENT TAIL, BASED ON THE LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OR COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION BEING INSURED. (LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS CAN TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE.)

THE

136

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FREQUENCY

OF LOSSES IN SURETY CORRELATES WITH ECONOMIC CYCLES AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF SURETY LOSS IS THE INABILITY TO PERFORM FINANCIALLY. THE VOLATILITY OF SURETY LOSSES IS GENERALLY RELATED TO THE

TYPE OF BUSINESS PERFORMED BY THE INSURED, THE TYPE OF BONDED OBLIGATION, THE AMOUNT OF LIMIT EXPOSED TO LOSS AND THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS AVAILABLE TO THE INSURER TO MITIGATE LOSSES, SUCH AS UNBILLED

CONTRACT FUNDS, COLLATERAL, FIRST AND THIRD PARTY INDEMNITY, AND OTHER SECURITY POSITIONS OF AN INSURED'S ASSETS. CERTAIN CLASSES OF SURETY CLAIMS ARE VERY HIGH SEVERITY, LOW FREQUENCY IN NATURE.

THESE CAN INCLUDE LARGE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS INVOLVED WITH ONE OR MULTIPLE LARGE, COMPLEX PROJECTS AS WELL AS CERTAIN LARGE COMMERCIAL SURETY EXPOSURES. OTHER CLAIM FACTORS AFFECTING RESERVE

VARIABILITY OF SURETY INCLUDE LITIGATION RELATED TO AMOUNTS OWED BY AND DUE THE INSURED (E.G., SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION EFFORTS) AND THE RESULTS OF FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF AN INSURED.

EXAMPLES

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -10% TO 138% (AVERAGING 21%) FOR THE

COMPANY, AND FROM -11% TO 24% (AVERAGING 6%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED EVENTS DURING

THE YEAR. BECAUSE THE HIGH END OF THE COMPANY'S RANGE WAS DUE TO ACQUIRED BUSINESS IN 2004, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE INDUSTRY'S RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE

ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE. FIDELITY AND SURETY RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

IN

GENERAL, DEVELOPMENTS ON SINGLE LARGE CLAIMS (BOTH ADVERSE AND FAVORABLE) ARE A PRIMARY SOURCE OF CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE.

137

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -10% FOR 2008, -1% FOR 2007 AND -5% FOR 2006. THE 2008 CHANGE WAS A RESULT OF

BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR THE CONTRACT SURETY BUSINESS WITHIN THIS PRODUCT LINE, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS ON LARGE CLAIMS FROM OLDER ACCIDENT YEARS. THE 2006 CHANGE WAS

DUE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED LARGE LOSS ACTIVITY.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INCLUDES BOTH SHORT AND LONG TAIL COVERAGES. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO AUTO PHYSICAL

DAMAGE (PROPERTY) CLAIMS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE (LIABILITY) CLAIMS. THE PAYMENTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO FINALIZE AND ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE RELATE TO BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. REPORTING LAGS ARE

RELATIVELY SHORT AND THE CLAIM SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY GENERALLY IS THE LEAST COMPLEX OF THE LIABILITY PRODUCTS. IT IS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO

MODERATE SEVERITY PRODUCT LINE. OVERALL, THE CLAIM LIABILITIES FOR THIS LINE CREATE A MODERATE ESTIMATION RISK.

PERSONAL

AUTOMOBILE RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN FIVE COMPONENTS: BODILY INJURY LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY, NO-FAULT LOSSES, COLLISION CLAIMS AND

COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS. THESE LAST TWO COMPONENTS HAVE MINIMUM RESERVE RISK AND FAST PAYOUTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SEPARATE FACTORS ARE NOT PRESENTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -9% TO 1% (AVERAGING -4%) FOR

THE COMPANY, AND FROM -4% TO 0% (AVERAGING -2%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON, OBSERVED

EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE.

PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 5% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -1% FOR 2008, -5% FOR 2007 AND -7% FOR 2006. THE DECREASES IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006

WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES AS WELL AS INITIATIVES TO FIGHT FRAUD.

HOMEOWNERS AND PERSONAL LINES OTHER

HOMEOWNERS IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE. MOST PAYMENTS ARE RELATED TO THE PROPERTY PORTION OF THE POLICY, WHERE THE

CLAIM REPORTING AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO THE INSURED AND THE INSURER. CLAIMS ON PROPERTY COVERAGE ARE TYPICALLY REPORTED SOON AFTER THE ACTUAL DAMAGE OCCURS, ALTHOUGH DELAYS

OF SEVERAL MONTHS ARE NOT UNUSUAL. THE CLAIM IS SETTLED WHEN THE TWO PARTIES AGREE ON THE AMOUNT DUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICY CONTRACT LANGUAGE AND THE APPROPRIATE PAYMENT IS MADE (OR

ALTERNATIVELY, THE PROPERTY REPLACEMENT/REPAIR IS PERFORMED BY THE INSURER). THE RESULTING SETTLEMENT PROCESS IS TYPICALLY FAIRLY SHORT TERM, ALTHOUGH EXCEPTIONS DO EXIST.

THE

LIABILITY PORTION OF THE HOMEOWNERS POLICY GENERATES CLAIMS WHICH TAKE LONGER TO PAY DUE TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF LITIGATION AND NEGOTIATION, BUT WITH GENERALLY SMALL REPORTING LAGS. IN

ADDITION, RESERVES RELATED TO UMBRELLA COVERAGES HAVE GREATER UNCERTAINTY SINCE UMBRELLA LIABILITY PAYMENTS ARE OFTEN MADE FAR INTO THE FUTURE.

OVERALL,

THE LINE IS GENERALLY HIGH FREQUENCY, LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY (EXCEPT FOR CATASTROPHES), WITH SIMPLE TO MODERATE CLAIM COMPLEXITY.

HOMEOWNERS

RESERVES ARE TYPICALLY ANALYZED IN TWO COMPONENTS: NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED LOSSES AND CATASTROPHE LOSS PAYMENTS.

PERSONAL LINES OTHER, A 1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN INCREMENTAL PAID LOSS DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR COULD RESULT IN A 1.1% INCREASE (DECREASE) IN LOSS RESERVES.

HISTORICALLY,

THE ONE-YEAR CHANGE IN THE RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAS VARIED FROM -31% TO 3% (AVERAGING -11%)

FOR THE COMPANY, AND FROM -8% TO 11% (AVERAGING -2%) FOR THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. THE COMPANY'S YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY, AND ARE BASED ON,

OBSERVED EVENTS DURING THE YEAR. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS RANGE OF HISTORICAL OUTCOMES IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ONE-YEAR CHANGES IN RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR THIS PRODUCT

LINE. HOMEOWNERS AND PERSONAL LINES OTHER RESERVES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LOSS RESERVES.

THIS

LINE COMBINES BOTH LIABILITY AND PROPERTY COVERAGES; HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVES RELATE TO PROPERTY. WHILE PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED A SHORT TAIL COVERAGE, THE ONE YEAR

CHANGE FOR PROPERTY CAN BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THAT FOR THE LONGER TAIL PRODUCT LINES. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE RESERVE FOR PROPERTY RELATES TO THE MOST RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR,

WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE MOST UNCERTAINTY FOR ALL PRODUCT LINES. THIS RECENT ACCIDENT YEAR UNCERTAINTY IS RELEVANT TO PROPERTY BECAUSE OF WEATHER RELATED EVENTS WHICH TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE

SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, AND GENERALLY ARE NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. RESERVE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CATASTROPHES MAY TAKE EVEN LONGER TO RESOLVE.

THE

COMPANY'S CHANGE IN RESERVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE WAS -13% FOR 2008, -3% FOR 2007 AND -22% FOR 2006. THE 2008 CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN

BY FAVORABLE LOSS EXPERIENCE RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA, BY CLAIM INITIATIVES, BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED OUTCOMES ON 2007 CATASTROPHE-RELATED CLAIMS AND BY IMPROVEMENTS IN OLDER ACCIDENT YEARS FOR THE

UMBRELLA LINE. THE 2007 CHANGE WAS DUE TO FEWER THAN EXPECTED LATE REPORTED CLAIMS RELATED TO NON-CATASTROPHE WEATHER EVENTS THAT OCCURRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006. IN ADDITION, A

PORTION OF THE CHANGE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND FEWER SMALL-DOLLAR CLAIMS. THE 2006 CHANGE WAS DUE TO

LOWER THAN EXPECTED ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA AS WELL AS BETTER THAN EXPECTED NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY, DUE IN PART TO CHANGES IN THE

MARKETPLACE, SUCH AS HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND FEWER SMALL-DOLLAR CLAIMS, AND CONTINUED EVIDENCE OF A LESS THAN EXPECTED IMPACT FROM DEMAND SURGE.

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER

INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER INCLUDES PRODUCTS WRITTEN BY INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER PRODUCTS NOT DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF

"OTHER" CLAIM RESERVES IS ASSUMED REINSURANCE WRITTEN ON AN EXCESS-OF-LOSS BASIS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE REINSURANCE OF NON-U.S. EXPOSURES, AND IS RUNOFF BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL

AND OTHER CLAIM LIABILITIES RESULT FROM A MIX OF COVERAGES, CURRENCIES AND JURISDICTIONS/COUNTRIES. THE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC IS THE NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE ANALYSIS TO THE

INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT, AND THE INABILITY TO RELY ON DATA CHARACTERIZATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. STATUTORY REPORTING FRAMEWORK.

DUE

TO CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS MIX FOR THIS LINE OVER TIME, THE RECENTLY INCURRED CLAIM LIABILITIES ARE RELATIVELY SHORT TERM (DUE TO BOTH THE PRODUCTS AND THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED,

E.G., THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM), WHILE THE OLDER LIABILITIES INCLUDE SOME FROM RUNOFF OPERATIONS THAT

140

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE

EXTREMELY LONG TAIL (E.G., U.S. EXCESS LIABILITIES REINSURED THROUGH THE LONDON MARKET, AND SEVERAL UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF). THE SPEED OF CLAIM REPORTING AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT IS A

FUNCTION OF THE SPECIFIC COVERAGE PROVIDED, THE JURISDICTION, THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (E.G., UNDERWRITING POOL VERSUS DIRECT) AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE INSURANCE SALE TO THE INSURED HAZARD

(E.G., INSURED AND INSURER LOCATED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES). IN PARTICULAR, LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE UNDERWRITING POOLS IN RUNOFF MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REPORTING LAGS, SETTLEMENT LAGS

AND CLAIM COMPLEXITY, DUE TO THE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER POOL MEMBERS OR CO-INSURERS THROUGH A BROKER OR LEAD-INSURER FOR CLAIM SETTLEMENT PURPOSES.

INTERNATIONAL

AND OTHER RESERVES ARE GENERALLY ANALYZED BY PROGRAM/POOL, COUNTRY AND GENERAL COVERAGE CATEGORY (E.G., U.S. LIABILITYEXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE, OR

GENERAL LIABILITYMUNICIPALITIESBY COUNTRY). THE BUSINESS IS ALSO GENERALLY SPLIT BY DIRECT VERSUS ASSUMED REINSURANCE FOR A GIVEN COVERAGE/JURISDICTION. WHERE THE UNDERLYING

INSURED HAZARD IS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE UNDERLYING COVERAGES ARE GENERALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND AUTOMOBILE DISCUSSION ABOVE, BUT UNDER A DIFFERENT LEGAL

SYSTEM. WHERE THE UNDERLYING HAZARD IS WITHIN THE U.S., THE COVERAGE INVOLVED IS TYPICALLY THAT OF GENERAL LIABILITY, BUT ON AN EXCESS OR EXCESS-OF-LOSS REINSURANCE BASIS.

EXCESS EXPOSURE REQUIRES THE INSURED TO "PROVE" NOT ONLY CLAIMS UNDER THE POLICY, BUT ALSO THE PRIOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS REACHING UP TO THE EXCESS POLICY'S ATTACHMENT POINT.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND

MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY BECOMES INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO

DETERMINE THE COMPANY'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS AND

DISPUTES.

THE

COMPANY REPORTS ITS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ONGOING REVIEW OF

AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES. FROM TIME TO TIME, AS A RESULT OF THE

LONG-TAILED NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING LIABILITIES, COVERAGE COMPLEXITIES AND POTENTIAL FOR DISPUTES, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE COMMUTATION OF REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED REINSURANCE

RECOVERABLES AND COMMUTATION ACTIVITY COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES. TOTAL REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 DECLINED BY $1.41 BILLION FROM THE SAME

DATE IN 2007, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA, VARIOUS COMMUTATION AGREEMENTS AND COLLECTIONS ON REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO PRIOR YEAR HURRICANE LOSSES. THE

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 DECLINED BY $70 MILLION FROM THE SAME DATE IN 2007, GENERALLY DUE TO SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY AND COMMUTATIONS.

RECOVERABLES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS RELATE PRIMARILY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION, FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY HAS PURCHASED ANNUITIES AND REMAINS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY THE COMPANIES ISSUING THE ANNUITIES. RECOVERABLES ATTRIBUTABLE TO MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS RELATE

PRIMARILY TO WORKERS' COMPENSATION SERVICE BUSINESS AND HAVE THE OBLIGATION OF THE PARTICIPATING INSURANCE COMPANIES ON A JOINT AND SEVERAL BASIS SUPPORTING THESE CESSIONS.

INVESTMENT VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENTS

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN

FASB STATEMENT NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(FAS 157). THE FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON THE INPUTS USED IN VALUATION AND GIVES THE

HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND REQUIRES THAT OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED IN THE VALUATIONS WHEN AVAILABLE. THE DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN THE FAS 157 HIERARCHY

IS BASED ON WHETHER THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS INTO THE

142

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VALUATION

ARE OBSERVABLE. IN DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY IN WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS DISCLOSED, THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND THE LOWEST

PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT MARKET ASSUMPTIONS. THE THREE LEVELS OF THE HIERARCHY ARE AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1UNADJUSTED

QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY

TO ACCESS.



LEVEL 2QUOTED

PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS; OR VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE (E.G., INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULT RATES, LOSS

SEVERITIES, ETC.) OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.



LEVEL 3VALUATIONS

BASED ON MODELS WHERE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT THE COMPANY'S

OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE INPUTS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE, UNRELATED WILLING PARTIES, I.E., NOT IN A FORCED TRANSACTION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MAY DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED IF THE

SECURITY WAS SOLD IN AN IMMEDIATE SALE, E.G., A FORCED TRANSACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUATION OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE LESS LIQUID DUE TO THE LACK OF MARKET

BASED INPUTS, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (I.E., THE CARRYING AMOUNT) OF AN INVESTMENT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE PRICE AT WHICH AN ACTUAL TRANSACTION WOULD

OCCUR.

FOR

INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, THE COMPANY USES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDES THESE PRICES IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN

LEVEL 1 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES FROM A THIRD PARTY, NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICE (PRICING SERVICE). WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE UNAVAILABLE,

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS MAINLY FOR ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES PROVIDED FROM THIS PRICING SERVICE ARE

INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND AN ESTIMATE FROM A PRICING SERVICE ARE UNAVAILABLE, THE COMPANY PRODUCES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE

BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, WILL RENDER THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE AS LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3. THE COMPANY

BASES ALL OF ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR ASSETS ON THE BID PRICE AS IT REPRESENTS WHAT A THIRD PARTY MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY IN AN ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION.

FIXED MATURITIES

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 99% OF ITS FIXED MATURITIES. THE PRICING

SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. SINCE FIXED MATURITIES OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES GENERALLY DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY

BASIS, THE PRICING SERVICE PREPARES ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR THESE SECURITIES USING ITS PROPRIETARY PRICING APPLICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE AVAILABLE RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, BENCHMARK

CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR GROUPINGS, AND MATRIX PRICING. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRICING SERVICE USES AN OPTION ADJUSTED SPREAD MODEL TO DEVELOP PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS.

THE

PRICING SERVICE EVALUATES EACH ASSET CLASS BASED ON RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, RELEVANT CREDIT INFORMATION, PERCEIVED MARKET MOVEMENTS AND SECTOR NEWS. THE MARKET INPUTS UTILIZED

IN THE PRICING

EVALUATION,

LISTED IN THE APPROXIMATE ORDER OF PRIORITY, INCLUDE: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES, BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, TWO-SIDED MARKETS, BENCHMARK SECURITIES, BIDS,

OFFERS, REFERENCE DATA, AND INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. THE EXTENT OF THE USE OF EACH MARKET INPUT DEPENDS ON THE ASSET CLASS AND THE MARKET CONDITIONS. DEPENDING ON THE SECURITY, THE PRIORITY OF

THE USE OF INPUTS MAY CHANGE OR SOME MARKET INPUTS MAY NOT BE RELEVANT. FOR SOME SECURITIES ADDITIONAL INPUTS MAY BE NECESSARY.

THE

PRICING SERVICE UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED THAT THEY WILL ONLY PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IF THERE IS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE INFORMATION TO PRODUCE A VALUATION. IF

THE PRICING SERVICE DISCONTINUES PRICING AN INVESTMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE USING SOME OF THE SAME METHODOLOGIES AS THE PRICING SERVICE, BUT WOULD HAVE

TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS FOR MARKET-BASED INPUTS THAT ARE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF MOST FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION RATHER THAN MARKET QUOTES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH FIXED

MATURITIES, OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES IS INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 AS THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON UNADJUSTED MARKET PRICES.

THE

COMPANY REVIEWS THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE AND COMPARES THE ESTIMATES TO THE COMPANY'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE MARKET TO DETERMINE IF THE ESTIMATES OBTAINED

ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PRICES IN THE MARKET. THE COMPANY PRODUCES A REPORT MONTHLY THAT LISTS ALL PRICE CHANGES FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH IN EXCESS OF 10%. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE REPORT AND WILL

CHALLENGE ANY PRICES DEEMED NOT TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS OTHER PROCESSES INCLUDING RANDOMLY SELECTING PURCHASED OR SOLD SECURITIES AND

COMPARING EXECUTION PRICES TO THE ESTIMATES FROM THE PRICING SERVICE AS WELL AS REVIEWING REPORTS THAT CONTAIN SECURITIES WHOSE VALUATION DID NOT CHANGE FROM THEIR PREVIOUS VALUATION (STALE PRICE

REVIEW). THESE PROCESSES WERE IMPLEMENTED IN MID-2007 AND HAVE NOT HIGHLIGHTED ANY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE.

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY BEGAN USING ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES TO FURTHER TEST THE PRIMARY PRICING SERVICE'S VALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY

PORTFOLIO, AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE SUCH ADDITIONAL PRICING SERVICES IN FUTURE QUARTERS. USING CERTAIN MONTH-END DATA FROM OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2008, THE SECONDARY PRICING SERVICES

PROVIDED FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ON APPROXIMATELY 98% OF THE FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO, AND THOSE ESTIMATES, IN THE AGGREGATE, WERE NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE PROVIDED BY THE

COMPANY'S PRIMARY PRICING SERVICE.

THE

COMPANY HOLDS PRIVATELY PLACED CORPORATE BONDS AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL MATRIX THAT IS BASED ON MARKET INFORMATION REGARDING INTEREST RATES,

CREDIT SPREADS AND LIQUIDITY. THE UNDERLYING SOURCE DATA FOR CALCULATING THE MATRIX OF CREDIT SPREADS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE ARE THE MERRILL LYNCH U.S. CORPORATE INDEX AND THE MERRILL

LYNCH HIGH YIELD BB RATED INDEX. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF THESE CORPORATE BONDS IN LEVEL 2, SINCE ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE MARKET OBSERVABLE. AS MANY OF THESE

SECURITIES ARE ISSUED BY PUBLIC COMPANIES, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE COMPANIES' PUBLICLY TRADED DEBT TO TEST THE VALIDITY OF THE INTERNAL PRICING

MATRIX.

WHILE

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL NUMBER OF MUNICIPAL BONDS WHICH ARE NOT VALUED BY THE PRICING SERVICE

AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL PRICING MATRIX WITH SOME UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUATION. DUE TO THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET

INFORMATION, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THESE PARTICULAR BONDS IN LEVEL 3. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL AMOUNT OF FIXED MATURITIES THAT HAVE CHARACTERISTICS

THAT MAKE THEM UNSUITABLE FOR MATRIX PRICING. FOR THESE FIXED MATURITIES, THE COMPANY OBTAINS A QUOTE FROM A BROKER (TYPICALLY A MARKET

144

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAKER).

DUE TO THE DISCLAIMERS ON THE QUOTES THAT INDICATE THAT THE PRICE IS INDICATIVE ONLY, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN LEVEL 3.

EQUITIESPUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED

FOR PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS, THE COMPANY RECEIVES PRICES FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICE THAT ARE BASED ON

OBSERVABLE MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND INCLUDES THESE ESTIMATES IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1. INFREQUENTLY, CURRENT MARKET QUOTES IN ACTIVE MARKETS ARE UNAVAILABLE FOR CERTAIN

NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS HELD BY THE COMPANY. IN THESE INSTANCES, THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FROM THE PRICING SERVICE THAT PROVIDES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THE

COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITIES. THE SERVICE UTILIZES SOME OF THE SAME METHODOLOGIES TO PRICE THE NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS AS IT DOES FOR THE FIXED MATURITIES. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE

ESTIMATE IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES

THE

COMPANY HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS, WITH A FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE OF

$224 MILLION, REPORTED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS, WHERE THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE IS DETERMINED EITHER INTERNALLY OR BY AN EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER BASED ON RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE

SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTALS. THE COMPANY HOLDS SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF ONE PRIVATE COMPANY WITH A FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE OF $162 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, FOR WHICH THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY APPRAISER ON BEHALF OF THE INVESTEE AND ADJUSTED FOR A LIQUIDITY DISCOUNT WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMMON STOCK. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN THESE VALUATIONS, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE FOR ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 3.

DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES GENERALLY TO HEDGE ITS NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS

NON-PUBLIC WARRANTS IN A PUBLIC COMPANY AND HAS CONVERTIBLE BONDS CONTAINING EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS THAT ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY FROM THE HOST BOND CONTRACT. FOR THE DERIVATIVES USED

TO HEDGE THE NET INVESTMENT OF A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY, THE COMPANY USES QUOTED MARKET PRICES TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE, WHICH WAS IN A LIABILITY POSITION OF

APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, IN LEVEL 1. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE FOR THE WARRANTS USING AN OPTION PRICING MODEL WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS. BECAUSE

THE WARRANTS ARE NOT MARKET TRADED AND INFORMATION CONCERNING MARKET PARTICIPANTS IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE OF $87 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 IN

THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 3OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY SEPARATELY VALUES THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS AND INCLUDES THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE IN LEVEL 2.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS NOT REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES

THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST MAINLY OF HIGH-QUALITY COMMERCIAL PAPER (PRIMARILY A1/P1) WITH AN

AVERAGE OF 39 DAYS TO MATURITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS THE COMPANY'S POLICY TO NOT INVEST IN STRUCTURED PRODUCTS FOR ITS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT THERE IS INSIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK IN ITS SHORT-TERM PORTFOLIO AND THAT AMORTIZED COST APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY INCLUDES SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN ITS

IMPAIRMENT MONITORING TO IDENTIFY ANY CREDIT ISSUES.

145

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REAL ESTATE

REAL ESTATE IS RECORDED ON THE PURCHASE DATE AT THE PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH GENERALLY REPRESENTS FAIR VALUE, AND IS SUPPORTED BY INTERNAL

ANALYSIS OR EXTERNAL APPRAISALS, USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND OTHER ACCEPTABLE VALUATION TECHNIQUES. REAL ESTATE IS SUBSEQUENTLY CARRIED AT THE COMPANY'S COST, NET OF DEPRECIATION.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES OTHER INVESTMENTS NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WHICH INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED

PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS (TOGETHER, PARTNERSHIPS), JOINT VENTURES, AND MORTGAGE LOANS. THE COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR ITS INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIPS

AND JOINT VENTURES, AND AMORTIZED COST IS USED FOR MORTGAGE LOANS.

THE

PARTNERSHIPS GENERALLY REPORT INVESTMENTS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED BY THE INVESTEE ARE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY ON A LAG BASIS, WITH THE

LAG PERIOD GENERALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE TYPE OF UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. THE PRIVATE EQUITY PARTNERSHIPS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION QUARTERLY WHICH IS GENERALLY

AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WITHIN THREE TO SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE HEDGE FUNDS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION MONTHLY, WHICH IS GENERALLY

AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS WITHIN ONE MONTH FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REQUESTS FINANCIAL INFORMATION FROM THE PARTNERSHIPS PRIOR TO THE RECEIPT OF THE PARTNERSHIPS'

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND RECORDS ANY MATERIAL INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THESE REQUESTS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WHEN AN INVESTED ASSET'S VALUE DECLINES BELOW COST, ADJUSTED FOR ACCRETION, AMORTIZATION AND

PREVIOUS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS (NEW COST BASIS), AND IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. SOME OF THE FACTORS

CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE: (1) THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF

TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (2) THE RECOVERABILITY OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES, OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; (3) THE

LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN AMORTIZED COST FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES, OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND (4) THE FINANCIAL CONDITION,

NEAR-TERM AND LONG-TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING THE RELEVANT INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND TRENDS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS AND OFFERING PRICES. WHEN THE

COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN INVESTED ASSET IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, THE INVESTED ASSET IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE, AND THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS INCLUDED IN

EARNINGS AS A REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSS. THE FAIR VALUE THEN BECOMES THE NEW COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT, AND ANY SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE, OTHER THAN AMOUNTS ACCRETED TO THE EXPECTED

RECOVERY AMOUNT, ARE RECOGNIZED AT DISPOSITION. DUE TO THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S ANALYSIS AND ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE, ALONG WITH THE JUDGMENT THAT MUST BE APPLIED IN THE ANALYSIS, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANY COULD REACH A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPAIR A SECURITY IF IT HAD ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE INVESTEE. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO MEET FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE COMPANY DETERMINED DURING ITS ANALYSIS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO A DIFFERENT IMPAIRMENT CONCLUSION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES A REALIZED LOSS WHEN IMPAIRMENT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY EVEN IF A DECISION TO SELL AN INVESTED ASSET HAS NOT BEEN MADE. WHEN

THE COMPANY HAS DECIDED TO SELL A TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTED ASSET AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTED ASSET TO FULLY RECOVER

PRIOR TO THE EXPECTED TIME OF SALE, THE INVESTED ASSET IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DECISION TO SELL IS MADE.

146

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY'S PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING AND REVIEWING INVESTED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENTS DURING ANY QUARTER INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING.



IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE POSSIBLE INDICATIONS OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF ALL INVESTMENTS WITH GROSS UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES THAT HAVE FAIR VALUES LESS THAN 80% OF COST;



REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF ANY OTHER INVESTMENTS BASED ON THE INVESTEE'S CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, NEAR-TERM RECOVERY PROSPECTS, THE OUTLOOK

FOR THE BUSINESS SECTORS IN WHICH THE INVESTEE OPERATES AND OTHER FACTORS (IN ADDITION TO REVIEWING INVESTMENTS WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF LESS THAN 80% OF COST);



CONSIDERATION OF EVIDENTIAL MATTER, INCLUDING AN EVALUATION OF FACTORS OR TRIGGERS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT CAUSE INDIVIDUAL

INVESTMENTS TO QUALIFY AS HAVING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS; AND



DETERMINATION OF THE STATUS OF EACH ANALYZED INVESTMENT AS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY OR NOT, WITH

DOCUMENTATION OF THE RATIONALE FOR THE DECISION.

SALES OF TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INVESTED ASSETS

THE COMPANY MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, SELL INVESTED ASSETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE THAT WERE CONSIDERED TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED

AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. SUCH SALES

ARE GENERALLY DUE TO EVENTS OCCURRING SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE THAT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S INTENT OR ABILITY TO HOLD AN INVESTED ASSET. THE TYPES OF EVENTS THAT MAY RESULT IN

A SALE INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO THE INVESTED ASSET, SIGNIFICANT UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN AN INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIARY'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS, OR CHANGES IN

TAX LAWS OR THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES

AN INVESTMENT IN A FIXED MATURITY OR EQUITY SECURITY WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR SALE IS IMPAIRED IF ITS FAIR VALUE FALLS BELOW ITS COST OR

NEW COST BASIS, AND THE DECLINE IS CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. A FIXED MATURITY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED IF IT IS PROBABLE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SECURITY'S CONTRACTUAL TERMS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE THE INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY, OR THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO

RECOVER ITS COST OVER A FORECASTED RECOVERY PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY, FOR CERTAIN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS (INCLUDING ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), THE COMPANY UPDATES ITS

ESTIMATE OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OVER THE LIFE OF THE SECURITY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSET AND THE PRESENT

VALUE OF THE ASSET'S CASH FLOWS ESTIMATED AT THE CURRENT FINANCIAL REPORTING DATE ARE LESS THAN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE (OR PREVIOUS FINANCIAL REPORTING

DATE), THEN AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED AND THE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSET IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE. EQUITY SECURITIES ARE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED WHEN IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOVER ITS COST OVER A FORECASTED RECOVERY PERIOD.

FOR

SECURITIES EXPECTED TO BE SOLD, AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY TO RECOVER

PRIOR TO THE EXPECTED DATE OF SALE. FOR PUBLIC SECURITIES MANAGED BY EXTERNAL MANAGERS, THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSERT THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITIES TO RECOVERY AND THEREFORE CONSIDERS THE

SECURITIES IMPAIRED WHEN THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW THE COST BASIS AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD.

147

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, THE COMPANY OBTAINS INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS. IN

ADDITION, THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REAL ESTATE PROPERTY IS REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE. THE REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERS THE VALUATION FROM THE INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL, WHEN APPLICABLE, AND INCORPORATES AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE

USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY.

THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS MEASURED AS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

MORTGAGE LOANS

A

MORTGAGE LOAN IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST AMOUNTS DUE. FOR MORTGAGE LOANS

THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED, A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY

USES INTEREST RATES REFLECTING THE CURRENT REAL ESTATE FINANCING MARKET RETURNS. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPAIRED MORTGAGE LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007.

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES

EXTERNALLY

MANAGED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT BY THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER AND THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. INTERNALLY MANAGED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC AND

PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY BY THE COMPANY'S

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER REVIEW AND CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE VALUATION OF THE INVESTMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



THE INVESTEE'S MOST RECENT FINANCING EVENTS;



AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER A FUNDAMENTAL DETERIORATION OR IMPROVEMENT HAS OCCURRED;



WHETHER THE INVESTEE'S PROGRESS HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE OR LESS THAN EXPECTED;



WHETHER OR NOT THE VALUATIONS HAVE IMPROVED OR DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE INVESTEE'S MARKET SECTOR;



WHETHER OR NOT THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER AND THE COMPANY BELIEVE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE INVESTEE WILL NEED FINANCING

WITHIN SIX MONTHS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN THE COMPANY'S CARRYING VALUE; AND



WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR

RECOVERY, ENABLING THE COMPANY TO RECEIVE VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN ITS COST.

AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF, BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER ALL OF ITS COST OF AN INDIVIDUAL HOLDING.

THE QUARTERLY VALUATION PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY TO FREQUENTLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THOSE INVESTED ASSETS, PAYING

PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EVENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS.

148

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER INVESTMENTS EXCLUDING VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES

INCLUDED

IN OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT GENERALLY REPORT

INVESTMENTS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COMPANY USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT NO LESS FREQUENTLY

THAN QUARTERLY AND MONITORS THE PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MANAGERS/GENERAL PARTNERS. IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF AN IMPAIRMENT OF A PARTNERSHIP'S INVESTMENTS AT

THE BALANCE SHEET DATE PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE PARTNERSHIP'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IT WILL RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT BY RECORDING A REDUCTION IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH A CORRESPONDING

CHARGE TO NET INVESTMENT INCOME.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IMPAIRMENTS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS A REVIEW, ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, OF GOODWILL HELD BY THE REPORTING UNITS WHICH ARE THE COMPANY'S THREE

OPERATING AND REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: BUSINESS INSURANCE, FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE, AND PERSONAL INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS AND

COMPARES IT TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEED THEIR FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS CALCULATED AND GOODWILL IS ADJUSTED

ACCORDINGLY.

IN

2008, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FROM A MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS MODEL TO A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL. THIS CHANGE WAS MADE

AS A RESULT OF THE EFFECTS OF A SEVERE DISRUPTION OF THE CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT CAUSED DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS OF THE

COMPANY AND THE OBSERVED MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS OF ITS COMPETITORS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL IS AN INCOME APPROACH TO VALUATION THAT IS BASED ON A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS FOR DERIVING A CURRENT

FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS AND IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL RELIES ON THE COMPANY'S ASSUMPTIONS OF ITS

FUTURE OPERATING EARNINGS, DISCOUNTED UTILIZING AN ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANY'S COST OF EQUITY. OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY THE COMPANY ARE ALSO REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST

AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASSET AS INDEFINITE-LIVED IS REASSESSED, AND AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE FINITE USEFUL LIFE ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A FINITE USEFUL LIFE IS REGULARLY

REVIEWED FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT IN VALUE. IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE FROM ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND IS MEASURED AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

THE

COMPANY'S REVIEW DID NOT RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF ITS INDEFINITE-LIVED OR FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO PREPARE ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP), AS PROMULGATED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB). DURING 2008, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) ISSUED A PROPOSED ROADMAP FOR COMMENT FOR THE POTENTIAL USE IN FILINGS WITH THE SEC OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR U.S.

ISSUERS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS), AS PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (IASB), INSTEAD OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE

ROADMAP CONTAINS MILESTONES THAT, IF ACHIEVED, MAY LEAD THE SEC TO DECIDE IN 2011 TO REQUIRE THE USE OF IFRS FOR LARGE ACCELERATED FILERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, IN 2014. THE SEC ALSO IS PROPOSING TO

PERMIT U.S. COMPANIES TO ELECT TO FILE USING IFRS, AS ADOPTED BY THE IASB, AS EARLY AS

2010, IF THE COMPANY IS IN AN INDUSTRY GROUP THAT REPORTS USING IFRS MORE COMMONLY THAN ANY OTHER SET OF STANDARDS, AND IF THE COMPANY IS ONE OF THE 20 LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE

BASED ON MARKET CAPITALIZATION. THE IASB AND THE FASB ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A GLOBAL INSURANCE STANDARD THAT MAY INVOLVE METHODOLOGIES FOR VALUING INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES THAT MAY BE

SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE METHODOLOGIES REQUIRED BY CURRENT GAAP. THE FASB AND THE IASB ARE ALSO EMBARKED ON A LONG-TERM PROJECT TO CONVERGE GAAP AND IFRS. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE

TO PREDICT WHETHER IT WILL CHOOSE TO, OR BE REQUIRED TO, ADOPT IFRS OR HOW THE ADOPTION OF IFRS (OR THE CONVERGENCE OF GAAP AND IFRS) MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THIS REPORT CONTAINS, AND MANAGEMENT MAY MAKE, CERTAIN "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. ALL STATEMENTS, OTHER THAN STATEMENTS OF HISTORICAL FACTS, MAY BE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SPECIFICALLY, EARNINGS GUIDANCE, STATEMENTS ABOUT THE COMPANY'S SHARE

REPURCHASE PLANS, STATEMENTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE RECENT DISRUPTION IN THE INVESTMENT MARKETS AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND UNDERWRITING RESULTS

ARE FORWARD LOOKING, AND THE COMPANY MAY MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, PREMIUM VOLUME, NET AND OPERATING INCOME, INVESTMENT INCOME, RETURN

ON EQUITY, EXPECTED CURRENT RETURNS AND COMBINED RATIO), AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, INVESTED ASSETS AND LIQUIDITY); THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANY'S ASBESTOS AND OTHER RESERVES

(INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, ASBESTOS CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS); THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF REINSURANCE COVERAGE; CATASTROPHE LOSSES; INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT, ECONOMIC AND UNDERWRITING MARKET

CONDITIONS; AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. SUCH STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND GENERALLY BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL, THAT COULD CAUSE

ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED IN, OR IMPLIED OR PROJECTED BY, THE FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION AND STATEMENTS.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND PRICES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT

SPREADS), FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND OTHER RELEVANT MARKET RATE OR PRICE CHANGES. MARKET RISK IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE RELATED

UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE TRADED. THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES AND HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE COMPANY'S

150

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET

RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES, ARE PRIMARILY ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING.

THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 WAS $70.74 BILLION AND $74.82 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 87% WAS

INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AT BOTH DATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, APPROXIMATELY 5.5% AND 6.5%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS WERE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO EQUITY PRICE RISK IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY HAS NO DIRECT COMMODITY RISK AND IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS.

THE

COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 INCLUDED ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES AND

COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS BACKED BY ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION MORTGAGES WITH A COLLECTIVE MARKET VALUE OF $206 MILLION AND $286 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY

0.3% AND 0.4% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS, RESPECTIVELY). THE DISRUPTION IN SECONDARY INVESTMENT MARKETS FOR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES PROVIDED THE COMPANY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY

TO SELECTIVELY ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES AT DISCOUNTED PRICES. THE COMPANY PURCHASED $47 MILLION AND $89 MILLION OF

SUCH SECURITIES IN 2008 AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DEFINES SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AS INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY

EXHIBIT ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: LOW FICO SCORES, ABOVE-PRIME INTEREST RATES, HIGH LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS OR HIGH DEBT-TO-INCOME

RATIOS. ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION SECURITIZATIONS ARE

THOSE IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING LOANS PRIMARILY MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT SCORE BUT DO NOT MEET THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITY'S GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION,

PROPERTY TYPE, DEBT AND LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING ON THESE SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS HELD BY THE COMPANY WAS "AA2" AND "AAA" AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. APPROXIMATELY $81 MILLION OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME AND ALTERNATIVE DOCUMENTATION MORTGAGES WERE DOWNGRADED IN 2008.

THE

COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 INCLUDED SECURITIES ISSUED BY NUMEROUS STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS (COLLECTIVELY

REFERRED TO AS THE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO), A NUMBER OF WHICH WERE ENHANCED BY THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF AN ISSUER DEFAULT. THE DOWNGRADE OF

CREDIT RATINGS OF INSURERS OF THESE SECURITIES HAS RESULTED IN A CORRESPONDING DOWNGRADE IN THE RATINGS OF THE SECURITIES TO THE UNDERLYING RATING OF THE RESPECTIVE SECURITY. OF THE INSURED MUNICIPAL

BOND PORTFOLIO, APPROXIMATELY 99% WERE RATED AT A3 OR ABOVE, AND APPROXIMATELY 81% WERE RATED AT AA3 OR ABOVE, WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE. IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE AND

ADVERSELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND/OR REVENUES OF STATES, MUNICIPALITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S HOLDINGS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY

BELIEVES, BASED ON CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, THAT A FURTHER LOSS OF THE BENEFIT OF INSURANCE WOULD NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION

OR LIQUIDITY, DUE TO THE UNDERLYING CREDIT STRENGTH OF THE ISSUERS OF THE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITIES. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE UNDERLYING

ISSUERS OF THESE SECURITIES WAS "AA3" AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THE ENTIRE MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIO WAS "AA1" AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WITH AND WITHOUT THE

THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE AND INCLUDES PRE-FUNDED AND ESCROWED TO MATURITY SECURITIES, AS WELL AS SECURITIES ISSUED WITHOUT THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE.

THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES. THE PORTFOLIO DURATION RELATIVE TO THE

LIABILITIES' DURATION IS PRIMARILY MANAGED THROUGH CASH MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND TREASURY FUTURES TRANSACTIONS.

THE

COMPANY'S TAX-EXEMPT FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TOTALED $38.79 BILLION AND $38.55 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

THAT WOULD LESSEN OR IMPROVE SOME OR ALL OF THE TAX ADVANTAGES CURRENTLY BENEFITING THE COMPANY AND RESULT IN AN ADVERSE OR FAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF THESE HOLDINGS.

THE

PRIMARY MARKET RISK FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT IS INTEREST RATE RISK AT THE TIME OF REFINANCING. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND EVALUATES REFINANCING

OPPORTUNITIES AS MATURITY DATES APPROACH. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S DEBT SEE NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE

"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" SECTION OF "ITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS."

THE

COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURE IS CONCENTRATED IN THE COMPANY'S INVESTED ASSETS AND INSURANCE RESERVES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. CASH FLOWS FROM THE

COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY TO FUND INSURANCE

RESERVES AND OTHER LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN THE SAME CURRENCY, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE. INVESTED ASSETS DENOMINATED IN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING COMPRISED

APPROXIMATELY 2.3% AND 2.9% OF THE TOTAL INVESTED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 2.2% OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTED

ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 OR 2007.

THERE

WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES WERE MANAGED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 COMPARED TO THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ITS PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES OR IN HOW THOSE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN FUTURE REPORTING

PERIODS BASED UPON WHAT IS KNOWN OR EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS DEFINED AS THE MEASUREMENT OF POTENTIAL LOSS IN FUTURE EARNINGS, FAIR VALUES OR CASH FLOWS OF MARKET SENSITIVE

INSTRUMENTS RESULTING FROM ONE OR MORE SELECTED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET RATES OR PRICES OVER A SELECTED PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE COMPANY'S SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, A

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET RATES IS SELECTED THAT IS EXPECTED TO REFLECT REASONABLY POSSIBLE NEAR-TERM CHANGES IN THOSE RATES. "NEAR-TERM" MEANS A PERIOD OF TIME GOING

FORWARD UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET RATES ASSUMED IN THIS DISCLOSURE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE RESULTS OF ANY ACTIONS THAT WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE COMPANY TO MITIGATE SUCH HYPOTHETICAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE.

INTEREST RATE RISK

IN THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL INCLUDES

THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING: FIXED MATURITIES, NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, MORTGAGE LOANS, SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, DEBT

AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO THE COMPANY'S MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INTEREST RATE RISK (INCLUSIVE OF CREDIT SPREADS). THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USES A

100 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES TO MEASURE THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MODEL.

FOR

INVESTED ASSETS WITH PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, ESTIMATES OF PORTFOLIO DURATION AND CONVEXITY ARE USED TO MODEL THE LOSS OF FAIR VALUE THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO RESULT

FROM A PARALLEL INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES. DURATIONS ON INVESTED ASSETS ARE ADJUSTED FOR CALL, PUT AND INTEREST RATE RESET FEATURES. DURATIONS ON TAX-EXEMPT SECURITIES ARE ADJUSTED FOR

THE FACT THAT THE YIELDS ON SUCH SECURITIES DO NOT NORMALLY MOVE IN LOCKSTEP WITH CHANGES IN THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE. FIXED MATURITY PORTFOLIO

152

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURATIONS

ARE CALCULATED ON A MARKET VALUE WEIGHTED BASIS, INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST, USING HOLDINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007.

FOR

DEBT, THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY CALCULATING HYPOTHETICAL DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 ENDING PRICES BASED ON YIELDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE,

COMPARING SUCH HYPOTHETICAL ENDING PRICES TO ACTUAL ENDING PRICES, AND MULTIPLYING THE DIFFERENCE BY THE PAR OR SECURITIES OUTSTANDING.

THE

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL USED BY THE COMPANY PRODUCES A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION BASED ON A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE

IN INTEREST RATES AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007.

THE

LOSS ESTIMATES DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE INTERVENTIONS THAT THE COMPANY MIGHT REASONABLY UNDERTAKE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE OR AVOID LOSSES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM

EMERGING INTEREST RATE TRENDS. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS VALUE ONLY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF AN INTEREST RATE INCREASE ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. AS A RESULT, THE LOSS VALUE

EXCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, PRIMARILY CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, WHICH IF INCLUDED IN THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL, WOULD MITIGATE

THE IMPACT OF THE LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO MEASURE ITS POTENTIAL LOSS FROM FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS. A

HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN VALUE OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE FOREIGN DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. THE POTENTIAL LOSS IS REDUCED BY FOREIGN

CURRENCY FORWARD TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY'S ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT A HYPOTHETICAL 10% REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF

FOREIGN DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $386 MILLION AND $485 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE

COMPANY). THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND

CLAIMS AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE 2007 AND 2006 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM TO THE

2008 PRESENTATION. ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS

(FAS 157). FAS 157 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. IT

APPLIES TO OTHER PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT REQUIRE OR PERMIT FAIR VALUE BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE STATEMENT DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS "THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN

ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE."

FAS 157

ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY TO INCREASE CONSISTENCY AND COMPARABILITY IN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES. THE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE INPUTS USED IN

VALUATION AND GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL SHOULD BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. FAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING

AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007.

IN

FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) FAS 157-2,

EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157

(FSP FAS 157-2), WHICH PERMITS A ONE-YEAR DEFERRAL OF THE APPLICATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS

, FOR ALL NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND NON-FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, EXCEPT THOSE THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY).

THE

COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 157 AND FSP FAS 157-2 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, AND ELECTED NOT TO APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 157 TO GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY THE COMPANY AND MEASURED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING PURPOSES ONLY. THE ADOPTION OF FAS 157 AND FSP FAS 157-2 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT FAS 157 FOR NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND NON-FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ON

JANUARY 1, 2009 AND DOES NOT EXPECT THE PROVISIONS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IN

OCTOBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FAS 157-3,

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT

ACTIVE

(FSP FAS 157-3), WITH AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE, INCLUDING PRIOR PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED. FSP

FAS 157-3 AMENDS FAS 157 TO CLARIFY THE APPLICATION OF FAIR VALUE IN INACTIVE MARKETS AND ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF MANAGEMENT'S INTERNAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE CASH FLOWS WITH

APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES WHEN RELEVANT OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA DOES NOT EXIST. THE OBJECTIVE OF FAS 157 HAS NOT CHANGED AND CONTINUES TO BE THE DETERMINATION OF THE

PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

THAT

IS NOT A FORCED LIQUIDATION OR DISTRESSED SALE AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE ADOPTION OF FSP FAS 157-3 IN THE THIRD QUARTER DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IMPAIRMENT OF STRUCTURED SECURITIES

IN JANUARY 2009, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) EITF 99-20-1,

AMENDMENTS TO THE IMPAIRMENT GUIDANCE OF EITF ISSUE NO. 99-20

(FSP EITF 99-20-1), WHICH IS EFFECTIVE

FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. FSP EITF 99-20-1 AMENDS EITF 99-20,

RECOGNITION OF

INTEREST INCOME AND IMPAIRMENT ON PURCHASED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS AND BENEFICIAL INTERESTS THAT CONTINUE TO BE HELD BY A TRANSFEROR IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS

(EITF 99-20), TO ALIGN THE IMPAIRMENT GUIDANCE IN EITF 99-20 WITH THE IMPAIRMENT GUIDANCE IN FAS 115,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

. FSP EITF 99-20-1 AMENDS THE CASH FLOWS MODEL USED TO ANALYZE AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT UNDER EITF 99-20 BY REPLACING THE MARKET PARTICIPANT VIEW WITH MANAGEMENT'S ASSUMPTION OF WHETHER IT IS PROBABLE THAT THERE

IS AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS. THE ADOPTION OF FSP EITF 99-20-1 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES



INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115

(FAS 159). FAS 159 PERMITS AN ENTITY TO IRREVOCABLY ELECT FAIR VALUE ON A CONTRACT-BY-CONTRACT BASIS FOR NEW ASSETS OR LIABILITIES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF

FAS 159 AS THE INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THOSE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS INCLUDING PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE CONTRACTS. ENTITIES ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE IN EARNINGS AND TO EXPENSE UP-FRONT COSTS AND FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ITEM FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION IS ELECTED. ENTITIES ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE REQUIRED TO DISTINGUISH ON THE FACE OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED, AND SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING ANOTHER MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE. AN ENTITY CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS BY EITHER REPORTING THE

FAIR VALUE AND NON-FAIR-VALUE CARRYING AMOUNTS AS SEPARATE LINE ITEMS OR AGGREGATING THOSE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSING PARENTHETICALLY THE AMOUNT OF FAIR VALUE INCLUDED IN THE

AGGREGATE AMOUNT.

FAS 159

WAS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007. UPON ADOPTION, AN ENTITY IS PERMITTED TO ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION IRREVOCABLY FOR ANY EXISTING

ASSET OR LIABILITY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE STANDARD. THE ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO

RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE DATE OF INITIAL ADOPTION. RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED. THE COMPANY DID NOT ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR ANY OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CURRENTLY

HELD UPON ITS ADOPTION OF FAS 159 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008. THEREFORE, FAS 159 DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY AT

ADOPTION.

IN JUNE 2007, THE FASB ISSUED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 06-11,

ACCOUNTING FOR

INCOME TAX BENEFITS OF DIVIDENDS ON SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

AWARDS

(EITF 06-11). EITF 06-11 REQUIRES THAT REALIZED INCOME TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO DIVIDEND PAYMENTS THAT ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED

EARNINGS AND PAID TO EMPLOYEES HOLDING EQUITY SHARES, NONVESTED EQUITY SHARE UNITS AND OUTSTANDING EQUITY SHARE OPTIONS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS AN INCREASE IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL.

EITF 06-11 APPLIES TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT ARE DECLARED IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2007. THE ADOPTION OF EITF 06-11 AT

JANUARY 1, 2008 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

EMPLOYERS' ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R)

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS'

ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R)

(FAS 158). FAS 158

REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER TO RECOGNIZE THE FUNDED STATUS OF A BENEFIT PLAN AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAN ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE AND

THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION, AND TO RECOGNIZE AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES, NET OF TAX, ACTUARIAL GAINS OR LOSSES AND PRIOR SERVICE COSTS OR CREDITS THAT

ARISE DURING THE PERIOD BUT WHICH ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST PURSUANT TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 87,

(FAS 106). THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 87 AND FAS 106 CONTINUE TO APPLY IN MEASURING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, AS OF THE DATE OF THE FISCAL

YEAR-END STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, AND IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 158 WERE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS ENDING AFTER

DECEMBER 15, 2006 AND DID NOT ALLOW RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION. THE COMPANY'S ADOPTION OF FAS 158 EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006 RESULTED IN AN $80 MILLION REDUCTION, NET OF

TAX, TO SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY IN 2006 AND WAS RECOGNIZED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE ENDING BALANCE OF ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES. THE ADOPTION OF FAS 158 DID NOT

AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY AS FAS 158 DOES NOT AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST. SEE NOTE 13.

DETERMINATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

IN APRIL 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) FAS 142-3,

DETERMINATION OF THE

USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

. THE FSP AMENDS THE FACTORS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD CONSIDER IN DETERMINING THE USEFUL LIFE OF A RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSET UNDER

FAS 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

TO INCLUDE THE ENTITY'S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE IN RENEWING OR EXTENDING SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS,

WHETHER OR NOT THE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE EXPLICIT RENEWAL OR EXTENSION PROVISIONS. PREVIOUSLY, AN ENTITY WAS PRECLUDED FROM USING ITS OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RENEWAL OR EXTENSION OF AN ARRANGEMENT WHERE

THERE WAS LIKELY TO BE SUBSTANTIAL COST OR MODIFICATIONS. ENTITIES WITHOUT THEIR OWN HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE SHOULD CONSIDER THE ASSUMPTIONS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE ABOUT RENEWAL OR EXTENSION. THE

AMENDMENT MAY RESULT IN THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ENTITY'S INTANGIBLE ASSET DIFFERING FROM THE PERIOD OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS THAT WAS USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET USING THE

MARKET PARTICIPANT'S PERCEIVED VALUE. THE FSP ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON AN ENTITY'S INTENT AND/OR ABILITY TO RENEW OR EXTEND THE ARRANGEMENT.

THE

FSP IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008, AND FOR INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS

PROHIBITED. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR DETERMINING THE USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS APPLY TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009. THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE APPLIED

PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECOGNIZED AS OF, AND SUBSEQUENT TO, THE EFFECTIVE DATE.

PARTICIPATING SECURITIES GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS

IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) EITF 03-6-1,

DETERMINING

WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES.

THIS FSP ADDRESSES WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS

ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES PRIOR TO VESTING AND, THEREFORE, SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE EARNINGS ALLOCATION IN COMPUTING EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) UNDER THE TWO-CLASS METHOD DESCRIBED IN

FAS 128,

EARNINGS PER SHARE

. THE FSP REDEFINES PARTICIPATING SECURITIES TO INCLUDE UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT CONTAIN

NON-FORFEITABLE DIVIDENDS OR DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS AS PARTICIPATING SECURITIES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF EPS PURSUANT TO THE "TWO-CLASS METHOD." OUTSTANDING UNVESTED

RESTRICTED STOCK AND DEFERRED STOCK UNITS ISSUED UNDER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS CONTAINING SUCH DIVIDEND PARTICIPATION FEATURES WOULD BE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES SUBJECT TO THE

"TWO-CLASS METHOD" IN COMPUTING EPS RATHER THAN THE "TREASURY STOCK METHOD."

THE

FSP IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008 AND FOR INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS. EARLY APPLICATION WAS NOT

PERMITTED. THE COMPANY HAS ESTIMATED THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FSP COMPUTATIONAL GUIDANCE WILL REDUCE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BASIC EPS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 BY $0.03 PER

SHARE AND $0.04 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY, AND REDUCE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED DILUTED EPS BY $0.01 PER SHARE FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF

THE FSP, UPON ADOPTION IN 2009, ALL

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED REVISED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 141R,

BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS

(FAS 141R), A REPLACEMENT OF FAS 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

. FAS 141R PROVIDES REVISED

GUIDANCE ON HOW AN ACQUIRER RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND ANY NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE. IN ADDITION,

IT PROVIDES REVISED GUIDANCE ON THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF GOODWILL ACQUIRED IN THE BUSINESS COMBINATION.

FAS 141R

ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE SPECIFIC TO THE RECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, AND MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ACQUIRED IN A

BUSINESS COMBINATION.

FAS 141R

APPLIES TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR ACQUISITIONS OCCURRING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009. ACCORDINGLY, FAS 141R DOES NOT IMPACT THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PURCHASE ACCOUNTING.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 160,

NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



AN AMENDMENT OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN NO. 51

(FAS 160). FAS 160 AMENDS ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN NO. 51 TO ESTABLISH ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN A SUBSIDIARY AND FOR THE

DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY. IN ADDITION, IT CLARIFIES THAT A NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN A SUBSIDIARY IS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITY THAT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF

EQUITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FAS 160

IS EFFECTIVE ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009, EXCEPT FOR THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE APPLIED ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 160 TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

EMPLOYERS' DISCLOSURES ABOUT POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) FAS 132(R)-1,

EMPLOYERS'

DISCLOSURES ABOUT POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS

. THE FSP REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER TO PROVIDE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ABOUT PLAN ASSETS OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OR OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED INCLUDE THE INVESTMENT POLICIES AND STRATEGIES OF THE PLANS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS, THE INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES

USED TO DEVELOP FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND A DESCRIPTION OF SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK IN PLAN ASSETS. THE FSP IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2009.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INVESTMENTS

FIXED MATURITY AND EQUITY SECURITIES

FIXED MATURITIES INCLUDE BONDS, NOTES AND REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS. FIXED MATURITIES, INCLUDING INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO SECURITIES

LENDING AGREEMENTS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF INCOME TAXES, CREDITED OR CHARGED DIRECTLY TO ACCUMULATED

OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES. EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE PUBLIC COMMON AND NON-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS, ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE WITH CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE, NET OF INCOME TAX, CHARGED OR CREDITED DIRECTLY TO ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES.

REAL ESTATE

THE COMPANY'S REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE WAREHOUSES, OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL LAND AND PROPERTIES THAT ARE DIRECTLY

OWNED. REAL ESTATE IS RECORDED ON THE PURCHASE DATE AT THE PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH GENERALLY REPRESENTS FAIR VALUE, AND IS SUPPORTED BY INTERNAL ANALYSIS OR EXTERNAL APPRAISALS, USING DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW ANALYSES AND OTHER ACCEPTABLE VALUATION TECHNIQUES. REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES IS SUBSEQUENTLY CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SHORTER OF THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OF THE BUILDING OR 39 YEARS. ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ON REAL ESTATE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES WAS

$140 MILLION AND $111 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. REAL ESTATE HELD FOR SALE IS CARRIED AT LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, LESS ESTIMATED COST TO SELL.

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST MAINLY OF

HIGH-QUALITY COMMERCIAL PAPER (PRIMARILY A1/P1) WITH AN AVERAGE OF 39 DAYS TO MATURITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS THE COMPANY'S POLICY TO NOT INVEST IN

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS FOR ITS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THERE IS INSIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK IN ITS SHORT-TERM PORTFOLIO AND THAT AMORTIZED COST

APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY INCLUDES SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN ITS IMPAIRMENT MONITORING TO IDENTIFY ANY CREDIT ISSUES.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES

THE

COMPANY HOLDS VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS "AVAILABLE FOR

SALE," WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, NET OF INCOME TAX, CHARGED OR CREDITED DIRECTLY TO ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES. THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE IS DETERMINED EITHER INTERNALLY

OR BY AN EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER BASED ON RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH, AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTALS. THE COMPANY'S VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

ARE GENERALLY NON-PUBLICLY TRADED INSTRUMENTS IN EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES AND HISTORICALLY HAVE A HOLDING PERIOD OF FOUR TO SEVEN YEARS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE HEALTH CARE,

SOFTWARE AND COMPUTER SERVICES, AND NETWORKING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES INFRASTRUCTURES INDUSTRIES. THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS OF THESE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE

DETERMINED

BY THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER AND REVIEWED BY THE COMPANY FOR INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THERE IS NO PUBLIC MARKET.

IN

MAY 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE BUNDLED SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO. PRIOR TO THE SALE, THESE VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE SALE, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WERE CONSOLIDATED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007.

OTHER

OTHER

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, JOINT VENTURES, NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND

PREFERRED EQUITIES, MORTGAGE LOANS AND TRADING SECURITIES. THE COMPANY USES THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND JOINT

VENTURES. THE PARTNERSHIPS AND HEDGE FUNDS GENERALLY REPORT INVESTMENTS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED BY THE INVESTEE ARE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY ON A LAG

BASIS, WITH THE LAG PERIOD GENERALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE TYPE OF UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. THE PRIVATE EQUITY PARTNERSHIPS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION QUARTERLY WHICH IS

GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WITHIN THREE TO SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE HEDGE FUNDS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION MONTHLY WHICH IS AVAILABLE

TO INVESTORS WITHIN ONE MONTH FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REQUESTS FINANCIAL INFORMATION FROM THE PARTNERSHIPS PRIOR TO THE RECEIPT OF THE PARTNERSHIPS' FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AND RECORDS ANY MATERIAL INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THESE REQUESTS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MORTGAGE LOANS ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. TRADING SECURITIES ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH

THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY MAY USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, EQUITY SWAPS,

CREDIT DERIVATIVES, OPTIONS, FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL FUTURES, AS A MEANS OF HEDGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE, EQUITY PRICE CHANGE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. DURING 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY

USED U.S. TREASURY NOTE FUTURES TO MODIFY THE DURATION OF SPECIFIC ASSETS WITHIN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND A FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE OF AN INVESTMENT IN

A FOREIGN OPERATION. THE COMPANY ALSO HELD NON-PUBLIC STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS OF A PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY WHICH ARE REPORTED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

THE DERIVATIVES USED BY THE COMPANY, SEE NOTE 3.

THE

COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES ALL DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS, AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND MEASURES THOSE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE. WHERE APPLICABLE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS USED TO ACCOUNT FOR

DERIVATIVES. FOR AN INSTRUMENT TO QUALIFY AS A HEDGE, THE HEDGE RELATIONSHIP MUST BE DESIGNATED AND FORMALLY DOCUMENTED AT INCEPTION, DETAILING THE PARTICULAR RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY

FOR THE HEDGE, INCLUDING THE ITEM AND RISK THAT ARE BEING HEDGED, THE DERIVATIVE THAT IS BEING USED, AND HOW EFFECTIVENESS IS BEING ASSESSED. A DERIVATIVE MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN ACCOMPLISHING THE

OBJECTIVE OF OFFSETTING EITHER CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS IS EVALUATED ON A RETROSPECTIVE AND PROSPECTIVE BASIS

USING QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF

CORRELATION.

IF A HEDGE RELATIONSHIP IS FOUND TO BE INEFFECTIVE, IT NO LONGER QUALIFIES AS A HEDGE, AND ANY EXCESS GAINS OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH INEFFECTIVENESS AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES). THE RECOGNITION OF GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFY AS A HEDGE DEPENDS UPON WHETHER

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE, A CASH FLOW HEDGE OR A FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE.

DERIVATIVES

THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT

GAINS (LOSSES).

NET INVESTMENT INCOME

INVESTMENT INCOME FROM FIXED MATURITIES AND MORTGAGE LOANS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONSTANT EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD WHICH INCLUDES AN

ADJUSTMENT FOR ESTIMATED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS, IF ANY. THE EFFECTIVE YIELD USED TO DETERMINE AMORTIZATION FOR FIXED MATURITIES SUBJECT TO PREPAYMENT RISK (E.G., ASSET-BACKED,

LOAN-BACKED AND STRUCTURED SECURITIES) IS RECALCULATED AND ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY BASED UPON ACTUAL HISTORICAL AND/OR PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM A WIDELY-ACCEPTED

SECURITIES DATA PROVIDER. THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE YIELD FOR HIGHLY RATED PREPAYABLE FIXED MATURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE YIELD FOR

NON-HIGHLY RATED PREPAYABLE FIXED MATURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PROSPECTIVE METHOD. DIVIDENDS ON EQUITY SECURITIES (PUBLIC AND NON-PUBLIC) AND VENTURE CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME WHEN DECLARED. RENTAL INCOME ON REAL ESTATE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.

SEE

NOTE 3 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS, HEDGE FUNDS AND JOINT VENTURES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHEREBY THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF THE INVESTEE'S EARNINGS OR LOSSES IN THE FUND ARE REPORTED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME. TRADING SECURITIES ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH THE CHANGE IN

FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN NET INVESTMENT INCOME DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD.

ACCRUAL

OF INCOME IS SUSPENDED ON NON-SECURITIZED FIXED MATURITIES OR MORTGAGE LOANS THAT ARE IN DEFAULT, OR ON WHICH IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AS

SCHEDULED. INTEREST INCOME ON INVESTMENTS IN DEFAULT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED. INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET THAT WERE NOT INCOME-PRODUCING FOR THE

PRECEDING 12 MONTHS WERE NOT MATERIAL.

FOR

FIXED MATURITIES WHERE THE COMPANY RECORDS AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, A DETERMINATION IS MADE AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND WHETHER THE

COMPANY EXPECTS A RECOVERY IN THE VALUE. FOR FIXED MATURITIES WHERE THE COMPANY EXPECTS A RECOVERY IN VALUE, NOT NECESSARILY TO PAR, THE CONSTANT EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IS

UTILIZED AND THE INVESTMENT IS AMORTIZED TO THE EXPECTED RECOVERY AMOUNT.

INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF PRETAX REVENUES BASED UPON SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE

INVESTMENTS SOLD ON THE TRADE DATE. INCLUDED IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON INVESTED ASSETS OTHER THAN THOSE

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AS DESCRIBED IN THE "INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS" SECTION THAT FOLLOWS.

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WHEN AN INVESTED ASSET'S VALUE DECLINES BELOW COST, ADJUSTED FOR ACCRETION, AMORTIZATION AND

PREVIOUS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS (NEW COST BASIS), AND IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. SOME OF THE FACTORS

CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE: (1) THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO RETAIN THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF

TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR AN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN VALUE; (2) THE RECOVERABILITY OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES, OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; (3) THE

LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN AMORTIZED COST FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES, OR COST FOR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND (4) THE FINANCIAL CONDITION,

NEAR-TERM AND LONG-TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE ISSUER, INCLUDING THE RELEVANT INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND TRENDS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF RATING AGENCY ACTIONS AND OFFERING PRICES. WHEN THE

COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN INVESTED ASSET IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, THE INVESTED ASSET IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE, AND THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS INCLUDED IN

EARNINGS AS A REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSS. THE FAIR VALUE THEN BECOMES THE NEW COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT, AND ANY SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE, OTHER THAN AMOUNTS ACCRETED TO THE EXPECTED

RECOVERY AMOUNT, ARE RECOGNIZED AT DISPOSITION. DUE TO THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S ANALYSIS AND ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ALONG WITH THE JUDGMENT THAT MUST BE APPLIED IN THE ANALYSIS, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANY COULD REACH A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPAIR A SECURITY IF IT HAD ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE INVESTEE. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

INVESTEE'S ABILITY TO MEET FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE COMPANY DETERMINED DURING ITS ANALYSIS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO A DIFFERENT IMPAIRMENT CONCLUSION IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES A REALIZED LOSS WHEN IMPAIRMENT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY EVEN IF A DECISION TO SELL AN INVESTED ASSET HAS NOT BEEN MADE. WHEN

THE COMPANY HAS DECIDED TO SELL A TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTED ASSET AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTED ASSET TO FULLY RECOVER

PRIOR TO THE EXPECTED TIME OF SALE, THE INVESTED ASSET IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DECISION TO SELL IS MADE.

THE

COMPANY'S PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING AND REVIEWING INVESTED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENTS DURING ANY QUARTER INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING.



IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE POSSIBLE INDICATIONS OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF ALL INVESTMENTS WITH GROSS UNREALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES THAT HAVE FAIR VALUES LESS THAN 80% OF COST;



REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF ANY OTHER INVESTMENTS BASED ON THE INVESTEE'S CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, NEAR-TERM RECOVERY PROSPECTS, THE OUTLOOK

FOR THE BUSINESS SECTORS IN WHICH THE INVESTEE OPERATES AND OTHER FACTORS (IN ADDITION TO REVIEWING INVESTMENTS WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF LESS THAN 80% OF COST);



CONSIDERATION OF EVIDENTIAL MATTER, INCLUDING AN EVALUATION OF FACTORS OR TRIGGERS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT CAUSE INDIVIDUAL

INVESTMENTS TO QUALIFY AS HAVING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS; AND



DETERMINATION OF THE STATUS OF EACH ANALYZED INVESTMENT AS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY OR NOT, WITH

DOCUMENTATION OF THE RATIONALE FOR THE DECISION.

SALES OF TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INVESTED ASSETS

THE COMPANY MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, SELL INVESTED ASSETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE THAT WERE CONSIDERED TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED

AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. SUCH SALES ARE GENERALLY DUE TO EVENTS OCCURRING SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET DATE THAT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S INTENT OR ABILITY TO HOLD AN INVESTED ASSET.

THE TYPES OF EVENTS THAT MAY RESULT IN A SALE INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO THE INVESTED ASSET, SIGNIFICANT UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN AN INDIVIDUAL

SUBSIDIARY'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES

AN INVESTMENT IN A FIXED MATURITY OR EQUITY SECURITY WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR SALE IS IMPAIRED IF ITS FAIR VALUE FALLS BELOW ITS COST OR

NEW COST BASIS, AND THE DECLINE IS CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. A FIXED MATURITY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED IF IT IS PROBABLE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SECURITY'S CONTRACTUAL TERMS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE THE INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY, OR THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO

RECOVER ITS COST OVER A FORECASTED RECOVERY PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY, FOR CERTAIN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS WITH CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS (INCLUDING ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), THE COMPANY UPDATES ITS BEST

ESTIMATE OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OVER THE LIFE OF THE SECURITY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSET AND THE PRESENT

VALUE OF THE ASSET'S CASH FLOWS ESTIMATED AT THE CURRENT FINANCIAL REPORTING DATE ARE LESS THAN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE (OR PREVIOUS FINANCIAL REPORTING

DATE), THEN AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED AND THE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSET IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE. FOR FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS WHERE FAIR VALUE

IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE COMPANY DID NOT REACH A DECISION TO IMPAIR, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD SUCH INVESTMENTS TO A PROJECTED RECOVERY IN VALUE,

WHICH MAY NOT BE UNTIL MATURITY. EQUITY SECURITIES ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED WHEN IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOVER ITS COST OVER A FORECASTED

RECOVERY PERIOD.

FOR

SECURITIES EXPECTED TO BE SOLD, AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY TO RECOVER

PRIOR TO THE EXPECTED DATE OF SALE. FURTHER, FOR PUBLIC SECURITIES MANAGED BY EXTERNAL MANAGERS, THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSERT THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITY TO RECOVERY AND, THEREFORE,

CONSIDERS THE SECURITIES IMPAIRED WHEN FAIR VALUE IS BELOW THE CARRYING VALUE AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, THE COMPANY OBTAINS INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS. IN

ADDITION, THE CARRYING VALUE OF ALL REAL ESTATE PROPERTY IS REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE. THE REVIEW FOR IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERS THE VALUATION FROM THE INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL, WHEN APPLICABLE, AND INCORPORATES AN ESTIMATE OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE

USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF THE EXPECTED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY.

THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS MEASURED AS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

MORTGAGE LOANS

A

MORTGAGE LOAN IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST AMOUNTS DUE. FOR MORTGAGE LOANS

THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED, A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY

USES INTEREST RATES REFLECTING THE CURRENT REAL ESTATE FINANCING MARKET RETURNS. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPAIRED MORTGAGE LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007.

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES

EXTERNALLY

MANAGED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT BY THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER AND THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. INTERNALLY MANAGED VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC AND

PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY BY THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER REVIEW AND CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN

DETERMINING THE VALUATION OF THE INVESTMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



THE INVESTEE'S MOST RECENT FINANCING EVENTS;



AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER A FUNDAMENTAL DETERIORATION OR IMPROVEMENT HAS OCCURRED;



WHETHER THE INVESTEE'S PROGRESS HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE OR LESS THAN EXPECTED;



WHETHER OR NOT THE VALUATIONS HAVE IMPROVED OR DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE INVESTEE'S MARKET SECTOR;



WHETHER OR NOT THE EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER AND THE COMPANY BELIEVE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE INVESTEE WILL NEED FINANCING

WITHIN SIX MONTHS AT A LOWER PRICE THAN THE COMPANY'S CARRYING VALUE; AND



WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR

RECOVERY, ENABLING THE COMPANY TO RECEIVE VALUE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN ITS COST.

AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF, BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER ALL OF ITS COST OF AN INDIVIDUAL HOLDING.

THE QUARTERLY VALUATION PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY TO FREQUENTLY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THOSE INVESTED ASSETS, PAYING

PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO EVENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS.

OTHER INVESTMENTS EXCLUDING VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES

INCLUDED

IN OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, INVESTMENTS IN HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT GENERALLY REPORT

INVESTMENTS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COMPANY USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT NO LESS FREQUENTLY

THAN QUARTERLY AND MONITORS THE PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT

THE

YEAR THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MANAGERS/GENERAL PARTNERS. IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF AN IMPAIRMENT OF A PARTNERSHIP'S INVESTMENTS AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE

PARTNERSHIP'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IT WILL RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT BY RECORDING A REDUCTION IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH A CORRESPONDING CHARGE TO NET INVESTMENT INCOME.

SECURITIES LENDING

THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH IT GENERATES NET INVESTMENT INCOME BY LENDING CERTAIN OF ITS

INVESTMENTS TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. BORROWERS OF THESE SECURITIES PROVIDE COLLATERAL EQUAL TO AT LEAST 102% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LOANED SECURITIES PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST.

THIS COLLATERAL IS HELD BY A THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN, AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE COLLATERAL ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THE INSTITUTION BORROWING THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES IS IN DEFAULT UNDER

THE LENDING AGREEMENT. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RECEIPT OF THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE THIRD-PARTY CUSTODIAN OR THE OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE COLLATERAL. THE LOANED SECURITIES

REMAIN A RECORDED ASSET OF THE COMPANY. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY BEGAN ACCEPTING ONLY CASH AS COLLATERAL FOR SECURITIES ON LOAN AND RESTRICTED THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT CASH WAS

INVESTED.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS ARE ESTIMATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM LIABILITY. THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ONGOING REVIEW OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING, LENGTH OF COLLECTION

PERIODS, CHANGES IN REINSURER CREDIT STANDING, DISPUTES, APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. AMOUNTS DEEMED TO

BE UNCOLLECTIBLE, INCLUDING AMOUNTS DUE FROM KNOWN INSOLVENT REINSURERS, ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. ANY SUBSEQUENT COLLECTIONS OF

AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF ARE REPORTED AS PART OF CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. THE COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE

ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

AMOUNTS WHICH VARY WITH AND ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION OF NEW INSURANCE CONTRACTS, CONSISTING OF COMMISSIONS AND

PREMIUM-RELATED TAXES, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED PRO RATA OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS IN WHICH THE RELATED PREMIUMS ARE EARNED. DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS ARE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE

RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE INCOME AND, IF NOT, ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. FUTURE INVESTMENT INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RELATED PREMIUMS IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MEASURING THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THIS ASSET. ALL OTHER ACQUISITION EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED.

CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

UNDER CERTAIN WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE FEATURES, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO PAY THE CLAIMANT FOR THE

FULL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM. THE COMPANY IS SUBSEQUENTLY REIMBURSED BY THE POLICYHOLDER FOR THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. THESE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED ON A GROSS BASIS

IN

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN CONTRACTHOLDER PAYABLES AND CONTRACTHOLDER RECEIVABLES, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS A REVIEW, ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS, OF GOODWILL HELD BY THE REPORTING UNITS WHICH ARE THE COMPANY'S THREE

OPERATING AND REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: BUSINESS INSURANCE; FINANCIAL, PROFESSIONAL & INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE; AND PERSONAL INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS AND

COMPARES IT TO THEIR CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL.

IF THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEED THEIR FAIR VALUE, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS CALCULATED AND GOODWILL IS ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.

IN

2008, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FROM A MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS MODEL TO A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL. THIS CHANGE WAS MADE

AS A RESULT OF THE EFFECTS OF A SEVERE DISRUPTION OF THE CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT CAUSED DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS OF THE

COMPANY AND THE OBSERVED MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS OF ITS COMPETITORS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL IS AN INCOME APPROACH TO VALUATION THAT IS BASED ON A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS FOR DERIVING A CURRENT

FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS AND IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL RELIES ON THE COMPANY'S ASSUMPTIONS OF ITS

FUTURE OPERATING EARNINGS, DISCOUNTED UTILIZING AN ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANY'S COST OF EQUITY. OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY THE COMPANY ARE ALSO REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST

AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASSET AS INDEFINITE-LIVED IS REASSESSED, AND AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE FINITE USEFUL LIFE ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A FINITE USEFUL LIFE IS REGULARLY

REVIEWED FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT IN VALUE. IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE FROM ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND IS MEASURED AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

THE

COMPANY'S REVIEW DID NOT RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF ITS INDEFINITE-LIVED OR FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES REPRESENT ESTIMATES FOR BOTH REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CLAIMS INCURRED AND RELATED EXPENSES.

THE RESERVES ARE ADJUSTED REGULARLY BASED UPON EXPERIENCE. INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ARE CERTAIN RESERVES DISCOUNTED TO THE PRESENT

VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE LIABILITIES FOR LOSSES FOR MOST LONG-TERM DISABILITY PAYMENTS UNDER WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXCESS INSURANCE,

WHICH TOTALED $2.25 BILLION AND $2.09 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 5% AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007. RESERVES

TOTALING $33 MILLION FOR CERTAIN ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 WERE DISCOUNTED USING A RATE OF 7%. NO RESERVES FOR SUCH BUSINESS WERE DISCOUNTED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008.

IN

DETERMINING CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES, THE COMPANY PERFORMS A CONTINUING REVIEW OF ITS OVERALL POSITION, ITS RESERVING TECHNIQUES AND ITS REINSURANCE. THE RESERVES

ARE ALSO

REVIEWED

REGULARLY BY QUALIFIED ACTUARIES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. THESE RESERVES REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE COST OF ALL INCURRED CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. SINCE THE RESERVES ARE

BASED ON ESTIMATES, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN SUCH RESERVES. THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SUCH ESTIMATED RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH

THE ESTIMATES ARE CHANGED. SUCH CHANGES IN ESTIMATES COULD OCCUR IN A FUTURE PERIOD AND MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN SUCH PERIOD.

OTHER LIABILITIES

INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IS THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITY FOR GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER

INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. THE LIABILITY FOR EXPECTED STATE GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER PREMIUM-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE COMPANY WRITES OR BECOMES OBLIGATED TO WRITE OR RENEW THE

PREMIUMS ON WHICH THE ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE BASED. THE LIABILITY FOR LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE RELATED LOSSES ARE INCURRED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

THE COMPANY HAD A LIABILITY OF $375 MILLION AND $278 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR GUARANTY FUND AND OTHER INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS AND RELATED RECOVERABLES OF $11 MILLION AT

BOTH DATES. THE LIABILITY FOR SUCH ASSESSMENTS AND THE RELATED RECOVERABLES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED FOR THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. THE LOSS-BASED ASSESSMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PAID OVER A PERIOD

RANGING FROM ONE YEAR TO THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF CERTAIN WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMANTS AND THE RECOVERIES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME.

DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006. POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS ARE ACCRUED AGAINST EARNINGS USING BEST AVAILABLE ESTIMATES OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID. THE LIABILITY ACCRUED FOR POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS

TOTALED $45 MILLION AND $39 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

TREASURY STOCK

TREASURY STOCK REPRESENTS THE COST OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH STOCK REPRESENTS AUTHORIZED AND UNISSUED SHARES OF

THE COMPANY UNDER THE MINNESOTA BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT.

ACCURACY/CONFIDENCE FOR EXPOSURES HAVING SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. WHEN A YEAR OF ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, A REINSURANCE CONTRACT (THE "REINSURANCE TO CLOSE" OR RITC) IS ENTERED INTO WITH A SUBSEQUENT YEAR

OF ACCOUNT (NORMALLY THE FOLLOWING YEAR OF ACCOUNT) IN CONSIDERATION FOR WHICH ALL SUBSEQUENT UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS RESULTING FROM THE CLOSING YEAR AND ALL PREVIOUS YEARS REINSURED THEREIN ARE

BROUGHT FORWARD TO (ACCEPTED BY) THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR OF ACCOUNT.

THE

AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS RECEIVED IN AN RITC IS EQUAL TO THE ACCEPTED CLAIMS INCLUDING INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED (IBNR) CLAIMS AND IS UNDISCOUNTED FOR THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY.

ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NO GAIN OR LOSS AT THE TIME THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ACQUIRED AND RECOGNIZED BY THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR OF ACCOUNT. IN ADDITION, THERE IS NO IMPACT ON REPORTED PREMIUMS AND

LOSSES AS A RESULT OF AN RITC TRANSACTION.

SEGMENT. FOR INVESTABLE FUNDS, A BENCHMARK INVESTMENT YIELD IS DEVELOPED THAT REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE LOSS RESERVES' FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME THE

LOSSES WERE INCURRED AND

A+ RATED CORPORATE DEBT INSTRUMENT YIELDS. FOR CAPITAL, A BENCHMARK INVESTMENT YIELD IS DEVELOPED THAT REFLECTS THE AVERAGE YIELD ON THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE BENCHMARK INVESTMENT YIELDS ARE

APPLIED TO EACH SEGMENT'S INVESTABLE FUNDS AND CAPITAL, RESPECTIVELY, TO PRODUCE A TOTAL NOTIONAL INVESTMENT INCOME BY SEGMENT. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL NET INVESTMENT INCOME IS ALLOCATED TO EACH SEGMENT

IN PROPORTION TO THE RESPECTIVE SEGMENT'S NOTIONAL INVESTMENT INCOME TO TOTAL NOTIONAL INVESTMENT INCOME. THERE ARE CERTAIN LEGAL ENTITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY THAT ARE DEDICATED TO SPECIFIC REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE INVESTED ASSETS AND RELATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME FROM THESE LEGAL ENTITIES ARE REPORTED IN THE APPLICABLE BUSINESS SEGMENT AND ARE NOT ALLOCATED.

THE

COST OF THE COMPANY'S CATASTROPHE TREATY PROGRAM IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S CEDED PREMIUMS AND IS ALLOCATED AMONG REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF ACTUAL MARKET

REINSURANCE PRICING USING EXPECTED LOSSES CALCULATED BY THE COMPANY'S CATASTROPHE MODEL, ADJUSTED FOR ANY EXPERIENCE ADJUSTMENTS.

RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE

184

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

3. INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

INCLUDED

IN "ALL OTHER CORPORATE BONDS" IN THE TABLES ABOVE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY $258 MILLION OF THESE SECURITIES, OR THE LOANS BACKING SUCH SECURITIES, CONTAINED

GUARANTEES BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OR A GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE AND $20 MILLION WERE COMPRISED OF CANADIAN NON-GUARANTEED SECURITIES. THE AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF

THE $508 MILLION OF NON-GUARANTEED SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS "AAA," AND 93% OF THOSE SECURITIES WERE ISSUED IN 2004 AND PRIOR YEARS. THE CMBS PORTFOLIO IS SUPPORTED

BY LOANS THAT ARE DIVERSIFIED ACROSS ECONOMIC SECTORS AND GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS.

THE

COMPANY MAKES INVESTMENTS IN RESIDENTIAL COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS) THAT TYPICALLY HAVE HIGH CREDIT QUALITY, OFFER GOOD LIQUIDITY AND ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE AN

ADVANTAGE IN YIELD COMPARED TO U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO PURCHASE CMO TRANCHES WHICH OFFER THE MOST FAVORABLE RETURN GIVEN THE RISKS INVOLVED. ONE SIGNIFICANT

RISK EVALUATED IS PREPAYMENT SENSITIVITY. WHILE PREPAYMENT RISK (EITHER SHORTENING OR LENGTHENING OF DURATION) AND ITS EFFECT ON TOTAL RETURN CANNOT BE FULLY CONTROLLED, PARTICULARLY WHEN INTEREST

RATES MOVE DRAMATICALLY, THE INVESTMENT PROCESS GENERALLY FAVORS SECURITIES THAT CONTROL THIS RISK WITHIN EXPECTED INTEREST RATE RANGES. THE COMPANY DOES INVEST IN OTHER TYPES OF CMO TRANCHES IF A

CAREFUL ASSESSMENT INDICATES A FAVORABLE RISK/RETURN TRADEOFF. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PURCHASE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN CMOS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY HELD CMOS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $2.84 BILLION AND $3.59 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY (IN ADDITION

TO THE CMBS SECURITIES OF $766 MILLION AND $935 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DESCRIBED ABOVE). APPROXIMATELY 35% AND 31% OF THE COMPANY'S CMO HOLDINGS ARE GUARANTEED BY OR FULLY COLLATERALIZED

BY SECURITIES ISSUED BY GNMA, FNMA OR FHLMC AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HELD $3.22 BILLION AND $3.52 BILLION OF GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC

(EXCLUDING FHA PROJECT LOANS WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITH CMBS) MORTGAGE-BACKED PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE

AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF ALL OF THE ABOVE SECURITIES WAS "AAA" AT BOTH DATES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY HAD $8 MILLION AND $1.99 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES ON LOAN AS PART OF A TRI-PARTY LENDING

AGREEMENT. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY BEGAN ACCEPTING ONLY CASH AS COLLATERAL FOR SECURITIES ON LOAN AND RESTRICTED THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT CASH WAS INVESTED.

PROCEEDS

$269 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH THIRD PARTIES TO BE USED AS COLLATERAL TO SECURE VARIOUS LIABILITIES ON BEHALF OF INSUREDS, CEDANTS AND

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS IN WHICH DERIVATIVES (FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS) HEDGE THE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE. THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE HEDGING THE NET INVESTMENT, INCLUDING ANY FORWARD PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT, IS REFLECTED

IN THE ACCUMULATED OTHER CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES AS PART OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE AMOUNT INCLUDED IN

CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES WAS A LOSS OF $2 MILLION IN 2008 AND A GAIN OF $1 MILLION IN 2007. WITH REGARD TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS IN 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY HAD NO

REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES IN EITHER YEAR.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN FAS 157. THE FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON THE INPUTS USED

IN VALUATION AND GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND REQUIRES THAT OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED IN THE VALUATIONS WHEN AVAILABLE. THE DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN

THE FAS 157 HIERARCHY IS BASED ON WHETHER THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS INTO THE VALUATION ARE OBSERVABLE. IN DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY IN WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS DISCLOSED, THE HIGHEST

PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN

ACTIVE MARKETS AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT MARKET ASSUMPTIONS. THE THREE LEVELS OF THE HIERARCHY ARE AS FOLLOWS.



LEVEL 1UNADJUSTED

QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY

TO ACCESS.



LEVEL 2QUOTED

PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS; OR VALUATIONS BASED ON MODELS WHERE THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE (E.G., INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULT RATES, LOSS

SEVERITIES, ETC.) OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.



LEVEL 3VALUATIONS

BASED ON MODELS WHERE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT THE COMPANY'S

OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE INPUTS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT AT WHICH THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE EXCHANGED IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE, UNRELATED WILLING PARTIES, I.E., NOT IN A FORCED TRANSACTION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MAY DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED IF THE

SECURITY WAS SOLD IN AN IMMEDIATE SALE, E.G., A FORCED TRANSACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUATION OF FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS IS MORE SUBJECTIVE WHEN MARKETS ARE LESS LIQUID DUE TO THE LACK OF MARKET

BASED INPUTS, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (I.E., THE CARRYING AMOUNT) OF AN INVESTMENT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE PRICE AT WHICH AN ACTUAL TRANSACTION WOULD OCCUR.

FOR

INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, THE COMPANY USES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDES THESE PRICES IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN

LEVEL 1 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE COMPANY RECEIVES THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES FROM A THIRD PARTY, NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICE (PRICING SERVICE). WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE UNAVAILABLE,

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS MAINLY FOR ITS FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES PROVIDED FROM THIS PRICING SERVICE ARE

INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND AN ESTIMATE FROM A PRICING SERVICE ARE UNAVAILABLE, THE COMPANY PRODUCES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE

BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION TECHNIQUES,

WHICH, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, WILL RENDER THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE AS LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3. THE COMPANY BASES ALL OF ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR ASSETS ON

THE BID PRICE AS IT REPRESENTS WHAT A THIRD PARTY MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY IN AN ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION.

193

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)

FIXED MATURITIES

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 99% OF ITS FIXED MATURITIES. THE PRICING

SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. SINCE FIXED MATURITIES OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES GENERALLY DO NOT TRADE ON A DAILY

BASIS, THE PRICING SERVICE PREPARES ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR THESE SECURITIES USING ITS PROPRIETARY PRICING APPLICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE AVAILABLE RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, BENCHMARK

CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR GROUPINGS AND MATRIX PRICING. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRICING SERVICE USES AN OPTION ADJUSTED SPREAD MODEL TO DEVELOP PREPAYMENT AND INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS.

THE

PRICING SERVICE EVALUATES EACH ASSET CLASS BASED ON RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, RELEVANT CREDIT INFORMATION, PERCEIVED MARKET MOVEMENTS AND SECTOR NEWS. THE MARKET INPUTS UTILIZED

IN THE PRICING EVALUATION, LISTED IN THE APPROXIMATE ORDER OF PRIORITY, INCLUDE: BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES, BROKER/DEALER QUOTES, ISSUER SPREADS, TWO-SIDED MARKETS, BENCHMARK

SECURITIES, BIDS, OFFERS, REFERENCE DATA, AND INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC EVENTS. THE EXTENT OF THE USE OF EACH MARKET INPUT DEPENDS ON THE ASSET CLASS AND THE MARKET CONDITIONS. DEPENDING ON THE SECURITY,

THE PRIORITY OF THE USE OF INPUTS MAY CHANGE OR SOME MARKET INPUTS MAY NOT BE RELEVANT. FOR SOME SECURITIES ADDITIONAL INPUTS MAY BE NECESSARY.

THE

PRICING SERVICE UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED THAT THEY WILL ONLY PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IF THERE IS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE INFORMATION TO PRODUCE A VALUATION. IF

THE PRICING SERVICE DISCONTINUES PRICING AN INVESTMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE USING SOME OF THE SAME METHODOLOGIES AS THE PRICING SERVICE, BUT WOULD HAVE

TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS FOR MARKET BASED INPUTS THAT ARE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF MOST FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION RATHER THAN MARKET QUOTES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH FIXED

MATURITIES, OTHER THAN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, PROVIDED BY THE PRICING SERVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 2 OF THE HIERARCHY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF U.S. TREASURY

SECURITIES IS INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1 AS THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON UNADJUSTED MARKET PRICES.

THE

COMPANY HOLDS PRIVATELY PLACED CORPORATE BONDS AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL MATRIX THAT IS BASED ON MARKET INFORMATION REGARDING INTEREST RATES,

CREDIT SPREADS AND LIQUIDITY. THE UNDERLYING SOURCE DATA FOR CALCULATING THE MATRIX OF CREDIT SPREADS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE ARE THE MERRILL LYNCH U.S. CORPORATE INDEX AND THE MERRILL

LYNCH HIGH YIELD BB RATED INDEX. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF THESE CORPORATE BONDS IN LEVEL 2 SINCE ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE MARKET OBSERVABLE. AS MANY OF THESE

SECURITIES ARE ISSUED BY PUBLIC COMPANIES, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE COMPANIES' PUBLICLY TRADED DEBT TO TEST THE VALIDITY OF THE INTERNAL PRICING

MATRIX.

WHILE

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE INCLUDED IN LEVEL 2, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL NUMBER OF MUNICIPAL BONDS WHICH ARE NOT VALUED BY THE PRICING SERVICE

AND ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BONDS USING AN INTERNAL PRICING MATRIX WITH SOME UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUATION. DUE TO THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF OBSERVABLE MARKET

INFORMATION, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THESE PARTICULAR BONDS IN LEVEL 3. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HOLDS A SMALL AMOUNT OF FIXED MATURITIES THAT HAVE CHARACTERISTICS

THAT MAKE THEM UNSUITABLE FOR MATRIX PRICING. FOR THESE FIXED MATURITIES, THE COMPANY OBTAINS A QUOTE FROM A BROKER (TYPICALLY A MARKET

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)

MAKER).

DUE TO THE DISCLAIMERS ON THE QUOTES THAT INDICATE THAT THE PRICE IS INDICATIVE ONLY, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN LEVEL 3.

EQUITIESPUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED

FOR PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS, THE COMPANY RECEIVES PRICES FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRICING SERVICE THAT ARE BASED ON

OBSERVABLE MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND INCLUDES THESE ESTIMATES IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 1. INFREQUENTLY, CURRENT MARKET QUOTES IN ACTIVE MARKETS ARE UNAVAILABLE FOR CERTAIN NONREDEEMABLE

PREFERRED STOCKS HELD BY THE COMPANY. IN THESE INSTANCES, THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE FROM THE PRICING SERVICE THAT PROVIDES FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR THE COMPANY'S FIXED MATURITIES.

THE SERVICE UTILIZES SOME OF THE SAME METHODOLOGIES TO PRICE THE NONREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS AS IT DOES FOR THE FIXED MATURITIES. THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE ESTIMATE IN THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN

LEVEL 2.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES

THE

COMPANY HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND NON-PUBLIC COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES, WITH A FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE OF

$224 MILLION, REPORTED IN OTHER INVESTMENTS, WHERE THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE IS DETERMINED EITHER INTERNALLY OR BY AN EXTERNAL FUND MANAGER BASED ON RECENT FILINGS, OPERATING RESULTS, BALANCE

SHEET STABILITY, GROWTH AND OTHER BUSINESS AND MARKET SECTOR FUNDAMENTALS. THE COMPANY HOLDS ONE PRIVATE COMMON STOCK WITH A FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE OF $162 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, FOR

WHICH THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY APPRAISER ON BEHALF OF THE INVESTEE AND ADJUSTED FOR A LIQUIDITY DISCOUNT WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE RESTRICTION ON THE COMMON

STOCK. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN THESE VALUATIONS, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE FOR ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 IN THE AMOUNT

DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 3.

DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES GENERALLY TO HEDGE ITS NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS

NON-PUBLIC WARRANTS IN A PUBLIC COMPANY AND HAS CONVERTIBLE BONDS CONTAINING EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS THAT ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY FROM THE HOST BOND CONTRACT. FOR THE DERIVATIVES USED

TO HEDGE THE NET INVESTMENT OF A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY, THE COMPANY USES QUOTED MARKET PRICES TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE, WHICH WAS IN A LIABILITY POSITION OF

APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, IN LEVEL 1. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE FOR THE WARRANTS USING AN OPTION PRICING MODEL WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS. BECAUSE

THE WARRANTS ARE NOT MARKET TRADED AND INFORMATION CONCERNING MARKET PARTICIPANTS IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE COMPANY INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE OF $87 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 IN

THE AMOUNT DISCLOSED IN LEVEL 3OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY SEPARATELY VALUES THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS AND INCLUDES THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE IN LEVEL 2.

THE

CARRYING VALUES OF $718 MILLION AND $885 MILLION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS APPROXIMATED THEIR FAIR VALUES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

ALSO APPROXIMATED THEIR FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING VARIOUS METHODS INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AS APPROPRIATE FOR THE VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE

CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS $6.18 BILLION AND $5.44 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESPECTIVE TOTALS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 WERE $6.24 BILLION AND $6.06 BILLION. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PRICING SERVICE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 96% OF ITS DEBT, OTHER THAN

COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE PRICING SERVICE UTILIZES MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR DEBT THAT HAVE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. WHEN QUOTED PRICES ARE UNAVAILABLE, THE PRICING SERVICE PREPARES ESTIMATES OF FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR THESE SECURITIES USING ITS PROPRIETARY PRICING APPLICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE AVAILABLE RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, BENCHMARK CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR

GROUPINGS AND MATRIX PRICING.

FOR

SOME DEBT SECURITIES, PRIMARILY THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES, THE PRICING SERVICE IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. FOR THESE SECURITIES, THE COMPANY UTILIZES

PRICING ESTIMATES FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BROKER/DEALER TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. THE BROKER/DEALER PREPARES ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR THESE SECURITIES USING ITS PROPRIETARY PRICING APPLICATIONS

WHICH INCLUDE RELEVANT MARKET INFORMATION, BENCHMARK CURVES, BENCHMARKING OF LIKE SECURITIES, SECTOR GROUPINGS AND MATRIX PRICING. IF ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE UNAVAILABLE FROM THE PRICING SERVICE

OR THE BROKER/DEALER, THE COMPANY PRODUCES AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE BASED ON INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION TECHNIQUES WHICH ARE BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY AND INCORPORATES ALL

AVAILABLE RELEVANT OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS. THE COMPANY BASES ALL OF ITS ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE FOR ITS DEBT ON THE BID PRICE AS IT REPRESENTS WHAT A THIRD PARTY MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD BE WILLING

TO PAY IN AN ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER INCLUDED IN DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 APPROXIMATED ITS BOOK VALUE BECAUSE OF ITS SHORT-TERM NATURE.

5. REINSURANCE

THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF ASSUMED AND CEDED REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. ASSUMED REINSURANCE REFERS TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS

THAT OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE UNDERWRITTEN. CEDED REINSURANCE INVOLVES TRANSFERRING CERTAIN INSURANCE RISKS (ALONG WITH THE RELATED WRITTEN AND EARNED PREMIUMS) THE COMPANY HAS UNDERWRITTEN TO

OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO AGREE TO SHARE THESE RISKS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF CEDED REINSURANCE IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY, AT A COST, FROM VOLATILITY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT IT IS PREPARED TO

ACCEPT. REINSURANCE IS PLACED ON BOTH A QUOTA-SHARE AND EXCESS OF LOSS BASIS. CEDED REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT DISCHARGE THE COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY INSURER, EXCEPT FOR CASES INVOLVING A NOVATION.

INCLUDED

IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE CERTAIN AMOUNTS RELATED TO STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS. STRUCTURED SETTLEMENTS COMPRISE ANNUITIES PURCHASED FROM VARIOUS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

SETTLE CERTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL INJURY CLAIMS, OF WHICH WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. IN CASES WHERE THE COMPANY DID NOT RECEIVE A RELEASE FROM THE CLAIMANT, THE

STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT IS INCLUDED IN REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AS THE COMPANY RETAINS THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY TO THE CLAIMANT. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY FAILS TO MAKE THE REQUIRED

ANNUITY PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS.

THE

COMPANY EVALUATES AND MONITORS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS UNDER VOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER

INSOLVENCIES. IN ADDITION, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN COVERAGE DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS. SOME OF THESE DISPUTES COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND

ARBITRATIONS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST THE REINSURERS TO DETERMINE THE COMPANY'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS.

THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND STRATEGIES TO MANAGE REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS AND DISPUTES.

THE

COMPANY IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS INVOLUNTARY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS THROUGH ASSUMED REINSURANCE, PRINCIPALLY WITH REGARD TO RESIDUAL MARKET MECHANISMS IN WORKERS'

COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE. THE COMPANY PROVIDES SERVICES FOR SEVERAL OF THESE INVOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS ("MANDATORY POOLS AND ASSOCIATIONS") UNDER WHICH IT WRITES SUCH RESIDUAL MARKET

BUSINESS DIRECTLY, THEN CEDES 100% OF THIS BUSINESS TO THE MANDATORY POOL. SUCH SERVICING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ARRANGED TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK TO THE COMPANY, AS ANY CEDED BALANCES ARE JOINTLY BACKED BY

ALL THE POOL MEMBERS.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A GENERAL CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY WITH UNAFFILIATED REINSURERS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES. IN ADDITION TO THE COVERAGE

PROVIDED UNDER THIS TREATY, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES A CATASTROPHE BOND PROGRAM, AS WELL AS A NORTHEAST CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE TREATY, TO PROTECT AGAINST LOSSES RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHES IN THE

NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.

CERTAIN

OF THE ASSUMED REINSURANCE CONTRACTS THAT THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO WITH NON-AFFILIATED COMPANIES ON AN EXCESS OF LOSS BASIS DO NOT TRANSFER INSURANCE RISK. THESE

CONTRACTS, WHICH TOTALED $46 MILLION AND $165 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTING AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LIABILITIES

IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACTS

ON NOVEMBER 26, 2002, THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002 (THE TERRORISM ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW AND ESTABLISHED

THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM), A TEMPORARY FEDERAL PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THAT PROVIDED FOR A SYSTEM OF SHARED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN

INSURED LOSSES RESULTING FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR COMMITTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN INTEREST. THE PROGRAM WAS SCHEDULED TO TERMINATE ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005 (THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT) WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW, REAUTHORIZING THE PROGRAM THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2007, WHILE REDUCING THE FEDERAL ROLE

UNDER THE PROGRAM. IN DECEMBER 2007, THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 WAS ENACTED INTO FEDERAL LAW, EXTENDING COVERAGE TO INCLUDE DOMESTIC ACTS OF TERRORISM AND

REAUTHORIZING THE PROGRAM THROUGH 2014. THE THREE ACTS ARE HEREINAFTER COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "THE ACTS."

IN

ORDER FOR A LOSS TO BE COVERED UNDER THE PROGRAM (SUBJECT LOSSES), THE LOSS MUST MEET CERTAIN AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUMS AND MUST BE THE RESULT OF AN EVENT THAT IS CERTIFIED AS

AN ACT OF TERRORISM BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. THE ANNUAL AGGREGATE INDUSTRY LOSS MINIMUM IS $100 MILLION THROUGH 2014. THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION CERTAIN OF

THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF INSURANCE: FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE, PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE, FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE, HEALTH OR LIFE INSURANCE, FLOOD INSURANCE, AND

REINSURANCE. THE TERRORISM EXTENSION ACT EXEMPTED FROM COVERAGE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL TYPES OF INSURANCE, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE, PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY (OTHER THAN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS'),

SURETY, BURGLARY AND THEFT, AND FARM-OWNERS MULTI-PERIL. IN THE CASE OF A WAR DECLARED BY CONGRESS, ONLY WORKERS' COMPENSATION LOSSES ARE COVERED BY THE ACTS. THE ACTS GENERALLY REQUIRE

THAT ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS LICENSED IN THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PROGRAM, A PARTICIPATING INSURER IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT FOR 85% OF SUBJECT LOSSES, AFTER AN INSURER DEDUCTIBLE, SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL CAP. THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT PERCENTAGE IS 85% THROUGH 2014.

THE

DEDUCTIBLE FOR ANY CALENDAR YEAR IS EQUAL TO 20% OF THE INSURER'S DIRECT EARNED PREMIUMS FOR COVERED LINES FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED DEDUCTIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM

IS $2.16 BILLION FOR 2009. THE ANNUAL CAP LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF AGGREGATE SUBJECT LOSSES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO $100 BILLION. ONCE SUBJECT LOSSES HAVE REACHED THE

$100 BILLION AGGREGATE DURING A PROGRAM YEAR, PARTICIPATING INSURERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM FOR ADDITIONAL COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES

FOR

THAT PROGRAM YEAR. THE COMPANY HAS HAD NO TERRORISM-RELATED LOSSES SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED. BECAUSE THE ACTS ARE RELATIVELY NEW AND THEIR INTERPRETATION IS UNTESTED, THERE MAY BE

UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW THEY WILL BE APPLIED TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. FURTHER, GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF TERRORISM LOSSES, AS WELL AS THE LIMITED TERRORISM COVERAGE IN THE

COMPANY'S OWN REINSURANCE PROGRAM, FUTURE LOSSES FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVOLVING NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL OR RADIOLOGICAL EVENTS, COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING

RESULTS,

FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR LIQUIDITY IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THIS TYPE OF CATASTROPHIC RISK BY MONITORING AND CONTROLLING TERRORISM RISK AGGREGATIONS TO THE BEST OF ITS

ABILITY.

THE

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT OF $191 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. AND TRAVELERS

PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. IN 2004 AND WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATE OF NOMINAL CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES (AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFORMITY WITH THE

ACQUIRER'S ACCOUNTING POLICY ON DISCOUNTING OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESERVES), EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERNS, THE APRIL 1, 2004 U.S. TREASURY SPOT RATE YIELD CURVE, A LEVERAGE RATIO ASSUMPTION

(RESERVES TO STATUTORY SURPLUS), AND A COST OF CAPITAL EXPRESSED AS A SPREAD OVER RISK-FREE RATES. THE METHOD USED CALCULATES A RISK ADJUSTMENT TO A RISK-FREE DISCOUNTED

RESERVE THAT WILL, IF RESERVES RUN OFF AS EXPECTED, PRODUCE RESULTS THAT YIELD THE ASSUMED COST-OF-CAPITAL ON THE CAPITAL SUPPORTING THE LOSS RESERVES. THE FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT IS REPORTED AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AND THE AMOUNTS MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACQUIRER'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AS

PART OF THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES. THE INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE RECOGNIZED INTO INCOME OVER THE EXPECTED PAYMENT PATTERN. BECAUSE THE TIME VALUE OF

MONEY AND THE RISK ADJUSTMENT (COST OF CAPITAL) COMPONENTS OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET RUN OFF AT DIFFERENT RATES, THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN INCOME MAY BE A NET BENEFIT IN SOME PERIODS AND A NET EXPENSE IN

OTHER PERIODS.

BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED LOSS DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT LINES. THE NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE GENERAL LIABILITY AND COMMERCIAL

MULTI-PERIL LINES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS ENHANCED RISK CONTROL, UNDERWRITING AND CLAIM PROCESS INITIATIVES. THE COMMERCIAL

PROPERTY PRODUCT LINE IMPROVEMENT OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN THE 2007 ACCIDENT YEAR AS A RESULT OF BETTER THAN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT FOR CERTAIN LARGE NATIONAL PROPERTY, NATIONAL PROGRAMS, AND OCEAN MARINE

CLAIM EXPOSURES AND LOWER THAN EXPECTED WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES DURING THE LAST HALF OF 2007, AS WELL AS FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IN CERTAIN LARGE INLAND MARINE CLAIM EXPOSURES AND IN CEDED RECOVERIES FOR

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY LARGE CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMMERCIAL MULTI-PERIL AND PROPERTY PRODUCT LINES' 2005 ACCIDENT YEAR RESULTS EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENT DUE TO THE LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT RELATING TO,

ACCIDENT YEAR NON-CATASTROPHE RELATED AND CATASTROPHE LOSSES. "DEMAND SURGE" REFERS TO SIGNIFICANT SHORT-TERM INCREASES IN BUILDING MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS DUE TO A SHARP

INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR THOSE MATERIALS AND SERVICES. THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LINE OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCED BETTER THAN EXPECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMPROVED LEGAL AND JUDICIAL

ENVIRONMENTS, CLAIM HANDLING INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON THE AUTOMOBILE LINE OF INSURANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN AUTO SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. THE RESERVE STRENGTHENING IN ASSUMED REINSURANCE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

CHANGES IN PROJECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT DRIVEN BY AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN THE CLAIM SETTLEMENT PATTERNS OF THE UNDERLYING CASUALTY EXPOSURES.

INJURY LOSS EXPERIENCE AND A DECLINE IN NON-CATASTROPHE LOSSES IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS, AND A REDUCTION IN LOSS ESTIMATES FOR THE 2005 HURRICANES. IN THE AUTOMOBILE

LINE OF BUSINESS, THE IMPROVEMENT WAS PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN CLAIM HANDLING PRACTICES. THESE CHANGES INCLUDED PRACTICES WHICH HAVE ALLOWED CASE RESERVES TO BE

ESTABLISHED MORE ACCURATELY EARLIER IN THE CLAIM SETTLEMENT PROCESS, THEREBY CHANGING HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. IN ADDITION, INDUSTRY AND COMPANY INITIATIVES TO FIGHT FRAUD IN SEVERAL

STATES LED TO A DECREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS AND A CHANGE IN HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. IN THE HOMEOWNERS AND OTHER LINE OF BUSINESS, FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT WAS

PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS, ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND FEWER SMALL-DOLLAR CLAIMS. THESE CHANGES ALSO RESULTED

IN A CHANGE IN HISTORICAL LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. IN ADDITION, NON-CATASTROPHE

AND OTHER LOSS EXPERIENCE WAS FAVORABLE DUE TO CONTINUED EVIDENCE OF A LESS THAN EXPECTED IMPACT FROM "DEMAND SURGE," WHICH REFERS TO SIGNIFICANT SHORT-TERM INCREASES IN

BUILDING MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS DUE TO A SHARP INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR THOSE MATERIALS AND SERVICES. INCLUDED IN NET FAVORABLE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 WAS A REDUCTION IN LOSS ESTIMATES

FOR CATASTROPHES INCURRED IN 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER THAN EXPECTED ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSE LOSSES RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY'S CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES INCLUDED $3.33 BILLION AND

$4.22 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS, NET OF REINSURANCE. IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF UNIONAMERICA, WHICH COMPRISED ITS UNITED

KINGDOM-BASED RUNOFF DIRECT INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BUSINESSES. INCLUDED IN THE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES TRANSFERRED TO THE PURCHASER WERE NET ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

OF $265 MILLION.

IT

IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CLAIMS DUE TO THE VAGARIES OF COURT COVERAGE DECISIONS, PLAINTIFFS' EXPANDED THEORIES OF LIABILITY, THE

RISKS INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE WHICH ARE SET FORTH BELOW.

ASBESTOS RESERVES.

BECAUSE EACH POLICYHOLDER PRESENTS DIFFERENT LIABILITY AND COVERAGE ISSUES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY REVIEWS THE

EXPOSURE PRESENTED

BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AT LEAST ANNUALLY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS REVIEW, THE COMPANY GENERALLY CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS

INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES; AN ANALYSIS OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY; THE JURISDICTIONS INVOLVED; PAST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CLAIM

ACTIVITY AND LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON PENDING CLAIMS; PAST SETTLEMENT VALUES OF SIMILAR CLAIMS; ALLOCATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE; POTENTIAL ROLE OF OTHER INSURANCE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF

NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ASBESTOS CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND APPLICABLE COVERAGE DEFENSES OR DETERMINATIONS, IF ANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION AS TO

WHETHER OR NOT AN ASBESTOS CLAIM IS A PRODUCTS/COMPLETED OPERATION CLAIM SUBJECT TO AN AGGREGATE LIMIT AND THE AVAILABLE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR THAT CLAIM.

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IN-DEPTH ASBESTOS CLAIM REVIEW. THE TRENDS OBSERVED OVER THE PAST THREE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY CONSISTENT.

THE TRENDS INCLUDE.



MORE STABLE PAYMENT TRENDS FOR A LARGE PROPORTION OF POLICYHOLDERS;



A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW CLAIMS RECEIVED;



A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LARGE ASBESTOS EXPOSURES CONFRONTING THE COMPANY DUE TO ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY;



FEWER AND LESS VOLATILE ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCIES; AND



THE ABSENCE OF NEW THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR NEW CLASSES OF DEFENDANTS.

WHILE

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE TRENDS INDICATE A REDUCTION IN THE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S OVERALL ASBESTOS EXPOSURE, THERE NONETHELESS REMAINS A HIGH DEGREE OF

UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EXPOSURE FROM ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

THE

HOME OFFICE AND FIELD OFFICE CATEGORIES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICYHOLDERS WITH ACTIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS, AGAIN EXPERIENCED AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN NEW CLAIM

FILINGS IN 2008.

THE

NUMBER OF POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING ASBESTOS CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE NUMBER TENDERING CLAIMS IN 2007. DEFENSE AND INDEMNITY COSTS IN THESE CATEGORIES REMAIN AT SIMILAR

LEVELS TO WHAT THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE LEVEL OF TRIAL ACTIVITY INVOLVING IMPAIRED INDIVIDUALS.

ON

JANUARY 29, 2009, THE COMPANY AND PPG INDUSTRIES, INC ("PPG"), ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY 30 OTHER INSURERS OF PPG, AGREED IN PRINCIPLE ON A MODIFIED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO

SETTLE ASBESTOS-RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO PPG. THE TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE MODIFIED THIRD AMENDED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

("AMENDED PLAN") PROPOSED AS PART OF THE PITTSBURGH CORNING CORP. ("PCC", WHICH IS 50% OWNED BY PPG) BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. PURSUANT TO THE PROPOSED AMENDED PLAN, WHICH WAS FILED ON JANUARY 30,

2009, PCC, ALONG WITH ENUMERATED OTHER COMPANIES (INCLUDING PPG AS WELL AS THE COMPANY AS A PARTICIPATING INSURER), ARE TO RECEIVE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY SECTION 524(G) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE

FROM CERTAIN ASBESTOS-RELATED BODILY INJURY CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO A PRIOR AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH PPG IN 2002 WHICH WAS CONTINGENT UPON FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE SECOND AMENDED

PLAN OF REORGANIZATION FOR PCC, BUT IN DECEMBER 2006, THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT DECLINED TO CONFIRM THAT PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. AS A RESULT OF THE DECEMBER 2006 RULING, THE COMPANY REMOVED

THE RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIOR AGREEMENT FROM THE STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT CATEGORY OF THE ASBESTOS RESERVE AND MADE A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE UNALLOCATED ASBESTOS IBNR RESERVE. UNDER THE

CURRENT AGREEMENT

IN PRINCIPLE, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO MAKE A SERIES OF PAYMENTS OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $620 MILLION TO THE TRUST TO BE CREATED UNDER THE AMENDED PLAN, OR IT

MAY ELECT TO MAKE A ONE-TIME DISCOUNTED PAYMENT, WHICH, AS OF JUNE 30, 2009, WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $430 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION AFTER REINSURANCE). THE

CURRENT AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH PPG IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE AMENDED PLAN, AND THE COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT UNTIL

ALL CONTINGENCIES ARE SATISFIED. THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE CONTINUE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE UNALLOCATED ASBESTOS IBNR RESERVE.

THE

COMPANY'S QUARTERLY ASBESTOS RESERVE REVIEW INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF EXPOSURE AND CLAIM PAYMENT PATTERNS BY POLICYHOLDER CATEGORY, AS WELL AS RECENT SETTLEMENTS, POLICYHOLDER

BANKRUPTCIES, JUDICIAL RULINGS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. DEVELOPING PAYMENT TRENDS AMONG POLICYHOLDERS IN THE HOME OFFICE, FIELD OFFICE AND ASSUMED AND INTERNATIONAL CATEGORIES ARE ALSO ANALYZED. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS HISTORICAL GROSS AND NET LOSS AND EXPENSE PAID EXPERIENCE, YEAR-BY-YEAR, TO ASSESS ANY EMERGING TRENDS, FLUCTUATIONS, OR CHARACTERISTICS

SUGGESTED BY THE AGGREGATE PAID ACTIVITY. FOR CERTAIN POLICYHOLDERS AN ESTIMATE OF THE GROSS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR INDEMNITY AND RELATED CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE IS DETERMINED, AND FOR THOSE

POLICYHOLDERS THE COMPANY CALCULATES, BY EACH POLICY YEAR, A CEDED REINSURANCE PROJECTION BASED ON ANY APPLICABLE FACULTATIVE AND TREATY REINSURANCE, PAST CEDED EXPERIENCE AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIONS.

CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL METHODS ARE NOT UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH ASBESTOS RESERVES NOR HAVE THE COMPANY'S EVALUATIONS RESULTED IN ANY WAY OF DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL AVERAGE ASBESTOS DEFENSE OR INDEMNITY

PAYMENT.

NET

ASBESTOS LOSSES AND EXPENSES PAID IN 2008 WERE $658 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $317 MILLION IN 2007. THE INCREASE IN NET PAID LOSSES WAS THE RESULT OF THE ACANDS PAYMENT IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008. EXCLUDING THE ACANDS SETTLEMENT, PAYMENTS IN 2008 WERE $293 MILLION. APPROXIMATELY 59% AND 20% OF TOTAL NET PAID LOSSES IN 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO

POLICYHOLDERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS LIMITING THE COMPANY'S LIABILITY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (CONTINUED)

THE

COMPANY RECORDED A $70 MILLION PRETAX INCREASE TO ASBESTOS RESERVES IN 2008. THE COMPANY RECORDED NO ASBESTOS RESERVE ADDITIONS IN 2007 AND RECORDED A PRETAX ASBESTOS RESERVE

ADDITION OF $155 MILLION IN 2006. THE 2008 INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATING ASBESTOS COVERAGE MATTERS AND A CHANGE IN ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR

CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDERS. THE INCREASE WAS NOT A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF THE UNDERLYING ASBESTOS ENVIRONMENT. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE $155 MILLION 2006

PRETAX RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE PROJECTED DEFENSE COSTS FOR TEN POLICYHOLDERS. THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAINDER OF THE RESERVE ADJUSTMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED LITIGATION

ACTIVITY AGAINST SMALLER, PERIPHERAL DEFENDANTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

IN ESTABLISHING ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY EACH POLICYHOLDER AND

THE ANTICIPATED

COST OF RESOLUTION, IF ANY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY GENERALLY CONSIDERS THE PROBABLE LIABILITY, AVAILABLE COVERAGE, RELEVANT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF

SIMILAR EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE MANY VARIABLES PRESENTED, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGED ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICYHOLDER AT EACH SITE; THE ALLEGATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM

AT EACH SITE; THE NUMBER OF SITES; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AND THE CORRESPONDING REMEDY AT EACH SITE; THE NATURE OF

GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT EACH SITE; THE OWNERSHIP AND GENERAL USE OF EACH SITE; THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE POLICYHOLDER, INCLUDING THE

ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS INSURANCE THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED TO THE POLICYHOLDER; THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURERS; THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER AVAILABLE COVERAGE, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF

COVERAGE; THE ROLE, IF ANY, OF NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS OR POTENTIAL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN ANY RESOLUTION PROCESS; AND THE APPLICABLE LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION.

CONVENTIONAL ACTUARIAL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT USED TO ESTIMATE THESE RESERVES.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE NOTICES FROM POLICYHOLDERS TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THESE POLICYHOLDERS GENERALLY PRESENT SMALLER EXPOSURES, HAVE FEWER SITES AND ARE LOWER

TIER DEFENDANTS. FURTHER, IN MANY INSTANCES CLEAN-UP COSTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BECAUSE REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT RISK-BASED SITE ANALYSES AND MORE EFFICIENT

CLEAN-UP TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED UPWARD DEVELOPMENT IN THE ANTICIPATED DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PENDING POLICYHOLDERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS

DEVELOPMENT, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE BY $85 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN BOTH THE NUMBER OF NEW POLICYHOLDERS

TENDERING CLAIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS POLICYHOLDERS PERTAINING TO COVERAGE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A

MODERATION IN THE RATE OF THAT DECLINE IN RECENT YEARS. THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE BY $185 MILLION IN 2007 PRIMARILY IN RESPONSE TO THIS DEVELOPMENT. IN 2006, THE COMPANY

INCREASED ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BY $120 MILLION PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER THAN EXPECTED DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT COSTS DRIVEN IN PART BY ADVERSE JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN STATES

REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF COVERAGE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES.

AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESERVES

CARRIED FOR

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON KNOWN FACTS, CURRENT LAW AND MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE

FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE EXPOSURE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THESE RESERVES ARE SUBJECT

TO REVISION AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS CLAIMS DEVELOP. THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RISKS AND

208

LACK

OF PREDICTABILITY INHERENT IN COMPLEX LITIGATION, ANY IMPACT FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION SOUGHT BY VARIOUS ASBESTOS PRODUCERS AND OTHER ASBESTOS DEFENDANTS, A FURTHER INCREASE OR DECREASE IN

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED, THE ROLE OF ANY UMBRELLA OR EXCESS POLICIES

THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED, THE RESOLUTION OR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES PERTAINING TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S

PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF THESE CLAIMS, THE NUMBER AND OUTCOME OF DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RECOVER REINSURANCE FOR ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OTHER INSURANCE SOURCES POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHETHER THROUGH EXHAUSTION OF POLICY LIMITS OR THROUGH THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHER

PARTICIPATING INSURERS. IN ADDITION, UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY OF POLICYHOLDERS AND OTHER DEFENDANTS, ALTHOUGH IN RECENT YEARS THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A DECREASE IN THE

NUMBER AND VOLATILITY OF ASBESTOS-RELATED BANKRUPTCIES. IT IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF COMPLEX COVERAGE DISPUTES UNTIL SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS NEAR COMPLETION AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE RESOLVED OR, FAILING SETTLEMENT, UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS

ADJUDICATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WITH POLICYHOLDERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHERE NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AND OTHER PARTIES AND REQUIRE COURT APPROVAL TO BE EFFECTIVE.

AS PART OF ITS CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO STUDY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS. (ALSO, SEE

"PART IITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS").

BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF CLAIMS AND

CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE

THE COMPANY HAS GEOGRAPHIC EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHE LOSSES, WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS NATURAL AND MAN-MADE EVENTS

INCLUDING HURRICANES, WINDSTORMS, TORNADOES, EARTHQUAKES, HAIL, SEVERE WINTER WEATHER, EXPLOSIONS AND FIRES. THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF CATASTROPHES ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. THE EXTENT OF

LOSSES FROM A CATASTROPHE IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURED EXPOSURE IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EVENT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT. MOST CATASTROPHES ARE RESTRICTED TO SMALL

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS; HOWEVER, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN LARGER AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE HEAVILY POPULATED. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SEEKS TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO

CATASTROPHES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL RISK SELECTION AND THE PURCHASE OF CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE.

THERE

ARE ALSO RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE COSTS FOR CATASTROPHES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES RELATED TO HURRICANES CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INABILITY OF THE

COMPANY AND ITS INSUREDS TO ACCESS PORTIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS, THE COMPLEXITY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSSES, THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES AND THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION

AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE RESERVES. COMPLEX FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: DETERMINING WHETHER DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING VERSUS WIND; EVALUATING GENERAL LIABILITY AND POLLUTION

EXPOSURES; ESTIMATING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES; THE IMPACT OF DEMAND SURGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTION; FRAUD; THE EFFECT OF MOLD DAMAGE AND

BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COSTS; AND REINSURANCE COLLECTIBILITY. THE TIMING OF A CATASTROPHE'S OCCURRENCE, SUCH AS AT OR NEAR THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD, CAN ALSO AFFECT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US

IN ESTIMATING RESERVES FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE ESTIMATES RELATED TO CATASTROPHES ARE ADJUSTED AS ACTUAL CLAIMS EMERGE.

2007 DEBT ISSUANCES

IN MARCH 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED $1 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.25%

FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE MARCH 15, 2067 FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $986 MILLION (AFTER ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT AND THE DEDUCTION OF

UNDERWRITING EXPENSES AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES). THE DEBENTURES WERE ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT, RESULTING IN AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 6.447%. THE DEBENTURES BEAR INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE

OF 6.25% FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE TO, BUT EXCLUDING, MARCH 15, 2017, PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON MARCH 15 AND SEPTEMBER 15. FROM AND INCLUDING

MARCH 15, 2017, THE DEBENTURES WILL BEAR INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 2.215%, PAYABLE QUARTERLY ON MARCH 15, JUNE 15, SEPTEMBER 15 AND

DECEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT, ON ONE OR MORE OCCASIONS, TO DEFER THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE DEBENTURES. THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE DEFERRED INTEREST

UNTIL IT HAS DEFERRED INTEREST FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OR, IF EARLIER, MADE A PAYMENT OF CURRENT INTEREST DURING A DEFERRAL PERIOD. THE COMPANY MAY DEFER INTEREST FOR UP TO TEN CONSECUTIVE YEARS

WITHOUT GIVING RISE TO AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. DEFERRED INTEREST WILL ACCUMULATE ADDITIONAL INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE EQUAL TO THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE THEN APPLICABLE TO THE DEBENTURES.

THE

DEBENTURES CARRY A 60-YEAR FINAL MATURITY AND A SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE IN YEAR THIRTY. DURING THE 180-DAY PERIOD ENDING NOT MORE THAN 15 AND NOT LESS THAN

TEN BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO SELL ENOUGH QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES, OR AT ITS OPTION, COMMON STOCK,

QUALIFYING WARRANTS, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON EQUITY OR DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR PREFERRED EQUITY TO PERMIT REPAYMENT OF THE DEBENTURES AT THE SCHEDULED

MATURITY DATE. IF ANY DEBENTURES REMAIN OUTSTANDING AFTER THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, THE UNPAID AMOUNT WILL REMAIN OUTSTANDING UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS RAISED SUFFICIENT PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF

QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES OR, AT ITS OPTION, COMMON STOCK, QUALIFYING WARRANTS, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON EQUITY OR DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR PREFERRED

EQUITY TO PERMIT THE REPAYMENT IN FULL OF THE DEBENTURES. IF THERE ARE REMAINING DEBENTURES AT THE FINAL MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO REDEEM THE DEBENTURES USING ANY SOURCE OF FUNDS.

QUALIFYING CAPITAL SECURITIES ARE SECURITIES (OTHER THAN COMMON STOCK, QUALIFYING WARRANTS, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON EQUITY, AND DEBT EXCHANGEABLE FOR

PREFERRED EQUITY) WHICH GENERALLY ARE TREATED BY THE RATINGS AGENCIES AS HAVING SIMILAR EQUITY CONTENT TO THE DEBENTURES.

THE

COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2017 AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT BEING

REDEEMED PLUS ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST. THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM THE DEBENTURES AT ITS OPTION PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2017 (A) IN WHOLE AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME OR

(B) IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN TAX OR RATING AGENCY EVENTS RELATING TO THE DEBENTURES, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT BEING

CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING OF THE DEBENTURES, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A "REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT" FOR THE BENEFIT OF HOLDERS OF ONE OR MORE DESIGNATED SERIES OF THE COMPANY'S

INDEBTEDNESS (WHICH WILL INITIALLY BE THE 6.750% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2036). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT, IF THE COMPANY REDEEMS THE DEBENTURES AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO

MARCH 15, 2047 IT CAN ONLY DO SO WITH THE PROCEEDS OF SECURITIES THAT ARE TREATED BY THE RATING AGENCIES AS HAVING SIMILAR EQUITY CONTENT TO THE DEBENTURES.

IN

MAY 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED $250 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.375% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 15, 2012 (THE 2012 SENIOR NOTES), $450 MILLION AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.750% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 15, 2017 (THE 2017 SENIOR NOTES), AND $800 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.250% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 15, 2037 (THE

2037 SENIOR NOTES). THE TOTAL NET PROCEEDS OF THESE THREE SENIOR NOTE ISSUANCES, AFTER ORIGINAL ISSUANCE DISCOUNTS AND THE DEDUCTION OF UNDERWRITING EXPENSES AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES, WERE

APPROXIMATELY $1.47 BILLION. INTEREST ON EACH OF THE SENIOR NOTE ISSUANCES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY ON JUNE 15 AND DECEMBER 15, COMMENCING DECEMBER 15, 2007.

EACH SERIES OF SENIOR NOTES IS REDEEMABLE IN WHOLE AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF (A) 100% OF THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED, OR (B) THE SUM OF THE PRESENT VALUES OF THE REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED (EXCLUSIVE

MONTHS) AT THE THEN CURRENT TREASURY RATE PLUS 12.5 BASIS POINTS FOR THE 2012 SENIOR NOTES, 15 BASIS POINTS FOR THE 2017 SENIOR NOTES AND 20 BASIS POINTS FOR THE 2037 SENIOR NOTES. THE COMPANY APPLIED

A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF THIS OFFERING TO REPAY APPROXIMATELY $442 MILLION OF SENIOR NOTES MATURING ON AUGUST 16, 2007 AND TO REPAY APPROXIMATELY $42 MILLION OF

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MATURING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007. THE REMAINING PROCEEDS WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. PRIOR TO APPLYING THESE PROCEEDS, THE COMPANY INVESTED THEM IN

INVESTMENT GRADE, MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

2007 DEBT REDEMPTIONS AND MATURITIES

IN JANUARY 2007, THE COMPANY REDEEMED $81 MILLION OF 8.47% SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN 1997 AND DUE JANUARY 10, 2027. THE DEBENTURES WERE REDEEMABLE BY THE COMPANY ON OR AFTER JANUARY 10, 2007. IN JANUARY 1997, USF&G CAPITAL II, A BUSINESS TRUST,

ISSUED $100 MILLION OF CAPITAL SECURITIES, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH, ALONG WITH $3 MILLION IN CAPITAL PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY, WERE USED TO PURCHASE THE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED BY

USF&G CORPORATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY ASSUMED BY THE COMPANY AFTER THE MERGER OF THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES INC. (SPC) AND TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY CORP. (TPC). DURING THE PERIOD PRIOR TO

REDEMPTION, THE COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED AND RETIRED $22 MILLION OF THE DEBENTURES IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS. UPON THE COMPANY'S REDEMPTION OF THE REMAINING $81 MILLION OF SUBORDINATED

DEBENTURES IN JANUARY 2007, USF&G CAPITAL II IN TURN USED THE PROCEEDS TO REDEEM ITS REMAINING CAPITAL SECURITIES OUTSTANDING. USF&G CAPITAL II WAS THEN LIQUIDATED, AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED A

$3 MILLION DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL. THE COMPANY RECORDED A $3 MILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE REDEMPTION OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES, DUE TO THE REMAINING UNAMORTIZED FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT

RECORDED AT THE MERGER DATE, LESS THE REDEMPTION PREMIUM PAID.

IN

MARCH 2007, THE COMPANY'S $500 MILLION, 5.75% SENIOR NOTES MATURED AND WERE FULLY PAID.

IN

APRIL 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE REDEMPTION OF ITS OUTSTANDING $893 MILLION, 4.50% CONVERTIBLE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE IN 2032 (THE NOTES). THE NOTES WERE ORIGINALLY

THE ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE NOTES MATURE IN MARCH 2009, BUT ARE REDEEMABLE AT THE OPTION OF THE

COMPANY FOR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE PLUS ACCRETED ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT. EACH NOTE IS CONVERTIBLE AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER AT ANY TIME ON OR PRIOR TO MATURITY, UNLESS

PREVIOUSLY REDEEMED BY THE COMPANY, INTO COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY AT A CONVERSION RATE OF 16.6433 SHARES FOR EACH $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES. IF ALL NOTES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 WERE CONVERTED, THE COMPANY WOULD ISSUE 2.4 MILLION OF ITS COMMON SHARES.

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

THE COMPANY'S $1 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.25%

FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE "2007 DEBT ISSUANCES" SECTION ABOVE. THE COMPANY'S OTHER THREE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE

INSTRUMENTS ARE ALL SIMILAR IN NATURE. THREE SEPARATE BUSINESS TRUSTS ISSUED PREFERRED SECURITIES TO INVESTORS AND USED THE PROCEEDS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES. INTEREST ON EACH

OF THE INSTRUMENTS IS PAID SEMI-ANNUALLY.

THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDES THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER, WHICH WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE RESULTING FAIR VALUE

ADJUSTMENT IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING THE EFFECTIVE-INTEREST METHOD. THE AMORTIZATION OF THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT REDUCED INTEREST EXPENSE BY

$15 MILLION AND $19 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

MERGER RELATED TO THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES, INC. STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP) TRUST WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MERGED INTO THE TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN). THE SOP

TRUST MAY AT ANY TIME CONVERT ANY OR ALL OF THE PREFERRED SHARES INTO SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AT A RATE OF EIGHT SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR EACH PREFERRED SHARE. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

HAS RESERVED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO SATISFY THE CONVERSION OF ALL PREFERRED SHARES ISSUED TO THE SOP TRUST AND THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES TO MEET EMPLOYEE

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. UPON THE REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SHARES, THE COMPANY WILL ISSUE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO THE TRUST TO FULFILL THE REDEMPTION OBLIGATIONS. SEE NOTE 13. HOLDERS OF THE

PREFERRED STOCK HAVE A PREFERENCE UPON LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP OF THE COMPANY OF $100 PER SHARE.

COMMON STOCK

THE COMPANY IS GOVERNED BY THE MINNESOTA BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT. ALL AUTHORIZED SHARES OF VOTING COMMON STOCK HAVE NO PAR VALUE.

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REACQUIRED ARE CONSIDERED AUTHORIZED AND UNISSUED SHARES. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF THE COMPANY IS 1.75 BILLION. THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION ALLOW THE COMPANY

TO ISSUE FIVE MILLION UNDESIGNATED SHARES. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DESIGNATE THE TYPE OF SHARES AND SET THE TERMS THEREOF. THE BOARD DESIGNATED 1,450,000 SHARES AS SERIES B CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THE 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN.

TREASURY STOCK

IN MAY 2006, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $2 BILLION OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON

STOCK. IN JANUARY 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $3 BILLION OF SHARE REPURCHASE CAPACITY. IN JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A $5 BILLION

INCREASE TO THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. UNDER THESE AUTHORIZATIONS, REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET, PURSUANT TO PRESET TRADING PLANS MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF

RULE 10B5-1 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. THE AUTHORIZATIONS DO NOT HAVE A STATED EXPIRATION DATE. THE TIMING AND ACTUAL NUMBER OF

SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CORPORATE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, PRICE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

IF

THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT ANY OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT RESULT IN FUTURE TAX BENEFITS, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE MUST BE ESTABLISHED FOR THE PORTION OF THESE ASSETS THAT ARE

NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED. THE NET DECREASES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WERE $36 MILLION AND $46 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY,

RELATING IN EACH YEAR TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS. BASED UPON A REVIEW OF THE COMPANY'S ANTICIPATED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND ALSO INCLUDING ALL OTHER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, THE

COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED.

FOR

TAX RETURN PURPOSES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD NET OPERATING LOSS (NOL) CARRYFORWARDS ON A REGULAR TAX BASIS AND AN ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX (AMT) BASIS OF

APPROXIMATELY $81 MILLION AND $47 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE NOL CARRYFORWARDS EXPIRE, IF UNUSED, IN 2017 AND 2018. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REALIZING THE BENEFIT OF NOL CARRYFORWARDS

DEPENDS ON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY TAX LAWS. THE BENEFIT OF THE NOL CARRYFORWARD HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

U.S.

INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON $317 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN OPERATIONS' UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, AS SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED

TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE OPERATIONS. FURTHERMORE, ANY TAXES PAID TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ON THESE EARNINGS MAY BE USED AS CREDITS AGAINST THE U.S. TAX ON ANY DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM

SUCH EARNINGS.

ACCRUED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY EFFECTIVELY SETTLED INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) TAX EXAMINATIONS FOR ALL YEARS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2004. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY

RECORDED AFTER-TAX BENEFITS OF $86 MILLION IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007. IN ADDITION, $63 MILLION OF PREVIOUSLY

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE IRS SETTLEMENT WERE RECOGNIZED THROUGH A REDUCTION OF GOODWILL IN 2007.

THE

IRS IS CONDUCTING AN EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2005 THROUGH 2006. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ITS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED

TAX BENEFITS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

12. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS A SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN, THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN), WHICH REPLACED

PRIOR SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS (LEGACY PLANS). THE PURPOSES OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN ARE TO ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY'S NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES WITH THOSE OF THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS, AND TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN PERSONNEL BY PROVIDING INCENTIVES IN THE FORM OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN PERMITS

GRANTS OF NONQUALIFIED

STOCK OPTIONS, INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED OR

STOCK-DENOMINATED AWARDS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZED FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN IS 35 MILLION SHARES,

SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY OF ISSUING NEW SHARES TO SETTLE THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTION AWARDS AND THE VESTING OF OTHER

EQUITY AWARDS.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, LEGACY SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS WERE TERMINATED. OUTSTANDING GRANTS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE TERMINATION OF

THESE LEGACY PLANS, INCLUDING THE GRANT OF RELOAD OPTIONS RELATED TO PRIOR OPTION GRANTS UNDER THE LEGACY PLANS.

THE

2004 INCENTIVE PLAN IS THE ONLY PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED. IN ADDITION TO THE 35 MILLION SHARES INITIALLY AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER

THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN, THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE COUNTED TOWARDS THE 35 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN: (I) SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO AN AWARD THAT EXPIRES UNEXERCISED, THAT IS FORFEITED, TERMINATED OR CANCELED, THAT IS SETTLED IN CASH OR OTHER FORMS OF PROPERTY, OR OTHERWISE DOES NOT RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE

(III) SHARES PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ON THE OPEN MARKET USING CASH OPTION EXERCISE PROCEEDS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR GRANT

PURSUANT TO SUCH MARKET PURCHASES SHALL NOT BE GREATER THAN THE NUMBER THAT COULD BE REPURCHASED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF EXERCISE OF THE STOCK OPTION GIVING RISE TO SUCH OPTION PROCEEDS.

THESE PROVISIONS ALSO APPLY TO AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE LEGACY SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN.

THE

IN

ADDITION TO THE STOCK OPTION AWARDS DESCRIBED ABOVE, CERTAIN STOCK OPTION AWARDS THAT WERE GRANTED UNDER LEGACY PLANS PERMIT AN EMPLOYEE EXERCISING AN OPTION TO BE GRANTED A NEW

OPTION (A RELOAD OPTION) AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE ON

WHICH THE ORIGINAL OPTION IS EXERCISED. THE RELOAD OPTION IS PERMITTED ON CERTAIN STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2003 AT AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMMON STOCK USED

TO SATISFY BOTH THE EXERCISE PRICE AND WITHHOLDING TAXES DUE UPON EXERCISE OF AN OPTION AND VEST EITHER SIX MONTHS OR ONE YEAR AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE

RELATED ORIGINAL OPTION.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT BY APPLICATION OF A VARIATION OF THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL USING THE ASSUMPTIONS NOTED IN THE FOLLOWING

TABLE. THE EXPECTED TERM OF NEWLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS IS THE TIME TO VEST PLUS HALF THE REMAINING TIME TO EXPIRATION. THIS CONSIDERS THE VESTING RESTRICTION AND REPRESENTS AN EVEN PATTERN OF

EXERCISE BEHAVIOR OVER THE REMAINING TERM. RELOAD OPTIONS ARE EXERCISABLE FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE ORIGINAL OPTION AND THEREFORE WOULD GENERALLY HAVE A SHORTER EXPECTED TERM. THE EXPECTED

VOLATILITY IS BASED ON THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMMON STOCK OF AN INDUSTRY PEER GROUP OF ENTITIES, DUE TO THE LIMITED COMPANY STOCK HISTORY, OVER THE ESTIMATED OPTION TERM BASED ON

THE MID-MONTH OF THE OPTION GRANT. THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S CURRENT QUARTER DIVIDEND ANNUALIZED AND ASSUMED TO BE CONSTANT OVER THE EXPECTED OPTION TERM. THE

RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE FOR EACH OPTION IS THE INTERPOLATED MARKET YIELD FOR THE MID-MONTH OF THE OPTION GRANT ON A U.S. TREASURY BILL WITH A TERM COMPARABLE TO THE EXPECTED

OPTION TERM OF THE GRANTED STOCK OPTION. SHARES RECEIVED THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES UNDER THE RELOAD PROGRAM ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION ON SALE. A 10% DISCOUNT, AS MEASURED BY THE ESTIMATED COST OF

PROTECTING AGAINST CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF RELOAD OPTIONS GRANTED TO REFLECT THESE SALES RESTRICTIONS. THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR

VALUE OF OPTIONS ON GRANT DATE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD PROGRAMS

THE COMPANY, COMMENCING WITH EQUITY GRANTS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007, ISSUES RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS

AND KEY EMPLOYEES UNDER THE EQUITY AWARDS PROGRAM ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN. A RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT REPRESENTS THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. THESE RESTRICTED

STOCK UNIT AWARDS ARE GRANTED AT MARKET PRICE, GENERALLY VEST THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, DO NOT HAVE VOTING RIGHTS AND THE UNDERLYING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE NOT ISSUED UNTIL THE VESTING

CRITERIA IS SATISFIED. PREVIOUSLY EQUITY AWARDS WERE GRANTED UNDER THE CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROGRAM (CAP) WHICH WAS DISCONTINUED FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF CAP AWARDS IN FEBRUARY 2006. AWARDS ISSUED

UNDER CAP WERE IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES INCLUDED IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD WAS CALCULATED AT A 10% DISCOUNT FROM THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF THE AWARD AND

GENERALLY VESTED IN FULL AFTER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, THE STOCK GENERALLY COULD NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED BY THE PARTICIPANT, WHO WAS

REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE TO THE COMPANY DURING THE RESTRICTED PERIOD.

THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS A PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS PROGRAM PURSUANT TO THE 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE BEGINNING IN 2006. UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE PERFORMANCE

SHARE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF VICE PRESIDENT (OR ITS EQUIVALENT) OR ABOVE. THE PERFORMANCE AWARDS REPRESENT SHARES THAT PROVIDE THE RECIPIENT THE RIGHT TO EARN

SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S ATTAINMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE GOALS. THE PERFORMANCE GOALS FOR PERFORMANCE AWARDS ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ADJUSTED RETURN ON EQUITY

OVER A THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. VESTING OF ANY PERFORMANCE SHARES IS CONTINGENT UPON THE COMPANY ATTAINING THE RELEVANT PERFORMANCE PERIOD MINIMUM THRESHOLD RETURN ON EQUITY. IF THE

PERFORMANCE PERIOD RETURN ON EQUITY IS BELOW THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD, NONE OF THE SHARES WILL VEST; IF PERFORMANCE MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE THRESHOLD, BETWEEN 50%-160% OF THE

PERFORMANCE SHARES WILL VEST, DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL RETURN ON EQUITY ATTAINED.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARES IS MEASURED AT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY STOCK AT DATE OF GRANT.

THE

TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF SHARES THAT VESTED DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS $82 MILLION, $99 MILLION AND $59 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ON

FEBRUARY 3, 2009, THE COMPANY, UNDER THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, GRANTED 2,370,043 COMMON STOCK AWARDS IN THE FORM OF

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS TO PARTICIPATING OFFICERS, NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND DEFERRED STOCK

AWARDS TOTALED 1,437,922 SHARES WHILE THE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS TOTALED 932,121 SHARES. THE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMMON STOCK AWARDS ON THE DATE OF GRANT WAS $39.19.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNITION

THE COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A SERVICE CONDITION IS BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH THE REQUISITE

SERVICE PERIOD IS EXPECTED TO BE RENDERED. AWARDS GRANTED TO RETIREE-ELIGIBLE OR TO EMPLOYEES WHO BECOME RETIREE-ELIGIBLE BEFORE AN AWARD'S VESTING DATE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE MET THE REQUISITE

SERVICE CONDITION. THE COMPENSATION COST FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO A PERFORMANCE CONDITION IS BASED UPON THE PROBABLE OUTCOME OF THE PERFORMANCE CONDITION. THE COMPENSATION COST REFLECTS AN ESTIMATED

ANNUAL FORFEITURE RATE OF 5% OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARDS. THAT ESTIMATE IS REVISED IF SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS EXPECTED TO VEST IS

LIKELY TO DIFFER FROM PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. COMPENSATION COSTS FOR AWARDS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. FOR AWARDS THAT HAVE A GRADED VESTING

SCHEDULE, THE COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD FOR EACH SEPARATE VESTING PORTION OF THE AWARD AS IF THE AWARD WAS, IN SUBSTANCE,

MULTIPLE AWARDS. THE TOTAL COMPENSATION COST FOR ALL SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS

$123 MILLION, $125 MILLION AND $147 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THOSE AMOUNTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION, $6 MILLION AND

$51 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006.

AS

STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANY'S 2004 INCENTIVE PLAN AND LEGACY TPC AND LEGACY SPC SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE

COMPENSATION PLANS. THE UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.7 YEARS.

THE

COMPANY HAS DISCRETION REGARDING WHETHER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND WHEN TO PROVIDE SUCH FUNDING TO ITS QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. DURING 2008, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY MADE

CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $450 MILLION TO THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL BE MADE DURING 2009. THERE IS NO REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION

TO THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN DURING 2009.

THE

PENSION PLAN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION DIVESTITURE OF $17 MILLION AND THE PENSION PLAN ASSET DIVESTITURE OF $12 MILLION IN 2007 WAS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF THE

QUARTER 2007. THE 414(K) ASSET TRANSFER WAS MADE AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S REVIEW OF THE STRUCTURE AND INVESTMENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE UNDER THE PENSION PLAN, AND AFTER RECENT CHANGES IN FEDERAL LAW

GOVERNING TAX-DEFERRED IRA TRANSFERS FOR NON-SPOUSE BENEFICIARIES.

THE

DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION USED TO DETERMINE THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR 2008 WAS BASED ON A YIELD-CURVE APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH, A WEIGHTED AVERAGE YIELD IS DETERMINED FROM A

HYPOTHETICAL PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED MATURITY CORPORATE BONDS (RATED AA OR HIGHER) AVAILABLE AT THE YEAR-END VALUATION DATE FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH OUTFLOWS

CORRESPOND WITH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYOUTS OF THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT PLAN. THE 2007 DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION WAS BASED ON THE MOODY'S AA CORPORATE BOND INDEX INCREASED BY 25

BASIS POINTS TO REFLECT THE LONG DURATION NATURE OF THE PENSION OBLIGATION, ADJUSTED TO THE NEAREST QUARTER RATE, AND THEN BACK-TESTED BY COMPARISON TO A YIELD CURVE APPROACH. THE COMPANY

CHANGED ITS DISCOUNT RATE APPROACH AS A RESULT OF THE SEVERE MARKET DISRUPTIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING 2008 THAT CAUSED THE LIMITED POPULATION OF BONDS CONTAINED IN THE MOODY'S AA CORPORATE BOND INDEX

TO NO LONGER BE REPRESENTATIVE OF A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY DEBT INSTRUMENTS FROM WHICH THE COMPANY WOULD CHOOSE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO PAY THE PENSION BENEFITS

WHEN DUE.

IN

CHOOSING THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN, THE COMPANY'S PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL RETURNS OF EQUITY AND FIXED MATURITY MARKETS IN

CONJUNCTION WITH TODAY'S ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

AS

AN INDICATOR OF SENSITIVITY, INCREASING THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE BY 1% WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $32 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND THE AGGREGATE OF THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE BY $2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008.

PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF THE PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES AND ARE INTENDED, OVER TIME, TO SATISFY THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PLAN. RISK

TOLERANCE IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH CONSIDERATION OF PLAN LIABILITIES, PLAN FUNDED STATUS, AND CORPORATE FINANCIAL POSITION. THE ASSET MIX GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY.

THESE GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO SERVE AS TOOLS TO FACILITATE THE INVESTMENT OF PLAN ASSETS TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM TOTAL RETURN AND THE ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF THE PLAN'S INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE. THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONTAINS A DIVERSIFIED MIX OF EQUITY AND FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS. EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE DIVERSIFIED ACROSS U.S. AND NON-U.S. STOCKS. OTHER ASSETS

SUCH AS PARTNERSHIPS AND REAL ESTATE ARE USED TO ENHANCE LONG-TERM RETURNS WHILE IMPROVING PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. INVESTMENT RISK IS MEASURED AND MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS THROUGH

DAILY AND MONTHLY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REVIEW, ANNUAL LIABILITY MEASUREMENTS, AND PERIODIC ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES.

SAVINGS PLAN

THE COMPANY HAS A SAVINGS PLAN, THE TRAVELERS 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN (THE SAVINGS PLAN), IN WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMPANY EMPLOYEES ARE

ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. UNDER THE SAVINGS PLAN, THE COMPANY MATCHED EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 5% OF ELIGIBLE PAY, WITH A MAXIMUM ANNUAL MATCH OF $5,000 WHICH BECOMES 100% VESTED AFTER THREE YEARS

OF SERVICE. THE COMPANY MATCH CONTRIBUTED TO ACCOUNTS IN 2006 WAS PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. BEGINNING WITH THE 2006 MATCH THAT WAS CONTRIBUTED IN 2007, THE COMPANY MATCHING

CONTRIBUTION IS MADE IN CASH AND INVESTED ACCORDING TO THE EMPLOYEE'S CURRENT INVESTMENT ELECTIONS. THE COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTION CAN BE REINVESTED AT ANY TIME INTO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT OPTION.

THE EXPENSE RELATED TO THIS PLAN WAS $94 MILLION AND $78 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

INCLUDED

IN THE SAVINGS PLAN ARE A LEGACY SAVINGS PLUS PLAN (SPP) AND A STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (SOP) IN WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES WHO WERE HIRED BY LEGACY SPC BEFORE

APRIL 1, 2004 WERE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN 2004 UNDER THE SPP, THE COMPANY MATCHED 100% OF EMPLOYEES' CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 6% OF THEIR SALARY. THE MATCH WAS IN THE FORM OF

PREFERRED SHARES, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE IN THE SOP, OR IN THE COMPANY'S COMMON SHARES. ALSO ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS WERE PREFERRED SHARES EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF DIVIDENDS ON PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED

SHARES. EACH SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK PAYS A DIVIDEND OF $11.72 ANNUALLY AND IS CURRENTLY CONVERTIBLE INTO EIGHT SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE SOP HAS NO PREFERRED SHARES AVAILABLE FOR

FUTURE ALLOCATIONS.

ALL

COMMON SHARES AND THE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENT OF ALL PREFERRED SHARES HELD BY THE SAVINGS PLAN ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR DILUTED EPS COMPUTATIONS AND DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALL

SHARES ARE CHARGED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

CONTINGENCIES

THE FOLLOWING SECTION DESCRIBES THE MAJOR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO THE BUSINESS,

TO WHICH THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS A PARTY OR TO WHICH ANY OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY IS SUBJECT.

ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED PROCEEDINGS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESS, THE COMPANY RECEIVES CLAIMS FOR INSURANCE ARISING UNDER POLICIES ISSUED BY THE

COMPANY ASSERTING ALLEGED INJURIES AND DAMAGES FROM ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED EXPOSURES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF RELATED COVERAGE LITIGATION, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LITIGATION DESCRIBED

BELOW. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE ASBESTOS-RELATED LITIGATION. THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS AND THE RELATED LITIGATION CONTINUE TO CHANGE. THE

COMPANY IS DEFENDING ITS ASBESTOS- AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED LITIGATION VIGOROUSLY AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES OF THESE DISPUTES ARE UNCERTAIN. IN THIS REGARD,

THE COMPANY EMPLOYS DEDICATED SPECIALISTS AND AGGRESSIVE RESOLUTION STRATEGIES TO MANAGE ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS EXPOSURE, INCLUDING SETTLING LITIGATION UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE, SEE "PART IIITEM 7MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION," "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION" AND "UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES."

IN

OCTOBER 2001 AND APRIL 2002, TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS (

WISE V. TRAVELERS

AND

MENINGER V.

TRAVELERS

) WERE FILED AGAINST TPC AND OTHER INSURERS (NOT INCLUDING SPC) IN STATE COURT IN WEST VIRGINIA. THESE AND OTHER CASES SUBSEQUENTLY FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA WERE

CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE PROCEEDING IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE INSURER DEFENDANTS ENGAGED IN UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BY INAPPROPRIATELY

HANDLING AND SETTLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO REOPEN LARGE NUMBERS OF SETTLED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES, DIRECTLY ON INSURERS.

SIMILAR LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN MASSACHUSETTS AND HAWAII STATE COURTS (THESE SUITS AND THE WEST VIRGINIA SUITS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS).

IN

MARCH 2002, THE PLAINTIFFS IN CONSOLIDATED ASBESTOS ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE A MASS TORT PANEL OF JUDGES IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT AMENDED THEIR COMPLAINT TO INCLUDE TPC AS A

DEFENDANT, ALLEGING THAT TPC AND OTHER INSURERS BREACHED ALLEGED DUTIES TO CERTAIN USERS OF ASBESTOS PRODUCTS. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. LAWSUITS SEEKING SIMILAR RELIEF

AND RAISING SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS, PRIMARILY VIOLATIONS OF PURPORTED COMMON LAW DUTIES TO THIRD PARTIES, ARE ALSO PENDING IN TEXAS STATE COURT AGAINST TPC AND SPC, AND IN LOUISIANA STATE COURT AGAINST

TPC (THE CLAIMS ASSERTED

THESE SUITS, TOGETHER WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA SUIT, ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS).

THE

FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT THAT HAD PRESIDED OVER THE BANKRUPTCY OF TPC'S FORMER POLICYHOLDER JOHNS-MANVILLE CORPORATION ISSUED A TEMPORARY INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE PROSECUTION OF

THE STATUTORY ACTIONS (BUT NOT THE HAWAII ACTIONS), THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS AND AN ADDITIONAL SET OF CASES FILED IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS IN TEXAS AND OHIO, AND ENJOINING CERTAIN ATTORNEYS FROM FILING

ANY FURTHER LAWSUITS AGAINST TPC BASED ON SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE INJUNCTION, ADDITIONAL COMMON LAW CLAIMS WERE FILED AGAINST TPC.

IN

NOVEMBER 2003, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS. THIS SETTLEMENT INCLUDES A LUMP-SUM PAYMENT OF UP TO $412 MILLION BY TPC,

SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. IN MAY 2004, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT RESOLVING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PENDING AND SIMILAR FUTURE COMMON LAW CLAIMS AGAINST TPC. THIS SETTLEMENT

REQUIRES A PAYMENT OF UP TO $90 MILLION BY TPC, SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCIES. EACH OF THESE SETTLEMENTS IS CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A FINAL ORDER OF THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT CLARIFYING THAT ALL OF THESE CLAIMS, AND SIMILAR FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS AGAINST TPC, ARE BARRED BY PRIOR ORDERS ENTERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT.

ON

AUGUST 17, 2004, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED AN ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENTS AND CLARIFYING ITS PRIOR ORDERS THAT ALL OF THE PENDING STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON LAW

CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST TPC ARE BARRED. THE ORDER ALSO APPLIES TO SIMILAR DIRECT ACTION CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

ON

MARCH 29, 2006, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SUBSTANTIALLY AFFIRMED THE BANKRUPTCY COURT'S ORDERS WHILE VACATING THAT PORTION OF THE

BANKRUPTCY COURT'S ORDERS THAT REQUIRED ALL FUTURE DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST TPC TO FIRST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT BEFORE PROCEEDING IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.

VARIOUS

PARTIES APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURT'S MARCH 29, 2006 RULING TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. ON FEBRUARY 15, 2008, THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED AN

OPINION VACATING ON JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS THE DISTRICT COURT'S APPROVAL OF AN ORDER ISSUED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT PROHIBITING THE PROSECUTION OF THE STATUTORY AND HAWAII ACTIONS AND THE COMMON LAW

CLAIMS, AS WELL AS FUTURE SIMILAR DIRECT ACTION LITIGATION, AGAINST TPC. ON FEBRUARY 29, 2008, TPC AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTIES TO THE APPEALS FILED PETITIONS FOR REHEARING AND/OR REHEARING

EN BANC

,

REQUESTING REINSTATEMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S JUDGMENT, WHICH WERE DENIED. TPC AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTIES FILED PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF

CERTIORARI IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SEEKING REVIEW OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S DECISION, AND ON DECEMBER 12, 2008, THE PETITIONS WERE GRANTED. UNLESS THE SUPREME COURT REVERSES THE SECOND

CIRCUIT'S DECISION, AND THE BANKRUPTCY COURT'S ORDER IS REINSTATED AND BECOMES FINAL, THE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE VOIDED, AND TPC WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS (OTHER THAN CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES). IN THAT CASE, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO LITIGATE THE DIRECT ACTION CASES VIGOROUSLY.

SPC,

WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT RULINGS OR THE SETTLEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IS A PARTY TO PENDING DIRECT ACTION CASES IN TEXAS STATE COURT ASSERTING COMMON LAW CLAIMS.

ALL SUCH CASES THAT ARE STILL PENDING AND IN WHICH SPC HAS BEEN SERVED ARE CURRENTLY ON THE INACTIVE DOCKET IN TEXAS STATE COURT. IF ANY OF THOSE CASES BECOMES ACTIVE, SPC INTENDS TO LITIGATE THOSE

CASES VIGOROUSLY.

CURRENTLY,

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT LEGAL OUTCOMES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION RELATING TO ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. ANY SUCH

DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES MAY ARISE FOR AMOUNTS

IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT RELATED RESERVES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY CHANGE. THESE ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR INCREASES IN ESTIMATES, OR A

RANGE OF EITHER, CANNOT NOW BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND COULD RESULT IN INCOME STATEMENT CHARGES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN PROCEEDINGS ADDRESSING DISPUTES WITH ITS REINSURERS REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS

DUE UNDER THE COMPANY'S REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY BE INITIATED BY THE COMPANY OR THE REINSURERS AND MAY INVOLVE THE TERMS OF THE REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS, THE COVERAGE OF PARTICULAR

CLAIMS, EXCLUSIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS COUNTERCLAIMS FOR RESCISSION OF THE AGREEMENTS. ONE OF THESE DISPUTES IS THE ACTION DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.

THE

COMPANY'S GULF OPERATION BROUGHT AN ACTION ON MAY 22, 2003 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK (

GULF INSURANCE COMPANY V.

TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL.

), AGAINST TRANSATLANTIC REINSURANCE COMPANY (TRANSATLANTIC), XL REINSURANCE AMERICA, INC. (XL), ODYSSEY AMERICA REINSURANCE

CORPORATION (ODYSSEY), EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE COMPANY (EMPLOYERS) AND GERLING GLOBAL REINSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA (GERLING), TO RECOVER AMOUNTS DUE UNDER REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND

RELATED TO GULF'S FEBRUARY 2003 SETTLEMENT OF A COVERAGE DISPUTE UNDER A VEHICLE RESIDUAL VALUE PROTECTION INSURANCE POLICY. THE REINSURERS ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING RESCISSION OF THE VEHICLE

RESIDUAL VALUE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO GULF AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT. GERLING COMMENCED A SEPARATE ACTION ASSERTING THE SAME CLAIMS, WHICH HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE

ORIGINAL GULF ACTION FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES.

GULF

HAS ENTERED INTO FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYERS, XL, TRANSATLANTIC AND ODYSSEY WHICH RESOLVE ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN GULF AND THESE DEFENDANTS UNDER THE REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS AT ISSUE IN THE LITIGATION.

IN

NOVEMBER 2007, THE COURT ISSUED RULINGS DENYING GULF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST GERLING, THE SOLE REMAINING DEFENDANT, BUT GRANTING GERLING'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL

SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON CERTAIN CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED BY GULF AND GERLING. GULF HAS APPEALED THE COURT'S DECISION TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK APPELLATE DIVISION, FIRST DEPARTMENT, AND HAS

BEEN GRANTED A STAY OF TRIAL ON THE REMAINING CLAIMS PENDING THAT APPEAL. BRIEFING OF THE APPEAL WAS COMPLETED ON APRIL 11, 2008, AND ORAL ARGUMENT WAS HELD ON MAY 20, 2008. GULF DENIES

GERLING'S ALLEGATIONS, BELIEVES THAT IT HAS A STRONG LEGAL BASIS TO COLLECT THE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THE ACTION.

BASED

ON THE COMPANY'S BELIEFS ABOUT ITS LEGAL POSITIONS IN ITS VARIOUS REINSURANCE RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ANY OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, AS PART OF INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATIONS THAT COMMENCED IN OCTOBER 2004, THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES RECEIVED SUBPOENAS AND WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION FROM A NUMBER

OF

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS, THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND THE U.S. SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). THE AREAS OF PENDING INQUIRY ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY INCLUDE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH BROKERS AND AGENTS AND THE COMPANY'S INVOLVEMENT WITH "NON-TRADITIONAL

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PRODUCTS." THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS.

THE

COMPANY COOPERATED WITH THESE SUBPOENAS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, OUTSIDE COUNSEL, WITH THE OVERSIGHT OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CONDUCTED AN INTERNAL

REVIEW OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS PRACTICES. THIS REVIEW WAS COMMENCED AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF LITIGATION BROUGHT IN OCTOBER 2004 BY THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AGAINST A MAJOR

BROKER. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS REVIEW. WITH RESPECT TO THE IDENTIFIED FINITE PRODUCTS PURCHASED AND SOLD, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT NO ADJUSTMENT TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS

REQUIRED. ANY AUTHORITY WITH OPEN INQUIRIES OR INVESTIGATIONS COULD ASK THAT ADDITIONAL WORK BE PERFORMED OR REACH CONCLUSIONS DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPANY'S.

IN

2005, FOUR PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE BROUGHT AGAINST A NUMBER OF INSURANCE BROKERS AND INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, BY PLAINTIFFS WHO

ALLEGEDLY PURCHASED INSURANCE PRODUCTS THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE DEFENDANT BROKERS. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGED THAT VARIOUS INSURANCE BROKERS CONSPIRED WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH VARIOUS INSURERS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND/OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES, TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE PREMIUMS, ALLOCATE BROKERAGE CUSTOMERS AND RIG BIDS FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS OFFERED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. TO THE EXTENT

THEY WERE NOT ORIGINALLY FILED THERE, THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTIONS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY AND WERE CONSOLIDATED FOR PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS

WITH OTHER CLASS ACTIONS UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

. ON AUGUST 1, 2005, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING THE

FOUR NAMED PLAINTIFFS IN THE ABOVE-REFERENCED CLASS ACTIONS, FILED AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT NAMING VARIOUS BROKERS AND INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS

AFFILIATES, ON BEHALF OF A PUTATIVE NATIONWIDE CLASS OF POLICYHOLDERS. THE COMPLAINT INCLUDED CAUSES OF ACTION UNDER THE SHERMAN ACT, THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT (RICO),

STATE COMMON LAW AND THE LAWS OF THE VARIOUS STATES PROHIBITING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. THE COMPLAINT SOUGHT MONETARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND TREBLED DAMAGES, PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE

RELIEF, RESTITUTION, INCLUDING DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS, INTEREST AND COSTS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES. ALL DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM. AFTER GIVING

PLAINTIFFS MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPLEAD, THE COURT DISMISSED THE SHERMAN ACT CLAIMS ON AUGUST 31, 2007 AND THE RICO CLAIMS ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2007, BOTH WITH PREJUDICE, AND DECLINED

TO EXERCISE SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION OVER THE STATE LAW CLAIMS. THE PLAINTIFFS ARE APPEALING THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISIONS TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUAL

ACTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS AGAINST THE COMPANY INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN

IN RE INSURANCE BROKERAGE ANTITRUST

LITIGATION,

AND FURTHER ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NO MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY.

IN

ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS, NOT INVOLVING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS, ARISING MOSTLY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS

OPERATIONS, EITHER AS A LIABILITY INSURER DEFENDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST POLICYHOLDERS, OR AS AN INSURER DEFENDING CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST IT RELATING TO COVERAGE OR THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESS PRACTICES. WHILE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A FUTURE PERIOD, IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, NONE WOULD LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

THE

COMPANY PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT IT SOUGHT GUIDANCE FROM THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROPRIATE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN

SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $1.63 BILLION. SEE "ITEM 1BUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS." AFTER DISCUSSION WITH THE STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATE FINANCE AND THE

COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS APPROPRIATE. ON MAY 3, 2006, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE

DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE SEC (THE DIVISION) ADVISING THE COMPANY THAT IT IS CONDUCTING AN INQUIRY RELATING TO THE SECOND QUARTER 2004 ADJUSTMENTS AND THE APRIL 1, 2004 MERGER OF SPC AND

TPC. THE COMPANY COOPERATED WITH THE DIVISION'S REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.

OTHER COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

COMMITMENTS

INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO

PARTNERSHIPS, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES, JOINT VENTURES AND CERTAIN PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN WHICH IT INVESTS. THESE COMMITMENTS WERE $1.56 BILLION AND $1.60 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

SPC'S SALE OF MINET

IN MAY 1997, SPC COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS INSURANCE BROKERAGE OPERATION, MINET, TO AON CORPORATION. SPC

AGREED TO INDEMNIFY AON AGAINST ANY FUTURE CLAIMS FOR PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND OTHER SPECIFIED EVENTS THAT OCCURRED OR EXISTED PRIOR TO THE SALE. THE COMPANY

ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THIS INDEMNIFICATION UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER. THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE UNDER THESE CLAIMS ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES RESERVES FOR REPORTED

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCES REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED

BY MANAGEMENT, ARE UNDER THE GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF THE COMPANY'S AUDIT COMMITTEE.

THE

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.



PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF

ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OR COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT

HAS ASSESSED THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE STANDARD MEASURES ADOPTED BY MANAGEMENT IN MAKING ITS EVALUATION ARE

THE MEASURES IN THE INTERNAL-CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK PUBLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.
