item1.business
the travelers companies,inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the company) is a holding company principally
engaged, through its subsidiaries, in providing a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations and
individuals. the company is incorporated as a general business corporation under the laws of the state of minnesota and is one of the oldest insurance organizations in the united states, dating back
to 1853. the principal executive offices of the company are located
at 485 lexington avenue, new york, new york 10017, and its telephone number is (917)778-6000. the company also maintains executive offices in hartford, connecticut, and st.paul,
minnesota. the term "trv" in this document refers to the travelers companies,inc., the parent holding company excluding subsidiaries.
for
a summary of the company's revenues, operating income and total assets by reportable business segments, see note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
property and casualty insurance operations
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive in the areas of price, service, product offerings, agent
relationships and methods of distribution. distribution methods include the use of independent agents, exclusive agents, direct marketing and/or salaried employees. according
toa.m.best, there are approximately 1,275 property and casualty groups in the united states, comprising approximately 2,700 property and casualty companies. of those groups, the top
150 accounted for approximately 92% of the consolidated industry's total net written premiums in 2013. the company competes with both foreign and domestic insurers. in addition, several property and
casualty insurers writing commercial lines of business, including the company, offer products for alternative forms of risk protection in addition to traditional insurance products. these products
include large deductible programs and various forms of self-insurance, some of which utilize captive insurance companies and risk retention groups. the company's competitive position in the
marketplace is based on many factors, including the following:
premiums charged;
contract terms and conditions;
products and services offered;
claim service;
agent, broker and client relationships;
local presence;
geographic scope of business;
overall financial strength;
ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;
experience and qualifications of employees; and
technology and information systems.
in
addition, the marketplace is affected by available capacity of the insurance industry, as measured by statutory capital and surplus, and the availability of reinsurance from both
traditional sources, such as reinsurance companies, and non-traditional sources, such as hedge funds and pension plans. industry capacity as measured by statutory capital and surplus expands and
contracts primarily in conjunction with profit levels generated by the industry, less amounts returned to shareholders through
table of contents
dividends
and share repurchases. capital raised by debt and equity offerings may also increase statutory capital and surplus.
pricing and underwriting
pricing of the company's property and casualty insurance products is generally developed based upon an estimation of expected losses,
the expenses associated with producing, issuing and servicing business and managing claims, the time value of money related to the expected loss and expense cash flows, and a reasonable allowance for
profit that considers the capital needed to support the company's business. the company has a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that emphasizes product returns and profitable
growth over the long-term rather than premium volume or market share. the company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations regarding rate and policy form approvals. the
applicable state laws and regulations establish standards in certain lines of business to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or used to engage in unfair price
competition. the company's ability to increase rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each respective state's requirements, as well as the competitive market environment.

catastrophe exposure
the wide geographic distribution of the company's property and casualty insurance operations exposes it to claims arising out of
catastrophes. the company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to continually monitor and analyze
table of contents
underwriting
risks of business in natural catastrophe-prone areas and target risk areas for conventional terrorist attacks (defined as attacks other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological
events). the company relies, in part, upon these analyses to make underwriting decisions designed to manage its exposure on catastrophe-exposed business. for example, as a result of these analyses,
the company has limited the writing of new property and homeowners business in some markets and has selectively taken underwriting actions on new and existing business. these underwriting actions on
new and existing business include tightened underwriting standards, selective price increases and changes to deductibles specific to hurricane-, tornado-, wind- and hail-prone areas. see
"item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscatastrophe modeling" and "changing climate conditions." the
company also utilizes reinsurance to manage its aggregate exposures to catastrophes. see "reinsurance."
segment realignment
on june10, 2014, the company announced a realignment of its management team, effective july1, 2014, that gave rise to a
realignment of two of its three reportable business segments, as follows:
the company's international insurance group, which had previously been included in the financial, professional& international
insurance segment, was combined with the company's previous business insurance segment to create a new business and international insurance segment.
the bond& financial products group, which comprised the remaining businesses in the financial, professional&
international insurance segment, now comprises the new bond& specialty insurance segment.
the personal insurance segment was not impacted by these changes.
the
realignment of segments described above was made to reflect the realignment of the company's senior management responsibilities and the manner in which the company's businesses have
been managed starting july1, 2014, and the aggregation of products and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which risks are underwritten.
the
following discussion of the company's reportable business segments reflects the realigned segment reporting structure. financial data for all prior periods presented was reclassified
to be consistent with the 2014 presentation.
business and international insurance
the business and international insurance segment offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance related services
to its clients, primarily in the united states, as well as in canada, the united kingdom, the republic of ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of lloyd's. business and

principal markets and methods of distribution
the business and international insurance segment distributes its products through approximately 11,400 independent agencies and
brokers. agencies and brokers are serviced by 133 field offices and three customer service centers.
business
and international insurance continues to make significant investments in enhanced technology utilizing internet-based applications to provide real-time interface capabilities
with independent agencies and brokers. business and international insurance builds relationships with well-established, independent insurance agencies and brokers. in selecting new independent
agencies and brokers to distribute its products, business and international insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency's or broker's financial strength, staff experience and strategic
fit with the company's operating and marketing plans. once an agency or broker is appointed, business and international insurance carefully monitors its performance. the majority of products offered
in the united states are distributed through a common base of independent agents and brokers, many of whom also sell the company's personal insurance products. additionally, several operations may
underwrite business with agents that specialize in servicing the needs of certain of the industries served by these operations.
table of contents
select accounts is a leading provider of commercial property and casualty insurance
products to small businesses in the u.s., generally with fewer than 50 employees, and sells these products through a large network of independent agents and brokers. products offered by select
accounts are guaranteed-cost policies, including packaged products covering property and liability exposures. each small business risk is independently evaluated via an automated underwriting platform
which in turn enables agents to quote, bind and issue a substantial amount of new small business risks at their desktop in an efficient manner that significantly reduces the time period between
quoting a price on a new policy and issuing that policy. risks with more complex characteristics are underwritten with the assistance of company personnel. select accounts has established a strong
marketing relationship with its distribution network and has provided this network with defined underwriting policies, a broad array of products and competitive prices. in addition, the company has
established centralized service centers to help agents perform many service functions, in return for a fee.
middle market sells a broad range of commercial property and casualty insurance
products and services through a large network of independent agents and brokers, primarily targeting mid-sized businesses in the u.s. with 50 to 1,000 employees. the company offers a full line of
products to its middle market customers with an emphasis on guaranteed cost programs. each account is underwritten based on the unique risk characteristics, loss history and coverage needs of the
account. the ability to underwrite at this detailed level allows middle market to have a broad risk appetite and a diversified customer base. within middle market, products and services are tailored
to certain targeted industry segments of significant size and complexity that require unique underwriting, claim, risk management or other insurance-related products and services.
national accounts sells a variety of casualty products and services to large companies
in the u.s. through a network of national and regional brokers, primarily utilizing loss-sensitive products in connection with a large deductible or self-insured program and, to a lesser extent, a
retrospectively rated or a guaranteed cost insurance policy. national accounts also provides casualty products and services through retail brokers on an unbundled basis, using third-party
administrators for insureds who utilize programs such as collateralized deductibles, captive reinsurers and self-insurance. national accounts provides insurance-related services, such as risk
management services, claims administration, loss control and risk management information services, either in addition to, or in lieu of, pure risk coverage, and generated $251million of fee
income in 2014, excluding commercial residual market business. the commercial residual market business of national accounts sells claims and policy management services to workers' compensation pools
throughout the united states, and generated $132million of fee income in 2014. national accounts services approximately 34% of the total workers' compensation assigned risk market, making the
company one of the largest servicing carriers in the industry. workers' compensation accounted for approximately 76% of sales to national accounts customers during 2014, based on direct written
premiums and fees.
first party markets commercial property and casualty insurance products and services
through a large network of agents and brokers to a wide customer base in the u.s. having specialized property and casualty coverage requirements. first party provides traditional and customized
property insurance programs to large and mid-sized customers, insurance for goods in transit and movable objects, builders' risk insurance, insurance for the marine transportation industry and related
services, as well as other businesses involved in international trade. in addition, first party provides comprehensive breakdown coverages for equipment, including property and business interruption
coverages.
specialized distribution distributes admitted as well as excess and surplus lines
property and casualty products predominantly through selected brokers, wholesale agents, program managers
table of contents
and
specialized retail agents, including on a brokerage and delegated authority underwriting basis. these brokers, wholesale agents, program managers and specialized retail agents operate in certain
markets in the u.s. that are not typically served by the company's appointed retail agents, or they maintain certain affinity arrangements in specialized market segments. the wholesale excess and
surplus lines market, which is characterized by the absence of rate and form regulation, allows for more flexibility to write certain classes of business. in working with agents or program managers on
a brokerage basis, specialized distribution underwrites the business and sets the premium level. in working with agents or program managers with delegated underwriting authority, the agents produce
and underwrite business subject to underwriting guidelines that have been specifically designed for each facility or program.
international distributes its products, principally through brokers, in each of the
countries in which it operates. international also writes business at lloyd's, where its products are distributed through lloyd's wholesale and retail brokers. by virtue of lloyd's worldwide licenses,
the business and international insurance segment has access to international markets across the world.
pricing and underwriting
business and international insurance utilizes underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product development disciplines for
particular industries, in conjunction with extensive amounts of proprietary data gathered and analyzed over many years, to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters. the
company utilizes both standard industry forms and proprietary forms for the insurance policies it issues.
a
portion of business in this segment, particularly in national accounts and construction, is written with large deductible insurance policies. under workers' compensation insurance
contracts with deductible features, the company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. the company is subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount
and is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. at december31, 2014, contractholder payables on unpaid losses within the deductible layer of large deductible policies and the
associated receivables were each approximately $4.36billion. business and international insurance also utilizes retrospectively rated policies for another portion of the business, primarily
for workers' compensation coverage. although the retrospectively rated feature of the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the company, it introduces additional credit risk to the company.
premium receivables from holders of retrospectively rated policies totaled approximately $89million at december31, 2014. significant collateral, primarily letters of credit and, to a
lesser extent, cash collateral or trusts, is generally obtained for large deductible plans and/or retrospectively rated policies that provide for deferred collection of deductible recoveries and/or
ultimate premiums. the amount of collateral requested is predicated upon the creditworthiness of the customer and the nature of the insured risks. business and international insurance continually
monitors the credit exposure on individual accounts and the adequacy of collateral. for additional information concerning credit risk in certain of the company's businesses, see
"item1arisk factorswe are exposed to credit risk in certain of our business and investment operations including reinsurance or structured settlements."
product lines
the business and international insurance segment writes the following types of coverages:
domestic
workers'
compensation.provides coverage for employers for specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to
employees. there are typically four types of benefits payable under workers' compensation policies: medical benefits, disability benefits, death
table of contents
benefits
and vocational rehabilitation benefits. the company emphasizes managed care cost containment strategies, which involve employers, employees and care providers in a cooperative effort that
focuses on the injured employee's early return to work and cost-effective quality care. the company offers the following types of workers' compensation products:
guaranteed-cost insurance products, in which policy premium charges are fixed for the period of coverage and do not vary
as a result of the insured's loss experience;
loss-sensitive insurance products, including large deductible and retrospectively rated policies, in which fees or
premiums are adjusted based on actual loss experience of the insured during the policy period; and
service programs, which are generally sold to the company's national accounts customers, where the company receives fees
rather than premiums for providing loss prevention, risk management, and claim and benefit administration services to organizations under service agreements.
the
company also participates in state assigned risk pools as a servicing carrier and pool participant.
commercial
automobile.provides coverage for businesses against losses incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties,
property damage to an insured's vehicle and property damage to other vehicles and other property resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks in a business.
commercial
property.provides coverage for loss of or damage to buildings, inventory and equipment from a variety of events, including, among
others, hurricanes and other windstorms, tornadoes, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, theft, vandalism, fires, explosions, terrorism and
financial loss due to business interruption resulting from covered property damage. for additional information on terrorism coverages, see "reinsurancecatastrophe
reinsuranceterrorism risk insurance program." property also includes specialized equipment insurance, which provides coverage for loss or damage resulting from the mechanical breakdown of
boilers and machinery, and ocean and inland marine insurance, which provides coverage for goods in transit and unique, one-of-a-kind exposures.
general
liability.provides coverages for businesses against third-party claims arising from accidents occurring on their premises or arising
out of their operations, including as a result of injuries sustained from products sold. specialized liability policies may also include coverage for directors' and officers' liability arising in
their official capacities, employment practices liability insurance, fiduciary liability for trustees and sponsors of pension, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans, errors and
omissions insurance for employees, agents, professionals and others arising from acts or failures to act under specified circumstances, as well as umbrella and excess insurance.
commercial
multi-peril.provides a combination of the property and liability coverages described in the foregoing product line descriptions.
international
provides coverage for auto and motor (similar to automobile coverage in the united states), personal property, employers' liability
(similar to workers' compensation coverage in the united states), public and product liability (the equivalent of general liability), professional indemnity (similar to professional liability
coverage), commercial property, surety, marine, aviation, personal accident and kidnap& ransom. marine provides coverage for ship hulls, cargoes carried, private yachts, marine-related
liability, offshore energy, ports and terminals, fine art and
table of contents
terrorism.
aviation provides coverage for worldwide aviation risks including physical damage and liabilities for airline, aerospace, general aviation, aviation war and space risks. personal accident
provides financial protection in the event of death or disablement due to accidental bodily injury, while
kidnap& ransom provides financial protection against kidnap, hijack, illegal detention and extortion. while the covered hazards may be similar to those in the u.s. market, the different legal
environments can make the product risks and coverage terms potentially very different from those the company faces in the united states.
net retention policy per risk
the following discussion reflects the company's retention policy with respect to the business and international insurance segment as of
january1, 2015. for third-party liability, business and international insurance generally limits its net retention, through the use of reinsurance, to a maximum of $18.8million per
insured, per occurrence. for property exposures, business and international insurance generally limits its net retained amount per risk to $20.0million per occurrence, after reinsurance.
business and international insurance generally retains its workers' compensation exposures. reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per-risk retentions
if the aggregate limits or caps are reached. business and international insurance utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk
basis. business and international insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

competition
the insurance industry is represented in the commercial marketplace by many insurance companies of varying size as well as other
entities offering risk alternatives, such as self-insured retentions or captive programs. market competition works within the insurance regulatory framework to set the price charged for insurance
products and the levels of coverage and service provided. a company's success in the competitive commercial insurance landscape is largely measured by its ability to profitably provide insurance and
services, including claims handling and risk control, at prices and terms that retain existing customers and attract new customers.
domestic
competitors typically write select accounts business through independent agents and, to a lesser extent, regional brokers and as direct
writers. both national and regional property and casualty insurance companies compete in the select accounts market which generally comprises lower-hazard, "main street" business customers. risks are
underwritten and priced using standard industry practices and a combination of proprietary and standard industry product offerings. competition in this market is primarily based on product offerings,
service levels, ease of doing business and price.
competitors
typically write middle market business through independent agents and brokers. several of middle market's operations require unique combinations of industry knowledge,
customized coverage, specialized risk control and loss handling services, along with partnerships with agents and brokers that also focus on these markets. competitors in this market are primarily
national property and casualty insurance companies that write most classes of business using traditional products and pricing, and regional insurance companies. companies compete based on product
offerings, service levels, price and claim and loss prevention services. efficiency through automation and rapid response time to agent, broker and customer needs is one key to success in this market.

the national accounts market, competition is based on price, product offerings, claim and loss prevention services, managed care cost containment, risk management information systems
and collateral requirements. national accounts primarily competes with national property and casualty
insurance companies, as well as with other underwriters of property and casualty insurance in the alternative risk transfer market, such as self-insurance plans, captives managed by others, and a
variety of other risk-financing vehicles and mechanisms. the residual market division competes for state contracts to provide claims and policy management services.
first
party and specialized distribution compete in focused target markets. each of these markets is different and requires unique combinations of industry knowledge, customized
coverage, specialized risk control and loss handling services, along with partnerships with agents and brokers that also focus on these markets. some of these businesses compete with national carriers
with similarly dedicated underwriting and marketing groups, whereas others compete with smaller regional companies. each of these businesses has regional structures that allow them to deliver
personalized service and local knowledge to their customer base. specialized agents and brokers, including wholesale agents and program managers, supplement this strategy. in all of these businesses,
the competitive strategy typically is the application of focused industry knowledge to insurance and risk needs.
international
international competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in canada, the united kingdom and the republic of ireland.
companies compete on the basis of price, product offerings and the level of claim and risk management services provided. the company has developed expertise in various markets in these countries
similar to those served in the united states and provides both property and casualty coverage for these markets.

principal markets and methods of distribution
bond& specialty insurance distributes the vast majority of its products in the united states through approximately 6,000 of the
same independent agencies and brokers that distribute the business and international insurance segment's products in the u.s. the bond& specialty insurance segment, in conjunction with the
business and international insurance segment, continues to make investments in enhanced technology utilizing internet-based applications to provide real-time interface capabilities with its
independent agencies and brokers. bond& specialty insurance builds relationships with well-established, independent insurance agencies and brokers. in selecting new independent agencies and
brokers to distribute its products, bond& specialty insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency's or broker's profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic
fit with its operating and marketing plans. once an agency or broker is appointed, its ongoing performance is closely monitored.
pricing and underwriting
bond& specialty insurance utilizes underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product development disciplines for
specific accounts and industries, in conjunction with extensive amounts of proprietary data gathered and analyzed over many years, to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing
parameters. the company utilizes both standard industry forms and proprietary forms for the insurance policies it issues.
table of contents
product lines
the bond& specialty insurance segment writes the following types of coverages:
fidelity and
surety.provides fidelity insurance coverage, which protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an
employee, and surety, which is a three-party agreement whereby the insurer agrees to pay a third party or make complete an obligation in response to the default, acts or omissions of an insured.
surety is generally provided for construction performance, legal matters such as appeals, trustees in bankruptcy and probate and other performance bonds.
general
liability.provides coverage for specialized liability exposures as described above in more detail in the "business and international
insurance" section of this report.
other.coverages include property, workers' compensation, commercial automobile and
commercial multi-peril, which are described above in more detail in the "business and international insurance" section of this report.
net retention policy per risk
the following discussion reflects the company's retention policy with respect to the bond& specialty insurance segment as of
january1, 2015. for third party liability, including but not limited to umbrella liability, professional liability, directors' and officers' liability, and employment practices liability,
bond& specialty insurance generally limits net retentions to $25.0million per policy. for surety protection, where insured limits are often significant, bond& specialty
insurance generally retains up to $115.0million probable maximum loss (pml) per principal but may retain higher amounts based on the type of obligation, credit quality and other credit risk
factors. reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached. bond& specialty insurance
utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. bond& specialty insurance may also retain amounts greater than those
described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

table of contents
competition
the competitive landscape in which the bond& specialty insurance segment operates is affected by many of the same factors
described previously for the business and international insurance segment. competitors in this market are primarily national property and casualty insurance companies that write most classes of
business and, to a lesser extent, regional insurance companies and companies that have developed niche programs for specific industry segments.
bond&
specialty insurance underwrites and markets its products to all sizes of businesses and other organizations, as well as individuals. the company believes that its
reputation for timely and consistent decision making, a nationwide network of local underwriting, claims and industry experts and strong producer and customer relationships, as well as its ability to
offer its customers a full range of products, provides bond& specialty insurance an advantage over many of its competitors and enables it to compete effectively in a complex, dynamic
marketplace. the company believes that the ability of the bond& specialty insurance segment to cross-sell its products to customers of the business and international insurance and personal
insurance segments provides additional competitive advantages for the company.
personal insurance
the company's personal insurance segment writes a broad range of property and casualty insurance covering individuals' personal risks.
the primary products of automobile and homeowners insurance are complemented by a broad suite of related coverages.

principal markets and methods of distribution
personal insurance products are distributed primarily through approximately 11,100 active independent agencies located throughout the
united states, supported by personnel in nine sales regions. in addition, sales and service are provided to customers through five contact centers. while the principal markets for personal insurance
products continue to be in states along the east coast, california and texas, the business continues to expand its geographic presence across the united states. see "competition" below for a
discussion of the company's newest private passenger automobile product, quantum auto 2.0.
in
selecting new independent agencies to distribute its products, personal insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency's profitability, financial stability, staff experience
and strategic fit with the segment's operating and marketing plans. once an agency is appointed, personal insurance carefully monitors its performance.
agents
can access the company's agency service portal for a number of resources including customer service, marketing and claims management. in addition, agencies can choose to shift the
table of contents
ongoing
service responsibility for personal insurance's customers to one of the company's customer care centers, where the company provides, on behalf of an agency, a comprehensive array of customer
service needs, including response to billing and coverage inquiries, and policy changes. approximately 1,600 agents take advantage of this service alternative, for which they generally pay a fee.
personal
insurance also distributes its products through additional channels, including corporations that make the company's product offerings available to their employees primarily
through payroll deduction, consumer associations and affinity groups. personal insurance handles the sales and service for these programs either through a sponsoring independent agent or through the
company's contact center locations. in addition, since 1995, the company has had a marketing agreement with geico to underwrite homeowners business for certain of their auto customers.
in
2009, the company began marketing its insurance products directly to consumers, largely through online channels. the investment in the direct-to-consumer initiative has generated
growing but still modest premium volume for personal insurance in recent years, which was consistent with the company's expectations. the direct-to-consumer initiative, while intended to enhance the
company's long-term ability to compete successfully in a consumer-driven marketplace, is expected to remain modest with respect to premium volume and remain unprofitable for a number of years as the
company continues to develop, test and evaluate this distribution channel.
pricing and underwriting
personal insurance has developed a product management methodology that integrates the disciplines of underwriting, claim, actuarial and
product development. this approach is designed to maintain high quality underwriting discipline and pricing segmentation. proprietary data accumulated over many years is analyzed and personal
insurance uses a variety of risk differentiation models to facilitate its pricing segmentation. the company's product management area establishes underwriting guidelines integrated with its filed
pricing and rating plans, which enable personal insurance to effectively execute its risk selection and pricing processes.
pricing
for personal automobile insurance is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and by inflation in the cost of automobile repairs, medical care and litigation of
liability claims. pricing in the homeowners business is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and by inflation in the cost of building supplies, labor and household possessions.
in addition to the normal risks associated with any multiple peril coverage, the profitability and pricing of both homeowners and automobile insurance are affected by the incidence of natural
disasters, particularly those related to weather and, for homeowners insurance, earthquakes. insurers writing personal lines property and casualty policies may be unable to increase prices until some
time after the costs associated with coverage have increased, primarily because of state insurance rate regulation. the pace at which an insurer can change rates in response to increased costs
depends, in part, on whether the applicable state law requires prior approval of rate increases or notification to the regulator either before or after a rate change is imposed. in states with prior
approval laws, rates must be approved by the regulator before being used by the insurer. in states having "file-and-use" laws, the insurer must file rate changes with the regulator, but does not need
to wait for approval before using the new rates. a "use-and-file" law requires an insurer to file rates within a period of time after the insurer begins using the new rate. approximately one-half of
the states require prior approval of most rate changes. in addition, changes to methods of marketing and underwriting in some jurisdictions are subject to state-imposed
restrictions, which can make it more difficult for an insurer to significantly manage catastrophe exposures.
the
company's ability or willingness to raise prices, modify underwriting terms or reduce exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public policy, the
competitive environment, the evolving political environment and/or changes in the general economic climate. the
table of contents
company
also may choose to write business it might not otherwise write in some states for strategic purposes, such as improving access to other commercial or personal underwriting opportunities. in
choosing to write business in some states, the company also considers the costs and benefits of those states' residual markets and guaranty funds, as well as other property and casualty business the
company writes in those states.
product lines
the primary coverages in personal insurance are personal automobile and homeowners and other insurance sold to individuals. personal
insurance had approximately 6.2million active policies (e.g.,policies-in-force) at december31, 2014.
the
personal insurance segment writes the following types of coverages:
personal automobile provides coverage for liability to others for both bodily injury
and property damage, uninsured motorist protection, and for physical damage to an insured's own vehicle from collision, fire, flood, hail and theft. in addition, many states require policies to
provide first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.
homeowners and other provides protection against losses to dwellings and contents from
a variety of perils (excluding flooding) as well as coverage for personal liability. the company writes homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and tenants, and rental properties. the company
also writes coverage for boats and yachts and valuable personal items such as jewelry, and also writes coverages for umbrella liability, identity fraud, and weddings and special events.
net retention policy per risk
the following discussion reflects the company's retention policy with respect to the personal insurance segment as of january1,
2015. personal insurance generally retains its primary personal auto exposures in their entirety. for personal property insurance, there is an $8.0million maximum retention per risk. personal
insurance issues umbrella policies up to a maximum limit of $10.0million per risk. personal insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual
characteristics of the risk.

competition
although national companies write the majority of this business, personal insurance also faces competition from many regional and
hundreds of local companies. personal insurance primarily competes based on breadth of product offerings, price, service (including claims handling), ease of doing business, stability of the insurer
and name recognition. personal insurance competes for business within each independent agency since these agencies also offer policies of competing companies. at the agency level, competition is
primarily based on price, service (including claims handling), the level of automation and the development of long-term relationships with individual agents. in recent years, most independent personal
insurance agents have begun utilizing price comparison rating technology, sometimes referred to as "comparative raters," as a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple companies. because
the use of this technology facilitates the process of generating multiple quotes, the technology has increased price comparison on new business and, increasingly, on renewal business. personal
insurance also competes with insurance companies that use exclusive agents or salaried employees to sell their products, as well as those that employ direct marketing strategies. see
"item1arisk factorsthe intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability."
the
agency automobile line of business has been negatively impacted by various factors, including the use of price comparison technology by agents and brokers as discussed above. the
company's actions in response to these factors have included, among other things, the reduction of claim adjustment and other insurance expenses, with the majority of the impact in the agency
automobile line of business. at december31, 2014, these actions to reduce costs have resulted in an expected annual decrease of $140million in pre-tax expenses in 2015 when compared
with expense levels prior to their implementation. additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2013, the company launched its newest private passenger automobile product, quantum auto 2.0. this product, in
addition to incorporating
table of contents
the
cost savings described above, has a lower base commission rate than the company's existing quantum auto 1.0 product. these changes in cost structure enabled the company to price quantum auto 2.0
more competitively while maintaining expected returns at appropriate levels. by december31, 2014, the company offered quantum auto 2.0 in approximately 90% of the states where it plans to
offer the product, and the company currently expects that, by the end of 2015, it will offer the product in all of those states. the company intends that, in approved states, all new accounts will be
written using quantum auto 2.0. in addition, quantum auto 2.0 is available to agents at their discretion for existing accounts.
claims management
the company's claim functions are managed through its claims services organization, with locations in the united states and in the
countries where it does business. with more than 11,000 employees, claims services employs a group of professionals with diverse skills, including claim adjusters, appraisers, attorneys,
investigators, engineers, accountants, system specialists and training, management and support personnel. approved external service providers, such as investigators, attorneys and, in the rare
circumstances when necessary, independent adjusters and appraisers, are available for use as appropriate.
u.s.
field claim management teams located in 21 claim centers and 53 satellite and specialty-only offices in 45 states are organized to maintain focus on the specific claim
characteristics unique to the businesses within the company's business segments. claim teams with specialized skills, required licenses, resources and workflows are matched to the unique exposures of
those businesses, with local claims management dedicated to achieving optimal results within each segment. the company's home office operations provide additional support in the form of workflow
design, quality management, information technology, advanced management information and data analysis, training, financial reporting and control, and human resources strategy. this structure permits
the company to maintain the economies of scale of a large, established company while retaining the agility to respond promptly to the needs of customers, brokers, agents and underwriters. claims
management for international, while generally provided locally by staff in the respective international locations due to local knowledge of applicable laws and regulations, is also managed by the
company's claims services organization in the u.s. to leverage that knowledge base and to share best practices.
an
integral part of the company's strategy to benefit customers and shareholders is its continuing industry leadership in the fight against insurance fraud through its investigative
services unit. the company has a nationwide staff of experts who investigate a wide array of insurance fraud schemes using in-house forensic resources and other technological tools. this staff also
has specialized expertise in fire scene examinations, medical provider fraud schemes and data mining. the company also dedicates investigative resources to ensure that violations of law are reported
to and prosecuted by law enforcement agencies.
claims
services uses technology, management information and data analysis to assist the company in reviewing its claim practices and results in order to evaluate and improve its claims
management performance. the company's claims management strategy is focused on segmentation of claims and appropriate technical specialization to drive effective claim resolution. the company
continually monitors its investment in claim resources to maintain an effective focus on claim outcomes and a disciplined approach to continual improvement. the company operates a state-of-the-art
claims training facility which offers hands-on experiential learning to help ensure that its claim professionals are properly trained. in recent years, the company has invested significant additional
resources in many of its claim handling operations and routinely monitors the effect of those investments to ensure a consistent optimization among outcomes, cost and service.
claims
services' catastrophe response strategy is to respond to a significant catastrophic event using its own personnel, enabling it to minimize reliance on independent adjusters and
appraisers. the
table of contents
company
has developed a large dedicated catastrophe response team and trained a large enterprise response team of existing employees who can be deployed on short notice in the event of a catastrophe
that generates claim volume exceeding the capacity of the dedicated catastrophe response team. in recent years, these internal resources were successfully deployed to respond to a record number of
catastrophe claims.
reinsurance
the company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to manage its exposure to losses and to protect its capital. the
company cedes to reinsurers a portion of these risks and pays premiums based upon the risk and exposure of the policies subject to such reinsurance. ceded reinsurance involves credit risk, except with
regard to mandatory pools and associations, and is predominantly subject to aggregate loss limits. although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the company
remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts. the company
also holds collateral, including trust agreements, escrow funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. the company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing
basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically. reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices, the price of their product offerings and the value of
collateral provided. after reinsurance is purchased, the company has limited ability to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer. in addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the european
union and the united kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the
transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority. for additional information concerning reinsurance, see note5 of notes to the company's consolidated financial
statements and "item1arisk factors."
the
company utilizes a variety of reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to large property and casualty losses, including:
facultative reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for all or a portion of the insurance provided by a single policy and each
policy reinsured is separately negotiated;
quota share reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for an agreed-upon fixed percentage of liabilities, premiums and losses for
each policy covered on a pro rata basis;
treaty reinsurance, in which reinsurance is provided for a specified type or category of risks; and
catastrophe reinsurance, in which the company is indemnified for an agreed upon amount of contractual loss in excess of a specified
retention with respect to losses resulting from a catastrophic event.
for
a description of reinsurance-related litigation, see note16 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
included
in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal
physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life
insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the company's consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as the company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. if it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the company would
recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. in the event that the life insurance
company fails to make the required annuity payments, the company would be required to make such payments.
table of contents
catastrophe reinsurance
catastrophes can be caused by a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes,
hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. catastrophes can also result from terrorist attacks and other
intentionally destructive acts (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), explosions and infrastructure failures. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are
inherently unpredictable. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. most
catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those areas that are heavily populated. the
company generally seeks to manage its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. the company utilizes corporate catastrophe excess-of-loss
reinsurance treaties with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage its exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes and to protect its capital. in addition to the coverage provided under these treaties,
the company also utilizes catastrophe bonds to protect against hurricane losses in the northeastern united states, and a northeast catastrophe reinsurance treaty to protect against losses resulting
from weather-related and earthquake catastrophes in the northeastern united states. the company also utilizes excess-of-loss treaties to protect against earthquake losses up to a
certain threshold in the business and international insurance segment (for certain markets) and for the personal insurance segment, and several reinsurance treaties specific to its international
operations.
corporate catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty.for the period january1, 2015 to december31, 2015, the company has
entered
into a reinsurance agreement that covers the accumulation of certain property losses arising from one or multiple occurrences: 75% ($1.50billion) of qualifying losses covered by the treaty and
25% ($500million) of qualifying losses retained by the company part of $2.0billion excess of $3.0billion. qualifying losses for each occurrence are after a $100million
deductible. the treaty covers all of the company's exposures in the united states and canada and their territories and possessions, the caribbean islands, mexico and all waters contiguous thereto. the
treaty only provides coverage for terrorism events in limited circumstances and excludes entirely losses arising from nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. this treaty replaced the
company's general catastrophe reinsurance treaty, which was cancelled on a cut-off basis effective december31, 2014, and the general catastrophe aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty,
which expired on december31, 2014.
catastrophe bonds.the company has catastrophe protection through two indemnity reinsurance agreements with long point re iiiltd.
(long point
re iii), an independent cayman islands company licensed as a classb insurer in the cayman islands. the reinsurance agreements expire in june 2015 and may 2016, respectively, and provide
coverage to the company for certain losses from a hurricane in the northeastern united states. both reinsurance agreements meet the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with
the guidance for reinsurance contracts. in connection with each reinsurance agreement, long point re iii issued notes (generally referred to as "catastrophe bonds") to investors in an amount equal to
the full coverage provided under the respective reinsurance agreement as described below.
on
june6, 2012, long point re iii completed an offering to unrelated investors of $250million aggregate principal amount of catastrophe bonds. in connection with the
offering, the company and long point re iii entered into a three-year reinsurance agreement providing coverage to the company for certain losses from a hurricane in the northeastern united states. the
proceeds of the offering were deposited in a reinsurance trust account. the attachment point, maximum limit and insurance percentage are reset annually to maintain modeled probabilities of attachment
and expected loss on the respective catastrophe bonds equal to the initial modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss. the attachment point, maximum limit and insurance percentage were
reset in april 2014. accordingly,
table of contents
for
the period may1, 2014 through june6, 2015, the company will be entitled to begin recovering amounts under the reinsurance agreement if the losses in the covered area for a single
occurrence reach an initial attachment amount of $1.772billion. the full $250million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until covered losses reach a maximum
$2.331billion.
on
may16, 2013, long point re iii completed a second offering to unrelated investors of $300million aggregate principal amount of catastrophe bonds. in connection with
the offering, the company and long point re iii entered into a three-year reinsurance agreement providing for coverage to the company for certain losses from a hurricane in the northeastern united
states. similar to the first arrangement with long point re iii, the proceeds of the offering were deposited in a reinsurance trust account. the attachment point and maximum limit are reset annually,
with the ability of the company to adjust the expected loss of the coverage layer (the difference between the attachment point and the maximum limit) within a predetermined range. the attachment
point, maximum limit and insurance percentage were reset in april 2014. accordingly, for the period may17, 2014 through may16, 2015, the company will be entitled to begin recovering
amounts under the reinsurance agreement if the losses in the covered area for a single occurrence reach an initial attachment amount of $1.222billion. the full $300million coverage
amount is available on a proportional basis until covered losses reach a maximum $1.772billion.
the
business covered by these reinsurance agreements is a subset of the company's overall insurance portfolio, comprising property insurance and related coverages spread across the
following geographic locations: connecticut, delaware, district of columbia, maine, maryland, massachusetts, new hampshire, new jersey, new york, pennsylvania, rhode island, virginia and vermont. the
coverage under both reinsurance agreements is limited to specified property coverage written in the company's personal insurance segment, and within select accounts and commercial accounts in the
company's business and international insurance segment.
under
the terms of both reinsurance agreements, the company is obligated to pay annual reinsurance premiums to long point re iii for the reinsurance coverage. amounts payable to the
company under both reinsurance agreements with respect to any covered event cannot exceed the company's actual losses from such event. the principal amount of the respective catastrophe bond will be
reduced by any amounts paid to the company under the respective reinsurance agreement.
as
with any reinsurance agreement, there is credit risk associated with collecting amounts due from reinsurers. with regard to long point re iii, the credit risk is mitigated by
reinsurance trust accounts that have been funded by long point re iii with money market funds that invest solely in direct government obligations and obligations backed by the u.s. government with
maturities of no more than 13months. the money market funds must have a principal stability rating of at least aaam by standard& poor's on the issuance date of the bonds and thereafter
must be rated by standard& poor's. other permissible investments include money market funds which invest in repurchase and reverse
repurchase agreements collateralized by direct government obligations and obligations of any agency backed by the u.s. government with terms of no more than 397 calendar days, and cash.
at
the time the agreements were entered into with long point re iii, the company evaluated the applicability of the accounting guidance that addresses variable interest entities or vies.
under this guidance, an entity that is formed for business purposes is considered a vie if: (a)the equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability through voting rights or similar rights
to make decisions about an entity's activities that have a significant effect on the entity's operations, or (b)the equity investors do not provide sufficient financial resources for the
entity to support its activities. additionally, a company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses from a vie's activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's expected residual
returns, or both, is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the vie and is required to consolidate the vie in the company's financial statements.
table of contents
as
a result of the evaluation of the reinsurance agreements with long point re iii, the company concluded that it was a vie because the conditions described in items(a) and
(b)above were present. however, while long point re iii was determined to be a vie, the company concluded that it did not have a variable interest in the entity, as the variability in its
results, caused by the reinsurance agreements, is expected to be absorbed entirely by the investors in the catastrophe bonds issued by long point re iii and residual amounts earned by it, if any, are
expected to be absorbed by the equity investors (the company has neither an equity nor a residual interest in long point re iii).
accordingly,
the company is not the primary beneficiary of long point re iii and does not consolidate that entity in the company's consolidated financial statements. additionally,
because the company has no intention to pursue any transaction that would result in it acquiring interest in and becoming the primary beneficiary of long point re iii, the consolidation of that entity
in the company's consolidated financial statements in future periods is unlikely.
the
company has not incurred any losses that have resulted or are expected to result in a recovery under the long point re iii agreements since their inception.
northeast general catastrophe reinsurance treaty.in addition to its corporate catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty and its
multi-year
catastrophe bonds, the company also is party to a northeast general catastrophe reinsurance treaty which provides up to $850million of coverage, subject to a $2.25billion retention,
for certain losses arising from hurricanes, tornados, hail storms, earthquakes and winter storm or freeze losses from virginia to maine for the period july1, 2014 through june30,
2015. losses from a covered event (occurring over several days) anywhere in the united states, canada, the caribbean and mexico and waters contiguous thereto may be used to satisfy the retention.
recoveries under the catastrophe bonds (if any) would be first applied to reduce losses subject to this treaty.
business and international insurance earthquake excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty.for the period july1, 2014 through
june30, 2015,
the company has entered into an earthquake excess-of-loss treaty that provides for up to $150million part of $165million of coverage, subject to a $60million retention, for
losses arising from an earthquake, including fire following and sprinkler leakage incurred under policies written by technology, public sector services and commercial accounts in the company's
business and international insurance segment.
personal insurance earthquake excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty.for the period january1, 2015 through december31, 2015, the
company
has entered into an earthquake excess-of-loss treaty that provides for up to $200million of coverage, subject to a $150million retention, for losses arising from an earthquake,
including fire following and sprinkler leakage incurred under policies written by the company's personal insurance segment.
canadian property catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance contract.this contract, effective for the period july1, 2014 through
and including
june30, 2015, covers the accumulation of net property losses arising out of one occurrence on business written by the company's canadian businesses. the treaty covers all property written by
the company's canadian businesses for canadian insureds, including, but not limited to, habitational property, commercial property, inland marine, ocean marine and auto physical damages exposures,
with respect to risks located worldwide, written for canadian insureds. the treaty provides coverage for 100% of loss retained in excess of c$50million (us$43million at
december31, 2014) up to c$900million (us$775million at december31, 2014).
other international reinsurance treaties.for other business underwritten in canada, as well as for business written in the united
kingdom, republic
of ireland and in the company's operations at lloyd's, separate reinsurance protections are purchased locally that have lower net retentions more commensurate with the size of the respective local
balance sheet. the company conducts an ongoing review of its risk and catastrophe coverages and makes changes as it deems appropriate.
table of contents
terrorism risk insurance program.the terrorism risk insurance program is a federal program administered by the department of the
treasury that
provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism. in january 2015, the program was reauthorized through
december31, 2020. for a further description of the program, including the company's estimated deductible under the program in 2015, see note5 of notes to the company's consolidated
financial statements and "item1arisk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or
liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance."
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment
expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported.
the
company continually refines its reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process that includes review of key assumptions, underlying variables and historical loss experience. the
company reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the periods in which the estimates are changed. in establishing reserves, the company takes into account estimated recoveries
for reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. the reserves are also reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company. for additional information on the process of estimating reserves and
a discussion of underlying variables and risk factors, see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical
accounting estimates."
the
process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables (discussed by product line in the "critical accounting
estimates" section of "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations") are affected by both internal and external events, such as
changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial trends and legislative changes, among others. the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is
difficult to estimate. reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in the underlying insurance contract (e.g., claims-made versus occurrence), claim
complexity, the volume of claims, the
potential severity of individual claims, the determination of the occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the insured event and when it is actually reported
to the insurer). informed judgment is applied throughout the process.
the
company derives estimates for unreported claims and development on reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of historical patterns of loss development by accident year for
each type of exposure and business unit. similarly, the company derives estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses principally from actuarial analyses of historical development patterns of the
relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business and type of exposure. for a description of the company's reserving methods for asbestos and environmental claims, see
"item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsasbestos claims and litigation," and "environmental claims and
litigation."
discounting
the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for most long-term disability and annuity claim payments, primarily arising from
workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies, were discounted to the present value of estimated future payments using a rate of 5% at both december31,
2014 and 2013. these discounted reserves totaled $2.01billion and $2.21billion at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
table of contents
claims and claim adjustment expense development table
the table that follows sets forth the year-end reserves from 2004 through 2014 and the subsequent changes in those reserves, presented
on a historical basis. the original estimates, cumulative amounts paid and re-estimated reserves in the table for 2004 through 2012 have not been restated to reflect the acquisition of dominion in
november 2013. the table includes dominion's reserves beginning at december31, 2013.
the
data in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the securities and exchange commission (sec). care must be taken to avoid misinterpretation by those
unfamiliar with this information or familiar with other data commonly reported by the insurance industry. the data in the table is not accident year data, but rather a display of 2004 to 2014 year-end
reserves and the subsequent changes in those reserves.
for
instance, the cumulative deficiency or redundancy shown in the table for each year represents the aggregate amount by which original estimates of reserves as of that year-end have
changed in subsequent years. accordingly, the cumulative deficiency or redundancy for a year relates only to reserves at that year-end and those amounts are not additive. expressed another way, if the
original reserves at the end of 2004 included $4million for a loss that is finally paid in 2008 for $5million, the $1million deficiency (the excess of the actual payment of
$5million over the original estimate of $4million) would be included in the cumulative deficiency for 2004 and would also be reflected as a reduction in the cumulative redundancies in
each of the years 2005 to 2007 shown in the accompanying table.
various
factors may distort the re-estimated reserves and cumulative deficiency or redundancy shown in the table. for example, a substantial portion of the cumulative deficiency shown in
the table for 2004 arise from claims on policies written prior to the mid-1980s involving liability exposures such as asbestos and environmental claims. in the post-1984 period, the company has
developed more stringent underwriting standards and policy exclusions and has significantly contracted or terminated the writing of these risks. see "item7management's discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsasbestos claims and litigation," and "environmental claims and litigation." general conditions and trends that
have affected the development of these liabilities in the past will not necessarily recur in the future.
other
factors that affect the data in the table include the discounting of certain reserves (as discussed above) and the use of retrospectively rated insurance policies. for example,
reserves for long-term disability and annuity claim payments (tabular reserves), primarily arising from workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies, are
discounted to reflect the time value of money. apparent deficiencies will continue to occur as the discount on these workers' compensation reserves is accreted at the appropriate interest rates. also,
a portion of national accounts business is underwritten with retrospectively rated insurance policies in which the ultimate loss experience is primarily borne by the insured. for this business,
increases in loss experience result in an increase in reserves and an offsetting increase in amounts recoverable from insureds. likewise, decreases in loss experience result in a decrease in reserves
and an offsetting decrease in amounts recoverable from these insureds. the amounts recoverable on these retrospectively rated policies mitigate the impact of the cumulative deficiencies or
redundancies on the company's earnings but are not reflected in the table.
table of contents
because
of these and other factors, it is difficult to develop a meaningful extrapolation of estimated future redundancies or deficiencies in loss reserves from the data in the table.

for
years prior to 2013, the table excludes reserves of dominion, which were acquired by the company on november1, 2013. accordingly, the reserve development for years prior to
2013 does not include reserve development recorded by dominion. at december31, 2013, dominion's gross reserves were $2,110million, and net reserves were $1,779million.
in
december 2008, the company completed the sale of unionamerica holdings limited (unionamerica), which comprised its united kingdom (u.k.)-based runoff insurance and reinsurance
businesses. immediately before the sale, the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves of unionamerica totaled $790million. as a result of the sale, those obligations ceased being the
responsibility of the company and its affiliates. the sale is reflected in the table as a reduction in december31, 2008 net reserves of $790million and as a $790million
increase in paid losses for each of the years 2004 through 2007 to reflect the transfer (payment) of the reserves to the buyer, resulting in no impact to incurred losses.

reserves on statutory accounting basis
at december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (net of reinsurance) shown in the preceding
table, which are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap reserves), were $29million higher, $17million higher and $22million lower,
respectively, than those reported in the company's respective annual reports filed with insurance regulators, which are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices (statutory reserves).
the
differences between gaap and statutory reserves are primarily due to the differences in gaap and statutory accounting for two items: (1)fees associated with billing of
required reimbursements under large deductible business, and (2)the accounting for retroactive reinsurance. for large deductible business, the company pays the deductible portion of a casualty
insurance claim and then seeks
reimbursement from the insured, plus a fee. this fee is reported as fee income for gaap reporting, but as an offset to claim expenses paid for statutory reporting. retroactive reinsurance balances
result from reinsurance placed to cover losses on insured events occurring prior to the inception of a reinsurance contract. for gaap reporting, retroactive reinsurance balances are included in
reinsurance recoverables and result in lower net reserve amounts. statutory accounting practices require retroactive reinsurance balances to be recorded in other liabilities as contra-liabilities
rather than in loss reserves.
asbestos and environmental claims
asbestos and environmental claims are segregated from other claims and are handled separately by the company's special liability group,
a separate unit staffed by dedicated legal, claim, finance and engineering professionals. for additional information on asbestos and environmental claims, see "item7management's
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsasbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation."
intercompany reinsurance pooling arrangements
most of the company's domestic insurance subsidiaries are members of an intercompany property and casualty reinsurance pooling
arrangement. pooling arrangements permit the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool's statutory capital and surplus rather than just on its own statutory capital and
surplus. under such arrangements, the members share substantially all insurance business that is written and allocate the combined premiums, losses and expenses.
table of contents
ratings
ratings are an important factor in assessing the company's competitive position in the insurance industry. the company receives ratings
from the following major rating agencies:a.m. best company (a.m. best), fitch ratings (fitch), moody's investors service (moody's) and standard& poor's corp. (s&p). rating agencies
typically issue two types of ratings for insurance companies: claims-paying (or financial strength) ratings which reflect the rating agency's assessment of an insurer's ability to meet its financial
obligations to policyholders, and debt ratings, which reflect the rating agency's assessment of a company's prospects for repaying its debts and are considered by lenders in connection with the
setting of interest rates and terms for a company's short- and long-term borrowings. agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and they may be revised or withdrawn at
any time by the rating agency. each agency's rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency's rating. the system and the number of rating categories can vary widely from rating agency to
rating agency. customers usually focus on claims-paying ratings, while creditors focus on debt ratings. investors use both to evaluate a company's overall financial strength. the ratings issued on the
company or its subsidiaries by any of these agencies are announced publicly and are available on the company's website and from the agencies.
a
downgrade in one or more of the company's claims-paying ratings could negatively impact the company's business volumes and competitive position because demand for certain of its
products may be reduced, particularly because some customers require that the company maintain minimum ratings to enter into or renew business with it.
additionally,
a downgrade in one or more of the company's debt ratings could adversely impact the company's ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds, including in
the syndicated bank loan market, and/or result in higher financing costs. for example, downgrades in the company's debt ratings could result in higher interest expense under the company's revolving
credit agreement (under which the cost of borrowing could range from libor plus 87.5 basis points to libor plus 150 basis points, depending on the company's debt ratings), the company's commercial
paper program, or in the event that the company were to access the capital markets by issuing debt or similar types of securities. see "item7management's discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources" for a discussion of the company's revolving credit agreement and commercial paper program. the company
considers the level of increased cash funding requirements in the event of a ratings downgrade as part of the evaluation of the company's liquidity requirements. the company currently believes that a
one- to two-notch downgrade in its debt ratings would not result in a material increase in interest expense under its existing credit agreement and commercial paper programs. in addition, the company
considers the impact of a ratings downgrade as part of the evaluation of its common share repurchases.

investment operations
the majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable u.s.
government, tax-exempt u.s. municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds. the company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and the company's
investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy its insurance and debt obligations. generally, the expected principal and interest payments
produced by the company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company's insurance reserves. the company's management of the duration of the fixed maturity investment
portfolio, including its use of treasury futures at times, has produced a duration that is less than the estimated duration of the company's net insurance liabilities. the substantial amount by which
the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality
liquid bonds, contributes to the company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.
the
company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. these
investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also involve varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.

regulation
u.s. state and federal regulation
trv's domestic insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact insurance business in all u.s. states, the district of
columbia, guam, puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands and are subject to regulation in the various states and jurisdictions in which they transact business. the extent of regulation varies, but
generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state. the regulation, supervision and administration relate,
among other things, to standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, premium rates, restrictions on
the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders,
approval of policy forms and the regulation of market conduct, including the use of credit information in underwriting as well as other underwriting and claims practices. in addition, many states have
enacted variations of competitive ratemaking laws, which allow insurers to set certain premium rates for certain classes of insurance without having to obtain the prior approval of the state insurance
department. state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of insurance companies and require the filing of financial and other reports on
a quarterly and annual basis.
state
insurance regulation continues to evolve in response to the changing economic and business environment as well as efforts by regulators internationally to develop a consistent
approach to regulations. while the u.s. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, in 2010, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act established a
federal insurance office (the fio) within the u.s. department of the treasury. while the fio has limited regulatory authority, it has been active in the discussions to develop international regulatory
standards for the insurance industry. in response to these international efforts, the state insurance regulators, through the national association of insurance commissioners, are working with the
federal reserve and fio to consider and develop changes to the u.s. regulatory framework. these changes are evidenced by the recent incorporation of supervisory colleges into the u.s. regulatory
framework. a supervisory college is a forum of the regulators having jurisdictional authority over a holding company's various insurance subsidiaries, including foreign insurance subsidiaries,
convened to meet with the insurer's executive management, to evaluate the insurer from both a group-wide and legal-entity basis. some of the items evaluated during the colleges include the insurer's
business strategies, enterprise risk management and corporate governance. the state of connecticut is the lead regulator for trv and conducts the supervisory colleges for the company.
insurance regulation concerning dividends from insurance subsidiaries.trv's principal domestic insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in
the state of
connecticut. the connecticut insurance holding company laws require notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend from an insurance
subsidiary that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurance subsidiary's statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding
december31, or the insurance subsidiary's net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding december31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting
practices and by state regulation. this declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.
the
insurance holding company laws of other states in which trv's domestic insurance subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more
restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends.
rate and rule approvals.trv's domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to each state's laws and regulations regarding rate and rule
approvals.
the applicable laws and regulations are used by
table of contents
states
to establish standards to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition. an insurer's ability to increase rates and the
relative timing of the process are dependent upon each respective state's requirements.
requirements for exiting geographic markets and/or canceling or nonrenewing policies.several states have laws and regulations which
may impact the
timing and/or the ability of an insurer to either discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in that state. these laws and regulations typically require prior notice, and in some instances
insurance department approval, prior to discontinuing a line of business or withdrawing from that state, and they allow insurers to cancel or non-renew certain policies only for certain specified
reasons.
assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other mandatory pooling and reinsurance
arrangements.virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state, including trv's domestic insurance subsidiaries, to bear a portion of
the loss suffered by some claimants because of the insolvency of other insurers. many states also have laws that establish second-injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for
aggravation of a prior condition or injury.
trv's
domestic insurance subsidiaries are also required to participate in various involuntary assigned risk pools, principally involving workers' compensation, automobile insurance,
property windpools in states prone to property damage from hurricanes and fair plans, which provide various insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase
that coverage in the voluntary market.
assessments
may include any charge mandated by statute or regulatory authority that is related directly or indirectly to underwriting activities. examples of such mechanisms include, but
are not limited to, the florida hurricane catastrophe fund, florida citizens property insurance corporation, national workers' compensation reinsurance pool, various workers' compensation related
funds (e.g.,the new york special disability fund), north carolina beach plan, louisiana citizens property insurance corporation, and the texas windstorm insurance association. amounts payable
or paid as a result of arrangements that are in substance reinsurance, including certain involuntary pools where insurers are required to assume premiums and losses from those pools, are accounted for
as reinsurance (e.g.,national workers' compensation reinsurance pool, north carolina beach plan). amounts related to assessments from arrangements that are not reinsurance are reported as a
component of "general and administrative expenses," such as the new york special disability fund. for additional information concerning assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other
mandatory pooling and reinsurance agreements including state-funding mechanisms, see "item1arisk factors."
insurance regulatory information system.the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) developed the insurance regulatory
information
system (iris) to help state regulators identify companies that may require special attention. financial examiners review annual statements and key financial ratios based on year-end data. these ratios
assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. each ratio has an established "usual range" of results. a ratio
result falling outside the usual range of iris ratios, however, is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. furthermore, in
some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. generally, an insurance company will become subject to regulatory
scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges of four or more of the ratios.
based
on preliminary 2014 iris ratios calculated by the company for its lead domestic insurance subsidiaries, the travelers indemnity company and st.paul fire and marine
insurance company had
table of contents
results
outside the normal range for one iris ratio due to the size of their investments in certain non-fixed maturity securities. travelers casualty and surety company had results outside the normal
range for one iris ratio due to the amount of dividends received from its subsidiaries.
in
2013, the travelers indemnity company and st.paul fire and marine insurance company had results outside the normal range for one iris ratio due to the size of their
investments in certain non-fixed maturity securities. travelers casualty and surety company had results outside the normal range for one iris ratio due to the amount of dividends received from its
subsidiaries.
management
does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2014 iris ratio results for the lead insurance subsidiaries or their insurance subsidiaries. in all instances in prior
years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required.
risk-based capital (rbc) requirements.the naic has an rbc requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies, which
determines minimum
capital requirements and is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these naic rbc requirements based on laws
that have been adopted by individual states. these requirements subject insurers having policyholders' surplus less than that required by the rbc calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action,
depending on the level of capital inadequacy. each of the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders' surplus at december31, 2014 significantly above the level at which any rbc
regulatory action would occur.
while
there is currently no group regulatory capital requirement in the united states, a comparison of an insurer's policyholders' surplus on a combined basis to the legal entity naic
rbc requirements on a combined basis can provide useful information regarding an insurance group's overall capital adequacy in the u.s. the amount of policyholders' surplus held by the company's u.s.
insurance subsidiaries at december31, 2014 determined on a combined basis significantly exceeded the level at which the subsidiaries would be subject to rbc regulatory action (company action
level) on a combined basis at that date.
the
formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital above the rbc requirement. therefore, it is inappropriate
and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies.
investment regulation.insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality
and
concentration of investments. in general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage
loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications. at december31, 2014, the company was in compliance with these laws and
regulations.
international regulation
trv's insurance subsidiaries based in canada and the canadian branch of one of the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries are regulated
by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions under provisions of the insurance companies act. these canadian subsidiaries and the canadian branch are also subject to provincial
insurance legislation which regulates pricing, underwriting, coverage and claim conduct, in varying degrees by province and by product line.
trv's
insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by two regulatory bodies, the prudential regulation authority (pra) and the financial conduct authority (fca). the
pra's primary objective is to promote the safety and soundness of insurers for the protection of policyholders, while the fca has three operational objectives: (i)to secure an appropriate
degree of protection for consumers, (ii)to protect and enhance the integrity of the uk financial system, and (iii)to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers. trv's
insurance operations in the republic of
table of contents
ireland
are conducted through the irish branch of travelers insurance company limited which is regulated by the insurance supervision departments of the central bank of ireland (as to conduct) and
also by the pra.
trv's
managing agency (travelers syndicate managementltd.) of its lloyd's syndicate (travelers syndicate 5000) is also regulated by the pra and the fca, which have delegated
certain regulatory responsibilities to the council of lloyd's. travelers syndicate 5000 is able to write business in over 75 jurisdictions throughout the world by virtue of lloyd's international
licenses. in each such jurisdiction, the policies written by travelers syndicate managementltd., as part of lloyd's, are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that jurisdiction.
travelers underwriting agency limited, which as an
insurance intermediary is regulated by the fca, produces insurance business for travelers syndicate5000.
a
trv subsidiary, travelers casualty and surety company, has a representative office in china. the representative office is regulated by the china insurance regulatory commission. a trv
subsidiary, tci global services,inc., has a liaison office in india. insurance business in india is regulated by the insurance regulatory and development authority. trv has a 49.5% investment
in jmalucelli, a joint venture holding company in brazil. jmalucelli's subsidiaries operate in the insurance and reinsurance business in brazil and are regulated by the superintendencia de seguros
privados.
regulators
in these jurisdictions require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance policies in force.
each of the company's foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at december31, 2014.
insurance holding company statutes
as a holding company, trv is not regulated as an insurance company. however, since trv owns capital stock in insurance subsidiaries, it
is subject to state insurance holding company statutes, as well as certain other laws, of each of its insurance subsidiaries' states of domicile. all holding company statutes, as well as other laws,
require disclosure and, in some instances, prior approval of material transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate. the holding company statutes and other laws also require, among other
things, prior approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer, some transactions between affiliates and the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions.
insurance regulations concerning change of control.many state insurance regulatory laws contain provisions that require advance
approval by state
agencies of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled, or, in some cases, having substantial business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled, in that state.
the
laws of many states also contain provisions requiring pre-notification to state agencies prior to any change in control of a non-domestic insurance company admitted to transact
business in that state. while these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, they do authorize issuance of cease and desist orders with respect
to the non-domestic insurer if it is determined that some conditions, such as undue market concentration, would result from the acquisition.
any
transactions that would constitute a change in control of any of trv's insurance subsidiaries would generally require prior approval by the insurance departments of the states in
which the insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or commercially domiciled. they may also require pre-acquisition notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions
and in which such insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business.
two
of trv's insurance subsidiaries and its operations at lloyd's are domiciled in the united kingdom. insurers in the united kingdom are subject to change of control restrictions in the
financial
table of contents
services
act of 2012, including approval of the pra and fca. some of trv's other insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in, or authorized to conduct insurance business in, canada. authorized insurers in
canada are subject to change of control restrictions in section407 of the insurance companies act, including approval of the office of the superintendent of financial institutions. jmalucelli
and its subsidiaries are subject to change of control and other share transfer restrictions and requirements in insurance laws and regulations in brazil, mainly in decree 73/1966 and cnsp resolution
no.166/2007, which may include the need for prior approval of the insurance regulator, superintendencia de seguros privados.
these
requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the ownership of common stock, including transactions that could be advantageous to trv's
shareholders.
regulatory developments
for a discussion of domestic and international regulatory developments, see "item1arisk factors" including
"changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on us and otherwise adversely impact our results" and "new regulations outside of the united states, including in the european union,
could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our growth."
enterprise risk management
as a large property and casualty insurance enterprise, the company is exposed to many risks. these risks are a function of the
environments within which the company operates. since certain risks can be correlated with other risks, an event or a series of events can impact multiple areas of the company simultaneously and have
a material effect on the company's results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. these exposures require an entity-wide view of risk and an understanding of the potential impact on all
aspects of the company's operations. it also requires the company to manage its risk-taking to be within its risk appetite in a prudent and balanced effort to create and preserve value for all of the
company's stakeholders. this approach to company-wide risk evaluation and management is commonly called enterprise risk management (erm). erm activities involve both the identification and assessment
of a broad range of risks and the execution of synchronized strategies to effectively manage such risks. effective erm also includes the determination of the company's risk capital needs, which takes
into account regulatory requirements and credit rating considerations, in addition to economic and other factors.
erm
at the company is an integral part of its business operations. all corporate leaders and the board of directors are engaged in erm. erm involves risk-based analytics, as well as
reporting and feedback throughout the enterprise in support of the company's long-term financial strategies and objectives.
the
company uses various methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to continually monitor and analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with
them. these analyses and methods are used in making underwriting and reinsurance decisions as part of managing the company's exposure to catastrophic events. in addition to catastrophe modeling and
analysis, the company also models and analyzes its exposure to other extreme events. the company also utilizes proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes to evaluate capital adequacy.
these analytical techniques are an integral component of the company's erm process and further support the company's long-term financial strategies and objectives.
in
addition to the day-to-day erm activities within the company's operations, key internal risk management functions include, among others, the management and operating committees
(comprised of the company's chief executive officer and the other most senior members of management), the enterprise and business risk committees of management, the credit committee, the chief
compliance officer, the corporate actuarial group, the corporate audit group, the accounting policy
table of contents
group
and the enterprise underwriting group. a senior executive serves as chief risk officer and oversees the erm process. the mission of this executive is to facilitate risk assessment and to
collaborate in implementing effective risk management strategies throughout the company. another strategic erm objective of this executive includes working across the company to enhance effective and
realistic risk modeling capabilities as part of the company's overall effort to understand and manage its portfolio of risks to be within its risk appetite. board oversight of erm is provided by the
risk committee of the board of directors, which reviews the strategies, processes and controls pertaining to the company's insurance operations and oversees the implementation, execution and
performance of the company's erm program.
the
company's erm efforts build upon the foundation of an effective internal control environment. erm expands the internal control objectives of effective and efficient operations,
reliable financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to fostering, leading and supporting an integrated, risk-based culture within the company that focuses on value
creation and preservation. however, the company can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that these objectives will be met. further, the design of any risk management or control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. as a result, the possibility of material financial loss remains in spite of the
company's significant erm efforts. an investor should carefully consider the risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report, including the discussions included in
"item1arisk factors," "item7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk," and "item8financial statements and
supplementary data."
other information
customer concentration
in the opinion of the company's management, no material part of the business of the company and its subsidiaries is dependent upon a
single customer or group of customers, the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the company, and no one customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for 10% or more
of the company's consolidated revenues.
employees
at december31, 2014, the company had approximately 30,200 employees. the company believes that its employee relations are
satisfactory. none of the company's employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

glossary of selected insurance terms
accident year
the annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.
adjusted unassigned surplus
unassigned surplus as of the most recent statutory annual report reduced by twenty-five percent of that year's unrealized
appreciation in value or revaluation of assets or unrealized profits on investments, as defined in that report.
admitted insurer
a company licensed to transact insurance business within a state.
table of contents
agent
a licensed individual who sells and services insurance policies, receiving a commission from the insurer for selling the business and a fee
for servicing it. an independent agent represents multiple insurance companies and searches the market for the best product for its client.
annuity
a contract that pays a periodic benefit over the remaining life of a person (the annuitant), the lives of two or more
persons or for a specified period of time.
assigned risk pools
reinsurance pools which cover risks for those unable to purchase insurance in the voluntary market. possible reasons for
this inability include the risk being too great or the profit being too small under the required insurance rate structure. the costs of the risks associated with these pools are charged back to insurance carriers in proportion to their direct
writings.
assumed reinsurance
insurance risks acquired from a ceding company.
average value analysis
a conventional actuarial method used to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an accident
year/product line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the unpaid losses.
the basic premise of the method is that average claim values are stable and predictable over time for a particular cohort
of claims. the method is utilized most often where ultimate claim counts are known or reliably estimable fairly early after the start of an accident year and average values are expected to be fairly predictable from one year to the next.
the method comes up with an estimate of ultimate claims counts by accident year cohort, and multiplies it by an estimate of
average claim value by accident year cohort, with multiple methods used to estimate these average claim values.
book value per share
total common shareholders' equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding.
bornhuetter-ferguson method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an accident year/product
line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the outstanding losses.
table of contents
the basic premise of the method is that the historical ratio of additional claim activity to earned premium for a given product line
component/age-to-age period is stable and predictable. it implicitly assumes that the actual activity to date for past periods for that cohort is not a credible predictor of future activity for that cohort, or at least is not credible enough to
override the "a priori" assumption as to future activity. it may be applied to either paid or case incurred claim data. it is used most often where the claim data is sparse and/or volatile and for relatively young cohorts with low volumes and/or data
credibility.
to illustrate, the method may assume that the ratio of additional paid losses from the 12 to 24month period for an
accident year is 10% of the original "a priori" expected losses for that accident year. the original "a priori" expected losses are typically based on the original loss ratio assumption for that accident year, with subsequent adjustment as facts
develop.
the ultimate losses equal actual activity to date plus the expected values for future periods.
broker
one who negotiates contracts of insurance or reinsurance on behalf of an insured party, receiving a commission from the
insurer or reinsurer for placement and other services rendered.
capacity
the percentage of statutory capital and surplus, or the dollar amount of exposure, that an insurer or reinsurer is willing
or able to place at risk. capacity may apply to a single risk, a program, a line of business or an entire book of business. capacity may be constrained by legal restrictions, corporate restrictions or indirect restrictions.
captive
a closely-held insurance company whose primary purpose is to provide insurance coverage to the company's owners or their
affiliates.
case-incurred development method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an accident year/product
line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the unpaid losses.
the approach is the same as that described in this glossary under the "paid loss development method," but based on the
growth in cumulative case-incurred losses (i.e.,the sum of claim-adjustor incurred estimates for claims in the cohort) rather than paid losses. the basic premise of the method is that cumulative case incurred losses for a given cohort of claims
will grow in a stable, predictable pattern from year-to-year, based on the age of the cohort.
case reserves
claim department estimates of anticipated future payments to be made on each specific individual reported
claim.
table of contents
casualty insurance
insurance which is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e.,not the insured, and the legal
liability imposed on the insured resulting therefrom. it includes, but is not limited to, employers' liability, workers' compensation, public liability, automobile liability, personal liability and aviation liability insurance. it excludes certain
types of losses that by law or custom are considered as being exclusively within the scope of other types of insurance, such as fire or marine.
catastrophe
a severe loss, resulting from a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms,
earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. catastrophes can also result from a terrorist attack (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), explosions,
infrastructure failures or as a consequence of political instability. each catastrophe has unique characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount. their effects are included in net and operating income and claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence. a catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.
catastrophe loss
loss and directly identified loss adjustment expenses from catastrophes.
catastrophe reinsurance
a form of excess-of-loss reinsurance which, subject to a specified limit, indemnifies the ceding company for the amount of
loss in excess of a specified retention with respect to an accumulation of losses and related reinsurance reinstatement premiums resulting from a catastrophic event. the actual reinsurance document is called a "catastrophe cover." these reinsurance
contracts are typically designed to cover property insurance losses but can be written to cover casualty insurance losses such as from workers' compensation policies.
cede; ceding company
when an insurer reinsures its liability with another insurer or a "cession," it "cedes" business and is referred to as the
"ceding company."
ceded reinsurance
insurance risks transferred to another company as reinsurance. see "reinsurance."
claim
request by an insured for indemnification by an insurance company for loss incurred from an insured peril.
claim adjustment expenses
see "loss adjustment expenses (lae)."
claims and claim adjustment expenses
see "loss" and "loss adjustment expenses (lae)."
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
see "loss reserves."
table of contents
cohort
a group of items or individuals that share a particular statistical or demographic characteristic. for example, all claims for a given
product in a given market for a given accident year would represent a cohort of claims.
combined ratio
for statutory accounting practices (sap), the combined ratio is the sum of the sap loss and lae ratio and the sap
underwriting expense ratio as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. the combined ratio as used in this report is the equivalent of, and is calculated in the same manner as, the sap combined ratio except that
the sap underwriting expense ratio is based on net written premium and the underwriting expense ratio as used in this report is based on net earned
premiums.
the combined ratio is an indicator of the company's underwriting discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its
business and overall underwriting profitability. a combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. a combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss.
other companies' method of computing a similarly titled measure may not be comparable to the company's method of computing
this ratio.
combined ratio excluding incremental impact of direct to consumer initiative
the combined ratio excluding incremental impact of direct to consumer initiative is the combined ratio adjusted to exclude
the direct, variable impact of the company's direct-to-consumer initiative in the personal insurance segment.
commercial multi-peril policies
refers to policies which cover both property and third-party liability exposures.
commutation agreement
an agreement between a reinsurer and a ceding company whereby the reinsurer pays an agreed-upon amount in exchange for a
complete discharge of all obligations, including future obligations, between the parties for reinsurance losses incurred.
debt-to-total capital ratio
the ratio of debt to total capitalization.
debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain (loss) on investments
the ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and
losses.
deductible
the amount of loss that an insured retains.
deferred acquisition costs (dac)
incremental direct costs of acquired and renewal insurance contracts, consisting of commissions (other than contingent
commissions) and premium-related taxes that are deferred and amortized to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses when reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap).
table of contents
deficiency
with regard to reserves for a given liability, a deficiency exists when it is estimated or determined that the reserves are insufficient to
pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. where the deficiency is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of deficiency (or even the finding of whether or not a deficiency exists) may change as new information becomes
available.
demand surge
significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials
and services, commonly as a result of a large catastrophe resulting in significant widespread property damage.
direct written premiums
the amounts charged by an insurer to insureds in exchange for coverages provided in accordance with the terms of an
insurance contract. the amounts exclude the impact of all reinsurance premiums, either assumed or ceded.
earned premiums or premiums earned
that portion of property casualty premiums written that applies to the expired portion of the policy term. earned premiums
are recognized as revenues under both statutory accounting practices (sap) and gaap.
excess and surplus lines insurance
insurance for risks not covered by standard insurance due to the unique nature of the risk. risks could be placed in excess
and surplus lines markets due to any number of characteristics, such as loss experience, unique or unusual exposures, or insufficient experience in business. excess and surplus lines are less regulated by the states, allowing greater flexibility to
design specific insurance coverage and negotiate pricing based on the risks to be secured.
excess liability
additional casualty coverage above a layer of insurance exposures.
excess-of-loss reinsurance
reinsurance that indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified portion of losses over a specified dollar amount or
"retention."
exposure
the measure of risk used in the pricing of an insurance product. the change in exposure is the amount of change in premium
on policies that renew attributable to the change in portfolio risk.
facultative reinsurance

negotiated.
fair access to insurance requirements (fair) plan
a residual market mechanism which provides property insurance to those unable to obtain such insurance through the regular
(voluntary) market. fair plans are set up on a state-by-state basis to cover only those risks in that state. for more information, see "residual market (involuntary business)."

fidelity and surety programs
fidelity insurance coverage protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee. surety is a
three-party agreement in which the insurer agrees to pay a third party or make complete an obligation in response to the default, acts or omissions of an insured.
gross written premiums
the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the
contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.
ground-up analysis
a method to estimate ultimate claim costs for a given cohort of claims such as an accident year/product line component. it
involves analyzing the exposure and claim activity at an individual insured level and then through the use of deterministic or stochastic scenarios and/or simulations, estimating the ultimate losses for those insureds. the total losses for the cohort
are then the sum of the losses for each individual insured.
in practice, the method is sometimes simplified by performing the individual insured analysis only for the larger insureds,
with the costs for the smaller insureds estimated via sampling approaches (extrapolated to the rest of the smaller insured population) or aggregate approaches (using assumptions consistent with the ground-up larger insured analysis).
guaranteed cost products
an insurance policy where the premiums charged will not be adjusted for actual loss experience during the covered
period.
guaranty fund
a state-regulated mechanism that is financed by assessing insurers doing business in those states. should insolvencies
occur, these funds are available to meet some or all of the insolvent insurer's obligations to policyholders.

paid development method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate losses for a given cohort of claims such as an accident year/product
line component. if the paid-to-date losses are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate losses, the result is an indication of the unpaid losses.
the basic premise of the method is that cumulative paid losses for a given cohort of claims will grow in a stable,
predictable pattern from year-to-year, based on the age of the cohort. these age-to-age growth factors are sometimes called "link ratios."
for example, if cumulative paid losses for a product line xyz for accident year 2004 were $100 as of december31, 2004
(12months after the start of that accident year), then grew to $120 as of december31, 2005 (24months after the start), the link ratio for that accident year from 12 to 24months would be 1.20. if the link ratio for other recent
accident years from 12 to 24months for that product line were also at or around 1.20, then the method would assume a similar result for the most recent accident year, i.e.,that it too would have its cumulative paid losses grow 120% from
the 12month to 24month valuation.
this is repeated for each age-to-age period into the future until the age-to-age link ratios for future periods are assumed
to be 1.0 (i.e.,the age at which cumulative losses are assumed to have stopped growing).
table of contents
a given accident year's cumulative losses are then projected to ultimate by multiplying current cumulative losses by successive age-to-age
link ratios up to that future age where growth is expected to end. for example, if growth is expected to end at 60months, then the ultimate indication for an accident year with cumulative losses at 12months equals those losses times a 12
to 24month link ratio, times a 24 to 36month link ratio, times a 36to48month link ratio, times a 48 to 60month link ratio.
advanced applications of the method include adjustments for changing conditions during the historical period and
anticipated changes in the future.

table of contents
renewal rate change
the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, excluding exposure changes. such statistics are subject to change based on
a number of factors, including changes in actuarial estimates.
reported claim development method
a conventional actuarial method to estimate ultimate claim counts for a given cohort of claims such as an accident
year/product line component. if the reported-to-date counts are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate counts, the result is an indication of the ibnr counts.
the approach is the same as that described in this glossary under the "paid loss development method", but based on the
growth in cumulative claim counts rather than paid losses. the basic premise of the method is that cumulative claim counts for a given cohort of claims will grow in a stable, predictable pattern from year-to-year, based on the age of the
cohort.
residual market (involuntary business)
insurance market which provides coverage for risks for those unable to purchase insurance in the voluntary market. possible
reasons for this inability include the risks being too great or the profit potential too small under the required insurance rate structure. residual markets are frequently created by state legislation either because of lack of available coverage such
as: property coverage in a windstorm prone area or protection of the accident victim as in the case of workers' compensation. the costs of the residual market are usually charged back to the direct insurance carriers in proportion to the carriers'
voluntary market shares for the type of coverage involved.

you
should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.
catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to
raise
capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes
can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions
and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts
(including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), explosions and infrastructure failures. the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe
exposures in the united states and canada, which include, but are not limited to: hurricanes from maine through texas; tornadoes throughout the central, mid-atlantic and southeastern regions of the
united states; earthquakes in california, the new madrid region and the pacific northwest region of north america; wildfires, particularly in western states and canada; and terrorism in major cities
in the united states. in addition to our operations in the united states and canada, our international operations subject us to catastrophe exposures in the united kingdom and the republic of ireland,
as well as to a variety of world-wide catastrophe exposures through our lloyd's operations, and in brazil through our joint venture investment.
the
incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that both the frequency and severity of natural and man-made catastrophic events could
increase. severe weather events over the last decade have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends, and potentially changing climate conditions could add to the frequency and severity
of natural disasters and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. for example, over the last decade, hurricane activity has impacted areas further inland than previously
experienced by us, thus expanding our potential for losses from hurricanes. additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the united states have been more volatile in
recent years. moreover, we could experience more than one highly severe catastrophic event in any given period.
all
of the catastrophe modeling tools that we use, or that we rely on from outside parties, to evaluate certain of our catastrophe exposures are based on assumptions and judgments that
are subject to error and mis-estimation and may produce estimates that are materially different than actual results. in addition, compared to models for hurricanes, models for earthquakes are less
reliable due to there being a more limited number of significant historical events to analyze, while models for tornadoes and hail storms are newer and may be even less reliable due to the highly
random geographic nature and size of these events. as a result, models for earthquakes and tornado and hail storms may have even greater difficulty predicting risks and estimating losses. further,
changes in climate conditions could cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively evaluate and manage catastrophe risk. see "we may be adversely
affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results" below as well as "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operationscatastrophe modeling" and "changing climate conditions."
the
extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. increases in the value
and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future. for example, the specific geographic
location impacted by tornadoes is inherently random and unpredictable and the specific location impacted by a tornado may or may not be highly populated and may or may not have a high concentration of
our insured exposures.
table of contents
states
have from time to time passed legislation, and regulators have taken action, that have the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk, such as
legislation prohibiting insurers from reducing exposures or withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas or mandating that insurers participate in residual markets. participation in residual market
mechanisms has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant losses or assessments to insurers, including us, and, in certain states, those losses or assessments may not be commensurate with
our direct catastrophe exposure in those states. if our competitors leave those states having residual market mechanisms, remaining insurers, including us, may be subject to significant increases in
losses or assessments following a catastrophe. in addition, following catastrophes, there are sometimes legislative and administrative initiatives and court decisions that seek to expand insurance
coverage for catastrophe claims beyond the original intent of the policies or seek to prevent the application of deductibles. also, our ability to adjust terms, including deductible levels, or to
increase pricing to the extent necessary to offset rising costs of catastrophes, particularly in the personal insurance segment, requires approval of regulatory authorities of certain states. our
ability or our willingness to manage our catastrophe exposure by raising prices, modifying underwriting terms or reducing exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public
policy, the evolving political environment and/or changes in the general economic climate. we also may choose to write business in catastrophe-prone areas that we might not otherwise write for
strategic purposes, such as improving our access to other underwriting opportunities.
there
are also factors that impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves related to hurricanes
can be affected by the inability to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the
information available to establish the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind;
evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage; business
interruption costs; and reinsurance collectability. in recent years, increased late reporting of weather-related losses by claimants, particularly losses from hail damage, has led to higher costs than
we previously expected. the timing of a catastrophe's occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to us in estimating claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves for that reporting period. the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted in subsequent periods as actual claims emerge and additional information becomes available.
exposure
to catastrophe losses or actual losses resulting from a catastrophe could adversely affect our financial strength and claims-paying ratings and could impair our ability to raise
capital on acceptable terms or at all. also, as a result of our exposure to catastrophe losses or actual losses following a catastrophe, rating agencies may further increase capital requirements,
which may require us to raise capital to maintain our ratings. a ratings downgrade could hurt our ability to compete effectively or attract new business. in addition, catastrophic events could cause
us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely impact the cost and availability of reinsurance. such events can also impact the credit of our reinsurers. for a discussion of our
catastrophe reinsurance coverage, see
"item1businessreinsurancecatastrophe reinsurance." catastrophic events could also adversely impact the credit of the issuers of securities, such as
states or municipalities, in whom we have invested.
in
addition, coverage in our reinsurance program for terrorism is limited. although the terrorism risk insurance program provides benefits in the event of certain acts of terrorism,
those benefits are subject to a deductible and other limitations. the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized, with some adjustments to its provisions, in january 2015 for six years
through december31, 2020. under current provisions of this program, once our losses exceed 20% of our
table of contents
commercial
property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for 85% of our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism which
exceed this deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100billion. our estimated deductible under the program is $2.38billion for 2015. over the six-year life of the
reauthorized program, the federal government reimbursement percentage will fall from 85% to 80%. in addition, because the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to
how it will be applied to specific circumstances. it is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect our business by increasing our
exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering our business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure.
because
of the risks set forth above, catastrophes such as those caused by various natural events or man-made events such as a terrorist attack, including "unconventional" acts of
terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. further, we may not have
sufficient resources to respond to claims arising from a high frequency of high severity natural catastrophes and/or of man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means. in addition, while we
seek to manage our exposure to man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means, we may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or more man-made catastrophic
events involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological means.
during or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected.worldwide
financial markets have, from time to time, experienced significant disruption. for example, during the financial crisis that started approximately seven years ago, the united states and many other
economies experienced a prolonged economic downturn, resulting in heightened credit risk, reduced valuation of certain investments and decreased economic activity. financial markets may again
experience significant and prolonged disruption, including as a result of unanticipated events. in recent years, the federal government, particularly the federal reserve, has taken extraordinary steps
to stabilize financial markets, encourage economic growth and
keep interest rates low. during this time, the united states has experienced a slow rate of economic growth. even if economic growth continues in the united states, or other regions in which we do
business, it may be at a slow or slower rate for an extended period of time. while inflation has recently been limited and that trend may continue, it is possible that the steps taken by the federal
government to stabilize financial markets and improve economic conditions could lead to an inflationary environment. further, such steps may be ineffective and, in the case of the federal reserve,
actual or anticipated efforts to continue to unwind some of such steps could disrupt financial markets and/or could adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio or general economic
conditions.
financial
market disruption or economic downturns could be exacerbated by actual or potential economic and geopolitical instability in many regions of the world. this can impact our
business even if we do not conduct business in the region subject to the instability. for example, due to globalization, instability in one region can spread to other regions where we do business. in
europe, uncertainty in recent years has included the increased potential for default by one or more european sovereign debt issuers, the potential partial or complete dissolution of the eurozone and
its common currency and the negative impact of such potential events on global financial institutions and capital markets generally. actions or inactions of european governments may impact these
actual or perceived risks. in the united states, future actions or inactions of the united states government can also impact economic conditions. for example, issues related to the u.s. federal budget
and taxes, implementation of the affordable care act and the regulatory environment have added to the uncertainty regarding economic conditions generally.
if
economic conditions deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or
liquidity. several of
table of contents
the
risk factors discussed below identify risks that result from, or are exacerbated by, an economic slowdown or financial disruption. these include risks discussed below related to our investment
portfolio, reinsurance arrangements, other credit exposures, our estimates of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, emerging claim and coverage issues, the competitive environment, regulatory
developments and the impact of rating agency actions. you should also refer to "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,"
particularly the "outlook" section.
many
of these risks could materialize, and our financial results could be negatively impacted, even after the end of an economic downturn or financial disruption. during or following an
economic downturn, lower levels of economic activity could reduce (and historically have reduced) exposure changes at renewal. they also could adversely impact (and historically have adversely
impacted) audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written, particularly in our business units within business and international insurance, which
could adversely impact our written premiums. an inflationary environment (which may follow government efforts to stabilize the
economy) may also, as we discuss below, adversely impact our loss costs and could adversely impact the valuation of our investment portfolio. finally, as a result of financial market disruption, we
may, as discussed below, face increased regulation.
if actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, our
financial results could be materially and adversely affected.claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but
instead represent management estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting
date.
the
process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables can be affected by both
internal and external events, such as: changes in claims handling procedures; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures on medical costs and auto and home repair costs;
economic conditions including general inflation; legal trends and legislative changes; and varying judgments and viewpoints of the individuals involved in the estimation process, among others. the
impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimation difficulties also differ
significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting
lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer).
as
discussed above, it is possible that steps taken by the federal government to stabilize the economy could lead to higher inflation than we had anticipated, which could in turn lead to
an increase in our loss costs. the impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines of business that are considered "long tail," such as general liability, as they require a
relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. in addition, a significant portion of claims costs, including those in "long tail" lines of business, consists
of medical costs. healthcare reform legislation and its implementation may significantly impact the availability, cost and allocation of payments for medical services, and it is possible that, as a
result, inflationary pressures in medical costs may increase or claim frequency and/or severity may otherwise be adversely impacted. the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may
also be more difficult during times of adverse or uncertain economic conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of
exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or increased frequency of small claims or delays in the reporting of claims.
table of contents
we
continually refine our claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and
settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. business judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to
multiple sets of data and analyses. different experts may choose different assumptions when faced with material uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas
of focus. hence, such experts may at times produce estimates materially different from each other. this risk may be exacerbated in the context of an acquisition. experts providing input to the various
estimates and underlying assumptions include actuaries, underwriters, claim personnel and lawyers, as well as other members of management. therefore, management may have to consider varying individual
viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
we
attempt to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established or reviewed. due to the inherent uncertainty
underlying claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, the final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses will likely be higher or lower than the
related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than is currently reserved.
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities resulting from one insured event, or an accumulation of insured events, may exceed the current related reserves. in
addition, our estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could

our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses.investment returns are an important part
of our
overall profitability. fixed maturity and short-term investments comprised approximately 93% of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december31, 2014. changes in interest rates
caused by inflation or other factors (inclusive of credit spreads) affect the carrying value of our fixed maturity investments and returns on our fixed maturity and short-term investments. a decline
in interest rates reduces the returns available on short-term investments and new fixed maturity investments (including those purchased to re-invest maturities from the existing portfolio), thereby
negatively impacting our net investment income, while rising interest rates reduce the market value of existing fixed maturity investments, thereby negatively impacting our book value. during 2014,
the net unrealized gain in our fixed income portfolio increased from $1.76billion to $2.67billion as interest rates decreased. it is possible that future increases in interest rates
(inclusive of credit spreads) could result in a decline in that unrealized gain position or even result in an unrealized loss, thereby adversely impacting our book value. interest rates in recent
years have been and remain at very low levels relative to historical experience, and it is possible that rates
may remain at low levels for a prolonged period. the value of our fixed maturity and short-term investments is also subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to a
deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities held in our portfolio, or due to a deterioration in the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an issuer's
payments of such investments. such defaults and impairments could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. during an economic downturn, fixed maturity and short-term
investments could be subject to a higher risk of default. rapid changes in commodity prices, such as a significant decline in oil and gas prices, could also subject certain of our investments to a
higher risk of default.
table of contents
our
fixed maturity investment portfolio is invested, in substantial part, in obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal
bond portfolio). notwithstanding the relatively low historical rates of default on many of these obligations and notwithstanding that we typically seek to invest in high-credit-quality securities
(including those with structural protections such as being secured by dedicated or pledged sources of revenue), our municipal bond portfolio could be subject to default or impairment. in
particular:
the prolonged economic downturn that began in 2008, and the limited economic recovery that has followed, has resulted in many states
and local governments operating under deficits or projected deficits. the severity and duration of these deficits could have an adverse impact on the collectability and valuation of our municipal bond
portfolio. these deficits may be exacerbated by the impact of unfunded pension plan obligations and other postretirement obligations or by declining municipal tax bases and revenues in times of
financial stress.
some issuers may be unwilling to increase tax rates, or to reduce spending, to fund interest or principal payments on their municipal
bonds, or may be unable to access the municipal bond market to fund such payments. the risk of widespread defaults may increase if some issuers voluntarily choose to default, instead of implementing
difficult fiscal measures, and the actual or perceived consequences (such as reduced access to capital markets) are less severe than expected.
the risk of widespread defaults may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit states, municipalities and political
subdivisions to file for bankruptcy protection where they were not permitted before. in addition, the collectability and valuation of municipal bonds may be adversely affected if there are judicial
interpretations in a bankruptcy or other proceeding that lessen the value of structural protections. for example, debtors may challenge the effectiveness of structural protections thought to be
provided by municipal securities backed by a dedicated source of revenue. the collectability and valuation may also be adversely affected if there are judicial interpretations in a bankruptcy or other
proceeding that question the payment priority of municipal bonds.
a
substantial portion of our fixed maturity portfolio will mature within the next few years. approximately 40% of the fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three
years (this includes the early redemption of bonds, assuming interest rates (including credit spreads) do not rise significantly by applicable call dates). for a schedule of the contractual maturities
of our fixed maturity portfolio by year for the next several years, see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationsinvestment portfolio." of that maturing portfolio, a substantial amount includes municipal bonds that have been pre-refunded with u.s. treasury securities. as a result, even if
our investment strategy does not significantly change over the next few years, the overall yield on and composition of our portfolio could be meaningfully impacted by the types of investments
available for reinvestment with the proceeds of matured bonds. for example, if yields remain low when we reinvest such proceeds, our future net investment income would be adversely affected. in
addition, depending on the specific bonds available for purchase at the time of re-investment, the mix of specific issuers in our fixed-income and municipal bond portfolio will change.
our
portfolio has benefited from tax exemptions and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign
tax credits). changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio. see "changes in u.s. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could
adversely impact us" below.
our
investment portfolio includes: residential mortgage-backed securities; collateralized mortgage obligations; pass-through securities and asset-backed securities collateralized by
sub-prime mortgages; commercial mortgage-backed securities; and wholly-owned real estate and real estate partnerships, all
table of contents
of
which could be adversely impacted by declines in real estate valuations and/or financial market disruption.
we
also invest a portion of our assets in equity securities, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. from time to time, we may also invest in other
types of non-fixed maturity investments, including investments with exposure to commodity price risk, such as in the energy sector. all of these asset classes are subject to greater volatility in
their investment returns than fixed maturity investments. general economic conditions, changes in applicable tax laws and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our
non-fixed maturity investments and the realization of net investment income, and/or result in realized investment losses. as a result of these factors, we may realize reduced returns on these
investments, incur losses on sales of these investments and be required to write down the value of these investments, which could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment
losses. from time to time, the company enters into short positions in u.s. treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio, which can result in realized investment
losses.
our
investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are
illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e.,the carrying amount) of the portion of the investment portfolio that is carried at fair value as reflected in our
financial statements is not reflective of prices at which actual transactions could occur.
given
that economic and market conditions have been and could be highly uncertain, we may, depending on circumstances in the future, make changes to the mix of investments in our
investment portfolio. these changes may impact the duration, volatility and risk of our investment portfolio.
because
of the risks set forth above, the value of our investment portfolio could decrease, we could experience reduced net investment income and we could experience realized and/or
unrealized investment losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation.
with
regard to asbestos claims, we have received and continue to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from policyholders (including others seeking coverage under a policy).
factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the continued focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not traditionally
primary targets of asbestos litigation. the focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years.
the bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. currently, in many
jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown
any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. this trend of
prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, has contributed to the claims and
claim adjustment expense payments we experienced.
we
also continue to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or a
portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. in these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated
as a separate occurrence under the policy. it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues.
table of contents
to
the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor and our other defenses are not successful, our coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and
bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. although we have seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with
these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims.
further,
in addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including us, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to
the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. it is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers,
including us, could be made in the future. it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on
novel legal theories of liability.
with
regard to environmental claims, we have received and continue to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged
disposition of toxic substances. mostly, these claims arise under various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. for instance, the comprehensive environmental
response, compensation and liability act (cercla), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and
threatened releases of hazardous substances. this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action.
liability under cercla and similar state laws may be imposed on certain parties even if they did not cause the release or threatened release of hazardous substances and may be joint and several with
other responsible parties.
the
company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. the company believes that some court decisions
have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction.
uncertainties
surrounding the final resolution of these asbestos and environmental claims continue, and it is difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims and related
litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without
limitation:
the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation;
any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants;
a further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated;
the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical
advances and lifestyle improvements;
the role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued;
the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a
manner inconsistent with our previous assessment of these claims;
the number and outcome of direct actions against us;
future developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims;
table of contents
the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or
through the insolvency of other participating insurers; and
uncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants.
it
is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. this
environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or
judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near
completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations
often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective.
while
the ongoing evaluation of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded
theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in
liability in future periods that differs from
current reserves by an amount that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. see the "asbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation" sections of
"item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." also see "item3legal proceedings."
we are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or
substances.in addition to asbestos and environmental claims, we face exposure to other types of mass tort claims, including claims related to exposure to
potentially harmful products or substances, including lead paint, silica and welding rod fumes. establishing claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for mass tort claims is subject to
uncertainties because of many factors, including expanded theories of liability, disputes concerning medical causation with respect to certain diseases, geographical concentration of the lawsuits
asserting the claims and the potential for a large rise in the total number of claims without underlying epidemiological developments suggesting an increase in disease rates. moreover, evolving
judicial interpretations regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liabilities, as well as the application of
insurance coverage to these claims, make it difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims.
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. in addition, our estimate of claims and claim
adjustment expenses may change, and such change could be material. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially
and adversely affect our results of operations.
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and
other
environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge. these issues may adversely affect our business, including by extending coverage beyond our
underwriting intent, by increasing the number, size or types of claims or by mandating changes to our underwriting practices. examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, but are not
limited to:
judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new or expanded theories of liability;
plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including us, in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling
and other practices;
table of contents
claims relating to construction defects, which often present complex coverage and damage valuation questions;
claims under directors'& officers' insurance policies relating to losses from involvement in financial market activities, such
as mortgage or financial product origination, distribution, structuring or servicing and foreclosure procedures; failed financial institutions; fraud; possible accounting irregularities; and corporate
governance issues;
claims related to data and network security breaches, information system failures or cyber attacks;
the assertion of "public nuisance" or similar theories of liability, pursuant to which plaintiffs seek to recover monies spent to
administer public health care programs, abate hazards to public health and safety and/or recover damages purportedly attributable to a "public nuisance";
claims related to liability or workers' compensation arising out of the spread of infectious disease or pandemic;
claims relating to molestation by an employee or a volunteer of an insured;
claims that link health issues to particular causes (for example, cumulative traumatic head injury from sports or other causes),
resulting in liability or workers' compensation claims;
claims alleging that one or more of our underwriting criteria have a disparate impact on persons belonging to a protected class in
violation of the law, including the fair housing act;
claims arising out of techniques to expand access to oil and gas resources, such as hydraulic fracturing;
claims arising out of the use of personal cars, homes or other property in commercial transactions, such as ride or home sharing;
claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies or business processes; and
claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions, including higher frequency and severity of weather-related events.
in
some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies. as a result, the full extent of liability under our
insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued.
in
addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to deem by statute the existence of a covered occurrence, to
extend the statutes
of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business.
the
effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of
operations.
the intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.the
property and
casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, and we believe that it will remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. we compete with both domestic and foreign insurers which may offer
products at prices and on terms that are not consistent with our economic standards in an effort to maintain or increase their business. the competitive environment in which we operate could also be
impacted by current general economic conditions, which could reduce the volume of business available to us as well as to our competitors. in recent years, pension and hedge funds and other entities
with substantial available capital have increasingly
table of contents
sought
to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. well-capitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries, or existing
competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital, may conduct business in ways that adversely impact our business volumes and profitability. further, an expanded supply of reinsurance capital
may lower costs for insurers that rely significantly on reinsurance and, as a consequence, those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively. in addition, the competitive
environment could be impacted by changes in customer preferences, including customer demand for direct distribution channels, not only in personal lines (where we currently and may increasingly
compete against direct writers), but also in commercial lines (where direct writers may become a more significant source of competition in the future, particularly in the small commercial market).
in
personal insurance, the use of comparative rating technologies has impacted, and may continue to impact, our business as well as the industry as a whole. a substantial amount of the
company's personal insurance new business is written after an agent compares quotes using comparative rating technologies, a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple companies. because
the use of this technology, whether by agents or directly by customers, facilitates the process of generating multiple quotes, the technology has increased price comparison on new business and,
increasingly, on renewal business. it also has resulted in an increase in the level of quote activity and a lower percentage of quotes that result in new business from customers, and these trends may
continue or accelerate. if we are not able to operate with a competitive cost structure or accurately estimate and price for claims and claim adjustment expenses, our underwriting margins could be
adversely affected over time. additionally, similar technology is starting to be used to access comparative rates for small commercial business and that trend may continue or accelerate. agents,
brokers, significant technology
companies or other third parties may also create alternate distribution channels for personal or commercial business, such as insurance exchanges, that may adversely impact product differentiation and
pricing.
other
technological changes may present competitive risks. for example, innovations, such as telematics and other usage-based methods of determining premiums, can impact product design
and pricing and may become an increasingly important competitive factor. other potential technological changes, such as driverless cars or technologies that facilitate ride or home sharing, could
disrupt the demand for our products from current customers, create coverage issues or impact the frequency or severity of losses, and we may not be able to respond effectively. in addition, our
competitive position could be impacted by our ability to deploy, in a cost effective manner, technology that collects and analyzes a wide variety of data points (so-called "big data" analysis) to make
underwriting or other decisions. see also "our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements
in technology" below.
in
recent years, we have undertaken various actions to improve our underwriting margins on many of our insurance products, and competitive dynamics may impact the success of these
efforts. these efforts include seeking improved rates, as well as improved terms and conditions, and also include other initiatives, such as reducing operating expenses and acquisition costs. these
efforts may not continue to be successful and/or may result in lower retention and new business levels and therefore lower business volumes. in addition, if our underwriting is not effective, further
efforts to increase rates could also lead to "adverse selection", whereby accounts retained have higher losses, and are less profitable, than accounts lost. for more detail, see
"item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoutlook."
in
particular, in our agency automobile line of business, we have undertaken various actions to improve our underwriting margins, which have been, and may continue to be, negatively
impacted by various factors. see "item1businesspersonal insurancecompetition" above for a description of some of these actions, including the offer of a
new, more competitively-priced product. these factors include (i)changes in customer preferences and demand for direct distribution channels, (ii)utilization of comparative rating
technologies by agents and/or technology companies and (iii)other technological changes, as described above. if our strategies to increase profitability in the agency automobile line of
business are not effective, we may need to explore other actions or initiatives to improve our competitive position and profitability in this line of business.
table of contents
overall, our competitive position in our various businesses is based on many factors, including but not limited to
our:
ability to profitably price our business, retain existing customers and obtain new business;
premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered (including the ability to design customized programs);
agent, broker and client relationships;
ability to keep pace relative to our competitors with changes in technology and information systems;
speed of claims payment;
ability to provide our products and services in a cost effective manner;
perceived overall financial strength and corresponding ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;
reputation, experience and qualifications of employees;
geographic scope of business; and
local presence.
we
may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. if competition limits our ability to retain existing business or write new business at
adequate rates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. see "competition" sections of the discussion on business segments in "item1business."
we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at
all.although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. as a result,
ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. accordingly, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.
in
the past, certain reinsurers have ceased writing business and entered into runoff. some of our reinsurance claims may be disputed by the reinsurers, and we may ultimately receive
partial or no payment. this is a particular risk in the case of claims that relate to insurance policies written many years ago, including those relating to asbestos and environmental claims. in
addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the european union and the united kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less
creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority.
included
in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to certain structured settlements. structured settlements are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle
certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where we did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured settlement
is included in reinsurance recoverables and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as we retain the contingent liability to the claimant.
if it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, we would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not
covered by state guaranty associations. in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, we would be required to make such payments.
table of contents
many
life insurance companies were negatively impacted by the financial markets disruption and the economic downturn beginning in 2008. a number of these companies, including certain of
those with which we conduct business or to which we otherwise have credit exposure, were downgraded by various rating agencies during this time period. for a discussion of our top reinsurance groups
by reinsurance recoverable and the top five groups by amount of structured settlements provided, see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operationsreinsurance recoverables."
the
availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity. the availability of reinsurance capacity can be
impacted by general economic conditions and conditions in the reinsurance market, such as the occurrence of significant reinsured events. the availability and cost of reinsurance could affect our
business volume and profitability.
because
of the risks set forth above, we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at
commercially reasonable rates or at all, and/or life insurance companies may fail to make required annuity payments, and thus our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we are exposed to credit risk in certain of our business and investment operations including reinsurance or structured settlements.in
addition to
exposure to credit risk related to our investment portfolio and reinsurance recoverables (discussed above), we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business operations, including
credit risk relating to policyholders, independent agents and brokers.
we
are exposed to credit risk in our surety insurance operations, where we guarantee to a third party that our customer will satisfy certain performance obligations (e.g., a construction
contract) or certain financial obligations, including exposure to large customers who may have obligations to multiple third parties. if our customer defaults, we may suffer losses and not be
reimbursed by that customer. in addition, it is customary practice in the surety business for multiple insurers to participate as co-sureties on large surety bonds. under these arrangements, the
co-surety obligations are typically joint and several, in which case we are also exposed to credit risk with respect to our co-sureties.
in
addition, a portion of our business is written with large deductible insurance policies. under casualty insurance contracts with deductible features, we are obligated to pay the
claimant the full amount of the claim. we are subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount, and, as a result, we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder. moreover,
certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers' compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the
policyholder during the policy period). retrospectively rated policies expose us to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium.
our
efforts to mitigate the credit risk that we have to our insureds may not be successful. to reduce such credit risk, we require certain insureds to post collateral for some or all of
these obligations, often in the form of pledged securities such as money market funds or letters of credit provided by banks, surety bonds or cash. in cases where we receive pledged securities and the
insureds are unable to honor their obligations, we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged and/or the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed during an insured's
bankruptcy. in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks and the insureds are unable to honor their obligations, we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of
credit.
in
accordance with industry practice, when policyholders purchase insurance policies from us through independent agents and brokers, the premiums relating to those policies are often
paid to the agents and brokers for payment to us. in most jurisdictions, the premiums will be deemed to have been
table of contents
paid
to us whether or not they are actually received by us. consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with amounts due from independent agents and brokers.
to
a large degree, the credit risk we face is a function of the economy; accordingly, we face a greater risk in an economic downturn. while we attempt to manage the risks discussed above
through underwriting and investment guidelines, collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful. for example, collateral obtained may subsequently have little
or no value. as a result, our exposure to the above credit risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
within the united states, our businesses are heavily regulated by the states in which we conduct business, including licensing and supervision, and changes in regulation may reduce
our
profitability and limit our growth.these regulatory systems are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of
insurers, their shareholders and other investors. for example, to protect policyholders whose insurance company becomes financially insolvent, guaranty funds have been established in all 50 states to
pay the covered claims of policyholders in the event of an insolvency of an insurer, subject to applicable state limits. the funding of guaranty funds is provided through assessments levied against
remaining insurers in the marketplace. as a result, the insolvency of one or more insurance companies could result in additional assessments levied against us.
these
regulatory systems also address authorization for lines of business, statutory capital and surplus requirements, limitations on the types and amounts of certain investments,
underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurer's business.
in
recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. further, the naic and state insurance regulators continually re-examine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing
on modifications to
holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations.
included
in these changes is an amendment to insurance holding company regulations that require insurers who are part of a holding company system to file an enterprise risk report to
provide the lead insurance regulator with a summary of the company's enterprise risk management (erm) framework including the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose
risk to the insurance entities within the holding company system. beginning in 2015, insurers having premium volume above certain thresholds, including the company, will also be required to perform at
least annually a self-assessment of their current and future risks, including their likely future solvency position (known as an own risk and solvency assessment or orsa) and file a confidential
report with the insurer's lead insurance regulator. the orsa concept has two primary goals, which are to foster an effective level of erm at all insurers within the holding company system, and to
provide a group wide perspective on risk and capital as a supplement to the legal entity view. orsa is now included in the international association of insurance supervisors (iais) standards and is in
various stages of implementation in the united states, europe, canada, and other jurisdictions. it is possible that, as a result of orsa or other reasons, our states of domicile or other regulatory
bodies will require changes in our erm process or take other regulatory actions that could limit our ability to write additional business or reduce our capital management flexibility. see "enterprise
risk management" herein for further discussion of the company's erm.
the
naic and state insurance regulators, as well as the federal reserve and federal insurance office, are currently working with the iais to develop a global common framework (comframe)
for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups (iaigs). if adopted, comframe would require the designation of a group-wide supervisor (regulator) for each iaig and would impose a
table of contents
group
capital requirement that would be applied to an iaig in addition to the current legal entity capital requirements imposed by state insurance regulators. in response to comframe, the naic is
developing a model law that would allow state insurance regulators in the u.s. to be designated as group-wide supervisors for u.s. based iaigs. additionally, the naic is developing a group capital
standard that would be applied to u.s. based insurance groups. these regulatory developments could increase the amount of capital that the company is required to have and could result in the company
being subject to increased regulatory requirements.
in
a time of financial uncertainty or a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, regulators may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations. for example, insurance
regulators may choose to restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies or reject rate increases due to the economic environment. the state insurance
regulators may also increase the statutory capital and surplus requirements for our insurance subsidiaries. in addition, state
tax laws that specifically impact the insurance industry, such as premium taxes or other taxes, may be enacted or changed by states to raise revenues.
state
laws or regulations that are adopted or amended may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus
could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.
changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on us and otherwise adversely impact our results.while the u.s. federal
government
has not historically regulated the insurance business, in 2010, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act) established a federal insurance office (the fio)
within the u.s. department of the treasury. the fio has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather data and information regarding the insurance industry and insurers. in december 2013,
the fio released a report recommending ways to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states. while the report did not recommend full federal regulation of insurance,
it did suggest an expanded federal role in some circumstances. in addition, the report suggested that congress should consider direct federal involvement to fill regulatory gaps identified in the
report, should those gaps persist, for example, by considering either establishing a federal coordinating body or a direct regulator of select aspects of the industry, such as large complex
institutions or institutions that seek a federal charter, if a law is passed to allow a federal charter. it is not clear as to the extent, if any, the report will lead to regulatory changes or how any
such changes would impact the company.
the
dodd-frank act also gives the federal reserve supervisory authority over a number of nonbank financial services holding companies, including insurance companies, if they are
designated by a two-thirds vote of a financial stability oversight council (the fsoc) as "systemically important financial institutions" (sifi). the fsoc, chaired by the secretary of the treasury, is
a group of federal financial regulators, a state insurance regulator and an independent insurance expert. the fsoc considers companies for designation as a sifi annually and finalized its first set of
sifi designations in 2013. the company, based upon the fsoc's rules and interpretive guidance, has not been designated as a sifi. nonetheless, it is possible that the council may change its rules or
interpretations in the future and conclude that we are a sifi. if we were designated as a sifi, the federal reserve's supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial
regulation and could impact requirements regarding our capital, liquidity and leverage as well as our business and investment conduct. as a result of the foregoing, the dodd-frank act, or other
additional federal regulation that is adopted in the future, could impose significant burdens on us, including impacting the ways in which we conduct our business, increasing compliance costs and
duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive disadvantage, particularly relative to other insurers that may not be subject to the same level of regulation. changes in the u.s.
regulatory framework could impact the overall competitive environment by imposing additional burdens on us and allowing other competitors not subject to these same burdens to enter or expand their
insurance businesses.
table of contents
even
if we are not subject to additional regulation by the federal government, significant financial sector regulatory reform, including the dodd-frank act, could have a significant
impact on us. for example, regulatory reform could have an unexpected impact on our rights as a creditor or on our competitive position. in particular, the dodd-frank act authorizes assessments to pay
for the resolution of systemically important financial institutions that have become insolvent. we (as a financial company with more than $50billion in assets) could be assessed, and, although
any such assessment is required to be risk weighted (i.e., riskier firms pay more), such costs could be material to us and are not currently estimable.
other
potential changes in u.s. federal legislation, regulation and/or administrative policies, including the potential repeal of the mccarran-ferguson act (which exempts insurance from
most federal regulation) and potential changes in federal taxation, could also significantly harm the insurance industry, including us.
a downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase
our
borrowing costs.claims-paying and financial strength ratings are important to an insurer's competitive position. rating agencies periodically review insurers'
ratings and change their ratings criteria; therefore, our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. a downgrade in one or more of our ratings could negatively impact our business volumes
because demand for certain of our products may be reduced, particularly because many customers may require that we maintain minimum ratings to enter into or renew business with us. additionally, we
may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs. if significant losses, including, but not limited to, those resulting from one or more major
catastrophes, or significant reserve additions or significant investment losses were to cause our capital position to deteriorate significantly, or if one or more rating agencies substantially
increase their capital requirements, we may need to raise equity capital in the future (which we may not be able to do at a reasonable cost or at all, especially at a time of financial market
disruption) in order to maintain our ratings or limit the extent of a downgrade. a continued trend of more frequent and severe weather-related catastrophes or a prolonged financial market disruption
or economic downturn may lead rating agencies to substantially increase their capital requirements. see also "during or following a period of financial market disruption or economic downturn, our
business could be materially and adversely affected." for further discussion about our ratings, see, "item1businessratings."
the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations, pay future shareholder
dividends
or make
future share repurchases.our holding company relies on dividends from our u.s. insurance subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and
principal on outstanding debt, to pay dividends to shareholders, to make contributions to our qualified domestic pension plan, to pay other corporate expenses and to make share repurchases. the
ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in the future will depend on their statutory capital and surplus, earnings and regulatory restrictions.
we
are subject to state insurance regulation as an insurance holding company system. our u.s. insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum
amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. in a time of prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, insurance regulators may
choose to further restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies. the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company is also
restricted by regulations that set standards of solvency that must be met and maintained.
table of contents
the
inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in an amount sufficient to meet our debt service obligations and other cash requirements could harm
our ability to meet our obligations, to pay future shareholder dividends and to make share repurchases.
disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us.we market our insurance products
primarily
through independent agents and brokers. an important part of our business is written through less than a dozen such intermediaries. further, there has been a trend of increased consolidation by agents
and brokers, which could impact our relationships with, and fees paid to, some agents and brokers, and/or otherwise negatively impact the pricing or distribution of our products. agents and brokers
may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets increasingly provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk. see also "the intense competition
that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability." in all of the foregoing situations, loss of all or a substantial portion of the business
provided through such agents and brokers could materially and adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations.
we
may also seek to develop new products or distribution channels, including our establishment of a direct-to-consumer platform in the personal insurance segment and our new quantum 2.0
auto product. in addition, agents and brokers may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business, such as insurance exchanges, that may adversely impact product differentiation and
pricing. access to greater levels of data and increased utilization of technology by agents and brokers may also impact our relationship with them and our competitive position. our efforts or their
efforts with
respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with
independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume of business generated from these sources.
we
rely on internet applications for the marketing and sale of certain of our products, and we may increasingly rely on internet applications and toll-free numbers for distribution. in
some instances, our agents and brokers are required to access separate business platforms to execute the sale of our personal insurance or commercial insurance products. should internet disruptions
occur, or frustration with our business platforms or distribution initiatives develop among our independent agents and brokers, any resulting loss of business could materially and adversely affect our
future business volume and results of operations. see "if we experience difficulties with technology, data security and/or outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be
negatively impacted" below.
customers
in the past have brought claims against us for the actions of our agents. even with proper controls in place, actual or alleged errors or inaccuracies by our agents could
result in our involvement in disputes, litigation or regulatory actions related to actions taken or not taken by our agents.
our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets may not be successful and may create enhanced risks.a number of our
recent and
planned business initiatives involve developing new products or expanding existing products in targeted markets. this includes the following efforts, from time to time, to protect or grow market
share:
we may develop products that insure risks we have not previously insured, contain new coverage or coverage terms or contain different
commission terms. for example, in response to the competitive environment in personal auto insurance, we have rolled out a new product called quantum auto 2.0 that is intended to be more
competitively-priced. see "item1businesspersonal insurancecompetition."
table of contents
we may refine our underwriting processes. for example, in certain of our businesses in recent years, we have substantially increased
the volume of business that flows through our automated underwriting and pricing systems.
we may seek to expand distribution channels, such as our establishment of a direct-to-consumer platform in personal insurance.
we may focus on geographic markets within or outside of the united states where we have had relatively little or no market share.
we
may not be successful in introducing new products or expanding in targeted markets and, even if we are successful, these efforts may create enhanced risks. among other
risks:
demand for new products or in new markets may not meet our expectations.
to the extent we are able to market new products or expand in new markets, our risk exposures may change, and the data and models we
use to manage such exposures may not be as sophisticated or effective as those we use in existing markets or with existing products. this, in turn, could lead to losses in excess of our expectations.
models underlying automated underwriting and pricing decisions may not be effective.
efforts to develop new products or markets have the potential to create or increase distribution channel conflict, such as described
above under "disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us."
in connection with the conversion of existing policyholders to a new product, some policyholders' pricing may increase, while the
pricing for other policyholders may decrease, the net impact of which could negatively impact retention and profit margins.
to develop new products or markets, we may need to make substantial capital and operating expenditures, which may also negatively
impact results in the near term.
if
our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets are not successful, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.the
profitability of our
property and casualty business substantially depends on the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in pricing our policies. we utilize third-party and
proprietary models to help us price business in a manner that is intended to be consistent, over time, with actual results and return objectives. we incorporate the company's historical loss
experience, external industry data and economic indices into our modeling processes, and we use various methods, including predictive modeling, forecasting and sophisticated simulation modeling
techniques, to analyze loss trends and the risks associated with our assets and liabilities. we also use these modeling processes, analyses and methods in making underwriting, pricing and reinsurance
decisions as part of managing our exposure to catastrophes and other extreme adverse events. these modeling processes incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and
variability of: interest rates, inflation, capital requirements, and frequency and severity of losses, among others, that are difficult to make and may differ materially from actual results.
whether
we use a proprietary or third-party model, future experience may be materially different from past and current experience incorporated in a model's forecasts or simulations. this
includes the likelihood of events occurring or continuing or the correlation among events. third party models may provide substantially different indications than what our proprietary modeling
processes provide. as a result, third-party model estimates of losses can be, and often have been, materially different for similar events in comparison to our proprietary estimates. the differences
between third-party model estimates
table of contents
and
our proprietary estimates are driven by the use of different data sets as well as different assumptions and forecasts regarding the frequency and severity of events and claims arising from the
events.
if
we fail to appropriately price the risks we insure, or fail to change our pricing model to appropriately reflect our current experience, or if our claims experience is more frequent
or severe than our underlying risk assumptions, our profit margins may be negatively affected. if we underestimate the frequency and/or severity of extreme adverse events occurring, our financial
condition may be adversely affected. if we overestimate the risks we are exposed to, we may overprice our products, and new business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely
affected. as we expand into different markets and geographies, we will write more policies in markets and geographical areas where we have less data specific to these new markets and geographies, and,
accordingly, we may be more susceptible to error in our models and strategy. see "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operationscatastrophe modeling."
our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in
technology.we depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business and processing claims, as well as for providing the data and analytics we
utilize to manage our business, and thus our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems
that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner. some system development projects are long-term in nature, may negatively impact our expense
ratios as we invest in the projects and may cost more than we expect to complete. in addition, system development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are complete, or may be
replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in accelerated recognition of expenses. if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio,
including with respect to the technology portfolio of our recently acquired businesses, or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect, our ability to provide competitive services to new and
existing customers in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted.
if we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security and/or outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively
impacted.while technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives present significant risks.
our business is highly dependent upon our employees' ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions. a shut-down of, or inability to access,
one or more of our facilities (including our primary data processing facility); a power outage; or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could
significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis, particularly if such an interruption lasts for an extended period of time. in the event of a computer virus or disaster
such as a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or industrial accident, our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time. in addition, because our information technology and
telecommunications systems increasingly interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a
third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. business interruptions and failures of controls could also result if our internal systems do not interface with each other as intended,
including as it relates to recently acquired businesses. business continuity can also be disrupted by an event, such as a pandemic, that renders large numbers of a workforce unable to work as needed,
particularly at critical locations; for example, our largest location employs about 20% of our employees. if our business continuity plans did not sufficiently address a business interruption, system
failure or service denial, this could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other
necessary business functions.
table of contents
our
operations rely on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. computer viruses, hackers
and employee or vendor misconduct, and other external hazards, could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. in addition, we routinely transmit and receive
personal, confidential and proprietary information by e-mail and other electronic means. while we attempt to develop secure transmission capabilities with third-party vendors and others with whom we
do business, we may be unable to put in place secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and, in addition, these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect
the confidentiality of the information.
like
other global companies, our computer systems are regularly subject to and will continue to be the target of computer viruses, malware or other malicious codes, unauthorized access,
cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. while we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a material breach of cyber-security.
however, over time, and particularly recently, the sophistication of these threats continues to increase. our administrative and technical controls as well as other preventative actions we take to
reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information may be insufficient to detect or prevent unauthorized access, other physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security
breaches to our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. in addition, new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer
systems to the risk of cyber-attacks.
we
have increasingly outsourced certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may continue to do so in the future. if we do not effectively develop, implement
and monitor our
outsourcing relationships, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize expected productivity improvements
or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business. our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may
expose us to increased risk related to data security or service disruptions, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. for example, while it did not materially and adversely impact our
operations or results, we terminated a contract with one of our outsourcing vendors in the fourth quarter of 2013 because they breached that contract by providing proprietary company information to
one of our competitors. in addition to risks caused by third party providers, our ability to receive services from third party providers outside of the united states might be impacted by cultural
differences, political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or public policy inside or outside of the united states.
the
increased risks identified above could expose us to data loss, disruption of service, monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs and costs to
improve the security and resiliency of our computer systems. the compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could also subject us to legal liability or regulatory action under
evolving cyber-security, data protection and privacy laws and regulations enacted by the u.s. federal and state governments, the european union or other jurisdictions or by various regulatory
organizations or exchanges. as a result, our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations might be materially and adversely affected.
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our business outside the united states.we conduct business outside the united
states primarily
in canada, the united kingdom and the republic of ireland. in addition, we have a joint venture in brazil and may also explore opportunities in other countries, including latin american countries and
other emerging markets such as india.
in
conducting business outside of the united states, we are subject to a number of significant risks, particularly in emerging economies. these risks include restrictions such as price
controls, capital
table of contents
controls,
currency exchange limits, ownership limits and other restrictive or anti-competitive governmental actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation. following
the completion of our acquisition of dominion, a larger portion of our premiums from outside of the united states are now comprised of premiums generated in canada, a substantial portion of which
consists of automobile premiums from the province of ontario, which is a highly regulated market. our business activities outside the united states may also subject us to currency risk and, in some
markets, it may be difficult to effectively hedge that risk, or we may choose not to hedge that risk. in addition, in some markets, we may invest as part of a joint venture with a local
counterparty. because our governance rights may be limited, we may not have control over the ability of the joint venture to make certain decisions and/or mitigate risks it faces, and significant
disagreements with a joint venture counterparty may adversely impact our investment.
our
business activities outside the united states also subject us to additional domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws in
other countries that prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials. although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws, if those
controls are ineffective and an employee or intermediary fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties and our business and our reputation could be
adversely affected. some countries, particularly emerging economies, have laws and regulations that lack clarity and, even with local expertise and effective controls, it can be difficult to determine
the exact requirements of, and potential liability under, the local laws. for example, in some jurisdictions, including brazil, parties to a joint venture may, in some circumstances, have liability
for some obligations of the venture, and that liability may extend beyond the capital invested. failure to comply with local laws in a particular market may result in substantial liability and could
have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally.
in
addition, competition for skilled employees in developing markets and other non-u.s. locations may be intense. if we are not able to hire, integrate, motivate and retain a sufficient
number of employees with the knowledge and background necessary for our global businesses, those businesses and our results of operations may be adversely affected.
new regulations outside of the united states, including in the european union, could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our
growth.insurance laws or regulations that are adopted or amended in jurisdictions outside the u.s. may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and
may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.
in
particular, the european union's executive body, the european commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called solvency ii that would apply to
the company's businesses across the european union. the implementation date of solvency ii has been delayed until january1, 2016, although some aspects, including governance guidelines, own
risk assessments and regulatory reporting, are being phased in before the full implementation date. under solvency ii, it is possible that the u.s. parent of a european union subsidiary could be
subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary's capital position is dependent on the parent company and the u.s. company is not already subject to
regulations deemed "equivalent" to solvency ii. in addition, regulators in countries where the company has operations are working with the international association of insurance supervisors (iais)
(and with the naic, the federal reserve and fio in the u.s.) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including group supervision and group capital requirements.
in
july 2013, the iais published a methodology for identifying "global systemically important insurers" (g-siis) and high level policy measures that will apply to the g-siis. the
methodology and measures were endorsed by the financial stability board (fsb) created by the g-20. using the iais
table of contents
methodology,
the fsb, working with national authorities and the iais, identified nine insurers that they designated as g-siis. the iais is working on the policy measures which include higher capital
requirements and enhanced supervision. the company has not been designated as a g-sii by the fsb; however, the fsb updates the list annually, and it is possible that the methodologies could be amended
or interpreted differently in the future and the company could be named as a g-sii.
the
iais also is in the process of developing the common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups (comframe). the iais released a consultation draft in
october 2013, which may lead to similar policy measures as those being developed for g-siis, including group supervision and an insurance capital standard (i.e., global group capital requirement). the
iais revised the comframe guidance based on comments received and is currently in the process of field testing many of the requirements. the company would be considered an internationally active
insurance group under the current consultation draft. it is possible that comframe, if adopted, could lead to enhanced supervision and higher capital standards on a global basis if the iais, the naic
and the individual states adopt the proposed or similar provisions.
while
it is not yet known how or if these actions will impact us, such regulation could result in increased costs of compliance, increased disclosure and less flexibility in our capital
management, and could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our growth.
loss of or significant restrictions on the use of particular types of underwriting criteria, such as credit scoring, in the pricing and underwriting of our products could reduce our
future profitability.our underwriting profitability depends in large part on our ability to competitively price our products at a level that will adequately
compensate us for the risks assumed. as a result, risk selection and pricing through the application of actuarially sound and segmented underwriting criteria is critical. however, laws or regulations,
or judicial or administrative findings, could significantly curtail the use of particular types of underwriting criteria. for example, we may use credit scoring as a factor in pricing decisions where
allowed by state law. some consumer groups and/or regulators have alleged that the use of credit scoring violates the law by discriminating against persons belonging to a protected class and are
calling for the prohibition or restrictions on the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing. a variety of other underwriting criteria used in personal and commercial insurance have been and
continue to be criticized by regulators, government agencies, consumer groups or individuals on similar or other grounds. resulting regulatory actions or litigation could result in negative publicity
and/or
generate adverse rules or findings, such as curtailing the use of important underwriting criteria, each of which could adversely affect our future profitability.
acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences.from time
to time we may
investigate and pursue acquisition opportunities if we believe that such opportunities are consistent with our long-term objectives and that the potential rewards of an acquisition justify the risks.
for example, in november 2013, we acquired dominion and significantly expanded our canadian operations. the process of integrating an acquired company or business can be complex and costly, however,
and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. for example, acquisitions may present significant risks, including:
the potential disruption of our ongoing business;
the ineffective integration of, or other difficulties with, underwriting, risk management, claims handling, information technology and
actuarial practices;
uncertainties related to an acquiree's reserve estimates and its design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting;
the diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges;
the loss of key employees;
table of contents
unforeseen liabilities;
the cultural challenges associated with integrating employees; and
the impact on our financial position and/or credit ratings.
acquired
businesses may not perform as projected, any cost savings and other synergies anticipated from the acquisition may not materialize and costs associated with the integration may
be greater than anticipated. acquired businesses may not be successfully integrated, resulting in substantial costs or delays and adversely affecting our ability to compete. accordingly, our results
of operations might be materially and adversely affected.
we could be adversely affected if our controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not
effective.our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claim processing and investment
activities, many of which are highly complex. these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards. a control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. if our controls are not effective, it could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk
exposure (including underwriting, credit and investment risk) or damage to our reputation.
in
addition, ineffective controls, including with respect to our recently acquired businesses, could lead to litigation or regulatory action. the volume of claims and amount of damages
and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against various types of financial institutions have increased in
recent years. substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse financial impact. see note16 of notes to our consolidated financial
statements for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.
our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.there is significant competition from
within the
property and casualty insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those possessing highly specialized underwriting
knowledge. our performance is largely dependent on the talents, efforts and proper conduct of highly-skilled individuals, including our senior executives (many of whom have decades of experience in
the insurance industry), and the board of directors regularly engages in succession discussions. each of our chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer and chief investment officer is
highly experienced and over 61years of age, and our chief executive officer announced in 2014 that he had been diagnosed with a neuromuscular condition. see
"item10directors, executive officers and corporate governance" for more information relating to our executive officers, including our senior leaders. for many of our senior
positions, we compete for talent not just with insurance or financial service companies, but with other large companies and other businesses. our continued ability to compete effectively in our
businesses and to expand into new business areas depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. if we are not able to successfully attract, retain
and motivate our employees, our business, financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.
intellectual property is important to our business, and we may be unable to protect and enforce our own intellectual property or we may be subject to claims for infringing the
intellectual property of others.our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary trademarks, technology and other intellectual property.
see "item1other informationintellectual property." we may not, however, be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use and disclosure by others.
further, the intellectual property laws may not prevent our competitors from independently developing trademarks, products and services that are similar to ours. moreover, the agreements we execute to
protect our intellectual property rights may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies in response. our attempts to patent or register our intellectual property rights
table of contents
in
the u.s. and worldwide may not succeed initially or may later be challenged by third parties. further, the laws of certain countries outside the united states may not adequately protect our
intellectual property rights. we may incur significant costs in our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property, including the initiation of expensive and protracted litigation, and we
may not prevail. any inability to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.
we
may be subject to claims by third parties from time to time that our products, services and technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. in recent years, certain
entities have acquired patents in order to allege claims of infringement against companies, including in some cases, us. any intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could cause us
to spend significant time and money to defend ourselves, regardless of the merits of the claims. if we are found to infringe any third-party intellectual property rights, it could result in
reputational harm, payment of significant monetary damages, payment of license fees (if licenses are even available to us, on reasonable terms or otherwise) and/or substantial time and expense to
redesign our products, services or technologies to avoid the infringement. in addition, we use third-party software in some of our products, services and technologies. if any of our software vendors
or licensors are faced with infringement claims, we may lose our ability to use such software until the dispute is resolved. if we cannot successfully redesign an infringing product, service or
technology (or procure a substitute version), this could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.
changes to existing accounting standards may adversely impact our reported results.as a u.s.-based sec registrant, we are currently
required to
prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s.gaap), as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board (fasb), subject to the
accounting-related rules and interpretations of the securities and exchange commission (sec). during the last several years, the sec has been evaluating whether, when and how international financial
reporting standards (ifrs) should be incorporated into the u.s. financial reporting system, including for companies such as us. in december 2014, the sec indicated that it plans to explore allowing
ifrs financial statements or financial information as supplemental information in sec filings.
the
fasb and the international accounting standards board (iasb) have been working on a long-term project to converge u.s.gaap and ifrs, which included a project on insurance
accounting. while the fasb decided during 2014 to retain current u.s.gaap for property and casualty insurance contracts, the iasb is continuing its development of a new model that is
significantly different than current u.s.gaap.
we
are not able to predict whether we will choose to, or be required to, adopt ifrs or how the adoption of ifrs (or the convergence of u.s.gaap and ifrs, including the project on
the accounting for insurance contracts) may impact our financial statements in the future. changes in accounting standards, particularly those that specifically apply to insurance company operations,
may impact the content and presentation of our reported financial results and could cause increased volatility in reported earnings, resulting in other adverse impacts on the company's ratings and
cost of capital, and decrease the understandability of our financial results as well as the comparability of our reported results with other insurers.
changes in u.s. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely
impact us.tax laws may change in ways that adversely impact us. for example, federal tax legislation could be enacted to reduce the existing statutory u.s.
federal corporate income tax rate from 35%, which would, accordingly, reduce any u.s. deferred tax asset. the amount of any net deferred tax asset is volatile and significantly impacted by changes in
unrealized investment gains and losses. the effect of a reduction in a tax rate on net deferred tax assets is required to be recognized, in full, as a reduction of income from continuing operations in
the period when enacted and, along with
table of contents
other
changes in the tax rules that may increase the company's actual tax expense, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
our
investment portfolio has benefited from tax exemptions and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such
as foreign tax credits). federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted in connection with deficit reduction or various types of fundamental tax reform that would lessen or eliminate some or
all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us and therefore could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, such legislation could adversely affect the value of our
investment portfolio, particularly changes to the taxation of interest from municipal bonds (which comprise 46% of our investment portfolio as of december31, 2014) could materially and
adversely impact the value of those bonds.
other

plans meeting the requirements of rule10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. the authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. the
timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses,
maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the company's
operating subsidiaries, legal
requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors.

the
following discussions of the company's net income and segment operating income are presented on an after-tax basis. discussions of the components of net income and segment operating
income are presented on a pretax basis, unless otherwise noted. discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis.
overview
diluted net income per share of $10.70 in 2014 increased by 10% over diluted net income per share of $9.74 in 2013. net income of
$3.69billion in 2014 increased slightly over net income of $3.67billion in 2013. the higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases
in recent periods. the slight increase in net income was primarily driven by the pretax impacts of (i)higher underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve
development ("underlying underwriting margins"), (ii)higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (iii)higher net investment income, partially offset by (iv)higher
catastrophe losses, (v)a decline in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal matter in 2013 and (vi)lower net realized investment gains. catastrophe losses in 2014
and 2013 were $709million and $591million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was
table of contents
$941million
and $840million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impacts of (i)earned pricing that exceeded loss cost
trends in each of the company's business segments, (ii)lower reinsurance costs and (iii)a 2014 reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments to be paid by the company
related to workers' compensation premiums, partially offset by (iv)an increase in non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (v)a higher level of what the company defines as large
losses. partially offsetting this net pretax increase in income was an increase in income tax expense. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 resulted from the impact of a
$63million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 due to the resolution of prior year tax matters, as well as interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower
than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2014 than in 2013.
diluted
net income per share of $9.74 in 2013 increased by 55% over diluted net income per share of $6.30 in 2012. net income of $3.67billion in 2013 increased by 49% over net
income of $2.47billion in 2012. the higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in 2013 and 2012. the increase in net income primarily
reflected the pretax impacts of
(i)lower catastrophe losses, (ii)higher underlying underwriting margins, (iii)an increase in net realized investment gains and (iv)an increase in other revenues due to
a gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, partially offset by (v)lower net investment income and (vi)lower net favorable prior year reserve development. catastrophe losses in
2013 and 2012 were $591million and $1.86billion, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $840million and $940million,
respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends in each of the company's business segments.
partially offsetting this net pretax increase in income was an increase in income tax expense. the higher effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 resulted from interest on municipal bonds, which is
effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2013 than in 2012, partially offset by the resolution of prior year tax
matters discussed above.
revenues
earned premiums
earned premiums in 2014 were $23.71billion, $1.08billion or 5% higher than in 2013. the increase in earned premiums in
2014 primarily reflected the impact of the acquisition of dominion on november1, 2013. in the business and international insurance segment, earned premiums in 2014 increased by 9% over 2013,
primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of dominion. in the bond& specialty insurance segment, earned premiums in 2014 increased by 5% over 2013. in the personal insurance segment,
earned premiums in 2014 decreased by 3% from 2013.
earned
premiums in 2013 were $22.64billion, $280million or 1% higher than in 2012. in the business and international insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 increased
by 4% over 2012. in the bond& specialty insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 increased by 1% over 2012. in the personal insurance segment, earned premiums in 2013 decreased by 4% from
2012.
factors
contributing to the changes in earned premiums in each segment in 2014 and 2013 compared with the respective prior year are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions
that follow.

net
investment income in 2014 was $2.79billion, $71million or 3% higher than in 2013. net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2014 was
$2.24billion, $66million lower than in 2013, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of
dominion. net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2014 was $573million, $141million higher than in 2013, primarily driven by higher
returns from the company's private equity investments, as well as higher returns from real estate partnership investments.
net
investment income in 2013 was $2.72billion, $173million or 6% lower than in 2012. net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2013 was
$2.31billion, $129million lower than in 2012, primarily resulting from lower long-term reinvestment yields available in the market. net investment income generated by non-fixed
maturity investments in 2013 was $432million, $44million lower than in 2012, primarily driven by lower returns from the company's real estate partnership investments.
fee income
the national accounts market in the business and international insurance segment is the primary source of the company's fee-based
business. the $43million and $72million increases in fee income in 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared with the respective prior years are described in the business and international
insurance segment discussion that follows.

remaining
$70million of other net realized gains in 2014 were primarily driven by $32million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $24million
of net realized investment
gains related to equity securities, $8million of net realized investment gains related to other investments and $6million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales.
other
net realized gains in 2013 of $181million were primarily driven by $115million of net realized gains associated with u.s. treasury futures contracts, which require
daily mark-to-market settlement and are used from time to time to shorten the duration of the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. the remaining $66million of other net realized
investment gains in 2013 were primarily driven by $41million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments, $15million of net realized investment gains related
to equity securities and $10million of net realized investment gains related to other investments.
other
net realized investment gains in 2012 of $66million were primarily driven by $61million of net realized investment gains related to fixed maturity investments,
$19million of net realized investment gains related to real estate and $8million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities. these net realized investment gains were
partially offset by $14million of net realized investment losses associated with u.s. treasury futures contracts and $8million of net realized investment losses related to other
investments.
other revenues
the amount of other revenues in all years presented primarily consisted of installment premium charges. other revenues in 2013 also
included a $91million gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, which is discussed in more detail in note16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements, and a
$20million gain from the sale of renewal rights related to the company's national flood insurance program business.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $13.87billion, $563million or 4% higher than in 2013, primarily
reflecting (i)the impact of the acquisition of dominion, (ii)the impact of loss cost trends, (iii)higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (iv)higher catastrophe
losses and (v)a higher level of what the company defines as large losses, partially offset by (vi)the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the
acquisition of dominion) and (vii)higher net favorable prior year reserve development. catastrophe losses in 2014 included multiple wind and hail storms in several regions of the united states
and a winter storm in the mid-atlantic, midwestern and southeastern regions of the united states. catastrophe losses in 2013 resulted from multiple tornado, wind and hail storms in several regions of
the united states, as well as floods in alberta, canada and storm xaver in the united kingdom. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development in each segment are discussed in
more detail in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $13.31billion, $1.37billion or 9% lower than in 2012, primarily reflecting (i)a decline in catastrophe losses
and (ii)the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the acquisition of dominion), partially offset by (iii)the impact of loss cost trends, (iv)the
impact of the acquisition of dominion and (v)lower net favorable prior year reserve development. catastrophe losses in 2012 primarily resulted from storm sandy, as well as multiple tornado,
wind and hail storms in several regions of the united states. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 was reduced by a $42million charge that was precipitated by legislation in
new york enacted during the first quarter of 2013 related to the new york fund for reopened cases for workers' compensation. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve

development
in each segment are discussed in more detail in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
significant catastrophe losses
the company defines a "catastrophe" as an event that:
is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from
catastrophic events, such as property claim services (pcs) for events in the united states and canada; and
the company's estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold.
the
company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is determined at the reportable segment level. if a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is pierced and the other
segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the company. the threshold for 2014
ranged from approximately $17million to $30million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.
the
following table presents for significant catastrophes the amount of losses recorded in each of the years ended december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and the amount of related net
unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in subsequent years as well as the estimate of ultimate losses at december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. for purposes of the table,
a significant catastrophe is an event for which the company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100million or more after reinsurance and before taxes.

$89million or 2% lower than in 2012. amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.
table of contents
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses in 2014 were $3.95billion, $195million or 5% higher than in 2013. the increase in
2014 primarily reflected the impact of the acquisition of dominion and increases in employee and technology related expenses, partially offset by a reduction in the estimated liability for state
assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums. general and administrative expenses in 2013 were $3.76billion, $147million or 4% higher than in 2012. general and
administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.

increase in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily reflected slightly higher average levels of debt outstanding. the decline in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily reflected lower average levels of debt
outstanding.
income tax expense
income tax expense in 2014 was $1.40billion, $125million or 10% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of
a $63million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters, as well as the tax effects of the $144million increase in income before
income taxes in 2014. income tax expense in 2013 was $1.27billion, $579million or 84% higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of the tax effects of the

matters in 2013.
the
company's effective tax rate was 27%, 26% and 22% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effective tax rates in all years were lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due
to the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the company's income tax provision. in addition, the effective tax rate for 2013 was reduced by the impact of the resolution of
prior year tax matters.
combined ratio
the combined ratio of 89.0% in 2014 was 0.8points lower than the combined ratio of 89.8% in 2013.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.6% in 2014 was 0.3points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.9% in 2013. catastrophe losses accounted for
3.0points and 2.6points of the 2014 and 2013 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 provided
3.9points and 3.7points of benefit, respectively, to the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. the 2014 loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development ("underlying loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio") was 0.5points lower than the 2013 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by the impact of an
increase in non-catastrophe weather-related losses and a higher level of what the company defines as large losses.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 31.4% in 2014 was 0.5points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 31.9% in 2013, primarily reflecting lower commission expenses in the
personal insurance segment and a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums in the business and international insurance segment,
partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses described above.

overview
operating income in 2014 was $2.35billion, $57million or 2% lower than operating income of $2.40billion in
2013. the decrease in operating income in 2014 primarily reflected an increase in income taxes and a slight decrease in operating income before income taxes. the slight decrease in operating income
before income taxes reflected the pretax impacts of (i)lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii)a decline in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement of a legal
matter in 2013 and (iii)higher catastrophe losses, largely offset by (iv)higher underlying underwriting margins and (v)an increase in net investment income. catastrophe losses
in 2014 and 2013 were $367million and $333million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was $322million and $399million,
respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins in 2014 primarily reflected (i)earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and (ii)a reduction in the estimated
liability for state assessments to be paid by the company related to workers' compensation premiums, partially offset by (iii)higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (iv)a
higher level of what the company defines as large losses. the increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the impact of a $43million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting
from the resolution of prior year tax matters. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 primarily resulted from the impact of the reduction in income tax expense in 2013 described above.
operating
income in 2013 was $2.40billion, $423million or 21% higher than operating income of $1.98billion in 2012. the increase in operating income primarily
reflected the pretax impacts of (i)lower catastrophe losses, (ii)higher underlying underwriting margins and (iii)an increase in other revenues due to a gain from the settlement
of a legal matter, partially offset by (iv)lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (v)lower net investment income. catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were
$333million and $829million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $399million and $585million, respectively. net favorable
prior year reserve development in 2013 was reduced by a $42million charge that was precipitated by legislation in new york as described in the consolidated "claims and claim adjustment
expenses" section above. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. partially offsetting this net pretax
increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. the higher effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 primarily resulted from the impact of interest on municipal bonds, which is
effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than

the
corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2013 than in 2012, partially offset by the resolution of prior year tax matters in 2013 described above.
revenues
earned premiums
earned premiums in 2014 were $14.51billion, $1.18billion or 9% higher than in 2013. earned premiums in 2013 were
$13.33billion, $553million or 4% higher than in 2012. the increases in both 2014 and 2013 reflected the impact of an increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.
the increase in net written premiums in 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of dominion. the increase in net written premiums in 2013 also included, to a lesser extent, the impact of the
acquisition of dominion, which occurred on november1, 2013.
net investment income
net investment income in 2014 was $2.16billion, $69million or 3% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact
of the acquisition of dominion. net investment income in 2013 was $2.09billion, $118million or 5% lower than in 2012. included in the business and international insurance segment are
certain legal entities whose invested assets and related net investment income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. refer to the "net investment
income" section of the "consolidated results of operations" discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the changes in the company's consolidated net investment income in 2014
and 2013 compared with the respective prior years. in addition, refer to note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements herein for a discussion of the company's net
investment income allocation methodology.
fee income
national accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services
to large companies that choose to self-insure a portion of their insurance risks, as well as claims and policy management services to workers' compensation residual market pools. fee income in 2014
increased by $43million or 11% over 2013. fee income in 2013 increased by $72million or 22% over 2012. the increases in both years primarily reflected higher serviced premium volume in
workers' compensation residual market pools and higher claim volume in the large deductible business.
other revenues
other revenues in 2013 included a $91million gain from the settlement of a legal proceeding, which is discussed in more detail
in note16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $9.15billion, $860million or 10% higher than in 2013, primarily
reflecting (i)the impact of the acquisition of dominion, (ii)the impact of loss cost trends, (iii)higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (iv)a higher level of
what the company defines as large losses, (v)a decline in net favorable prior year reserve development and (vi)higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (vii)the impact of
lower volumes of insured exposures (excluding the impact of the acquisition of dominion). factors
contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
table of contents
claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $8.29billion, $98million or 1% lower than in 2012, primarily reflecting (i)a decline in catastrophe losses and
(ii)the impact of a modest decline in volumes of insured exposures (excluding dominion), partially offset by (iii)the impact of loss cost trends, (iv)a decrease in net
favorable prior year reserve development and (v)the impact of the acquisition of dominion. factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in
note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
amortization of deferred acquisition costs
amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2014 was $2.32billion, $163million or 8% higher than in 2013, primarily
reflecting the impact of the acquisition of dominion. amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2013 was $2.16billion, $58million or 3% higher than in 2012. the increase in 2013
was generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses in 2014 were $2.54billion, $172million or 7% higher than in 2013, primarily
reflecting the impact of the acquisition of dominion and increases in employee and technology related expenses, partially offset by a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments
primarily related to workers' compensation premiums. general and administrative expenses in 2013 were $2.37billion, $65million or 3% higher than in 2012, primarily due to the impact of
the acquisition of dominion and higher employee and technology related costs.
income tax expense
income tax expense in 2014 was $798million, $40million or 5% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of a
$43million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters, partially offset by the tax effect of the $17million decrease in pre-tax
operating income in 2014. income tax expense in 2013 was $758million, $178million or 31% higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the tax effect of the $601million increase in
pre-tax operating income and the reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters discussed above.
combined ratio
the combined ratio of 93.1% in 2014 was 0.3points higher than the combined ratio of 92.8% in 2013.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.6% in 2014 was 0.8points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.8% in 2013. catastrophe losses in 2014 and
2013 accounted for 2.5points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in each year. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 provided 2.2points and
3.0points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2014 was level with the 2013 ratio on the same
basis, as the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends was offset by higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and a higher level of what the company defines as large losses.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 31.5% in 2014 was 0.5points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 32.0% in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in earned
premiums and a reduction in the estimated liability for state assessments primarily related to workers' compensation premiums, partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses
discussed above.
the
combined ratio of 92.8% in 2013 was 4.3points lower than the combined ratio of 97.1% in 2012.
table of contents
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.8% in 2013 was 3.5points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 64.3% in 2012. catastrophe losses in 2013 and
2012 accounted for 2.5points and 6.5points, respectively, of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 provided
3.0points and 4.6points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. the 2013 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 1.1points lower
than the 2012 ratio on the same basis, reflecting the impact of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by the impact of a change in business mix due to an increase in
longer-tail loss-sensitive business in national accounts.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 32.0% in 2013 was 0.8points lower than the 2012 underwriting expense ratio of 32.8%. the decrease in 2013 primarily reflected the impact of
growth in earned premiums.

overview
operating income in 2014 was $727million, $154million or 27% higher than operating income of $573million in
2013, primarily reflecting the pretax impacts of (i)higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii)higher underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by
(iii)lower net investment income. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was $450million and $232million, respectively. catastrophe losses in 2014 and
2013 were $6million and $8million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the pretax impact of lower reinsurance costs. partially
offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. the higher effective tax rate in 2014 than in 2013 resulted from the impact of interest on municipal
bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a lower percentage of pretax income in 2014 than in 2013, as well as the impact of a
$15million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 due to the resolution of prior year tax matters.
operating
income in 2013 was $573million, $69million or 14% higher than operating income of $504million in 2012. the increase in operating income primarily
reflected the pretax impact of (i)higher underlying underwriting margins and (ii)higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (iii)lower net
investment income. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $232million and $180million, respectively. catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were
$8million and $15million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins was driven by (i)earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by
(ii)higher general and administrative expenses and (iii)the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures. partially offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an
increase in income tax expense. the lower effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 was primarily due to the resolution of prior year tax matters described above.

income are reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. as a result, reported net investment income in the bond& specialty insurance segment reflects a
significantly smaller proportion of allocated net investment income, including that from the company's non-fixed maturity investments that experienced an increase in investment income in 2014 and a
decrease in investment income in 2013. refer to the "net investment income" section of the "consolidated results of operations" discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the

general and administrative expenses in 2014 were $403million, $15million or 4% higher than in 2013. general and
administrative expenses in 2013 were $388million, $5million or 1% higher than in 2012. the increases in both years primarily reflected the impact of higher employee and technology
related expenses.
table of contents
income tax expense
income tax expense in 2014 was $348million, $121million or 53% higher than in 2013, primarily reflecting the tax effect
of the $275million increase in pre-tax operating income, as well as the impact of a $15million reduction in income tax expenses in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax
matters. income tax expense in 2013 was $227million, $13million or 6% higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the tax effect of the $82million increase in pre-tax operating
income, partially offset by the impact of the $15million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters.
combined ratio
the combined ratio of 60.8% in 2014 was 12.6 points lower than the combined ratio of 73.4% in 2013.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 22.8% in 2014 was 11.9 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 34.7% in 2013. net favorable prior year reserve
development in 2014 and 2013 provided 21.7 points and 11.7 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 accounted for 0.3 points
and 0.4 points, respectively, of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2014 was 1.8 points lower than the 2013 ratio on the same basis,
primarily reflecting the impact of lower reinsurance costs.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 38.0% in 2014 was 0.7 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 38.7% in 2013. the improvement in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of
increases in earned premiums largely due to lower reinsurance costs.

overview
operating income in 2014 was $824million, $14million or 2% lower than operating income of $838million in 2013.
the decrease in operating income primarily reflected the pretax impacts of (i)an increase in catastrophe losses, (ii)lower net favorable prior year reserve development and
(iii)a decline in other revenues, partially offset by (iv)higher underlying underwriting margins and (v)higher net investment income. catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013 were
$336million and $250million, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 was $169million and $209million, respectively. the improvement
in underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected (i)earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and (ii)the benefit of the company's previously announced expense reduction
initiatives, partially offset by (iii)the impact of a higher mix of new business versus renewal business. income tax expense in 2014 was level with 2013. the higher effective tax rate in 2014
than in 2013 primarily resulted from the impact of a $5million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 due to the resolution of prior year tax matters.
table of contents
operating
income in 2013 was $838million, $621million higher than operating income of $217million in 2012. the increase in operating income primarily reflected
the pretax impact of (i)lower catastrophe losses, (ii)higher underlying underwriting margins, (iii)an increase in other revenues and (iv)higher net favorable prior year
reserve development, partially offset by (v)lower net investment income. catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 were $250million and $1.02billion, respectively. net favorable
prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 was $209million and $175million, respectively. the improvement in underlying underwriting margins resulted from the impact of earned
pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. partially offsetting this net pretax increase in operating income was an increase in income tax expense. the
higher effective tax rate in 2013 than in 2012 primarily resulted from interest on municipal bonds, which is effectively taxed at a rate that is lower than the corporate tax rate of 35%, comprising a
lower percentage of pretax income in 2013 than in 2012.
revenues
earned premiums
earned premiums in 2014 were $7.13billion, $199million or 3% lower than in 2013. earned premiums in 2013 were
$7.32billion, $297million or 4% lower than in 2012. the declines in both years reflected reductions in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.
net investment income
net investment income in 2014 was $379million, $10million or 3% higher than in 2013. net investment income in 2013 was
$369million, $35million or 9% lower than in 2012. refer to the "net investment income" section of "consolidated results of operations" herein for a discussion of the changes in the
company's net investment income in 2014 and 2013 as compared with the respective prior year. in addition, refer to note2 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements herein for
a discussion of the company's net investment income allocation methodology.
other revenues
other revenues in all years presented primarily consisted of installment premium charges. other revenues in 2013 also included a
$20million gain from the sale of renewal rights related to the company's national flood insurance program (nfip) business. the company was a participant in the nfip write your own program
administered by the federal emergency management agency (fema) and the federal insurance& mitigation administration.
claims and expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses
claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2014 were $4.24billion, $83million or 2% lower than in 2013. the decrease
primarily reflected (i)the impact of lower volumes of insured exposures and (ii)the benefit of the company's previously announced expense reduction initiatives on claim adjustment
expenses, partially offset by (iii)higher catastrophe losses, (iv)the impact of loss cost trends and (v)lower net favorable prior year reserve development. factors contributing
to net favorable prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note7 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2013 were $4.33billion, $1.18billion or 21% lower than in 2012. the decrease primarily reflected (i)lower catastrophe

amortization of deferred acquisition costs
amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2014 was $1.17billion, $112million or 9% lower than in 2013. the decrease
in 2014 primarily reflected a decline in
commission expense due to lower commission rates, as well as a decline in earned premiums compared with 2013. amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2013 was $1.29billion,
$152million or 11% lower than in 2012. the decrease in 2013 reflected (i)the decline in earned premiums compared with 2012, (ii)a reclassification of fee income related to the
national flood insurance program from general and administrative expenses to a component of acquisition costs to conform to the presentation prescribed by insurance regulators, and (iii)lower
fixed-value commission expense due to an increase in the number of agents reverting to a contingent commission compensation program.
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses in 2014 were $977million, $3million or less than 1% lower than in 2013. the
decrease in 2014 primarily reflected the impact of the company's expense reduction initiatives, largely offset by higher contingent commission expenses and higher underwriting expenses resulting from
higher new business levels. general and administrative expenses in 2013 were $980million, $80million or 9% higher than in 2012. the increase in 2013 included an increase in contingent
commission expense due to an increase in the number of agents reverting from a fixed-value commission compensation program to a contingent commission compensation program and the impact of the
reclassification of fee income described above. the increase in 2013 also included the impact of $12million of restructuring charges, primarily comprised of severance costs related to the
company's announced plan to reduce certain claim and other insurance expenses in this segment. these factors were partially offset by a decline in advertising expense.
income tax expense
income tax expense in 2014 was $366million, level with 2013, as the tax effect of the $14million decrease in pre-tax
operating income was offset by the impact of a $5million reduction in income tax expense in 2013 resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters. income tax expense in 2013 was
$366million, $334million higher than in 2012, primarily reflecting the impacts of the $955million increase in pre-tax operating income, partially offset by a reduction in
income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters in 2013.
combined ratio
the combined ratio of 88.7% in 2014 was 0.2 points lower than the combined ratio of 88.9% in 2013.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.6% in 2014 was 0.5 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.1% in 2013. catastrophe losses in 2014 and 2013
accounted for 4.7 points and 3.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2014 and 2013 provided 2.4 points and 2.8 points
of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. the 2014 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 1.2 points lower than the 2013 ratio on the same basis,
primarily reflecting (i)earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and (ii)the benefit of the company's previously announced expense reduction initiatives, partially offset by
(iii)the impact of a higher mix of new business versus renewal business.
table of contents
the
underwriting expense ratio of 29.1% in 2014 was 0.7 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.8% in 2013. the decrease in 2014 primarily reflected (i)lower
homeowners' commission rates and (ii)the benefit of the company's expense reduction initiatives, partially offset by (iii)higher underwriting expenses resulting from higher new
business levels and (iv)a decrease in earned premiums.
the
combined ratio of 88.9% in 2013 was 13.0 points lower than the combined ratio of 101.9% in 2012.
the
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.1% in 2013 was 13.2 points lower than the 2012 ratio of 72.3%. catastrophe losses in 2013 and 2012 accounted for 3.4 and 13.4 points of
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. net favorable prior year reserve development in 2013 and 2012 provided 2.8 points and 2.3 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio, respectively. the 2013 underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was 2.7 points lower than the 2012 ratio on the same basis, reflecting impact of earned pricing that exceeded
loss cost trends and lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses.
the
underwriting expense ratio of 29.8% in 2013 was 0.2 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.6% in 2012. the increase in 2013 primarily reflected the decrease in
earned premiums and the expense factors discussed above.

in
2014, gross and net agency written premiums were 4% and 1% lower, respectively, than in 2013. the higher rate of decrease in gross written premiums in 2014 was primarily driven by the
impact of the sale of the company's nfip business in 2013 described above. in 2013, gross and net agency written premiums were both 5% lower than in 2012. renewal rate changes exceeded expected loss
cost trends in 2013 assuming weather patterns consistent with the company's expectations.
in
2014, net written premiums in the agency automobile line of business were slightly higher than in 2013. business retention rates remained strong in 2014 and were higher than in 2013.
renewal premium changes in 2014 remained positive but were lower than in 2013, primarily due to lower renewal rate changes. new business premiums in 2014 were significantly higher than in 2013 as a
result of the company's new private passenger automobile product, quantum auto 2.0. in 2013 in the agency automobile line of business, net written premiums were 8% lower than in 2012. business
retention rates in 2013 remained strong but were lower than in 2012, while new business premiums in 2013 decreased from 2012. renewal premium changes in 2013 remained positive and were higher than in
2012, primarily driven by renewal rate changes.
table of contents
in 2014, net written premiums in the agency homeowners and other line of business were 2% lower than 2013 as a result of ongoing underwriting actions taken in
response to the severe weather events that have occurred over the last several years, including seeking improved rates where the company believes it is appropriate, as well as improved terms and
conditions. business retention rates remained strong in 2014 and were higher than in 2013. renewal premium changes in 2014 remained positive but were lower than in 2013, primarily due to lower renewal
rate changes. new business premiums in 2014 were higher than in 2013. in 2013 in the agency homeowners and other line of business, net written premiums were 3% lower than in 2012 as a result of the
ongoing underwriting actions described above. business retention rates remained strong but were lower than in 2012. renewal premium changes in 2013 remained positive but were lower than in 2012. new
business premiums in 2013 decreased from 2012.
for
its agency business, the personal insurance segment had approximately 6.0million and 6.2million active policies at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
direct to consumer written premiums
in its direct to consumer business, net written premiums in 2014 were $187million, $25million or 15% higher than in
2013. in 2014, automobile net written premiums increased by $18million or 16% over 2013, and homeowners and other net written premiums increased by $7million or 14% over 2013. net
written premiums in 2013 were $162million, $4million or 3% higher than in 2012. in 2013, homeowners and other net written premiums increased by $7million, or 16% over 2012,
partially offset by a decline of $3million, or 3%, in automobile net written premiums compared to 2012. the direct to consumer business had 193,000 and 166,000 active policies at
december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

asbestos claims and litigation
the company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have
expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. the company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims
from the company's policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy). factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos
claimants and the continued focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. the focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of
traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility
of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the company. the bankruptcy of many
traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those
table of contents
policyholders
who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their
injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket.
prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim
adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the company. the company's asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other
insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers.
the
company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or
a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. in these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated
as a separate occurrence under the policy. it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor
and other company defenses are not successful, the company's coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and
the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. although the company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict
the ultimate cost of these claims.
many
coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of
settlement negotiations. settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than
originally anticipated. there also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement, which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the
company. as in the past, the company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.
in
addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to
the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. travelers property casualty corp. (tpc) had previously entered into
settlement agreements in connection with a number of these direct action claims (direct action settlements). the company had been involved in litigation concerning whether all of the conditions of the
direct action settlements had been satisfied. on july22, 2014, the united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that all of the conditions of the direct action settlements had
been satisfied. on january15, 2015, the bankruptcy court entered an order directing the company to pay $579million to the plaintiffs, and the company has made that payment. for a full
discussion of these settlement agreements and related litigation, see the "asbestos direct action litigation" section of note16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements herein. it is
possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the company, could be made in the future. it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether
the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. the company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received
favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.
because
each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. among the factors
which the company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; limits
and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future
table of contents
claim
activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of
non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos
claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.
in
the third quarter of 2014, the company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and
"non-product" liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:
continued high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness,
primarily involving mesothelioma claims;
while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to the
continued high level of litigation activity; and
continued moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity.
while
the company believes that over the past several years there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the company's overall asbestos exposure, there nonetheless
remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims.
the
home office and field office categories, which account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, experienced a slight increase in net
asbestos-related payments in 2014 when compared with 2013. the number of policyholders with pending asbestos claims in these categories as of december31, 2014 was essentially unchanged when
compared with december31, 2013. payments on behalf of policyholders in these categories continue to be influenced by the high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions
where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation.
the
company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder
bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. the company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office, field office and assumed reinsurance and other
categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. in addition, the company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any
emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. conventional actuarial methods are not utilized
to establish asbestos reserves nor have the company's evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.
the
completion of these reviews and analyses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 resulted in $250million, $190million and $175million increases, respectively, in the company's
net asbestos reserves. in each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of
policyholders in the home office category due to a higher level of litigation activity surrounding mesothelioma claims than previously anticipated. in addition, the reserve increases in 2013 and 2012
also reflected higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance accounts. the increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher
than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above. notwithstanding these trends, the company's overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is
essentially unchanged from recent periods and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.
net
asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $242million, $218million and $236million, respectively. approximately 8%, 1% and 6% of total
net paid losses in 2014, 2013

"policyholders with settlement agreements" category includes structured settlements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to tpc, wellington accounts. reserves are based
on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. structured settlements are arrangements
under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times. coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with policyholders on specified amounts
of coverage to be provided. payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. wellington accounts refer to the 35 defendants that are parties to
a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. many of the aspects of the wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place
arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. as discussed above, on july22, 2014, the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that all the conditions of the direct action settlements had been satisfied. as a result, during the third quarter of 2014, $502million of
reserves included in the unallocated ibnr component in the "home office and field office" category were reclassified to the "policyholders with settlement agreements" category. for a full discussion
of these settlement agreements, including the payment of this settlement and related interest in january 2015, see the "settlement of asbestos direct action litigation" section of note16 of
notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the
"home office and field office" category relates to all other policyholders and also includes ibnr reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage
litigation. ibnr reserves in the "home office and field office" category include amounts for new claims from and adverse development on existing "home office and field office" policyholders, as well
as reserves for claims from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. policyholders are identified for the annual home
office review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of
reported claims, products/completed operations and potential "non-product" exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. the "assumed
reinsurance and other" category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations.
on
january29, 2009, the company and ppg industries, inc ("ppg"), along with approximately 30 other insurers of ppg, agreed in principle to an agreement to settle asbestos-related
coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to ppg. the tentative settlement agreement has been incorporated into the modified third amended plan of reorganization ("amended plan") proposed as
part of the pittsburgh corning corp. ("pcc," which is 50% owned by ppg) bankruptcy proceeding. pursuant to the proposed amended plan, which was filed on january30, 2009, pcc, along with
enumerated other companies (including ppg as well as the company as a participating insurer), are to receive protections
table of contents
afforded
by section524(g) of the bankruptcy code from certain asbestos-related bodily injury claims. under the agreement in principle, the company has the option to make a series of payments
over the next 20years totaling approximately $620million to the trust to be created under the amended plan, or it may elect to make a one-time discounted payment, which, as of
march31, 2015, would total approximately $505million (approximately $476million after reinsurance). the agreement in principle
with ppg is subject to numerous contingencies, including final court approval of the amended plan, and the company has no obligation to make the settlement payment until all contingencies are
satisfied. the company's obligations under this agreement in principle are included in the "home office and field office" category in the preceding table.

environmental claims and litigation
the company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage
arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances. mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. for instance, the
comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with
respect to releases and threatened releases
of hazardous substances. this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. liability under
cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties.
table of contents
the
company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. the company believes that some court decisions
have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. these decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the company
prior to the mid-1980s. these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. environmental claims, when submitted, rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought
by the claimant from the policyholder, and the company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.
the
resolution of environmental exposures by the company generally occurs through settlements with policyholders as opposed to claimants. generally, the company strives to extinguish any
obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder.
this form of settlement is commonly referred to as a "buy-back" of policies for future environmental liability. in addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation
which the company may have for other claims, including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. the company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish
any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. where appropriate, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the company. the company's general
purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs.
in
establishing environmental reserves, the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. in the course of this analysis,
the company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. in addition, the company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature
of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the
corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between
the company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other
available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in
each jurisdiction. the evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. conventional
actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves.
in
its review of environmental reserves, the company considers: past settlement payments; changing judicial and legislative trends; its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental
coverage matters; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up actions for both on-and off-site waste disposal activities; the potential for adverse
development; the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements.
the
duration of the company's investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the
company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. these factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of
underlying litigation or claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the company and the willingness of the policyholder and the company to negotiate, if appropriate,
a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and policyholder-by-policyholder, the company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration
of an environmental claim. however, based upon the company's experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several years.
table of contents
the company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980's. these
policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are
willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. over the past several years, the company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new
policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. however, the degree to which those
favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated. in addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims has been greater than anticipated. as a result of these factors, in
2014, 2013 and 2012, the company increased its net environmental reserves by $87million, $65million and $90million, respectively.
net
environmental paid loss and loss expenses were $84million in each of the years 2014, 2013 and 2012. at december31, 2014, approximately 92% of the net environmental
reserve (approximately $318million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of
coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims. the bulk reserve the company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the
company's experience in resolving those claims. the balance, approximately 8% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $28million), consists of case reserves.

uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves
as a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and
environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. however, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue,
and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes
available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy
protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond
that which is anticipated, the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements,
the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a
manner inconsistent with the company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the company, future developments pertaining to the company's ability to
recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or
through the insolvency of other participating insurers. in addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. it is also not possible to predict
changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. this environment could be affected by changes in
applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for
the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are
resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other
parties and require court approval to be effective. as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the company continues to study the implications of these and other
developments.
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the company's current reserves. in addition, the company's estimate of claims and
claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that
could be material to the company's operating results in future periods.
investment portfolio
the company's invested assets at december31, 2014 were $73.26billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and
short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 5% in other investments. because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments,
the company employs a conservative investment philosophy. a significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable u.s.
government, tax-exempt u.s. municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds.
the
carrying value of the company's fixed maturity portfolio at december31, 2014 was $63.47billion. the company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity
investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the company's insurance and debt obligations. the weighted average credit

obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions
the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2014 and 2013 included $33.57billion and
$35.56billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). the municipal
bond portfolio is diversified across the united states, the district of columbia and puerto rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts
and similar issuers. included in the municipal bond portfolio at december31, 2014 and 2013 were $7.56billion and $9.52billion, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are
bonds for which states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of u.s. treasury securities, which were created to satisfy their responsibility for payments
of principal and interest. the irrevocable trusts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the underwriter, issuer or trustee.

issuer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of issuer default.
the
company bases its investment decision on the underlying credit characteristics of the municipal security. while its municipal bond portfolio includes a number of securities that were
enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default, the company does not rely on enhanced credit characteristics provided by such third-party
insurance as part of its investing decisions. of the insured municipal securities in the company's investment portfolio at december31, 2014, approximately 100% were rated at "a3" or above, and
approximately 88% were rated at "aa3" or above, without the benefit of insurance. the company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the
company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities, as well as the company's ability and intent to hold the
securities. the average credit rating of the underlying issuers of these securities was "aa2" at december31, 2014. the average credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was "aa1" at
december31, 2014, with and without the enhancement provided by third-party insurance.

using external rating agencies or by the company when a public rating does not exist. the table includes $554million of short-term securities
which have the highest ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. for purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated "a-1+" and/or "p-1," are included as
"aaa" rated securities.
in
addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the company has exposure totaling $214million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships
(both of which are included in other investments in the company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across europe. the company has unfunded commitments totaling
$136million to these partnerships. the company also has $5million of nonredeemable preferred stock (included in equity securities on the company's consolidated balance sheet) issued by
companies in the eurozone.
mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities
the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2014 and 2013 included $2.21billion and
$2.42billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (cmo), all of which are subject to prepayment
risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). while prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the
company's investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. included in the totals at december31, 2014 and 2013 were
$872million and $1.07billion, respectively, of gnma, fnma, fhlmc (excluding fha project loans) and canadian government guaranteed residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities
classified as available for sale. also included in those totals were residential cmos classified as available for sale with a fair value of $1.34billion and $1.36billion at
december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. approximately 46% and 42% of the company's cmo holdings at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were
table of contents
guaranteed
by or fully collateralized by securities issued by gnma, fnma or fhlmc. the average credit rating of the $725million and $790million of non-guaranteed cmo holdings at
december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was "ba1" and "ba3," respectively. the average credit rating of all of the above securities was "aa3" and "a1" at december31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.
the
company makes investments in residential cmos that are either guaranteed by gnma, fnma or fhlmc, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective
securitizations. both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential cmos allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. in addition,
non-guaranteed residential cmos provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders. senior and super-senior cmos are protected, to varying degrees, from
credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. the company's investment strategy is to purchase cmo tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return
given the company's assessment of associated risks. the company does not purchase residual interests in cmos.
alternative documentation mortgages and sub-prime mortgages
at december31, 2014 and 2013, the company's fixed maturity investment portfolio included cmos backed by alternative
documentation mortgages and asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a collective fair value of $252million and $293million, respectively (comprising less
than 1% of the company's total fixed maturity investments at both dates). the company defines sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or
more of the following characteristics: low fico scores, above-prime interest rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. alternative documentation securitizations are those in
which the underlying loans primarily meet the government-sponsored entities' requirements for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entities' guidelines for documentation, property
type, debt and loan-to-value ratios. the average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the company was"ba2" at both december31, 2014 and 2013. the company does not believe
this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size.
commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans
at december31, 2014 and 2013, the company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including fha project loans) of
$715million and $475million, respectively. the average credit rating on these securities held by the company was "aaa" at both december31, 2014 and 2013. the company does not
believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size and the underlying credit
strength of these securities.
equity securities available for sale, real estate and short-term investments
see note1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset
classes.
other investments
the company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and
real estate partnerships and joint ventures. these asset classes have historically provided a higher return than the company's fixed maturity investments but are subject to more volatility. at
december31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of the company's other investments was $3.59billion and $3.44billion, respectively.
table of contents
securities lending
the company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its
investments to other institutions for short periods of time. at december31, 2014 and 2013, the company had $296million and $131million of securities on loan, respectively, as
part of a tri-party lending agreement. the average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2014 and 2013 was $228million and $168million, respectively. borrowers of these
securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest. the company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities lending
program for the years ended december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
lloyd's trust deposit
the company utilizes a lloyd's trust deposit, whereby owned securities with a fair value of approximately $151million and
$181million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were pledged into a lloyd's trust account to provide a portion of the capital needed to
support the company's obligations at lloyd's.

catastrophe modeling
the company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to analyze
catastrophic events and the risks associated with them. the company uses these analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic
events. there are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.
the
company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling
processes. the company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors to account for
non-modeled losses to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. these proprietary models are continually updated as new information emerges.
the
tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses), from
a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars and as a percentage of the company's common equity), based on the current version
of the proprietary and third-party computer models utilized by the company at december31, 2014. for example, on the basis described below the tables, the company estimates that there is a one
percent chance that the company's loss from a single u.s. hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $1.3billion, or 6% of the company's common equity at december31, 2014.

(1)an
event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a "1-in-50year event." as noted above, however, the
probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe.
also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not
address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe.
table of contents
(2)the
percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a)indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b)total common equity excluding net
unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes. net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily
indicative of operating trends. accordingly, the company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane
or single earthquake on the company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.
the
threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the company's in-force portfolio at december31, 2014 and catastrophic reinsurance program at january1,
2015, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. for further information regarding the company's
reinsurance, see "item1reinsurance." the amounts for hurricanes reflect u.s. exposures and include
property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures. the hurricane loss amounts are based on the company's catastrophe risk model estimates and
include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge. the amounts for earthquakes reflect u.s. and canadian property and workers' compensation exposures. the company does not believe that
the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.
catastrophe
modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. these inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may
result in volatility in the modeled output. catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. catastrophe
modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. consequently, catastrophe
modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. in the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of
exceedance decreases. in other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. actual losses from an event
could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. in addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.
moreover,
the company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed
to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other
naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber-risk.
for
more information about the company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see "item1arisk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect
our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and
"item1arisk factorswe may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results."
changing climate conditions
severe weather events over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created
uncertainty regarding insurers' exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophes and other weather-related events. for example, over the last decade hurricane activity has impacted areas
further inland than previously experienced by the company, thus expanding the company's potential for losses from hurricanes. additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms
in the united states have been more volatile in recent years, while any further
table of contents
reductions
in arctic sea ice may contribute to rising sea levels that could impact flooding in coastal areas. accordingly, the company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other
weather-related events. additionally, the company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability, frequency and severity of severe weather events or a delay in the
recognition of recent changes in climate conditions.
the
company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under "risk factors" in item1a of this report and under
"outlook" herein. for example, among other things:
increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies
issued by the company. see "risk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely
impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and "outlookunderwriting gain/loss."
changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the company invests. for example,
water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers in the southwestern united states, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in
the southeastern united states, among other areas. see "risk factorsour investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses."
increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the company and its customers. for
example, state insurance regulation could impact the company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. if the company is unable to implement risk
based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur),
its business may be adversely affected. see "risk factorscatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and
could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance."
the full range of potential liability exposures related to climate change continues to evolve. through the company's emerging issues
committee and its committee on climate, energy and the environment, the company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related
liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. see "risk factorsthe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain."
climate
change regulation also could increase the company's customers' costs of doing business. for example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less
available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. also, increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity, which would
decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses.
the
company regularly reviews emerging issues, such as changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help
determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products.

make the required annuity payments, the company would be required to make such payments. the following table presents the company's top five groups by structured settlements at december31,

the
company considers the ratings and related outlook assigned to reinsurance companies and life insurance companies by various independent ratings agencies in assessing the adequacy of
its allowance for uncollectible amounts.
outlook
the following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the company's results of operations and capital
position.
premiums.the company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. net written premiums comprise both renewal
business and new
business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. when business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease
(renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles
or properties insured). net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions,
which, particularly in the case of the business and international insurance segment, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. net written premiums are also
impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs.
overall,
the company expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong. in the business and
international insurance segment, the company expects that renewal premium changes during 2015 will remain positive, driven by both positive renewal rate changes and, subject to the economic
uncertainties discussed below, growth in insured exposures, but will be lower than the levels attained in 2014. in the bond& specialty insurance segment, the company expects that renewal
premium changes during 2015 will be broadly consistent with 2014. with respect to surety, the company expects net written premium volume in 2015 that is broadly consistent with the levels attained in
2014. in the personal insurance segment, the company expects both agency automobile and agency homeowners and other renewal premium changes during 2015 will remain positive, driven by both positive
renewal rate changes (based on the company's actions to file for rate increases) and, subject to the economic uncertainties discussed below, growth in insured exposures, but will be lower than the
levels attained in 2014. the
table of contents
need
for state regulatory approval for changes to personal property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium
changes.
property
and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2015 for new business, not only in business and international insurance and bond&
specialty insurance, but especially in personal insurance, where price comparison technology used by agents and brokers, sometimes referred to as "comparative raters," has facilitated the process of
generating multiple quotes, thereby increasing price comparison on new business and, increasingly, on renewal business. the company anticipates that its new quantum auto 2.0 product in the personal
insurance segment's agency automobile line of business, as discussed below, will continue to increase new business premiums during 2015. the company also anticipates that, as a result of strong
business retentions and increases in new business, policies in force in the personal insurance segment's agency automobile line of business will continue to increase in 2015. in each of the company's
business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business. however, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, the impact of a higher
mix of new business versus renewal business may negatively impact underwriting profitability.
in
recent years, the federal government, particularly the federal reserve, has taken extraordinary steps to stabilize financial markets, encourage economic growth and keep interest rates
low. during this time, the united states has experienced a slow rate of economic growth. even if economic growth continues in the united states, or other regions in which we do business, it may be at
a slow or slower rate for an extended period of time. further, general uncertainty regarding a variety of domestic and international matters, such as the u.s. federal budget and taxes, implementation
of the affordable care act, the regulatory environment and geopolitical instability in various parts of the world, has added to the uncertainty regarding economic conditions generally. if economic
conditions deteriorate, the resulting low levels of economic activity could impact exposure changes at renewal and the company's ability to write business at acceptable rates. additionally, low levels
of economic activity could adversely impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. all of the foregoing, in turn, could adversely impact
net written premiums during 2015, and because earned premiums are a function of net written premiums, earned premiums could be adversely impacted in 2015.
underwriting gain/loss.the company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or
unfavorable
prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins.
catastrophe
and other weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. the company experienced significant catastrophe and other weather-related losses in a
number of recent periods, which adversely impacted its results of operations. the company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and other weather-related
losses were to occur during 2015.
for
the last several years, the company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development, although at lower levels in some recent periods,
driven by better than expected loss experience in all of the company's segments. the lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development in a number of recent periods may have been in part due
to the company's reserve estimation process incorporating those factors that led to the higher levels of net favorable prior year reserve development in previous years. if that trend continues, the
better than expected loss experience may continue at these recent lower levels, or even lower levels. however, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves, loss experience could develop such that the company recognizes higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable
prior year reserve development in future periods. in addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or
table of contents
other
changes in current period circumstances, may result in the company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.
it
is possible that the steps taken by the federal government, particularly the federal reserve, to stabilize financial markets and improve economic conditions could lead to higher
inflation than the company had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase in the company's loss costs. the impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines of
business that are considered "long tail", such as general liability, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. for a further discussion,
see "partiitem1arisk factorsif actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected."
in
business and international insurance, the company expects underlying underwriting margins during 2015 that will be modestly higher than in 2014. in making this comparison, the company
has assumed that non-catastrophe weather-related losses and what the company defines as large losses will be at lower levels than what the company experienced in 2014, particularly in the second half
of that year.
in
bond& specialty insurance, the company expects underlying underwriting margins during 2015 that will be broadly consistent with those in 2014.
in
personal insurance, the company anticipates underlying underwriting margins in 2015 will be lower than in 2014. in agency automobile, the company expects underlying underwriting
margins in 2015 that will be slightly lower than in 2014 due to the impact of an expected higher mix of new business versus renewal business. in agency homeowners and other, the company anticipates
underlying underwriting margins in 2015 that will be lower than in 2014, reflecting normalized levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses. also in personal insurance, the company's direct to
consumer initiative, the distribution channel that the company launched in 2009, while intended to enhance the company's long-term ability to compete successfully in a consumer-driven marketplace, is
expected to remain modest with respect to premium volume and remain unprofitable for a number of years as this book of business grows and matures.
the
agency automobile line of business has been negatively impacted by various factors, including the use of price comparison technology by agents and brokers as discussed above. the
company's actions in response to these factors have included, among other things, the reduction of certain claim adjustment and other insurance expenses, with the majority of the impact in the agency
automobile line of business. at december31, 2014, these actions to reduce costs have resulted in an expected annual decrease of $140million in pre-tax expenses in 2015 when compared
with expense levels prior to their implementation. additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2013, the company launched its newest private passenger automobile product, quantum auto 2.0. this product, in
addition to incorporating the cost savings described above, has a lower base commission rate than the company's existing quantum auto 1.0 product. these changes in cost structure enabled the company
to price quantum auto 2.0 more competitively while maintaining expected returns at appropriate levels. by december31, 2014, the company offered quantum auto 2.0 in approximately 90% of the
states where it plans to offer the product, and the company currently expects that, by the end of 2015, it will offer the product in all of those states. the company intends that, in approved states,
all new accounts will be written using quantum auto 2.0. in addition, quantum auto 2.0 is available to agents at their discretion for existing accounts.
investment portfolio.the company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment
portfolio and a
relatively short average effective duration. the average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 3.5 (3.7 excluding short-term securities) at december31, 2014.
from time to time, the company enters into short positions in
table of contents
u.s.treasury
futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. at december31, 2014, the company had $350million notional value of open u.s. treasury
futures contracts. the
company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. currently, the majority of the company's investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid taxable
u.s. government, tax-exempt u.s. municipal and taxable corporate and u.s. agency mortgage-backed bonds.
the
company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. these
investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.
net
investment income is a material contributor to the company's results of operations. interest rates remain at very low levels by historical standards. based on the current interest
rate environment, the company estimates that the impact of lower reinvestment yields on the company's fixed maturity portfolio could, for 2015, result in approximately $25million of lower
after-tax net investment income from that portfolio on a quarterly basis as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2014. given recent general economic and investment market conditions, the company
expects investment income from the non-fixed maturity portfolio during 2015 will be lower than in 2014. if general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions deteriorate during 2015, the
company could also experience a further reduction in net investment income and/or significant realized investment losses, including impairments.
the
company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment gain of $2.67billion ($1.75billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at december31, 2014.
while the company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce
shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects.

entitled "we are subject to a number of risks associated with our business outside the united states" and see "partiitem7aquantitative and qualitative
disclosure about market riskforeign currency exchange rate risk."
capital position.the company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value,
expects to
continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders. the company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and
common share repurchases will likely not exceed operating
income. in addition, the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of additional factors, including the company's financial position, earnings, share
price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the company's qualified pension plan, capital
requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market
conditions and other factors. for information regarding the company's common share repurchases in 2014, see "liquidity and capital resources."

liquidity and capital resources
liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business
operations and to satisfy general corporate purposes when needed.
operating company liquidity.the liquidity requirements of the company's insurance subsidiaries are met primarily by funds generated
from premiums,
fees, income received on investments and investment maturities. cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. the
insurance subsidiaries' liquidity requirements can be impacted by, among other factors, the timing and amount of catastrophe claims, which are inherently unpredictable, as well as the timing and
amount of reinsurance recoveries, which may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes. additionally, the variability of asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the
volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. it is the opinion of the company's management that the insurance
subsidiaries' future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the sources described above. subject to restrictions imposed by states in which the company's insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled, the company's principal insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to their respective parent companies, which in turn pay dividends to the corporate holding (parent) company (trv). for further
information regarding restrictions on dividends paid by the company's insurance subsidiaries, see "partiitem1regulation."
holding company liquidity.trv's liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt servicing, common share
repurchases and, from
time to time, contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. at december31, 2014, trv held total cash and short-term invested assets in the united states aggregating
$1.59billion and having a weighted average maturity of 56days. these assets are sufficient to meet trv's current liquidity requirements and are in excess of trv's minimum target level,
which comprises trv's estimated annual pretax interest expense and common shareholder dividends, and currently totals approximately $1.1billion.
trv
is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. u.s. income taxes have not been recognized on
$647million of the company's foreign operations' undistributed earnings as of december31, 2014, as such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations.
furthermore, taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits against the u.s. tax on dividend distributions if such earnings were to be distributed to the holding company.
the amount of undistributed earnings from foreign operations and related taxes on those undistributed earnings were not material to the company's financial position or liquidity at december31,
2014.
trv
has a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which permits it to issue securities from time to time. trv also has a $1.0billion line of
credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in june 2018. this line of credit also supports trv's $800million commercial paper program, of which $100million
was outstanding at december31, 2014. trv is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs.
table of contents
the
company utilized uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately $118million, to provide a portion of the capital needed to
support its obligations at lloyd's at december31, 2014. if uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the company can collateralize
these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at lloyd's, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand.
operating activities
net cash flows provided by operating activities were $3.69billion, $3.82billion and $3.23billion in 2014, 2013
and 2012, respectively. cash flows in 2014 primarily reflected higher levels of payments for claims and claim adjustment expenses, general and administrative expenses and commission expenses, as well
as higher income tax payments, partially offset by higher levels of collected premiums. these increases included the impact of the company's acquisition of dominion. cash flows in 2013 primarily
reflected a decrease in losses paid related to catastrophes and a higher level of collected premiums, partially offset by an increase in income tax payments. cash flows in 2012 primarily reflected a
decrease in losses paid related to catastrophes, a lower level of paid losses related to asbestos claims and operations in runoff and a higher level of collected premiums, partially offset by an
increase in paid losses related to non-catastrophe ongoing business (including the impact of increased loss costs). in 2014 and 2012, the company voluntarily made contributions totaling
$200million and $217million, respectively, to its qualified domestic pension plan. in 2013, the company made no contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. the qualified
domestic pension plan was 96% and 106% funded at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
investing activities
net cash flows provided by investing activities in 2014 were $206million, compared with net cash flows used in investing
activities of $910million and $972million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the 2013 total included $997million related to the company's acquisition of dominion (net of cash
acquired). the company's consolidated total investments at december31, 2014 increased by $101million, or less than 1% over year-end 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of net cash
flows provided by operating activities and an increase in net unrealized appreciation of
investments, largely offset by common share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders. the company's consolidated total investments at december31, 2013 decreased by $678million,
or 1% over year-end 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of a significant decline in net unrealized appreciation of investments driven by an increase in interest rates, common share repurchases and
dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by net cash flows provided by operating activities and the acquisition of dominion.
on
december5, 2012, the company increased its ownership in j. malucelli participaes em seguros e resseguros s.a, its brazilian joint venture
(jmalucelli), through the exercise of a pre-existing option. as a result, the company increased its ownership to 49.5% of the venture. jmalucelli is currently the market leader in surety in brazil
based on market share. the company's investment was funded with cash provided internally from an operating subsidiary of the company.
the
company's investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly, the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders. as such, the primary
goals of the company's asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. generally,
the expected principal and interest payments produced by the company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company's insurance reserves. although this is not an exact
cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow
from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit
facilities.
table of contents
financing activities
net cash flows used in financing activities were $3.81billion, $2.94billion and $2.15billion in 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively. the totals in each year primarily reflected common share repurchases and dividends to shareholders, partially offset by the proceeds from employee stock option exercises. the total
in 2013 also included the issuance of 4.60% senior notes for net proceeds of $494million and the payment of the company's $500million, 5.00% senior notes at maturity. common share
repurchases in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $3.33billion, $2.46billion and $1.53billion, respectively.
debt transactions.
2013.on july25, 2013, the company issued $500million aggregate principal amount of 4.60% senior notes that will mature on
august1, 2043. the net proceeds of the issuance, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, totaled approximately
$494million. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on february1 and august1, commencing on february1, 2014. the senior notes are redeemable
in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a)100% of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or
(b)the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption)
discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current treasury rate (as defined) plus 15 basis points.
on
march15, 2013, the company's $500million, 5.00% senior notes matured and were fully paid.
2012.on may29, 2012, the company purchased and retired $8.5million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25%
fixed-to-floating rate
junior subordinated debentures due march15, 2067 in an open market transaction. the company's $250million, 5.375% senior notes matured on june15, 2012 and were paid from
existing holding company liquidity.
in
2015, the amount of debt obligations, other than commercial paper, that comes due is $400million. the company may refinance maturing debt through funds generated internally
or, depending on market conditions, through funds generated externally, including as a result of the issuance of debt or other securities.
dividends.dividends paid to shareholders were $729million, $729million and $694million in 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.
the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the company's common stock will be at the discretion of the company's board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including the
company's financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems
relevant. dividends will be paid by the company only if declared by its board
of directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the company. on january22, 2015, the company announced that it declared a regular
quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, payable march31, 2015, to shareholders of record on march10, 2015.
share repurchases.the company's board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be
made from time
to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of rule10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. the
authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the company's financial
position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the company's qualified
pension plan, capital requirements of the company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and

from
the inception of the first authorization on may2, 2006 through december31, 2014, the company has repurchased a cumulative total of 425.9million shares for a
total cost of $24.52billion, or an average of $57.56 per share.
in
2014, 2013 and 2012, the company acquired 0.7million, 0.8million and 0.9million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock
primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options.
2014 stock incentive plan.in february 2014, the company's board of directors approved the travelers companies,inc. 2014 stock
incentive plan
(the 2014 incentive plan) to replace, effective with shareholder approval, the amended and restated 2004 stock incentive plan (the 2004 incentive plan), which was scheduled to expire in july 2014. at
the company's 2014 annual meeting of shareholders on may27, 2014, the shareholders approved the 2014 incentive plan. accordingly, the 2014 incentive plan became effective on that date, and no
further awards will be made under the 2004 incentive plan. the 2014 incentive plan has substantially the same terms, other than the number of shares available, as the 2004 incentive plan and is
effective through february5, 2024. the number of shares initially
available for issuance under the 2014 incentive plan was 10,000,000 shares of common stock. shares of common stock subject to awards granted under the 2014 incentive plan or the prior 2004 incentive
plan that (i)expire unexercised, (ii)are forfeited, terminated or canceled, (iii)are settled in cash or other forms of property, or (iv)otherwise do not result in the
issuance of shares of common stock, will be available for grant under the 2014 incentive plan.
capital resources
capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise
new capital to meet its needs. the following table summarizes the components of the company's capital structure at december31, 2014 and 2013.

the

opinion of the company's management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the company's financial leverage position. the
company's ratio of debt-to-total capital (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains) of 21.7% at december31, 2014 was within the company's target range of 15% to 25%.
credit agreement.the company is a party to a five-year, $1.0billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial
institutions
that expires in june 2018. terms of the credit agreement are discussed in more detail in note8 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
shelf registration.the company has filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement for the
potential
offering and sale of securities. the company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering.
share repurchase authorization.at december31, 2014, the company had $1.48billion of capacity remaining under its share
repurchase
authorization approved by the board of directors.
contractual obligations
the following table summarizes, as of december31, 2014, the company's future payments under contractual obligations and
estimated claims and claim-related payments. the table excludes short-term liabilities and includes only obligations at december31, 2014 that are expected to be settled in cash.
the
table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related payments. the amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates,
generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques, at a given accounting date. these estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on
the company's assessment of facts and circumstances known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors.
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends and
legislative changes. many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. additionally, there may
table of contents
be
significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. the future cash flows related to the items contained in the table
below required estimation of both amount (including severity considerations) and timing. amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. an estimation of both amount and timing of future cash
flows related to claims and claim-related payments has unavoidable estimation uncertainty.

(6)the
amounts in "claims and claim adjustment expenses" in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported
claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses, gross of reinsurance recoverables, excluding structured settlements expected to be paid by annuity companies.
the
company has entered into reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to losses and protect its capital as described in note5 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
in
order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e.,the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk. since the
timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are
recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts. the presence of any feature
that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance. the assumptions used in estimating the amount
and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities.
the
estimated future cash inflows from the company's reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows:

the
amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. accordingly,
the amounts above will differ from the company's balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted
in the balance sheet. (see note1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.)
table of contents
(7)workers'
compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under
such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. "claims from large deductible policies" represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related
expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. the liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance
sheet as "contractholder payables" and "contractholder receivables," respectively. most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder's escrow which is periodically replenished
by the policyholder. the payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within "claims and claim adjustment expenses" in the above table. because the timing of the collection of the
deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table.
the
estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers' compensation policies is presented below:

(8)the
amounts in "loss-based assessments" relate to estimated future payments of second-injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current
claim liabilities. second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition. for loss-based assessments, the cost is shared by the insurance industry
and self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on losses. amounts relating to second-injury fund assessments are included in "other liabilities" in the
consolidated balance sheet.
(9)the
amounts in "payout from ceded funds withheld" represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance
arrangements whereby the company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held.
(10)the
company's current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are $628million. offsetting these liabilities
are deferred tax assets of $588million associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized.
the
above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event
of default by the company issuing the annuity. the company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements. in addition, the company is not currently
subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan. accordingly, future contributions are not included in the foregoing table.
dividend availability
the company's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the state of connecticut. the insurance holding company laws of
connecticut applicable to the company's subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other
distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer's statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding december31, or the insurer's net income for
the twelve-month period ending the preceding december31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. this declaration or payment is
further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. the insurance holding company laws of other states in which the company's subsidiaries
are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat
table of contents
more
restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. a maximum of $3.25billion is available by the end of 2015 for such dividends to the holding company, trv, without prior approval of
the connecticut insurance department. the company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2015 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2015, which could result in
certain dividends being subject to approval by the connecticut insurance department.
in
addition to the regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that can be paid by the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be
paid to the company's shareholders is limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the company to
maintain a minimum consolidated net worth as described in note8 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements.
trv
is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. the undistributed earnings of the company's foreign
operations are not material and are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations.
trv
and its two non-insurance holding company subsidiaries received $4.10billion of dividends in 2014 from their u.s. insurance subsidiaries.
pension and other postretirement benefit plans
the company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the qualified plan), which covers substantially all
u.s. domestic employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula. in addition, the company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain
highly-compensated employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service
requirements and for certain retirees.
the
qualified plan is subject to regulations under the employee retirement income act of 1974 as amended (erisa), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and requires
such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the pension benefit guaranty corporation (pbgc). the company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the qualified plan for 2015
and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2016. the company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements.
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, there was no minimum funding requirement for the qualified plan. in 2014 and 2012, the company voluntarily made contributions totaling $200million and
$217million, respectively, to the qualified plan. in determining future contributions, the company will consider the performance of the plan's investment portfolio, the effects of interest
rates on the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the company's other capital requirements. the company has not determined whether or not additional voluntary funding will be made in the 2015.
however, the company currently believes, subject to actual plan performance and funded status at the time, that it may make voluntary pension contributions of approximately $75million to
$100million annually beginning in 2015 as well as over the following several years.
at
december31, 2014, the company updated its mortality assumptions for estimating its qualified pension plan liabilities utilizing a new mortality table and related improvement
scale issued by the society of actuaries in october 2014. the adoption of the new mortality table and related improvement scale increased the projected benefit obligation by $150million at
december31, 2014.
table of contents
the qualified plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return while maintaining an appropriate level of risk. the company's overall strategy is to
achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers.
the current target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. for 2015, the company
plans to apply an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.25%, down from 7.50% in 2014. the expected rate of return reflects the company's current expectations with regard to long-term
returns on the qualified plan's invested assets, taking into account the current valuation of u.s. equities, the 75% increase in the s&p500 index over the past three years and the current low
level of long-term interest rates which, according to the federal reserve's commentary in december 2014, are expected to remain at their current low level until its objectives of maximum employment
and 2% inflation are achieved. the company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets also contemplates a return to more normal levels of long-term interest rates in the future.

further discussion of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see note14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
risk-based capital
the naic has an rbc requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies, which determines minimum capital requirements and
is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these naic rbc requirements based on laws that have been adopted by
individual states. these requirements subject insurers having policyholders' surplus less than that required by the rbc calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of
capital inadequacy. each of the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders' surplus at december31, 2014 significantly above the level at which any rbc regulatory action would
occur. regulators in the jurisdictions in which the company's foreign insurance subsidiaries are located require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other
things, the type and amount of insurance policies in force. each of the company's foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at
december31, 2014.
off-balance sheet arrangements
the company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to selling businesses to third parties, certain
investments, third-party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications. see note16 of notes to
the company's consolidated financial statements. the company does not expect these arrangements will have a material effect on the company's financial position, changes in financial position, revenues
and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
critical accounting estimates
the company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and
related reinsurance recoverables, investment valuation and impairments, and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments.

the
$1.05billion decrease in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since december31, 2013 primarily reflected the impact of favorable prior year reserve
development, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and payments related to operations in runoff.
asbestos
and environmental reserves are included in the general liability, commercial multi-peril and international and other lines in the foregoing summary table. asbestos and
environmental reserves are
discussed separately; see "asbestos claims and litigation", "environmental claims and litigation" and "uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves."
claims
and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims
that have been incurred but not yet reported (ibnr). claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates,
generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date. these estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost
upon final resolution in the future, based on the company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and
frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. in establishing gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, the company also considers salvage and
subrogation. estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in "reinsurance recoverables" as an asset on the company's consolidated balance sheet. the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company.
the
process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. these variables can be affected by both
internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative
changes, among others. the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. estimation difficulties also differ significantly by
product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time
between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). informed judgment is applied throughout the
table of contents
process,
including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. the company continually refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as
historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. the company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves are established. due to the inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the
estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. therefore, actual paid losses,
as claims are settled in the future, may be materially different than the amount currently recordedfavorable or unfavorable.
because
establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves may
change. the company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.
there
are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes and other
catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and
regulatory uncertainties, including the interpretation of policy terms and conditions, and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. complex factors include, but are not
limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand
surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. the timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a
reporting period, can also affect the information available to the company in estimating reserves for that reporting period. the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.
a
portion of the company's gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $2.87billion at december31, 2014) are for asbestos and environmental claims and
related litigation. while the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded
theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the company's management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties
regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the company's future operating results. see the preceding
discussion of "asbestos claims and litigation" and "environmental claims and litigation."
general discussion
the process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim
data. data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated
by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line. such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. the process of analyzing
reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information.
multiple
estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and
disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. the relative
strengths and
table of contents
weaknesses
of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each
evaluation. the estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated.
in
most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. this will result in a range of reasonable
estimates for any particular claim liability. the company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable, given
subsequent information. reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. these reviews may substantiate the validity of
management's recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate.
the
exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for
an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. as a result, the company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. in
addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process.
property-casualty
insurance policies are either written on a claims-made or on an occurrence basis. claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual policies,
claims reported during the policy period. policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports
the loss many years later.
most
general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. these policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years
following the policy issuance. the occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction
general liability, including construction defect. occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends, including future inflation,
judicial interpretations and societal litigation trends (e.g.,size of jury awards and propensity of individuals to pursue litigation), among others.
a
basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors
discussed below. to the
extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if available and when
appropriate, external data. such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. significant structural changes to the
available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process.
informed
judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. this includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. in
addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. therefore, management may have to
consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. it is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger,
consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult.
the
variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the
reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line.
table of contents
product
lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final
resolution of those claims. short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. the longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to
estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty.
a
major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. the reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes
estimating ibnr inherently more uncertain. in addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of ibnr to the total claim liability for the product line. writing new products with
material reporting lags can result in adding several years' worth of ibnr claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with
pricing and reserving such products. the most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims.
for
some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. these lines are generally referred to as being "low frequency/high severity," while lines without
this "large claim" sensitivity are referred to as "high frequency/low severity." estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number
of potentially large claims. as a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. in contrast, for
high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is likely narrower and more stable.
claim
complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and
claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater
estimation uncertainty.
actuaries
have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. the human element in the application of actuarial
judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional
experiences and areas of focus. hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other.
lastly,
significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. events such as mergers increase the
inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization.
risk factors
the major causes of material uncertainty ("risk factors") generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately
analyzed component of the product line. in a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. for example, a method may explicitly
assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. actual results will
likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently.
some
risk factors will affect more than one product line. examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions,
court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line.
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components.
table of contents
the
effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. for example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the
risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors.
the
evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. for example, the timing of claims payments in one
geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region.
while
some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more
evolutionary. evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. the final
impact is not known until all steps have occurred.
sudden
changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. evolutionary changes generally
cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable.
actuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment
expense reserves
the principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the company's actuaries to evaluate management's existing estimates for prior
accident periods are the paid development method, the case incurred development method, the bornhuetter-ferguson (bf) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development
method. the bf method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible. these
are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods. (see glossary for an explanation of these methods).
while
these are the principal methods utilized throughout the company, actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods
developed within the casualty actuarial profession. the company's actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of
new techniques that might improve current and future estimates.
some
components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component. in such cases, the
company's actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims. the reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described
above. the reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods, such as:
estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods, adjusted for
the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available.
utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of
such claim adjuster estimates. (this monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates.)
utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate
small claims from conventional analysis.
ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental).
table of contents
the results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including paid-to-incurred loss ratios, implied
incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios and non-zero claim severity trends. an actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development embedded
within management's best estimate. additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods.
the
methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management's existing estimate for prior accident periods. for the initial estimate of the current accident year, the
available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. hence, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method, which uses the
earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio. the projected loss ratio is determined through an analysis of prior periods' experience, using loss trend, rate level
differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years. the exact number of prior accident years utilized
varies by product line component, based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate.
management's estimates
at least once per quarter, certain members of company management meet with the company's actuaries to review the latest claims and
claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. in doing so, it must evaluate whether the
new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. for example, as described above, payments may have decreased
in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. the resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment
pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability.
such
an assessment requires considerable judgment. it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. even if a change
is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. the overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several
months to perform. this is because the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. it may also
include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. as a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected
in the company's estimated claim liabilities. the final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new
actionable information.
the
audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for providing oversight of reserving propriety, and annually reviews the process by which the company establishes reserves.
discussion of product lines
the following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. there are many additional risk factors
that may impact ultimate claim costs. each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves.
for example, in workers' compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs.
thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation.
in
order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over a one-year
period are
table of contents
provided
for the u.s. product lines. this information is provided for both the company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the
reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. these changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual statement data found in schedulep
of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, excluding
non-defense related claim adjustment expense. data presented for the company includes history for the entire travelers group (u.s. companies only), whether or not the individual subsidiaries were
originally part of the st.paul companies,inc. (spc) or tpc. this treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for
schedulep. comparable data for non-u.s. companies is not available.
general liability
general liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims
from a given accident year. the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self-insured
retentions. there are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year
closed within five to seven years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g.,a reporting lag of a decade or more for "construction defect" claims).
while
the majority of general liability coverages are written on an "occurrence" basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering directors and officers or professional
liability) are typically insured on a "claims-made" basis.
general
liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property
damage. bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder's legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as
negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. in some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a
function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant's private property arising from the
policyholder's legal obligation for non-intentional acts. in most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter.
in
addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. these exposures include asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect and large unique accounts that
would otherwise distort the analysis. these unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods.
defense
costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. for some products this
risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs is included in the policy limit available to pay the claim. such "defense within the limits" policies are most
common for "claims-made" products. when defense costs are outside of the policy limits, the full amount of the policy limit is available to pay claims and the amounts paid for defense costs have no
contractual limit.
this
line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the united states (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). major contributors to
this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e.,the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties
involved in the underlying tort action, whether the "event" triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the
individual claim actions), whether such
table of contents
claims
were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e.,coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions. claims with
longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk. this is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple
policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement
complexity). claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e.,the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies
have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure).
the
amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. the components in this product line with the longest latency,
longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity
issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect and other mass
tort actions. many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. in
general, policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement
dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics.
in
addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development and s-curve methods for the
construction defect components of this product line. the construction defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for ibnr claim counts. for
components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the company relies more heavily on the bf method than on the paid and case incurred
development methods.

changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability
(excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from
8% to 2% (averaging 4%) for the company, and from 5% to 2% (averaging 3%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year
changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve
estimates for this product line. general liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 23% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, was 5% for 2014, 4% for 2013 and
3% for 2012. the 2014 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2008 through 2012, reflecting more favorable legal and judicial environments than what
the company previously expected. the 2013 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2010 and prior, reflecting more favorable legal and judicial environments than what
the company previously expected. the 2012 change was primarily concentrated in excess coverages for accident years 2009 and prior, reflecting more favorable legal and judicial environments than what
the company previously expected. also contributing to the 2012 change was better than expected results for management liability business, primarily for the errors& omissions and fiduciary
products for accident years 2007 and prior.
commercial property
commercial property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than
liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). it is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate
severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. the claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured
and the insurer. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims.
commercial
property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. examples of common risk
factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:
commercial property risk factors
physical concentration of policyholders
availability and cost of local contractors
table of contents
for the more severe catastrophic events, "demand surge" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building
material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services
local building codes
amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims)
frequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed
court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding)
lags in reporting claims (e.g.,winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or
equipment on roofs)
court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations
commercial property book of business risk factors
policy provisions mix (e.g.,deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)
changes in underwriting standards
unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1%
increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 25% to 5% (averaging
16%) for the company, and from 14% to 5% (averaging 9%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by,
and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this
product line. commercial property reserves represent approximately 3% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
since
commercial property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for commercial property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. this is due
to the fact that the majority of the reserve for commercial property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. this recent accident year
uncertainty is relevant to commercial property because of weather-related events which, notwithstanding 2013 and 2014 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally
are not completely resolved until the following year. reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. the reserve estimates for this product line are also
potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for significant catastrophes such as the events of september11, 2001, hurricane katrina and storm sandy.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 18% for 2014, 17% for 2013 and 22% for 2012. the 2014 change
primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2010 through 2013, including catastrophe losses from storm sandy for accident year 2012. the 2013 change primarily reflected
better than expected loss experience for accident years 2010 through 2012, driven by favorable loss development related to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses. the 2012 change primarily
reflected better than expected development for accident years 2009 through 2011, driven by favorable loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in 2011, and by higher subrogation and
salvage recoveries for accident years 2009 through 2011.

commercial multi-peril
commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore,
includes both short and long tail coverages. for property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability
coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims.
the
reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses. the reserving
risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. commercial multi-peril is generally sold to smaller-sized
accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and commercial property includes larger customers.
see
"commercial property risk factors" and "general liability risk factors," discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril.
unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial
multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 19% to 5% (averaging 4%) for
the company, and from 6% to 0% (averaging 3%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the
year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. commercial multi-peril reserves
(excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 7% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
as
discussed above, this line combines general liability and commercial property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 3% for 2014, 2% for 2013 and 1% for 2012. the 2014 change primarily reflected higher than expected
loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2010 through 2013. the 2013 change primarily
reflected higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2008 through 2011, driven by higher than expected severity and defense costs.
commercial automobile
the commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail
coverages. the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. the payments that take longer to finalize and are more
difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. in general, claim reporting lags are minor, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate
severity. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.
commercial
automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. these last two
components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented.
the
company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. this is supplemented with detailed custom
analyses where needed.

historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 10% to 7% (averaging 2%) for
the company, and from 3% to 3% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the

the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 2% for 2014, 1% for 2013 and 7% for 2012. the 2014 change reflected better than expected loss
experience for accident years
table of contents
and 2012. the 2012 change reflected higher than expected severity in the bodily injury coverage primarily for accident years 2010 and 2011.
workers' compensation
workers' compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims
from a given accident year. while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course
of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. in addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker's life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going medical
care. despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, settlements are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with
moderate severity. the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker's injury, as such claims
are subject to greater inflation risk. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk.
workers'
compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses.
examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers' compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:
indemnity risk factors
time required to recover from the injury
degree of available transitional jobs
degree of legal involvement
changes in the interpretations and processes of the administrative bodies that oversee workers' compensation claims
future wage inflation for states that index benefits
changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds
medical risk factors
changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules ("inflation")
frequency of visits to health providers
number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers
types of health providers used
type of medical treatments received
use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices

historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 2% to 1% (averaging 0%) for the company, and
from 2 to 2% (averaging 0%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes that
its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. workers' compensation reserves represent approximately 37% of the
company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 0% for 2014, 1% in 2013 and 2% in 2012. the 2012 change was primarily
driven by better than expected frequency and severity related to lifetime medical claims for accident years 2008 and prior.
fidelity and surety
fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. it takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle most fidelity
claims. the volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured's business operations, amount of policy limit and
attachment point of coverage. the uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. the high
frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates, whereas the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a
wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity claims.
surety
has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can
result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project(s) or commercial transaction being insured. (large construction projects can take many years to
complete.) the frequency of losses in surety generally correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured to fulfill its contractual obligations. the
company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through disciplined risk selection, adherence to underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring of contractor progress in significant
construction projects. the volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the
amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other
table of contents
security
positions of an insured's assets. certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. these can include large construction contractors involved with one or
multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due
the insured (e.g.,salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured.

fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 2% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
table of contents
in
general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 36% for 2014, 21% for 2013 and 8% for 2012. the 2014 change
reflected better than expected loss experience in the contract surety product line for accident years 2012 and prior. the 2013 change reflected better than expected loss experience in the contract
surety product line for accident years 2010 and prior. the 2012 change reflected better than expected loss experience in the contract surety product line for accident years 2008 and prior.
personal automobile
personal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical
damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. reporting lags are
relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. it is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to
moderate severity product line. overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.
personal
automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims.
these last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented.
examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve

historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from 7% to 3% (averaging 1%) for the
company, and from 4% to 1% (averaging 3%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed
events during the year. the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. personal
automobile reserves represent approximately 5% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 1% for 2014, 1% for 2013 and 2% for 2012. the 2012 change was primarily driven by higher than expected bodily injury
severity for accident year 2011.
homeowners and personal lines other
homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the
claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays
of several months are not unusual. the resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist.
the
liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags.
overall,
the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity.
homeowners
reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments.
examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section)

personal lines other, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves.
historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business, which for statutory reporting purposes is included with the
general liability line of business) over the last nine years has varied from 22% to 2% (averaging 11%) for the company, and from 7% to
2% (averaging 5%) for the industry overall. the company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. the company believes
that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent
approximately 2% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
this
line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. while property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year
change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year,
which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which, notwithstanding 2010 and 2011
experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take
even longer to resolve.
the
company's change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business) was 16% for 2014, 17% for 2013 and
11% for 2012. the 2014 change was primarily
table of contents
driven
by better than expected loss experience for non-catastrophe weather-related losses for accident year 2013 and for catastrophe losses for accident years 2011 through 2013. the 2013 change was
primarily driven by better than expected loss experience for catastrophe losses incurred in 2012 and non-catastrophe weather-related losses and non-weather-related losses for accident years 2012 and
2011. the 2012 change reflected better than expected loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in 2011 and non-catastrophe losses incurred in accident years 2010 and 2011.
international and other
international and other includes products written by the company's international operations, as well as all other products not
explicitly discussed above. the principal component of "other" claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non-u.s. exposures, and is
runoff business.
international
and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. the common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the
individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the u.s. statutory reporting framework.
due
to changes in the business mix for this line over time, including the recent acquisition of dominion, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively shorter tail (due to both
the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g.,canada, the republic of ireland and the united kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely
long tail (e.g.,u.s. excess liabilities reinsured through the london market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the
specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g.,underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g.,insured
and insurer located in different countries). in particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity,
due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes.
international
reserves are generally analyzed by country and general coverage category (e.g.,general liability in canada, commercial property in the united kingdom, etc.). the
business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage. where the underlying insured hazard is outside the united states, the underlying coverages are generally
similar to those described under the homeowners, personal automobile, commercial automobile, general liability, commercial property
and surety discussions above, taking into account differences in the legal environment and differences in terms and conditions. for example, in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy limits
on certain liability coverages.
other
reserves, primarily assumed reinsurance in runoff, are generally analyzed by program/pool, treaty type, and general coverage category (e.g.,general
liabilityexcess of loss reinsurance). excess exposure requires the insured to "prove" not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess
policy's attachment point.
examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required international and other reserves (beyond those included in the general
discussion section, and in the personal automobile, homeowners, general liability, commercial property, commercial automobile and surety discussions above) include:
international and other risk factors
changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers
changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision

changes in policy provisions (e.g.,deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, "claims-made" language)
changes in underwriting standards

unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for international and
other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves. international and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 9% of the company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.
international
and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff. comparative historical information is not available for international product
lines as insurers domiciled outside of the u.s. do not fileu.s. statutory reports. comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one-year
changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business. accordingly, the company has not included comparative analyses for international and other.
reinsurance recoverables
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. the company evaluates and
monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. in addition, in the ordinary
course of business, the company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to
determine the company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and
disputes.
the
company has entered into two reinsurance contracts in connection with catastrophe bonds issued by long point re iii. both of these contracts meet the requirements to be accounted for
as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. the catastrophe bonds are described in more detail in "item1businesscatastrophe
reinsurance."
table of contents
the company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. the allowance is based upon the
company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. accordingly, the
establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. from time to time, as a
result of the long-tailed nature of the underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, the company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts. changes in estimated
reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges.
recoverables
attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the
company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities. recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate
primarily to workers' compensation service business. these recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies' obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company's voluntary
market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. in the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool's or association's
obligations, the other members' share of such obligation increases proportionally.

investment valuation and impairments
fair value measurements
the company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair
value accounting guidance. the framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the
valuations when available. the disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. in
determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
that reflect the company's significant market assumptions. the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:
level1unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability to access.
level2quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g.,interest rates, yield
curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.
level3valuations based on models where significant inputs are not
observable. the unobservable inputs reflect the company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use.
valuation of investments reported at fair value in financial statements
the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction
between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e.,not in a
table of contents
forced
transaction. the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g.,a forced
transaction. additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair
value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.
for
investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in
level1 of the hierarchy. the company receives the quoted market prices from third party, nationally recognized pricing services. when quoted market prices are unavailable, the company utilizes
these pricing services to determine an estimate of fair value. the fair value estimates provided from these pricing services are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. if
quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the
level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as level2 or level3. the company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it
represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction.
fixed maturities
the company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities at both
december31, 2014 and 2013. the pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. since fixed maturities other than u.s.
treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which
include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. additionally, the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread
model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.
the
pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. the market inputs utilized
in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids,
offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. the extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions. depending on the security, the priority of
the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. for some securities, additional inputs may be necessary.
the
pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that it will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. if
the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to
make assumptions for any market-based inputs that were unavailable due to market conditions.
the
fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed
maturities, other than u.s. treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. the estimated fair value of u.s. treasury
securities is included in the amount disclosed in level1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.
the
company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the company's knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained
are representative of the prices in the market. in addition, the company has periodic discussions with the pricing service to discuss any changes in their process and reactions to overall markets. the
company
table of contents
produces
a report monthly that lists all price changes from the previous month in excess of 10%. the company reviews the report and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair
value. in addition, the company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing
service as well as reviewing reports that contain securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation (stale price review). the company also uses an additional independent pricing
service to further test the primary pricing service's valuation of the company's fixed maturity portfolio. these processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates
received from the pricing service.
the
company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and, accordingly, estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an
internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. the underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the u.s.
treasury curve are the bofa merrill lynch u.s. corporate index and the bofa merrill lynch high yield bb rated index. the company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in
level2, since all significant inputs are market observable.
while
the vast majority of the company's municipal bonds and corporate bonds are included in level2, the company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are
not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. due to the limited
amount of observable market information, the company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in level3. the fair value of the fixed maturities for which the company used
an internal pricing matrix was $92million and $94million at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. additionally, the company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity
investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. for these fixed maturities, the company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). the fair value
of the fixed maturities for which the company received a broker quote was $140million and $161million at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. due to the disclaimers on the
quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the company includes these fair value estimates in level3.
non-fixed maturities and other investments not reported at fair value
see note4 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the determination of fair value of
non-fixed maturities and valuation of investments not reported at fair value in the financial statements.
investment impairments
the company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary impairments. some of the
factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1)for fixed maturity investments, whether the company intends to sell the investment or whether it is more likely
than not that the company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2)for non-fixed maturity investments, the company's ability and intent to retain
the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3)the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity
securities (i.e.,whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4)the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed
maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5)the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and
implications of rating agency actions and offering prices.
table of contents
other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities and equity securities
for fixed maturity investments that the company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company would
not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit
loss component in net realized investment gains (losses). the impairment related to all other factors is reported in other comprehensive income.
for
equity securities (including public common and non-redeemable preferred stock) and for fixed maturity investments the company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not
that the company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses).
upon
recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net
realized investment gains (losses). the new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however, for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis
and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment.
due
to the subjective nature of the company's analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the company
could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer. additionally, it is possible that the issuer's actual ability to
meet contractual obligations may be different than what the company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods.

note1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of investment impairments.
goodwill and other intangible assets impairments
see note1 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments of goodwill and other
intangible assets.
other uncertainties
for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the company's results of operations or financial position, see
note16 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements and "item1arisk factors."
future application of accounting standards
see note1 of the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting
standards updates.
the
company is currently required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), as promulgated by the financial accounting
standards board (fasb). during the last several years, the securities and exchange commission (sec) has been evaluating whether, when and how international financial reporting standards (ifrs) should
be incorporated into the u.s. financial reporting system. in july 2012, the sec staff issued a final report on its work plan which concluded that ifrs provide high quality accounting standards, but
also indicated concerns with funding, consistency of application and enforcement of ifrs globally. in november 2014, the sec announced that it intends to develop a recommendation in the next couple of
months on whether the sec should move towards using ifrs for public companies.
table of contents
the
fasb and the international accounting standards board (iasb) are in the final phases of their long-term convergence program with the intent of developing global standards for several
significant areas of accounting, including the accounting for insurance contracts and financial instruments. in february 2014, the fasb decided to discontinue the full insurance project and instead
make targeted changes to u.s.gaap for insurance contracts. for property and casualty insurance contracts, the fasb decided to limit the targeted improvements to enhanced disclosures and is
targeting the first quarter of 2015 to finalize the new disclosure requirements. the iasb is expected to complete its project in 2016 which may require valuation and accounting that is significantly
different than under the u.s.gaap model for short-duration contracts.
in
2014, the iasb issued a final financial instruments standard with an effective date of january1, 2018, which provides guidance that is significantly different than current
u.s.gaap, e.g.,under the new ifrs standard changes in the fair value of investments in equity securities would be reported in earnings whereas current u.s.gaap reports such
changes in other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders' equity. the fasb is in the final stages of completing an update to its current financial instruments guidance. the fasb has
tentatively decided on different models for impairments, and classification and measurement of financial instruments than the iasb. the tentative fasb decisions would result in minor changes in the
accounting of financial instruments for the company's consolidated financial statements.
it
appears likely that the boards will have different insurance and financial instrument standards that could result in the company having to apply accounting standards for its
consolidated financial statements that are different from the accounting standard used for local reporting in foreign jurisdictions.
the
company is not able to predict whether it will choose to, or be required to, adopt ifrs or how the adoption of ifrs may impact the company's financial statements in the future.
forward-looking statements

item7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
market risk
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates (inclusive of credit
spreads), foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related
underlying assets are traded. the following is a discussion of the company's primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of december31, 2014. the company's market risk
sensitive instruments, including derivatives, are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading.
the
carrying value of the company's investment portfolio at december31, 2014 and 2013 was $73.26billion and $73.16billion, respectively, of which 87% was invested
in fixed maturity securities at both dates. at december31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 8.7% and 9.3%, respectively, of the company's invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies.
the company's exposure to equity price risk is not significant. the company has no direct commodity risk and is not a party to any credit default swaps.
the
primary market risks to the investment portfolio are interest rate risk and credit risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. the portfolio duration is primarily
managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions. for additional information regarding the company's investments, see notes3 and 4 of notes to the company's
consolidated financial statements as well as the "investment portfolio" and "outlook" sections of "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations."
the
primary market risk for all of the company's debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing. the company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing
opportunities as maturity dates approach. for additional information regarding the company's debt see note8 of notes to the company's consolidated financial statements as well as the
"liquidity and capital resources" section of "item7management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
the
company's foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the company's invested assets, insurance reserves and shareholders' equity denominated in foreign currencies. cash
flows from the company's foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies. the company purchases these investments primarily to fund
insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency, effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure. invested assets denominated in the canadian dollar
comprised approximately 5.2% and 5.5% of the total invested assets at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. invested assets denominated in the british pound sterling comprised approximately
2.2%
table of contents
and
2.4% of total invested assets at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. invested assets denominated in other currencies at december31, 2014 and 2013 were not material.
there
were no other significant changes in the company's primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended december31, 2014 compared to the
year ended december31, 2013. the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting
periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.
sensitivity analysis
sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings, fair values or cash flows of market sensitive
instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period of time. in the company's sensitivity analysis model, a
hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. "near-term" means a period of time going forward up to one year from
the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure, especially since this sensitivity analysis does
not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value.
interest rate risk
in this sensitivity analysis model, the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss. the sensitivity analysis model includes
the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading: fixed maturities, non-redeemable preferred stocks, mortgage loans, short-term securities, debt and derivative
financial instruments. the primary market risk to the company's market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk (inclusive of credit spreads). the sensitivity analysis model uses various basis
point changes in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model.
for
invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk, estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result
from a parallel increase in interest rates. durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put and interest rate reset features. durations on tax-exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that
the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the u.s. treasury curve. fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis, including
accrued interest, using holdings as of december31, 2014 and 2013.
for
debt, the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical december31, 2014 and 2013 ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a 100 basis point change,
comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices, and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding.
the
sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately $1.77billion and $1.90billion based on a
100 basis point increase in interest rates at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the
loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from
emerging interest rate trends. in addition, the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company's financial instruments.
table of contents
foreign currency exchange rate risk
the company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments. a
hypothetical 10% reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings. the company's analysis indicates that a
hypothetical 10% reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $635million and $681million at
december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries         notes to consolidated financial statements
1. summary of significant accounting policies
basis of presentation
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the travelers companies,inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the
company). the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
claims and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. certain reclassifications have been made to the 2013 and 2012 financial statements to conform to the
2014 presentation, including reclassifications related to the realignment of the company's reportable business segments described in the "nature of operations" section of this note. all material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
on
november1, 2013, the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of dominion for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.035billion. dominion
primarily markets personal lines and small commercial insurance business in canada. at the acquisition date, the company recorded at fair value $3.91billion of assets acquired and
$2.88billion of liabilities assumed as part of purchase accounting, including $16million of identifiable intangible assets and $273million of goodwill. dominion is included in
the company's business and international insurance segment. the unearned premium reserve related to the acquired insurance and reinsurance contracts was carried over and included in the company's
unearned premium reserve. premium revenue from the acquired business is recognized on a pro rata basis beginning with the acquisition date over the remaining policy terms in accordance with the
company's accounting policy. the company recognized an intangible asset for the value of business acquired (voba) of $76million at the acquisition date. voba represented the present value of
future gross profits of the business acquired from dominion, was reported as part of the company's deferred acquisition costs, and was amortized in proportion to the premium revenue recognized from
the acquired business.
adoption of accounting standards updates
obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount
of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date
in february 2013, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued updated guidance to resolve diversity in practice concerning
the recognition, measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from certain joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount under the arrangement is fixed at the reporting
date. the guidance requires that the reporting entity measure joint and several liability arrangements as the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among the
co-obligors and any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. the updated guidance was effective for the quarter ending march31, 2014. the adoption of
this guidance did not have any effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
parent's accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain
subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity
in march 2013, the fasb issued updated guidance to resolve diversity in practice concerning the release of the cumulative foreign
currency translation adjustment into net income when a parent sells a
table of contents

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
part
or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. when a company ceases to have a
controlling financial interest in a subsidiary within a foreign entity, the company should recognize any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results
in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary had resided. upon the partial sale of an equity method investment that is a foreign entity, the
company should release into earnings a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment. upon the partial sale of an equity method investment that is not a foreign entity, the company should
release into earnings the cumulative translation adjustment if the partial sale represents a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity that holds the equity method
investment. the updated guidance was effective for the quarter ending march31, 2014. the adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on the company's results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.
accounting standards not yet adopted
reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity
in april 2014, the fasb issued revised guidance to reduce diversity in practice for reporting discontinued operations. under the
previous guidance, any component of an
entity that was a reportable segment, an operating segment, a reporting unit, a subsidiary or an asset group was eligible for discontinued operations presentation. the revised guidance only allows
disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift (e.g.,disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment, or other major
parts of an entity) and that have a major effect on a reporting entity's operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. the revised guidance also requires expanded
disclosure in the financial statements for discontinued operations as well as for disposals of significant components of an entity that do not qualify for discontinued operations presentation. the
updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending march31, 2015. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the company's results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.
revenue from contracts with customers
in may 2014, the fasb issued updated guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. while insurance contracts are not
within the scope of this updated guidance, the company's fee income related to providing claims and policy management services as well as claim and loss prevention services will be subject to this
updated guidance.
the
updated guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue as performance obligations are met, in order to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration the entity is entitled to receive for those goods or services. the following steps are applied in the updated guidance: (1)identify the contract(s) with a
customer; (2)identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3)determine the transaction price; (4)allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the
contract; and (5)recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
the
updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending march31, 2017. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the company's results of
operations, financial position or liquidity.

accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance
target could be achieved after the requisite service period
in june 2014, the fasb issued updated guidance to resolve diversity in practice concerning employee share-based payments that contain
performance targets that could be achieved after the requisite service period. many reporting entities account for performance targets that could be achieved after the requisite service period as
performance conditions that affect the vesting of the award and, therefore, do not reflect the performance targets in the estimate of the grant-date fair value of the award. other reporting entities
treat those performance targets as nonvesting conditions that affect the grant-date fair value of the award.
the
updated guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that can be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. as such,
the performance target that affects vesting should not be reflected in estimating that fair value of the award at the grant date. compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it
becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which service has been rendered. if the performance target
becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for which requisite service has not yet been rendered is recognized prospectively
over the remaining service period. the total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be
adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest.
the
updated guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to
have a material effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern
in august 2014, the fasb issued guidance to address the diversity in practice in determining when there is substantial doubt about an
entity's ability to continue as a going concern and when an entity must disclose certain relevant conditions and events. the new guidance requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or
events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or
available to be issued). the new guidance allows the entity to consider the mitigating effects of management's plans that will alleviate the substantial doubt and requires certain disclosures when
substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans. if conditions or events raise substantial doubt that is not alleviated, an entity
should disclose that there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be
issued), along with the principal conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity's ability to
meet its obligations and management's plans that are intended to mitigate those conditions.
the
guidance is effective for annual periods ending after december15, 2016, and interim and annual periods thereafter.

determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a
share is more akin to debt or to equity
in november 2014, the fasb issued updated guidance to clarify when the separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid
financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share is required. that is, an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature
are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract. specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features, including the embedded derivative
feature being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the nature of the host contract. furthermore, the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic
characteristics and risks of the host contract. rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument.
the
updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december15, 2015. early adoption is permitted. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a
material effect on the company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
accounting policies
investments
fixed maturity and equity securities
fixed maturities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks. fixed maturities, including instruments subject to securities
lending agreements, are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to other
comprehensive income. equity securities, which include public common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are classified as available for sale with changes in fair value, net of income taxes, charged
or credited directly to other comprehensive income.
real estate investments
the company's real estate investments include warehouses, office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly
owned. real estate is recorded on the purchase date at the purchase price, which generally represents fair value, and is supported by internal analysis or external appraisals that use discounted cash
flow analyses and other acceptable valuation techniques. real estate held for investment purposes is subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
buildings
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the expected useful life of the building or 39years. real estate held for sale is carried at lower of cost
or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
short-term securities
short-term securities have an original maturity of less than one year and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
other investments
investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships
table of contents

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
the
company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. the partnerships and the hedge funds
generally report investments on their balance sheet at fair value. the financial statements prepared by the investee are received by the company on a lag basis, with the lag period generally dependent
upon the type of underlying investments. the private equity and real estate partnerships provide financial information quarterly which is generally available to investors, including the company,
within three to six months following the date of the reporting period. the hedge funds provide financial information monthly, which is generally available to investors within one month following the
date of the reporting period. the company regularly requests financial information from the partnerships prior to the receipt of the partnerships' financial statements and records any material
information obtained from these requests in its consolidated financial statements.
other
also
included in other investments are non-public common and preferred equities, trading securities and derivatives. non-public common and preferred equities
are reported at
fair value with changes in fair value, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. trading securities are marked to market with the change in fair value recognized
in net investment income during the current period. the company sold all of its remaining trading securities during 2013. the company's derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value, with
the changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statement of income in net realized investment gains (losses). for a further discussion of the derivatives used by the company, see
note3.
net investment income
investment income from fixed maturities is recognized based on the constant effective yield method which includes an adjustment for
estimated principal pre-payments, if any. the effective yield used to determine amortization for fixed maturities subject to prepayment risk (e.g.,asset-backed, loan-backed and structured
securities) is recalculated and adjusted periodically based upon actual historical and/or projected future cash flows, which are obtained from a widely-accepted securities data provider. the
adjustments to the yield for highly rated prepayable fixed maturities are accounted for using the retrospective method. the adjustments to the yield for non-highly rated prepayable fixed maturities
are accounted for using the prospective method. dividends on equity securities (including those with transfer restrictions) are recognized in income when declared. rental income on real estate is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. see note3 for further discussion. investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships and joint
ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the company's share of the investee's earnings or losses in the fund is reported in net investment income. trading securities
are marked to market with the change in fair value recognized in net investment income during the current period. the company sold all of its remaining trading securities in 2013.
accrual
of income is suspended on non-securitized fixed maturities that are in default, or on which it is likely that future payments will not be made as scheduled. interest income on
investments in default is recognized only when payments are received. investments included in the consolidated balance sheet that were not income-producing for the preceding 12months were not
material.

in
the value. for fixed maturities where the company expects a recovery in value, not necessarily to par, the constant effective yield method is utilized, and the investment is amortized to the
expected recovery amount.
investment gains and losses
net realized investment gains and losses are included as a component of pretax revenues based upon specific identification of the
investments sold on the trade date. included in net realized investment gains (losses) are other-than-temporary impairment losses on invested assets other than those investments accounted for using
the equity method of accounting as described in the "investment impairments" section that follows.
investment impairments
the company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary impairments. some of the
factors considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1)for fixed maturity investments, whether the company intends to sell the investment or whether it is more likely
than not that the company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2)for non-fixed maturity investments, the company's ability and intent to retain
the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3)the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity
securities (i.e.,whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4)the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed
maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5)the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and
implications of rating agency actions and offering prices.
other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities and equity securities
for fixed maturity investments that the company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company would
not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit
loss component in net realized investment gains (losses). the impairment related to all other factors is reported in other comprehensive income.
for
equity securities (including public common and non-redeemable preferred stock) and for fixed maturity investments the company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not
that the company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses).
upon
recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net
realized investment gains (losses). the new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however, for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis
and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment.
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
determination of credit lossfixed maturities
the company determines the credit loss component of fixed maturity investments by utilizing discounted cash flow modeling to determine
the present value of the security and comparing the present value with the amortized cost of the security. if the amortized cost is greater than the present value of the expected cash flows, the
difference is considered a credit loss and recognized in net realized investment gains (losses).
for
non-structured fixed maturities (u.s. treasury securities, obligations of u.s. government and government agencies and authorities, obligations of states, municipalities and political
subdivisions, debt securities issued by foreign governments, and certain corporate debt), the estimate of expected cash flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery time frame and
assessing whether further principal and interest will be received. the determination of recovery value incorporates an issuer valuation assumption utilizing one or a combination of valuation methods
as deemed appropriate by the company. the company determines the undiscounted recovery value by allocating the estimated value of the issuer to the company's assessment of the priority of claims. the
present value of the cash flows is determined by applying the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied
rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment) and an estimated recovery time frame. generally, that time frame for securities for which the issuer is in bankruptcy is 12months. for
securities for which the issuer is financially troubled but not in bankruptcy, that time frame is generally 24months. included in the present value calculation are expected principal and
interest payments; however, for securities for which the issuer is classified as bankrupt or in default, the present value calculation assumes no interest payments and a single recovery amount.
in
estimating the recovery value, significant judgment is involved in the development of assumptions relating to a myriad of factors related to the issuer including, but not limited to,
revenue, margin and earnings projections, the likely market or liquidation values of assets, potential additional debt to be incurred pre- or post-bankruptcy/restructuring, the ability to shift
existing or new debt to different priority layers, the amount of restructuring/bankruptcy expenses, the size and priority of unfunded pension obligations, litigation or other contingent claims, the
treatment of intercompany claims and the likely outcome with respect to inter-creditor conflicts.
for
structured fixed maturity securities (primarily residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities), the company estimates the present value of the
security by projecting future cash flows of the assets underlying the securitization, allocating the flows to the various tranches based on the structure of the securitization and determining the
present value of the cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a
result of a previous impairment or changes in expected cash flows). the company incorporates levels of delinquencies, defaults and severities as well as credit attributes of the remaining assets in
the securitization, along with other economic data, to arrive at its best estimate of the parameters applied to the assets underlying the
securitization. in order to project cash flows, the following assumptions are applied to the assets underlying the securitization: (1)voluntary prepayment rates, (2)default rates and
(3)loss severity. the

real estate investments
on
at least an annual basis, the company obtains independent appraisals for substantially all of its real estate investments. in addition, the carrying value
of all real estate investments is reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. the review for
impairment considers the valuation from the independent appraisal, when applicable, and incorporates an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the real estate property. an impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the real estate property. the impairment loss is the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value.
other investments
investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships
the company reviews its investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships for impairment no
less frequently than quarterly and monitors the performance throughout the year through discussions with the managers/general partners. if the company becomes aware of an impairment of a partnership's
investments at the balance sheet date prior to receiving the partnership's financial statements, it will recognize an impairment by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the partnership with
a corresponding charge to net investment income.
changes in intent to sell temporarily impaired assets
the
company may, from time to time, sell invested assets subsequent to the balance sheet date that it did not intend to sell at the balance sheet date.
conversely, the company may not sell invested assets that it asserted that it intended to sell at the balance sheet date. such changes in intent are due to events occurring subsequent to the balance
sheet date. the types of events that may result in a change in intent include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances related to the invested asset
(e.g.,a downgrade or upgrade from a rating agency), significant unforeseen changes in liquidity needs, or changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment.
securities lending
the company has engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its
investments to other institutions for short periods of time. borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest.
this collateral is held by a third-party custodian, and the company has the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution borrowing the company's securities is in default under
the lending agreement. therefore, the company does not recognize the receipt of the
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
collateral
held by the third-party custodian or the obligation to return the collateral. the loaned securities remain a recorded asset of the company. the company accepts only cash as collateral for
securities on loan and restricts the manner in which that cash is invested.
reinsurance recoverables
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. the company reports its
reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. the allowance is based upon the company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection
periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. amounts deemed to be uncollectible, including amounts due from known insolvent
reinsurers, are written off against the allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. any subsequent collections of amounts previously written off are reported as part of claims and
claim adjustment expenses. the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from
reinsurer insolvencies.
deferred acquisition costs
incremental direct costs of acquired, new and renewal insurance contracts, consisting of commissions (other than contingent
commissions) and premium-related taxes, are capitalized and charged to expense pro rata over the contract periods in which the related premiums are earned. deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to
determine if they are recoverable from future income and, if not, are charged to expense. future investment income attributable to related premiums is taken into account in measuring the
recoverability of the carrying value of this asset. all other acquisition expenses are charged to operations as incurred.
contractholder receivables and payables
under certain workers' compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, the company is obligated to pay the claimant for the
full amount of the claim. the company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. these amounts are included on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet in
contractholder payables and contractholder receivables, respectively.
goodwill and other intangible assets
the company performs a review, on at least an annual basis, of goodwill held by the reporting units which are the company's three
operating and reportable segments: business and international insurance; bond& specialty insurance; and personal insurance. the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and
compares it to their carrying value, including goodwill. if the carrying values of the reporting units were to exceed their fair value, the amount of the impairment would be calculated and goodwill
adjusted accordingly.
the
company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. the discounted cash flow model is an income approach to valuation that is based on a
detailed cash flow analysis for deriving a current fair value of reporting units and is representative of the company's reporting units' current and expected future financial performance. the discount
rate assumptions

reflect
the company's assessment of the risks inherent in the projected future cash flows and the company's weighted-average cost of capital, and are compared against available market data for
reasonableness.
other
indefinite-lived intangible assets held by the company are also reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis. the classification of the asset as indefinite-lived is
reassessed and an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
intangible
assets that are deemed to have a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives. the carrying amount of intangible assets with a finite useful life is regularly
reviewed for indicators of impairment in value. impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the
difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
as
a result of the reviews performed for the years ended december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the
respective carrying value of its reporting units for those years and that goodwill was not impaired. the company also determined during its reviews for each year that its other indefinite-lived
intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent estimates for the ultimate cost of unpaid reported and unreported claims
incurred and related expenses. the reserves are adjusted regularly based upon experience. included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in the consolidated balance sheet are certain
reserves discounted to the present value of estimated future payments. the liabilities for losses for most long-term disability and annuity claim payments, primarily arising from workers' compensation
insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies, were discounted using a rate of 5% at both december31, 2014 and 2013. these discounted reserves totaled $2.01billion and
$2.21billion at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the
company performs a continuing review of its claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, including its reserving techniques and its reinsurance. the reserves are also reviewed
regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company. since the reserves are based on estimates, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such reserves. the effects of changes in such
estimated reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. such changes in estimates could occur in a future period and may be material to the
company's results of operations and financial position in such period.
other liabilities
included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet is the company's estimate of its liability for guaranty fund and other
insurance-related assessments. the
liability for expected state guaranty fund and other premium-based assessments is recognized as the company writes or becomes obligated to write or renew the premiums on which the assessments are
expected to be based. the liability for loss-based assessments is recognized as the related losses are incurred. at december31, 2014 and 2013, the company had a liability of
$245million and $261million, respectively, for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments and related recoverables of $15million and $14million,

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
respectively.
the liability for such assessments and the related recoverables are not discounted for the time value of money. the loss-based assessments are expected to be paid over a period ranging
from one year to the life expectancy of certain workers' compensation claimants and the recoveries are expected to occur over the same period of time.
also
included in other liabilities is an accrual for policyholder dividends. certain insurance contracts, primarily workers' compensation, are participating whereby dividends are paid to
policyholders in accordance with contract provisions. net written premiums for participating dividend policies were approximately 1%, 1% and 2% of total net written premiums for the years ended
december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. policyholder dividends are accrued against earnings using best available estimates of amounts to be paid. the liability accrued for policyholder
dividends totaled $54million and $53million at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
treasury stock
the cost of common stock repurchased by the company is reported as treasury stock and represents authorized and unissued shares of the
company under the minnesota business corporation act.
statutory accounting practices
the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the state of connecticut, are required to prepare statutory
financial statements in accordance with the
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance departments of the states of domicile. prescribed statutory accounting practices are those practices that are incorporated directly or by
reference in state laws, regulations, and general administrative rules applicable to all insurance enterprises domiciled in a particular state. the state of connecticut requires insurers domiciled in
connecticut to prepare their statutory financial statements in accordance with national association of insurance commissioners' (naic) statutory accounting practices.
permitted
statutory accounting practices are those practices that differ either from state-prescribed statutory accounting practices or naic statutory accounting practices.
the
company does not apply any statutory accounting practices that would be considered a prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practice that differs from naic statutory accounting
practices.
the
company's non-u.s. insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with the regulatory reporting requirements of their respective local jurisdiction.
premiums and unearned premium reserves
premiums are recognized as revenues pro rata over the policy period. unearned premium reserves represent the unexpired portion of
policy premiums. accrued retrospective premiums are included in premium balances receivable. premium balances receivable are reported net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible premium amounts.

1. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
ceded
premiums are charged to income over the applicable term of the various reinsurance contracts with third party reinsurers. prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired
portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as part of other assets.
fee income
fee income includes servicing fees from carriers and revenues from large deductible policies and service contracts and is recognized
pro rata over the contract or policy periods.
other revenues
other revenues include revenues from premium installment charges, which are recognized as collected, revenues of noninsurance
subsidiaries other than fee income and gains and losses on dispositions of assets and redemption of debt, and other miscellaneous revenues.
income taxes
the company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax effects attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. the effect of a change in tax laws or rates
on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not
that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
foreign currency translation
the company assigns functional currencies to its foreign operations, which are generally the currencies of the local operating
environment. foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the functional currency, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in earnings. functional currency amounts are then
translated into u.s. dollars. the foreign currency remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for items reported in the balance sheets and average exchange rates for
items recorded in earnings. the change in unrealized
foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year, net of tax, is a component of other comprehensive income.
share-based compensation
the company has an employee stock incentive compensation plan that permits grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock, stock units, performance awards and other share-based or share-denominated awards with respect to the company's common stock.
compensation
cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of an award, utilizing the assumptions discussed in note13. compensation cost is recognized for financial
reporting purposes over the period in which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). in connection with certain share-based awards,
participants are entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, either in cash or dividend equivalent shares, commensurate with the dividends paid to common shareholders. dividends and
dividend equivalent shares on awards that are expected to vest are recorded in retained earnings. dividends paid on awards

nature of operations
the company is organized into three reportable business segments: business and international insurance; bond& specialty
insurance; and personal insurance. on june10, 2014, the company announced a realignment of its management team, effective july1, 2014, that gave rise to a realignment of two of its
three reportable business segments, as follows:

the bond& financial products group, which comprised the remaining businesses in the financial, professional&
international insurance segment, now comprises the new bond& specialty insurance segment.
the personal insurance segment was not impacted by these changes.
the
realignment of segments described above was made to reflect the realignment of the company's senior management responsibilities and the manner in which the company's businesses have
been managed starting july1, 2014, and the aggregation of products and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which risks are underwritten. in

specific business segments are as follows:

2. segment information
the accounting policies used to prepare the segment reporting data for the company's three reportable business segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies in note1.
except
as described below for certain legal entities, the company allocates its invested assets and the related net investment income to its reportable business segments. pretax net
investment income is allocated based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment. for
investable funds, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the estimated duration of the loss reserves' future cash flows, the interest rate environment at the time the losses were
incurred and a+ rated corporate debt instrument yields. for capital, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the average yield on the total investment portfolio. the benchmark
investment yields are applied to each segment's investable funds and capital, respectively, to produce a total notional investment income by segment. the company's actual net investment income is
allocated to each segment in proportion to the respective segment's notional investment income to total notional investment income. there are certain legal entities within the company that are
dedicated to specific reportable business segments. the invested assets and related net investment income from these legal entities are reported in the applicable business segment and are not
allocated among the other business segments.

proceeds
from the sale of real estate investments were $15million, $18million and $53million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. gross gains of
$6million, $7million and $19million were realized on those sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and there were no gross losses. the company had no real estate held for
sale at december31, 2014 and 2013. accumulated depreciation on real estate held for investment purposes was $290million and $264million at december31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.
future
minimum rental income on operating leases relating to the company's real estate properties is expected to be $85million, $72million, $56million,
$44million and $34million for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and $64million for 2020 and thereafter.
short-term securities
the company's short-term securities consist of aaa-rated registered money market funds, u.s. treasury securities, high-quality
commercial paper (primarily a1/p1) and high-quality corporate securities purchased within a year to their maturity with a combined average of 57days to maturity at december31, 2014.
the amortized cost of these securities, which totaled $4.36billion and $3.88billion at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, approximated their fair value.
variable interest entities
entities which do not have sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support
or in which the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of a controlling financial interest are referred to as variable interest entities (vie). a vie is consolidated by the
variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest (primary beneficiary) as a result of having both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most
significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. the company
determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of an entity subject to consolidation based on a qualitative assessment of the vie's capital structure, contractual terms, nature of the vie's
operations and purpose and the company's relative exposure to the related risks of the vie on the date it
becomes initially involved in the vie. the company reassesses its vie determination with respect to an entity on an ongoing basis.
the
company is a passive investor in limited partner equity interests issued by third party vies. these include certain of the company's investments in private equity limited
partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships where the company is not related to the general partner. these investments are generally accounted for under the equity method and reported in
the company's consolidated balance sheet as other investments unless the company is deemed the primary beneficiary. these equity interests generally cannot be redeemed. distributions from these
investments are received by the company as a result of liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds and/or as income distribution. the company's maximum exposure to loss with respect to
these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the company's consolidated balance sheet and any unfunded commitment. neither the carrying amounts nor the unfunded
commitments related to these vies are material.

concentrations and credit quality
concentrations of credit risk arise from exposure to counterparties that are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic
characteristics that could cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. the company seeks to mitigate credit risk by
actively monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties, obtaining collateral as deemed appropriate and applying controls that include credit approvals, limits of credit exposure and other
monitoring procedures.
at
december31, 2014 and 2013, other than u.s. treasury securities, obligations of u.s. government and government agencies and authorities, and obligations of the canadian
government, the company was not exposed to any concentration of credit risk of a single issuer greater than 5% of the company's shareholders' equity.
included
in fixed maturities are below investment grade securities totaling $1.91billion and $1.93billion at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company
defines its below investment grade securities as those securities rated below investment grade by external rating agencies, or the equivalent by the company when a public rating does not exist. such
securities include below investment grade bonds that are publicly traded and certain other privately issued bonds that are classified as below investment grade loans.

derivative financial instruments
from time to time, the company enters into u.s. treasury note futures contracts to modify the effective duration of specific assets
within the investment portfolio. u.s. treasury futures contracts require a daily mark-to-market and settlement with the broker. at december31, 2014 and 2013, the company had
$350million and $0 notional value of open u.s. treasury futures contracts, respectively. net realized investment gains in 2014, 2013 and 2012 included net losses of $1million, net
gains of $115million and net losses of $14million, respectively, related to u.s. treasury futures contracts.
the
company purchases investments that have embedded derivatives, primarily convertible debt securities. these embedded derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in value
reflected in net realized investment gains. derivatives embedded in convertible debt securities are reported on a combined basis with their host instrument and are classified as fixed maturity
securities. the company recorded net realized losses of less than $1million in 2014, net realized investment gains of less than $1million in 2013 and net realized investment losses of
less than $1million in 2012 related to these embedded derivatives.
4. fair value measurements
the company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. the framework is based
on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. the disclosure of fair
value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the
estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the company's significant market
assumptions. the level in the fair value hierarchy
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
4. fair value measurements (continued)
within
which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the hierarchy are as
follows:
level1unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability to access.
level2quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g.,interest rates, yield
curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.
level3valuations based on models where significant inputs are not
observable. the unobservable inputs reflect the company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use.
valuation of investments reported at fair value in financial statements
the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction
between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e.,not in a forced transaction. the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the
security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g.,a forced transaction. additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based
inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.
for
investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in
level1 of the hierarchy. the company receives the quoted market prices from third party, nationally recognized pricing services. when quoted market prices are unavailable, the company utilizes
these pricing services to determine an estimate of fair value. the fair value estimates provided from these pricing services are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. if
quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the
level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as level2 or level3. the company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it
represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction.
fixed maturities
the company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities at both
december31, 2014 and 2013. the pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. since fixed maturities other than u.s.
treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which
include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. additionally, the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread
model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
4. fair value measurements (continued)
the pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. the market inputs utilized
in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids,
offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. the extent of the use of each market input depends on the
asset class and the market conditions. depending on the security, the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. for some securities, additional inputs may be
necessary.
the
pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that it will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. if
the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to
make assumptions for any market-based inputs that were unavailable due to market conditions.
the
fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed
maturities, other than u.s. treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. the estimated fair value of u.s. treasury
securities is included in the amount disclosed in level1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.
the
company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and, accordingly, estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an
internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. the underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the u.s.
treasury curve are the bofa merrill lynch u.s. corporate index and the bofa merrill lynch high yield bb rated index. the company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in
level2, since all significant inputs are market observable.
while
the vast majority of the company's municipal bonds and corporate bonds are included in level2, the company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are
not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. due to the limited
amount of observable market information, the company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in level3. the fair value of the fixed maturities for which the company used
an internal pricing matrix was $92million and $94million at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. additionally, the company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity
investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. for these fixed maturities, the company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). the fair value
of the fixed maturities for which the company received a broker quote was $140million and $161million at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. due to the disclaimers on the
quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, the company includes these fair value estimates in level3.
equity securitiespublic common stock and non-redeemable preferred stock
for public common stock and non-redeemable preferred stocks, the company receives prices from pricing services that are based on
observable market transactions and includes these estimates in the amount disclosed in level1. when current market quotes in active markets are unavailable for certain
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
4. fair value measurements (continued)
non-redeemable
preferred stocks held by the company, the company receives an estimate of fair value from the pricing services. the services utilize similar methodologies to price the non-redeemable
preferred stocks as they do for the fixed maturities. the company includes the fair value estimate for these non-redeemable preferred stocks in the amount disclosed in level2.
other investments
the company holds investments in various publicly-traded securities which are reported in other investments. these investments include
mutual funds and other small holdings. the $19million fair value of these investments at both december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was disclosed in level1. at
december31, 2014 and 2013, the company held investments in non-public common and preferred equity securities, with fair value estimates of $36million and $34million,
respectively, reported in other investments, where the fair value estimate is determined either internally or by an external fund manager based on recent filings, operating results, balance sheet
stability, growth and other business and market sector fundamentals. due to the significant unobservable inputs in these valuations, the company includes the total fair value estimate for all of these
investments at december31, 2014 and 2013 in the amount disclosed in level3.
derivatives
at december31, 2014 and 2013, the company held $4million and $8million, respectively, of convertible bonds
containing embedded conversion options that are valued separately from the host bond contract in the amount disclosed in level2fixed maturities.

financial instruments disclosed, but not carried, at fair value
the company uses various financial instruments in the normal course of its business. the company's insurance contracts are excluded
from fair value of financial instruments accounting guidance and, therefore, are not included in the amounts discussed below. the following tables present the carrying value and fair value of the
company's financial assets and financial liabilities disclosed, but not carried, at fair value at december31, 2014 and 2013, and the level within the fair value hierarchy at which such assets

the
company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value for approximately 98% and 97% of short-term securities at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. a description of
the process and inputs used by the pricing service to estimate fair value is discussed in the "fixed maturities" section above. estimates of fair value
for u.s. treasury securities and money market funds are based on market quotations received from the pricing service and are disclosed in level1 of the hierarchy. the fair value of other
short-term fixed maturity securities is estimated by the pricing service using observable market inputs and is disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. for short-term securities where an estimate
is not obtained from the pricing service, the carrying value approximates fair value and is included in level3 of the hierarchy.
the
company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value for 100% of its debt, including commercial paper, at december31, 2014 and 2013. the pricing service utilizes market
quotations for debt that have quoted prices in active markets. since fixed maturities other than u.s. treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the fair value estimates are based on
market observable inputs and disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy.
the
company had no material assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended december31, 2014 and 2013.

5. reinsurance
the company's consolidated financial statements reflect the effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions. assumed reinsurance refers to the acceptance of certain insurance risks
that other
insurance companies have underwritten. ceded reinsurance involves transferring certain insurance risks (along with the related written and earned premiums) the company has underwritten to other
insurance companies who agree to share these risks. the primary purpose of ceded reinsurance is to protect the company, at a cost, from losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept and to
protect the company's capital. reinsurance is placed on both a quota-share and excess-of-loss basis. ceded reinsurance arrangements do not discharge the company as the primary insurer, except for
instances where the primary policy or policies have been novated, such as in certain structured settlement agreements.
the
company utilizes general corporate catastrophe treaties with unaffiliated reinsurers to help manage its exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes and protect its capital. in
addition to the coverage provided under these treaties, the company also utilizes catastrophe bonds to protect against hurricane losses in the northeastern united states, and a northeast catastrophe
reinsurance treaty to protect against losses resulting from weather-related and earthquake catastrophes in the northeastern united states. the company also utilizes excess-of-loss treaties to protect
against earthquake losses up to a certain threshold in the business and international insurance segment (for certain markets) and for the personal insurance segment, and several reinsurance treaties
specific to its international operations.
the
company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to evaluate the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers and as a basis for
determining the reinsurers with which the company conducts ongoing business. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the company may become involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers.
some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. the
company employs dedicated specialists and strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.
included
in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to involuntary reinsurance arrangements. the company is required to participate in various involuntary reinsurance arrangements
through assumed reinsurance, principally with regard to residual market mechanisms in workers' compensation and automobile insurance, as well as homeowners' insurance in certain coastal areas. in
addition, the company provides services for several of these involuntary arrangements (mandatory pools and associations) under which it writes such residual market business directly, then cedes 100%
of this business to the mandatory pool. such participations and servicing arrangements are arranged to mitigate credit risk to the company, as any ceded balances are jointly backed by all the pool
members.
also
included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements. structured settlements are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle
certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured
settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as the company retains the contingent
liability to the claimant. if it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the company would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent,
the purchased annuities are not

terrorism risk insurance program
the terrorism risk insurance program is a federal program administered by the department of the treasury that provides for a system of
shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism. the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized, with some adjustments to its
provisions, in january 2015 for six years through december31, 2020.
table of contents
the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
5. reinsurance (continued)
in order for a loss to be covered under the program (subject losses), the loss must meet certain aggregate industry loss minimums and must be the result of an event that is certified as
an act of terrorism by the u.s. secretary of the treasury, in consultation with the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general of the united states. the annual aggregate industry loss
minimum under the reauthorized program is initially $100million for 2015, but will increase over the six-year life
of the program to $200million by december31, 2020. the program excludes from participation the following types of insurance: federal crop insurance, private mortgage insurance,
financial guaranty insurance, medical malpractice insurance, health or life insurance, flood insurance, reinsurance, commercial automobile, professional liability (other than directors and officers'),
surety, burglary and theft, and farm-owners multi-peril. in the case of a war declared by congress, only workers' compensation losses are covered by the program. all commercial property and casualty
insurers licensed in the united states are generally required to participate in the program. under the reauthorized program, a participating insurer, in exchange for making terrorism insurance
available, is initially entitled to be reimbursed by the federal government for 85% of subject losses, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap. this reimbursement percentage will
decrease over the six-year life of the program to 80% of subject losses by december31, 2020.
the
deductible for any calendar year is equal to 20% of the insurer's direct earned premiums for covered lines for the preceding calendar year. the company's estimated deductible under
the program is $2.38billion for 2015. the annual cap limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100billion. once subject losses have reached the
$100billion aggregate during a program year, participating insurers will not be liable under the program for additional covered terrorism losses for that program year. there have been no
terrorism-related losses that have triggered program coverage since the program was established. since the law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied if an act of
terrorism is certified under the program. it is also possible that future legislative action could change or eliminate the program. further, given the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism
losses, as well as the limited terrorism coverage in the company's own reinsurance program, future losses from acts of terrorism, particularly involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological
events, could be material to the company's operating results, financial position and/or liquidity in future periods. in addition, the company may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims
arising from a high frequency of high severity natural catastrophes and/or of man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means. while the company seeks to manage its exposure to man-made
catastrophic events involving conventional means, the company may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or more man-made catastrophic events involving nuclear,
biological, chemical or radiological means.

intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheet, and the amounts measured in accordance with the acquirer's accounting policies for insurance contracts have been reported as part of the claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. the intangible assets are being recognized into income over the expected payment pattern. because the time value of money and the risk
adjustment (cost of capital) components of the intangible assets run off at different rates, the amount recognized in income may be a net benefit in some periods and a net expense in other periods.
additionally, $5million of contract-related intangibles were recorded related to operating leases in connection with the acquisition of dominion in 2013.

asbestos and environmental reserves
at december31, 2014 and 2013, the company's claims and claim adjustment expense reserves included $2.70billion and
$2.69billion, respectively, for asbestos and environmental-related claims, net of reinsurance.
it
is difficult to estimate the reserves for asbestos and environmental-related claims due to the vagaries of court coverage decisions, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, the
risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, including, without limitation, those which are set forth below.
asbestos reserves.because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the company generally reviews the
exposure presented
by each policyholder at least annually. among the factors which the company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess
insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim
activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos
claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a
products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.

7. insurance claim reserves (continued)
in
the third quarter of 2014, the company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and
"non-product" liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:
continued high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness,
primarily involving mesothelioma claims;
while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to the
continued high level of litigation activity; and
continued moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity.
while
the company believes that over the past several years there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the company's overall asbestos exposure, there nonetheless
remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims.
the
home office and field office categories, which account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, experienced a slight increase in net
asbestos-related payments in 2014 when compared with 2013. the number of policyholders with pending asbestos claims in these categories as of december31, 2014 was essentially unchanged when
compared with december31, 2013. payments on behalf of policyholders in these categories continue to be influenced by the high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions
where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation.
the
company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder
bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. the company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office, field office and assumed reinsurance and other
categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. in addition, the company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any
emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves nor have the company's
evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.
the
completion of these reviews and analyses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 resulted in $250million, $190million and $175million increases, respectively, in the company's
net asbestos reserves. in each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of
policyholders in the home office category due to a higher level of litigation activity surrounding mesothelioma claims than previously anticipated. in addition, the reserve increases in 2013 and 2012
also reflected higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance accounts. the increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher
than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above. notwithstanding these trends, the company's
overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.
net
asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $242million, $218million and $236million, respectively. approximately 8%, 1% and 6% of total

and
2012, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the company's liability.
environmental reserves.in establishing environmental reserves, the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and
the anticipated
cost of resolution, if any. in the course of this analysis, the company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. in addition, the company
considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each
site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site;
the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder; the
involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental
claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. the evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that policyholder and the
many variables presented is developed. conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves.
the
company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980's. these policyholders continue to
present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based
site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. over the past several years, the company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental
claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. however, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less
than anticipated. in addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims has been greater than anticipated. as a result of these factors, in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company increased its
net environmental reserves by $87million, $65million and $90million, respectively.
asbestos and environmental reserves.as a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves
carried for
asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. however, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these
claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. as a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new
information becomes available and as claims develop. the continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the
bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims
beyond that which is anticipated, the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle
improvements, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and
environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the company, future developments pertaining to
the company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and
table of contents

7. insurance claim reserves (continued)
environmental
claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other
participating insurers. in addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory
and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. this environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court
and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. it is
also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the
dispute is adjudicated. this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be
effective. as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.
because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the company's current reserves. in addition, the company's estimate of claims and
claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that
could be material to the company's operating results in future periods.
catastrophe exposure
the company has geographic exposure to catastrophe losses, which can be caused by a variety of events, including, among others,
hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares.
catastrophes can also result from terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts (including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events), explosions and
infrastructure failures. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in
the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in larger
areas, especially those that are heavily populated. the company generally seeks to mitigate its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance.
there
are also risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. for example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of the
company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information
available to establish the reserves. complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution
exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; the potential impact of changing climate conditions, including higher frequency and severity of weather-related events;
infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage and business income interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. the timing of a catastrophe's occurrence, such as at or near the end
of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to us in estimating reserves for that reporting period. the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.

description of debt
commercial paperthe company maintains an $800million commercial paper program, supported by a $1.0billion bank credit agreement that
expires on june7, 2018. (see "credit agreement" discussion that follows). interest rates on commercial paper issued in 2014 ranged from 0.08% to 0.15%, and in 2013 ranged from 0.08% to 0.13%.
senior notesthe company's various senior debt issues are unsecured obligations that rank equally with one another. interest payments are made
semi-annually. the company generally may redeem some or all of the notes prior to maturity in accordance with terms unique to each debt instrument.
junior subordinated debenturesthe company's $107million remaining aggregate principal amount of 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate debentures bear
interest at an annual rate of 6.25% from the date of issuance to, but excluding, march15, 2017, payable semi-annually in arrears on march15 and september15. from and including
march15, 2017, the debentures will bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month libor plus 2.215%, payable quarterly on march15, june15, september15 and
december15 of each year. the company can redeem the debentures at its option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after march15, 2017 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal
amount being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest. the company can redeem the debentures at its option prior to march15, 2017 (a)in whole at any time or in part from time to time
or (b)in whole, but not in part, in the event of certain tax or rating agency events relating to the debentures, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount
being redeemed and the applicable make-whole amount, in each case plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
the
company has the right, on one or more occasions, to defer the payment of interest on the debentures. the company will not be required to settle deferred interest until it has
deferred interest for five consecutive years or, if earlier, made a payment of current interest during a deferral period. the company may defer interest for up to ten consecutive years without giving
rise to an event of default. deferred interest will accumulate additional interest at an annual rate equal to the annual interest rate then applicable to the debentures.
the
debentures have a final maturity date of march15, 2067 and a scheduled maturity date of march15, 2037. the company can redeem the debentures at its option any time
(as described above) using any source of funds, including cash. if the company chooses not to redeem the debentures, then during the 180-day period ending not more than 15 and not less than ten
business days prior to the scheduled maturity date, the company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell enough qualifying capital securities to permit repayment of the
debentures at the scheduled maturity date. if any debentures remain outstanding after the scheduled maturity date, unless and until the company redeems the debentures (as described above) using any
source of funds, including cash, the

shall be required to use its commercially reasonable efforts on a quarterly basis to raise sufficient proceeds from the sale of qualifying capital securities to permit the repayment in full of
the
debentures. if there are remaining debentures at the final maturity date, the company is required to redeem the debentures using any source of funds. qualifying capital securities are securities
(other than common stock, qualifying warrants, mandatorily convertible preferred stock, debt exchangeable for common equity, and debt exchangeable for preferred equity) which generally are treated by
the ratings agencies as having similar equity content to the debentures.
the
company's three other junior subordinated debenture instruments are all similar in nature to each other. three separate business trusts issued preferred securities to investors and
used the proceeds to purchase the company's subordinated debentures. interest on each of the instruments is paid semi-annually.
the
company's consolidated balance sheet includes the debt instruments acquired in the merger, which were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. the resulting fair value
adjustment is being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments using the effective-interest method. the amortization of the fair value adjustment reduced interest expense by
$1million for each of the years ended december31, 2014 and 2013.

and (b)mandatorily convertible securities (combined with trust preferred securities, not to exceed 25% of total capital) less goodwill and other intangible assets, of
$13.73billion. in addition, the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of default, including with respect to a change in control,
which is defined to include the acquisition of 35% or more of the company's voting stock and certain changes in the composition of the company's board of directors. at december31, 2014, the
company was in compliance with these covenants. generally, the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from libor plus 87.5 basis points to libor plus 150 basis points, depending on the
company's credit ratings. at december31, 2014, that cost would have been libor plus 112.5 basis points, had there been any amounts outstanding under the credit agreement. this credit agreement
also supports the company's commercial paper program.
shelf registration
in june 2013, the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement for the potential
offering and sale of securities to replace the company's previous registration statement that had expired in the normal course of business. the company may offer these securities from time to time at
prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering.

the number of authorized shares of the company is 1.755billion, consisting of five million of preferred stock,
1.745billion shares of voting common stock and five million undesignated shares. the company's articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to establish, from the undesignated
shares, one or more classes and series of shares, and to further designate the type of shares and terms thereof.
preferred stock
in may 2013, the company's shareholders voted to amend the company's articles of incorporation to provide authority to issue up to five
million additional shares of preferred stock. subsequent to this amendment of the company's articles of incorporation, the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange
commission in june 2013 pursuant to which it may publicly sell securities, including the new preferred stock, from time to time. the new shelf registration statement replaced the company's prior shelf
registration statement.

dividend availability
the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the state of connecticut, are subject to various regulatory
restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid by each insurance subsidiary to its respective parent company without
prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. a maximum of $3.25billion is available by the end of 2015 for such dividends to the holding company, trv, without prior approval of the
connecticut insurance department. the company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2015 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2015, which could result in
certain dividends being subject to approval by the connecticut insurance department.
in
addition to the regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that can be paid by the company's u.s. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be
paid to the company's shareholders is limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the company to
maintain a minimum consolidated net worth as described in note8.

if
the company determines that any of its deferred tax assets will not result in future tax benefits, a valuation allowance must be established for the portion of these assets that are
not expected to be realized. based upon a review of the company's anticipated future taxable income, and also including
all other available evidence, both positive and negative, the company's management concluded that it is more likely than not that the gross deferred tax assets will be realized.
for
tax return purposes, as of december31, 2014, the company had net operating loss (nol) carryforwards in the united states, canada and the united kingdom. the amount and timing
of realizing the benefits of nol carryforwards depend on future taxable income and limitations imposed by tax laws. the benefits of the nol carryforwards have been recognized in the consolidated
financial statements and are included in net deferred tax assets. the nol amounts by jurisdiction and year of expiration are as follows:

distributions from such earnings.

uncertainty about the timing of deductibility. the timing of such deductibility would not affect the annual effective tax rate.
the
company recognizes accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes. during the years ended december31, 2014 and 2013, the company
recognized approximately $31million and $(67) million in interest, respectively. the company had approximately $58million and $27million accrued for the payment of interest at
december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the
irs is conducting an examination of the company's u.s. income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. the company does not expect any significant changes to its liability for unrecognized tax
benefits during the next twelve months.
13. share-based incentive compensation
the company has a share-based incentive compensation plan, the travelers companies,inc. 2014 stock incentive plan (the 2014 incentive plan), which was approved by the company's
shareholders in may 2014 and replaced the travelers companies,inc. amended and restated 2004 stock incentive plan, as amended (the 2004 incentive plan). the purposes of the 2014 incentive plan
are to align the interests of the company's non-employee directors, executive officers and other employees with those of the company's shareholders, and to attract and retain personnel by providing
incentives in the form of share-based awards. the 2014 incentive plan permits grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, deferred stock, deferred stock units, performance awards and other share-based or share-denominated awards with respect to the company's common stock. the number of shares of the
company's common stock authorized for grant under the 2014 incentive plan is 10million shares, subject to additional shares that may be
available for awards as described below. the company has a policy of issuing new shares to settle the exercise of stock option awards and the vesting of other equity awards.
in
connection with the adoption of the 2014 incentive plan, the 2004 incentive plan was terminated, joining several other legacy share-based incentive compensation plans that had been
terminated in prior years (together, the legacy plans). outstanding grants were not affected by the termination of the legacy plans, including the grant of reload options related to prior option
grants under the legacy plans. as of december31, 2012, there were no longer any options eligible for reload.

the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries
notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
13. share-based incentive compensation (continued)
the
2014 incentive plan is currently the only plan pursuant to which future stock-based awards may be granted. in addition to the 10million shares initially authorized for
issuance under the 2014 incentive plan, the following will not be counted towards the 10million shares available and will be available for future grants under the 2014 incentive plan:
(i)shares of common stock subject to awards that expire unexercised, that are forfeited, terminated or canceled, that are settled in cash or other forms of property, or otherwise do not result
in the issuance of shares of common stock, in whole or in part; (ii)shares that are used to pay the exercise price of stock options and shares used to pay withholding taxes on awards
generally; and (iii)shares purchased by the company on the open market using cash option exercise proceeds; provided, however, that the increase in the number of shares of common stock
available for grant pursuant to such market purchases shall not be greater than the number that could be repurchased at fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock option giving rise to
such option proceeds. in addition, the 10million shares initially authorized for issuance under the 2014 incentive plan will be increased by any shares subject to awards under the 2004
incentive plan that were outstanding as of may27, 2014 and subsequently expire, are forfeited, cancelled, settled in cash or otherwise terminate without the issuance of shares.
the
company also has a compensation program for non-employee directors (the director compensation program). under the director compensation program, non-employee directors' compensation
consists of an annual retainer, a deferred stock award, committee chair fees and a lead director fee. each non-employee director may choose to receive all or a portion of his or her annual retainer in
the form of cash or deferred stock units which vest upon grant. the annual deferred stock awards vest in full one day prior to the date of the company's annual meeting of shareholders occurring in the
year following the year of the grant date, subject to continued service. the deferred stock awards may accumulate, including reinvestment dividends, until distribution either in a lump sum six months
after termination of service as a director or, if the director so elects, in annual installments beginning at least six months following termination of service as a director. the shares of deferred
stock units issued under the director compensation program are awarded under the 2014 incentive plan.
stock option awards
stock option awards granted to eligible officers and key employees have a ten-year term. prior to january1, 2007, stock options
were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the company's common stock on the day preceding the date of grant. beginning january1, 2007, all stock options are granted
with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant. the stock options granted generally vest upon meeting certain years of service criteria. except as
the compensation committee of the board may allow in the future, stock options cannot be sold or transferred by the participant. the stock options granted under the 2014 incentive plan and the 2004
incentive plan vest three years after grant date (cliff vest).
in
addition to the stock option awards described above, certain stock option awards that were granted under legacy plans permitted an employee exercising an option to be granted a new
option (a reload option) at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's common stock on the date on which the original option was exercised. the reload option was permitted on
certain stock option awards granted prior to january 2003 at an amount equal to the number of shares of the common stock used to satisfy both the exercise price and withholding taxes due upon exercise
of an option and vest either six months or one year after the grant date and are exercisable for the remaining

term
of the related original option. as of december31, 2012, there were no longer any options eligible for reload.
the
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant by application of a variation of the black-scholes option pricing model using the assumptions noted in the following
table. the expected term of newly granted stock options is the time to vest plus half the remaining time to expiration. this considers the vesting restriction and represents an even pattern of
exercise behavior over the remaining term. reload options were exercisable for the remaining term of the original option and therefore generally had a shorter expected term. the expected volatility
assumption is based on the historical volatility of the company's common stock for the same period as the estimated option term based on the mid-month of the option grant. the expected dividend is
based upon the company's current quarter dividend annualized and assumed to be constant over the expected option term. the risk-free interest rate for each option is the interpolated market yield for
the mid-month of the option grant on a u.s. treasury bill with a term comparable to the expected option term of the granted stock option. shares received through option exercises under the reload
program were subject to either a one-year or two-year restriction on sale. a discount, as measured by the estimated cost of protecting against changes in market value5% for one-year sales
restrictions and 10% for two-year sales restrictionshad been applied to the fair value of reload options granted to reflect
these sales restrictions. the following assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of options on grant date for the years ended december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:

restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance share award programs
the company issues restricted stock unit awards to eligible officers and key employees under the equity awards program established
pursuant to the 2014 incentive plan. a restricted stock unit represents the right to receive a share of common stock. these restricted stock unit awards are granted at market price, generally vest
three years from the date of grant, do not have voting rights and the underlying shares of common stock are not issued until the vesting criteria is satisfied. in addition, the company's board of
directors can be issued deferred stock unit awards from (i)an annual award; (ii)deferred compensation (in lieu of cash retainer); and (iii)dividend reinvestment shares earned
on outstanding deferred compensation.

13. share-based incentive compensation (continued)
the
company also has a performance share awards program established pursuant to the 2004 incentive plan and which continues pursuant to the 2014 incentive plan. under the program, the
company may issue performance share awards to certain employees of the company who hold positions of vice president (or its equivalent) or above. the performance awards provide the recipient the right
to earn shares of the company's common stock based upon the company's attainment of certain performance goals and the recipient meeting certain years of service criteria. the performance goals for
performance awards are based on the company's adjusted return on equity over a three-year performance period. vesting of performance shares is contingent upon the company attaining the relevant
performance period minimum threshold return on equity and the recipient meeting certain years of service criteria, generally three years for full vesting, subject to proration for certain termination
conditions. if the performance period return on equity is below the minimum threshold, none of the shares will vest. if performance meets or exceeds the minimum performance threshold, a range of
performance shares will vest (50%130% for awards granted in february 2012
and 2013; and 50%150% for awards granted in 2014 and 2015), depending on the actual return on equity attained.
the
fair value of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance shares is measured at the market price of the company stock at date of grant. under terms of the 2014
incentive plan, holders of deferred stock units and performance shares may receive dividend equivalents.
the
total fair value of shares that vested during the years ended december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $147million, $151million and $146million,
respectively.

13. share-based incentive compensation (continued)
on
february3, 2015, the company, under the 2014 stock incentive plan, granted 1,044,313 common stock awards in the form of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and
performance share awards to participating officers, non-employee directors and other key employees. the restricted stock units and deferred stock units totaled 583,458 shares while the performance
share awards totaled 460,855 shares. the fair value per share attributable to the common stock awards on the date of grant was $106.04.
share-based compensation cost recognition
the amount of compensation cost for awards subject to a service condition is based on the number of shares expected to be issued and is
recognized over the time period for which service is to be provided (requisite service period). awards granted to retiree-eligible employees or to employees who become retiree-eligible before an
award's vesting date are considered to have met the requisite service condition. the compensation cost for awards subject to a performance condition is based upon the probable outcome of the
performance condition, which on the grant date reflects an estimate of attaining 100% of the performance shares granted. the compensation cost reflects an estimated annual forfeiture rate from 3.0% to
4.5% over the requisite service period of the awards. that estimate is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments expected to vest is likely to differ from
previous estimates. compensation costs for awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. for awards that have graded vesting terms, the compensation cost is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. the total compensation cost for
all share-based incentive compensation awards recognized in earnings for the years ended december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $138million, $129million and $120million,
respectively. included in these amounts are compensation cost adjustments of $14million, $8million and $4million, for the years ended december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, that reflected the cost associated with the updated estimate of performance shares due to attaining certain performance levels from the date of the initial grant of the performance
awards. the related tax benefits recognized in earnings were $47million, $45million and $42million for the years ended december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
at
december31, 2014, there was $123million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested share-based incentive compensation awards. this includes stock
options, restricted and deferred stock units and performance shares granted under the 2014 incentive plan and the 2004 incentive plan. the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 1.7years. cash received from the exercise of employee stock options under share-based compensation plans totaled $195million and $206million
in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the tax benefit realized for tax deductions from employee stock options exercised during 2014 and 2013 totaled $40million and $42million, respectively.
14. pension plans, retirement benefits and savings plans
the company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, which covers substantially all u.s. domestic employees and provides benefits under a cash balance formula,
except that employees satisfying certain age and service requirements remain covered by a prior final average pay formula. in addition, the company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan
which covers certain highly-compensated employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries,

pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, the aggregate projected benefit obligation was $3.53billion and $123million at
december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation was $3.43billion and $121million at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the fair value of plan assets for the above plans was $3.27billion and $33million at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the
company has discretion regarding whether to provide additional funding and when to provide such funding to its qualified domestic pension plan. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, there were no

the
discount rate assumption used to determine the benefit obligation was based on a yield-curve approach. under this approach, a weighted average yield is determined from a hypothetical
portfolio of high quality fixed maturity corporate bonds (rated aa) available at the year-end valuation date for which the timing and amount of cash outflows correspond with the timing and amount of
the estimated benefit payouts of the company's benefit plan.
in
choosing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company selected the rate that was set as the return objective by the company's benefit plans investment committee,
which had considered the historical returns of equity and fixed maturity markets in conjunction with prevailing economic and financial market conditions.
as
an indicator of sensitivity, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $29million at
december31, 2014, and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense by $1million for the year ended december31, 2014.
decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december31, 2014 by $24million and the aggregate of
the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense by $1million for the year ended december31, 2014.

the
assumptions made for the company's foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans are not materially different from those of the company's u.s. qualified domestic pension plan and
the postretirement benefit plan.
plan assets
the u.s. qualified domestic pension plan assets are invested for the exclusive benefit of the plan participants and beneficiaries and
are intended, over time, to satisfy the benefit obligations under the plan. risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial
position. the asset mix guidelines have been established and are reviewed quarterly. these guidelines are intended to serve as tools to facilitate the investment of plan assets to maximize long-term
total return and the ongoing oversight of the plan's investment performance. investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through daily and monthly investment portfolio reviews,
annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability studies.
the
company's overall investment strategy for the u.s. qualified domestic pension plan is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15%
for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. the current target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40%
fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. equity securities primarily include investments in large, medium and small-cap companies primarily located in the united
states. fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, u.s. treasury securities and debt securities issued by foreign
governments. other investments include two private equity funds held by the company's qualified defined benefit pension plan. one private equity fund is focused on financial companies, and the other
is focused on real estate-related investments.
assets
of the company's foreign pension plans are not significant.
fair value measurementpension plans and other postretirement benefit assets
for a discussion of the methods employed by the company to measure the fair value of invested assets, see note4. the following
discussion of fair value measurements applies exclusively to the company's pension plans and other postretirement benefit assets.
fair
value estimates for equity and bond mutual funds held by the pension plans reflect prices received from an external pricing service that are based on observable market transactions.
these estimates are included in level1.
short-term
securities are carried at fair value which approximates cost plus accrued interest or amortized discount. the fair value or market value of these is periodically compared to
this amortized cost and is based on significant observable inputs as determined by an external pricing service. accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such short-term securities, other than u.s.
treasury securities and money market mutual funds, provided by an external pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level2 of the hierarchy. the estimated fair value of u.s.
treasury securities and money market mutual funds is included in the amount disclosed in level1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.

savings plan
the company has a savings plan, the travelers 401(k) savings plan (the savings plan), in which substantially all u.s. domestic company
employees are eligible to participate. under the savings plan, the company matches employee contributions up to 5% of eligible pay, with a maximum annual match of $6,000 which becomes 100% vested
after three years of service. the company's matching contribution is made in cash and invested according to the employee's current investment elections and can be reinvested into other investment
options in accordance with the terms of the plan. the company's non-u.s. employees participate in separate savings plans. the total expense related to all of the savings plans was $103million,
$100million and $92million for the years ended december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
all
common shares held by the savings plan are considered outstanding for basic and diluted eps computations and dividends paid on all shares are charged to retained earnings.

asbestos and environmental claims and litigation
in the ordinary course of its insurance business, the company has received and continues to receive claims for insurance arising under
policies issued by the company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage litigation. the company is defending
asbestos- and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses; however, the outcomes of these disputes are uncertain. in this regard, the company employs
dedicated specialists and aggressive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under appropriate circumstances. currently, it is not
possible to predict legal outcomes and their impact on the future development of claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. any such development will be affected by future
court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the company's current
reserves. in addition, the company's estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. these additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be
reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the company's results of operations in future periods.
settlement of asbestos direct action litigation
in
october 2001 and april 2002, two purported class action suits (wise v. travelers and  meningerv.travelers) were filed against travelers property
casualty corp. (tpc), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, and other
insurers (not including the st.paul companies,inc. (spc), which was acquired by tpc in 2004) in state court in west virginia. these and other cases subsequently filed in west virginia
were consolidated into a single proceeding in the circuit court of kanawha county, west virginia. the plaintiffs alleged that the insurer defendants engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of
state statutes by inappropriately handling and settling asbestos claims. the plaintiffs sought to reopen large numbers of settled asbestos claims and to impose liability for damages, including
punitive damages, directly on insurers. similar lawsuits alleging inappropriate handling and settling of asbestos claims were filed in massachusetts and hawaii state courts. these suits are
collectively referred to as the statutory and hawaii actions.
in
march 2002, the plaintiffs in consolidated asbestos actions pending before a mass tort panel of judges in west virginia state court amended their complaint to include tpc as a
defendant, alleging that tpc and other insurers breached alleged duties to certain users of asbestos products. the plaintiffs sought damages, including punitive damages. lawsuits seeking similar
relief and raising similar allegations, primarily violations of purported common law duties to third parties, were also asserted in
various state courts against tpc and spc. the claims asserted in these suits are collectively referred to as the common law claims.
in
response to these claims, tpc moved to enjoin the statutory actions and the common law claims in the federal bankruptcy court that had presided over the bankruptcy of tpc's former
policyholder johns-manville corporation on the ground that the suits violated injunctions entered in connection with confirmation of the johns-manville bankruptcy (the 1986 orders). the bankruptcy
court issued a temporary restraining order and referred the parties to mediation. in november 2003, the parties reached a settlement of the statutory and hawaii actions, which included a lump-sum
payment of up to $412million by tpc, subject to a number of significant
table of contents

contingencies.
in may 2004, the parties reached a settlement resolving substantially all pending and similar future common law claims against tpc, which included a payment of up to $90million
by tpc, subject to similar contingencies.
after
the parties reached the settlements of the statutory and hawaiian actions and the common law claims (collectively "the settlements"), numerous proceedings took place in the
bankruptcy, district and appellate courts concerning the approval of the settlements and their effect on other parties. as a result of certain rulings in those proceedings, tpc concluded that it was
not obligated to go forward with the settlements because certain conditions precedent to the settlements had not been met.
the
plaintiffs in the statutory and hawaii actions and the common law claims actions thereafter filed motions in the bankruptcy court to compel tpc to make payment under the settlement
agreements, arguing that all conditions precedent to the settlements had been met. on december16, 2010, the bankruptcy court granted the plaintiffs' motions and ruled that tpc was required to
fund the settlements. the court entered judgment against tpc on january20, 2011 in accordance with this ruling and ordered tpc to pay the settlements plus prejudgment interest. the bankruptcy
court's judgment was reversed by the district court on march1, 2012, the district court having found that the conditions to the settlements had not been met. the plaintiffs appealed the
district court's march1, 2012 decision to the second circuit court of appeals. on july22, 2014, the second circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court's decision and
reinstating the bankruptcy court's january20, 2011 order which ordered tpc to pay the settlements plus prejudgment interest. on august5, 2014, tpc filed a petition for rehearing and
rehearing en banc with the second circuit, which was denied on january5, 2015. at december31, 2014, the amount of the company's payment
was recognized in the company's consolidated financial statements in the amount of $579million, comprising the $502million settlement amount described above, plus pre-judgment and
post-judgment interest totaling $77million.
on january15, 2015, the bankruptcy court entered an order directing tpc to pay $579million to the plaintiffs, and the company has made that payment.
other proceedings not arising under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements
the company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages relating to insurance contracts or
reinsurance agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements. the legal costs associated with such lawsuits are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.
based upon currently available information, the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the company's results of operations or
would have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position or liquidity.
gain contingencies
on august17, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in new york state court captioned united states
fidelity& guaranty company v. american re-insurance company, et al., the trial court granted summary judgment for united states fidelity and guaranty company (usf&g), a
subsidiary of the company, and denied summary judgment for american re-insurance company, a subsidiary of munich re (american re), and three other reinsurers. by order dated october22, 2010,

certain
clerical errors and made certain clarifications to the august17, 2010 order. on october25, 2010, judgment was entered against american re and the other three insurers, awarding
usf&g $420million, comprising $251million ceded under the terms of the disputed reinsurance contract plus interest of 9% amounting to $169million as of that date. the judgment,
including the award of interest, was appealed by the reinsurers to the new york supreme court, appellate division, first department. on january24, 2012, the appellate division affirmed the
judgment. on january30, 2012, the reinsurers filed a motion with the appellate division seeking permission to appeal its decision to the new york court of appeals, and on march12,
2012, the appellate division granted the reinsurers' motion. on february7, 2013, the court of appeals issued an opinion that largely affirmed the summary judgment in usf&g's favor, while
modifying in part the summary judgment with respect to two discrete issues
and remanding the case to the trial court for determination of those issues. the court set a trial date for august3, 2015. the company believes it has a meritorious position on each of these
issues and intends to pursue its claim vigorously. on may2, 2013, the court of appeals denied a motion by reinsurers to reconsider the february7, 2013 opinion. in november 2013, the
company entered into a settlement agreement with one of the reinsurers. at december31, 2014, the claim totaled $488million, comprising the $238million of reinsurance
recoverable plus interest amounting to $250million as of that date. interest will continue to accrue at an annual rate of 9% until the claim is paid. the $238million of reinsurance
recoverable owed to usf&g under the terms of the disputed reinsurance contract has been reported as part of reinsurance recoverables in the company's consolidated balance sheet. the interest that
would be owed as part of any judgment ultimately entered in favor of usf&g is treated for accounting purposes as a gain contingency in accordance with fasb topic 450,  contingencies, and accordingly
has not been recognized in the company's consolidated financial statements.
resolution of gain contingency
the
travelers indemnity company was one of the settlement class plaintiffs and a class member in a class action lawsuit captioned safeco insurance company of
america, et al. v american international group,inc. et al. (u.s. district court, n.d. ill.) in which the defendants were alleged to have engaged in the under-reporting
of workers' compensation premium in connection with a workers' compensation reinsurance pool in which several subsidiaries of the company participate. in february 2012, the district court issued a
written opinion approving the class settlement pursuant to which the defendants agreed to pay $450million to the class. in march 2012, three parties who objected to the settlement appealed the
court's orders approving the settlement to the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit. in january 2013, all parties, including the three parties who had objected to the settlement, filed a
stipulation of dismissal indicating that there were no longer any objections to the settlement, and in march 2013, the seventh circuit dismissed the appeals. in april 2013, the seventh circuit issued
its mandate returning the case to the district court for administration of the settlement. in june and november 2013, the company received two payments totaling approximately $93million,
comprising its allocation from the settlement fund. the combination of the payments received in june and november 2013 totaling $93million, less approximately $2million remitted to
another insurer, resulted in a net gain of $91million that was reported in "other revenues" in the company's consolidated statement of income for the year ended december31, 2013.

commitments
investment commitmentsthe company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships in which it invests.
these commitments totaled $1.63billion and $1.52billion at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
guarantees
in the ordinary course of selling businesses to third parties, the company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of
breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the businesses being sold, covenants and obligations of the company and/or its subsidiaries following the closing and, in certain cases,
obligations arising from certain liabilities, adverse reserve development and imposition of additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law. such
indemnification provisions generally are applicable from the closing date to the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations, although, in some cases, there may be agreed upon term limitations
or no term limitations. certain of these contingent obligations are subject to deductibles which have to be incurred by the obligee before the company is obligated to make payments. the maximum amount
of the company's contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of businesses that are quantifiable was $462million at december31, 2014, of which $8million was
recognized on the balance sheet at that date.
the
company also has contingent obligations for guarantees related to certain investments, third-party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of
former insurance subsidiaries, and various other indemnifications. the company also provides standard indemnifications to service providers in the normal course of business. the indemnification
clauses are often standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications have no stated or notional amounts or limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and,
accordingly, the company is unable to
develop an estimate of the maximum potential payments for such arrangements. the maximum amount of the company's obligation for guarantees of certain investments and third-party loans related to
certain investments that are quantifiable was $150million at december31, 2014, approximately $75million of which is indemnified by a third party. the maximum amount of the
company's obligation related to the guarantee of certain insurance policy obligations of a former insurance subsidiary was $480million at december31, 2014, all of which is indemnified
by a third party.

item9.changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure
not applicable.
item9a.controls and procedures
the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (exchange act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company's reports under the exchange act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission's rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. the company's management, with
the participation of the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures
as of december31, 2014. based upon that evaluation, the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of december31, 2014, the design and operation
of the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.
in
addition, there was no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the exchange act) that
occurred during the quarter ended december31, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.
table of contents
management's report on internal control over financial reporting
management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the
company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements of the company in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the company's accounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained
by management, are under the general oversight of the company's audit committee.
the
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company's management and directors; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management
has assessed the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2014. the standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are
the measures in the internal controlintegrated framework (2013) published by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway
commission.
based
upon its assessment, management has concluded that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at december31, 2014, and that there were no
material weaknesses in the company's internal control over financial reporting as of that date.
kpmgllp,
an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this form10-k, has issued
its report on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting which follows this report.

report of independent registered public accounting firm
the
board of directors and stockholders
the travelers companies,inc.:
we
have audited the travelers companies,inc. and subsidiaries' (the company) internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2014, based on criteria
established in the internal controlintegrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway
commission (coso). the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.
we
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in
our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2014, based on criteria established in the  internal controlintegrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
we
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheet of the travelers
companies,inc. and subsidiaries as of december31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december31, 2014, and our report dated february12, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

policies, and other trading restrictions" in the company's proxy statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on april11, 2014. from time to time, some of the company's
executives may determine that it is advisable to diversify their investments for personal financial planning reasons, or may seek liquidity for other reasons, and may sell shares of common stock of
the company in the open market, in private transactions or to the company. to effect such sales, some of the company's executives have entered into, and may in the future enter into, trading plans

the travelers companies,inc.  (parent company only)         notes to the condensed financial information of registrant
1.guarantees
in the ordinary course of selling businesses to third parties, the travelers companies,inc. (trv) has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising
out of breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the businesses being sold, covenants and obligations of trv and/or its subsidiaries following the closing, and in certain cases
obligations arising from certain liabilities or adverse reserve development. such indemnification provisions generally are applicable from the closing date to the expiration of the relevant statutes
of limitations, although, in some cases, there may be agreed upon term limitations or no term limitations. certain of these contingent obligations are subject to deductibles which have to be incurred
by the obligee before trv is obligated to make payments. the maximum amount of trv's contingent obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of businesses that are quantifiable was
$89million at december31, 2014, of which $8million was recognized on the balance sheet at that date.
trv
also has contingent obligations for guarantees related to its subsidiary's debt obligations and various other indemnifications. trv also provides standard indemnifications to service
providers in the normal course of business. the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications have no stated or notional amounts or
limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and, accordingly, trv is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential payments for such arrangements.
trv
fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment of all principal, premiums, if any, and interest on certain debt obligations of its subsidiaries tpc and travelers insurance group
holdingsinc. (tighi). the guarantees pertain to the $200million 7.75% notes due 2026 and the $500million 6.375% notes due 2033.
