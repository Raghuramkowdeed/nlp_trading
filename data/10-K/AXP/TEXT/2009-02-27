INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,

TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE COMPANY, WE, US OR OUR), IS A LEADING GLOBAL PAYMENTS AND TRAVEL COMPANY. OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CHARGE

AND CREDIT PAYMENT CARD PRODUCTS AND TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES OFFERED TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD. WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1850 AS A JOINT STOCK ASSOCIATION. WE WERE INCORPORATED IN 1965 AS A NEW YORK CORPORATION. AS DISCUSSED BELOW, ON

NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. (TRS), EACH BECAME BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 (THE

BHC ACT) SUBJECT TO THE SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE).

OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK IN LOWER MANHATTAN. WE ALSO HAVE OFFICES IN OTHER LOCATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF TWO CUSTOMER-FOCUSED GROUPSTHE GLOBAL CONSUMER GROUP AND THE GLOBAL BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS GROUP.

U.S. CARD SERVICES AND INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES ARE ALIGNED WITHIN THE GLOBAL CONSUMER GROUP AND GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES AND GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES ARE ALIGNED WITHIN THE GLOBAL BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS GROUP.

TABLE OF CONTENTS



NET INCOME OF $2.7 BILLION, DOWN 33% FROM $4.0 BILLION;



DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BASED ON INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $2.48, DOWN 28% FROM $3.45;



DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BASED ON NET INCOME OF $2.33, DOWN 31% FROM $3.36; AND



RETURN ON AVERAGE EQUITY OF 22.3%, COMPARED WITH 37.3%.

DURING THE LATTER HALF OF 2008, CONCERNS OVER THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT, A HISTORIC DECLINE IN REAL ESTATE VALUES IN THE UNITED STATES, RISING UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THE COLLAPSE OF MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

CONTRIBUTED TO A WORSENING GLOBAL RECESSION, INCREASED VOLATILITY AND REDUCED LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, AND DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED SLOWING CARDMEMBER SPENDING (INCLUDING A YEAR OVER YEAR DECLINE IN

SPENDING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE YEAR) AND LOAN VOLUMES AND HIGHER DELINQUENCIES AS INCREASING STRESS IN THE WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS ERODED CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE LEVELS. BASED ON THESE TRENDS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS CONSUMER AND

BUSINESS SENTIMENT WILL LIKELY DETERIORATE FURTHER AND WILL TRANSLATE INTO WEAKER ECONOMIES AROUND THE GLOBE AND INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT THROUGH 2009.

FOR A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF OUR 2008 FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING EACH OF OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS, SEE PAGES 12-119 OF OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH ARE

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. FOR A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND A DISCUSSION OF OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF REVENUE, SEE PAGES 12-15 AND PAGES 69-71, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BECAME BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT SUBJECT TO THE

SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE . EACH OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS ALSO ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT.

QUALIFYING AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY PROVIDES SEVERAL ADVANTAGES TO THE COMPANY. THE PRIMARY ADVANTAGE IS THAT THE COMPANY NOW HAS THE SAME STATUS AND REGULATOR AS A MAJORITY OF ITS PEERS. IT ALSO GIVES US ADDITIONAL

FLEXIBILITY DURING A TIME OF SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AND RAPID TRANSFORMATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. IN THIS RESPECT, BEING REGULATED AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY HAS PROVIDED A GREATER DEGREE OF CERTAINTY THAT WE ARE ELIGIBLE TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS INTRODUCED OR MAY INTRODUCE TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH GREATER ACCESS TO CAPITAL DURING THE CURRENT CREDIT MARKET CRISIS. FOR EXAMPLE, PURSUANT TO THE UNITED STATES

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURYS (THE TREASURY) CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM (CPP) UNDER THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008, WE ANNOUNCED ON JANUARY 9, 2009, THE RECEIPT OF AGGREGATE PROCEEDS OF $3.39 BILLION FROM THE

TREASURY IN EXCHANGE FOR THE SALE TO THE TREASURY OF (I) 3,388,890 SHARES OF OUR FIXED RATE CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES A, PAR VALUE $1.66 2/3 PER SHARE, HAVING A LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE PER SHARE EQUAL TO $1,000 AND

(II) A TEN-YEAR WARRANT (THE WARRANT) TO PURCHASE UP TO 24,264,129 OF OUR COMMON SHARES AT AN INITIAL PER SHARE EXERCISE PRICE OF $20.95 PER SHARE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION, PLEASE SEE OUR CURRENT REPORT ON

FORM 8-K FILED WITH THE SEC ON JANUARY 9, 2009.

AS A RESULT OF OUR TRANSITION TO A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION

BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL REGULATION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TWO U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON

OUR NON-BANKING ACTIVITIES UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVES REGULATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHANGE IN REGULATORY STATUS, PLEASE SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONGENERAL BEGINNING ON PAGE 34 BELOW.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

THE COMPANYS GLOBAL CONSUMER GROUP AND GLOBAL BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS GROUP PROVIDE A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WORLDWIDE.

THE GLOBAL CONSUMER GROUP OFFERS A RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDING.



CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES;



CONSUMER TRAVEL SERVICES; AND



STORED VALUE PRODUCTS SUCH AS TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID PRODUCTS.

THE GLOBAL BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS GROUP PROVIDES, AMONG OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.



BUSINESS TRAVEL, CORPORATE CARDS AND OTHER EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



NETWORK SERVICES FOR THE COMPANYS NETWORK PARTNERS; AND



MERCHANT ACQUISITION AND MERCHANT PROCESSING, POINT-OF-SALE, SERVICING AND SETTLEMENT AND MARKETING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WE HAVE GRANTED LICENSES TO PARTIALLY-OWNED AFFILIATES AND UNAFFILIATED ENTITIES TO OFFER SOME OF

THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

THE COMPANYS VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD GLOBALLY TO DIVERSE CUSTOMER GROUPS, INCLUDING

CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES, MIDDLE-MARKET COMPANIES, LARGE CORPORATIONS, AND BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD THROUGH VARIOUS CHANNELS INCLUDING DIRECT MAIL, THE INTERNET, EMPLOYEE AND INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY

SALES FORCES AND DIRECT RESPONSE ADVERTISING.

OUR GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK,

CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING AND PROCESSING BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL IN SCOPE. WE ARE A WORLD LEADER IN PROVIDING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. THESE CARDS INCLUDE CARDS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS AS

WELL AS CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (COLLECTIVELY, CARDS). OUR CARDS PERMIT OUR CARDMEMBERS (CARDMEMBERS) TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS AND

SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT THE MILLIONS OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO. WE ADDED A NET TOTAL OF 6 MILLION CARDS IN 2008, BRINGING TOTAL WORLDWIDE CARDS-IN-FORCE TO 92.4 MILLION (INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED

BY THIRD PARTIES). IN 2008, OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS (SPENDING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CARDS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS $683.3 BILLION.

OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, ALTHOUGH TRAVEL

SALES GENERALLY TEND TO BE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS. TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES OUTSTANDING TEND TO BE GREATEST EACH YEAR IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD QUARTER. AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

GIFT CARD SALES ARE HIGHEST IN THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER; AND CARD BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS.

SPEND-CENTRIC MODEL IS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

DESPITE

THE CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, WE BELIEVE OUR SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS MODEL (WHICH FOCUSES ON GENERATING REVENUES PRIMARILY BY DRIVING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND SECONDARILY BY FINANCE CHARGES AND FEES) CONTINUES TO

GIVE US SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES, EVEN WHEN THE OVERALL SPENDING LEVEL IS DOWN. AVERAGE SPENDING ON OUR CARDS, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER FOR US VERSUS OUR COMPETITORS, REPRESENTS GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN THE FORM OF LOYAL

CUSTOMERS AND HIGHER SALES. THIS ENABLES US TO EARN A PREMIUM DISCOUNT RATE AND THEREBY INVEST IN GREATER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS. AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER REVENUES GENERATED FROM HIGHER SPENDING, WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY

TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE REWARDS,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER INCENTIVES TO CARDMEMBERS AND TARGETED MARKETING PROGRAMS FOR MERCHANTS, WHICH IN TURN CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR CARDMEMBERS TO SPEND MORE ON THEIR

CARDS. THIS BUSINESS MODEL, ALONG WITH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, IN WHICH WE ARE BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WE SEEK TO LEVERAGE TO PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS,

MERCHANTS AND CARD-ISSUING PARTNERS.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTESTRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY, QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICEARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR BRAND BY EDUCATING EMPLOYEES ABOUT THESE ATTRIBUTES AND BY

INCORPORATING THEM INTO OUR PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR BRAND HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN RATED ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE BRANDS IN THE WORLD IN PUBLISHED STUDIES, AND WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE BELIEVE

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS, AND WE INVEST HEAVILY IN MANAGING, MARKETING AND PROMOTING IT. (MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES ARE REFLECTED IN EACH SEGMENT BASED ON ACTUAL EXPENSES INCURRED,

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BRAND ADVERTISING, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES SEGMENT.) IN ADDITION, WE PLACE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS AND PATENTS, AND DILIGENTLY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES

THE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES (GNMS) SEGMENT OPERATES A GLOBAL GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK FOR BOTH

PROPRIETARY CARDS AND CARDS ISSUED UNDER NETWORK LICENSING AGREEMENTS. IT ALSO MANAGES MERCHANT SERVICES GLOBALLY, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS AS WELL AS PROCESSING AND SETTLING CARD TRANSACTIONS FOR THOSE MERCHANTS. THIS

SEGMENT ALSO OFFERS MERCHANTS POINT-OF-SALE, SERVICING AND SETTLEMENT AND MARKETING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE

ISSUED BY OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, TRS, THE COMPANYS U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES, AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK (CENTURION BANK) AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB (AEBFSB), AND ALSO BY THIRD-PARTY INSTITUTIONS.

THEY ARE ACCEPTED AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED AT ATM LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT CARDS. TRS AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE THE VAST MAJORITY OF CARDS ON OUR NETWORK.

OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES (GNS) BUSINESS ESTABLISHES AND

MAINTAINS RELATIONSHIPS WITH ISSUERS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ISSUE CARDS AND, IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, ACQUIRE LOCAL MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GNS IS KEY TO OUR STRATEGY OF BROADENING THE CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT

BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE.

OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES (GMS) BUSINESS PROVIDES US WITH ACCESS TO RICH TRANSACTION DATA

THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, WHICH ENCOMPASSES RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THE CARDMEMBER AND THE MERCHANT. THIS CAPABILITY HELPS US ACQUIRE NEW MERCHANTS, DEEPEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING MERCHANTS, PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, AND PROVIDE TARGETED

MARKETING AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS IN OUR NETWORK.

A KEY ASSET OF OUR NETWORK IS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WHICH IS

ONE OF THE WORLDS MOST HIGHLY RECOGNIZED AND RESPECTED BRANDS.

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE A STRATEGY, THROUGH OUR GNS BUSINESS, OF INVITING U.S. AND FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE CARDS ON THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS NETWORK. BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WE BROADEN OUR CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. THE GNS BUSINESS HAS ESTABLISHED MORE THAN 128 CARD-ISSUING AND/OR

MERCHANT-ACQUIRING ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN 127 COUNTRIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HISTORICALLY, WE HAD SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED OUR GNS BUSINESS STRATEGY IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES. IN CONTRAST TO THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, UNTIL 2004 NO MAJOR U.S. BANKS HAD ISSUED CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL NETWORK. THIS SITUATION WAS THE RESULT OF RULES AND POLICIES OF VISA INC.,

VISA USA, AND VISA INTERNATIONAL (COLLECTIVELY VISA) AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC. (MASTERCARD) IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE TIME, WHICH MANDATED EXPULSION OF MEMBERS THAT ISSUED AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. THESE

RULES WERE STRUCK DOWN IN 2004 IN A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION, BEGINNING IN 2004, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXTEND OUR NETWORK TO OTHER CARD ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES, JUST AS WE HAVE DONE

INTERNATIONALLY. (YOU CAN READ ABOUT OUR LAWSUIT AND SETTLEMENTS WITH VISA AND MASTERCARD RELATING TO THEIR RULES AND POLICIES IN THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS SECTION OF THIS REPORT UNDER ITEM 3 BELOW.)

IN 2008, GNS SIGNED 13 NEW PARTNERS TO ISSUE CARDS AND/OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. ADDITIONALLY, GNS PARTNERS LAUNCHED 130 NEW

PRODUCTS DURING 2008, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS PARTNER PRODUCTS TO APPROXIMATELY 930.

GNS FOCUSES ON

PARTNERING WITH QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT CHOOSE TO ISSUE CARDS ACCEPTED ON OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. ALTHOUGH WE CUSTOMIZE OUR NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS TO THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND EACH PARTNERS REQUIREMENTS, AS

WELL AS TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANS IN THAT MARKETPLACE, ALL GNS ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ISSUERS DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR THEIR HIGHEST-SPENDING AND MOST AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND TO SUPPORT THE VALUE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MERCHANTS.

WE CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT SHARE A CORE SET OF ATTRIBUTES COMPATIBLE WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, SUCH AS COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS AND STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND WE REQUIRE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRODUCT, BRAND AND

SERVICE STANDARDS.*

WITH APPROXIMATELY 930 DIFFERENT CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED ON OUR NETWORK SO FAR BY OUR PARTNERS, GNS IS AN INCREASINGLY

IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT IS STRENGTHENING OUR BRAND VISIBILITY AROUND THE WORLD, DRIVING MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO OUR MERCHANT NETWORK AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. GNS ENABLES US TO EXPAND OUR

NETWORKS GLOBAL PRESENCE WITHOUT ASSUMING ADDITIONAL CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK OR HAVING TO INVEST A LARGE NUMBER OF RESOURCES, AS OUR GNS PARTNERS ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED ATTRACTIVE CUSTOMER BASES THEY CAN TARGET WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED

PRODUCTS, AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CARDS THEY ISSUE. SINCE 1999, CARDS-IN-FORCE ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS HAVE GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 27%, AND TOTALED ALMOST 25 MILLION CARDS AT THE

END OF 2008. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, 68% OF NEW CARDS ISSUED IN 2008 WERE CARDS ISSUED BY ONE OF OUR GNS PARTNERS. SPENDING ON THESE GNS CARDS HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE OF 27% SINCE 1999. YEAR OVER YEAR SPENDING GROWTH IN 2008 WAS 27%,

WITH TOTAL SPENDING EQUAL TO $67 BILLION.

GNS ARRANGEMENTS

ALTHOUGH THE STRUCTURES AND DETAILS OF EACH OF THE GNS ARRANGEMENTS VARY, ALL OF THEM GENERATE REVENUES FOR US FROM THE CARD TRANSACTION VOLUMES THEY DRIVE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GROSS REVENUES WE RECEIVE

PER DOLLAR SPENT ON A CARD ISSUED BY A GNS PARTNER ARE LOWER THAN THOSE FROM OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GNS PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE OPERATING COSTS AND RISK OF ITS CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, OUR OPERATING

EXPENSES AND CREDIT LOSSES ARE LOWER THAN THOSE IN OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. THE GNS BUSINESS MODEL GENERATES AN ATTRACTIVE EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE THAT REQUIRES A LOWER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SUPPORT. THE RETURN ON EQUITY IN OUR GNS

BUSINESS CAN THUS BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE MAJORITY OF GNS COSTS ARE FIXED, THE GNS BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SCALABLE. GNS PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS BRAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND AND DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS WITH INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.

*

THE USE OF THE TERM PARTNER OR PARTNERING DOES NOT MEAN OR IMPLY A FORMAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP, AND IS NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY TO ALTER THE TERMS OF AMERICAN

EXPRESSS RELATIONSHIP WITH THIRD-PARTY ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS FALL INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE MAIN CATEGORIES: INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS,

NETWORK CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS AND JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS.

INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS

THE FIRST TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS AN INDEPENDENT OPERATOR (IO) ARRANGEMENT. AS OF THE END OF 2008, WE HAD 64 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS

AROUND THE WORLD. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO EXPAND THE PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE DO NOT OFFER A PROPRIETARY LOCAL CURRENCY CARD. THE PARTNERS LOCAL PRESENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS HELP US ENHANCE THE

IMPACT OF OUR BRAND IN THE MARKET, REACH MERCHANT COVERAGE GOALS MORE QUICKLY, AND OPERATE AT ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. SUBJECT TO MEETING OUR STANDARDS, WE LICENSE OUR IO BANK PARTNERS TO

ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS IN THEIR MARKETS, INCLUDING THE CLASSIC GREEN, GOLD AND PLATINUM AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF THESE PARTNERS SERVE AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR FOR LOCAL MERCHANTS. AMERICAN EXPRESS

RETAINS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MULTINATIONAL MERCHANTS. OUR IO PARTNERS OWN THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIT RISK FOR THE CARDS THEY ISSUE, AND MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL BE ISSUED CARDS. GNS GENERATES REVENUES IN IO

ARRANGEMENTS FROM CARD LICENSING FEES, ROYALTIES ON CARDMEMBER BILLINGS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONVERSION REVENUE, ROYALTIES ON CHARGE VOLUME AT MERCHANTS, DISCOUNT REVENUE AND, IN SOME PARTNERSHIPS, ROYALTIES ON NET SPREAD REVENUE. OUR IO PARTNERS ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, BILLING AND PRICING, CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT SERVICING, AND FUNDING CARD RECEIVABLES FOR THEIR CARDS AND PAYABLES FOR THEIR MERCHANTS.

WE BEAR THE RISK ARISING FROM THE IO PARTNERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH

INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, WE GENERALLY REQUIRE IO PARTNERS TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE ENTERED INTO IO ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE BRAZIL, RUSSIA, CHINA, ECUADOR, GREECE, SOUTH KOREA, PAKISTAN, CROATIA, PERU, PORTUGAL AND VIETNAM. THROUGH OUR IO PARTNERSHIPS, WE BELIEVE WE

CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH IN CARDMEMBER SPENDING, CARDS-IN-FORCE AND MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE IN THESE COUNTRIES.

NETWORK CARD LICENSE

ARRANGEMENTS

THE SECOND TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS A NETWORK CARD LICENSE (NCL). AT THE END OF 2008, WE HAD 60 OF

THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE WORLDWIDE. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO INCREASE OUR BRAND PRESENCE AND GAIN MARKET SHARE IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE A PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING AND/OR MERCHANT ACQUIRING BUSINESS AND, IN A FEW CASES, THOSE IN WHICH WE

HAVE IO PARTNERS. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, WE GRANT THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION A LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. THE NCL ISSUER OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS FOR ALL CARDS IT ISSUES, PROVIDES CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ITS

CARDMEMBERS, AUTHORIZES TRANSACTIONS, MANAGES BILLING AND CREDIT, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MARKETING THE CARDS, AND DESIGNS CARD PRODUCT FEATURES (INCLUDING REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR CARDMEMBERS), SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS. WE OPERATE

THE MERCHANT NETWORK, ROUTE AND PROCESS CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANTS POINT-OF-SALE THROUGH SUBMISSION TO THE ISSUER, AND SETTLE WITH ISSUERS. THE NCL IS THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED WITH BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES.

GNS REVENUES IN NCL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING, ROYALTIES, CURRENCY

CONVERSIONS AND LICENSING FEES PAID BY THE PARTNER AND FEES CHARGED TO THE CARD ISSUER BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, AND OUR PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SUCH AS CARDMEMBER INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER CARD FEATURES AND BENEFITS FOR THE ISSUERS

CARDS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THE NCL ISSUER BEARS THE CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL AS THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION COSTS, CARDMEMBER FRAUD RISKS AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND OTHER LOYALTY INITIATIVES. WE BEAR THE RISK ARISING FROM THE

NCL PARTNERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US

AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, WE GENERALLY REQUIRE NCL ISSUERS TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

EXAMPLES OF NCL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N.A. AND BANK OF AMERICA IN THE UNITED STATES, LLOYDS TSB BANK IN

THE UNITED KINGDOM AND WESTPAC BANKING CORPORATION IN AUSTRALIA.

JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS

THE THIRD TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS A JOINT VENTURE (JV) ARRANGEMENT. WE HAVE UTILIZED THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT IN SWITZERLAND, BELGIUM AND

IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IN THESE MARKETS, WE JOIN WITH A THIRD PARTY TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN WHICH WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP STAKE. THE JV TYPICALLY SIGNS NEW MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND ISSUES LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS

THAT CARRY OUR LOGO. IN A JV ARRANGEMENT, THE JV ASSUMES THE CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK AND BEARS THE OPERATING AND MARKETING COSTS. UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO TYPES OF GNS ARRANGEMENTS, WE SHARE MANAGEMENT, RISK, AND PROFIT AND LOSS RESPONSIBILITY WITH OUR

JV PARTNERS. INCOME IS GENERATED BY DISCOUNT REVENUES, CARD FEES AND NET SPREAD REVENUES. THE ECONOMICS OF THE JV ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, WHICH WE DISCUSS UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES, AND WE RECEIVE A

PORTION OF THE JVS INCOME DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST. OUR SUBSIDIARY, AEOCC MANAGEMENT COMPANY, LTD., PURCHASES CARD RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF THE GNS JVS FROM TIME TO TIME.

GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES

WE OPERATE A GMS BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS, ACCEPTING AND PROCESSING CARD TRANSACTIONS, AND PAYING MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS FOR PURCHASES MADE BY CARDMEMBERS WITH CARDS (CHARGES). WE ALSO

PROVIDE MARKETING SERVICES AND PROGRAMS TO MERCHANTS, LEVERAGING THE CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY OUR CLOSED-LOOP STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS POINT-OF-SALE PRODUCTS AND SERVICING AND SETTLEMENT.

OUR OBJECTIVES ARE FOR CARDMEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE CARD WHEREVER AND HOWEVER THEY DESIRE, AND TO INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

AND IN SELECTED NEW INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED GENERAL-PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT. WE ADD NEW MERCHANTS TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER OF SALES CHANNELS: A PROPRIETARY SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY SALES

AND SERVICE AGENTS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH BANKS AND PROCESSORS, THE INTERNET, TELEMARKETING AND INBOUND WANT TO HONOR CALLS (I.E., MERCHANTS DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD CONTACTING US DIRECTLY).

AS DISCUSSED IN THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES SECTION, OUR IO PARTNERS AND JVS ALSO ADD NEW LOCAL MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

DURING 2008, WE CONTINUED EXPANDING OUR INTEGRATED AMERICAN EXPRESS

ONEPOINT

SM

SOLUTION FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE AGENTS PROVIDE PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES TO

MERCHANTS ON OUR BEHALF FOR CARD TRANSACTIONS, WHILE WE RETAIN THE ACCEPTANCE CONTRACT WITH PARTICIPATING MERCHANTS, ESTABLISH MERCHANT PRICING AND RECEIVE THE SAME TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION WE ALWAYS HAVE RECEIVED. THIS PROGRAM SIMPLIFIES CARD

PROCESSING FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH A SINGLE SOURCE FOR STATEMENTS, SETTLEMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.

SINCE THE EARLY 1990S, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE

USE OF OUR CARDS FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 64% OF OUR U.S. BILLINGS CAME FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 36% CAME FROM RETAIL AND OTHER SECTORS. THAT PROPORTION HAS NOW BEEN MORE THAN REVERSED. IN 2008, U.S. NON-TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT BILLINGS REPRESENTED OVER 70% OF THE U.S. BILLED BUSINESS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. THIS SHIFT RESULTED FROM THE GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS THAT BEGAN TO ACCEPT CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS

INCREASED DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR MORE OF THEIR PURCHASES, AND OUR FOCUS ON EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MEET CARDMEMBERS NEEDS.

DURING 2008, WE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO USE THE CARD FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF MERCHANTS IN RETAIL AND EVERYDAY SPENDING CATEGORIES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD, SUCH AS QUICK-SERVE

RESTAURANTS, MASS TRANSIT, HEALTHCARE AND RECURRING BILLING MERCHANTS. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2008, WE ANNOUNCED CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES WITH.



FRESH & EASY NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET, A COMPANY OF TESCO, TO ACCEPT THE CARD AT OVER 100 FRESH & EASY STORES IN CALIFORNIA, ARIZONA AND NEVADA;



FRYS ELECTRONICS, INC. TO ACCEPT THE CARD AT ALL 34 FRYS STORES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON ITS WEB SITE; AND



PUBLIC MASS-TRANSIT SYSTEMS SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY (SEPTA) AND BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT (BART).

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE SIGNED CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH.



RBS INSURANCE GROUP OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, TO ACCEPT THE CARD FOR CERTAIN LINES OF INSURANCE;



MCDONALDS, TO ACCEPT THE CARD AT ITS 780 RESTAURANTS ACROSS AUSTRALIA;



UNICOOP FIRENZE SC, TO ACCEPT THE CARD AT SEVEN OF ITS HYPERMARKETS IN ITALY; AND



CHRISTIES, TO ACCEPT THE CARD AT ITS AUCTIONS IN HONG KONG.

IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUED OUR DRIVE TO BRING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO INDUSTRIES WHERE CASH OR CHECKS ARE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF PAYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE MADE HEADWAY IN PROMOTING CARD ACCEPTANCE FOR GLOBAL

BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS PAYMENTS IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS PHARMACEUTICALS, WHOLESALE FOODS, BIOTECHNOLOGY, CONSTRUCTION, INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WERE SIGNED IN 2008 IN THE UNITED STATES WITH WHOLESALE HOME PRODUCTS

AND IMPROVEMENT COMPANIES SUCH AS LANSING BUILDING PRODUCTS, DAL-TILE CORP., LUX HOME INC., AND SPRING AIR, AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS MANUFACTURER, ACME BRICK COMPANY. INTERNATIONALLY, A CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED WITH CEVA LOGISTICS, A

WAREHOUSING, TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS COMPANY IN AUSTRALIA. AS WE PENETRATE THESE INDUSTRIES, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE CARDMEMBER SPENDING.

GLOBALLY, ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS CONTINUES TO INCREASE. AS IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2008, WE CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE OF CARDS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO REFINE OUR APPROACH TO

CALCULATING MERCHANT COVERAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT, AS OF THE END OF 2008, OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN 90% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARD SPENDING, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT NETWORK AS A WHOLE ACCOMMODATED APPROXIMATELY 80% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE BASED ON COMPARING OUR CARDMEMBERS SPENDING

ON OUR NETWORK CURRENTLY WITH OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT OUR CARDMEMBERS WOULD SPEND ON OUR NETWORK IF ALL MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT GENERAL-PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS ACCEPTED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

WE EARN DISCOUNT REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AS PAYMENT FOR GOODS OR SERVICES SOLD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS

THE FEE CHARGED TO THE MERCHANT FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AND IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE AMOUNT CHARGED ON A CARD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT THAT THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER (IN

MOST CASES, TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) PAYS TO A MERCHANT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE MERCHANT, ACCEPTS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANT, PAYS THE MERCHANT FOR THESE

TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, WHICH SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE CARD ISSUER. WHEN A CARDMEMBER PRESENTS THE CARD FOR PAYMENT, THE MERCHANT CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR THE TRANSACTION

AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE TIME THE TRANSACTION IS RECEIVED BY US FROM THE

MERCHANT.

WHERE WE ACT AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE CARD PRESENTED AT A MERCHANT IS ISSUED BY A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF OUR GNS PARTNERS, WE WILL MAKE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT TO THE MERCHANT AND RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT REVENUE. IN OUR ROLE AS THE OPERATOR OF THE CARD NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO RECEIVE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT FROM THE CARD

ISSUER, WHO RECEIVES AN ISSUER RATE (I.E., THE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AMOUNT THAT CARD ISSUERS RECEIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS CHARGED ON OUR NETWORK WITH CARDS THEY ISSUE, WHICH IS USUALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGED AMOUNT). THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT REVENUE (RECEIVED BY US IN THE FORM OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT) AND THE ISSUER RATE RECEIVED BY THE CARD ISSUER GENERATES A RETURN TO US. IN CASES WHERE AMERICAN EXPRESS IS THE CARD ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A

THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (WHICH CAN BE THE CASE IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH THE IO IS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER), WE RECEIVE AN INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED ISSUER RATE IN OUR SETTLEMENT WITH THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WHICH IS RECORDED BY US AS

DISCOUNT REVENUE. BY CONTRAST WITH NETWORKS SUCH AS VISA AND MASTERCARD, THERE IS NO COLLECTIVELY-SET INTERCHANGE RATE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMS DEPICT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE PARTIES IN A POINT-OF-SALE TRANSACTION EFFECTED

ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK WHERE WE ACT AS BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND MERCHANT ACQUIRER (THE 3-PARTY MODEL) AND UNDER AN NCL ARRANGEMENT WHERE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACT AS CARD ISSUERS (THE NCL MODEL).

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE WE CHARGE IS PRINCIPALLY DETERMINED BY THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO THE MERCHANT AND

GENERALLY REPRESENTS A PREMIUM OVER OTHER NETWORKS. WE DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS RELATIVE TO USERS OF CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETING CARD NETWORKS, MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND CARDMEMBERS INSISTENCE ON

USING THEIR CARDS WHEN ENROLLED IN REWARDS OR OTHER CARD LOYALTY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE PART OF OUR CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM.

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE VARIES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WITH THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE MERCHANT DOES BUSINESS, THE MERCHANTS CHARGE VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT TO THE MERCHANT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN

CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF THE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH US (LOCAL OR GLOBAL) AND THE CHARGE AMOUNT.

IN 2008,

AS IN PRIOR YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SOME REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING THE NET IMPACT OF SELECTIVE REPRICING INITIATIVES, CHANGES IN THE MIX OF BUSINESS, REGIONAL MARKET PRESSURES AND

VOLUME-RELATED PRICING ADJUSTMENTS. WE EXPECT THAT THE EFFECT OF THESE FACTORS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN SOME EROSION OVER TIME OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE, PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WHILE MOST MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS UNDERSTAND OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE PRICING IN RELATION TO THE VALUE PROVIDED, WE DO ENCOUNTER A RELATIVELY

SMALL NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, BUT TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER TO ACCEPT ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT AND, CONSEQUENTLY, SUPPRESS USE OF THE CARD. SUBJECT TO LOCAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, WE RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE VIGOROUSLY TO

ENSURE THAT OUR CARDMEMBERS ARE ABLE TO USE THEIR CARD WHERE AND WHEN THEY WANT TO AND TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND. WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS BY

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONCENTRATING ON ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD; CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE PROVIDE TO MERCHANTS THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS

MY WISHLIST AND AMERICAN EXPRESS SELECTS

®

, WHICH ENABLE MERCHANTS TO GAIN VALUABLE EXPOSURE AND ADDITIONAL SALES BY PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE OFFERS AND EXPERIENCES TO AMERICAN EXPRESS

CARDMEMBERS; DEVELOPING NEW AND INNOVATIVE BUSINESS INSIGHTS USING INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK; PROVIDING BETTER AND EARLIER COMMUNICATION OF OUR VALUE PROPOSITION; AND, WHEN APPROPRIATE, CANCELLING MERCHANTS WHO SUPPRESS

THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

IN THE CASE OF MY WISHLIST, A POPULAR SEASONAL LIMITED E-TAIL WEB SITE WE DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED STATES, WE

PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO BUY A LIMITED NUMBER OF SOUGHT-AFTER ITEMS, SUCH AS AUTOMOBILES, ELECTRONICS, JEWELRY, AND ATTRACTIVE TRAVEL AND LIFESTYLE EXPERIENCES, AT A SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT FROM THEIR RETAIL PRICES, IN ADDITION TO

ACCESS TO NUMEROUS OFFERS FROM TOP BRANDS. THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS SELECTS, WE MAKE AVAILABLE TO OUR CARDMEMBERS HIGH QUALITY SHOPPING, DINING AND TRAVEL VALUES FROM MERCHANTS ALL OVER THE WORLD. AMERICAN EXPRESS SELECTS IS A GLOBAL PLATFORM

AVAILABLE TO AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS AND MERCHANTS THAT ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO ENJOY SPECIAL OFFERS FROM MERCHANTS WITHOUT COMPROMISING THEIR PRIVACY.

MERCHANT SATISFACTION IS A KEY GOAL OF OUR GMS BUSINESS. WE FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MERCHANT SATISFACTION, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND EXECUTING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD

USAGE AT MERCHANTS, USING TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES, ENHANCING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND MERCHANTS EASE OF DOING BUSINESS WITH US, MAKING OUR U.S. OPERATING PROCEDURES EASILY AVAILABLE TO MERCHANTS ON OUR WEB SITE, APPLYING OUR CLOSED-LOOP

CAPABILITIES AND DEEP MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS THROUGH AN EXPANDING ROSTER OF SERVICES THAT HELPS THEM MEET THEIR BUSINESS GOALS.

WE ALSO OFFER OUR MERCHANT CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE OF POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATED POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS, SOFTWARE, ONLINE SOLUTIONS,

AND DIRECT LINKS THAT ALLOW MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS (AS WELL AS CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON OTHER NETWORKS AND CHECKS). VIRTUALLY ALL PROPRIETARY POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS SUPPORT DIRECT PROCESSING (I.E., DIRECT CONNECTIVITY)

TO AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH CAN LOWER A MERCHANTS COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE AND ENHANCE PAYMENT EFFICIENCY.

EXPRESSPAY FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

, A CONTACTLESS PAYMENT FEATURE, IS DESIGNED TO BE A FAST, EASY-TO-USE ALTERNATIVE FOR MAKING EVERYDAY PURCHASES AT

MERCHANTS WHERE SPEED AND CONVENIENCE IS IMPORTANT. EXPRESSPAY IS ACCEPTED AT MORE THAN 30,000 LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING TOP QUICK-SERVICE RESTAURANT, MOVIE THEATER, DRUG STORE AND CONVENIENCE STORE AND MAJOR RETAIL CHAINS.

EXPRESSPAY, POWERED BY RADIO-FREQUENCY TECHNOLOGY, IS CURRENTLY EMBEDDED WITHIN SEVERAL CARD PRODUCTS. IN 2008, WE EXPANDED THE LIST OF MERCHANTS WHERE EXPRESSPAY CAN BE USED TO INCLUDE PARADISE SHOPS, UNIVERSAL ORLANDO RESORT AND HESS. IN EARLY

2008, AFTER A STRATEGIC REVIEW OF THE EXPRESSPAY PORTFOLIO, WE DECIDED TO DISCONTINUE THE EXPRESSPAY KEY FOB AND FOCUS RESOURCES ON DEVELOPING EXPRESSPAY ON OUR CARD PORTFOLIOS AND MOBILE PHONES. ALL EXPRESSPAY KEY FOBS WERE DEACTIVATED IN 2008.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON THE RECURRING BILLING INDUSTRY THROUGH AUTOMATIC BILL PAYMENT, A SERVICE THAT ALLOWS MERCHANTS TO BILL

CARDMEMBERS ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR RECURRING CHARGES SUCH AS INSURANCE PREMIUMS, NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTIONS, HEALTH CLUB MEMBERSHIPS, COMMUTATION COSTS AND CABLE TELEVISION SERVICE. WE HAVE ALSO MADE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR HOST AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM TO

APPROVE MORE TRANSACTIONS AND REDUCE CARDMEMBER INCONVENIENCE AT THE POINT-OF-SALE WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN FRAUD OR CREDIT LOSSES.

WHEREVER WE MANAGE BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS AND THE CARD-ISSUING SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A CLOSED-LOOP, WHICH DISTINGUISHES OUR NETWORK FROM THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, IN THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO

INFORMATION AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD TRANSACTION. WE MAINTAIN DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH OUR CARDMEMBERS AND OUR MERCHANTS, AND WE HANDLE ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. OUR RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW US TO ANALYZE INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER

SPEND. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. WE PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS DATA,

AND COMPLY WITH STRICT PRIVACY, FIREWALL AND APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING BANK PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN KEY ELEMENTS OF

THIS CLOSED-LOOP, WHICH PERMITS THEM TO CUSTOMIZE MARKETING EFFORTS, DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO THEIR CARDMEMBERS AND HELP US TO DIRECT INCREASED BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT THE CARD.

AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WE HAVE CERTAIN EXPOSURES THAT ARISE IF A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE

CARDMEMBER. DRIVERS OF THIS LIABILITY ARE RETURNS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER FRAUDULENT CHARGES, THE QUALITY OR NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, WE OFFSET THE AMOUNT DUE TO THE CARDMEMBER AGAINST

PAYMENTS FOR THE MERCHANTS CURRENT OR FUTURE CHARGE SUBMISSIONS. WE CAN REALIZE LOSSES WHEN A MERCHANTS OFFSETTING CHARGE SUBMISSIONS CEASE, SUCH AS WHEN THE MERCHANT COMMENCES A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY

MONITOR OUR MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE RISK OF THIS EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN MERCHANT BY REQUIRING A PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE OR LETTER OF CREDIT, HOLDING CASH RESERVES FUNDED THROUGH

CHARGE PAYABLE HOLDBACKS FROM A MERCHANT, LENGTHENING THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE MERCHANT SUBMITS A CHARGE FOR PAYMENT AND WHEN WE PAY THE MERCHANT OR IMPLEMENTING OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS. WE ALSO ESTABLISH RESERVES ON OUR BALANCE

SHEET FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES.

WITH THE INCREASE IN ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION DATA OVER MERCHANTS

POINT-OF-SALE SYSTEMS, AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THE OTHER MAJOR CARD NETWORKS RECOGNIZED THE NECESSITY FOR MERCHANTS AND MERCHANT PROCESSORS TO SECURE THIS DATA AGAINST ACCIDENTAL OR INTENTIONAL COMPROMISE USING A STANDARD PROTOCOL THAT APPLIES TO ALL

CARD TYPES. IN 2006, IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE SECURITY PRACTICES OF MERCHANTS AND PAYMENT PROCESSING FIRMS AND TO SECURE PAYMENT ACCOUNT DATA IN A GLOBALLY CONSISTENT MANNER, WE AND DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, JCB, MASTERCARD WORLDWIDE AND VISA

FORMED PCI SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL, LLC (PCI SSC), AN INDEPENDENT STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION. PCI SSCS ROLE IS TO MANAGE THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY (PCI) DATA SECURITY STANDARD, AND MORE RECENTLY THE PCI PIN ENTRY DEVICE

(PED) SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AND THE PAYMENT APPLICATION DATA SECURITY STANDARD, WHICH FOCUS ON IMPROVING PAYMENT CARD ACCOUNT SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE TRANSACTION PROCESS. BY ESTABLISHING PCI SSC, WE AND THE OTHER FOUNDERS HAVE DEVELOPED COMMON

STANDARDS THAT ARE MORE ACCESSIBLE AND EFFICIENT FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY. ALL OUR MERCHANTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT STORE, PROCESS AND TRANSMIT PAYMENT CARD DATA ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD.

PCI SSC IS DEDICATED TO DRIVING GREATER EDUCATION, AWARENESS AND ADOPTION OF THESE SECURITY STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THE PAYMENT PROCESS CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY.

IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA, THIRD-PARTY PROCESSORS AND SOME BANKCARD ACQUIRERS HAVE BEGUN TO OFFER MERCHANTS THE

CAPABILITY OF CONVERTING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF THE CARDHOLDERS RESIDENCE (I.E., THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE POINT-OF-SALE, AND SUBMITTING THE TRANSACTION IN THE CARDHOLDERS

BILLING CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS OF THE CARD NETWORK. THIS PRACTICE IS KNOWN AS DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION. IF A MERCHANT UTILIZES A DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS, THE MERCHANT

AND PROCESSOR SHARE ANY FEE ASSESSED OR SPREAD EARNED FOR CONVERTING THE TRANSACTION AT THE POINT-OF-SALE, THUS REDUCING OR ELIMINATING REVENUE FOR CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CHARGES TO THE CARDHOLDERS

BILLING CURRENCY. THIS PRACTICE IS NOT WIDESPREAD, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT CONSUMERS WILL PREFER TO HAVE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS CONVERTED BY MERCHANTS IN THIS WAY. OUR POLICY GENERALLY REQUIRES MERCHANTS TO SUBMIT CHARGES AND BE

PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND WE CONVERT THE TRANSACTION TO THE CARDMEMBERS BILLING CURRENCY.

GLOBAL

NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICESCOMPETITION

OUR GLOBAL CARD NETWORK, INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES AND GLOBAL

NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESSES, COMPETES WITH OTHER CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB (WHICH WAS ACQUIRED BY DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES), DISCOVER (PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES), AND JCB CO.,

LTD. (PRIMARILY IN ASIA). WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST MARKETS. IN ADDITION, APART FROM SUCH NETWORK SERVICES, A

RANGE OF COMPANIES GLOBALLY, INCLUDING MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND PROCESSORS, CARRY OUT SOME

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO CERTAIN ACTIVITIES PERFORMED BY OUR GMS AND GNS BUSINESSES. NO SINGLE ENTITY PARTICIPATES ON A GLOBAL BASIS IN THE FULL RANGE OF

ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ENCOMPASSED BY OUR CLOSED-LOOP BUSINESS MODEL.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK AND MERCHANT

SERVICE BUSINESSES INCLUDE.



THE NUMBER OF CARDS-IN-FORCE AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THESE CARDS;



THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THE CARDS CAN BE USED;



THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS OF PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK;



THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS;



REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION;



INNOVATION IN SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS;



THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE;



THE SECURITY OF CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT INFORMATION;



THE IMPACT OF EXISTING LITIGATION, LEGISLATION AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION; AND



COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE RELATIVE TO THE VALUE PROVIDED.

ANOTHER ASPECT OF NETWORK COMPETITION IS THE RECENT EMERGENCE AND RAPID GROWTH OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDE AGGREGATORS (SUCH AS PAYPAL), WIRELESS PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING

MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO CREDIT CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES CONTINUE TO EMERGE THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT ONLINE CUSTOMERS TO

PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH (AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE, I.E., INTER-BANK TRANSFER), AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS

ONLINE.

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE OUR CLOSED-LOOP STRUCTURE, SUCH AS VISA, WITH ITS VISA INCENTIVE NETWORK.

ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE VISA WILL BE, EFFORTS BY VISA AND OTHER CARD NETWORKS AND PAYMENT PROVIDERS TO REPLICATE THE CLOSED-LOOP SPEAK TO ITS CONTINUED VALUE AND TO THE INTENSE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICESREGULATION

LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING GNS ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND

INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CARDS AND, IN THE CASE OF OUR IO ARRANGEMENTS, TO OPERATE MERCHANT-ACQUIRING BUSINESSES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR GNS PARTNERS HAVE GENERALLY NOT HAD DIFFICULTY OBTAINING APPROPRIATE

GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO GNS ARRANGEMENTS. AS A NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDER TO REGULATED U.S. BANKS, OUR GNS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CERTAIN FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL

RESERVE, THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC), THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION. AS THE OPERATOR OF A GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS

OF THE CURRENCY AND FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS REPORTING ACT AND THE ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE BANK SECRECY ACT), AS AMENDED BY THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE

PATRIOT ACT). WE CONDUCT DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR GNS PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) CONTROLS TO PREVENT OUR NETWORK FROM BEING USED FOR MONEY LAUNDERING OR

TERRORIST FINANCING PURPOSES. AS A RESULT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BECOMING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FURTHER REGULATION AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT

THIS CHANGE IN REGULATORY STATUS, PLEASE SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONGENERAL BEGINNING ON PAGE 34 BELOW.

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES

INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, POLAND, GERMANY, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), AUSTRALIA, MEXICO, AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED

INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING OR ON APPEAL. THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD, IS

GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR BANKCARD DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS.

BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE COLLECTIVELY-SET INTERCHANGE FEES.

ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS AND THEIR OPERATIONS ON A MULTILATERAL BASIS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE BANKCARD ASSOCIATIONS PRICING

COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE FROM CONSUMERS SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY

SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE ANTITRUST ACTIONS OR REGULATIONS HAVE LED OUR COMPETITORS TO

LOWER THEIR FEES, WE HAVE MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRICING TO MERCHANTS TO REFLECT LOCAL COMPETITIVE TRENDS. FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCTIONS IN BANKCARD INTERCHANGE MANDATED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA REFORMS IN 2003 HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER MERCHANT

DISCOUNT RATES FOR VISA AND MASTERCARD ACCEPTANCE. AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, WE HAVE REDUCED OUR OWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES IN AUSTRALIA, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE BILLED BUSINESS AND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING

OUR CARDS. IN ADDITION, UNDER LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ARGENTINA, A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS REQUIRED TO CHARGE THE SAME MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE TO ALL MERCHANTS IN THE SAME INDUSTRY CATEGORY, AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR CREDIT CARDS CANNOT EXCEED 3%.

THE CENTRAL BANK OF VENEZUELA ALSO RECENTLY ISSUED REGULATIONS REGARDING THE MAXIMUM LEVEL OF MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES BY INDUSTRY CATEGORY.

IN EUROPE, INVESTIGATIONS OF INTERCHANGE ARE USUALLY HANDLED BY THE DOMESTIC COMPETITION LAW AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. IN ITS FINAL REPORT ON THE RETAIL BANKING SECTOR ISSUED IN JANUARY 2007, WHICH INCLUDED A REVIEW

OF THE PAYMENT CARDS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION APPEARED TO FAVOR COMPETITION LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOLS, RATHER THAN REGULATION OF PRICE LEVELS, TO ADDRESS PERCEIVED COMPETITION ISSUES. THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION IN ITS FINAL REPORT DO NOT HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW, BUT MAY BE USED AS THE BASIS FOR FUTURE REGULATION OR ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN THE EU MEMBER STATES.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RULED THAT MASTERCARDS MULTILATERAL INTERCHANGE FEES (MIF) FOR CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTIONS VIOLATE EC TREATY RULES ON RESTRICTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES.

MASTERCARD LODGED AN APPEAL AGAINST THE COMMISSIONS FINDINGS. THE RULING DOES NOT PREVENT MASTERCARD AND ITS MEMBER BANKS FROM ADOPTING AN ALTERNATIVE MIF ARRANGEMENT THAT CAN BE PROVEN TO COMPLY WITH EU COMPETITION RULES. THE

COMMISSIONS DECISION APPLIES TO CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER CREDIT, CHARGE AND DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE EU AND TO DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH MASTERCARD HAS CHOSEN TO APPLY THE CROSS-BORDER MIF. ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSIONS

INVESTIGATION INCLUDED COMMERCIAL CARDS, IT HAS RESERVED JUDGMENT FOR THE TIME BEING ON THE LEGALITY OF MASTERCARDS CROSS-BORDER MIF FOR COMMERCIAL CARD TRANSACTIONS.

IN 2002, THE COMMISSION GRANTED AN EXEMPTION TO VISA REGARDING ITS MIFS. THIS EXEMPTION EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND IN MARCH 2008 THE

COMMISSION OPENED FORMAL ANTITRUST PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VISA EUROPE LIMITED IN RELATION TO VISAS MIFS FOR CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS. THE COMMISSION HAS INDICATED THAT THE MASTERCARD DECISION SHOULD PROVIDE VISA WITH GUIDANCE

FOR THE WAY AHEAD, ALTHOUGH IT STATED THAT EVERY MIF MUST BE EXAMINED ON ITS OWN MERITS.

THESE DEVELOPMENTS MAY AFFECT

HOW THE COMPETITION AUTHORITIES IN THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EU VIEW DOMESTIC INTERCHANGE. IN 2007, FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPETITION REGULATOR IN POLAND FOUND INSUFFICIENT BASIS FOR VISA AND MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE FEES AND ORDERED THE ASSOCIATIONS AND

THEIR MEMBERS TO STOP THEIR CURRENT INTERCHANGE SETTING PRACTICES IMMEDIATELY. THE BANKS APPEALED THAT DECISION AND IN NOVEMBER 2008 THE DECISION WAS OVERTURNED. THE POLISH COMPETITION AUTHORITY HAS APPEALED THAT RULING.

REGULATORS, INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED THE INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF PROHIBITING MERCHANTS FROM PASSING THE COST OF

MERCHANT DISCOUNT FEES ALONG TO CONSUMERS THROUGH SURCHARGES ON

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CARD PURCHASES. ALTHOUGH SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM, HAVE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS PERMITTED MERCHANTS TO LEVY A SURCHARGE ON CREDIT CARD

PURCHASES, THERE HAS TO DATE BEEN A RELATIVELY LOW OVERALL INCIDENCE OF SURCHARGING, AS MERCHANTS DO NOT WANT TO RISK OFFENDING CUSTOMERS OR LOSING THEM TO COMPETITORS THAT DO NOT ASSESS SURCHARGES FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE

SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON OUR CARDS IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS.

THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ADOPTED A NEW LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS, REFERRED TO AS THE PAYMENT SERVICES

DIRECTIVE. THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE PRESCRIBES COMMON RULES FOR LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PAYMENT SERVICES

DIRECTIVE IS TO FACILITATE THE CREATION OF A SINGLE, INTERNAL PAYMENTS MARKET IN THE EU THROUGH HARMONIZATION OF EU MEMBER STATE LAWS GOVERNING PAYMENT SERVICES. ONE PROVISION OF THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE, SUBJECT

TO DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, BUT ALSO ALLOWS INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES TO OVERRIDE THIS RULE BY PROHIBITING SURCHARGING. TO DATE, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NETHERLANDS, SWEDEN, SPAIN, IRELAND AND GERMANY HAVE MADE KNOWN THEIR INTENT TO PERMIT SURCHARGING,

AND FRANCE HAS MADE KNOWN ITS INTENT TO PROHIBIT SURCHARGING. ALL EU MEMBER STATES ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE THEIR ELECTION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BY NOVEMBER 2009. THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE COMPLEMENTS ANOTHER EUROPEAN INITIATIVE, THE SINGLE EURO

PAYMENTS AREA (SEPA), WHICH IS AN INDUSTRY-LED INITIATIVE WITH SUPPORT FROM EU INSTITUTIONS. AMONG OTHER CHANGES, SEPA WILL INVOLVE THE ADOPTION OF NEW, PAN-EUROPEAN TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR CARDS AND CARD TRANSACTIONS. ALL OF THE

FOREGOING WILL ENTAIL COSTS TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN.

IN THE UNITED STATES, CONGRESS CONTINUES TO DEBATE THE INTERCHANGE ISSUE. THERE

HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HEARINGS ON VISA/MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, AND AT THE REQUEST OF CONGRESS, THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE COMPLETED A STUDY ON THE COST OF CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES AND IS UNDERTAKING A

STUDY ON THE STRUCTURE OF INTERCHANGE FEES AND THEIR IMPACT ON SMALL MERCHANTS. IN 2008, FEDERAL LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED THAT WOULD GIVE ALL U.S. MERCHANTS ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO NEGOTIATE COLLECTIVELY THE PRICE AND TERMS OF CARD ACCEPTANCE ON

NETWORKS WITH AT LEAST A 20% SHARE OF U.S. CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD PAYMENTS COMBINED, WITH A DEFAULT PROCESS FOR HAVING PRICES AND TERMS SET THROUGH GOVERNMENT ACTION RATHER THAN COMPETITIVE FORCES. ONE VERSION OF THIS LEGISLATION (THE CREDIT

CARD FAIR FEE ACT) WAS PASSED IN THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AS DRAFTED, THIS LEGISLATION WOULD NOT APPLY TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, BUT, IF ENACTED, WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON AMERICAN EXPRESS IN THE MARKETPLACE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT

CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS WILL CONTINUE AND SOME VERSION OF THE CREDIT CARD FAIR FEE ACT WILL BE INTRODUCED AGAIN IN 2009. THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS ON INTERCHANGE AND HAVE HELD SEVERAL

CONFERENCES FOCUSED ON INTERCHANGE RATES. WHILE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN MONITORING THIS ISSUE, IT HAS NOT INDICATED THE NEED TO REGULATE INTERCHANGE RATES IN THE UNITED STATES.

DURING 2008, THERE WERE ALSO A NUMBER OF BILLS PROPOSED IN INDIVIDUAL STATE LEGISLATURES SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE OR TO PROHIBIT

CARD COMPANIES FROM CHARGING MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE SALES TAX PORTION OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. OTHER PROPOSALS WERE AIMED AT INCREASING THE TRANSPARENCY OF CARD NETWORK RULES FOR MERCHANTS. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED TO

ESTABLISH MERCHANT LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH OF A MERCHANTS SYSTEM OR REQUIRE MERCHANTS TO ADOPT TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT SENSITIVE CARD HOLDER PAYMENT INFORMATION. PROPOSED STATE LEGISLATION AIMED AT REGULATING

PRICING OR OTHER ASPECTS OF MERCHANTS CARD ACCEPTANCE WILL CONTINUE DURING 2009. IN THE EVENT THAT GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE OR MERCHANT FEES CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OR STATE DATA SECURITY LEGISLATION IS ADOPTED,

OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AS REGULATORY INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD NETWORK

PRICING TO MERCHANTS AND RELATED ISSUES HAS INCREASED, THE COMPANY HAS RESPONDED TO MANY INQUIRIES FROM BANKING AND COMPETITION AUTHORITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RECEIPT OF A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND FROM THE ANTITRUST

DIVISION OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, PLEASE SEE OTHER MATTERS WITHIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

CHARGE CARDS

OUR CHARGE CARDS, WHICH CARRY NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES. CHARGES ARE APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF

FACTORS INCLUDING A CARDMEMBERS CURRENT SPENDING PATTERNS, PAYMENT HISTORY, CREDIT RECORD, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. CARDMEMBERS GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH, AND NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED ON THE BALANCE. CHARGE

CARD ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE CANCELLED. THE NO PRESET-SPENDING LIMIT AND PAY-IN-FULL NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS ATTRACT HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS

WHO WANT TO USE A CHARGE CARD TO FACILITATE LARGER PAYMENTS.

THE CHARGE CARDS ALSO

OFFER FLEXIBLE PAYMENT FEATURES TO CARDMEMBERS. THE SIGN & TRAVEL

®

PROGRAM GIVES QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDED PAYMENTS FOR AIRLINE, CRUISE AND CERTAIN TRAVEL

CHARGES THAT ARE PURCHASED WITH OUR CHARGE CARDS. THE EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION OFFERS QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDING PAYMENT FOR CERTAIN CHARGES ON THE CHARGE CARD IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED AMOUNT.

REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS

WE OFFER A VARIETY OF

REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS. THESE CARDS HAVE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT PAYMENT TERMS, GRACE PERIODS AND RATE AND FEE STRUCTURES. LENDING PRODUCTS SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, BLUE CASH FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND BLUE SKY FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, ENABLE

CARD MEMBERS TO PUT A LARGER PROPORTION OF SPENDING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS AND PROMOTE INCREASED RELEVANCE FOR OUR EXPANDING MERCHANT NETWORK.

CO-BRAND

CARDS

WE ISSUE CARDS UNDER CO-BRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPETITION AMONG CARD ISSUERS

AND NETWORKS FOR ATTRACTIVE CO-BRAND CARD PARTNERSHIPS IS QUITE INTENSE BECAUSE THESE PARTNERSHIPS CAN GENERATE HIGH-SPENDING LOYAL CARDHOLDERS. THE DURATION OF OUR CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM FIVE TO TEN YEARS. CARDMEMBERS EARN

REWARDS PROVIDED BY THE PARTNERS RESPECTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR SPENDING ON THE CO-BRAND CARDS, SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY POINTS AND CASH BACK. WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR CO-BRAND PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE

SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. WE EXPENSE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS

IN THE MONTH EARNED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. GENERALLY, ONCE WE MAKE PAYMENT TO THE CO-BRAND PARTNER, THE PARTNER IS SOLELY LIABLE FOR PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE CO-BRAND PARTNERS OWN

LOYALTY PROGRAM. AS THE ISSUER OF THE CO-BRAND CARD, WE RETAIN ALL THE CREDIT RISK WITH THE CARDMEMBER AND BEAR THE RECEIVABLES FUNDING AND OPERATING EXPENSES FOR SUCH CARDS. THE CO-BRAND PARTNER RETAINS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE MILES, POINTS OR

OTHER CURRENCY EARNED BY THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE PARTNERS LOYALTY PROGRAM.

IN DECEMBER 2008, WE ANNOUNCED A MULTIYEAR EXTENSION OF SEVERAL KEY AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA AIR LINES,

PROGRAMS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS ACROSS OUR CO-BRAND CREDIT CARD, MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, MERCHANT SERVICES AND TRAVEL BUSINESSES.

DURING THE

YEAR, WE LAUNCHED THE DELTA RESERVE CREDIT CARD, A SUPER PREMIUM DELTA CO-BRAND PRODUCT, FOR U.S. BASED CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. DELTA RESERVE OFFERS CARDMEMBERS THE ABILITY TO EARN MEDALLION QUALIFICATION MILES (MQMS) AT A FASTER

RATE, SHARE MQMS WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY, ACCESS THE CROWN ROOM CLUB, PRIORITY BOARDING AND SECURITY LINES, AS WELL AS CONCIERGE SERVICES AND AN ANNUAL COACH OR FIRST CLASS COMPANION CERTIFICATE.

FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNER, GENERALLY CO-BRANDED WITH THE PARTNERS NAME ON THE CARD. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED THROUGH

THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON SUCH CARDS. THE DURATION OF SUCH ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.

CARD

PRICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

CERTAIN OF OUR CARDS, PARTICULARLY CHARGE CARDS, CHARGE AN ANNUAL FEE THAT VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF

CARD AND THE NUMBER OF CARDS FOR EACH ACCOUNT. WE ALSO OFFER MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS WITH NO ANNUAL FEE BUT ON WHICH WE ASSESS FINANCE CHARGES FOR REVOLVING BALANCES. DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, WE ALSO CHARGE CARDMEMBERS AN ANNUAL PROGRAM FEE TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAMS AND FEES FOR ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE (E.G., LATE FEES) OR FOR CERTAIN SERVICES (E.G., ADDITIONAL COPIES OF ACCOUNT STATEMENTS). WE APPLY STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR CREDITWORTHINESS TO EACH CARDMEMBER

THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS BOTH AT THE TIME OF INITIAL SOLICITATION OR APPLICATION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING THE CARD RELATIONSHIP. WE USE SOPHISTICATED CREDIT MODELS AND TECHNIQUES IN OUR RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

®

PROGRAM

THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS OVER 1,600 REDEMPTION PARTNERS WORLDWIDE, IS OFFERED IN 98 MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND IS BUILT

AROUND 48 PROGRAMS, EACH TAILORED TO LOCAL MARKET NEEDS. THE PROGRAM ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO EARN ONE POINT FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY DOLLAR CHARGED ON ELIGIBLE, ENROLLED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND THEN REDEEM THEIR POINTS FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF REWARDS,

INCLUDING TRAVEL, RETAIL MERCHANDISE, DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND EVEN DONATIONS TO BENEFIT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHARITIES. POINTS GENERALLY HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF POINTS ONE CAN EARN. A

LARGE MAJORITY OF SPENDING BY ELIGIBLE CARDMEMBERS EARNS POINTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

THE U.S. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM HAS OVER 150

REDEMPTION PARTNERS AND FEATURES OVER 350 MERCHANDISE BRANDS. ENROLLEES MAY ALSO CUSTOMIZE THEIR OWN REDEMPTION EXPERIENCES THROUGH THE PROGRAMS CREATE YOUR REWARD AND EXPERIENCES OPTIONS.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM LEVELS ARE ALIGNED WITH SPECIFIC CARD PRODUCTS TO BETTER MEET CARDMEMBER LIFESTYLE AND REWARD PROGRAM USAGE NEEDS. AMERICAN

ALSO EXPANDED OUR LIST OF REDEMPTION PARTNERS AND ANNOUNCED A NUMBER OF INNOVATIONS TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND. WE EXPANDED THE 2008 MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM TO INCLUDE PARTNERS SUCH AS BROOKSTONE, COACH, LEGAL SEA FOODS, OLD NAVY, MANDARIN ORIENTAL

HOTEL GROUP, THE PENINSULA HOTELS, RUTHS CHRIS STEAK HOUSE, WEST ELM, AND JUMEIRAH HOTELS AND RESORTS. WE ALSO LAUNCHED NEW REDEMPTION OPTIONS LIKE THE EXPRESS REWARDS

SM

GAS CARD, A PREPAID CARD THAT CAN BE USED AT ANY GAS STATION THAT WELCOMES AMERICAN EXPRESS. AND TO DELIVER MORE VALUE TO OUR CARDMEMBERS SO THEY CAN BE REWARDED EVEN FASTER, WE RECENTLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF BONUS

POINTS CARDMEMBERS CAN EARN WHEN THEY SHOP THROUGH THE BONUS POINTS MALL

®

WEB SITE, A ONE-STOP SHOPPING PORTAL THAT FEATURES OVER 200 POPULAR BRANDS.

WHEN A CARDMEMBER ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM USES THE CARD, WE ESTABLISH RESERVES TO COVER THE COST OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REWARD

REDEMPTIONS FOR POINTS EARNED TO DATE. WHEN A MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ENROLLEE REDEEMS A REWARD USING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS, WE MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM PARTNER PROVIDING THE REWARD PURSUANT TO CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE IS DRIVEN BY CARDMEMBER CHARGE VOLUME, CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM, AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH REDEMPTION PARTNERS. AT YEAR END, WE ESTIMATED THAT CURRENT CARDMEMBERS WILL REDEEM

APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THEIR POINTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESRESERVES FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS COSTS APPEARING ON PAGE 17 OF OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH

INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND

LOYALTY. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THAT CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS PROGRAMS YIELD HIGHER SPEND, STRONGER CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND GREATER PROFIT FOR US. BY OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES, WE HAVE GIVEN OUR

CARDMEMBERS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THEIR REWARDS POINTS AND FAVORABLY AFFECTED OUR AVERAGE COST PER POINT. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO OPTIMIZE THE OVERALL ECONOMICS OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS. OUR PROGRAM

IS ALSO VALUABLE TO MERCHANTS THAT BECOME REDEMPTION PARTNERS AS WE BRING THEM HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS AND NEW MARKETING CHANNELS TO REACH THESE CARDMEMBERS.

CARD-ISSUING

BUSINESSCOMPETITION

OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND

INTERNATIONALLY. AS A CARD ISSUER, WE COMPETE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIBANK, BANK OF AMERICA, JPMORGAN CHASE, AND CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL) THAT ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS, AND DISCOVER

FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHICH ISSUES THE DISCOVER CARD ON THE DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES NETWORK. WE ALSO ENCOUNTER LIMITED COMPETITION FROM BUSINESSES THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND

AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ONLY AT LIMITED LOCATIONS. BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE

NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG ALL ISSUERS

REMAINS INTENSE.

COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT CARDHOLDERS, INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH

ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT, AIRLINE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS, CASH REBATES AND OTHER REWARD OR REBATE PROGRAMS, SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, TEASER PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CREDIT CARD

ACQUISITION AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND CO-BRANDED ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS. IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR, AS COMPETITORS HAVE TARGETED

OPENS CUSTOMER BASE AND OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES TO SMALL BUSINESSES.

MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ALSO ISSUE DEBIT CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL-PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS

BEARING EITHER THE VISA OR MASTERCARD LOGO. AS A RESULT, THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AND HAS GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS. DEBIT CARDS

ARE MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH AND CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS ARE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS. THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE DEBIT CARDS FOR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS IS LIMITED BECAUSE THERE IS NO CREDIT EXTENDED AND THE

CONSUMER MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN HIS OR HER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR THE PURCHASE AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ISSUE POINT-OF-SALE DEBIT CARDS FOR USE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS INCLUDE.



FEATURES AND THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING REWARDS PROGRAMS, PROVIDED TO CARDMEMBERS;



THE NUMBER, SPENDING CHARACTERISTICS AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF CARDMEMBERS;



THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS;



THE COST OF CARDS TO CARDMEMBERS;



PRICING, PAYMENT AND OTHER CARD ACCOUNT TERMS AND CONDITIONS;



THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF OTHER CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS AVAILABLE TO CARDMEMBERS;





REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION;



THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS TO MANAGE CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMIC CYCLE;



THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS TO IMPLEMENT OPERATIONAL AND COST EFFICIENCIES; AND



THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

AS

THE PAYMENT INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO FACE COMPETITION FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS, SUCH AS ONLINE NETWORKS AND TELECOM PROVIDERS, THAT LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CUSTOMERS EXISTING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD

ACCOUNT AND BANK RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT SOLUTIONS.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TRS, ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (CREDCO), PURCHASES THE MAJORITY OF CHARGE

CARD RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE USE OF CORPORATE CARDS ISSUED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CARDS ISSUED IN CERTAIN CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO TRADITIONALLY FINANCED THE PURCHASE OF RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY

THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE SALE OF MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. SIMILARLY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB HAVE FINANCED THEIR REVOLVING CREDIT RECEIVABLES AND CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES, IN PART, THROUGH THE

SALE OF SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT IN THE UNITED STATES. TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ALSO TYPICALLY HAVE FUNDED RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS. THE COST OF FUNDING CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS

IS A MAJOR EXPENSE OF CARD OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY MEETS ITS FUNDING NEEDS THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH

AS COMMERCIAL PAPER, SENIOR UNSECURED DEBENTURES AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITIES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. MARKETS, AND DEPOSITS PLACED WITH THE COMPANYS U.S. BANKS BY INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS.

AS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE FRAGILITY OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT HAVE IMPACTED FINANCIAL

SERVICES COMPANIES THROUGH MARKET VOLATILITY, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AND RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. SINCE SEPTEMBER 2008, THE MARKET FOR THE COMPANYS UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, LIKE THAT FOR VIRTUALLY ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY FROZEN, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN PROGRAMS SPONSORED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CERTAIN OF ITS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. THEREFORE, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN

THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON A RENEWAL OF INVESTOR DEMAND.

A SERIES OF

GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS LAUNCHED OR ANNOUNCED BY THE U.S. AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 PROVIDED SOME STABILITY TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND REDUCED DISLOCATIONS IN BENCHMARK INDICES SUCH AS LIBOR. THE COMPANY HAS PARTICIPATED IN

CERTAIN OF THESE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING FACILITY (CPFF) AND THE TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM (TLGP).

IN LATE 2008, WE ALSO MOVED TO INCREASE OUR FLEXIBILITY IN FUNDING U.S. CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE CARDS BY AMENDING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN CREDCO AND CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB TO ALLOW US TO SHIFT FROM TIME TO

TIME THE FUNDING OF THOSE RECEIVABLES FROM CREDCO TO CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB.

LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THEREOF COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR CARD AND LENDING BUSINESSES

OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND ROBUST. THE U.S. CONGRESS AND REGULATORS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS, HAVE CONTINUED THEIR FOCUS AND ATTENTION ON CERTAIN PRACTICES OF CREDIT CARD ISSUERS, SUCH AS INCREASES IN APRS,

CHANGES IN THE TERMS OF THE ACCOUNT, AND THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF FEES AND FINANCIAL CHARGES CHARGED BY CARD ISSUERS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LATE PAYMENTS, RETURNED CHECKS, PAYMENTS BY TELEPHONE, COPIES OF STATEMENTS AND THE LIKE. WE REGULARLY

REVIEW AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REFINE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND

EXPECTATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL (THE FFIEC), AN INTERAGENCY BODY

COMPOSED OF THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE TO THE INDUSTRY ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES (THE GUIDANCE). THE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE AREAS: (I) CREDIT LINE MANAGEMENT; (II) OVER-LIMIT PRACTICES; (III) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION PRACTICES;

(IV) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES; AND (V) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES. THE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT

COMPRISE THE FFIEC, ALTHOUGH IT IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE IDENTIFICATION BY BANK REGULATORS IN THEIR EXAMINATIONS OF OTHER CREDIT CARD LENDERS PRACTICES DEEMED BY THEM TO BE INAPPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, WITH REGARD TO

SUBPRIME LENDING PROGRAMS. AT PRESENT, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY LENDING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE SUBPRIME MARKET. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB EVALUATE AND DISCUSS THE GUIDANCE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS PART OF THEIR REGULATORY

EXAMINATION PROCESSES, AND, AS A RESULT, MAY REFINE THEIR PRACTICES FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON REGULATORY INPUT. THE GUIDANCE HAS NOT HAD, NOR DO WE EXPECT IT TO HAVE, ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES.

RECENT YEARS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASING PRESENCE OF NICHE PLAYERS THAT ARE SEEKING TO CAPITALIZE ON THE GROWTH IN THE LUXURY TRAVEL SEGMENT BY COMBINING LUXURY TRAVEL OFFERS WITH CONCIERGE-TYPE SERVICES.

INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES

WE ISSUE OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN NUMEROUS COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE. OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IS WIDESPREAD AND WE FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THOSE MARKETS THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER US THE GREATEST FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY. FOR

A DISCUSSION OF CARDS ISSUED INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH OUR GNS PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS, PLEASE SEE THE SECTION GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES ABOVE.

THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO BOLSTER ITS INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF NUMEROUS NEW OR ENHANCED CARD PRODUCTS DURING 2008. THESE ARE CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, EITHER ON OUR OWN OR, AS FURTHER

DESCRIBED BELOW, AS CO-BRANDS WITH PARTNERING INSTITUTIONS. THIS PAST YEAR, AMONG OTHER NEW PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE ANNOUNCED OR LAUNCHED CARDS WITH DAVID JONES (DEPARTMENT STORES) IN AUSTRALIA, CATHAY PACIFIC IN HONG KONG AND TAIWAN, AND CENTURION

CHARGE CARDS IN ARGENTINA AND CANADA.

WE OFFER MANY OF THE SAME PROGRAMS AND

SERVICES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS AS WE DO IN OUR U.S. PROPRIETARY ISSUING BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE OFFER VARIOUS FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS SIMILAR TO OUR SIGN & TRAVEL

®

PROGRAM AND OUR EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION TO CARDMEMBERS IN SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

ALSO, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ISSUE CARDS INTERNATIONALLY UNDER DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH BANKS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS IS AFFINITY CARDS WITH FRATERNAL, PROFESSIONAL, EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS.

FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PENETRATING THE AFFINITY CARD SEGMENT IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE WE ISSUE CARDS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGEST PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THAT COUNTRY. IN AUSTRALIA, AFFINITY CARDS ARE A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR

TOTAL REVOLVING PORTFOLIO AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR PROPRIETARY CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES.

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, REWARDS PROGRAMS ARE A

STRONG DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER BUSINESS. WE HAVE MORE THAN 1,500 REDEMPTION PARTNERS ACROSS OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WITH AN AVERAGE OF 95 PARTNERS IN EACH COUNTRY; LESS THAN 25% OF THESE PARTNERS ARE IN THE

TRAVEL INDUSTRY. CARDMEMBERS CAN REDEEM THEIR POINTS WITH MORE THAN 50 AIRLINES AND OVER 200 HOTELS. OUR REDEMPTION OPTIONS INCLUDE TRAVEL, RETAIL MERCHANDISE, ENTERTAINMENT, SHOPPING AND RECREATION GIFT CERTIFICATES, EXPERIENCES, FINANCIAL SERVICES

AND CHARITY REWARDS. IN 2008, WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR REWARDS PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL MARKETS, OFFERING MORE FLEXIBLE CHOICES THAT ENABLE CARDMEMBERS TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS MORE QUICKLY. AMONG OTHER NEW PARTICIPANTS, WE ADDED BRITISH

AIRWAYS MILES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IN A NUMBER OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY

CONSUMER CARDCOMPETITION

COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES, CONSUMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES USE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS FOR A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR TOTAL PAYMENTS, WITH SOME LARGE EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES JUST BEGINNING TO TRANSITION TO CARD USAGE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. ALTHOUGH OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IS WIDESPREAD, WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT

SHARE IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONALLY, OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM MULTINATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS CITIBANK, HSBC AND BANCO SANTANDER, AS WELL AS MANY LOCAL BANKS

AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. GLOBALLY, WE VIEW CITIBANK AND HSBC AS OUR STRONGEST COMPETITORS, AS THEY CURRENTLY OFFER CARD PRODUCTS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF MARKETS.

INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARDREGULATION

INITIATIVES BY REGULATORS TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS TO THE PAYMENTS

LANDSCAPE CONTINUED IN 2008 IN A NUMBER OF OUR KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND WE EXPECT SIMILAR ACTIVITY IN 2009. WHILE THE NATURE OF THE INITIATIVES VARIES WIDELY, REGULATORS ARE INCREASINGLY LOOKING AT DEVELOPMENTS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO HELP

INFORM AND GUIDE THEIR POLICY. IN A NUMBER OF MARKETS APRS AND OTHER CARD PRACTICES HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS OF ATTENTIONAND WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE IN 2009.

AS A CONSEQUENCE, INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY CONSIDER AND IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL CARD PRACTICE REGULATION IN 2009. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS PLANNING IN LIGHT OF CHANGING MARKET

CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE EVOLVING POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND MEDIA ENVIRONMENT.

GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CARD (GCC) OFFERS A RANGE OF EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO COMPANIES WORLDWIDE THROUGH OUR CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM, CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS, AND ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES SUCH

AS BUYER INITIATED PAYMENT.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CORPORATE CARD IS A CHARGE CARD THAT INDIVIDUALS MAY OBTAIN THROUGH A CORPORATE ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY THEIR EMPLOYER FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. THROUGH OUR CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM, COMPANIES CAN MANAGE THEIR TRAVEL,

ENTERTAINMENT AND PURCHASING EXPENSES AND IMPROVE NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE WITH SUPPLIERS, AMONG OTHER BENEFITS. WE USE OUR DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS TO OFFER CORPORATE CARD CLIENTS SUPERIOR DATA ABOUT COMPANY SPENDING, AS WELL AS STREAMLINED

DISPUTE RESOLUTION. WE ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CORPORATE CARDS IN OVER 50 COUNTRIES, WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE THROUGH PROPRIETARY OPERATIONS AND PARTNER BANKS, AND INTERNATIONAL DOLLAR CORPORATE CARDS IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES.

CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS (CPS) HELPS LARGE CORPORATIONS AND MID-SIZED COMPANIES MANAGE THEIR EVERYDAY SPENDING. CPS IS USED TO PAY FOR

EVERYDAY GOODS AND BUSINESS EXPENSES, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES, INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIES AND BUSINESS EQUIPMENT IN 22 MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. THESE TYPES OF PURCHASES BY CORPORATIONS HELP TO DIVERSIFY OUR SPEND MIX BEYOND TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT.

BUYER INITIATED PAYMENT ALLOWS AMERICAN EXPRESS TO PAY B2B SUPPLIERS ELECTRONICALLY ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENTS, PERMITTING THEM TO MANAGE

PAYMENTS, EXTEND THEIR OWN DAYS PAYABLE OUTSTANDING OR FLOAT AND INCREASE THEIR CASH ON HAND. BUYER INITIATED PAYMENT HAS FIRST BEEN OFFERED TO CLIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND WILL BE OFFERED IN OTHER MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD IN 2010. THIS SOLUTION

IS BEST SUITED FOR MID TO LARGE-SIZED COMPANIES THAT WANT TO STREAMLINE THEIR PAYMENT PROCESSES, REDUCE SUPPLIER INQUIRIES, CONVERT PAPER TO ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS, AND OPTIMIZE CASH FLOW.

WITH THE INCREASED FOCUS ON COST CONTAINMENT BY FIRMS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH THE CORPORATE MEETING CARD,

WHICH HELPS COMPANIES CONTROL MEETING EXPENSES. THE CORPORATE MEETING CARD IS AVAILABLE IN 24 MARKETS INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. IT PROVIDES CLIENTS WITH A TOOL TO CAPTURE SPEND AND PROVIDES CORPORATE MEETING PLANNERS WITH A TOOL TO SIMPLIFY THE

MEETINGS PAYMENT PROCESS AND ACCESS TO DATA TO SUPPORT NEGOTIATIONS WITH SUPPLIERS. GCC ALSO OFFERS THE CORPORATE DEFINED EXPENSE PROGRAM (CDEP). THIS PRODUCT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO SET A MAXIMUM AMOUNT TO BE CHARGED ON A CDEP CARD BEFORE

EXPIRATION AND PERMITS THEM TO SEPARATE SPENDING DATA FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES ON PROJECTS. IT IS DESIGNED FOR COMPANIES THAT WANT TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE RELOCATIONS OR TRAINING.

IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO LARGE AND GLOBAL CORPORATIONS, OUR GCC

BUSINESS MARKETS COMMERCIAL CARD PROGRAMS TO MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES (DEFINED IN THE UNITED STATES AS FIRMS WITH ANNUAL REVENUES OF $1 MILLION TO $1 BILLION) WORLDWIDE. GCC IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS WITH MID-SIZED COMPANIES,

WHICH REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. BUSINESSES OF THIS SIZE OFTEN DO NOT HAVE CORPORATE CARD PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, ONCE ENROLLED IN A CARD PROGRAM, MID-SIZED COMPANIES, WHICH USUALLY DO NOT HAVE WELL-DEFINED PURCHASING PROGRAMS, TYPICALLY

PUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR BUSINESS SPENDING (BOTH TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT AND NON-T&E, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES) ON THE CARD BECAUSE THEY CAN GAIN CONTROL, SAVINGS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. GCS OFFERS THE SAVINGS AT WORK

®

PROGRAM TO MID-SIZED COMPANIES IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS SIMILAR PROGRAMS GLOBALLY, WHICH PROVIDE COMPANIES WITH CASH BACK AND/OR DISCOUNTED PRICING ON EVERYDAY BUSINESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

SUCH AS CAR RENTALS, HOTELS, RESTAURANTS AND OVERNIGHT SHIPPING.

ON MARCH 28, 2008, WE PURCHASED CORPORATE PAYMENT SERVICES, THE

COMMERCIAL CARD AND CORPORATE PURCHASING BUSINESS UNIT OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (GE) FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION PLUS THE REPAYMENT OF CORPORATE PAYMENT SERVICES $1.2 BILLION IN OUTSTANDING DEBT OF THIS BUSINESS AS OF THE

ACQUISITION DATE. GE CONTINUES TO BE THE UNITS LARGEST SINGLE CLIENT AND HAS SIGNED A MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENT TO REMAIN A CLIENT OF OURS.

WE RECEIVED A WARRANT IN CONNECTION WITH OUR STOCK PURCHASE, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL 1.28 MILLION SHARES OF CONCUR COMMON STOCK AT ANY TIME DURING THE NEXT TWO YEARS, AT $39.27 PER SHARE.

GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESSCOMPETITION

THE COMMERCIAL PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH COMPETITION INCREASINGLY INTENSE AT BOTH THE CARD NETWORK AND CARD ISSUER LEVELS. OUR COMMERCIAL CARD OFFERINGS HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASING

COMPETITION, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION INTO NEW AND EMERGING MARKETS, EFFORTS TO TRANSITION BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SPEND FROM CASH AND CHECK TO ELECTRONIC INVOICING AND PAYMENT VEHICLES, AND EXPANDED MARKETING AND ADVERTISING

BUDGETS FOR COMMERCIAL CARD SERVICES. IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE INTEREST IN EXPENSE MANAGEMENT TOOLS IS PARTICULARLY STRONG, AS CLIENTS AIM TO CAPTURE DATA, ANALYZE TRENDS AND MAKE DECISIONS THAT ENHANCE THEIR CASH FLOW AND

PROFITABILITY.

IN ADDITION, BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE INCREASED EFFORTS TO SUPPORT CARD ISSUERS SUCH AS U.S. BANK, JPMORGAN CHASE, AND

COMMERCIAL CARD ISSUERS HAVE

INCREASINGLY ACQUIRED NICHE TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS TO ENHANCE DATA CAPTURE CAPABILITIES AND REPORTING FUNCTIONALITY. THESE EFFORTS ARE BUILT ON THE SOLID PROGRESS OF VISA AND MASTERCARD TO OFFER MORE GLOBAL, ROBUST SOLUTIONS. AS SUCH, GLOBAL

SERVICING, DATA QUALITY, TECHNOLOGICAL FUNCTIONALITY AND SIMPLICITY, AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE ARE AMONG THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOBAL TRAVEL SERVICESCOMPETITION

BUSINESS TRAVEL CONTINUES TO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FROM NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT

COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS. COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE, VALUE CREATION, CONVENIENCE, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER.

COMPETITION ALSO COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES, AS SOME COMPANIES HAVE BECOME ACCREDITED AS IN-HOUSE CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS.

FOR MANY YEARS, TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES HAVE FACED PRESSURE ON REVENUES FROM AIRLINES, AS MOST CARRIERS HAVE STOPPED PAYING BASE COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS THEY BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR WEB SITES AND OTHER MEANS. THESE TRENDS HAVE REDUCED THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL AGENTS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT RECEIVE DISTRIBUTION REVENUE FROM DIRECTLY BOOKED TRANSACTIONS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE

AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. THESE TYPES OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES.

OVERALL, INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, THE ONGOING TRENDS OF INCREASING DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES, THE RISE OF LOW-COST CARRIERS

AND ONGOING REDUCTIONS IN OR ELIMINATION OF AIRLINE COMMISSIONS AND FEES, CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON REVENUE FOR TRAVEL AGENTS.

OVER THE

LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE EVOLVED OUR BUSINESS MODEL ALLOWING US TO CHARGE CUSTOMERS FOR THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE AND THE VALUE WE CREATE, AND RESTRUCTURED OUR EXPENSE BASE THROUGH THE RATIONALIZATION OF OUR CALL CENTER LOCATIONS AND THE TRANSITIONING

OF MANY OF OUR SERVICES ONLINE. THIS RESTRUCTURING, AS WELL AS THE LEVERAGE OUR GLOBAL PRESENCE PROVIDES, HAS HELPED US TO BALANCE THESE REVENUE PRESSURES. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR NEW WAYS TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE DELIVER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS BOTH

ONLINE AND OFFLINE. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE FOCUSING ON DEVELOPING NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH ENHANCE THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS AND ADDRESS ONGOING TRAVEL INDUSTRY CHALLENGES AND

OPPORTUNITIES.

CARD. THE GIFT

CARDS WE OFFER ARE NOT FOR USE AT CRUISE LINES OR ATMS AND, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, A MONTHLY SERVICE FEE APPLIES IN THE THIRTEENTH MONTH AFTER PURCHASE OF THE GIFT CARD. SALES OF GIFT CARDS CONTINUED TO RISE IN 2008, REFLECTING THE GROWING

POPULARITY OF THESE PRODUCTS AND OUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE BUYING CONVENIENCE FOR CUSTOMERS.

THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS INCENTIVE SERVICES

L.L.C., A JOINT VENTURE WITH MARITZ INC., WE OFFER VARIOUS INCENTIVE PREPAID PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE CORPORATE GIFT CHEQUE, THE INCENTIVE FUNDS CARD AND SEVERAL POINTS-BASED INCENTIVE CARDS.

WE SELL AMERICAN EXPRESS PREPAID PRODUCTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS, INCLUDING SALES DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS VIA PHONE AND THE INTERNET. TRAVELERS

CHEQUES AND GIFT CHEQUES ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH A BROAD NETWORK OF SELLING OUTLETS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL OFFICES, INDEPENDENT TRAVEL AGENTS AND THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. GIFT CARDS ARE PRIMARILY SOLD THROUGH

TRAVEL OFFICES AND RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS, INCLUDING SUPERMARKETS AND DRUG STORES.

DURING 2008, WE SOLIDIFIED OUR POSITION AS THE LARGEST

GIFT CARD ISSUER IN THE UNITED STATES BY SIGNING DISTRIBUTION DEALS WITH TWO OF THE LARGEST MALL OPERATORS, INCLUDING THE MACERICH PARTNERSHIP, AND ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND THE SUPERMARKETS AND EVERYDAY SPEND RETAILERS THAT SELL OUR GIFT CARD

GLOBAL PREPAIDCOMPETITION

TRAVELERS CHEQUES COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CASH, FOREIGN CURRENCY, CHECKS, OTHER BRANDS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, DEBIT, PREPAID AND ATM CARDS AND, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, OTHER PAYMENT CARDS. OUR

PREPAID CARDS (OPEN-SYSTEM CARDS THAT CAN BE USED AT MULTIPLE UNAFFILIATED SELLERS OF GOODS OR SERVICES) COMPETE WITH THE SAME PAYMENT METHODS; GIFT CARDS COMPETE PRIMARILY WITH CASH, CHECKS AND OTHER OPEN-SYSTEM AND STORE-SPECIFIC GIFT

CARDS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE TRAVELERS CHECK AND PREPAID CARD INDUSTRY ARE.



THE NUMBER AND LOCATION OF MERCHANTS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE FORM OF PAYMENT;



THE AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER OF OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT;



THE AMOUNT OF FEES CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER;



THE COMPENSATION PAID TO, AND FREQUENCY OF SETTLEMENT BY, SELLING OUTLETS;



THE ACCESSIBILITY OF SALES AND REFUNDS FOR THE PRODUCTS;



THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; AND



THE ABILITY TO SERVICE THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTORILY, INCLUDING FOR LOST OR STOLEN INSTRUMENTS.

GLOBAL PREPAIDREGULATION

AS AN ISSUER OF

TRAVELERS CHECKS, WE ARE REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE MONEY TRANSMITTER OR SALE OF CHECK LAWS IN EFFECT IN MOST STATES. THESE LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHECK (AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, PREPAID CARD) ISSUERS TO OBTAIN

LICENSES, TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN HIGHLY-RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. WE INVEST THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW, PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY-RATED DEBT SECURITIES CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS. MANY STATES EXAMINE LICENSEES ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION, TRAVELERS CHECK ISSUERS

ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAWS OF MANY STATES TO COMPLY WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS UNDER WHICH SUCH ISSUERS MUST PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY TRAVELERS CHECK THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER 15 YEARS. NUMEROUS STATES HAVE

AMENDED THEIR ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS TO APPLY TO PREPAID CARDS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, SOME STATES HAVE ENACTED LAWS PERTAINING TO THE ISSUANCE AND THE SALE OF GIFT

CARDS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY RESTRICTING THE FEES THAT CONSUMERS CAN BE CHARGED OR THE EXPIRATION DATES THAT CAN APPLY TO GIFT CARDS. IN 2008, WE OBSERVED THAT A FEW STATES, MASSACHUSETTS AND RHODE ISLAND, REVISED THEIR

STATUTES TO PERMIT ISSUERS TO CHARGE FEES ON GIFT CARDS THAT CAN BE USED AT MULTIPLE UNAFFILIATED SELLERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT AS STATE LEGISLATORS CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

OPEN SYSTEM GIFT CARDS AND STORE-SPECIFIC OR CLOSED SYSTEM GIFT CARDS. IN CERTAIN STATES WHERE REGULATION CONTINUES TO RESTRICT FEES AND HAS MADE IT UNPROFITABLE FOR US TO OFFER GIFT CARDS, WE HAVE LIMITED OR WITHDRAWN FROM

SELLING THESE CARDS. FEDERAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELER CHECK ISSUERS AS MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES AND COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING

REQUIREMENTS BY ISSUERS AND SELLING OUTLETS. AT THIS TIME, STORED VALUE ISSUERS AND REDEEMERS, WHILE CONSIDERED TO BE MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES, ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER UNDER THESE REGULATIONS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE

VARYING LICENSING AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANKING CORP.

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANKING CORP. (AEBC) IS A NEW YORK INVESTMENT COMPANY ORGANIZED UNDER ARTICLE XII OF THE NEW YORK STATE

BANKING LAW AND IS A WHOLLY OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN EXPRESS. IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE SALE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. (AEBL) TO STANDARD CHARTERED, AEBL TRANSFERRED TO AEBC ITS BANKING BUSINESS IN GREECE AND CARD AND

RELATED BUSINESSES IN INDIA. FOLLOWING THE SALE, AEBC DIRECTLY OWNS AND OPERATES THESE BUSINESSES. AEBC NOW HAS BRANCH OFFICES IN GREECE AND INDIA AND IS SUBJECT TO CONTINUOUS SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT

(NYSBD) PURSUANT TO THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING LAW. AEBCS BRANCHES ARE LICENSED AND REGULATED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LOCAL REQUIREMENTS AS OTHER COMPETITORS THAT HAVE THE SAME

LICENSE.

SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE

WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, IN OUR CARD SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW FASTER INTRODUCTION AND GREATER CUSTOMIZATION OF PRODUCTS. WE ALSO ARE USING TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP

AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICE CAPABILITIES TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER A HIGH QUALITY CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAINTAIN A SERVICE DELIVERY PLATFORM THAT OUR EMPLOYEES USE IN THE CARD BUSINESS TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER SERVICING AND ACCOUNT

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE, UPDATING OF CARDMEMBER INFORMATION, THE ADDITION OF NEW CARDS TO AN ACCOUNT AND RESOLVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ISSUES. IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE ARE ENHANCING OUR GLOBAL PLATFORMS AND

CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS IN REVOLVING CREDIT.

WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE THE INTERNET TO LOWER COSTS, IMPROVE SERVICE QUALITY AND ENHANCE OUR

BUSINESS MODEL. DURING 2008, WE CONTINUED TO BROADEN OUR FOCUS TO USE THE INTERNET TO DRIVE REVENUE AND BUILD OUR BRAND, WHILE CONTINUING TO MIGRATE TRANSACTION VOLUMES AT LOWER COSTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE

INTERACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THAN WE DO BY TELEPHONE OR IN PERSON.

AS OF YEAR-END, CUSTOMERS HAD ENROLLED APPROXIMATELY

24 MILLION CARDS GLOBALLY IN OUR MANAGE YOUR CARD ACCOUNT SERVICE. THIS SERVICE ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO REVIEW AND PAY THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS BILLS ELECTRONICALLY, VIEW AND SERVICE THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ACCOUNTS AND

SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONGENERAL

OVERVIEW

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS BECAME BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND ELECTED TO BE TREATED

AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. UNDER THE SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION ESTABLISHED UNDER THE

BHC ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISES THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES, AS AN UMBRELLA REGULATOR OF THE CONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATION AND GENERALLY DEFERS TO THE PRIMARY U.S. REGULATORS OF THE COMPANYS U.S.

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, AS APPLICABLE, AND TO THE OTHER U.S. REGULATORS OF THE COMPANYS U.S. NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES THAT REGULATE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS INSURANCE COMPANIES REGULATED BY

STATE INSURANCE AUTHORITIES.

MOST ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS REGULATION BY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE

REGULATORY AGENCIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND BY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR REGULATORY BODIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES. CERTAIN OF OUR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO THE

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 (SARBANES-OXLEY) AND RELATED REGULATIONS AND RULES OF THE SEC AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN INTERPRETATION OR

ENFORCEMENT) COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TO THE EXTENT THAT DIFFERENT REGULATORY SYSTEMS IMPOSE OVERLAPPING OR INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR

BUSINESS, WE FACE COMPLEXITY AND ADDITIONAL COSTS IN OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

BANKING REGULATION

FEDERAL AND STATE BANKING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES EXTENSIVELY REGULATE THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, INCLUDING PRESCRIBING STANDARDS

RELATING TO CAPITAL, EARNINGS, DIVIDENDS, THE REPURCHASE OR REDEMPTION OF SHARES, LOANS OR EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO AFFILIATES AND INSIDERS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INTERNAL AUDIT SYSTEMS, LOAN DOCUMENTATION, CREDIT UNDERWRITING, ASSET

GROWTH AND IMPAIRED ASSETS. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR THE PROTECTION OF DEPOSITORS, OTHER CUSTOMERS AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION OF HOLDERS OF OUR SECURITIES. BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES

HAVE BROAD EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT POWER OVER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THE POWER TO IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL FINES, LIMIT DIVIDENDS AND RESTRICT OPERATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANKS ARE

PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ENGAGING IN UNSAFE AND UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICES.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES

UNDER THE BHC ACT, AN ELIGIBLE BANK HOLDING COMPANY MAY ELECT TO BE A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND THEREAFTER MAY ENGAGE

IN A RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE FINANCIAL IN NATURE AND THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY PERMISSIBLE FOR BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY MAY ENGAGE DIRECTLY OR THROUGH A SUBSIDIARY

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN CERTAIN STATUTORILY AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES. A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY ALSO MAY ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY RULE OR ORDER TO BE

FINANCIAL IN NATURE, INCIDENTAL TO SUCH FINANCIAL ACTIVITY, OR (WITH PRIOR FEDERAL RESERVE APPROVAL) COMPLEMENTARY TO A FINANCIAL ACTIVITY AND THAT DOES NOT POSE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF AN INSTITUTION OR TO THE FINANCIAL

SYSTEM GENERALLY. IN ADDITION TO THESE ACTIVITIES, A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY MAY ENGAGE IN THOSE ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY THAT HAS NOT ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY.

FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS, ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST BE WELL

CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED. A BANK HOLDING COMPANY MAY BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY BY FILING A DECLARATION WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT IT ELECTS TO BECOME A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. THE FEDERAL RESERVE GENERALLY MUST DENY EXPANDED

AUTHORITY TO ANY BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH A SUBSIDIARY INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION THAT RECEIVED LESS THAN A SATISFACTORY RATING ON ITS MOST RECENT COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT OF 1977 (THE CRA) REVIEW AS OF THE TIME IT SUBMITS ITS

DECLARATION. IF, AFTER BECOMING A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND UNDERTAKING ACTIVITIES NOT PERMISSIBLE FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE COMPANY FAILS TO CONTINUE TO MEET ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS, THE COMPANY MUST

ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS. IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT RETURN TO COMPLIANCE WITHIN 180 DAYS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY ORDER THE COMPANY TO DIVEST ITS SUBSIDIARY

BANKS OR THE COMPANY MAY DISCONTINUE OR DIVEST INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE ONLY FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY.

ACTIVITIES AND ACQUISITIONS

THE BHC

ACT REQUIRES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE: (1) IT MAY ACQUIRE DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, IF AFTER SUCH

ACQUISITION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WILL DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWN OR CONTROL MORE THAN 5% OF ANY CLASS OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF THE INSTITUTION; (2) IT OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OTHER THAN A BANK, MAY ACQUIRE ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE ASSETS OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION; OR (3) IT MAY MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH ANY OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

THE RIEGLE-NEAL INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1994, AS AMENDED (THE INTERSTATE BANKING ACT), GENERALLY PERMITS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO ACQUIRE BANKS IN ANY STATE, AND PREEMPTS ALL STATE LAWS RESTRICTING

THE OWNERSHIP BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY OF BANKS IN MORE THAN ONE STATE. THE INTERSTATE BANKING ACT ALSO PERMITS (1) A BANK TO MERGE WITH AN OUT-OF-STATE BANK AND CONVERT ANY OFFICES INTO BRANCHES OF THE RESULTING BANK IF BOTH STATES HAVE NOT

OPTED OUT OF INTERSTATE BRANCHING, (2) A BANK TO ACQUIRE BRANCHES FROM AN OUT-OF-STATE BANK IF THE LAW OF THE STATE WHERE THE BRANCHES ARE LOCATED PERMITS THE INTERSTATE BRANCH ACQUISITION AND (3) BANKS TO ESTABLISH AND OPERATE DE NOVO

INTERSTATE BRANCHES WHENEVER THE HOST STATE OPTS-IN TO DE NOVO BRANCHING. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANKS SEEKING TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS AUTHORIZED BY THE INTERSTATE BANKING ACT MUST BE ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND MANAGED.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST APPROVE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO AN EXISTING NON-U.S. INVESTMENT AND CERTAIN DIRECT AND INDIRECT ACQUISITIONS

BY THE COMPANY OF AN INTEREST IN A NON-U.S. COMPANY, INCLUDING IN A FOREIGN BANK, AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT BY CENTURION BANK OF FOREIGN BRANCHES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL ACT PROHIBITS A PERSON, ENTITY, OR GROUP OF PERSONS OR ENTITIES ACTING IN CONCERT, FROM ACQUIRING CONTROL OF A

BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUCH AS THE COMPANY UNLESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BEEN GIVEN PRIOR NOTICE AND HAS NOT OBJECTED TO THE TRANSACTION. UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS, THE ACQUISITION OF 10% OR MORE OF A CLASS OF VOTING STOCK OF THE COMPANY

WOULD, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN THE REGULATIONS, CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, ANY COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE BHC ACT

BEFORE ACQUIRING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OVER 25% OR MORE OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY OR THE POWER TO EXERCISE A CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER

THE COMPANY. IN THE CASE OF AN ACQUIRER THAT IS A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE BHC ACT REQUIRES APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY, IF THE ACQUISITION RESULTS IN

THE BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY CONTROLLING MORE THAN 5% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY.

SOURCE OF STRENGTH

UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY, THE COMPANY IS EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO CENTURION BANK

AND TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT IT. THE REQUIRED SUPPORT MAY BE NEEDED AT TIMES WHEN, ABSENT THAT FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY, WE MAY NOT FIND OURSELVES ABLE TO PROVIDE IT. CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS

SUBSIDIARY BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE EVENT OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK

REGULATOR TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK WILL BE ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE BHC ACT PROVIDES FOR FUNCTIONAL REGULATION OF BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACTIVITIES BY VARIOUS REGULATORS, THE BHC ACT PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL RESERVE FROM REQUIRING PAYMENT BY A HOLDING COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY TO A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IF THE FUNCTIONAL REGULATOR OF THE PAYOR OBJECTS TO SUCH PAYMENT. IN SUCH A CASE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND IMPOSE OPERATING RESTRICTIONS PENDING THE DIVESTITURE.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY

THE

COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS. THERE ARE TWO RISK-BASED MEASURES OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE

BEEN PROMULGATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, AS WELL AS A LEVERAGE MEASURE.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MORE SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENCES IN CREDIT AND MARKET RISK PROFILES AMONG BANKS AND FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, TO ACCOUNT FOR OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURE, AND TO MINIMIZE DISINCENTIVES FOR HOLDING LIQUID ASSETS. ASSETS AND

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS ARE ASSIGNED TO BROAD RISK CATEGORIES, EACH WITH APPROPRIATE WEIGHTS. THE RESULTING CAPITAL RATIOS REPRESENT CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS.

THE MINIMUM GUIDELINE FOR THE RATIO OF TOTAL CAPITAL (TOTAL CAPITAL) TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (INCLUDING CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS, SUCH

AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT) IS 8%. AT LEAST HALF OF THE TOTAL CAPITAL MUST BE COMPOSED OF COMMON EQUITY, UNDIVIDED PROFITS, MINORITY INTERESTS IN THE EQUITY ACCOUNTS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (INCLUDING, FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES BUT NOT

BANKS, TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES), NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK AND FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (BUT NOT BANKS) A LIMITED AMOUNT OF CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (TIER 1

CAPITAL). TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY CONSIST OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, QUALIFYING SUBORDINATED DEBT, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, OTHER PREFERRED STOCK AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND OTHER SO-CALLED RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO 25% OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. THE MINIMUM GUIDELINE FOR THE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK

WEIGHTED ASSETS IS 4%.

IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES.

THESE GUIDELINES PROVIDE FOR A MINIMUM RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS, LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (THE LEVERAGE RATIO), OF 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT MEET CERTAIN

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SPECIFIED CRITERIA, INCLUDING HAVING THE HIGHEST REGULATORY RATING. ALL OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO OF

AT LEAST 4%. THE GUIDELINES ALSO PROVIDE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES EXPERIENCING INTERNAL GROWTH OR MAKING ACQUISITIONS WILL BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN STRONG CAPITAL POSITIONS SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE MINIMUM SUPERVISORY LEVELS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT

RELIANCE ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FURTHERMORE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL CONSIDER A TANGIBLE TIER 1 CAPITAL LEVERAGE RATIO (DEDUCTING ALL INTANGIBLES) AND OTHER INDICATORS OF CAPITAL STRENGTH IN EVALUATING PROPOSALS FOR

EXPANSION OR NEW ACTIVITIES.

IN FEBRUARY 2009, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY OUTLINED THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PROPOSED FINANCIAL

STABILITY PLAN, WHICH IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING FINANCIAL CRISIS. ALTHOUGH THE DETAILS OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY PLAN ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED, A KEY ASPECT OF THE PLAN WILL BE AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS PUBLIC DISCLOSURES WITH RESPECT TO THE EXPOSURES ON THEIR BANK BALANCE SHEETS. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY WILL WORK WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FDIC, THE OTS AND THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY TO BRING A

MORE CONSISTENT, REALISTIC AND FORWARD LOOKING ASSESSMENT OF EXPOSURES ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE TREASURY INDICATED THAT ALL BANKING INSTITUTIONS WITH ASSETS IN EXCESS OF $100 BILLION (WHICH

INCLUDES THE COMPANY) WILL BE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY AND THE VARIOUS FINANCIAL REGULATORS AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO A STRESS TEST, WHICH WILL BE A FORWARD LOOKING COMPREHENSIVE

ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER WE HAVE THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO CONTINUE LENDING AND TO ABSORB THE POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT COULD RESULT FROM A MORE SEVERE DECLINE IN THE ECONOMY THAN PROJECTED.

FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CAPITAL RATIOS, PLEASE SEE NOTE 13 ON PAGES 95-96 OF OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT (FDIA) REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN

RESPECT OF FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS THAT DO NOT MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE FDIA SPECIFIES FIVE CAPITAL TIERS: WELL CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, UNDERCAPITALIZED, SIGNIFICANTLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CAPITAL TIER WILL DEPEND UPON HOW ITS CAPITAL LEVELS COMPARE TO VARIOUS RELEVANT CAPITAL MEASURES AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS, AS ESTABLISHED BY

REGULATION. A BANK MAY BE DEEMED TO BE IN A CAPITALIZATION CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY ITS ACTUAL CAPITAL POSITION IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY EXAMINATION RATING. ONCE AN INSTITUTION BECOMES UNDERCAPITALIZED, THE

FDIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY MORE RESTRICTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE CAPITAL CATEGORY IN WHICH AN INSTITUTION IS CLASSIFIED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION THAT IS NOT WELL CAPITALIZED IS ALSO

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON BROKERED DEPOSITS AND CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT REGISTRY SERVICE DEPOSITS.

THE FDIA GENERALLY

PROHIBITS AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FROM MAKING ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION (INCLUDING PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS) OR PAYING ANY MANAGEMENT FEE TO ITS HOLDING COMPANY IF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD THEREAFTER BE UNDERCAPITALIZED.

UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON BORROWING FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND TO GROWTH LIMITATIONS, AND ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN. FOR A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN TO BE ACCEPTABLE, ANY HOLDING

COMPANY MUST GUARANTEE THE CAPITAL PLAN UP TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF 5% OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AT THE TIME IT BECAME UNDERCAPITALIZED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL DEFICIENCY AT THE TIME IT FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE

PLAN. IN THE EVENT OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, SUCH GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY OVER CLAIMS OF ITS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS. IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FAILS TO SUBMIT AN ACCEPTABLE PLAN, IT IS TREATED AS IF IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED.

SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS,

INCLUDING ORDERS TO SELL SUFFICIENT VOTING STOCK TO BECOME ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE TOTAL ASSETS AND CESSATION OF RECEIPT OF DEPOSITS FROM CORRESPONDENT BANKS. CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR.

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANY AND TRS AS WELL AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN GENERAL, FEDERAL AND APPLICABLE STATE BANK LAWS PROHIBIT, WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL, INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM MAKING DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS IF SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT PAID OUT OF AVAILABLE RECENT EARNINGS OR WOULD CAUSE THE INSTITUTION TO FAIL TO MEET CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS. IN ADDITION

TO SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS ON THE DIVIDENDS THAT SUBSIDIARY BANKS CAN PAY TO THEIR HOLDING COMPANIES, FEDERAL REGULATORS COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE

BANKING ORGANIZATION.

IT IS FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY PAY TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS DIVIDENDS ON

COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF EARNINGS AND ONLY IF PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN DIVIDEND

LEVELS THAT UNDERMINE THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN CENTURION

BANK OR AEBFSB AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING LOANS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM CENTURION BANK AND

AEBFSB) BETWEEN CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THEIR AFFILIATES (INCLUDING THE COMPANY, TRS AND THEIR NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES), ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE SUBJECT TO QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE LIMITATIONS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS, AND

OTHER RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY STATUTE AND FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION. TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS. THESE RESTRICTIONS GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN A

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS

IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE FDIC ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS, AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 2005, BY WHICH THE FDIC ESTABLISHED A NEW

BASE RATE SCHEDULE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND SET NEW ASSESSMENT RATES THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2007. UNDER THESE REGULATIONS, EACH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS ASSIGNED TO A RISK CATEGORY BASED UPON CAPITAL AND

SUPERVISORY MEASURES. DEPENDING UPON THE RISK CATEGORY TO WHICH IT IS ASSIGNED, THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS THEN ASSESSED INSURANCE PREMIUMS BASED UPON ITS DEPOSITS. SOME DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE ENTITLED TO APPLY AGAINST THESE PREMIUMS A

CREDIT THAT IS DESIGNED TO GIVE EFFECT TO PREMIUM PAYMENTS, IF ANY, THAT THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY HAVE MADE IN CERTAIN PRIOR YEARS.

UNDER THE FDIA, THE FDIC MAY TERMINATE THE INSURANCE OF AN INSTITUTIONS DEPOSITS UPON A FINDING THAT THE INSTITUTION HAS ENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICES, IS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS OR HAS

VIOLATED ANY APPLICABLE LAW, REGULATION, RULE, ORDER OR CONDITION IMPOSED BY THE FDIC. WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY PRACTICE, CONDITION OR VIOLATION THAT MIGHT LEAD TO TERMINATION OF OUR DEPOSIT INSURANCE.

FDIC POWERS UPON INSOLVENCY OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

UNDER THE CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM, RECOVERY AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989 (FIRREA), INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MAY

BE LIABLE TO THE FDIC WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOSS INCURRED OR REASONABLY ANTICIPATED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFAULT OF, OR FDIC ASSISTANCE TO, ANY COMMONLY CONTROLLED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB

ARE COMMONLY CONTROLLED WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FIRREA CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION.

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER

OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. THE ABOVE

PROVISIONS WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, OBLIGATIONS UNDER SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB TO INVESTORS (REFERRED TO BELOW AS

PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS) IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF A RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE FDIC, AS SUBROGEE OF THE DEPOSITORS) HAVE PRIORITY OVER THE CLAIMS OF OTHER UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS AND

DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES, IN THE EVENT OF THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC WOULD EVER SEEK TO REPUDIATE ANY OBLIGATIONS HELD BY PUBLIC NOTEHOLDERS, SUCH PERSONS WOULD BE TREATED

DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE, IF ANYTHING, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS, THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

COMMUNITY

REINVESTMENT ACT

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA). UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE CRA, THE PRIMARY FEDERAL REGULATOR OF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS REQUIRED, IN CONNECTION WITH ITS EXAMINATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, TO ASSESS SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS RECORD IN MEETING THE CREDIT NEEDS OF THE

COMMUNITIES SERVED BY THAT DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, INCLUDING LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. FURTHERMORE, SUCH ASSESSMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED OF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION THAT HAS APPLIED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH OR

ACQUIRE THE ASSETS OR ASSUME THE LIABILITIES OF A FEDERALLY REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OR TO OPEN OR RELOCATE A BRANCH OFFICE. IN THE CASE OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY APPLYING FOR APPROVAL TO ACQUIRE A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE RECORD OF EACH SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICANT BANK HOLDING COMPANY IN CONSIDERING THE APPLICATION. IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY CRA RATINGS COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANYS AND TRS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES IN RELIANCE ON FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AUTHORITY.

PRIVACY AND FAIR CREDIT REPORTING

WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP AND MAKE

AVAILABLE RELEVANT, PERSONALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THEIR INFORMATION, AND WE GIVE THEM NOTICE REGARDING THE MEASURES WE TAKE TO SAFEGUARD THIS INFORMATION. REGULATORY ACTIVITY IN

THE AREAS OF PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE, SPURRED BY ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT THE RAPID AND WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION AND USE OF INFORMATION. AS NOTED ABOVE, AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO

ENHANCE PAYMENT ACCOUNT DATA SECURITY, IN 2006, WE AND SEVERAL OTHER PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FORMED PCI SSC, AN INDEPENDENT STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE THE EVOLUTION OF THE PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD.

THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2001. GLBA PROVIDES FOR DISCLOSURE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

PRIVACY POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS). THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT

PREEMPT STATE LAWS THAT AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS, AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE ADOPTED SUCH LEGISLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2003 CALIFORNIA ENACTED THAT STATES FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT. WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO

SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND OUR INTERNAL DATA PROTECTION POLICIES, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT, WHILE SEEKING TO COLLECT AND USE DATA PROPERLY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS

OBJECTIVES.

IN ADDITION, OVER 40 STATES, PUERTO RICO AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE ENACTED SECURITY BREACH LEGISLATION, REQUIRING

VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. IN ADDITION,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SEVERAL STATES ARE CONSIDERING LEGISLATION REQUIRING CERTAIN DATA SECURITY STANDARDS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN 1995,

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE),

WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION AND THE NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION (COLLECTIVELY, THE AGENCIES) PROMULGATED FINAL RULES PROHIBITING CERTAIN CREDIT CARD

PRACTICES FOR CONSUMER CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS. THE AGENCIES EXERCISED THEIR AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION 5(A) OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ACT (FTC ACT) TO AMEND REGULATION AA (I.E., UDAP), WHICH PROHIBITS UNFAIR OR

DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES. ADDITIONALLY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE PROMULGATED FINAL RULES SUBSTANTIALLY REVISING THE OPEN-END CREDIT PROVISIONS OF REGULATION Z. THE FINAL AMENDMENTS TO REGULATION AA AND REGULATION Z BECOME EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2010.

THE FINAL REGULATION AA AMENDMENTS, AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS, PROHIBIT ISSUERS FROM TREATING A PAYMENT AS LATE FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING

INCREASING THE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE OR IMPOSING A FEE, UNLESS A CONSUMER HAS BEEN PROVIDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO MAKE THE PAYMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE ISSUERS TO APPLY PAYMENT AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM

PAYMENT EITHER: (1) FIRST TO THE BALANCE WITH THE HIGHEST APR; OR (2) PRO RATA TO THE TYPES OF OUTSTANDING BALANCES BASED ON THE AMOUNTS OF THOSE OUTSTANDING BALANCES. IN ADDITION, THE AMENDMENTS PROHIBIT AN ISSUER FROM INCREASING THE APR,

UNLESS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING FIVE EXPRESS EXCEPTIONS APPLY RELATING TO : (1) ACCOUNT-OPENING DISCLOSURE; (2) VARIABLE RATES; (3) ADVANCE NOTICE; (4) DELINQUENCY; AND (5) WORKOUT ARRANGEMENTS.

THE FINAL REGULATION Z AMENDMENTS, AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS, EXTEND THE ADVANCE NOTICE PERIOD FOR CHANGES TO PRINCIPAL ACCOUNT TERMS FROM THE CURRENT 15

DAYS TO 45 DAYS AND REQUIRES THE CHANGES TO BE DISCLOSED IN A TABULAR DISCLOSURE SIMILAR TO THAT PROVIDED AT ACCOUNT OPENING. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO REQUIRE REVISIONS TO THE FORMAT AND CONTENT OF ALL MAIN TYPES OF OPEN-END CREDIT DISCLOSURES GOVERNED

BY REGULATION Z, INCLUDING APPLICATIONS AND SOLICITATIONS, ACCOUNT-OPENING DISCLOSURES, AND PERIODIC BILLING STATEMENTS.

THE FINAL

AMENDMENTS TO BOTH REGULATION AA AND REGULATION Z WERE ISSUED LARGELY AS PROPOSED. WHILE WE ANTICIPATE MAKING CHANGES TO OUR PRODUCTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. IF WE

ARE NOT ABLE TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES, THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FAIR CREDIT

REPORTING ACT OF 1970 (FCRA) REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER COMPANIES. FCRA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED BY THE

ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2003 OF THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT (THE FACT ACT). THE FACT ACT REQUIRES ANY COMPANY THAT RECEIVES INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN AFFILIATE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO PERMIT THE

CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM HAVING THAT INFORMATION USED TO MARKET THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ISSUED A FINAL RULE IMPLEMENTING THE AFFILIATE MARKETING PROVISIONS OF THE FACT ACT.

COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THESE AGENCIES WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES BY OCTOBER 1, 2008. WE QUALIFY FOR AN EXCEPTION FROM THE AFFILIATE MARKETING PROVISIONS OF THE FACT ACT, AND AS A RESULT, WE DO NOT NEED TO PROVIDE AN

AFFILIATE MARKETING OPT OUT. THE FACT ACT FURTHER AMENDS THE FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT OR DECREASE IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CONSUMER CREDIT INFORMATION. THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES AND THE FTC

PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE IN NOVEMBER 2007 REQUIRING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM CONTAINING REASONABLE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS THE RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IDENTIFY ACCOUNTS WHERE IDENTITY THEFT IS MORE LIKELY TO

OCCUR. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE BY NOVEMBER 1, 2008 BUT THE FTC HAS STATED IT WILL SUSPEND ENFORCEMENT OF ITS RULE UNTIL MAY 1, 2009. TRS CONTINUES TO BE REGULATED

BY THE FTC WITH RESPECT TO THIS NEW RULE AND IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING WHAT STEPS IT WILL NEED TO TAKE TO COMPLY. THE FACT ACT ALSO IMPOSES NEW

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DUTIES ON BOTH CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND ON BUSINESSES THAT FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FURNISHER

OF INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO PREVENT THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE RESULT OF IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO, IF A CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, THE

FURNISHER OF THAT INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A TIMELY FASHION. THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE PROPOSED RULES THAT SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE DISPUTES REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE FACT ACT ALSO REQUIRES GRANTORS OF CREDIT THAT USE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO OFFER

A BORROWER CREDIT ON TERMS THAT ARE MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE TERMS OFFERED TO MOST OF THE LENDERS OTHER CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE BORROWER THAT THE TERMS ARE BASED ON A CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. IN SUCH A CASE THE BORROWER IS

ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. GRANTORS OF CREDIT USING PRESCREENED CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN CREDIT SOLICITATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO INCLUDE AN ENHANCED NOTICE TO CONSUMERS THAT THEY

HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT FROM RECEIVING FURTHER PRESCREENED OFFERS OF CREDIT. THE ENACTMENT OF THE FACT ACT AND THE PROMULGATION OF RULES IMPLEMENTING IT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR PRACTICES.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE

IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE USA PATRIOT ACT WAS ENACTED IN OCTOBER 2001 IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS. THE PATRIOT ACT, IN ADDITION TO SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENING EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) AND TERRORIST FINANCING

LEGISLATION, AMENDED THE BANK SECRECY ACT, THE PRIMARY LEGISLATION GOVERNING AML REQUIREMENTS. THE PATRIOT ACT CONTAINS A WIDE VARIETY OF PROVISIONS AIMED AT FIGHTING TERRORISM AND MONEY LAUNDERING, INCLUDING PROVISIONS AIMED AT IMPEDING

TERRORISTS ABILITY TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH AML PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN

STANDARDS, INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS. WHILE AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS LONG MAINTAINED AML PROGRAMS IN OUR BUSINESSES, CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT

TO SPECIFIC AML REGULATIONS THAT PRESCRIBE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR COMPONENTS OF THE AML PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR GNS BUSINESS MAINTAINS A RISK-BASED PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE CARDS OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THEIR

NETWORKS MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AML CONTROLS. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER, OR DUE DILIGENCE, PROGRAM AND AN ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAM, INCLUDING A PROGRAM FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS (CUSTOMER

IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM) FOR APPLICABLE BUSINESSES. WE WILL TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS OR INITIATIVES THAT ARE ADOPTED, WHETHER IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE INDUSTRY HAS SEEN INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF THE AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WITH

EMPHASIS ON RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THE REQUIREMENT TO IDENTIFY AND REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, LEADING TO ENFORCEMENTS ACTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. TO MEET THIS INCREASED SCRUTINY, WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE

AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE RECENT ADOPTION BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF A NEWLY REVISED GLOBAL AML POLICY. THIS POLICY GOVERNS AML COMPLIANCE THROUGHOUT OUR ORGANIZATION, WITH EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES BEING PROVIDED WITH

RESOURCES, GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT WE MEET OUR LEGAL AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS. OUR AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF RISK-BASED POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT, DETECT AND

REPORT MONEY LAUNDERING.

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF REGULATED BUSINESSES. WE MONITOR

DEVELOPMENTS IN EU LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS IN THE OTHER MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES APPLICABLE TO PAYMENT INSTITUTIONS, CREDIT

PROVIDERS, INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS, TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN

COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SEE NOTE 24 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH YOU CAN

FIND ON PAGES 112-114 OF OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.) OUR REVENUES CAN BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR

THE PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN OTHER THAN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCY, AND FOR THE REMITTANCE OF THE

PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES). SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF THE CARD IN CONNECTION WITH SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT, BECAUSE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR MAY BE REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESS THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH

THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE PURCHASE BY CARDMEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A TRAVELERS CHEQUE DENOMINATED IN A SECOND CURRENCY; AND, IN MOST INSTANCES,

INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS, UNLESS PROPERLY MONITORED AND MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOW WE MANAGE RISK RELATING TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SEE RISK MANAGEMENTMARKET

RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS ON PAGES 44-45 OF OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

SALE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. / DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2007, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO

SELL OUR INTERNATIONAL BANKING SUBSIDIARY, AEBL, TO STANDARD CHARTERED PLC (STANDARD CHARTERED). ON FEBRUARY 29, 2008, STANDARD CHARTERED COMPLETED ITS PURCHASE OF AEBL. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY AND STANDARD

CHARTERED AGREED ON THE FINAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $796 MILLION, EQUALING THE FINAL NET ASSET VALUE OF THE AEBL BUSINESSES THAT WERE SOLD PLUS $300 MILLION. FOR 2008 THROUGH THE DATE OF DISPOSITION AND ALL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED, THE OPERATING

RESULTS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CASH FLOWS OF AEBL (EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE AEBL BUSINESSES THAT WERE NOT SOLD) HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CORPORATE & OTHER SEGMENT AND REPORTED SEPARATELY WITHIN THE DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS CAPTIONS IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES RELATED THERETO.

COMPANY ALSO ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH STANDARD CHARTERED TO SELL AMERICAN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL DEPOSIT COMPANY (AEIDC), A SUBSIDIARY THAT ISSUED INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES TO AEBLS CUSTOMERS, 18 MONTHS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE

AEBL SALE THROUGH A PUT/CALL AGREEMENT. A SUBSEQUENT PAYMENT FROM OR TO STANDARD CHARTERED WILL BE MADE BASED ON THE NET (DEFICIT) ASSET VALUE OF AEIDC ON THE DATE THE BUSINESS IS TRANSFERRED TO STANDARD CHARTERED. THE NET (DEFICIT) ASSET VALUE OF

AEIDC AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS $(44) MILLION AND $232 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008,

AEIDC QUALIFIED TO BE REPORTED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION, AS IT IS THE COMPANYS INTENTION TO EXERCISE ITS AEIDC PUT OPTION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009. ACCORDINGLY, FOR ALL THE PERIODS PRESENTED, AEIDCS OPERATING RESULTS, ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, AND CASH FLOWS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM OUR CORPORATE & OTHER SEGMENT AND REPORTED SEPARATELY WITHIN THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CAPTIONS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES RELATED THERETO.

(B)

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY REVISED ITS METHOD OF REPORTING THE CARDMEMBER LENDING NET WRITE-OFF RATE. HISTORICALLY, THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE HAS BEEN PRESENTED USING

NET WRITE-OFF AMOUNTS FOR PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND FEES. HOWEVER, INDUSTRY CONVENTION IS GENERALLY TO INCLUDE ONLY THE NET WRITE-OFFS RELATED TO PRINCIPAL IN WRITE-OFF RATE DISCLOSURES. THE WRITE-OFF RATE FOR 2008 AND 2007 IS A PRINCIPAL ONLY

WRITE-OFF RATE CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY CONVENTION. THE WRITE-OFF RATE FOR 2006-2004 REFLECTS PRINCIPAL ONLY WRITE-OFFS IN THE U.S. AND TOTAL WRITE-OFFS (PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND FEES) OUTSIDE THE U.S. AS PRINCIPAL ONLY WRITE-OFF INFORMATION WAS NOT

AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE U.S. FOR 2006 AND PRIOR PERIODS.

(C)

FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH (B) ABOVE, NET WRITE-OFFS WERE $2.6 BILLION, $1.6 BILLION, $1.2 BILLION, $985 MILLION AND $857 MILLION FOR

2008-2004, RESPECTIVELY.

RISK FACTORS

THIS SECTION

HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY

KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF

THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL RISKS

DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND ECONOMY GENERALLY, AS WELL AS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE

MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. THE STRESS EXPERIENCED BY GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS THAT BEGAN IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007 CONTINUED AND

SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED DURING 2008, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT THESE CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

RECENTLY, CONCERNS OVER THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT, THE U.S. MORTGAGE MARKET, A DECLINING REAL ESTATE MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES (IN PARTICULAR, IN THOSE MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE GENERATED SIGNIFICANT SPEND VOLUME ON OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS) AND

GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED VOLATILITY AND DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE MARKETS GOING FORWARD. THESE FACTORS, COMBINED WITH DECLINING BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT AND VOLATILE OIL

PRICES HAVE PRECIPITATED A GLOBAL RECESSION, WHICH MAY CAUSE FURTHER DECLINES IN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD USAGE AND HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN ADVERSE CHANGES IN PAYMENT PATTERNS, CAUSING INCREASES IN DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULT RATES. IF THE PERFORMANCE

OF OUR CHARGE CARD AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS CONTINUES TO WEAKEN THROUGH INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND WRITE-OFFS, OUR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR

COST OF CAPITAL COULD INCREASE.

THESE EVENTS AND THE CONTINUING MARKET UPHEAVALS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE

DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR. OUR REVENUE GROWTH IS LIKELY TO DECLINE IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, REVENUES MAY DECREASE, AND OUR PROFIT MARGINS COULD ERODE. IN ADDITION, IN THE EVENT OF EXTREME PROLONGED MARKET

ADVERSITY, SUCH AS THE GLOBAL CREDIT CRISIS AND ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING,

BUSINESS INVESTMENT, GOVERNMENT SPENDING, INTEREST RATES, THE VOLATILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INFLATION ALL AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, OUR PROFITABILITY. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CHARACTERIZED BY

HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER FAMILY INCOME, LOWER CORPORATE EARNINGS, LOWER BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE LACK OF AVAILABLE CREDIT, LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, REDUCED CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING, AND WORSENING CREDIT METRICS ALSO POSE

OTHER RISKS TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN PARTICULAR, WE MAY FACE THE FOLLOWING RISKS, AMONG OTHERS, IN CONNECTION WITH THESE EVENTS.



THE PROCESSES WE USE TO ESTIMATE LOSSES MAY NO LONGER BE RELIABLE BECAUSE THEY RELY ON COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THAT MAY NO

LONGER BE CAPABLE OF ACCURATE ESTIMATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS



OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THE MODELS AND APPROACHES WE USE TO SELECT, MANAGE, AND UNDERWRITE CREDIT TO OUR

CUSTOMERS BECOME LESS PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS.



IN THE EVENT THAT (I) THE THREE-MONTH AVERAGE RATE OF EXCESS SPREAD EARNED ON CREDIT CARD LOANS SECURITIZED BY US FALLS BELOW ZERO OR (II) OUR UNDIVIDED,

PRO RATA INTEREST IN THE SECURITIZATION TRUST ESTABLISHED BY US FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS REPRESENTS LESS THAN SEVEN PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING SECURITIES IN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT ACCOUNT MASTER TRUST (THE LENDING TRUST) (OR 15 PERCENT

OF THE TOTAL RECEIVABLES IN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ISSUANCE TRUST (THE CHARGE TRUST), THEN SUCH TRUST WOULD BE REQUIRED TO AMORTIZE EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED, WHICH WOULD ACCELERATE OUR NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

EFFECT ON THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ENTITIES TO MEET CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS.



IN THE EVENT THAT THE THREE-MONTH AVERAGE RATE OF EXCESS SPREAD EARNED ON CREDIT CARD LOANS SECURITIZED BY US FALLS BELOW 5 PERCENT FOR THE LENDING TRUST OR 4

PERCENT FOR THE CHARGE TRUST, THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS ESTABLISHED BY US FOR CREDIT CARD LOANS AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES, RESPECTIVELY, WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FUND A CASH RESERVE ACCOUNT OF UP TO APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION OR $207 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, DEPENDING ON HOW LOW THE APPLICABLE EXCESS SPREAD FALLS. BEGINNING WITH THE MONTHLY PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 24, 2009 AND THE RESPECTIVE DISTRIBUTION DATE OCCURRING ON FEBRUARY 17, 2009, THE THREE-MONTH AVERAGE EXCESS SPREAD

PERCENTAGE FELL BELOW FIVE PERCENT FOR THE GROUP 1 FIXED RATE SERIES IN THE LENDING TRUST. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED TO FUND THE CASH RESERVE ACCOUNTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE RESPECTIVE SECURED NOTES (I.E.,

MOST SUBORDINATED INTERESTS) FOR SUCH SERIES IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $22 MILLION. TO THE EXTENT CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO PERSIST OR WORSEN, WE WOULD EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FUND SUCH CASH RESERVE ACCOUNTS, AS WELL AS THE CASH RESERVE

ACCOUNTS OF OTHER SERIES OF CERTIFICATES ISSUED FROM THE LENDING TRUST.

POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN

REGIONS OR COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD

GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE

CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE,

INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS MAY DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT

SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS.

AS THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) PERSIST OR WORSEN, WE

COULD EXPERIENCE CONTINUING OR INCREASED ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND

CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL.

AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING EXTREME VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION SINCE AUGUST 2007, WHICH HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. IN RECENT MONTHS, THE VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION HAVE REACHED

UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS.

THE CONCERNS ON THE PART OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS HAVE FOCUSED ON A BROAD RANGE OF MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED AND

OTHER FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, INCLUDING THOSE RATED INVESTMENT GRADE, THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CREDIT AND INTERBANK MONEY MARKETS GENERALLY, AND A WIDE RANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS, ASSET

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLASSES AND SECTORS. AS A RESULT, THE MARKET FOR FIXED INCOME INSTRUMENTS HAS EXPERIENCED DECREASED LIQUIDITY, INCREASED PRICE VOLATILITY, CREDIT DOWNGRADE

EVENTS AND INCREASED PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. SECURITIES THAT ARE LESS LIQUID ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO VALUE AND MAY BE HARD TO DISPOSE OF. DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITY MARKETS HAVE ALSO BEEN EXPERIENCING HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND TURMOIL, WITH

ISSUERS SUCH AS US THAT HAVE EXPOSURE TO OR RELY ON THE CREDIT MARKETS PARTICULARLY AFFECTED.

WE NEED LIQUIDITY TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES,

INTEREST ON DEBT AND DIVIDENDS ON CAPITAL STOCK AND TO REPAY MATURING LIABILITIES. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WE COULD BE FORCED TO LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY ARE

PAYMENTS FROM CARDMEMBERS, CASH FLOW FROM OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ASSETS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF CASH OR ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH, DEPOSITS AND ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY IN NORMAL MARKETS ALSO

INCLUDE A VARIETY OF SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT AND THE SECURITIZATION OF OUR CREDIT CARD LOAN AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION, WE ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM THE PRESSURES BROUGHT ON BY THE CURRENT CRISIS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE

FRAGILITY OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT HAVE IMPACTED FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES THROUGH MARKET VOLATILITY, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AND RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. SINCE SEPTEMBER 2008, THE MARKET FOR OUR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, LIKE THAT FOR VIRTUALLY ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY FROZEN, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN PROGRAMS SPONSORED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CERTAIN OF ITS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

DISCUSSED BELOW. THEREFORE, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON A RENEWAL OF INVESTOR DEMAND.

IN THE EVENT CURRENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING INTERNAL SOURCES, DO NOT SATISFY OUR NEEDS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING. THE

AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET CONDITIONS, THE GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, OUR CREDIT RATINGS (WHICH WERE DOWNGRADED

IN 2008, WITH RESPECT TO OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, BY TWO OF THE MAJOR RATINGS AGENCIES), AND CREDIT CAPACITY, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LENDERS COULD DEVELOP A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF OUR LONG- OR SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL PROSPECTS IF WE INCUR LARGE

CREDIT LOSSES OR IF THE LEVEL OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY DECREASES DUE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

SIMILARLY, OUR ACCESS TO FUNDS MAY BE

IMPAIRED IF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR RATING AGENCIES TAKE NEGATIVE ACTIONS AGAINST US. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SOURCES OF CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING THE CPFF AND THE TLGP, WHICH ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW

YORK, THE FDIC AND OTHER FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, ARE SUBJECT TO OUR ABILITY TO MEET OR CONTINUE TO MEET THE CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATION IN SUCH FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS AND ARE TEMPORARY IN NATURE AS SUCH PROGRAMS ARE SCHEDULED TO TERMINATE

ON VARIOUS DATES DURING 2009.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO TAKEN CERTAIN OTHER ACTIONS IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE TO SUPPORT THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING INVESTING IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF STABILIZING AND PROVIDING LIQUIDITY TO THE U.S. FINANCIAL MARKETS PURSUANT TO THE CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THE IMPACT OF

WHICH WE CANNOT ASSESS AT THIS TIME. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TERM ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES LOAN FACILITY (THE TALF) IN AN EFFORT TO FACILITATE THE ISSUANCE OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND IMPROVE

THE MARKET CONDITIONS FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES GENERALLY. IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME WHAT IMPACT THE TALF PROGRAM WILL HAVE ON RETURNING THE SECURITIZATION MARKET TO HISTORICAL CAPACITY AND PRICING LEVELS.

DISRUPTIONS, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. SUCH

MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE, IN A TIMELY MANNER, MATURING LIABILITIES, SATISFY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY RAISING CAPITAL, ISSUE

SHORTER-TENURED SECURITIES THAN DESIRED, OR BEAR AN

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNATTRACTIVE COST OF CAPITAL, WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. IN ADDITION, DURING 2008, OUR CREDIT SPREADS

WIDENED CONSIDERABLY. OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION WILL ALSO BE IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES WITH RESPECT TO THE GROWTH OF OUR BROKERED RETAIL CD PROGRAM AND BROKERAGE SWEEP ACCOUNT PROGRAM AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR DIRECT DEPOSIT

INITIATIVE.

IF CURRENT LEVELS OF MARKET DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY CONTINUE OR WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT

EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE EFFECT, WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL, ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF OUR RETAINED INTERESTS IN OUR SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS

COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING

NEEDS, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 35-41 OF OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

WE CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ROUTINE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL

BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. DEFAULTS OR NON-PERFORMANCE BY, OR EVEN RUMORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT, ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS, OR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, HAVE LED TO MARKET-WIDE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS

AND COULD LEAD TO LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY ONE OR MORE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ANY REDUCTION IN THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING FROM, AND RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO,

THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ALTHOUGH THE

COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM DEBT IS CURRENTLY RATED INVESTMENT GRADE (AT A LEVELS) BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES, THE RATINGS OF THAT DEBT HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 BY MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICES (MOODYS) AND STANDARD & POORS (S&P), TWO OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. THE RATING AGENCIES REGULARLY EVALUATE THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR RATINGS OF THE

COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS FACTORS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THEIR CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY GENERALLY. IN LIGHT OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT RESPECTIVE RATINGS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THOSE

RATINGS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER TERMS UPON WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN FUNDING.

IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH EACH OF MOODYS AND S&P HAS AFFIRMED THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2008, A DOWNGRADE OF THE SHORT-TERM RATINGS OF THE COMPANYS TRS SUBSIDIARY BELOW ITS CURRENT P-1 RATING BY MOODYS AND A-1 RATING BY S&P WOULD REQUIRE TRS, AS SERVICER TO OUR SECURITIZATION TRUSTS, TO TRANSFER COLLECTIONS ON THE

SECURITIZED ASSETS TO INVESTORS ON A DAILY, RATHER THAN A MONTHLY, BASIS OR MAKE ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE RATING AGENCIES TO ALLOW TRS TO CONTINUE TO TRANSFER COLLECTIONS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. SUCH ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OBTAINING

APPROPRIATE GUARANTEES FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF PAYMENT AND DEPOSIT OBLIGATIONS OF TRS, AS SERVICER. THE DOWNGRADE OF TRSS SHORT-TERM RATINGS AND THE CONSEQUENT INCREASED OPERATIONAL COSTS OF DAILY COLLECTIONS OR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

MAKING OF ANY ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET FOR OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

IN ADDITION, A DOWNGRADE OF THE SHORT-TERM RATINGS OF OUR CREDCO SUBSIDIARY BELOW ITS CURRENT P-1/A-1/F1 RATINGS BY TWO OR MORE RATING AGENCIES WOULD RESTRICT SUCH COMPANYS ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CPFF

66

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND CHARGE CARD

RECEIVABLES AND CREDIT CARD LOANS.

WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ACTIONS RATING AGENCIES MAY TAKE. AS WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BY ANY OF THE RATING AGENCIES.

ADVERSE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD DECREASE REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

DURING 2008, OVER 32% OF OUR REVENUE NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WAS GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE

GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

LEGAL

AND REGULATORY RISKS

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NEW REGULATIONS TO

WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS

EACH BECAME BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT

LIMITATION, CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL REGULATION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TWO U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR NON-BANKING ACTIVITIES UNDER THE

FEDERAL RESERVES REGULATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHANGE IN REGULATORY STATUS, PLEASE SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONGENERAL BEGINNING ON PAGE 34 ABOVE.

IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR

CAPITAL STOCK.

IN JANUARY 2009, WE ISSUED PREFERRED STOCK AND A WARRANT TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON SHARES TO THE TREASURY AS PART OF

THE CPP PRIOR TO JANUARY 9, 2012, UNLESS WE HAVE REDEEMED THE PREFERRED STOCK OR THE TREASURY HAS TRANSFERRED THE PREFERRED STOCK TO A THIRD PARTY, THE CONSENT OF THE TREASURY WILL BE REQUIRED FOR US TO (1) DECLARE OR PAY ANY DIVIDEND OR

MAKE ANY DISTRIBUTION ON OUR COMMON SHARES (OTHER THAN REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS OF NOT MORE THAN $0.18 PER SHARE) OR (2) REDEEM, PURCHASE OR ACQUIRE ANY OF OUR COMMON SHARES OR OTHER EQUITY OR CAPITAL SECURITIES, OTHER THAN IN

CONNECTION WITH BENEFIT PLANS CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE AND CERTAIN OTHER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO DECLARE OR PAY DIVIDENDS OR REPURCHASE OUR COMMON SHARES OR OTHER EQUITY OR CAPITAL SECURITIES WILL BE SUBJECT TO

RESTRICTIONS IN THE EVENT THAT WE FAIL TO DECLARE AND PAY (OR SET ASIDE FOR PAYMENT) FULL DIVIDENDS ON THE PREFERRED STOCK.

CONGRESS HAS

HELD HEARINGS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CPP AND THE USE OF FUNDS PROVIDED BY THIS PROGRAM AND HAS ADOPTED, AND MAY ADOPT IN THE FUTURE, LEGISLATION IMPACTING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OBTAIN FUNDING UNDER THE CPP. THIS COULD ALSO INCLUDE CHANGING

LENDING PRACTICES THAT LEGISLATORS BELIEVE LED TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION. ALTHOUGH IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION WILL BE ENACTED INTO LAW, FURTHER

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESTRICTIONS MAY BE IMPOSED ADMINISTRATIVELY BY THE TREASURY. SUCH PROVISIONS COULD FURTHER RESTRICT OUR LENDING OR INCREASE GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT OF OUR

BUSINESSES AND OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES.

WE ARE ALSO LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS BY OUR REGULATORS WHO COULD

PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF EARNINGS, AND ONLY IF

PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON BANK HOLDING COMPANY DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS, PLEASE SEE FINANCIAL REVIEWSHARE

REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS ON PAGE 34 AND NOTE 13 ON PAGE 96 OF OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

CERTAIN RULES ADOPTED BY FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON DECEMBER 18, 2008, FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES PUBLISHED FINAL AMENDMENTS TO REGULATION AA (I.E., UDAP), WHICH RELATE TO UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES, AND REGULATION Z,

WHICH RELATE TO TRUTH IN LENDING, THAT RESTRICT CERTAIN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD PRACTICES AND REQUIRE EXPANDED DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS. THESE AMENDMENTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.



PROHIBIT INTEREST RATE INCREASES ON OUTSTANDING CREDIT CARD BALANCES EXCEPT UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES;



PROHIBIT INTEREST RATE INCREASES ON NEW TRANSACTIONS DURING THE FIRST YEAR AFTER THE ACCOUNT IS OPENED, EXCEPT UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES;



IN THE CASE OF ACCOUNTS WITH DIFFERENT ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES (APR) ON DIFFERENT BALANCES, PROHIBIT THE APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS TO THE LOWEST-RATE

BALANCES FIRST;



PROHIBIT THE IMPOSITION OF A HIGHER OR DEFAULT APR ON EXISTING BALANCES UNLESS AN ACCOUNT IS 30 DAYS PAST DUE; AND



REQUIRE THAT CONSUMERS BE PROVIDED WITH A CERTAIN, REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO MAKE CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS.

THESE AMENDMENTS BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2010. WE ARE STILL EVALUATING THE FINAL AMENDMENTS AND THEIR RESULTING IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. WHILE WE

ANTICIPATE MAKING CHANGES TO OUR PRODUCTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES, THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, REGULATORS AND CONGRESS ARE CONTINUING THEIR SCRUTINY OF OUR INDUSTRYS PRICING, FINANCE

CHARGES AND PRACTICES RELATING TO ITS CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING INCREASES IN APRS AND FEES. ANY LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRICE OUR SERVICES AND MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES FREELY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

TRANSACTION VOLUME AND REVENUES.

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL

REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND REVENUES THROUGH OUR NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING AND CARD ACTIVITIES.

IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS A PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY

HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN

THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. IN ADDITION, THE

EUROPEAN UNION HAS ADOPTED A NEW LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVE, CALLED THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE, FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS, THAT PUTS IN PLACE A COMMON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS,

INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.

THE U.S. CONGRESS IS ALSO PRESENTLY CONSIDERING, OR MAY

CONSIDER, LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES IN THE AREA OF INTERNET TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS INTERNET PRESCRIPTION DRUG PURCHASES AND COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT, AMONG OTHERS, THAT COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY.

FEDERAL AND STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO CONTACTED PAYMENT COMPANIES CONCERNING THESE ISSUES. IF IMPLEMENTED, THESE INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO MONITOR, FILTER, RESTRICT, OR OTHERWISE OVERSEE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, THEREBY INCREASING OUR COSTS OR DECREASING OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES AND LEGISLATURES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES,

SECURITY, AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED VALUE

CARDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, POLAND, GERMANY, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), AUSTRALIA,

MEXICO, AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING OR ON APPEAL. THE COLLECTIVELY-SET INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN FOUR PARTY

PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR BANKCARD DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT

HAVE COLLECTIVELY-SET INTERCHANGE FEES.

ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS AND ON THEIR OPERATIONS ON A MULTILATERAL BASIS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION

OF THE BANKCARD ASSOCIATIONS PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS

WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, CONGRESS CONTINUES TO DEBATE THE

INTERCHANGE ISSUE. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HEARINGS ON VISA/MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, AND AT THE REQUEST OF CONGRESS, THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE COMPLETED A STUDY ON THE COST OF CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE TO FEDERAL

AGENCIES AND IS UNDERTAKING A STUDY ON THE STRUCTURE OF INTERCHANGE FEES AND THEIR IMPACT ON SMALL MERCHANTS. IN 2008, FEDERAL LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED THAT WOULD GIVE ALL U.S. MERCHANTS ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO NEGOTIATE COLLECTIVELY THE PRICE AND

TERMS OF CARD ACCEPTANCE ON NETWORKS WITH AT LEAST A 20% SHARE OF U.S. CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD PAYMENTS COMBINED, WITH A DEFAULT PROCESS FOR HAVING PRICES AND TERMS SET THROUGH GOVERNMENT ACTION RATHER THAN COMPETITIVE FORCES. ONE VERSION OF THIS

LEGISLATION, THE CREDIT CARD FAIR FEE ACT (CCFFA), WAS PASSED IN THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AS DRAFTED, THIS LEGISLATION WOULD NOT APPLY TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, BUT, IF ENACTED, WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON AMERICAN EXPRESS IN

THE MARKETPLACE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS WILL CONTINUE AND SOME VERSION OF THE CCFFA WILL BE INTRODUCED AGAIN IN 2009. THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS ON INTERCHANGE AND HAVE

HELD SEVERAL CONFERENCES FOCUSED ON INTERCHANGE RATES. WHILE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN MONITORING THIS ISSUE, IT HAS NOT INDICATED THE NEED TO REGULATE INTERCHANGE RATES IN THE UNITED STATES.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON OUR COMPANY, SUCH AS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR RESULT IN A

REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR NETWORKS OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUES FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT

THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BUSINESS PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN

TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR

RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR CARDS, NETWORKS AND OTHER SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE, OR ACCESS COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY BE LIMITED BY PATENT RIGHTS THAT THIRD

PARTIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE DEVELOP MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS OR BY RESISTANCE FROM CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS TO SUCH

CHANGES.

WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS,

TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION. THESE MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND A RESULTING LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION,

COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS, PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND

THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED LITIGATION, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT A FUTURE ASSERTION OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST US WILL NOT CAUSE US TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE, ROYALTY OR

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES.

TRANSACTIONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESERVE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, LIQUIDITY, COST OF FUNDS AND OPERATIONS.

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD HAS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ACCOUNTING FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES, WHICH COULD, IF ULTIMATELY ADOPTED, RESULT IN THE

COMPANY HAVING TO CONSOLIDATE APPROXIMATELY $29 BILLION (AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008) OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE LENDING TRUST. THIS CONSOLIDATION WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REESTABLISH LOSS RESERVES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION (AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008), WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE COMPANYS REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS AT THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL. THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE LENDING TRUST WOULD PRIMARILY IMPACT THE COMPANYS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB BANKING

SUBSIDIARIES. ANY CONSOLIDATION OF THE LENDING TRUST COULD INCREASE THE COMPANYS, CENTURION BANKS AND AEBFSBS RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ON THEIR RESPECTIVE BALANCE SHEETS AND THUS INCREASE THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO MAINTAIN OUR REGULATORY

CAPITAL LEVELS.

IF OUR BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WERE TO FAIL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE WOULD BECOME SUBJECT TO

RESTRICTIONS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT NORMAL OPERATIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY AND OUR COST OF FUNDS, SUCH AS LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE BROKERED DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES TO THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR

SECURITIZATIONS MAY RESULT IN AN INABILITY TO ACHIEVE BANKRUPTCY REMOTE STATUS FOR THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS AND PREVENT ISSUANCE FROM THE TRUSTS OF HIGHLY RATED INVESTOR INTERESTS.

WE CANNOT AT THIS TIME PREDICT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY FINAL AMENDMENTS TO BE PROMULGATED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD OR THE

IMPACT OF ANY SUCH AMENDMENTS, INCLUDING WHETHER, WHEN AND IN WHAT FORM ANY TRANSFERS THAT CURRENTLY QUALIFY AS SALES WILL BE RECOGNIZED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET; WHAT EFFECT THE RECOGNITION OF TRANSFERS WOULD HAVE ON CAPITAL, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE

ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF RECEIVABLES IN THE TRUST, OR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS; THE IMPACT OF THE AMENDMENTS ON THE MARKET FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES; WHETHER THE AMENDMENTS WILL CAUSE US TO EXECUTE FEWER SECURITIZATIONS; WHETHER

THE AMENDMENTS WILL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRIGGER THE BREACH OF ANY FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN OUR CREDIT FACILITY; OR WHAT EFFECT THE AMENDMENTS WILL HAVE ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR THE CREDIT RATINGS OF

DEBT ISSUED BY THE TRUST.

REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ISSUED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS RELATED TO

PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THESE REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE DATA SECURITY RULE UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. THE DATA SECURITY RULE REQUIRES THAT EACH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN, COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF ANY CUSTOMER INFORMATION AT ISSUE. THE HEIGHTENED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FOCUS ON DATA SECURITY, INCLUDING REQUIRING CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A DATA BREACH, CONTINUES. THE NEW

111

TH

CONGRESS WILL LIKELY CONSIDER DATA SECURITY/DATA BREACH LEGISLATION IN 2009 THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD AFFECT US.

IN ADDITION, OVER 40 STATES, PUERTO RICO AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE ENACTED SECURITY BREACH LEGISLATION, REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER

NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL STATES ARE CONSIDERING LEGISLATION REQUIRING CERTAIN DATA SECURITY STANDARDS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN 1995, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND

COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER

OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS REGULATING DATA PROTECTION IN EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER

STATES.

REGULATION OF PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY MAY MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR COSTS AND MAY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF OUR CARDS THAT WE ISSUE,

OR RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY EXPLOIT OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT COULD RESULT IN

FINES, SANCTIONS AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN

PART, ON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A CRITICAL PERIOD OF

COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE MARKET FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR CANDIDATES TO REPLACE OR SUCCEED MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR

MANAGEMENT TEAM OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. IN ADDITION, AS A CURRENT PARTICIPANT IN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURYS CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE RECENTLY ENACTED AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT

ACT OF 2009, WHICH CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS ON THE AMOUNT AND FORM OF BONUS, RETENTION AND OTHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION THAT WE MAY PAY TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THESE PROVISIONS COULD FURTHER AFFECT

OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES AND/OR REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES.

BUSINESSES IN THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND PATENT CLAIMS. MANY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL

COMPENSATORY OR

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE

WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES.

BUSINESS RISKS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDES, IN ADDITION TO CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORKS, EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE

PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS. WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST MARKETS. AS A RESULT, OTHER CARD ISSUERS MAY BE ABLE TO

BENEFIT FROM THE STRONG POSITION AND MARKETING AND PRICING POWER OF VISA AND MASTERCARD. BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW

A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH US BEING ACQUIRED BY AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH A COMPETITOR,

RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL LOSS OF BUSINESS FOR US. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG ALL ISSUERS

REMAINS INTENSE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE

OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION OR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE

THREATS. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE MORE EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE ARE. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY MAY DECLINE.

WE FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND

SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON HIGH REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR

BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR

LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MARKET PRESSURE TO REDUCE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. THIS PRESSURE ARISES, IN PART, DUE TO THE REGULATORY PRESSURE ON OUR COMPETITORS OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS BEEN INCREASING. IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE WE CHARGE MERCHANTS OR ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN PREMIUM MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES ON OUR CARDS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING OVERALL VOLUME

GROWTH OR AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO INCREASE CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS OR MANAGE THE COSTS OF OUR CARDMEMBER BENEFITS INTENDED TO STIMULATE SUCH USE.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT

SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND INCREASE

REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS, AND IS IMPACTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS BEYOND OUR CONTROL THAT REDUCE OUR CARDMEMBERS SPENDING, SUCH AS THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AFFECTING GLOBAL MARKETS. INCREASING REVENUES ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER ATTRITION, INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE, AND CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON OUR NETWORK, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. ONE OF THE

WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH

OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE INSTITUTED REWARDS PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS, AND ISSUERS MAY IN THE FUTURE INSTITUTE REWARDS PROGRAMS THAT ARE MORE

ATTRACTIVE TO CARDMEMBERS THAN OUR PROGRAMS. IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING OR IN MANAGING THE COSTS OF OUR CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE

CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE, TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG EXISTING AND

POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR

RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR LITIGATION AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL

DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES STORE

CARDMEMBER ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. CRIMINALS ARE USING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

ACCOUNTS, TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT. AS OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION BECOME A MORE ACCEPTABLE AND COMMON WAY OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED IN PROCESSING

TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS. IF DATA BREACHES OR FRAUD LEVELS INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE, IT COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE) AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE

USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A

VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF DOWNTURNS IN THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS AND CONSOLIDATIONS OF OUR

PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO

DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COSTCO AND DELTA AIR LINES TO OFFER CO-BRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY INDUSTRIES, MOST NOTABLY THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS AND IN RECENT YEARS

HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. IN ADDITION, UNDER SOME TYPES OF THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN

CO-BRAND PARTNERS, MERCHANTS, VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT

PARTICULAR CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE WERE OBLIGATED TO OR ELECTED TO REIMBURSE CARDMEMBERS FOR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES PURCHASED FROM MERCHANTS THAT ARE BANKRUPT OR HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS.

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THERE COULD BE CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED

STATES. WE WOULD NOT EXPECT CONSOLIDATION TO HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR MERCHANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AIRLINES. HOWEVER, AIRLINES ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE PARTNERS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. IF A

PARTICIPATING AIRLINE MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION. SIMILARLY, IF ONE OF OUR CO-BRAND AIRLINE PARTNERS MERGED WITH AN

AIRLINE THAT HAD A COMPETING CO-BRAND CARD, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH CO-BRAND CARDS IT WOULD OFFER. IF A SURVIVING AIRLINE DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW FROM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS OR TO CEASE OFFERING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CO-BRAND

CARD, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA AND GENERAL RISKS RELATED TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEWEXPOSURE TO AIRLINE INDUSTRY ON PAGES 56-57 OF

OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL

INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE SUCCESSFUL, AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED.

WE HAVE

REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS (INCLUDING THE REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS

MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS), ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS

VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET

TO SAVE COSTS AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE

CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS, SETTLEMENT RISK WITH REGARD TO GNS PARTNERS, MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES, THE RATE OF BANKRUPTCIES, AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS WHICH CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND

CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE

ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, PRINCIPALLY FROM CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND OUR OTHER CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM MERCHANTS AND GNS PARTNERS. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK. RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE

US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN

ADDITION, THE INFORMATION THAT WE USE IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE

BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO

74

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD BUSINESS AND IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT

THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST YIELD, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL.

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT READILY

MARKETABLE, INCLUDING THE VALUATION OF THE INTEREST-ONLY STRIP (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE I/O STRIP) ARISING FROM OUR SECURITIZATION OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. LIQUIDITY RISK IS DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO ACCESS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND SATISFY OUR

OBLIGATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK, WE MAY MAINTAIN TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY, WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND LIMIT FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, OR WE MAY BE TOO ILLIQUID, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING A LIQUIDITY

EVENT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK, SEE 

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL



ABOVE.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT

ACHIEVING OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO FAILED PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OR FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS. OPERATIONAL RISKS INCLUDE THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT COMPLY WITH SPECIFIC REGULATORY OR LEGAL

REQUIREMENTS, EXPOSING US TO FINES AND/OR PENALTIES AND POSSIBLY BRAND DAMAGE; EMPLOYEE ERROR OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT THAT RESULTS IN A MATERIAL FINANCIAL MISSTATEMENT; OR A FAILURE TO MONITOR AN OUTSOURCE PARTNERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE

LEVEL AGREEMENT, RESULTING IN ECONOMIC HARM TO US.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. SEE



FINANCIAL REVIEWRISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 42-46 OF OUR 2008 ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES TO RECORD PROPERLY AND VERIFY A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS, AND THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE.

IF OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE DISRUPTED OR WE ARE UNABLE TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS EFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL, OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY WOULD BE MATERIALLY REDUCED.

OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER LOSS,

DISRUPTIONS IN LONG DISTANCE OR LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACCESS, FRAUD, TERRORISM OR ACCIDENT. A NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER PROBLEM AT OUR FACILITIES COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE TIMELY

TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER FAILS TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION, TERRORISM OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE

COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF OUR BRANDS RELIABILITY AND MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY.

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE OPERATE A SERVICE NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD PARTY VENDORS MANY OF THE

COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THIS OUTSOURCING OCCURS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL

OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DECREASES OUR CONTROL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF CERTAIN OUTSOURCINGS WILL DECREASE AS THE

DEMAND FOR THESE SERVICES INCREASES AROUND THE WORLD.

PROPERTIES

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE IN

A 51-STORY, 2.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT BUILDING LOCATED IN LOWER MANHATTAN. THIS BUILDING, WHICH IS ON LAND LEASED FROM THE BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY FOR A TERM EXPIRING IN 2069, IS ONE OF FOUR OFFICE BUILDINGS IN A COMPLEX KNOWN AS THE WORLD

FINANCIAL CENTER. WE HAVE A 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. BROOKFIELD FINANCIAL PROPERTIES OWNS THE REMAINING 51% INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. WE ALSO LEASE SPACE IN THE BUILDING FROM BROOKFIELD.

OTHER OWNED OR LEASED PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS INCLUDE: THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE CENTERS IN FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA; PHOENIX, ARIZONA; GREENSBORO, NORTH

CAROLINA; AND SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH; THE AMERICAN EXPRESS DATA CENTERS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA AND IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA; THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCE CENTER IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA; THE HEADQUARTERS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICES EUROPE LIMITED IN

LONDON, ENGLAND; THE AMEX CANADA INC. HEADQUARTERS IN MARKHAM, ONTARIO, CANADA; AND SERVICE CENTERS LOCATED IN MEXICO CITY, MEXICO; SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA; GURGAON, INDIA AND BRIGHTON, UNITED KINGDOM.

DURING 2004 AND 2005, WE ENGAGED IN SEVERAL SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE SOLD VARIOUS OWNED PROPERTIES TO THIRD PARTIES AND LEASED

BACK THE PROPERTIES UNDER LONG-TERM NET LEASES WHEREBY EACH AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITY THAT LEASES BACK THE PROPERTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, UTILITIES, OPERATING EXPENSES AND

INSURANCE COSTS) IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL RENT. THE SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS HAVE NOT MATERIALLY IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY YEAR. GAINS RESULTING FROM COMPLETED SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE INITIAL TEN-YEAR LEASE

PERIODS. WE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER WHETHER SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER PROPERTIES THAT WE CURRENTLY OWN.

IN

FEBRUARY 2000, WE ENTERED INTO A TEN-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH CB RICHARD ELLIS, INC., FORMERLY KNOWN AS TRAMMELL CROW CORPORATE SERVICES, INC., FOR FACILITIES, PROJECT AND TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT AND OTHER RELATED SERVICES. THE AGREEMENT COVERS NORTH AND

SOUTH AMERICA AND PARTS OF EUROPE AND ASIA.

GENERALLY, WE LEASE THE PREMISES WE OCCUPY IN OTHER LOCATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FACILITIES

WE OWN OR OCCUPY SUIT OUR NEEDS AND ARE WELL MAINTAINED.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO EACH OF

THESE ACTIONS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY. IN THE COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS, INFORMATION GATHERING REQUESTS, SUBPOENAS, INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT A PARTY TO, NOR ARE ANY OF ITS PROPERTIES THE SUBJECT OF, ANY PENDING LEGAL, ARBITRATION, REGULATORY, TAX OR INVESTIGATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD AS THE PROCEEDINGS ARE RESOLVED. CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE

COMPANY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

CORPORATE MATTERS

BEGINNING IN MID-JULY 2002, 12 PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. IN OCTOBER 2002, THESE CASES WERE CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE AMERICAN

EXPRESS COMPANY SECURITIES LITIGATION

. THESE LAWSUITS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND THE COMMON LAW IN CONNECTION WITH ALLEGED MISSTATEMENTS REGARDING CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN HIGH-YIELD BONDS AND WRITE-DOWNS IN THE

2000-2001 TIMEFRAME. THE PURPORTED CLASS COVERS THE PERIOD FROM JULY 26, 1999 TO JULY 17, 2001. THE ACTIONS SEEK UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AS WELL AS DISGORGEMENT, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS, AND

INTEREST. ON MARCH 31, 2004, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE LAWSUIT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE DISMISSAL TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. IN AUGUST 2006, THE COURT OF

APPEALS, WITHOUT EXPRESSING ANY VIEWS WHATSOEVER ON THE MERITS OF THE CASES, VACATED THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT AND REMANDED ALL CLAIMS TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ON

JANUARY 5, 2007. THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT, WHICH MOTION WAS GRANTED IN SEPTEMBER 2008. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THE DISMISSAL.

IN JANUARY 2006, A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED

PAULA KRITZMAN, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED V. AMERICAN

EXPRESS RETIREMENT PLAN ET AL.

WAS FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE PLAINTIFF ALLEGES THAT WHEN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT PLAN (THE AXP PLAN) WAS AMENDED EFFECTIVE JULY 1,

1995, TO CONVERT FROM A FINAL AVERAGE PAY FORMULA TO A CASH BALANCE FORMULA FOR THE CALCULATION OF BENEFITS, THE TERMS OF THE AMENDED AXP PLAN VIOLATED THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT, AS AMENDED (ERISA), IN AT LEAST THE

FOLLOWING WAYS: (I) THE AXP PLAN VIOLATED ERISAS PROHIBITION ON REDUCING RATES OF BENEFIT ACCRUAL DUE TO THE INCREASING AGE OF A PLAN PARTICIPANT; (II) THE AXP PLAN VIOLATED ERISAS PROHIBITION ON FORFEITURE OF ACCRUED

BENEFITS; AND (III) THE AXP PLAN VIOLATED ERISAS PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION RULES. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS, AMONG OTHER REMEDIES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ENTITLING THE PLAINTIFF AND THE PURPORTED CLASS TO BENEFITS THAT ARE THE GREATER OF

(X) THE BENEFITS TO WHICH THE MEMBERS OF THE CLASS WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONVERSION OF THE BENEFIT PAYOUT FORMULA OF THE AXP PLAN TO A CASH BALANCE FORMULA AND (Y) THE BENEFITS UNDER THE AXP PLAN WITH REGARD TO THE

CASH BALANCE FORMULA. THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS PRE- AND POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST AND ATTORNEYS FEES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY HAS FILED A MOTION WITH THE COURT SEEKING TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT. IN JULY 2008, THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED A DECISION IN A CASE NOT INVOLVING AMERICAN EXPRESS, CAPTIONED

HIRT V. EQUITABLE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES, MANAGERS AND AGENTS

, FINDING THAT CASH BALANCE PLANS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON

AGE. IN LIGHT OF THE SECOND CIRCUITS DECISION IN THE

HIRT

CASE, THE

KRITZMAN

PLAINTIFFS HAVE VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THEIR COMPLAINT.

IN MAY 2008, A SHAREHOLDERS DERIVATIVE SUIT WAS FILED IN NEW YORK STATE SUPREME COURT IN MANHATTAN NAMING AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES AS

DEFENDANTS. THE CASE CAPTIONED AS

CITY OF TALLAHASSEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM V. AKERSON ET AL.

ALLEGES BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTY ARISING FROM KNOWING BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS BY CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF

VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL BANK DEFENDANTS, MASTERCARD WAS THE SOLE REMAINING DEFENDANT IN THE LAWSUIT. ON JUNE 24, 2008, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND MASTERCARD INCORPORATED TO DROP ALL CLAIMS

AGAINST MASTERCARD. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT MASTERCARD HAS AGREED TO PAY A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF $1.8 BILLION TO THE COMPANY, CONSISTING OF 12 QUARTERLY PAYMENTS OF UP TO $150 MILLION PER QUARTER COMMENCING WITH THE QUARTER ENDING

PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT ONLY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF BUT HAVE SINCE AMENDED THEIR COMPLAINT TO ALSO SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES. THESE PLAINTIFFS HAVE AGREED THAT A STAY WOULD BE IMPOSED WITH REGARD TO THEIR RESPECTIVE ACTIONS PENDING THE APPEAL OF THE

COURTS ARBITRATION RULING DISCUSSED ABOVE. GIVEN THE RECENT RULING OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT (DISCUSSED ABOVE), THE STAY HAS BEEN LIFTED, AND AMERICAN EXPRESSS RESPONSE TO THE COMPLAINT IS DUE IN APRIL 2009. PLAINTIFFS HAVE ALSO FILED AN

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ). A CID IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IN THE COURSE OF A CIVIL INVESTIGATION AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE THE COMMENCEMENT OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. THE DOJ IS PERMITTED BY STATUTE TO ISSUE A CID TO ANYONE WHOM IT BELIEVES MAY

HAVE INFORMATION RELEVANT TO AN INVESTIGATION. THE RECEIPT OF A CID DOES NOT PRESUPPOSE THAT THERE IS PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT A VIOLATION OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS HAS OCCURRED OR THAT A FORMAL COMPLAINT ULTIMATELY WILL BE FILED. THE DOJ HAS

REQUESTED THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS POLICIES RELATING TO MERCHANT SURCHARGING AND ITS ANTI-STEERING POLICIES THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE CARD IN FAVOR OF OTHER

THE PARTIES TO AGREE ON WHETHER AN AUDIT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER AEME WAS UNDERPAID OR OVERPAID FOR THE YEARS IN QUESTION BASED ON SUCH FORMULA. THOUGH THE PARTIES HAVE NOT FINISHED THEIR DISCUSSIONS ON THIS ISSUE, TRS BELIEVES

THAT AMOUNTS OWED BY IT, IF ANY, UNDER THE FORMULA MANDATED BY THE LCIA WILL NOT BE MATERIAL.
