ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY (INCLUDING ITS SUBSIDIARIES, UNLESS THE

CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE, THE "COMPANY") WAS FOUNDED IN 1850 AS A JOINT STOCK

ASSOCIATION AND WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN

1965. THE COMPANY IS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING TRAVEL

RELATED SERVICES, FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND INTERNATIONAL BANKING SERVICES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.*

TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES

-----------------------

AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. (INCLUDING ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE, "TRS") PROVIDES A VARIETY

OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, GLOBAL CARD NETWORK,

ISSUING AND PROCESSING SERVICES, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) CARD, THE OPTIMA(R)

CARD, A NUMBER OF COBRANDED CARDS, AND OTHER CONSUMER AND CORPORATE LENDING AND

BANKING PRODUCTS, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) TRAVELERS CHEQUE, STORED VALUE

PRODUCTS, BUSINESS EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, CORPORATE AND

CONSUMER TRAVEL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TAX PREPARATION AND BUSINESS PLANNING

SERVICES, MAGAZINE PUBLISHING, AND MERCHANT TRANSACTION PROCESSING, POINT OF

SALE AND BACK OFFICE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. TRS OFFERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN

MORE THAN 200 COUNTRIES. IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, PARTLY OWNED AFFILIATES AND

UNAFFILIATED ENTITIES OFFER SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER LICENSES

FROM TRS.

TRS' BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATION, ALTHOUGH TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES OUTSTANDING

TEND TO BE GREATEST EACH YEAR IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD

QUARTER, AND CARD-BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS.

TRS PLACES SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON ITS TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS

AND DILIGENTLY PROTECTS ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

-----------------------

TRS OPERATES A GLOBAL GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK. NETWORK FUNCTIONS

INCLUDE OPERATIONS, SERVICE DELIVERY, SYSTEMS, AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING,

SETTLEMENT, AND MARKETING; THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS FOR

THE NETWORK; AND ESTABLISHING AND ENHANCING MILLIONS OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH

MERCHANTS GLOBALLY, BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE. ONE OF THE KEY ASSETS OF TRS'

NETWORK IS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST HIGHLY

-------------------------------------

*VARIOUS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE MADE IN THIS 10-K ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH

GENERALLY INCLUDE THE WORDS "BELIEVE," "EXPECT," "ANTICIPATE," "OPTIMISTIC,"

"INTEND," "AIM," "WILL," "SHOULD" AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS. CERTAIN FACTORS THAT

MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED ON PAGES 35-38.

1

RECOGNIZED AND RESPECTED BRANDS. CARDS BEARING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS LOGO

("CARDS") ARE ISSUED BY QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS AND ARE ACCEPTED AT AUTOMATED

TELLER MACHINES ("ATMS") AND AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD.

GLOBALLY, THE COMPANY MANAGES BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH

MERCHANTS THROUGH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND THE CARD ISSUING SIDE OF THE

BUSINESS. THIS "CLOSED LOOP," WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK

FROM THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, PROVIDES A RICH SOURCE OF INFORMATION AT BOTH ENDS

OF THE CARD TRANSACTION AND ENABLES TRS TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING

OPPORTUNITIES FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY

OF CHANNELS.

TRS IS THE LARGEST ISSUER OF CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL

NETWORK. IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, THERE WERE 70 ARRANGEMENTS IN

PLACE WITH BANKS AND OTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS IN 74 COUNTRIES PROVIDING FOR

CARD ISSUANCE BY THOSE ENTITIES. THESE PARTNERSHIPS CREATE MORE AMERICAN EXPRESS

BRANDED CARDS IN FORCE, DRIVE MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME THROUGH THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS MERCHANT NETWORK, AND SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE REACH OF THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS BRAND. GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES PARTNERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED 1.4 MILLION NEW

MERCHANT OUTLETS, A SIGNIFICANT ADDITION TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL

MERCHANT BASE. AMONG THE NEW AGREEMENTS ANNOUNCED IN 2000 FOR CARDS TO BE ISSUED

ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL NETWORK WERE THOSE WITH DEUTSCHE BANK ITALIA

(ITALY); AEON CREDIT SERVICE (ASIA) CO., LTD., IN ARGENTINA: BANCO RIO DE LA

PLATA, S.A.; BANCO DE LA PROVINCIA DE BUENOS AIRES; BANCO BANSUD, S.A.; HONG

LEONG BANK (MALAYSIA); AND TATA FINANCE LTD. (INDIA), AMONG OTHERS. SOME OF THE

OTHER ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS, BUT THE VAST

MAJORITY HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED SINCE 1995. IN MAY 1996, THE COMPANY INVITED

BANKS AND OTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES TO BEGIN ISSUING

CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. IN 1997, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED GLOBAL

NETWORK SERVICES TO MANAGE ITS NETWORK BUSINESS, BRINGING INCREASED FOCUS AND

RESOURCES TO THIS AREA. GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES CONTINUED TO SHOW STRONG GROWTH

IN BILLED BUSINESS IN 2000.

TO DATE, THE ONLY ISSUERS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK IN THE UNITED

STATES ARE TRS AND A UNITED KINGDOM FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH NO OTHER CARD

ISSUING ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS THE RESULT OF RULES AND

POLICIES OF VISA USA, INC. AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INCORPORATED

("MASTERCARD") IN THE UNITED STATES CALLING FOR EXPULSION OF MEMBERS WHO ISSUE

AMERICAN EXPRESS BRANDED CARDS. NO BANKS HAVE BEEN WILLING TO FORFEIT MEMBERSHIP

IN VISA USA, INC. AND/OR MASTERCARD TO ISSUE CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK. IN A LAWSUIT FILED ON OCTOBER 7, 1998, AGAINST VISA USA, INC. AND VISA

INTERNATIONAL CORP. (COLLECTIVELY, "VISA") AND MASTERCARD, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT

OF JUSTICE ALLEGED THAT THESE RULES AND POLICIES VIOLATE THE ANTITRUST LAWS OF

THE UNITED STATES. THE TRIAL OF THIS LAWSUIT CONCLUDED IN AUGUST 2000, AND

THE TRIAL JUDGE HAS NOT YET RENDERED A DECISION.

AS A NETWORK, TRS ENCOUNTERS INTENSE WORLDWIDE COMPETITION FROM OTHER

CARD NETWORKS LIKE VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB, THE DISCOVER/NOVUS NETWORK OF

MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER & CO. (U.S. ONLY) AND JCB. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE

FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK BUSINESS ARE (I) THE NUMBER OF CARDS IN FORCE

AND EXTENT OF SPENDING DONE WITH THESE CARDS; (II) THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF

ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT THE CARDS; (III) THE SUCCESS OF TARGETED MARKETING

2

AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; (IV) REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION; (V)

THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES COST

EFFECTIVELY ON A GLOBAL BASIS; (VI) THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT

INNOVATIVE TYPES OF CARD PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND ISSUERS

AND ACQUIRERS ON THE NETWORK; (VII) SUCCESS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGIES TO

REDUCE SUPPRESSION -- WHEN MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS ENCOURAGE A CUSTOMER TO

USE ANOTHER CARD OR CASH; AND (VIII) THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

SYSTEMS.

CONSUMER CARD, SMALL BUSINESS AND CONSUMER TRAVEL SERVICES

----------------------------------------------------------

TRS AND ITS LICENSEES OFFER INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS CHARGE CARDS SUCH AS

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) CARD, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) GOLD CARD, THE PLATINUM

CARD(R) AND THE ULTRA-PREMIUM CENTURION(SM) CARD; REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS SUCH AS

THE OPTIMA(R) CARD, BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS(SM), THE DELTA SKYMILES(R) CREDIT

CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, AND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) CREDIT CARD, AMONG

OTHERS; AND A VARIETY OF CARDS SPONSORED BY AND COBRANDED WITH OTHER

CORPORATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS. CARDS ARE CURRENTLY ISSUED IN OVER 50 CURRENCIES

(INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY BANKS AND OTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS) AND PERMIT

CARDMEMBERS TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN

MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT ESTABLISHMENTS THAT HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT

CARDS, AND TO ACCESS CASH THROUGH AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES AT MORE THAN 500,000

LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE.

CHARGE CARDS, WHICH ARE MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER

COUNTRIES AND CARRY NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A

METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR

SERVICES. CHARGES ARE APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A

CARDMEMBER'S ACCOUNT HISTORY, CREDIT RECORD AND PERSONAL RESOURCES. EXCEPT IN

THE CASE OF EXTENDED PAYMENT PLANS (SUCH AS SIGN & TRAVEL(R) AND THE EXTENDED

PAYMENT OPTION), CHARGE CARDS REQUIRE PAYMENT BY THE CARDMEMBER OF THE FULL

AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH, AND NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED. CHARGE CARD

ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY

ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE CANCELLED.

TRS AND ITS LICENSEES ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS IN

THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE CARDS HAVE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT

PAYMENT TERMS, GRACE PERIODS AND RATE AND FEE STRUCTURES. TRS CONTINUES TO

EXPAND ITS CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES IN KEY MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S.,

PRIMARILY THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION AND INCREASED DISTRIBUTION OF NEW REVOLVING

CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK ("CENTURION BANK"), A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF TRS, ISSUES THE OPTIMA CARD, BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ALL

OTHER AMERICAN EXPRESS BRANDED REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES AND

OWNS MOST OF THE RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THESE CARDS. IN ADDITION,

CENTURION BANK HAS OUTSTANDING LINES OF CREDIT IN ASSOCIATION WITH CERTAIN

CHARGE CARDS AND OFFERS UNSECURED LOANS TO CARDMEMBERS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS

SIGN & TRAVEL AND EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION PROGRAMS. THE SIGN & TRAVEL PROGRAM

GIVES QUALIFIED UNITED STATES CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDED PAYMENTS FOR

AIRLINE, CRUISE AND CERTAIN TRAVEL CHARGES THAT ARE PURCHASED WITH THE CHARGE

CARD. THE EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION OFFERS QUALIFIED UNITED STATES CARDMEMBERS THE

OPTION OF EXTENDING PAYMENT FOR CERTAIN CHARGES ON THE CHARGE CARD IN EXCESS OF

A SPECIFIED AMOUNT.

3

CENTURION BANK IS ALSO THE ISSUER FOR CERTAIN CHARGE CARDS. IT ALSO

OFFERS MEMBERSHIP B@NKING(R) -- AN ONLINE BANKING SERVICE THAT PROVIDES

CONSUMERS WITH HIGH-VALUE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ATM ACCESS WITH REBATES ON

SURCHARGES FROM OTHER BANKS, COMPETITIVE RATES ON DEPOSITS AND THE CONVENIENCE

OF BANKING BY THE INTERNET, TELEPHONE, ATM OR MAIL. DURING 2000, MEMBERSHIP

B@NKING CONTINUED TO GROW, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WEBSITE STABILITY IMPROVED.

TO HELP FURTHER EXPAND ITS FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES GLOBALLY, THE COMPANY

FORMED THE GLOBAL BROKERAGE AND MEMBERSHIP B@NKING UNIT. THIS UNIT WILL WORK

CLOSELY WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND TRS' CARD BUSINESS IN BOTH

THE UNITED STATES AND SELECT INTERNATIONAL MARKETS TO BETTER REACH CONSUMERS

THROUGH A NUMBER OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS WITH A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS.

CENTURION BANK'S DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION ("FDIC") UP TO $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR. CENTURION BANK IS A

UTAH-CHARTERED INDUSTRIAL LOAN COMPANY REGULATED, SUPERVISED AND REGULARLY

EXAMINED BY THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE FDIC.

MANY TRS CARDMEMBERS, PARTICULARLY CHARGE CARD HOLDERS, ARE CHARGED AN

ANNUAL FEE, WHICH VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD, THE NUMBER OF CARDS FOR EACH

ACCOUNT, THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THE CARD IS DENOMINATED AND THE COUNTRY OF

RESIDENCE OF THE CARDMEMBER. MOST REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS ARE OFFERED WITH NO

ANNUAL FEE. EACH CARDMEMBER MUST MEET STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR

CREDITWORTHINESS WHICH ARE APPLIED THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS BOTH AT THE TIME

OF INITIAL SOLICITATION OR APPLICATION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING THE CARD

RELATIONSHIP. THE COMPANY USES SOPHISTICATED CREDIT MODELS AND TECHNIQUES IN ITS

RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS.

TRS IS CONCERNED ABOUT FRAUD THROUGHOUT ITS CARD OPERATIONS.  THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO TAKE MEASURES TO ADDRESS FRAUD ISSUES, INCLUDING INVESTING

IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND EDUCATING CARDMEMBERS THROUGH FRAUD PROTECTION

INITIATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2000, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED PRIVATE

PAYMENTS(SM), A FREE SERVICE THAT ENABLES U.S. CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS

CARDMEMBERS TO USE A RANDOM, UNIQUE CARD NUMBER FOR EACH ONLINE PURCHASE.

CARDMEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS,

DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CARD THEY HAVE AND THEIR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE. THESE

INCLUDE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS(R), GLOBAL ASSIST(R) HOTLINE, BUYER'S ASSURANCE PLAN,

CAR RENTAL LOSS AND DAMAGE INSURANCE PLAN, TRAVEL ACCIDENT INSURANCE, PURCHASE

PROTECTION PLAN, BEST VALUE AND ONLINE SHOPPING GUARANTEES, CUSTOM EXTRAS,

ASSURED RESERVATIONS, AND ONLINE FRAUD PROTECTION GUARANTEE. GOLD CARDMEMBERS IN

THE UNITED STATES HAVE ACCESS TO CERTAIN ADDITIONAL SERVICES, INCLUDING A

YEAR-END SUMMARY OF CHARGES REPORT. THE PLATINUM CARD, OFFERED TO CERTAIN

CARDMEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS OTHER COUNTRIES, PROVIDES ACCESS TO

ADDITIONAL AND ENHANCED TRAVEL, FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, PERSONAL ASSISTANCE AND

OTHER SERVICES. THE CENTURION CARD, OFFERED IN THE UNITED STATES DURING 1999

FOLLOWING A LAUNCH OF ITS PREDECESSOR IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, IS AN ULTRA-PREMIUM

CHARGE CARD PROVIDING HIGHLY PERSONALIZED CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND AN ARRAY OF

4

TRAVEL, LIFESTYLE AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS (AND IN THE U.K., A SMART CHIP ENABLING

ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY IN THE FUTURE). UNDER THE EXPRESS CASH PROGRAM,

ENROLLED CARDMEMBERS CAN OBTAIN CASH OR AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELERS CHEQUES 24

HOURS A DAY FROM AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES WORLDWIDE. PERSONAL, GOLD, PLATINUM

AND CENTURION CARDMEMBERS RECEIVE THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP STATEMENT, WHICH IS

USED TO COMMUNICATE SPECIAL OFFERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF BOTH MERCHANTS

AND THE COMPANY.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TRS,

ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES ("CREDCO"), PURCHASE MOST CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES

ARISING FROM THE USE OF CARDS ISSUED IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN DESIGNATED

CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO FINANCES THE PURCHASE OF

RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE SALE OF

MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK FINANCES ITS REVOLVING CREDIT

RECEIVABLES THROUGH THE SALE OF SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND CERTIFICATES.

TRS AND CENTURION BANK ALSO FUND RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION

PROGRAMS. THE COST OF FUNDING CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR

EXPENSE OF CARD OPERATIONS.

THE CHARGE CARD, ATM AND CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (WHICH GENERALLY

PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION IN THE GRANTING AND HANDLING OF CREDIT); THE FAIR

CREDIT REPORTING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES USE BY CREDITORS OF

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS AND CREDIT PRESCREENING PRACTICES AND REQUIRES CERTAIN

DISCLOSURES WHEN AN APPLICATION FOR CREDIT IS REJECTED); THE TRUTH IN LENDING

ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS UPON

WHICH CREDIT IS GRANTED); THE FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, REGULATES THE MANNER IN WHICH BILLING INQUIRIES ARE HANDLED AND

SPECIFIES CERTAIN BILLING REQUIREMENTS); THE FAIR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD

DISCLOSURE ACT (WHICH MANDATES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ON CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD

APPLICATIONS); AND THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACT (WHICH REGULATES

DISCLOSURES AND SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS

INCLUDING THOSE AT ATMS). CERTAIN FEDERAL PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS

GOVERN THE COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

(SEE PAGE 34). FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION

PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR

CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION, DISCLOSURE AND PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS. THE APPLICATION

OF FEDERAL AND STATE BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS AFFECT THE COMPANY TO THE

EXTENT SUCH LAWS RESULT IN AMOUNTS OWED BEING CLASSIFIED AS DELINQUENT AND/OR

CHARGED OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE. CENTURION BANK IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF STATE

AND FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FDIC-INSURED, STATE-CHARTERED

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATION THEREOF COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH CENTURION BANK CONDUCTS

ITS BUSINESS.

IN 2000, TRS CONTINUED TO DEEPEN ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CORE

CARDMEMBERS AND GAINED A GREATER SHARE OF THE PLASTIC SPENDING OF ITS CUSTOMERS.

TRS ALSO MAINTAINED ITS FOCUS ON ACQUIRING NEW CARDMEMBERS. BILLED BUSINESS IN

THE UNITED STATES GREW AS CARDMEMBERS INCREASED THEIR USE OF CARDS FOR EVERYDAY

SPENDING AT SUPERMARKETS, DRUGSTORES, GAS STATIONS AND FOR PAYING UTILITY BILLS,

ROAD TOLLS AND FEDERAL TAXES. IN ADDITION, NEW CARD ACQUISITIONS HAD STRONG

GROWTH. THE NUMBER OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES INCREASED, AND

CONSUMER CHARGE CARDS GREW FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE YEAR AFTER NEARLY A DECADE

OF DECLINES. TRS ALSO SELECTIVELY EXPANDED THE SIZE OF CREDIT LINES AND

ENCOURAGED CARDMEMBERS TO TRANSFER OUTSTANDING BALANCES FROM OTHER CARD ISSUERS.

TRS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ITS LENDING BALANCES AND CONTINUED TO CAPTURE A

GREATER SHARE OF INDUSTRY CREDIT CARD LENDING BALANCES.

5

TWO OF THE PRODUCTS LAUNCHED BY TRS IN THE UNITED STATES IN 1999 MADE

SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS RESULTS IN 2000, EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS IN

TERMS OF SPENDING AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE. FIRST, BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS IS

THE FIRST WIDELY MARKETED CREDIT CARD IN THE UNITED STATES WITH AN EMBEDDED

SMART CHIP, CURRENTLY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE ADDED SECURITY AND REWARDS AND TO HELP

FACILITATE PURCHASES USING THE INTERNET. TRS IS ACTIVELY PURSUING ADDITIONAL

APPLICATIONS FOR THE CHIP. SECOND, THE COBRANDED CARDS LAUNCHED WITH COSTCO WERE

EXCEPTIONAL ADDITIONS TO TRS' U.S. PORTFOLIO. AT YEAR-END 2000, TRS HAD ISSUED

MORE THAN TWO MILLION BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND OVER ONE MILLION

COSTCO CONSUMER CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE. ADDITIONAL NEW CARD PRODUCTS

INCLUDE THE HILTON HHONORS(R) PLATINUM CREDIT CARD AND BLUE FOR BUSINESS(SM), A

CREDIT CARD FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAS A COMPUTER CHIP AND DESIGN SIMILAR TO

BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND OFFERS EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNTS ON SERVICES FROM

CERTAIN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. DURING THE YEAR, TRS ALSO RENEWED ITS

COBRAND CARD AGREEMENT WITH DELTA AIRLINES AND LAUNCHED THE DELTA SKYMILES

CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS WITH THE ALWAYS DOUBLE MILES(SM) FEATURE.

ALWAYS DOUBLE MILES ENABLES CURRENT AND NEW CARDMEMBERS TO EARN TWO SKYMILES FOR

EVERY ELIGIBLE DOLLAR CHARGED TO THE CARD FOR PURCHASES MADE AT SUPERMARKETS,

GAS STATIONS, DRUGSTORES, HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES, THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE,

WIRELESS PHONE BILLS AND DELTA PURCHASES.

TRS HAS BEEN EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF GROWING ITS BUSINESS THROUGH

ACQUISITION OF CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS. DURING THE LATTER PART OF 2000, TRS

SIGNED AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE THE SHOPRITE COBRAND PORTFOLIO WITH APPROXIMATELY

$70 MILLION IN RECEIVABLES, AND THE BANK OF HAWAII PORTFOLIO WITH APPROXIMATELY

$226 MILLION IN RECEIVABLES. TRS INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO

ACQUIRE CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS AS THEY ARISE.

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, TRS HAS EXPANDED ITS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM TO INCLUDE A BROADER RANGE OF TRAVEL REWARDS AND RETAIL MERCHANDISE AND

GOURMET GIFTS. LOYALTY PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, WITH MORE THAN EIGHT

MILLION ENROLLEES WORLDWIDE, ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN INCREASING CARDMEMBER RETENTION

AND PROFITABILITY. IN THE UNITED STATES, MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ENROLLEES HAVE 54

PERCENT LOWER ATTRITION, SPEND AN AVERAGE OF 40 PERCENT MORE IN THE FIRST YEAR

OF ENROLLMENT, HAVE HALF THE CREDIT LOSS RATES OF NON-ENROLLEES, AND PAY THEIR

BILLS FASTER. IN ADDITION, THE AVERAGE PROFITABILITY OF EACH MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

ENROLLEE IS MORE THAN FIVE TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF A NON-ENROLLEE. MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS ENROLLEES NOW REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING.

TRS MAKES PAYMENTS TO MERCHANTS PURSUANT TO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

WHEN CARDMEMBERS REDEEM THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS AND ESTABLISHES RESERVES

IN CONNECTION WITH ESTIMATED FUTURE REDEMPTIONS. DUE TO HIGHER CHARGE VOLUMES

AND REWARD REDEMPTION RATES, THE COST OF MEMBERSHIP REWARDS HAS INCREASED OVER

THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND CONTINUES TO GROW. DURING 2000, TRS ENHANCED THE

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM BY ALLOWING ENROLLEES TO REDEEM THEIR POINTS VIA THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS WEBSITE IN REAL TIME, THEREBY INCREASING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

WHILE LOWERING CALL VOLUME AND RELATED PROCESSING COSTS. TRS WILL CONTINUE TO

SEEK WAYS TO CONTAIN THE OVERALL COST OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE

ITS VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS.

6

SERVICES OFFERED FOR A FEE TO CARDMEMBERS INCLUDE TRAVEL, ACCIDENT AND

CREDIT INSURANCE PRODUCTS, A CARD REGISTRY AND REPLACEMENT SERVICE, CREDIT

BUREAU MONITORING AND TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES. ADDITIONAL SERVICES INCLUDE A

SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE FOR MAGAZINES, A PRE-PAID LEGAL SERVICE AND VARIOUS

MERCHANDISE-RELATED OFFERINGS.

TRS CONTINUES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ITS CARD PROCESSING

SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW FASTER INTRODUCTION AND GREATER CUSTOMIZATION

OF PRODUCTS. TRS ALSO IS UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE ITS SERVICE

CAPABILITIES.

TRS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION

WORLDWIDE WITH RESPECT TO THE CARD ISSUING BUSINESS. AS A CARD ISSUER, TRS

COMPETES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIGROUP, FIRST USA BANK, MBNA,

CHASE MANHATTAN, PROVIDIAN FINANCIAL, CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL AND BANK OF AMERICA)

THAT ARE MEMBERS OF VISA AND/OR MASTERCARD AND THAT ISSUE GENERAL PURPOSE CARDS,

PRIMARILY UNDER REVOLVING CREDIT PLANS, ON ONE OR BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS, AND THE

MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER & CO. AFFILIATE THAT ISSUES THE DISCOVER CARD ON THE

DISCOVER/NOVUS NETWORK. TRS ALSO ENCOUNTERS SOME VERY LIMITED COMPETITION FROM

BUSINESSES THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR

CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS ARE

NOT GENERALLY SUBSTITUTES FOR TRS' CARDS DUE TO THEIR LIMITED ACCEPTANCE.

NUMEROUS UNITED STATES BANKS ISSUING CREDIT CARDS UNDER REVOLVING

CREDIT PLANS CHARGE ANNUAL FEES IN ADDITION TO INTEREST CHARGES WHERE PERMITTED

BY STATE LAW. HOWEVER, THE ISSUER OF THE DISCOVER CARD, AS WELL AS MANY ISSUERS

OF VISA CARDS AND MASTERCARD CARDS, GENERALLY CHARGE NO ANNUAL FEES.

COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO

ATTRACT CARDHOLDERS INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF

CREDIT, AIRLINE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS AND OTHER REWARD OR

REBATE PROGRAMS, "TEASER" PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CARD ACQUISITION

AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND COBRANDED ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER

BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS. THE TREND OF MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING

AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR

CARD ISSUERS HAS CONTINUED, RESULTING IN SOME ISSUERS BECOMING EVEN LARGER, WITH

GREATER RESOURCES, ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND BRAND RECOGNITION TO COMPETE -- AND A

SMALLER NUMBER OF DOMINANT ISSUERS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR POINT-OF-SALE

PURCHASES HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE AS MANY BANKS HAVE REPLACED ATM CARDS WITH

GENERAL PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE VISA OR MASTERCARD LOGO. TRS DOES

NOT CURRENTLY OFFER POINT-OF-SALE DEBIT CARD PRODUCTS IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE CARD ISSUING BUSINESS

ARE (I) THE FEATURES AND THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

REWARDS PROGRAMS PROVIDED TO CARDMEMBERS; (II) THE NUMBER, SPENDING

CHARACTERISTICS AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF CARDMEMBERS; (III) THE QUANTITY AND

QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT A CARD; (IV) THE COST OF CARDS TO

CARDMEMBERS; (V) THE TERMS OF PAYMENT AVAILABLE TO CARDMEMBERS; (VI) THE NUMBER

AND QUALITY OF OTHER PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO CARDMEMBERS; (VII) THE

NATURE AND QUALITY OF EXPENSE MANAGEMENT DATA CAPTURE AND REPORTING CAPABILITY;

(VIII) THE SUCCESS OF TARGETED MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; (IX)

REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION; AND (X) THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS TO IMPLEMENT

OPERATIONAL AND COST EFFICIENCIES.

7

TRS, THROUGH ITS SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES GROUP ("SBS"), IS ALSO A

LEADING PROVIDER OF FINANCIAL AND TRAVEL SERVICES TO SMALL BUSINESSES (I.E.,

GENERALLY LESS THAN 100 EMPLOYEES AND/OR SALES OF $10 MILLION OR LESS). SBS

CONTINUED TO ACHIEVE STRONG GROWTH DURING THE YEAR AS DEMONSTRATED BY

YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN SPENDING ON CARDS, LOANS OUTSTANDING AND THE TOTAL

NUMBER OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ISSUED TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THIS GROWTH

HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY CUSTOMER RESPONSE TO THE SMALL BUSINESS VERSIONS OF A

NUMBER OF TRS' CONSUMER CARD PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARDS

FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, OPTIMA CARDS AND, MOST RECENTLY, COSTCO AND BLUE FOR

BUSINESS CARDS.

SBS IS THE NUMBER ONE CARD ISSUER AND ONE OF THE LARGEST LENDERS TO

SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, SBS HAS

BROADENED ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO INCLUDE EQUIPMENT LEASING, UNSECURED LINES OF

CREDIT AND TERM LOANS, WHICH ARE ACTIVELY MARKETED TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND

PROSPECTS. IN FEBRUARY 2001, TRS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE

SIERRACITIES.COM INC., AN EQUIPMENT FINANCING COMPANY. SBS IS ALSO

BROADENING AWARENESS OF ITS SERVICES THROUGH NEW INTERNET-BASED SPONSORSHIPS AND

ADVERTISING PROGRAMS. TRS MAINTAINS, AS PART OF AMERICANEXPRESS.COM, THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS SMALL BUSINESS EXCHANGE WEBSITE, THROUGH WHICH IT PROVIDES

SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WITH RELEVANT INFORMATION, EXPERT ADVICE AND CUSTOMER

SERVICING APPLICATIONS.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL BUSINESS HAS THREE SEGMENTS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS-OWNED TRAVEL SERVICE OFFICES; RETAIL OUTLETS OWNED BY AMERICAN

EXPRESS REPRESENTATIVES; AND AMERICAN EXPRESS REMOTE DELIVERY CALL CENTERS,

WHICH OFFER TRAVEL SERVICES TO PLATINUM, CENTURION AND OTHER CARDMEMBERS.

THROUGH THESE FACILITIES, CARDMEMBERS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE SERVICE IN PERSON, BY

PHONE OR BY FAX, IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY'S ONLINE SERVICING. SINCE A LARGE

NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARDMEMBERS ARE ALSO ACTIVE

LEISURE TRAVELERS, TRS SEEKS TO LEVERAGE ITS CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK TO BETTER

SERVE ITS CUSTOMERS AND GROW THE BUSINESS DESPITE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES. SEE PAGES 10-11 FOR A DISCUSSION OF COMPETITION IN THE

TRAVEL INDUSTRY.

TRS' RETAIL TRAVEL NETWORK OF MORE THAN 1,700 TRAVEL AND FOREIGN

EXCHANGE SERVICES LOCATIONS IS IMPORTANT IN SUPPORTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

BRAND AND PROVIDING CUSTOMER SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TRS CONTINUALLY

EVALUATES THIS STRUCTURE TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO LEVERAGE THE STRENGTH OF

THE TRAVEL NETWORK. AT THE SAME TIME, TRS IS DEVELOPING WAYS TO BETTER SERVE THE

TRAVEL CONSUMER, INCLUDING 1-800 TYPE SERVICES AND INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

MERCHANT SERVICES

-----------------

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, TRS' ESTABLISHMENT SERVICES GROUP HAS

FOCUSED ON EXPANDING THE TRS NETWORK OF MERCHANTS AND INCREASING MERCHANT

ACCEPTANCE GLOBALLY, BOTH THROUGH EMPLOYEES AND THIRD-PARTY SALES AGENTS. IN

2000, TRS CONTINUED TO SEE STRONG PROGRESS IN MERCHANT SIGNINGS WORLDWIDE.

DURING THE YEAR, TRS STRENGTHENED ITS MERCHANT COVERAGE IN THE UNITED

STATES IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT, SUPERMARKETS, INSURANCE,

QUICK-SERVICE RESTAURANTS AND BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS. KEY SIGNINGS INCLUDED THE

SUPERMARKETS OF SUPERVALU INC.; JOHN HANCOCK LIFE INSURANCE; ARBY'S; KFC; THE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER AVAYA; AND AIRPORT PARKING LOCATIONS WITHIN

THE THREE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AIRPORTS OPERATED BY THE PORT AUTHORITY OF NEW

YORK AND NEW JERSEY. THE MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES CAN NOW

ACCOMMODATE MORE THAN 95% OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS' GENERAL PURPOSE

PLASTIC SPENDING. TRS' OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE MERCHANT COVERAGE WHEREVER

CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD. IN THE UNITED STATES, TRS ACQUIRES MERCHANTS

THROUGH THREE SALES CHANNELS: A PROPRIETARY SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY SALES

AGENTS AND TELEMARKETING. CARD ACCEPTANCE BY ONLINE MERCHANTS ALSO CONTINUED TO

GROW IN 2000, WITH MOST OF THE TOP 500 U.S. SITES NOW ACCEPTING THE CARD.

AS A MERCHANT PROCESSOR, TRS ACCEPTS AND PROCESSES FROM EACH

PARTICIPATING ESTABLISHMENT THE CHARGES ARISING FROM CARDMEMBER PURCHASES AT A

DISCOUNT THAT VARIES WITH THE TYPE OF PARTICIPATING ESTABLISHMENT, THE CHARGE

VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT TO THE ESTABLISHMENT, THE METHOD OF

SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE AVERAGE CHARGE AMOUNT AND

THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION PROVIDED. AS A RESULT OF TRS' ATTRACTIVE CARDMEMBER

BASE WITH LOYAL, HIGH-SPENDING PERSONAL AND CORPORATE CARDMEMBERS, TRS IS

GENERALLY ABLE TO CHARGE HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES TO PARTICIPATING ESTABLISHMENTS

THAN ITS COMPETITORS. WHILE MANY ESTABLISHMENTS UNDERSTAND THIS PRICING IN

RELATION TO THE VALUE PROVIDED, TRS HAS ENCOUNTERED COMPLAINTS FROM SOME

ESTABLISHMENTS, AS WELL AS SUPPRESSION OF THE CARD'S USE, AND CONTINUES TO

DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES THROUGH BETTER

COMMUNICATION OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS VALUE PROPOSITION AND BY CANCELING

MERCHANTS WHO SUPPRESS USAGE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD.

TRS FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING KEY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE

MERCHANT SATISFACTION, ON EXECUTING PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT

MERCHANTS AND ON STRENGTHENING ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS THROUGH AN

EXPANDED ROSTER OF SERVICES THAT HELP THEM MEET THEIR BUSINESS GOALS. IN 2000,

TRS LAUNCHED THE OFFER ZONE(SM) WHICH CONSOLIDATES AMERICAN EXPRESS AND MERCHANT

OFFERS IN A SINGLE SITE, CREATING A ONE-STOP ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE FOR

CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARDMEMBERS. TRS ALSO CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS RANGE

OF SERVICES DURING THE YEAR TO INCLUDE OTHER INTERNET INITIATIVES TO HELP

MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THEIR BUSINESSES ONLINE. FOR

EXAMPLE, TRS IMPLEMENTED A SUITE OF E-COMMERCE TOOLS TO HELP MERCHANTS IN

VARIOUS STAGES OF THEIR E-COMMERCE LIFECYCLE ESTABLISH AND GROW THEIR WEB

PRESENCE. TRS ALSO INCREASED CAPABILITIES FOR ONLINE SELF-SERVICING THROUGH

WHICH MERCHANTS MAY ACCESS AND UPDATE THEIR ACCOUNT INFORMATION ONLINE.

9

TRS' FOCUS ON RETAIL AND EVERYDAY SPEND CATEGORIES CONTINUED TO

CONTRIBUTE STRONGLY TO BUSINESS GROWTH, WITH EXPANDED MERCHANT COVERAGE IN THESE

CATEGORIES SPURRING STRONG CARDMEMBER SPENDING. IN THE UNITED STATES FROM 1998

THROUGH 2000, TRS' CHARGE VOLUME IN TRAVEL INDUSTRIES GREW 14 PERCENT, COMPARED

WITH GROWTH IN RETAIL OF 48 PERCENT AND IN EVERYDAY SPEND CATEGORIES OF 102

PERCENT.

AT YEAR-END, TRS WAS THE SECOND-LARGEST OWNER/OPERATOR OF ATMS IN THE

UNITED STATES WITH MORE THAN 8,600 TERMINALS. EARLY IN 2000, TRS ANNOUNCED THE

PURCHASE FROM EDS OF MORE THAN 4,500 ATMS LOCATED IN 7-ELEVEN STORES IN 27

STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. TRS IS ALSO BRANDING ITS ENTIRE ATM NETWORK

WITH THE NAME ATM AXIS(R), AND PLANS TO OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES BEYOND DISPENSING CASH, SUCH AS MONEY TRANSFER SERVICES, STORED VALUE

CARDS AND RETAIL COUPONING.

CORPORATE SERVICES

------------------

TRS' CORPORATE SERVICES GROUP ("CSG") PROVIDES CORPORATE CARD,

CORPORATE TRAVEL, CORPORATE PURCHASING CARD AND CONSULTING SERVICES TO LEADING

CORPORATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

CSG PROVIDES CORPORATE CHARGE CARD EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO LARGE

AND MID-SIZED COMPANIES FOR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING. COMPANIES ARE

OFFERED THESE SERVICES THROUGH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) CORPORATE CARD, WHICH IS

A CHARGE CARD ISSUED TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGH A CORPORATE ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY

THEIR EMPLOYER FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.

CSG INTEGRATES THE CORPORATE CARD AND BUSINESS TRAVEL SERVICES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO MEET THE COMPETITION FOR THE

BUSINESS TRAVELER AND TO PROVIDE CLIENT COMPANIES WITH A CUSTOMIZED APPROACH TO

MANAGING THEIR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT BUDGETS. CLIENTS ARE PROVIDED AN

INFORMATION PACKAGE TO PLAN, ACCOUNT FOR AND CONTROL TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT

EXPENSES.

CSG PROVIDES A WIDE VARIETY OF TRAVEL SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS TRAVELING

FOR BUSINESS AND IS ONE OF THE LEADING BUSINESS TRAVEL PROVIDERS WORLDWIDE. FOR

BUSINESS TRAVEL ACCOUNTS, CSG PROVIDES CORPORATE TRAVEL POLICY CONSULTATION AND

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND GROUP AND INCENTIVE TRAVEL SERVICES. CSG

RECEIVES COMMISSIONS AND FEES FOR TRAVEL BOOKINGS AND ARRANGEMENTS FROM

AIRLINES, HOTELS, CAR RENTAL COMPANIES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS, FEES FOR

RESERVATIONS AND TICKETING AND MANAGEMENT AND TRANSACTION FEES FROM CERTAIN

BUSINESS TRAVEL ACCOUNTS.

CSG FACES VIGOROUS COMPETITION FROM NUMEROUS OTHER TRAVEL AGENCIES

DOMESTICALLY AS WELL AS DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES AND TRAVEL SUPPLIERS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THIS COMPETITION IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE,

CONVENIENCE AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER AND HAS INCREASED DUE TO SEVERAL

FACTORS IN RECENT YEARS, INCLUDING THE ACQUISITION OF INDEPENDENT AGENCIES BY

LARGER TRAVEL COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, MANY COMPANIES HAVE ESTABLISHED IN-HOUSE

BUSINESS TRAVEL DEPARTMENTS.

10

AIRLINES HAVE CONTINUED EFFORTS TO REDUCE THEIR DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES,

INCLUDING TRAVEL AGENCY COMMISSIONS, THROUGH TECHNIQUES SUCH AS CAPS ON

COMMISSION FEES AND DECREASES IN BASE COMMISSION RATES. IN ADDITION, AIRLINES

CONTINUE TO CONSOLIDATE THROUGH MERGERS AND BY FORMING ALLIANCES FOR MARKETING

AND SERVICE DELIVERY PURPOSES. THOSE ACTIONS HAVE CAUSED SOME INDEPENDENT

AGENCIES TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND FORCED OTHERS TO SEEK CONSOLIDATION

OPPORTUNITIES. CONSOLIDATION OF TRAVEL AGENCIES IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE AS

AGENCIES SEEK TO BETTER SERVE NATIONAL AND MULTINATIONAL BUSINESS TRAVEL CLIENTS

AND NEGOTIATE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE AIRLINES. IT IS ALSO EXPECTED THAT

TRAVEL AGENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR EXPENSE REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES SUCH

AS FOCUSING ON ELECTRONIC TICKETING. CUSTOMERS MAY INCREASINGLY SEEK ALTERNATIVE

CHANNELS TO MAKE TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS ONLINE TRAVEL RESERVATION SERVICES

OR AIRLINE SERVICES THAT REQUIRE BOOKING DIRECTLY WITH THE AIRLINES.

IN 2000, THE CSG BUSINESS GREW, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE CHALLENGING

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN MANY MARKETS AND DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PROFIT MARGINS THAT

CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. THE ONGOING TREND OF AIRLINE

ALLIANCES, AIRLINE WEBSITES PERMITTING TRAVELERS TO BOOK BUSINESS DIRECTLY AND

AIRLINE COMMISSION RATE REDUCTIONS RESULTED IN DECREASED BUSINESS TRAVEL REVENUE

AND PRICE INCREASES FOR TRAVELERS, FEWER OPPORTUNITIES FOR DATA AGGREGATION FOR

CORPORATIONS AND GREATER PRESSURE ON THE CSG TRAVEL BUSINESS. CSG CONTINUES TO

MODIFY ITS BUSINESS MODEL TO ADDRESS THESE ONGOING INDUSTRY CHALLENGES. FOR

EXAMPLE, CSG HAS ACCELERATED ITS EFFORTS TO RELY LESS ON COMMISSION REVENUES

FROM SUPPLIERS, AND HAS NOW SHIFTED MORE TOWARD FEES FOR SPECIFIC SERVICES

RENDERED BOTH FROM SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS. COMPETITORS ALSO CONTINUE TO

INCREASE THEIR FOCUS ON THE CORPORATE CARD BUSINESS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF

COMPETITION RELATING TO THE CARD ISSUING BUSINESS, SEE PAGE 7.

DURING THE YEAR, CSG LAUNCHED THE CORPORATE MEETING CARD, WHICH

PROVIDES CORPORATE MEETING PLANNERS WITH A TOOL FOR CONSOLIDATING EXPENSES AND

STREAMLINES PROCESSES WHILE MINIMIZING PAPERWORK. CSG ALSO SIGNED OR RE-SIGNED A

NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CLIENTS INCLUDING JOHNSON & JOHNSON, PFIZER AND DELL

COMPUTER CORPORATION. IN ADDITION, CSG ROLLED OUT AMERICAN EXPRESS@WORK(R)

IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS ONLINE SERVICE ALLOWS CORPORATE CLIENTS TO APPLY FOR

CORPORATE CARDS USING A "SMART FORM" SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AND REDUCES THE

ERROR RATE ON APPLICATIONS. IT ALSO ENABLES CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM

ADMINISTRATORS TO INSTANTLY APPROVE OR CANCEL CARDS, UPDATE CONTACT INFORMATION,

OR ADJUST SPENDING LIMITS.

CSG ALSO SEEKS TO IMPROVE CLIENT COMPANY MANAGEMENT OF NON-TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS EXPENSES THROUGH THE CORPORATE PURCHASING CARD. THIS

PRODUCT ASSISTS LARGE COMPANIES IN MANAGING INDIRECT SPENDING INCLUDING

TRADITIONAL PURCHASING ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES. EMPLOYEES CAN USE THE PURCHASING

CARD TO ORDER DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS, RATHER THAN USING THE

TRADITIONAL SYSTEM OF REQUISITIONS, PURCHASE ORDERS AND INVOICES AND RETAIL

STORE PURCHASING. CSG PAYS THE SUPPLIERS AND SUBMITS A SINGLE MONTHLY BILLING

STATEMENT TO THE COMPANY.

TO EXPAND ITS CAPABILITIES RELATING TO ONLINE PURCHASING, CSG IS DEVELOPING

A BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS DIGITAL MARKETPLACE. IT HAS ALSO DEVELOPED RELATIONSHIPS

WITH A NUMBER OF LEADING E-COMMERCE FIRMS TO PROVIDE A FASTER, MORE EFFICIENT

WAY FOR CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE OFFICE SUPPLIES AND RELATED PRODUCTS USING THE

CORPORATE PURCHASING CARD. FOR EXAMPLE, CSG ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC AGREEMENT WITH

ARIBA, INC. TO ACCELERATE AND STREAMLINE BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS COMMERCE THROUGH

THE JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF A SUITE OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES. WITH GETTHERE,

CSG INTRODUCED A WEB-BASED CORPORATE TRAVEL BOOKING SYSTEM, CORPORATE TRAVEL

ONLINE. CSG ALSO ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE TO FORM A NEW COMPANY, MARKETMILE

LLC, TO BUILD AND OPERATE AN INTERNET-BASED MARKETPLACE TO STREAMLINE THE

PURCHASING OF EVERYDAY BUSINESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

TRS INTERNATIONAL

-----------------

THE TRS INTERNATIONAL GROUP CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON EXPANDING ITS

PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS AND NETWORK ALLIANCES IN KEY MARKETS, EXPANDING THE

NETWORK OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND LEVERAGING

OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH IN CORPORATE CARD, CORPORATE TRAVEL AND IN OTHER AREAS

OF CORPORATE SERVICES. THIS BUSINESS WAS STRENGTHENED IN 2000 THROUGH NEW

PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, INCREASED GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES' AGREEMENTS AND

EXPANDED MERCHANT COVERAGE.

DURING THE YEAR, TRS INTERNATIONAL HAD STRONG INCREASES IN TOTAL CARDS

IN FORCE, BILLED BUSINESS AND LENDING BALANCES. TRS ALSO INCREASED ITS

INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT COVERAGE, WHICH NOW ACCOMMODATES 88 PERCENT OF

CARDMEMBERS' GENERAL PURPOSE PLASTIC SPENDING, UP FROM 86 PERCENT A YEAR AGO.

KEY SIGNINGS INCLUDED MARKS & SPENCER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CARREFOUR

SUPERMARKETS IN BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA, AND ARROW PHARMACEUTICALS AND API

PHARMACEUTICALS IN AUSTRALIA, AMONG OTHERS. HOWEVER, SUPPRESSION CONTINUES TO BE

A PROBLEM, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA.

TRS CONTINUED TO BOLSTER ITS PROPRIETARY BUSINESS DURING THE YEAR

THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF PROPRIETARY CHARGE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS IN 15 INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS, 25 AFFINITY CARD PRODUCTS AND SEVEN NEW DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS.

PRODUCTS INCLUDED A COBRAND PRODUCT WITH SINGAPORE AIRLINES IN ASIA; TWO COSTCO

COBRAND CARDS IN CANADA; A REVITALIZED PERSONAL CARD IN THE UNITED KINGDOM; AND

A COBRAND AGREEMENT WITH BRITISH AIRWAYS, WHICH LAUNCHED IN JANUARY 2001. MORE

CUSTOMERS ALSO MOVED TO PLATINUM CARD(R) AND CENTURION(SM) CARD PRODUCTS,

REFLECTING THE TREND TOWARD THE "PREMIUMIZATION" OF TRS' CUSTOMER BASE.

DURING THE YEAR, TRS INTERNATIONAL ALSO CONTINUED TO PURSUE ALLIANCES

THROUGH JOINT VENTURES OR OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS THAT

ISSUE CARDS WITH AN AMERICAN EXPRESS LOGO. SEE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES ON PAGE 2

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE ALLIANCES. TRS EXPECTS TO CONTINUE ESTABLISHING

SIMILAR TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

DEEPENING ITS EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS. TRS ALSO ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH

JCB CO., LTD. (JAPAN CREDIT BUREAU), THE LARGEST CARD ISSUER AND MERCHANT

ACQUIRER IN JAPAN. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR RECIPROCAL CARD ACCEPTANCE,

MERCHANT ACQUISITION, AND MERCHANT PROCESSING COVERING FIVE MARKETS, INCLUDING

JAPAN.

12

IN 2000, THE CORPORATE SERVICES GROUP ALSO ENHANCED ITS PRESENCE

INTERNATIONALLY. CSG EXPANDED RELATIONSHIPS WITH A NUMBER OF PROMINENT FIRMS,

INCLUDING TOTAL FINA ELF S.A., DEUTSCHE BANK AND BASF. IN ADDITION, THE

CORPORATE GOLD CARD WAS LAUNCHED IN HONG KONG, MALAYSIA, THE PHILIPPINES,

SINGAPORE AND THAILAND.

TRS INTERNATIONAL, THROUGH ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES GROUP ("FES"),

ALSO PROVIDES CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND FOREIGN PAYMENT SERVICES TO CONSUMERS IN

AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL OFFICES, DEDICATED BUREAUS, AIRPORTS AND OTHER

LOCATIONS. FES EXPANDED ITS INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS BUSINESS, WHICH OFFERS TO

SMALL BUSINESSES AND BANKING CUSTOMERS AN INTERNET-BASED SERVICE FOR MAKING

PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN SUPPLIERS IN AUSTRALIA AND THE UK. FES ALSO ENLARGED ITS

GLOBAL RETAIL BRAND PRESENCE IN EASTERN EUROPE AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND EXTENDED

ITS PARTNERSHIPS IN INDIA, THAILAND, TURKEY AND THE UNITED STATES.

THE COMPANY EXPANDED ITS INTERNET PRESENCE AND CAPABILITIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES WITH THE LAUNCH DURING 2000 OF NEW WEBSITES IN FRANCE, ITALY, THE

NETHERLANDS, SPAIN AND SWEDEN.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF COMPETITION RELATING TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL

NETWORK AND CARD ISSUING BUSINESS, SEE PAGES 2-3 AND 7.

TRAVELERS CHEQUE

----------------

THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS TRAVELERS CHEQUE GROUP, IS A LEADING ISSUER OF

TRAVELERS CHECKS. THE COMPANY ALSO ISSUES MONEY ORDER AND OFFICIAL CHECK

PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THE TRAVELFUNDS DIRECT(R) PRODUCT, WHICH

PROVIDES DIRECT DELIVERY OF FOREIGN BANK NOTES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES IN SELECTED

MARKETS.

IN 2000, MANAGEMENT OF THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE GROUP WAS MOVED FROM THE

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. TO TRS UNDER THE PRESIDENT

OF GLOBAL ESTABLISHMENT SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE GROUP IS NOW

REPORTED AS PART OF THE TRS OPERATING SEGMENT.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) TRAVELERS CHEQUE ("TRAVELERS CHEQUE" OR

"CHEQUE") IS SOLD AS A SAFE AND CONVENIENT ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENCY. THE

TRAVELERS CHEQUE IS A NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT, HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE AND IS

PAYABLE BY THE ISSUER IN THE CURRENCY OF ISSUANCE WHEN PRESENTED FOR THE

PURCHASE OF GOODS AND SERVICES OR FOR REDEMPTION. GIFT CHEQUES, A TYPE OF

TRAVELERS CHEQUE, ARE USED FOR GIFT-GIVING PURPOSES.

TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE ISSUED IN ELEVEN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING A

EURO-DENOMINATED TRAVELERS CHEQUE, BOTH DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY AND THROUGH

JOINT VENTURE COMPANIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY GENERALLY HOLDS AN EQUITY INTEREST.

AS A RESULT OF THE FINAL CONVERSION OF CERTAIN EUROPEAN CURRENCIES TO A SINGLE

EURO CURRENCY EARLY IN 2002, THE FRENCH FRANC, GERMAN MARK AND DUTCH GUILDER

AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELERS CHEQUES WILL CEASE BEING ISSUED OR SOLD BY THE END OF

2001 (BUT WILL CONTINUE TO BE HONORED, REDEEMED, AND REFUNDED IF OUTSTANDING).

13

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS THE LEADING ISSUER OF TRAVELERS CHECKS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE SOLD THROUGH A BROAD NETWORK OF OUTLETS

WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING TRAVEL OFFICES OF THE COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES AND

REPRESENTATIVES, TRAVEL AGENTS, COMMERCIAL BANKS, SAVINGS BANKS, SAVINGS AND

LOAN ASSOCIATIONS, CREDIT UNIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL, TRAVEL AND COMMERCIAL

BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY SOMETIMES COMPENSATES SELLING AGENTS FOR THEIR SALE OF

TRAVELERS CHEQUES. IN 2000, THE COMPANY EXPANDED THE SALE OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES

AND GIFT CHEQUES OVER THE INTERNET. DURING THE YEAR, TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES

INCREASED 5.3 PERCENT GLOBALLY, AND CONSUMER GIFT CHEQUE SALES INCREASED

APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT. THIS GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY NEW ADVERTISING AND

MARKETING PROGRAMS, GIFT CHEQUE PROMOTIONS, AND THE USE OF INTERNET SALES

CAPABILITIES.

THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY ARE

INVESTED PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY-RATED DEBT SECURITIES CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF

INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS.

ISSUERS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND MONEY ORDERS ARE REGULATED UNDER MOST

STATE "MONEY TRANSMITTER" LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHEQUE ISSUERS TO

OBTAIN LICENSES, TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD

OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN HIGHLY RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO

PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. MANY STATES AUDIT TRAVELERS CHEQUE AND MONEY ORDER

LICENSEES ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION, TRAVELERS CHEQUE AND MONEY ORDER ISSUERS ARE

REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS. THESE LAWS

REQUIRE ISSUERS TO PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY CHEQUE OR ORDER THAT IS

UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF YEARS.

TRAVELERS CHEQUES COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT

PRODUCTS. CONSUMERS CAN UTILIZE A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS FOR PAYMENT

SUCH AS OTHER BRANDS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, CASH, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS AND

NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE NETWORKS. THE PRINCIPAL

COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE TRAVELERS CHECK INDUSTRY ARE (I) THE

AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER OF OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT; (II) THE AMOUNT OF THE

FEE CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER; (III) THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE CHECKS THROUGHOUT

THE WORLD AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENCY; (IV) THE COMPENSATION PAID TO, AND

FREQUENCY OF SETTLEMENT BY, SELLING AGENTS; (V) THE ACCESSIBILITY OF TRAVELERS

CHECK SALES AND REFUNDS; (VI) THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL

CAMPAIGNS; AND (VII) THE ABILITY TO SERVICE SATISFACTORILY THE CHECK PURCHASER

IF THE CHECKS ARE LOST OR STOLEN.

OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

---------------------------

INTERACTIVE STRATEGY WITH A FOCUS ON PROVIDING INTERNET AND INTERACTIVE

CAPABILITIES TO MEET CUSTOMERS' NEEDS. THIS HAS BEEN AND IS EXPECTED TO BE AN

IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

14

AT YEAR-END, APPROXIMATELY 3.5 MILLION CARDMEMBERS WERE ENROLLED IN

"MANAGE YOUR CARD ACCOUNT SERVICE." THIS SERVICE ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO REVIEW

AND PAY THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS BILLS ELECTRONICALLY, VIEW THEIR MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS(R) ACCOUNTS AND CONDUCT VARIOUS OTHER FUNCTIONS QUICKLY AND SECURELY

ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES AND FUNCTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO COMMENCED A PROGRAM

WHICH UTILIZES THOUSANDS OF PARTNER WEBSITES TO INITIALLY SELL 12 DIFFERENT

INFRASTRUCTURE TO CROSS SELL AMERICAN EXPRESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT

AMERICANEXPRESS.COM. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT INTERACTIVE

STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE CUSTOMER LOYALTY, GENERATE REVENUE, LOWER

ACQUISITION COSTS AND EXTEND AWARENESS OF THE BRAND ONLINE.

OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S INTERACTIVE

INITIATIVES, TRS HAS MADE NUMEROUS MINORITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH TYPICALLY ALSO

COMMUNICATION OVER THE INTERNET; PROTEGE, A U.K.-BASED COMPANY THAT HELPS U.S.

TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ENTER THE EUROPEAN MARKET RAPIDLY; RISKMETRICS, AN ONLINE

RISK MEASUREMENT PROVIDER; AND PRIVADA, AN ONLINE PRIVACY SERVICE PROVIDER.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO DEVELOP ITS STORED-VALUE

BUSINESS WITH THE SIGNING OF LEADING RETAIL PARTNERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY

LAUNCHED WITH ZOWI CORPORATION, THE COBALTCARD, A STORED-VALUE CARD FOR

TEENAGERS AND YOUNG ADULTS DESIGNED FOR PURCHASING ONLINE AND IN STORES.

FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING VALUABLE APPLICATIONS FOR SMART CARD USERS FOR BOTH THE

ONLINE AND OFFLINE WORLD.

AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS

-----------------------------------

THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS OPERATING

SEGMENT ("AEFA"), MAKES AVAILABLE A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

TO HELP INDIVIDUALS, BUSINESSES AND INSTITUTIONS ESTABLISH AND ACHIEVE THEIR

FINANCIAL GOALS. THIS SEGMENT GENERALLY INCLUDES AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL

CORPORATION ("AEFC") AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES DESCRIBED BELOW. AEFA'S

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE, INSURANCE AND

ANNUITIES, A VARIETY OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES,

MUTUAL FUNDS AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, INVESTMENT ADVISORY SERVICES, TRUST AND

EMPLOYEE PLAN ADMINISTRATION SERVICES, PERSONAL AUTO AND HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE

AND RETAIL SECURITIES BROKERAGE SERVICES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 AMERICAN EXPRESS

FINANCIAL ADVISORS INC. ("AXP ADVISORS"), AEFA'S PRINCIPAL MARKETING SUBSIDIARY,

MAINTAINED A NATIONWIDE FINANCIAL PLANNING FIELD FORCE OF OVER 12,000 PERSONS.

AXP ADVISORS USES THE SHORTENED NAME "AMERICAN EXPRESS" IN ITS MARKETING

MATERIAL TO ESTABLISH A STRONGER BRAND IDENTITY FOR THE COMPANY IN FINANCIAL

SERVICES.

DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

-------------------------------------

AEFA HAS THREE PRIMARY FINANCIAL SERVICE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS: RETAIL,

CONSISTING OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND DIRECT ACCESS (ONLINE, TELEPHONE AND MAIL),

INSTITUTIONAL AND THIRD PARTY.

AEFA'S PRIMARY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL IS ITS SALES FORCE OF FINANCIAL

ADVISORS. THROUGH THIS CHANNEL, AEFA OFFERS FINANCIAL PLANNING AND INVESTMENT

ADVISORY SERVICES (FOR WHICH IT CHARGES A FEE) TO INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESS

OWNERS WHICH MAY ADDRESS SIX BASIC AREAS OF FINANCIAL PLANNING: FINANCIAL

POSITION, PROTECTION, INVESTMENT, INCOME TAX, RETIREMENT AND ESTATE PLANNING.

AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FROM MORE THAN

4,000 PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN MARCH 2000, AEFA IMPLEMENTED A PLATFORM STRUCTURE TO PROVIDE

ADVISORS CHOICES IN HOW THEY AFFILIATE WITH THE ORGANIZATION, WITH VARIOUS

LEVELS OF SERVICE, COMPENSATION AND BRANDING. ADVISORS ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE A

SALARIED EMPLOYEE ADVISOR PLATFORM WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE AND A LOWER

PAYOUT RATE; A BRANDED ADVISOR PLATFORM, STRUCTURED AS A FRANCHISE SYSTEM, IN

WHICH ADVISORS GET A HIGHER PAYOUT RATE AND CAN PURCHASE THE SERVICES THEY

PREFER; OR AN AFFILIATED BUT UNBRANDED BROKER-DEALER PLATFORM WITH A YET HIGHER

PAYOUT. THE UNBRANDED PLATFORM IS SECURITIES AMERICA, INC., A BROKER-DEALER

OWNED BY AEFC. IT SERVICES APPROXIMATELY 1,370 FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND IS A

DISTRIBUTOR OF MUTUAL FUNDS, ANNUITIES AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS. APPROXIMATELY 35

PERCENT OF AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS ARE AMERICAN EXPRESS EMPLOYEES; ABOUT 55

PERCENT ARE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED FRANCHISEES; AND ABOUT 10 PERCENT ARE IN

THE UNBRANDED PLATFORM. AEFA BELIEVES IT IS THE ONLY U.S. COMPANY TO OFFER THESE

THREE DIFFERENT CAREER TRACKS FOR ADVISORS, WHICH IT CONSIDERS A STRATEGIC

ADVANTAGE.

THE USE OF A DEDICATED FIELD FORCE MAY ENTAIL HIGHER INITIAL COSTS THAN

OTHER FORMS OF MARKETING, SUCH AS DIRECT-RESPONSE OR INDEPENDENT AGENCY

DISTRIBUTION. HOWEVER, AEFA BELIEVES THAT ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE BROAD-BASED

INTEGRATED SERVICES ON A RELATIONSHIP BASIS IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. AT THE

SAME TIME, AEFA RECOGNIZES THAT IT NEEDS TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO INCREASE

16

THE SIZE OF ITS DEDICATED FIELD FORCE DUE TO ITS MAIN COMPETITORS' LARGER SALES

FORCES AND MORE DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. IN ATTRACTING AND

RETAINING MEMBERS OF THE FIELD FORCE, AEFA COMPETES WITH FINANCIAL PLANNING

FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS.

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S GOAL OF PROMOTING CROSS SELLING ACROSS

ALL OF ITS UNITS, AEFA HAS INCREASED ITS SALES TO CUSTOMERS FROM OTHER AMERICAN

EXPRESS BUSINESSES. IN 2000, AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF ALL NEW CLIENTS OF AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS, AND

SUBSTANTIAL MUTUAL FUND AND INVESTMENT CERTIFICATE SALES WERE MADE TO AMERICAN

EXPRESS BANK'S FOREIGN CUSTOMERS.

AEFA RECENTLY HAS TAKEN FURTHER STEPS TO INTEGRATE ITS DIRECT RETAIL

DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL WITH THE ADVISOR CHANNEL. AEFA'S ONLINE BROKERAGE BUSINESS,

AMERICAN EXPRESS BROKERAGE, ALLOWS CLIENTS TO PURCHASE AND SELL SECURITIES

ONLINE, OBTAIN RESEARCH AND INFORMATION ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF SECURITIES, USE

ASSET ALLOCATION AND FINANCIAL PLANNING TOOLS, CONTACT AN ADVISOR, AS WELL AS

HAVE ACCESS TO MORE THAN 2,000 PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS,

AMONG OTHER SERVICES. AEFA BELIEVES IT HAS THE SIXTH LARGEST ONLINE BROKERAGE IN

THE U.S. BASED ON ASSETS AND NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS. THE COMPANY ALSO RECENTLY

PURCHASED A EUROPEAN ONLINE BROKER. SEE PAGE 24.

DURING THE YEAR, AEFA CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS,

WHICH INCLUDES SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSET MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR CORPORATE, PUBLIC

AND UNION RETIREMENT FUNDS. AEFA ALSO CONTINUED TO ACQUIRE RETAIL CLIENTS

THROUGH THE WORKPLACE WITH ITS FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND PLANNING SERVICES

PROGRAMS. FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND PLANNING SERVICES COMBINES THE RESOURCES OF

THE GROUPS FORMERLY KNOWN AS FINANCIAL EDUCATION SERVICES, INVESTING AT WORK,

AND THE EMPLOYEE EDUCATION FUNCTION WITHIN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT

SERVICES 401(K) BUSINESS. THIS NEW GROUP PROVIDES PROGRAMS IN THE WORKPLACE FOR

EMPLOYERS WHO WANT TO OFFER THEIR EMPLOYEES FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND THE

OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE AFTER-TAX FUNDS BEYOND THEIR COMPANY RETIREMENT SAVINGS

PLAN. THIS PROGRAM CURRENTLY SERVES EMPLOYEES AT APPROXIMATELY 45 COMPANIES AND

PLANS TO GROW THROUGH SALES BOTH TO NEW CLIENTS AND CURRENT AMERICAN EXPRESS

RETIREMENT SERVICES CLIENTS.

IN ADDITION TO THE RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AEFA

HAS A THIRD-PARTY CHANNEL THAT DISTRIBUTES PROPRIETARY INVESTMENT, INSURANCE AND

ANNUITY PRODUCTS THROUGH INSURANCE AGENCIES AND BROKER-DEALERS WHO MAY ALSO BE

ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS BANKS. ALTHOUGH AEFA HAS

EXPANDED ITS NETWORK OF THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS

OFFERED THROUGH THEM, THIRD-PARTY SALES EFFORTS HAVE LAGGED BEHIND EXPECTATIONS.

DURING 2000, AEFA SUSPENDED OPERATION OF ITS THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALER CHANNEL,

MADE UP OF NATIONAL AND REGIONAL BROKER-DEALERS AND INSURANCE AGENCIES, IN ORDER

TO FOCUS ON THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE CHANNEL AND THE BANK CHANNEL. AS PART OF THIS

FOCUS, AEFA FORMED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH SEVERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO

DISTRIBUTE AEFA'S PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS THROUGH THEIR RETAIL NETWORKS.

17

THE MOVE TO MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW

AEFA SERVICES ITS CLIENTS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH A MORE INTEGRATED

SERVICE, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO BUILD THE CAPABILITY TO RECOGNIZE AND SERVICE

THE CLIENT'S ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP WITH AEFA, REGARDLESS OF WHICH CHANNEL OR

CHANNELS THEY HAVE USED. THIS WILL REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CONTINUED

INVESTMENT IN BOTH TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE SERVICE ORGANIZATION. AS

AEFA HAS EXPANDED ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, IT HAS ALSO INCREASED ITS SALE OF

NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WHICH GENERALLY ARE LESS PROFITABLE THAN PROPRIETARY

SALES.

AXP ADVISORS DOES BUSINESS AS A BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISOR IN

ALL 50 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND PUERTO RICO. AXP ADVISORS IS

REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISOR REGULATED BY THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("SEC") AND IS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

SECURITIES DEALERS, INC. ("NASD"). AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS MUST OBTAIN ALL

REQUIRED STATE AND NASD LICENSES.

AEFA HAS EXPERIENCED, AND BELIEVES IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO,

INCREASED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF THE SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES INDUSTRIES AT

ALL LEVELS. AMONG OTHER POWERS, THE SEC, SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS AND STATE

SECURITIES COMMISSIONS MAY CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, WHICH MAY RESULT

IN CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS OR SUSPENSION OR

EXPULSION OF A BROKER-DEALER OR AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ITS OFFICERS OR

EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS CAN BRING COMPLAINTS AGAINST AEFA.

AEFA ALSO BELIEVES IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO STRUCTURE

ITSELF AS A FRANCHISE SYSTEM. AS SUCH, AEFA IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL TRADE

COMMISSION AND STATE FRANCHISE REQUIREMENTS.

COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON

COST, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, YIELD, CONVENIENCE, SERVICE, RELIABILITY, SAFETY,

INNOVATION, DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION. COMPETITION

IN THIS INDUSTRY IS VERY INTENSE. AEFA COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS BANKS, SECURITIES BROKERS, MUTUAL FUNDS AND INSURANCE

COMPANIES. SOME OF THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE LARGER AND MORE GLOBAL THAN AEFA, AND

THE CONTINUING TREND TOWARDS CONSOLIDATION AND GLOBALIZATION IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY MAY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THESE STRONGER COMPETITORS. MANY OF

THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALSO HAVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT INCREASINGLY

CROSS OVER THE TRADITIONAL LINES THAT PREVIOUSLY DIFFERENTIATED ONE TYPE OF

INSTITUTION FROM ANOTHER, THEREBY HEIGHTENING COMPETITION IN MANY OF AEFA'S

MARKETS. THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER, AND THE

DRAMATICALLY INCREASED USAGE BY INVESTORS OF, ONLINE INVESTMENT AND INFORMATION

SERVICES HAS ALSO AFFECTED THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF

YEARS. REFLECTING THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

HAVE CONTINUED TO SEEK TO HIRE AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS. AEFA ANTICIPATES THAT

COMPETITION IN THIS INDUSTRY WILL INCREASE AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999

("GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT"), WHICH PERMITS BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

SECURITIES FIRMS TO COMBINE AND OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF PERMISSIBLE FINANCIAL

SERVICES. SEE PAGE 34 FOR A DISCUSSION OF PRIVACY-RELATED ISSUES UNDER THIS LAW.

AEFA'S BUSINESS DOES NOT, AS A WHOLE, EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATIONS.

INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES

-----------------------

AEFA'S INSURANCE BUSINESS IS CARRIED ON PRIMARILY BY IDS LIFE INSURANCE

COMPANY ("IDS LIFE"), A STOCK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF

THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. IDS LIFE IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AEFC AND SERVES

ALL STATES EXCEPT NEW YORK. IDS LIFE BELIEVES IT IS THE FOURTEENTH LARGEST LIFE

INSURANCE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31,

2000 OF APPROXIMATELY $60 BILLION (UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES). IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY

OF IDS LIFE AND SERVES NEW YORK STATE RESIDENTS. IDS LIFE ALSO OWNS AMERICAN

ENTERPRISE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE"), WHICH ISSUES

FIXED AND VARIABLE DOLLAR ANNUITY CONTRACTS FOR SALE THROUGH INSURANCE AGENCIES

AND BROKER-DEALERS WHO MAY ALSO BE ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH

AS BANKS. AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY ("AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE")

IS AN IDS LIFE SUBSIDIARY THAT OFFERS FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITIES TO AMERICAN

EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS AND OTHERS IN NEW YORK, AS WELL AS FIXED AND VARIABLE

ANNUITIES FOR SALE THROUGH INSURANCE AGENCIES AND BROKER-DEALERS WHO MAY ALSO BE

ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS BANKS, IN NEW YORK. IDS LIFE

OWNS AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE"), WHICH

OFFERS FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACTS TO AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) CARDMEMBERS

AND OTHERS WHO RESIDE IN STATES OTHER THAN NEW YORK.

IDS LIFE'S PRODUCTS INCLUDE WHOLE LIFE, UNIVERSAL LIFE (FIXED AND

VARIABLE), SINGLE PREMIUM LIFE AND TERM PRODUCTS (INCLUDING WAIVER OF PREMIUM

IDS LIFE ALSO OFFERS A VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCT, THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS(R) VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE III, IN WHICH THE PURCHASER MAY CHOOSE AMONG

INVESTMENT OPTIONS WHICH INCLUDE PORTFOLIOS OF COMMON STOCKS, BONDS, MANAGED

ASSETS AND/OR SHORT-TERM SECURITIES, AND IDS LIFE'S "GENERAL ACCOUNT".

IDS LIFE IS ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST ISSUERS OF SINGLE PREMIUM AND

FLEXIBLE PREMIUM DEFERRED ANNUITIES ON BOTH A FIXED AND VARIABLE DOLLAR BASIS.

IMMEDIATE ANNUITIES ARE OFFERED AS WELL. IDS LIFE'S FIXED DEFERRED ANNUITIES

GUARANTEE A RELATIVELY LOW ANNUAL INTEREST RATE DURING THE ACCUMULATION PERIOD

(THE TIME BEFORE ANNUITY PAYMENTS BEGIN). HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION OF

PAYING A HIGHER RATE SET AT ITS DISCRETION. IN ADDITION, PERSONS OWNING ONE TYPE

OF ANNUITY MAY HAVE THEIR INTEREST CALCULATED BASED ON ANY UPWARD MOVEMENT IN A

BROAD-BASED STOCK MARKET INDEX. IDS LIFE ALSO OFFERS A VARIABLE ANNUITY, THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT ADVISOR VARIABLE ANNUITY(R), IN WHICH THE PURCHASER

OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, IDS LIFE'S VARIABLE ANNUITY SALES HAVE HAD AN

INCREASING IMPACT ON TOTAL ANNUITY SALES. IN 2000, SALES OF ANNUITY PRODUCTS

ROSE 51 PERCENT, WITH VARIABLE ANNUITY SALES PARTICULARLY STRONG AS A RESULT OF

NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS.

19

IDS LIFE, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE AND AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE ARE

SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION BY THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

(INSURANCE DIVISION), THE INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, AND THE ARIZONA

DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, RESPECTIVELY. AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE AND IDS LIFE

INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK ARE REGULATED BY THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF

INSURANCE. THE LAWS OF THE OTHER STATES IN WHICH THESE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS

ALSO REGULATE SUCH MATTERS AS THE LICENSING OF SALES PERSONNEL AND, IN SOME

CASES, THE MARKETING AND CONTENTS OF INSURANCE POLICIES AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS.

THE PURPOSE OF SUCH REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IS PRIMARILY TO PROTECT THE

INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS. REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF MARKET CONDUCT PRACTICES OF

INSURANCE COMPANIES, INCLUDING SALES, MARKETING AND REPLACEMENTS OF FIXED AND

VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES AND "BONUS" ANNUITIES, HAS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS AND IS AFFECTING THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPANIES

APPROACH VARIOUS OPERATIONAL ISSUES, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE. THE NUMBER OF PRIVATE

LAWSUITS ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH INSURANCE AND ANNUITY

MARKET CONDUCT HAS INCREASED (SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ON PAGE 42). VIRTUALLY ALL

STATES MANDATE PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ASSESS

INSURANCE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO FUND CLAIMS OF POLICYHOLDERS OF INSOLVENT

INSURANCE COMPANIES. ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL, THERE IS PERIODIC INTEREST IN

ENACTING NEW REGULATIONS RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY,

INCLUDING TAXATION OF VARIABLE ANNUITIES AND LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, ACCOUNTING

PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF GENDER,

WITH RESPECT TO TERMS, CONDITIONS, RATES OR BENEFITS OF AN INSURANCE CONTRACT.

NEW FEDERAL REGULATION IN ANY OF THESE AREAS COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT UPON AEFC'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.

AS A DISTRIBUTOR OF VARIABLE ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS, IDS

LIFE IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER AND IS A MEMBER OF THE NASD. AS INVESTMENT

MANAGER OF VARIOUS INVESTMENT COMPANIES, IDS LIFE IS REGISTERED AS AN INVESTMENT

ADVISOR UNDER APPLICABLE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. THIS INSURANCE IS ALSO UNDERWRITTEN BY AMEX ASSURANCE

COMPANY, A SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, AND REINSURED BY IDS PROPERTY

CASUALTY. IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY IS REGULATED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE

FOR WISCONSIN. AMEX ASSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH ALSO PROVIDES CERTAIN AMERICAN

EXPRESS CARD RELATED INSURANCE PRODUCTS, IS REGULATED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF

INSURANCE FOR ILLINOIS.

THE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND IDS

LIFE'S COMPETITORS CONSIST OF BOTH STOCK AND MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANIES.

COMPETITIVE FACTORS APPLICABLE TO THE INSURANCE BUSINESS INCLUDE THE INTEREST

RATES CREDITED TO PRODUCTS, THE CHARGES DEDUCTED FROM THE CASH VALUES OF SUCH

PRODUCTS, THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED

AMERICAN EXPRESS CERTIFICATE COMPANY ("AECC") (FORMERLY IDS CERTIFICATE

COMPANY), A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AEFC, ISSUES FACE-AMOUNT INVESTMENT

CERTIFICATES. AECC IS REGISTERED AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT

COMPANY ACT OF 1940. AECC CURRENTLY ISSUES TEN TYPES OF FACE-AMOUNT

CERTIFICATES. OWNERS OF AECC CERTIFICATES ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE, AT MATURITY,

20

PLUS INTEREST AT RATES DECLARED FROM TIME TO TIME BY AECC. IN ADDITION, PERSONS

OWNING THREE TYPES OF CERTIFICATES MAY HAVE THEIR INTEREST CALCULATED IN WHOLE

OR IN PART BASED ON ANY UPWARD MOVEMENT IN A BROAD-BASED STOCK MARKET INDEX UP

TO A VARIABLE MAXIMUM RETURN. THE CERTIFICATES ISSUED BY AECC ARE NOT INSURED BY

ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY. AEFC ACTS AS INVESTMENT MANAGER FOR AECC. AECC'S

CERTIFICATES ARE SOLD BY AEFA'S FIELD FORCE, AS WELL AS MARKETED BY AMERICAN

EXPRESS BANK LTD. TO ITS FOREIGN CUSTOMERS.

AECC IS THE LARGEST ISSUER OF FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES IN THE UNITED

STATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, IT HAD APPROXIMATELY $4.0 BILLION IN ASSETS.

AECC'S CERTIFICATES COMPETE WITH MANY OTHER INVESTMENTS OFFERED BY BANKS,

SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS, CREDIT UNIONS, MUTUAL FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES

AND SIMILAR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH MAY BE VIEWED BY POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS

AS OFFERING A COMPARABLE OR SUPERIOR COMBINATION OF SAFETY AND RETURN ON

INVESTMENT.

MUTUAL FUNDS

------------

AEFA OFFERS A VARIETY OF MUTUAL FUNDS, FOR WHICH AXP ADVISORS ACTS AS

PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER (DISTRIBUTOR OF SHARES). AEFC ACTS AS INVESTMENT MANAGER

AND PERFORMS VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) FUNDS

INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, MONEY MARKET, TAX-EXEMPT, BOND AND STOCK FUNDS. THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS FUNDS, WITH COMBINED NET ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 OF $92.7

BILLION, WAS THE 20TH LARGEST MUTUAL FUND FAMILY IN THE UNITED STATES AND,

EXCLUDING MONEY MARKET FUNDS, WAS THE 10TH LARGEST. RESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS FUNDS WERE MIXED IN 2000, PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THE DOWNTURN IN ALL

MAJOR U.S. STOCK MARKETS AS WELL AS IN MANY GLOBAL MARKETS. OVERALL MUTUAL FUND

SALES, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY FUNDS, INCREASED 29 PERCENT IN

2000.

DURING THE YEAR, AEFA LAUNCHED FOUR NEW PROPRIETARY FUNDS IN THE UNITED

STATES: AXP(R) INNOVATIONS FUND, AXP(R) EUROPEAN EQUITY FUND, AXP(R) FOCUS 20

AND AXP(R) GROWTH DIMENSIONS. IMPROVING THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS FUNDS IS A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE COMPANY.

FOR MOST FUNDS, SHARES ARE SOLD IN FOUR CLASSES. CLASS A SHARES ARE

SOLD AT NET ASSET VALUE PLUS ANY APPLICABLE SALES CHARGE. THE MAXIMUM SALES

CHARGE IS 5.75% FOR EQUITY FUNDS AND 4.75% FOR INCOME FUNDS, WITH REDUCED SALES

CHARGES FOR LARGER PURCHASES. THE SALES CHARGE MAY BE WAIVED FOR CERTAIN

PURCHASES, INCLUDING THOSE MADE THROUGH AN INVESTMENT PRODUCT SPONSORED BY AXP

ADVISORS OR ANOTHER AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY. CLASS B SHARES ARE SOLD

WITH A REAR LOAD. THE MAXIMUM SALES CHARGE IS FIVE PERCENT, DECLINING TO NO

CHARGE FOR SHARES HELD OVER SIX YEARS. CLASS C SHARES DO NOT HAVE A FRONT-END

SALES CHARGE. A ONE PERCENT CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE MAY APPLY FOR

SHARES SOLD LESS THAN ONE YEAR AFTER PURCHASE. CLASS Y SHARES ARE SOLD TO

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS WITH NO LOAD. THERE ARE FIVE INDEX FUNDS, WHICH ARE SOLD

IN TWO NO-LOAD CLASSES. CLASS D SHARES ARE SOLD WITH A 0.25% FEE FOR

DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, BUT WITHOUT A SALES CHARGE, THROUGH AN INVESTMENT PRODUCT

SPONSORED BY AEFA OR ANOTHER AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. CLASS E SHARES

ACCOUNTS AND QUALIFYING INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTS.

21

FIFTEEN OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FUNDS ARE STRUCTURED AS FEEDER FUNDS

INVESTING IN THE PREFERRED MASTER TRUST GROUP, A GROUP OF 15 MASTER FUNDS,

ADVISED BY AEFC. THIS FEEDER STRUCTURE PROVIDES FOR POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF

ADDITIONAL CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION.

IN ADDITION TO FULL-COMMISSION AND DISCOUNT BROKERAGE FIRMS,

COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS BANKS AND INSURANCE

COMPANIES. RECENT GROWTH TRENDS IN THE MARKET, INCLUDING THE INCREASING SALES OF

MUTUAL FUNDS TO RETAIL INVESTORS, HAVE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS IN THE

INDUSTRY. SOME COMPETITORS ARE LARGER, MORE DIVERSIFIED AND OFFER A GREATER

NUMBER OF PRODUCTS, AND MAY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THEIR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND

RETAIN CUSTOMERS ON THE BASIS OF ONE-STOP SHOPPING. THE COMPETITIVE FACTORS

AFFECTING THE SALE OF MUTUAL FUNDS INCLUDE SALES CHARGES ("LOADS") PAID,

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, SERVICES RECEIVED, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, THE VARIETY

OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED, THE CONVENIENCE TO THE INVESTOR AND GENERAL

MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FUNDS COMPETE WITH OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

FUNDS THAT HAVE NO SALES CHARGE (I.E., "NO LOAD" FUNDS) AND FUNDS DISTRIBUTED

THROUGH INDEPENDENT BROKERAGE FIRMS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK

---------------------

THE COMPANY'S WHOLLY-OWNED INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK

LTD. (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, WHERE APPROPRIATE, "AEB"), OFFERS PRODUCTS

THAT MEET THE FINANCIAL SERVICE NEEDS OF FOUR CLIENT GROUPS: RETAIL CUSTOMERS,

WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CORPORATIONS. AEB DOES NOT

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES EXCEPT AS AN INCIDENT TO

ITS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION

RELATING TO AEB GENERALLY DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND

NON-UNITED STATES BASED ACTIVITIES.

AEB'S FOUR PRIMARY BUSINESS LINES ARE PERSONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES,

PRIVATE BANKING, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (FORMERLY CORRESPONDENT BANKING) AND

CORPORATE BANKING. PERSONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES ("PFS") PROVIDES CONSUMER

CLIENTS TO INDIVIDUALS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS CHANGE ALIGNS AEB'S

BUSINESSES MORE CLOSELY WITH THE REST OF THE COMPANY AND POSITIONS IT TO PLAY A

MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES ON A GLOBAL BASIS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2000, PRIVATE BANKING CLIENT HOLDINGS ROSE 12 PERCENT TO A TOTAL OF

OVER $10 BILLION AND CLIENT VOLUMES IN PFS INCREASED 19 PERCENT. DUE IN PART TO

THIS CHANGE IN EMPHASIS, AEB REDUCED ITS CORPORATE BANKING LOANS BY $140 MILLION

IN 2000 AND INCREASED ITS CONSUMER AND PRIVATE BANKING LOANS BY $410 MILLION

($340 MILLION EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ASSET SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS IN THE

MILLION. AT YEAR-END, LOANS OUTSTANDING WORLDWIDE WERE APPROXIMATELY $5.3

BILLION, UP FROM $5.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 1999.

MANAGED BY AEFC) AND A GLOBAL HIGH-YIELD EURO DEBT FUND. ADDITIONALLY, AEB

LAUNCHED A THIRD PORTFOLIO IN ITS OFFSHORE HEDGE FUND FAMILY, THE GLOBAL

LONG-SHORT FUND-OF-FUNDS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED TO WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS

THROUGH THE PRIVATE BANK.

AEB ALSO CONTINUED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE COMPANY TO

CROSS-SELL PRODUCTS AND BUILD DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS. SIXTY PERCENT

OF PFS CUSTOMERS IN ESTABLISHED PFS MARKETS ARE ALSO AMERICAN EXPRESS

CARDMEMBERS. AEB ALSO MARKETED ITS PRIVATE BANKING SERVICES TO A HIGHLY TARGETED

GROUP OF CARDMEMBERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AEB OFFERS CREDIT PRODUCTS SUCH

AS INSTALLMENT LOANS AND REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT TO BOTH CARDMEMBERS AND

NON-CARDMEMBERS IN FRANCE, GERMANY, GREECE, HONG KONG, INDIA, SINGAPORE, TAIWAN

AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. AEB ALSO MARKETS A WIDE RANGE OF INVESTMENT AND SAVINGS

PRODUCTS TO TRS CARDMEMBERS AND SELECT NON-CARDMEMBERS IN FRANCE, GERMANY,

GREECE, HONG KONG, INDONESIA, SINGAPORE, TAIWAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN

FLUCTUATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT INFORMATION ABOUT AEB'S IMPAIRED LOANS.

AEB DEFINES AN IMPAIRED LOAN AS ANY LOAN (OTHER THAN CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS) ON

WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE THE CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT OF

PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST HAS BECOME 90 DAYS PAST DUE OR IF, IN MANAGEMENT'S

OPINION, THE BORROWER IS UNLIKELY TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS (I.E.,

NON-PERFORMING LOANS).

(A)  THE INCREASE IN 1998 WAS MAINLY DUE TO FIRST QUARTER CREDIT LOSS PROVISION

RELATED TO BUSINESS IN THE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION, PARTICULARLY INDONESIA.

(B)  THE INCREASE IN 1998 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO WRITE-OFFS IN THE ASIA/PACIFIC

REGION, PRIMARILY INDONESIA.

(C)  THE INCREASE IN 1998 WAS DUE TO WRITE-OFFS OF INDONESIAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE

INTEREST INCOME IS RECOGNIZED ON THE ACCRUAL BASIS. LOANS OTHER THAN

CERTAIN CONSUMER LOANS ARE PLACED ON NON-PERFORMING STATUS WHEN PAYMENTS OF

PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST ARE 90 DAYS PAST DUE OR IF, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, THE

BORROWER IS UNLIKELY TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WHEN LOANS ARE PLACED

ON NON-PERFORMING STATUS, ALL PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST IS REVERSED

AGAINST CURRENT INTEREST INCOME. CASH RECEIPTS OF INTEREST ON NON-PERFORMING

LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED EITHER AS INTEREST INCOME OR AS A REDUCTION OF PRINCIPAL,

BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT AS TO THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF PRINCIPAL.

GENERALLY, A NON-PERFORMING LOAN MAY BE RETURNED TO PERFORMING STATUS WHEN ALL

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS DUE ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF REPAYMENT WITHIN A REASONABLE

PERIOD AND THE BORROWER SHOWS SUSTAINED REPAYMENT PERFORMANCE, IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN OR WHEN THE LOAN HAS BECOME WELL SECURED

AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, INTEREST-EARNING ADVANCES UNDER LINES OF

CREDIT AND OTHER SIMILAR CONSUMER LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE RESERVE FOR

CREDIT LOSSES UPON REACHING SPECIFIED CONTRACTUAL DELINQUENCY STAGES, OR EARLIER

IN THE EVENT OF THE BORROWER'S PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY OR IF THE LOAN IS OTHERWISE

DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. INTEREST INCOME ON THESE LOANS GENERALLY ACCRUES UNTIL THE

LOAN IS WRITTEN OFF.

AEB SEPARATELY MAINTAINS AND PROVIDES FOR RESERVES RELATING TO CREDIT

LOSSES FOR LOANS, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER CREDIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE RESERVE

IS ESTABLISHED BY CHARGING A PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AGAINST INCOME. THE

AMOUNT CHARGED TO INCOME IS BASED UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL

CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN RELATION TO OUTSTANDING CREDITS, A CONTINUOUS

ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF EACH CREDIT, AND MANAGEMENT EVALUATION OF

EXPOSURES IN EACH APPLICABLE COUNTRY AS RELATED TO CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY OF

THE RESERVE IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE, AS SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED.

AMOUNTS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE ARE CHARGED AGAINST THE RESERVE AND SUBSEQUENT

RECOVERIES, IF ANY, ARE CREDITED TO THE RESERVE.

THE RESERVE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO LOANS IS REPORTED AS A

REDUCTION OF LOANS. THE RESERVE RELATED TO DERIVATIVES IS REPORTED AS A

REDUCTION OF TRADING ASSETS AND THE RESERVE RELATED TO OTHER CREDIT-RELATED

COMMITMENTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES.

RISKS

-----

THE GLOBAL NATURE OF AEB'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IS SUCH THAT

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT TO PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS ARE NOT

UNUSUAL. AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, AEB HAD SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN ON-

AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY REPRESENTED BY

DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES, LOANS, FORWARD CONTRACTS, CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS

OF LETTERS OF CREDIT (STANDBY AND COMMERCIAL) AND GUARANTEES. THE COUNTERPARTIES

TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WERE PRIMARILY UNRELATED TO AEB, AND PRINCIPALLY

CONSISTED OF BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND VARIOUS COMMERCIAL AND

INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES OPERATING GEOGRAPHICALLY WITHIN THE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION,

EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA, LATIN AMERICA AND THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT. AEB

CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS ITS CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS AND ACTIVELY MANAGES TO REDUCE

THE ASSOCIATED RISK.

31

AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, AEB HAD EXPOSURES THROUGHOUT THE ASIA/PACIFIC

REGION, INCLUDING IN HONG KONG, SINGAPORE, TAIWAN, INDONESIA AND KOREA, AMONG

OTHER COUNTRIES. AEB HAD APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION OUTSTANDING IN LOANS IN THE

ENTIRE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION AT YEAR-END. IN ADDITION TO THESE LOANS, THERE ARE

OTHER BANKING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS FORWARD CONTRACTS, VARIOUS CONTINGENCIES AND

MARKET PLACEMENTS, WHICH ADDED ANOTHER APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION TO THE CREDIT

EXPOSURES IN THE REGION AT YEAR-END. IN AN ONGOING EFFORT TO MITIGATE THE

EFFECTS OF THESE RISKS, AS WELL AS AEB'S DECISION TO SHIFT ITS BUSINESS FOCUS

FROM CORPORATIONS TO INDIVIDUALS, AEB HAS REDUCED ITS WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE

IN 2000, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO ITS ASIA/PACIFIC COMMERCIAL LOAN

PORTFOLIO. AEB CONTINUES TO CAREFULLY MONITOR ITS CREDIT EXPOSURES.

AEB'S EARNINGS ARE SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, AS IT

IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO MATCH PRECISELY THE MATURITIES OF INTEREST-RELATED

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, STRICT LIMITS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR BOTH

COUNTRY AND TOTAL BANK MISMATCHING. ON OCCASION, AEB MAY DECIDE TO MISMATCH IN

ANTICIPATION OF A CHANGE IN FUTURE INTEREST RATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE

GUIDELINES. TERM LOANS EXTENDED BY AEB INCLUDE BOTH FLOATING INTEREST RATE AND

FIXED INTEREST RATE LOANS.

FOR A DISCUSSION RELATING TO AEB'S USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, SEE PAGES 38 THROUGH 40 UNDER THE CAPTION "RISK MANAGEMENT," AND

NOTE 8 ON PAGES 53 THROUGH 57, OF THE COMPANY'S 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS OF SUCH REPORT ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE.

COMPETITION

-----------

THE BANKING SERVICES OF AEB ARE SUBJECT TO VIGOROUS COMPETITION IN ALL

MARKETS IN WHICH AEB OPERATES. COMPETITORS INCLUDE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL BANKS

WHOSE ASSETS OFTEN EXCEED THOSE OF AEB, OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING

CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY) AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, GOVERNMENTAL

AGENCIES. IN SOME COUNTRIES, AEB MAY BE ONE OF THE MORE SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS OFFERING BANKING SERVICES; IN NO COUNTRY, HOWEVER, IS AEB DOMINANT.

REGULATION

----------

AEB IS A WHOLLY-OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN EXPRESS BANKING

CORP. ("AEBC"). AEBC IS A NEW YORK INVESTMENT COMPANY ORGANIZED UNDER ARTICLE

XII OF THE NEW YORK BANKING LAW AND IS A WHOLLY-OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE

COMPANY. AEBC, AEB AND AEB'S GLOBAL NETWORK OF OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE

SUBJECT TO THE CONSOLIDATED SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION OF THE NEW YORK STATE

BANKING DEPARTMENT ("NYSBD") PURSUANT TO THE NEW YORK BANKING LAW. AEBC DOES NOT

DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN BANKING ACTIVITIES.

AEB'S BRANCHES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE LICENSED

AND REGULATED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS AND ARE SUBJECT TO

THE SAME LOCAL REQUIREMENTS AS OTHER COMPETITORS. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES,

AEB'S NEW YORK AGENCY IS SUPERVISED AND REGULARLY EXAMINED BY THE NYSBD. IN

ADDITION, THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF BANKING AND FINANCE SUPERVISES AND EXAMINES

AEB'S MIAMI AGENCY, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

32

SYSTEM (THE "FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD") REGULATES, SUPERVISES AND EXAMINES AEBI

AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISES AND EXAMINES

AEB'S SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES FACILITY OFFICES. AEB GLOBAL ASSET

MANAGEMENT INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AEB THAT PROVIDES INVESTMENT

ADVISORY SERVICES TO PRIVATE BANKING CLIENTS, IS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS AN

INVESTMENT ADVISOR. AEB MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH VARIOUS NON-U.S. SECURITIES

REGULATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE PROMULGATED BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY IN

THE U.K.

SINCE AEB DOES NOT DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, EXCEPT AS AN

INCIDENT TO ITS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY'S AFFILIATION

WITH AEB NEITHER CAUSES THE COMPANY TO BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BANK

HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED, NOR REQUIRES IT TO REGISTER AS A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD'S REGULATION Y. AEB IS NOT A

MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, IS NOT SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION BY THE FDIC,

AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE COMPETITIVE

EQUALITY BANKING ACT OF 1987 OTHER THAN ANTI-TIE-IN RULES WITH RESPECT TO

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES. AEB

IS NOT A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT.

AEB IS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD'S RISK-BASED

CAPITAL GUIDELINES AND COMPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE CONSTRAINT APPLICABLE TO

STATE-CHARTERED BANKS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. PURSUANT

TO THE FDIC IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AMONG OTHER

FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES, ADOPTED REGULATIONS DEFINING LEVELS OF CAPITAL

ADEQUACY. UNDER THESE REGULATIONS, A BANK IS DEEMED TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED IF IT

MAINTAINS A TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6.0 PERCENT, A TOTAL

RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10.0 PERCENT, AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT

LEAST 5.0 PERCENT. BASED ON AEB'S TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS,

WHICH ARE SET FORTH ON PAGE 27, AEB IS CONSIDERED TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2000.

IN RECENT YEARS U.S. AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, TOGETHER WITH

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE RAISED INCREASING CONCERNS OVER THE ABILITY OF

CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CORRUPT PERSONS TO USE GLOBAL FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES TO FACILITATE MONEY LAUNDERING. THESE AUTHORITIES ARE MORE

CLOSELY SCRUTINIZING OR REGULATING THE PRACTICES AND CONTROLS OF FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES SUBJECT TO THEIR JURISDICTION IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE WORLDWIDE

MONEY LAUNDERING. AEB HAS INCREASED ITS COMPLIANCE EFFORTS TO COMBAT MONEY

LAUNDERING AND MAY INCREASE THESE EFFORTS FURTHER TO ADDRESS EVOLVING

SUPERVISORY STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

-------------------

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES - TRUST, SECURITY,

INTEGRITY, QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE - ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. IN

2000, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON THE BRAND BY EDUCATING EMPLOYEES ABOUT

ITS ATTRIBUTES AND BY FURTHER INCORPORATING THESE ATTRIBUTES INTO ITS PROGRAMS,

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUED A MORE AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY

IN SEEKING PATENTS FOR ITS BUSINESSES.

33

THE COMPANY USES INFORMATION ABOUT ITS CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES AND TO PROVIDE PERSONAL SERVICE. REGULATORY ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS

OF PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION IS GROWING WORLDWIDE AND IS GENERALLY BEING

DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY AND CONCOMITANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE

POTENTIALLY RAPID AND WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION AND USE OF INFORMATION. THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION LEGISLATION ENACTED IN 1999 (GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY

ACT) PROVIDES FOR DISCLOSURE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION'S PRIVACY POLICIES AND

PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO "OPT OUT" OF THE INSTITUTION'S

DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH

LIMITED EXCEPTIONS). FEDERAL REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE NEW LEGISLATION WILL

BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2001. THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS

THAT AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS, AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE

PROPOSED SUCH LEGISLATION. IN ADDITION, THE EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE

BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 1998 AND INVOLVES POTENTIAL SANCTIONS FOR VIOLATIONS

WHICH INCLUDE THE POSSIBLE DISRUPTION IN THE FLOW OF PERSONAL DATA FROM EUROPE

AND IN THE USE OF SUCH DATA. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO VIGILANTLY

SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND ITS

INTERNAL DATA PROTECTION POLICIES, WHILE SEEKING TO PROPERLY COLLECT AND USE

DATA TO ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.

THE BALCOR COMPANY HOLDINGS, INC., AN INDIRECT, WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY

OF THE COMPANY, AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, FORMERLY OPERATED AS A DIVERSIFIED REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT COMPANY, DISCONTINUED NEW COMMERCIAL REAL

ESTATE ACTIVITIES IN 1990 AND BEGAN TO LIQUIDATE ITS PORTFOLIO OF REAL ESTATE

LOANS AND PROPERTIES. THE LIQUIDATION WAS COMPLETED IN 1998. BALCOR AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES ALSO SERVED AS GENERAL PARTNERS IN NUMEROUS PUBLIC LIMITED

PARTNERSHIPS, THE LAST OF WHICH WERE DISSOLVED IN DECEMBER 2000.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

------------------

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUES FROM THE USE

OF THE CARD, TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND TRAVEL SERVICES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES AND CONTINUES TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES,

INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD

ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS' SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH

COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN OTHER

THAN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCY AND FOR THE REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS

CHEQUE SALES, CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S REVENUES. SUBSTANTIAL AND

SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS' CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY

TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF THE CARD ON ACCOUNT OF SPENDING OUTSIDE

THE LOCAL COUNTRY. THE MAJOR PORTION OF AEB'S BANKING REVENUES IS FROM BUSINESS

CONDUCTED IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SOME OF THE RISKS ATTENDANT TO

THOSE OPERATIONS INCLUDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS IN EACH SUCH COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE

POSSIBILITY THAT, BECAUSE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR MAY BE

REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESSER THAN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT

WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECORDED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE

PURCHASE BY CARDMEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE

CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE

34

BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A TRAVELERS CHEQUE DENOMINATED IN A SECOND

CURRENCY; FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS HELD BY AEB AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ITS

CLIENT-RELATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING OPERATIONS; AND, IN MOST INSTANCES,

INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS, UNLESS PROPERLY MONITORED AND

MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S POLICY IN THIS AREA IS GENERALLY TO MONITOR CLOSELY ALL

FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS AND TO MINIMIZE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES,

FOR EXAMPLE, BY OFFSETTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY

LIABILITIES, AS IN THE CASE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE

FINANCED IN THE SAME CURRENCY. AN ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUE USED TO MANAGE EXPOSURES

IS THE SPOT AND FORWARD PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AS A HEDGE OF NET

EXPOSURES IN THOSE CURRENCIES AS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF THE CARDMEMBER AND

TRAVELERS CHEQUE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, CARDMEMBERS MAY BE

CHARGED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS FOR THEIR SPENDING OUTSIDE THEIR LOCAL COUNTRY.

THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE HEDGED BY FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS OR BY IDENTIFIABLE TRANSACTIONS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

IMPORTANT FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

------------------------------------------------------

VARIOUS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY ALSO BE MADE IN THE COMPANY'S

OTHER REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC, IN ITS PRESS RELEASES AND IN OTHER DOCUMENTS.

IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY THROUGH ITS MANAGEMENT MAY MAKE ORAL

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED BELOW, WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM SUCH STATEMENTS. THE WORDS "BELIEVE,"

"EXPECT," "ANTICIPATE," "OPTIMISTIC," "INTEND," "AIM," "WILL," "SHOULD" AND

SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. READERS

ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,

WHICH SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THEY ARE MADE. THE COMPANY UNDERTAKES

NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE PUBLICLY OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE

COMPANY'S FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE

FOLLOWING.

THE COMPANY'S INABILITY TO.

MAINTAINING HIGH SERVICE LEVELS;

SYSTEMS;

O   EFFECTIVELY TRANSITION TO THE EURO CURRENCY IN 2002, INCLUDING

MANAGING COSTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND PERSONNEL, ALLOCATING

RESOURCES BETWEEN THE CONVERSION AND DEVELOPMENT AND LAUNCH OF

NEW PRODUCTS, AND CREATING NEW EURO-BASED REVENUE SOURCES

WITHIN EUROPE;

O   RECOGNIZE EVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS BY COMPETITORS

OR OTHERS WHICH COULD HASTEN BUSINESS MODEL OBSOLESCENCE OR,

BECAUSE OF PATENT RIGHTS HELD BY SUCH COMPETITORS OR OTHERS,

LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE COMPANY'S USE OF DESIRED BUSINESS

TECHNOLOGY OR PROCESSES;

O   DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT SUCCESSFULLY ENTERPRISE-WIDE INTERACTIVE

STRATEGIES;

O   INTEGRATE ITS INTERNET APPLICATIONS AND MAKE THE ONLINE

EXPERIENCE MORE DESIRABLE, RELIABLE AND USER FRIENDLY FOR

CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS;

TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON ITS NETWORK BOTH IN THE UNITED

STATES AND IN ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS;

O   SUCCESSFULLY ACQUIRE AND CONVERT CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS FROM

OTHER CARD ISSUERS;

PROPRIETARY AND THIRD PARTY-ISSUED CARD BUSINESSES;

O   RETAIN CARDMEMBERS IN CONSUMER LENDING PRODUCTS AFTER LOW

INTRODUCTORY RATE PERIODS HAVE EXPIRED; AND

AND TO DEVELOP DEEPER MERCHANT RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH CREATION

OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

AEFA'S INABILITY TO.

O   CURTAIL POTENTIAL DETERIORATION IN ITS HIGH-YIELD INVESTMENTS,

WHICH COULD RESULT IN FURTHER LOSSES IN AEFA'S INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO;

O   IMPROVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE IN AEFA'S MUTUAL FUND BUSINESS,

INCLUDING ATTRACTING AND RETAINING HIGH QUALITY PERSONNEL;

O   BALANCE EFFECTIVELY THE ECONOMICS IN SELLING A GROWING VOLUME

OF NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS TO CLIENTS;

O   RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, A SHORT-TERM

FINANCIAL MARKET CRASH OR A LONG-TERM FINANCIAL MARKET DECLINE

OR STAGNATION, WHICH COULD AFFECT THE SALE OF INVESTMENT

PRODUCTS AT AEFA AND THE MARKET VALUE OF AEFA'S MANAGED

ASSETS, RESULTING IN LOWER MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION FEES.

37

IN GENERAL.

O   CREDIT TRENDS AND THE RATE OF BANKRUPTCIES, WHICH CAN AFFECT

SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND

CORPORATE CUSTOMERS, RISKS ARISING FROM MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES,

AND RETURNS ON THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS;

O   FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES;

O   THE EFFECT OF CHANGING INTEREST RATES, WHICH COULD AFFECT

AEFA'S SPREADS BETWEEN REVENUES FROM OWNED INVESTMENTS AND

BENEFITS CREDITED TO CLIENTS' ACCOUNTS, TRS' BORROWING COSTS

AND TRS' AND AEB'S RETURN ON LENDING PRODUCTS;

O   CHANGES IN LAWS OR GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, SUCH AS TAX LAWS
