BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE

COMPANY, WE, US OR OUR), IS A GLOBAL SERVICES COMPANY THAT PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO PRODUCTS, INSIGHTS AND EXPERIENCES THAT ENRICH LIVES AND BUILD BUSINESS SUCCESS. OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES ARE CHARGE AND CREDIT PAYMENT CARD PRODUCTS AND TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES OFFERED TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD.

WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1850 AS A JOINT STOCK ASSOCIATION. WE WERE INCORPORATED IN 1965 AS A NEW YORK CORPORATION. AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL

RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. (TRS), ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED (THE BHC ACT), SUBJECT TO THE SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE).

OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK IN LOWER MANHATTAN. WE

ALSO HAVE OFFICES IN OTHER LOCATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

WE ARE PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED IN

BUSINESSES COMPRISING FOUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: U.S. CARD SERVICES, INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES, GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES AND GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES, ALL OF WHICH WE DESCRIBE BELOW. CORPORATE FUNCTIONS AND

AUXILIARY BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP, PUBLISHING BUSINESS AND OTHER COMPANY OPERATIONS, ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE & OTHER.

WE COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WITH CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS, ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS, AS WELL AS EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS. AS THE PAYMENTS

INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE ARE FACING INCREASING COMPETITION FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS, SUCH AS ONLINE NETWORKS, TELECOM PROVIDERS AND SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE PROVIDERS, THAT LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CUSTOMERS EXISTING CARD

ACCOUNTS AND BANK RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT OR OTHER FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS. WE ARE TRANSFORMING OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES AND CREATING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR THE DIGITAL MARKETPLACE AS WE INCREASE OUR SHARE OF ONLINE SPEND, ENHANCE OUR

CUSTOMERS DIGITAL EXPERIENCES AND DEVELOP PLATFORMS FOR ONLINE AND MOBILE COMMERCE.

2012

HIGHLIGHTS

COMPARED WITH 2011, WE DELIVERED.



TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE OF $31.6 BILLION, UP 5 PERCENT FROM $30.0 BILLION



NET INCOME OF $4.5 BILLION, DOWN 9 PERCENT FROM $4.9 BILLION



DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BASED ON NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF $3.89, DOWN 6 PERCENT FROM $4.12



RETURN ON AVERAGE EQUITY OF 23.1 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH 27.7 PERCENT

OUR RESULTS FOR 2012 CONTINUED TO REFLECT STRONG SPENDING GROWTH AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY.

THE RATE OF GROWTH WAS, HOWEVER, SLOWER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING IN PART THE IMPACT OF A CHALLENGING GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO SAW OUR AVERAGE LOANS CONTINUE TO GROW MODESTLY YEAR OVER YEAR, LEADING TO A 6 PERCENT GROWTH IN NET

INTEREST INCOME WHILE LENDING LOSS RATES ARE NEAR ALL-TIME LOWS. RESULTS FOR 2012 WERE IMPACTED BY THREE CHARGES TAKEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012 RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING OF $400 MILLION, MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ESTIMATION PROCESS ENHANCEMENTS OF $342

MILLION AND CARDMEMBER REIMBURSEMENTS OF $153 MILLION IN ADDITION TO AMOUNTS INCURRED IN PRIOR QUARTERS DURING THE YEAR.



INTEREST ON LOANS, WHICH PRINCIPALLY REPRESENT INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES

OUR GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING AND PROCESSING BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL IN SCOPE.

WE ARE A WORLD LEADER IN PROVIDING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. THESE CARDS INCLUDE CARDS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS AS WELL AS CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED BY

MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (COLLECTIVELY, CARDS). AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS PERMIT CARDMEMBERS TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT THE MILLIONS OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS

BEARING OUR LOGO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE HAD TOTAL WORLDWIDE CARDS-IN-FORCE OF 102.4 MILLION (INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES). IN 2012, OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS (SPENDING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CARDS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS $888.4 BILLION.

OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, ALTHOUGH TRAVEL SALES GENERALLY TEND

TO BE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS. TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES TEND TO BE GREATEST EACH YEAR IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD QUARTER. AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

GIFT CARD SALES ARE HIGHEST IN THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER; AND CARD BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IN OTHER

QUARTERS.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK AND SPEND-CENTRIC MODEL

WE BELIEVE OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK AND SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS MODEL CONTINUE TO BE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES BY

GIVING US THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS, MERCHANTS AND OUR CARD-ISSUING PARTNERS.

WHEREVER WE MANAGE BOTH

THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS AND THE CARD-ISSUING SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A CLOSED-LOOP, WHICH DISTINGUISHES OUR NETWORK FROM THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, IN THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD

TRANSACTION. WE MAINTAIN DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH OUR CARDMEMBERS (AS A CARD ISSUER) AND OUR MERCHANTS (AS AN ACQUIRER), AND WE HANDLE ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. THIS ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND

BUILD ALGORITHMS AND OTHER ANALYTICAL TOOLS THAT ENABLE US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING AND OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS AND SERVICES TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE PROTECT THE

CONFIDENTIALITY OF CARDMEMBER DATA, INCLUDING INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING, IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, INFORMATION SECURITY AND FIREWALL POLICIES; APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS, RULES

AND REGULATIONS (HEREINAFTER, PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS); AND ANTITRUST AND OTHER APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

OUR SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS MODEL FOCUSES ON GENERATING REVENUES PRIMARILY BY DRIVING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND SECONDARILY BY FINANCE CHARGES AND FEES. SPENDING ON OUR CARDS, WHICH IS HIGHER

ON AVERAGE ON A PER-CARD BASIS VERSUS OUR COMPETITORS, OFFERS GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN THE FORM OF LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND HIGHER SALES. THIS ENABLES US TO EARN DISCOUNT REVENUE THAT ALLOWS US TO INVEST MORE IN GREATER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR

MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS. BECAUSE OF THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM HIGHER-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS, WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO INVEST IN MORE ATTRACTIVE REWARDS AND OTHER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBERS, AS WELL AS TARGETED MARKETING AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND

INVESTMENTS FOR MERCHANTS, ALL OF WHICH IN TURN CREATE INCENTIVES FOR CARDMEMBERS TO SPEND MORE ON THEIR CARDS. THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE MAKE IN REWARDS AND OTHER COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITIONS FOR CARDMEMBERS INCENT CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS AND

CARDMEMBER LOYALTY.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES  TRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY, QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE  ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. WE

CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR BRAND, AND OUR PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE EVIDENCE OF OUR COMMITMENT TO ITS ATTRIBUTES. OUR BRAND HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN RATED ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE BRANDS IN THE WORLD IN PUBLISHED STUDIES, AND WE BELIEVE IT

PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS, AND WE INVEST HEAVILY

IN MANAGING, MARKETING AND PROMOTING IT. IN ADDITION, WE PLACE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS AND PATENTS, AND DILIGENTLY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES

THE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES (GNMS) SEGMENT OPERATES A GLOBAL PAYMENTS NETWORK THAT PROCESSES AND SETTLES

PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY CARD TRANSACTIONS. GNMS ACQUIRES MERCHANTS AND PROVIDES POINT-OF-SALE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, MULTI-CHANNEL MARKETING PROGRAMS AND CAPABILITIES, SERVICES AND DATA, LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. IT ENTERS

INTO PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY CARD ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS, LICENSING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND EXTENDING THE REACH OF THE GLOBAL NETWORK.

THE MAJORITY OF CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE ISSUED BY OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, TRS, BY THE COMPANYS U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK (CENTURION

BANK) AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB (AEBFSB), AND BY OTHER OPERATING AND BANKING SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, OUR GNS BUSINESS ESTABLISHES AND MAINTAINS RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS

AROUND THE WORLD THAT ISSUE CARDS AND, IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, ACQUIRE LOCAL MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GNS IS KEY TO OUR STRATEGY OF BROADENING THE CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE

ACCEPTED AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS AND, DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, THEY ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED AT ATM LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT CARDS.

OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES (GMS) BUSINESS PROVIDES US WITH ACCESS TO RICH TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK,

WHICH ENCOMPASSES RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THE CARDMEMBER AND THE MERCHANT. THIS CAPABILITY HELPS US ACQUIRE NEW MERCHANTS, DEEPEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING MERCHANTS, PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, AND PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING, ANALYTICAL AND OTHER

VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK. IN ADDITION, IT ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE TRENDS AND SPENDING PATTERNS AMONG VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE.

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE A STRATEGY,

THROUGH OUR GNS BUSINESS, OF INVITING U.S. AND FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE CARDS AND, IN SOME COUNTRIES, ACT AS MERCHANT ACQUIRERS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL OF THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WE BROADEN OUR CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. THIS STRATEGY ALSO ENABLES US TO ENHANCE OUR PRESENCE IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE ALREADY DO BUSINESS AND EXPAND OUR PRESENCE INTO NEW GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AT

ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. THE GNS BUSINESS HAS ESTABLISHED 148 CARD-ISSUING AND/OR MERCHANT-ACQUIRING ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN 160 COUNTRIES. IN ASSESSING WHETHER WE

SHOULD PURSUE A PROPRIETARY OR GNS STRATEGY IN A GIVEN COUNTRY, OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF, WE CONSIDER A WIDE RANGE OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STABILITY AND ATTRACTIVENESS OF FINANCIAL RETURNS, THE SIZE OF THE AFFLUENT SEGMENT, THE

STRENGTH OF AVAILABLE MARKETING AND CREDIT DATA, THE SIZE OF CO-BRAND OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW WE CAN BEST CREATE STRONG MERCHANT VALUE.

IN 2012, GNS SIGNED 12 NEW PARTNERS TO ISSUE CARDS AND/OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, INCLUDING NEW CARD-ISSUING PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCOTIABANK IN CANADA, CHINA MINGSHENG BANKING

CORP., LTD IN CHINA, URALSIB IN RUSSIA AND A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH G-XCHANGE, INC. TO DEVELOP AN ONLINE PAYMENT SOLUTION IN THE PHILIPPINES. GNS ALSO SUPPORTED EXISTING PARTNERS IN LAUNCHING APPROXIMATELY 84 NEW PRODUCTS DURING 2012, WITH THE TOTAL

NUMBER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS PARTNER PRODUCTS STANDING AT OVER 1,000. NEW PRODUCTS LAUNCHED IN 2012 INCLUDE THE

CENTURION

®

CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS ISSUED BY INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA AND BY CHINA MERCHANTS

BANK IN CHINA; THE JAL AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CARD ISSUED BY MITSUBISHI UFJ NICOS IN JAPAN; BLUE FROM AMERICAN

EXPRESS

®

ISSUED BY RUSSIAN STANDARD BANK IN RUSSIA; THE EASY CARD ISSUED BY GARANTI BANK IN TURKEY; THE EZ LINK

IMAGINE AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

PREPAID CARD ISSUED BY EZ LINK PTE LTD IN SINGAPORE; AND AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

VIRTUAL PAY ISSUED BY TENPAY IN CHINA. GNS ALSO CONTINUES TO EXPAND THE AIRLINE CO-BRAND PRODUCTS ISSUED THROUGH GNS

RELATIONSHIPS, LAUNCHING 4 NEW AIRLINE CO-BRANDS IN 2012 BRINGING THE TOTAL TO 61 AIRLINE CO-BRAND GNS PRODUCTS.

GNS FOCUSES

ON PARTNERING WITH QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT CHOOSE TO ISSUE CARDS ACCEPTED ON OUR GLOBAL NETWORK AND/OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK. ALTHOUGH WE CUSTOMIZE OUR NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS TO THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND

EACH PARTNERS REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANS IN THAT MARKETPLACE, ALL GNS

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ISSUERS DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR THEIR HIGHEST-SPENDING AND MOST AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND TO SUPPORT THE VALUE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MERCHANTS. WE

CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT SHARE A CORE SET OF ATTRIBUTES COMPATIBLE WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, SUCH AS COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS AND STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND WE REQUIRE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRODUCT, BRAND AND

SERVICE STANDARDS.

**

WITH OVER 1,000 DIFFERENT CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED ON OUR NETWORK SO FAR BY OUR PARTNERS, GNS IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT IS

STRENGTHENING OUR BRAND VISIBILITY AROUND THE WORLD, DRIVING MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO OUR MERCHANT NETWORK AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS CHOOSING TO ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. GNS ENABLES US TO EXPAND OUR NETWORKS GLOBAL

PRESENCE GENERALLY WITHOUT ASSUMING ADDITIONAL CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK OR HAVING TO INVEST A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, AS OUR GNS PARTNERS ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED ATTRACTIVE CUSTOMER BASES TO WHOM THEY CAN TARGET AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED PRODUCTS,

AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CARDS THEY ISSUE. SINCE 1999, CARDS-IN-FORCE ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS HAVE GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 22%, AND TOTALED OVER 37 MILLION CARDS AT THE END OF 2012.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 78% OF NEW CARDS ISSUED IN 2012 WERE CARDS ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS. SPENDING ON GNS CARDS HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE OF 24% SINCE 1999. YEAR-OVER-YEAR SPENDING GROWTH ON THESE CARDS IN 2012 WAS 10%,

WITH TOTAL SPENDING EQUAL TO $129 BILLION.

GNS ARRANGEMENTS

ALTHOUGH THE STRUCTURES AND DETAILS OF EACH OF THE GNS ARRANGEMENTS VARY, ALL OF THEM GENERATE REVENUES FOR US FROM THE CARD TRANSACTION

VOLUMES THEY DRIVE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GROSS REVENUES WE RECEIVE PER DOLLAR SPENT ON A CARD ISSUED BY A GNS PARTNER ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE FROM OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GNS PARTNER IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE OPERATING COSTS AND RISK OF ITS CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND CREDIT LOSSES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE IN OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. THE GNS BUSINESS MODEL GENERATES AN ATTRACTIVE

EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE THAT REQUIRES A LOWER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SUPPORT. THE RETURN ON EQUITY IN OUR GNS BUSINESS CAN THUS BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE MAJORITY OF GNS

COSTS ARE FIXED, THE GNS BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SCALABLE. GNS PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND AND DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS WITH

INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.

OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS FALL INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE MAIN CATEGORIES: INDEPENDENT OPERATOR

ARRANGEMENTS, NETWORK CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS AND JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS.

INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS.

THE FIRST TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT

IS KNOWN AS AN INDEPENDENT OPERATOR (IO) ARRANGEMENT. AS OF THE END OF 2012, WE HAD 67 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO EXPAND THE PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE

DO NOT OFFER A PROPRIETARY LOCAL CURRENCY CARD. THE PARTNERS LOCAL PRESENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS HELP US ENHANCE THE IMPACT OF OUR BRAND IN THE COUNTRY, REACH MERCHANT COVERAGE GOALS MORE QUICKLY, AND OPERATE AT ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS

THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. SUBJECT TO MEETING OUR STANDARDS, IO PARTNERS ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS IN THEIR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CLASSIC GREEN, GOLD AND PLATINUM CARD

®

. IN ADDITION, MOST OF THESE PARTNERS SERVE AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR FOR LOCAL MERCHANTS. AMERICAN

EXPRESS RETAINS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MULTINATIONAL MERCHANTS. OUR IO PARTNERS OWN THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIT RISK FOR THE CARDS THEY ISSUE, AND MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL BE ISSUED CARDS. GNS GENERATES REVENUES IN IO

ARRANGEMENTS FROM CARD LICENSING FEES, ROYALTIES ON CARDMEMBER BILLINGS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONVERSION REVENUE, ROYALTIES ON CHARGE VOLUME AT MERCHANTS, SHARE OF DISCOUNT REVENUE AND, IN SOME PARTNERSHIPS, ROYALTIES ON NET SPREAD REVENUE OR ROYALTIES

ON CARDS-IN-FORCE. OUR IO PARTNERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, BILLING AND PRICING, CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT SERVICING, AND FUNDING CARD RECEIVABLES FOR THEIR CARDS AND PAYABLES FOR THEIR MERCHANTS.

WE BEAR THE CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM THE IO PARTNERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE THIS

RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON AN IO PARTNERS CREDIT RATING AND OTHER INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN IO PARTNER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO

REDUCE THIS RISK.

**

THE USE OF THE TERM PARTNER OR PARTNERING DOES NOT MEAN OR IMPLY A FORMAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP, AND IS NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY TO ALTER THE TERMS OF

AMERICAN EXPRESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THIRD-PARTY ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE ENTERED INTO IO ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE BRAZIL, RUSSIA,

INDONESIA, TURKEY, ECUADOR, COLOMBIA, SOUTH KOREA, MALAYSIA, CROATIA, PERU, PORTUGAL AND VIETNAM. THROUGH OUR IO PARTNERSHIPS, WE BELIEVE WE CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH IN CARDMEMBER SPENDING, CARDS-IN-FORCE AND MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE IN THESE COUNTRIES.

NETWORK CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS.

THE SECOND TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS A NETWORK CARD LICENSE (NCL). AT THE END OF 2012, WE HAD 77 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS

IN PLACE WORLDWIDE. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO INCREASE OUR BRAND PRESENCE AND GAIN SHARE IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE A PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING AND/OR MERCHANT ACQUIRING BUSINESS AND, IN A FEW CASES, THOSE IN WHICH WE HAVE IO PARTNERS. IN AN

NCL ARRANGEMENT, WE GRANT THE THIRD-PARTY INSTITUTION A LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. THE NCL ISSUER OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS FOR ALL CARDS IT ISSUES, PROVIDES CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ITS CARDMEMBERS, AUTHORIZES TRANSACTIONS,

MANAGES BILLING AND CREDIT, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MARKETING THE CARDS, AND DESIGNS CARD PRODUCT FEATURES (INCLUDING REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR CARDMEMBERS), SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS. WE OPERATE THE MERCHANT NETWORK, ROUTE AND PROCESS

CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANTS POINT OF SALE THROUGH SUBMISSION TO THE ISSUER, AND SETTLE WITH ISSUERS. THE NCL IS THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED WITH BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES, UNITED KINGDOM, AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN.

GNS REVENUES IN NCL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING,

ROYALTIES, CURRENCY CONVERSIONS AND LICENSING FEES PAID BY THE NCL ISSUER AND FEES CHARGED TO THE NCL ISSUER BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, PLUS OUR PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SUCH AS CARDMEMBER INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER CARD FEATURES AND

BENEFITS FOR THE NCL ISSUERS CARDS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THE NCL ISSUER BEARS THE CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL AS THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION COSTS, CARDMEMBER FRAUD RISKS AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND OTHER LOYALTY INITIATIVES.

WE BEAR THE RISK ARISING FROM THE NCL ISSUERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY

MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON AN NCL ISSUERS CREDIT RATING AND OTHER

INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN NCL ISSUER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

EXAMPLES OF NCL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANK OF AMERICA IN THE UNITED STATES, LLOYDS TSB BANK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND WESTPAC BANKING CORPORATION IN AUSTRALIA.

JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS.

THE THIRD TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS A JOINT VENTURE (JV) ARRANGEMENT. WE HAVE UTILIZED THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT IN SWITZERLAND

AND BELGIUM, AS WELL AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IN THESE COUNTRIES, WE JOIN WITH A THIRD PARTY TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN WHICH WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP STAKE. THE JV TYPICALLY SIGNS NEW MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK AND ISSUES LOCAL AND U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED CURRENCY CARDS THAT CARRY OUR LOGO. IN A JV ARRANGEMENT, THE JV IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK AND BEARS THE OPERATING AND MARKETING COSTS. UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO TYPES OF GNS

ARRANGEMENTS, WE SHARE MANAGEMENT, RISK, AND PROFIT AND LOSS RESPONSIBILITY WITH OUR JV PARTNERS. INCOME IS GENERATED BY DISCOUNT REVENUES, CARD FEES AND NET SPREAD REVENUES. THE ECONOMICS OF THE JV ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OUR PROPRIETARY

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, WHICH WE DISCUSS UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES, AND WE RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE JVS INCOME DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST. OUR SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS OVERSEAS

CREDIT CORPORATION LIMITED, PURCHASES CARD RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF THE GNS JVS FROM TIME TO TIME.

GLOBAL

MERCHANT SERVICES

OUR GMS BUSINESS BUILDS AND MAINTAINS RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS, PROCESSES CARD TRANSACTIONS AND

SETTLES WITH MERCHANTS THAT CHOOSE TO ACCEPT CARDS FOR CARD PURCHASES (CHARGES). WE SIGN MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS AND PROVIDE MARKETING INFORMATION AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO MERCHANTS, LEVERAGING THE CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY

OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. WE ALSO OFFER POINT-OF-SALE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SUPPORT FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE, FRAUD PREVENTION AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES. CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN THE GMS BUSINESS WERE A KEY PRIORITY IN 2012 AND WILL REMAIN SO IN

2013.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS FOR CARDMEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE CARD WHEREVER AND HOWEVER THEY DESIRE, AND TO INCREASE MERCHANT

ACCEPTANCE IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED THE CARD. WE ADD NEW MERCHANTS TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER OF SALES CHANNELS: AN IN-HOUSE SALES FORCE; THIRD-PARTY SALES AND SERVICE AGENTS; STRATEGIC

ALLIANCES WITH BANKS AND PROCESSORS; THE INTERNET; TELEMARKETING; AND INBOUND WANT TO HONOR CALLS (I.E., WHERE MERCHANTS DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD CONTACT US DIRECTLY). AS DISCUSSED IN THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES SECTION,

OUR IO PARTNERS AND JVS ALSO ADD NEW LOCAL MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2012, WE CONTINUED EXPANDING OUR INTEGRATED AMERICAN EXPRESS

ONEPOINT

®

PROGRAM BY ADDING THIRD-PARTY AGENTS TO SERVICE MANY OF OUR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE AGENTS IDENTIFY POTENTIAL NEW MERCHANTS AND PROVIDE PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES TO MERCHANTS ON OUR BEHALF FOR CARD TRANSACTIONS, WHILE WE RETAIN THE ACCEPTANCE CONTRACT WITH PARTICIPATING

MERCHANTS, MANAGE THE MERCHANT PRICING PROCESS, AND RECEIVE THE SAME TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION WE ALWAYS HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. THIS PROGRAM SIMPLIFIES CARD PROCESSING FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS BY PROVIDING THEM

WITH A SINGLE SOURCE FOR STATEMENTS, SETTLEMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE HAVE SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS IN SPAIN WITH LA CAIXA AND IN MEXICO WITH ELAVON.

GMS CONTINUES TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD IN ORDER TO ADDRESS CARDMEMBER NEEDS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE

FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE USE OF OUR CARDS FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 64% OF OUR U.S. BILLINGS CAME FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 36% CAME FROM RETAIL AND OTHER SECTORS. IN 2012, ONLY 27% OF U.S. BILLINGS CAME

FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS. THIS SHIFT RESULTED, IN PART, FROM THE GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS THAT BEGAN TO ACCEPT PAYMENT CARDS IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS INCREASED DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR MORE OF THEIR

PURCHASES, OUR FOCUS ON EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MEET CARDMEMBERS NEEDS, AND INCREASED COMPETITION FOR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR SPENDING.

DURING 2012, WE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO BRING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO INDUSTRIES WHERE CASH OR CHECKS ARE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF PAYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE MADE HEADWAY IN PROMOTING CARD ACCEPTANCE IN

INDUSTRIES SUCH AS PHARMACEUTICALS, CONSTRUCTION, INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY AND INSURANCE. WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR DRIVE TO EXPAND CARD ACCEPTANCE FOR RETAIL, EVERYDAY AND BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SPENDING CATEGORIES.

GLOBALLY, ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL-PURPOSE CARDS CONTINUES TO INCREASE. AS IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2012, WE CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT

ACCEPTANCE OF CARDS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO REFINE OUR APPROACH TO CALCULATING MERCHANT COVERAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE. WE ESTIMATE THAT, AS OF THE END OF 2012, OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN

90% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD SPENDING. OUR INTERNATIONAL SPEND COVERAGE IS MORE LIMITED, ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT

NETWORK AS A WHOLE ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN 80% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD SPENDING. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE BASED ON COMPARING OUR CARDMEMBERS SPENDING ON OUR NETWORK CURRENTLY WITH OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT OUR CARDMEMBERS WOULD

SPEND ON OUR NETWORK IF ALL MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT GENERAL-PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS ACCEPTED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

DISCOUNT REVENUE

WE EARN DISCOUNT REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AS PAYMENT FOR GOODS OR SERVICES SOLD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT, OR DISCOUNT RATE, IS A FEE CHARGED TO THE MERCHANT FOR

ACCEPTING CARDS AND IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGE AMOUNT. IN SOME INSTANCES, AN ADDITIONAL FLAT TRANSACTION FEE IS ASSESSED AS PART OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE

PAYMENT THAT THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER (IN MOST CASES, TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) PAYS TO A MERCHANT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE MERCHANT, ACCEPTS TRANSACTIONS

FROM THE MERCHANT, PAYS THE MERCHANT FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, WHICH SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE CARD ISSUER. WHEN A CARDMEMBER PRESENTS THE CARD FOR PAYMENT, THE MERCHANT

CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR THE TRANSACTION AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE TIME

THE TRANSACTION IS RECEIVED BY US FROM THE MERCHANT. WE MAY ALSO CHARGE ADDITIONAL FEES TO MERCHANTS, SUCH AS A VARIABLE FEE FOR NON-SWIPED CARD TRANSACTIONS OR FOR TRANSACTIONS USING CARDS ISSUED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND USED AT

MERCHANTS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES.

WHERE WE ACT AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE CARD PRESENTED AT A MERCHANT IS ISSUED

BY A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF OUR GNS PARTNERS, WE WILL MAKE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT TO THE MERCHANT AND RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT REVENUE. IN OUR ROLE AS THE OPERATOR OF THE CARD NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO RECEIVE

FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT FROM THE GNS CARD ISSUER, WHO RECEIVES AN ISSUER RATE (I.E., THE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AMOUNT THAT GNS CARD ISSUERS RECEIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS CHARGED ON OUR NETWORK WITH CARDS THEY ISSUE, WHICH IS USUALLY EXPRESSED AS A

PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGE AMOUNT). THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT REVENUE (RECEIVED BY US IN THE FORM OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT) AND THE ISSUER RATE RECEIVED BY THE GNS CARD ISSUER GENERATES A RETURN TO US. IN CASES WHERE AMERICAN EXPRESS IS THE

CARD ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (WHICH CAN BE THE CASE IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH THE IO IS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER), WE RECEIVE AN INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED NETWORK RATE IN OUR SETTLEMENT WITH THE

MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WHICH IS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE. BY CONTRAST WITH NETWORKS SUCH AS THOSE OPERATED BY VISA INC. (VISA) AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC. (MASTERCARD), THERE IS NO

COLLECTIVELY SET INTERCHANGE RATE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND NO FEES ARE AGREED OR DUE BETWEEN THIRD-PARTY BANKS OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON THE NETWORK.

THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMS DEPICT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE PARTIES IN A POINT-OF-SALE TRANSACTION EFFECTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK WHERE WE ACT AS BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND MERCHANT ACQUIRER (THE

3-PARTY MODEL) AND UNDER AN NCL ARRANGEMENT WHERE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACT AS CARD ISSUERS (THE NCL MODEL).

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT WE CHARGE REFLECTS THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO THE MERCHANT AND THE INVESTMENTS WE

MAKE IN PROVIDING THAT VALUE. WE DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS RELATIVE TO USERS OF CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETING CARD NETWORKS, OUR PRODUCT AND NETWORK FEATURES AND

FUNCTIONALITY, OUR MARKETING EXPERTISE AND PROGRAMS, INFORMATION SERVICES, FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES, OUR DEDICATED CLIENT MANAGEMENT GROUP, AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ENHANCE THE MERCHANT VALUE PROPOSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD.

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT VARIES WITH, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE MERCHANT DOES BUSINESS, THE MERCHANTS

CHARGE VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT TO THE MERCHANT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF THE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH US (E.G., LOCAL OR GLOBAL) AND THE CHARGE AMOUNT. IN

THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, WE CHARGE A DIFFERENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR OUR PREPAID CARDS.

IN RECENT YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SOME

REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE. THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE WAS 2.52 PERCENT AND 2.54 PERCENT FOR 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. OVER TIME, CERTAIN REPRICING INITIATIVES, CHANGES IN THE MIX OF SPENDING BY LOCATION

AND INDUSTRY, AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF PREPAID PRODUCTS, VOLUME-RELATED PRICING DISCOUNTS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN FURTHER EROSION OF THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENTIATED PAYMENT MODELS FROM

NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE (SUCH AS PAYPAL AND SQUARE) COULD POSE CHALLENGES TO OUR TRADITIONAL PAYMENT MODEL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE OR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR

CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK.

WHILE WE BELIEVE MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS UNDERSTAND OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT PRICING IN RELATION TO

THE VALUE PROVIDED, WE DO ENCOUNTER MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, BUT TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER TO ACCEPT ANOTHER TYPE OF

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PAYMENT OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO SUPPRESS USE OF THE CARD. OUR CARDMEMBERS VALUE THE ABILITY TO USE THEIR CARDS WHERE AND WHEN THEY WANT TO, AND WE, THEREFORE, TAKE STEPS TO MEET OUR

CARDMEMBERS EXPECTATIONS AND TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, SUBJECT TO LOCAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK) IN THE UNITED STATES. WE MAKE EFFORTS TO

LIMIT CARD SUPPRESSION BY FOCUSING ON ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD; CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE PROVIDE TO MERCHANTS THROUGH MARKETING PROGRAMS SUCH AS OUR SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY

®

EVENT TARGETED TO ENCOURAGE CARDMEMBERS TO SHOP AT SMALL MERCHANTS; PROVIDING EARLIER AND MORE FREQUENT

COMMUNICATION OF OUR VALUE PROPOSITION; AND HAVE THE RIGHT, WHEN APPROPRIATE, TO TERMINATE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS WHO SEEK TO SUPPRESS THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS. WE HAVE A CLIENT MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO GROWING OUR

MERCHANTS BUSINESS AND FINDING WAYS TO ENHANCE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS THE MERCHANTS CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND THAT

ALL MERCHANTS HAVE NUMEROUS OPTIONS GIVEN THE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW AND TRADITIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT. THEREFORE, WE DEDICATE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO DELIVERING SUPERIOR AND DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR MERCHANTS.

THE LAWS OF TEN STATES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES PROHIBIT THE SURCHARGING OF

CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. CONVERSELY, THERE ARE CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN WHICH SURCHARGING IS SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN ADDITION, THE SETTLEMENT BY MASTERCARD AND VISA IN A U.S. MERCHANT CLASS

LITIGATION (WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN PRELIMINARY, BUT NOT FINAL, APPROVAL BY THE TRIAL COURT) REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MASTERCARD AND VISA TO PERMIT U.S. MERCHANTS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, TO SURCHARGE CREDIT CARDS, WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO

CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT SURCHARGES ON DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS. OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS GENERALLY DO NOT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING OUR CARDMEMBERS. HOWEVER, WHERE PERMITTED BY LOCAL LAW, OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS

GENERALLY INCLUDE A PROVISION UNDER WHICH THE MERCHANT AGREES NOT TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE CARD, SUCH AS BY SURCHARGING HIGHER AMOUNTS ON PURCHASES WITH THE CARD THAN ON PURCHASES WITH ANY OTHER CARDS THE MERCHANT ACCEPTS OR BY IMPOSING A

SURCHARGE ONLY ON CARD PURCHASES, BUT NOT ON PURCHASES MADE WITH OTHER CARDS. AMERICAN EXPRESS DOES NOT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY WITH CASH, CHECK OR INTER-BANK TRANSFERS (I.E., AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE OR

ACH). IN ADDITION, AMERICAN EXPRESS DOES NOT PROHIBIT U.S. MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR IN-KIND INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK. FOR INFORMATION ON

THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF SURCHARGING ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE 

AN INCREASING PREVALENCE OF SURCHARGING BY MERCHANTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ENHANCING MERCHANT SATISFACTION

GMS IS FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MERCHANT SATISFACTION, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND EXECUTING PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS, USING TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES

AND INNOVATIVE MARKETING TOOLS SUCH AS SOCIAL MEDIA AND APPLYING OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITIES AND DEEP MARKETING EXPERTISE. IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ALSO OFFER OUR MERCHANTS A FULL RANGE OF POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATED POINT-OF-SALE

TERMINALS, SOFTWARE, ONLINE SOLUTIONS AND DIRECT LINKS THAT ALLOW MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS (AS WELL AS CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON OTHER NETWORKS AND CHECKS). VIRTUALLY ALL PROPRIETARY POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS SUPPORT DIRECT

PROCESSING (I.E., DIRECT CONNECTIVITY) TO AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH CAN LOWER A MERCHANTS COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE AND ENHANCE PAYMENT EFFICIENCY.

IN 2012, WE CONTINUED TO CONNECT MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS VIA OUR CARD SYNC PLATFORM AND SMART OFFER APIS, LAUNCHING SYNC, TWEET, SAVE WITH TWITTER FOR U.S. CARDMEMBERS AND SYNC,

UNLOCK, SCORE WITH THE ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT SERVICE FROM MICROSOFT, XBOX LIVE, FOR CARDMEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. WE ALSO LAUNCHED OFFERS VIA FOURSQUARE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND MY OFFERS IN THE UNITED STATES, A

MOBILE OFFER ENGINE THAT RECOMMENDS AND RANKS RELEVANT MERCHANT OFFERS IN REAL TIME FOR U.S. CARDMEMBERS BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL SPEND GRAPHS. A PILOT OF MY OFFERS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS IPHONE APP MADE AVAILABLE LOCAL OFFERS FOR

CARDMEMBERS IN LOS ANGELES AND NEW YORK CITY AND CERTAIN OFFERS FOR CARDMEMBERS NATIONWIDE.

WE OFFER FRAUD PREVENTION

SERVICES TO MERCHANTS FOR TRANSACTIONS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, AND OUR SUBSIDIARY, ACCERTIFY INC., WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN NOVEMBER 2010, IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF SOLUTIONS THAT HELP MERCHANTS COMBAT FRAUDULENT ONLINE AND OTHER

CARD-NOT-PRESENT TRANSACTIONS. ACCERTIFY PROVIDES A HOSTED SOFTWARE APPLICATION THAT OFFERS AN EXTRA LEVEL OF SECURITY FOR TRANSACTIONS ON ANY OF THE MAJOR PAYMENT NETWORKS, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DISCOVER AND PAYPAL, OR USING

ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHOD. ACCERTIFY ALSO OFFERS MERCHANTS THE OPTION TO OUTSOURCE THEIR END-TO-END FRAUD MANAGEMENT PROCESS TO ACCERTIFY AND PROVIDES OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO OFFER MERCHANT FINANCING, A SET OF FINANCING PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDES QUALIFIED

MERCHANTS WITH ACCESS TO A CONVENIENT SOURCE OF FINANCING FOR THEIR BUSINESS NEEDS THROUGH THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS. THE FINANCING OFFERED IS A COMMERCIAL LOAN, WHICH IS REPAID AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE MERCHANTS DAILY CHARGE

SUBMISSIONS AND ACCOMPANIED BY LOW FIXED FEES.

OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK AND RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW US TO ANALYZE MERCHANT DATA

AND INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. THIS ENABLES US TO OFFER A RANGE OF TARGETED MARKETING SERVICES, NETWORK CAPABILITIES AND SPECIAL OFFERS FOR THE BENEFIT OF MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE PROTECT

THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF CARDMEMBER INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING, IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, INFORMATION SECURITY AND FIREWALL POLICIES, APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY

LAWS, AND ANTITRUST AND OTHER APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN THE INFORMATION THAT SUPPORTS KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS CLOSED LOOP, PROVIDING VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS AND

MERCHANTS.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN AREAS THAT MAKE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD MORE SECURE AND CONVENIENT FOR

MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS. WE PARTICIPATE IN STANDARD-SETTING BODIES, SUCH AS EMVCO, GLOBALPLATFORM AND PCI SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL, LLC, DESIGNED TO HELP DRIVE SECURE AND INTEROPERABLE PAYMENTS GLOBALLY. OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT OUR CARDS, FOR CARDMEMBERS TO HAVE SEAMLESS EXPERIENCES AT THE POINT OF SALE, AND FOR ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS THAT HAVE MORE THAN ONE NETWORK RELATIONSHIP TO HAVE A UNIFORM TECHNOLOGY STANDARD ACROSS THEIR CARD PRODUCTS AND

PLATFORMS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE EFFORTS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CONTACTLESS CARDS AND MOBILE PHONES MOVE THE PAYMENT INDUSTRY INCREASINGLY AWAY FROM MAG-STRIPE TRANSACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE OFFER A CONTACTLESS

PAYMENT FEATURE EMBEDDED IN CERTAIN CARDS, TO PROVIDE A FAST, EASY-TO-USE ALTERNATIVE TO CASH, CHECK, DEBIT OR OTHER PAYMENT FORMS, PARTICULARLY FOR MAKING EVERYDAY PURCHASES AT MERCHANTS WHERE SPEED AND CONVENIENCE ARE IMPORTANT.

BILLING DISPUTES

AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WE HAVE CERTAIN EXPOSURES THAT ARISE IF A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE CARDMEMBER. DRIVERS OF THIS LIABILITY ARE RETURNS IN THE

NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER FRAUDULENT CHARGES, THE QUALITY OR NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES, AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, WE OFFSET THE AMOUNT DUE TO THE CARDMEMBER AGAINST PAYMENTS FOR THE MERCHANTS CURRENT OR FUTURE

CHARGE SUBMISSIONS. WE CAN REALIZE LOSSES WHEN A MERCHANTS OFFSETTING CHARGE SUBMISSIONS CEASE, SUCH AS WHEN THE MERCHANT DECIDES TO NO LONGER ACCEPT THE CARD OR GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE RISK OF

THIS EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN MERCHANT BY ESTABLISHING RESERVES OF CHARGE PAYABLE HOLDBACKS FROM A MERCHANT, LENGTHENING THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE MERCHANT SUBMITS A CHARGE FOR PAYMENT AND

WHEN WE PAY THE MERCHANT, REQUIRING THE MERCHANT TO SECURE A LETTER OF CREDIT OR A PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE, OR IMPLEMENTING OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS. WE ALSO ESTABLISH RESERVES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES IN

ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING RULES.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICESCOMPETITION

OUR GLOBAL CARD NETWORK COMPETES IN THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WITH OTHER CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, VISA, MASTERCARD,

DINERS CLUB INTERNATIONAL (WHICH IS OWNED BY DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES), DISCOVER (PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES) AND JCB AND CHINA UNIONPAY (PRIMARILY IN ASIA). WE ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK ON A GLOBAL BASIS BASED ON

PURCHASE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA, MASTERCARD AND CHINA UNIONPAY. IN ADDITION TO SUCH NETWORKS, A RANGE OF COMPANIES GLOBALLY, INCLUDING MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND PROCESSORS AND COMPANIES SUCH AS PAYPAL, CARRY OUT SOME ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE PERFORMED

BY OUR GMS AND GNS BUSINESSES. NO OTHER SINGLE ENTITY ENGAGES ON A GLOBAL BASIS IN THE FULL RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ENCOMPASSED BY OUR CLOSED-LOOP BUSINESS MODEL.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK AND MERCHANT SERVICE BUSINESSES INCLUDE.



THE NUMBER OF CARDS-IN-FORCE AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THESE CARDS



THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THE CARDS CAN BE USED



THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANTS OF PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK

THE COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE RELATIVE TO THE VALUE PROVIDED

ANOTHER ASPECT OF NETWORK COMPETITION IS THE RECENT EMERGENCE AND RAPID GROWTH OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDE AGGREGATORS (SUCH AS PAYPAL, SQUARE AND AMAZON), WIRELESS

PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), ELECTRONIC WALLET PROVIDERS, PREPAID SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY PROVIDED BY SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND

NETWORKING, ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS SUCH AS MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND AGGREGATORS ARE WORKING TO DELIVER

DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS. ALTHOUGH WE ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE THE LARGEST VOLUME OF ONLINE SPENDING OF ANY MAJOR CARD ISSUER, COMPETITION REMAINS FIERCE FOR CAPTURING AND MAINTAINING ONLINE SPEND IN THE

EVER-INCREASING DIGITAL WORLD, AND ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS MODELS PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. FOR EXAMPLE, UNLIKE US, AGGREGATORS LIKE PAYPAL HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE PAYMENT SERVICES TO MERCHANTS FOR MULTIPLE PAYMENT NETWORKS. IN ADDITION, NEW

ENTRANTS TO THE DIGITAL PAYMENTS SPACE SUCH AS ONLINE, SOCIAL MEDIA, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES REPRESENT ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE AND POTENTIALLY DISINTERMEDIATING FACTORS IN THE CARD PAYMENT INDUSTRY GIVEN THE SCALE OF THEIR

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND LARGE CASH RESERVES AND OTHER RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP NEW PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGIES, AND THEIR STRATEGIES TO USE PAYMENTS AS A TOOL TO SUPPORT OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE.

TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, SUCH AS AGGREGATORS, CONTINUE TO EXPAND SUCCESSFULLY, DISCOUNT REVENUES AND

POTENTIALLY OTHER REVENUES, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED

ON ACH CONTINUE TO EMERGE AND GROW, MERCHANTS WITH RECURRING BILLING MODELS ACTIVELY SEEK TO SWITCH CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT THROUGH DIRECT DEBITS FROM BANK ACCOUNTS, AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND BOTH ON- AND OFF-LINE AND ARE

MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD FURTHER REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE EMERGING PAYMENTS AREA, SEE ENTERPRISE GROWTH

GROUP  ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS  COMPETITION UNDER CORPORATE & OTHER BELOW.

SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE OUR CLOSED-LOOP FUNCTIONALITY. EFFORTS BY SOME CARD NETWORKS, PAYMENT PROVIDERS AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS TO REPLICATE THE CLOSED LOOP REFLECT ITS CONTINUED VALUE AND THE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA, THIRD-PARTY PROCESSORS AND

SOME ACQUIRERS OFFER MERCHANTS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVERTING PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF THE CARDHOLDERS RESIDENCE (I.E., THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE POINT-OF-SALE, AND SUBMITTING THE

TRANSACTION IN THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS OF THE CARD NETWORK. THIS PRACTICE, KNOWN AS DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION, REDUCES OR ELIMINATES REVENUE FOR CARD

ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CHARGES TO THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY. THIS PRACTICE IS STILL NOT WIDESPREAD, AND IT REMAINS UNCERTAIN WHETHER ITS USE WILL EXPAND OVER TIME. OUR POLICY GENERALLY REQUIRES

MERCHANTS TO SUBMIT CHARGES AND BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND WE CONVERT THE TRANSACTION TO THE CARDMEMBERS BILLING CURRENCY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  REGULATION

LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING GNS ARRANGEMENTS

WITH BANKS AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CARDS AND, IN THE CASE OF OUR IO ARRANGEMENTS, TO OPERATE MERCHANT-ACQUIRING BUSINESSES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR

GNS PARTNERS HAVE GENERALLY NOT HAD DIFFICULTY OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO GNS ARRANGEMENTS. AS A SERVICE PROVIDER TO REGULATED U.S. BANKS, OUR GNS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO

REVIEW BY CERTAIN FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) AND THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC).

AS THE OPERATOR OF A GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENCY AND FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS

REPORTING ACT AND THE ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE BANK SECRECY ACT), AS AMENDED BY THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE PATRIOT ACT). WE CONDUCT DUE

DILIGENCE ON OUR GNS PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) CONTROLS TO PREVENT OUR NETWORK FROM BEING USED FOR MONEY LAUNDERING OR TERRORIST FINANCING PURPOSES. AS AGGREGATORS

ADD MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR DUE DILIGENCE TO REVIEW AGGREGATORS AML AND KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER POLICIES AND CONTROLS, AND RETAIN THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE TERMINATION OF MERCHANTS CARD

ACCEPTANCE UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BEING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FURTHER REGULATION AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR REGULATORY STATUS, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BELOW.

OVER THE LAST DECADE, REGULATORS

IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS ON CERTAIN CARD NETWORKS AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE.

REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND, ITALY, SWITZERLAND, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING, CONCLUDED OR ON APPEAL.

THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN

FOUR-PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE PAYABLE BY MERCHANTS FOR DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE SUCH INTERCHANGE FEES. FOR THIS REASON, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS, THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON THESE NETWORKS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN DECEMBER 2007 THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION (EC) RULED THAT MASTERCARDS MULTILATERAL INTERCHANGE FEES (MIF) FOR CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTIONS VIOLATE EC TREATY RULES ON RESTRICTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES, WHICH WAS UPHELD BY THE EUROPEAN GENERAL

COURT IN 2012. IN 2008, THE EC OPENED FORMAL ANTITRUST PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VISA EUROPE LIMITED IN RELATION TO VISAS MIFS FOR CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS WITHIN EUROPE, AND IN 2010, THE EC ACCEPTED VISA EUROPES PLEDGE TO CUT

ITS CROSS-BORDER DEBIT CARD MIF TO 20 BASIS POINTS FOR FOUR YEARS. WHILE AMERICAN EXPRESS WAS NOT A PARTY TO THE MASTERCARD AND VISA PROCEEDINGS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING TO MERCHANT PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL

NETWORKS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE FROM CONSUMERS SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING

BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, DODD-FRANK GAVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH

RULES REGARDING INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED BY PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS (WHICH INCLUDE TRANSACTIONS USING A DEBIT CARD OR GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARD) AND TO ENFORCE A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT SUCH FEES BE REASONABLE

AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE COST OF A TRANSACTION TO THE ISSUER, WITH SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR THE COSTS OF FRAUD PREVENTION, AS WELL AS TO PROHIBIT EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS. RELOADABLE GENERAL-USE

PREPAID CARDS (BUT NOT THOSE MARKETED OR LABELED AS GIFT CARDS OR GIFT CERTIFICATES) ARE EXEMPT FROM THE INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS PROVIDED THEY MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, ALTHOUGH ALL PREPAID CARDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING

RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS. THE FEDERAL RESERVES RULE PROVIDES THAT THE REGULATIONS ON INTERCHANGE AND ROUTING DO NOT APPLY TO A THREE-PARTY NETWORK LIKE AMERICAN EXPRESS WHEN IT ACTS AS BOTH THE ISSUER AND THE NETWORK FOR

ITS PREPAID CARDS, AND IS THEREFORE NOT A PAYMENT CARD NETWORK AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED AND USED FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF THE RULE. AS A RESULT, AMERICAN EXPRESS IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS RULE WITH REGARD TO THE PREPAID CARDS IT ISSUES.

IN ADDITION TO THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION, SEE 

THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM

OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFERS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER. FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT

REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS

OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT

CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A RESULT OF DODD-FRANK, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT WITH LOWER

COSTS AND INTERCHANGE FEES, SUCH AS DEBIT CARDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES WHERE ANTITRUST ACTIONS OR REGULATIONS HAVE LED OUR COMPETITORS TO LOWER THEIR FEES, WE HAVE MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRICING TO MERCHANTS TO REFLECT LOCAL COMPETITIVE TRENDS. FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCTIONS IN BANKCARD INTERCHANGE MANDATED BY THE

RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA IN 2003 RESULTED IN LOWER MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR VISA AND MASTERCARD ACCEPTANCE. AS A RESULT OF THESE REGULATION-DRIVEN CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, WE REDUCED OUR OWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES IN AUSTRALIA OVER TIME,

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE BILLED BUSINESS AND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING OUR CARDS. WE HAVE SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON OUR CARDS IN AUSTRALIA IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT

IS GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS. IN JUNE 2012, THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA ANNOUNCED CHANGES TO THE AUSTRALIAN SURCHARGING STANDARDS THAT WILL COME INTO FORCE ON MARCH 18, 2013, WHICH WILL ALLOW US AND

OTHER NETWORKS TO LIMIT A MERCHANTS RIGHT TO SURCHARGE TO THE REASONABLE COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE. THIS COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN HIGHER SURCHARGES ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

IN RECENT YEARS, NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN HUNGARY, ITALY AND FRANCE HAVE SOUGHT TO ENACT CAPS ON INTERCHANGE FEES OR POINT-OF-SALE SERVICE

CHARGES WITHOUT GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP FOR THESE MEASURES. ALTHOUGH SUCH LEGISLATION HAS BEEN OR MAY BE EITHER REPEALED OR STRUCK DOWN ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS, IT IS POSSIBLE THERE MAY BE FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO ENACT REGULATION OF MERCHANT FEES OR

INTERCHANGE WITH DIRECT OR INDIRECT IMPACTS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS.

IN JANUARY 2012, THE EC PUBLISHED A GREEN PAPER (A DOCUMENT

TO STIMULATE DEBATE AND BEGIN A PROCESS OF CONSULTATION) ENTITLED TOWARDS AN INTEGRATED EUROPEAN MARKET FOR CARD, INTERNET AND MOBILE PAYMENTS. THE AREA OF FOCUS COVERS A RANGE OF ISSUES AFFECTING THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING

INTERCHANGE FEES, NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS RULES AND CONTRACT PROVISIONS, SURCHARGING, SEPARATION OF PROCESSING FROM CARD NETWORK MANAGEMENT, PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO CROSS-BORDER ACQUIRING, MOBILE PAYMENTS AND TECHNICAL STANDARDIZATION.

THE EC HAS COMPLETED A CONSULTATION PERIOD AND IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE ITS PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS IN EARLY 2013. THESE CONCLUSIONS MAY INVOLVE PROPOSALS FOR REGULATION OR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SELF-REGULATION AND COULD TAKE UP TO 18-24 MONTHS TO ADOPT

AND IMPLEMENT.

IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA IMPLEMENTED A NEW LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK

FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS, CALLED THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 2007/64/EC ON PAYMENT SERVICES. THIS DIRECTIVE, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE (PSD), PRESCRIBES COMMON RULES FOR LICENSING AND

SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PSD IS TO FACILITATE THE OPERATION OF A SINGLE INTERNAL PAYMENTS MARKET IN THE EU

THROUGH HARMONIZATION OF EU MEMBER STATE LAWS GOVERNING PAYMENT SERVICES. ONE PROVISION OF THE PSD PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE, SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, BUT ALSO ALLOWS INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES TO OVERRIDE THIS RULE BY PROHIBITING OR

LIMITING SURCHARGING. TO DATE, THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA ARE SPLIT ON WHETHER THEY PROHIBIT OR PERMIT SURCHARGING, WITH COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM (WHICH FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS HAS PERMITTED IT FOR CREDIT CARD

PURCHASES), THE NETHERLANDS AND SPAIN PERMITTING IT, IN SOME CASES WITHIN LIMITS, AND OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS FRANCE, ITALY AND SWEDEN PROHIBITING IT. ALL MEMBER STATES PERMIT MERCHANTS TO OFFER DISCOUNTS FOR PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT. IN 2012,

THE EC COMMENCED A REVIEW OF THE PSD, AND ITS RECOMMENDATIONS ARE EXPECTED IN EARLY 2013 TOGETHER WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE GREEN PAPER CONSULTATION DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE PSD COMPLEMENTS ANOTHER EUROPEAN INITIATIVE, THE SINGLE EURO PAYMENTS AREA

(SEPA), WHICH IS AN INDUSTRY-LED INITIATIVE WITH SUPPORT FROM EU INSTITUTIONS. AMONG OTHER CHANGES, SEPA INVOLVES THE ADOPTION OF NEW, PAN-EUROPEAN TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR CARDS AND CARD TRANSACTIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH THE PSD, SEPA AND

RELATED REQUIREMENTS HAS INVOLVED SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN. IN ADDITION, THE CONSUMER RIGHTS DIRECTIVE, WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE EU COUNCIL OF MINISTERS IN OCTOBER 2011, WILL PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING CARD PURCHASES MORE

THAN THE MERCHANTS COST OF ACCEPTANCE IN THOSE MEMBER STATES THAT PERMIT SURCHARGING PURSUANT TO THE PSD. THE CONSUMER RIGHTS DIRECTIVE PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE TO MERCHANTS ON HOW TO ASSESS THE COST OF ACCEPTANCE OR TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RELATIVE

VALUE OF DIFFERENT PAYMENT METHODS. A COST-BASED LIMIT ON SURCHARGING COULD RESULT IN MERCHANTS

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPOSING HIGHER SURCHARGES ON AMERICAN EXPRESS TRANSACTIONS IF, IN THE ABSENCE OF CLEAR GUIDANCE, MERCHANTS TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE COST OF AMERICAN EXPRESS ACCEPTANCE IS HIGHER THAN OTHER

PAYMENT CARDS. THE MEMBER STATES HAVE UNTIL THE END OF 2013 TO ADOPT THIS LEGISLATION.

IN 2010, THE CANADIAN COMPETITION

BUREAU COMMENCED A PROCEEDING AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD UNDER THE PRICE MAINTENANCE PROVISIONS OF THE CANADIAN COMPETITION ACT SEEKING A REMEDIAL ORDER PROHIBITING VISA AND MASTERCARD FROM ENTERING INTO, ENFORCING OR IMPOSING TERMS THAT RESTRAIN

MERCHANTS FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING ENCOURAGING USE OF LOWER COST METHODS OF PAYMENT AND DISCOURAGING USE OF CREDIT CARDS WITH HIGHER CARD ACCEPTANCE FEES, DECLINING ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN CREDIT CARDS AND SURCHARGING CUSTOMERS WHO

USE VISA AND MASTERCARD CREDIT CARDS. HEARINGS WERE HELD IN JUNE 2012 AND A DECISION OF THE CANADIAN COMPETITION TRIBUNAL IS PENDING. WHILE THE COMPETITION BUREAU DID NOT NAME AMERICAN EXPRESS IN ITS PROCEEDING, THIS ACTION EVIDENCES THE STRONG

REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL FOCUS ON THIS AREA, WHICH COULD HAVE INDIRECT IMPLICATIONS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS.

GOVERNMENTS IN SOME

COUNTRIES PROVIDE RESOURCES OR PROTECTION TO SELECT DOMESTIC PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS. SUCH SUPPORT COULD KEEP US FROM ENTERING THESE COUNTRIES, TO FORCE US TO LEAVE OR TO RESTRICT SUBSTANTIALLY OUR ACTIVITIES THERE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR REVENUES AND EXTEND OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. FOR EXAMPLE, THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN REGULATIONS THAT SUBSTANTIALLY FAVOR CHINA UNIONPAY, THE DOMINANT RETAIL PAYMENTS NETWORK IN THE CHINESE DOMESTIC

MARKET. A RECENT DECISION OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION ON THIS ISSUE MAY LEAD TO THE FURTHER OPENING OF THE PAYMENTS SYSTEMS IN CHINA, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE EXTENT OR PACE OF CHANGE.

IN SOME COUNTRIES IN ASIA, GOVERNMENTS HAVE ESTABLISHED REGULATORY REGIMES THAT REQUIRE INTERNATIONAL CARD NETWORKS TO BE LOCALLY

LICENSED AND/OR TO LOCALIZE ASPECTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, CARD NETWORK OPERATORS IN INDIA MUST OBTAIN AUTHORIZATION FROM THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA, WHICH HAS BROAD POWER UNDER THE PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS ACT 2007 TO REGULATE THE

MEMBERSHIP AND OPERATIONS OF CARD NETWORKS. IN INDONESIA, BANK REGULATIONS REQUIRE PARTICIPANTS IN A CARD PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT BUSINESS TO OBTAIN A LICENSE AND ESTABLISH A LOCAL LEGAL ENTITY. REQUIREMENTS TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS LOCALLY HAVE BEEN

PROPOSED IN THAILAND AND INTRODUCED IN TAIWAN. THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF OFFICIAL REGULATORY POLICY UNDER THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR

REVENUES AND EXTEND OUR GLOBAL NETWORK.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL ADEQUACY UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BELOW.

CHARGE CARDS

OUR CHARGE CARDS, WHICH GENERALLY CARRY NO

PRESET SPENDING LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES. CHARGES ARE APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A CARDMEMBERS CURRENT SPENDING PATTERNS, PAYMENT

HISTORY, CREDIT RECORD AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. CARDMEMBERS GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS,

MAY BE CANCELLED. THE NO-PRESET SPENDING LIMIT AND PAY-IN-FULL NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS ATTRACT HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS.

THE CHARGE CARDS ALSO OFFER SEVERAL WAYS FOR ELIGIBLE U.S. CARDMEMBERS TO PAY OFF CERTAIN OF THEIR PURCHASES OVER TIME. THE SIGN & TRAVEL

®

FEATURE PERMITS ELIGIBLE U.S. CARDMEMBERS TO EXTEND PAYMENT FOR AIRLINE TICKETS, CRUISE SHIP TICKETS AND OTHER TRAVEL ITEMS PURCHASED WITH OUR CHARGE CARDS. THE

EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION PROVIDES ELIGIBLE U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE ABILITY TO EXTEND PAYMENT FOR ELIGIBLE CHARGES ABOVE A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CO-BRAND CARDS

WE ISSUE CARDS UNDER CO-BRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPETITION AMONG CARD ISSUERS AND

NETWORKS FOR ATTRACTIVE CO-BRAND CARD PARTNERSHIPS IS QUITE INTENSE BECAUSE THESE PARTNERSHIPS CAN GENERATE HIGH-SPENDING LOYAL CARDHOLDERS. THE DURATION OF OUR CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM FOUR TO TEN YEARS. CARDMEMBERS EARN REWARDS

PROVIDED BY THE PARTNERS RESPECTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR SPENDING ON THE CO-BRAND CARDS, SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY POINTS AND CASH BACK. WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR CO-BRAND PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED

PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. WE EXPENSE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MONTH

EARNED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. IN SOME CASES, THE PARTNER IS SOLELY LIABLE FOR PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE CO-BRAND PARTNERS OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM. AS THE ISSUER OF THE CO-BRAND CARD,

WE RETAIN ALL THE CREDIT RISK WITH THE CARDMEMBER AND BEAR THE RECEIVABLES FUNDING AND OPERATING EXPENSES FOR SUCH CARDS. THE CO-BRAND PARTNER RETAINS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE MILES POINTS, OR OTHER CURRENCY EARNED BY THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE

PARTNERS LOYALTY PROGRAM.

DURING 2012, WE LAUNCHED TWO NEW CO-BRANDED CARDS: THE MORGAN STANLEY

CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THE PLATINUM CARD

®

FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS EXCLUSIVELY FOR MORGAN STANLEY.

THE NEW CARDS OFFER EXCLUSIVE BENEFITS FOR MORGAN STANLEY CLIENTS WITH ELIGIBLE BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS.

CARD PRICING AND

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

ON CERTAIN CARDS WE CHARGE AN ANNUAL FEE THAT VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD AND THE NUMBER OF CARDS

FOR EACH ACCOUNT. WE ALSO OFFER MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS ON WHICH WE ASSESS FINANCE CHARGES FOR REVOLVING BALANCES. DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, WE MAY ALSO CHARGE CARDMEMBERS AN ANNUAL PROGRAM FEE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAMS

AND FEES FOR ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE (E.G., LATE FEES) OR FOR CERTAIN OPTIONAL SERVICES (E.G., TRAVEL INSURANCE). WE APPLY STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR CREDITWORTHINESS TO EACH CARDMEMBER THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS BOTH AT THE TIME OF INITIAL SOLICITATION

OR APPLICATION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING THE CARD RELATIONSHIP. WE USE SOPHISTICATED CREDIT MODELS AND TECHNIQUES IN OUR RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

®

PROGRAM

THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO EARN ONE POINT FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY DOLLAR

CHARGED ON ELIGIBLE, ENROLLED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND THEN REDEEM POINTS FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF REWARDS, INCLUDING TRAVEL, RETAIL MERCHANDISE, DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND EVEN DONATIONS TO BENEFIT CHARITIES. A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF OUR CARDS BY THEIR TERMS ALLOW CARDMEMBERS TO EARN BONUS POINTS FOR PURCHASES AT MERCHANTS IN PARTICULAR INDUSTRY CATEGORIES. POINTS GENERALLY HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF POINTS ONE CAN EARN. A LARGE

MAJORITY OF SPENDING BY ELIGIBLE CARDMEMBERS EARNS POINTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

THE U.S. MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM HAS OVER 150 REDEMPTION PARTNERS AND ACCESS TO THOUSANDS OF MERCHANDISE BRANDS. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS ARE ALIGNED WITH SPECIFIC CARD PRODUCTS TO BETTER MEET CARDMEMBER LIFESTYLE AND REWARD PROGRAM USAGE NEEDS. AMERICAN

EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THREE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS BASED ON THE CREDIT OR CHARGE CARD THEY HAVE IN THEIR WALLET. FOR THOSE CARDMEMBERS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND BLUE FOR

BUSINESS, WE HAVE THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPRESS

®

PROGRAM. AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARDMEMBERS WITH AMERICAN

EXPRESS GREEN AND GOLD CARDS HAVE THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. PLATINUM CARD

®

MEMBERS AND CENTURION

®

CARDMEMBERS ARE ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS FIRST

WE BELIEVE OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

POINT BANK IS A SUBSTANTIAL ASSET AND A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS AS A VIRTUAL CURRENCY. FOR EXAMPLE, CARDMEMBERS INCREASINGLY USE OUR PAY WITH POINTS PROGRAM INCLUDING TO MAKE PURCHASES AT AMAZON.COM AND FOR

AIRLINE TICKETS AND OTHER TRAVEL CATEGORIES, AS WELL AS TO PAY FOR THEIR ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE.

DURING 2012, WE LAUNCHED A

NUMBER OF NEW REDEMPTION PARTNERSHIPS, INCLUDING A NEW POINTS TRANSFER PARTNERSHIP WITH ASIA MILES, THROUGH WHICH CARDMEMBERS CAN REDEEM FOR FLIGHT AWARDS ON 21 AIRLINES, INCLUDING CATHAY PACIFIC AIRWAYS, AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A NEW REWARDS PARTNERSHIP WITH ONE KINGS LANE, ALLOWING CARDMEMBERS TO REDEEM THEIR POINTS FOR GIFT CARDS TO PURCHASE FURNITURE, ACCESSORIES, GIFTS AND OTHER ITEMS FOR THE HOME ON THE DAILY DEAL

SITE. ADDITIONALLY, WE BROADENED OUR FACEBOOK REWARDS PARTNERSHIP, ALLOWING CARDMEMBERS TO REDEEM THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF FACEBOOK GAMING APPLICATIONS. WE ALSO LAUNCHED MOBILE GIFT CARDS, WHICH ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO

USE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS FOR MOBILE PHONE-ENABLED GIFT CARDS OF SELECT RETAILERS AND USE THEM INSTANTLY VIA SMARTPHONE AT THE POINT-OF-SALE.

WHEN A CARDMEMBER ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM USES THE CARD, WE ESTABLISH RESERVES TO COVER THE COST OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REWARD REDEMPTIONS FOR POINTS EARNED TO DATE. WHEN A MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM ENROLLEE REDEEMS A REWARD USING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS, WE MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM PARTNER PROVIDING THE REWARD PURSUANT TO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE IS DRIVEN BY CARDMEMBER

CHARGE VOLUME, CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH REDEMPTION PARTNERS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

EXPENSE APPEARING ON PAGE 18 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND LOYALTY. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS PROGRAMS YIELD HIGHER SPEND, STRONGER

CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND GREATER PROFIT FOR US. BY OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES, WE HAVE GIVEN OUR CARDMEMBERS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THEIR REWARDS POINTS AND FAVORABLY AFFECTED OUR AVERAGE COST PER POINT. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK

TO OPTIMIZE THE OVERALL ECONOMICS OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS AND TO MERCHANTS. OUR PROGRAM IS ALSO VALUABLE TO MERCHANTS THAT BECOME REDEMPTION PARTNERS AS WE BRING THEM HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS AND NEW

MARKETING CHANNELS TO REACH THESE CARDMEMBERS.

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS  COMPETITION

OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. AS A CARD ISSUER, WE COMPETE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT

ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS (SUCH AS BANK OF AMERICA, CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL, CITIBANK AND JPMORGAN CHASE) AND DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHICH ISSUES THE DISCOVER CARD ON THE DISCOVER NETWORK. WE ALSO ENCOUNTER

COMPETITION FROM BUSINESSES THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ONLY AT LIMITED LOCATIONS. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE FACED

INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR, AS COMPETITORS HAVE TARGETED OPENS CUSTOMER BASE AND OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO SMALL BUSINESSES.

THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH

THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS. COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT CARDHOLDERS, INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT, AIRLINE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS, CASH REBATES AND

OTHER REWARD OR REBATE PROGRAMS, SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, TEASER PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CREDIT CARD ACQUISITION AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND CO-BRANDED ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS.

MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ALSO ISSUE DEBIT CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR

FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL-PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE VISA OR MASTERCARD LOGO. DEBIT CARDS WERE HISTORICALLY MARKETED AS

REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH AND CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN FOR SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS. HOWEVER, DEBIT CARDS ARE INCREASINGLY PERCEIVED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CREDIT OR CHARGE CARDS AND USED IN THAT MANNER.

ADDITIONALLY, OVERDRAFT ACCOUNTS CAN BE USED BY OUR COMPETITORS TO EXTEND CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS WHEN TRANSACTION VALUES EXCEED MONIES AVAILABLE IN A LINKED DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT.

AS THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE ARE ALSO FACING INCREASING COMPETITION FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS, SUCH AS ONLINE

NETWORKS, TELECOM PROVIDERS AND SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE PROVIDERS, THAT LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CUSTOMERS EXISTING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS AND BANK RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT OR OTHER FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE

EVOLUTION OF PAYMENT PRODUCTS IN EMERGING MARKETS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPED MARKETS. INSTEAD OF MIGRATING FROM CASH TO CHECKS TO PLASTIC, TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER BEHAVIORS IN THESE MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE SKIPPING OF ONE OR

MORE STEPS TO ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS SUCH AS MOBILE PAYMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE EVOLVING COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, SEE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  COMPETITION UNDER

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES ABOVE AND ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP  ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS  COMPETITION UNDER CORPORATE & OTHER BELOW.

FINANCING OF RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE SALE OF MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB FINANCE THEIR REVOLVING CREDIT RECEIVABLES AND CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES, IN PART, THROUGH THE SALE OF

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND BY ACCEPTING CONSUMER DEPOSITS IN THE UNITED STATES. TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ALSO FUND RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS. THE COST OF FUNDING CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR EXPENSE OF CARD

OPERATIONS.

THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF OUR SECURITIZATION AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 31-35 UNDER THE CAPTION

DEPOSIT PROGRAMS

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS, AND AEBFSB ACCEPTS

DEPOSITS DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL SAVINGS, A SET OF DEPOSIT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING HIGH-YIELD SAVINGS AND CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $39.7 BILLION IN TOTAL U.S.

RETAIL DEPOSITS. OUR DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES COMPETE WITH THOSE OF OTHER DEPOSIT-TAKING ORGANIZATIONS THAT SOURCE DEPOSITS THROUGH TELEPHONE, INTERNET AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DELIVERY CHANNELS, BROKERAGE NETWORKS AND/OR BRANCH LOCATIONS. WE COMPETE

PRIMARILY IN THE DEPOSIT SECTOR ON THE BASIS OF RATES AND OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS IS

DEPENDENT ON THE CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT (FDIA) GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON

ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS (1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A

WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. A BANK THAT IS LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE

FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA. AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION

BY THE FDIC. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT SOLICIT DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN

THE MARKET AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER,

ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT THE INSTITUTION IS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS

ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED,

OR REQUIRE AN UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS, ALL OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE INSTITUTIONS ABILITY TO ACCEPT BROKERED DEPOSITS.

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS AND DEPOSIT PROGRAMS  REGULATION

OUR CHARGE CARD, CONSUMER LENDING AND DEPOSIT OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION. IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A

NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND

INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS GOVERN THE COLLECTION, USE, SHARING AND SAFEGUARDING OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION. OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, INCLUDING

THOSE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, ALSO HAVE CERTAIN APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS THAT GOVERN THE COLLECTION, USE, SHARING AND SAFEGUARDING OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, IN SOME CASES MORE

STRINGENT THAN THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. U.S. FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF U.S. STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE

SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION AND DISCLOSURE LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES). BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS AFFECT US TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS RESULT IN AMOUNTS OWED BEING CLASSIFIED AS

DELINQUENT AND/OR CHARGED OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE. AS STATED ABOVE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE

AML PROGRAMS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION THAT IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BELOW.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, AND OUR OTHER BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THEREOF COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE. WE

REGULARLY REVIEW AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REFINE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS.

THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND ROBUST, AND

SUPERVISORY EFFORTS TO APPLY RELEVANT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES HAVE BECOME MORE INTENSE. THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THIS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY IS UNCERTAIN, BUT INTERNAL AND REGULATORY REVIEWS HAVE RESULTED IN, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT

IN, CHANGES TO PRICING, PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES. SUCH REVIEWS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION, ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION TO CARDMEMBERS AND MAY RESULT IN

ADDITIONAL REGULATORY ACTIONS WHICH COULD INCLUDE CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES. IN JULY 2012, THE CFPB ISSUED AN INDUSTRY BULLETIN REGARDING ITS REVIEW OF MARKETING PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO CREDIT CARD ADD-ON PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DEBT CANCELLATION,

IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION, CREDIT REPORTING AND MONITORING, AND OTHER SUPPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS. WE ARE COOPERATING WITH REGULATORS IN THEIR ONGOING REGULATORY EXAMINATIONS OF CREDIT CARD ADD-ON PRODUCTS. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ONGOING REVIEWS BY

SEVERAL BANK REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE CFPB, RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS U.S. CONSUMER CARD PRACTICES, SEE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT OF 2010 WITHIN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BELOW.

IN AUGUST 2010, AEBFSB ENTERED INTO A PUBLIC, WRITTEN SUPERVISORY AGREEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION (OTS),

WHICH WAS THEN ITS PRIMARY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR, REQUIRING AEBFSB TO MAKE CERTAIN ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND TO COMPLETE CERTAIN CORRECTIVE ACTIONS RELATING TO COMPLIANCE. THIS SUPERVISORY AGREEMENT CONTINUES TO REMAIN IN EFFECT

FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER OF SUPERVISION OF AEBFSB FROM THE OTS TO THE OCC. IN OCTOBER 2012, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE REACHED SETTLEMENTS WITH SEVERAL BANK REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, FDIC, OCC, UDFI AND CFPB, TO RESOLVE REVIEWS OF CERTAIN

ASPECTS OF OUR U.S. CONSUMER CARD PRACTICES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS. SIMILAR SETTLEMENTS WERE REACHED WITH SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB AND TRS. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

ENTITIES AGREED TO PAY CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES TOTALING $27.5 MILLION, AND WE, THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES, ESTABLISHED A RESTRICTED FUND POOL TOTALING $85 MILLION FOR CUSTOMER REFUNDS (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT DEPENDING ON THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF THE

REFUNDS). THE MAJORITY OF THOSE REFUNDS IS RELATED TO DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES AND LATE FEE CHARGES. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE SETTLEMENTS REACHED IN OCTOBER 2012, SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL, AN INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL

ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED GUIDANCE TO THE INDUSTRY ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES (THE GUIDANCE). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE AREAS: (1) CREDIT LINE

MANAGEMENT; (2) OVER-LIMIT PRACTICES; (3) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION PRACTICES; (4) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES; AND (5) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES. CENTURION BANK AND

AEBFSB EVALUATE AND DISCUSS THE GUIDANCE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS PART OF THEIR REGULATORY EXAMINATION PROCESSES, AND, AS A RESULT, MAY REFINE THEIR PRACTICES FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON REGULATORY INPUT. THE GUIDANCE

HAS NOT HAD, NOR DO WE EXPECT IT TO HAVE, ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES.

INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARD  REGULATION

AS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, REGULATORS CONTINUED TO PROPOSE AND ENACT A VARIETY OF NEW REGULATORY CHANGES TO THE PAYMENTS

INDUSTRY DURING THE COURSE OF 2012.

IN EUROPE, THE EU CONTINUED IN ITS EFFORTS TO WORK TOWARDS GREATER HARMONIZATION ON A

NUMBER OF FRONTS, IN PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO PAYMENTS, THE AML REGIME AND DATA PROTECTION. THE EU CONTINUES TO SPONSOR INITIATIVES IN RELATION TO THE CROSS BORDER ISSUING OF CREDIT, RECURRING TRANSACTIONS AND THE MERGER OF THE PSD AND THE E-MONEY

DIRECTIVE. THESE PAN-EUROPEAN INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN SUPPLEMENTED BY A BROAD RANGE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION AND TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVES AT AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATE LEVEL.

IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE EUROPE, WE HAVE SEEN REGULATORS INITIATE NEW REGULATIONS IN RELATION TO A NUMBER OF KEY THEMES, PARTICULARLY RESPONSIBLE LENDING (SUCH AS CANADA, NEW ZEALAND AND SINGAPORE), PRIVACY

AND DATA PROTECTION (SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, CANADA, MEXICO AND SINGAPORE) AND FINANCIAL CRIME.

REGULATORS IN A NUMBER OF

COUNTRIES ARE SHIFTING THEIR FOCUS FROM JUST ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RULES AND REGULATIONS TOWARDS PAYING GREATER ATTENTION TO THE PRODUCT DESIGN AND OPERATION WITH A FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS AND OUTCOMES. REGULATORS EXPECTATIONS OF FIRMS IN

RELATION TO THEIR COMPLIANCE, RISK AND CONTROL FRAMEWORKS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND REGULATORS ARE PLACING SIGNIFICANT EMPHASIS ON A FIRMS SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS RELATING TO THE IDENTIFICATION AND RESOLUTION OF ISSUES.

WE EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE IN 2013. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS PLANNING IN LIGHT OF CHANGING MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND

EXPERIENCED INCREASING COMPETITION INCLUDING INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION, AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION INTO NEW AND EMERGING SEGMENTS, EFFORTS TO TRANSITION B2B SPEND FROM CASH AND CHECK TO CARDS AND ELECTRONIC INVOICING AND PAYMENT VEHICLES, AND INCREASING

SUPPORT FROM THE NETWORKS IN THE SALES PROCESS. BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CARD ISSUERS SUCH AS CITIBANK, JPMORGAN CHASE AND U.S. BANK TO BUILD AND SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING NECESSARY TO SATISFY CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS.

AT THE PAYMENT PROVIDER LEVEL, WE ARE SEEING INCREASED COMPETITION, PARTICULARLY FOR MID-SIZED COMPANIES, FROM BOTH REGIONAL

BANKS AND NATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS BANK OF AMERICA AND JPMORGAN CHASE. PAYMENT PROVIDERS HAVE EXPANDED GLOBAL ISSUANCE FOOTPRINTS AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIOS BY FORMING PARTNERSHIPS AND IMPROVING PROPRIETARY CAPABILITIES. GLOBAL SERVICING, DATA QUALITY,

TECHNOLOGICAL FUNCTIONALITY AND SIMPLICITY, CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, AND PRICE AND OTHER FINANCIAL TERMS ARE AMONG THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE CORPORATE PAYMENTS BUSINESS.

GLOBAL CORPORATE PAYMENTS  REGULATION

THE GCP

BUSINESS, WHICH ENGAGES IN THE EXTENSION OF COMMERCIAL CREDIT, IS SUBJECT TO MORE LIMITED REGULATION THAN OUR CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS. IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS APPLICABLE TO OUR CONSUMER LENDING

BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT, THE FCRA (AS AMENDED BY THE FACT ACT), AS WELL AS LAWS THAT GENERALLY PROHIBIT ENGAGING IN UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS OR BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN STATE LAWS THAT

REGULATE FEES AND CHARGES ON OUR PRODUCTS. IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS, INCLUDING CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO BREACH NOTIFICATION. OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE

OPERATE, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, ALSO HAVE CERTAIN APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS, IN SOME CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO BANKRUPTCY AND

DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS THAT CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWED TO US. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ALONG WITH

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE REST OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAMS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS

LEGISLATION AND ITS EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BELOW. IN SOME COUNTRIES, REGULATION OF CARD PRACTICES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION MAY APPLY TO SOME CORPORATE PAYMENTS RELATIONSHIPS.

GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL

AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL (GBT) PROVIDES GLOBALLY INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS, BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE, AS WELL AS THROUGH MOBILE APPLICATIONS, TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS MANAGE AND OPTIMIZE

THEIR TRAVEL EXPENSES AND SERVICE THEIR TRAVELING EMPLOYEES. GBT SEEKS TO PROVIDE OUR CLIENTS WITH DEPENDABILITY, DEEP INSIGHT AND A COMPREHENSIVE NETWORK. WITH CLIENTS RANGING FROM SMALL BUSINESSES TO MULTINATIONAL AND GLOBAL CORPORATIONS, WE

PROVIDE: TRAVEL RESERVATION ADVICE AND TRANSACTION PROCESSING THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK THAT IS AVAILABLE 24 HOURS PER DAY; PREFERRED PARTNERSHIPS WITH AIRLINE, HOTEL, CAR AND LIMOUSINE COMPANIES; TRAVEL EXPENSE MANAGEMENT POLICY

CONSULTATION; MEETING MANAGEMENT, SUPPLIER NEGOTIATION AND CONSULTATION; ADVISORY SERVICES, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION REPORTING, BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE, DATA ANALYSIS, RESEARCH AND BENCHMARKING; GROUP AND INCENTIVE TRAVEL SERVICES; POLICY CONTROL

ADVICE; AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS THAT HELP TRAVELERS BE MORE EFFICIENT WHEN TRAVELING FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.

WE CONTINUE TO

EVALUATE OUR ECONOMIC MODEL AND INVEST IN NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE THE VALUE THAT WE DELIVER TO OUR CLIENTS AND ADDRESS ONGOING TRAVEL INDUSTRY CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED OUR

RELIANCE ON COMMISSION REVENUES FROM SUPPLIERS (SUCH AS AIRLINES OR HOTELS) AND NOW GENERATE MORE REVENUES FROM CLIENTS WHO PAY FOR THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ADJUSTED OUR EXPENSE BASE TO REFLECT THE SHIFT OF CLIENT

PREFERENCES FOR SOME TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS FROM HIGH-TOUCH PERSONAL SERVICE TO AUTOMATED SERVICING.

WE

LAUNCHED SEVERAL NEW PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT OUR CORPORATE CLIENTS IN 2012. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ENHANCED OUR HOTEL OFFERING BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RATES AND INCLUDING ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES THAT DO NOT LOAD CONTENT IN VARIOUS TRAVEL BOOKING ENGINES. WE ALSO

MADE ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR MOBILE TRAVEL SOLUTION, MOBILEXTEND

®

, INCLUDING PLATFORM UPGRADES AND THE LAUNCH OF AX

CONNECT LOCATION & COMMUNICATION, WHICH HELPS TRAVEL MANAGERS LOCATE AND PROVIDE A LEVEL OF CARE TO TRAVELERS IN THE CASE OF TRAVEL EMERGENCIES OR DISRUPTION.

GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL  COMPETITION

GBT

CONTINUES TO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FROM NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES, OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS AND NEW ENTRANTS. COMPETITION AMONG

TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE, VALUE CREATION, CONVENIENCE, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER. COMPETITION ALSO COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES, AS SOME COMPANIES HAVE BECOME ACCREDITED AS

IN-HOUSE CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS. NEW ENTRANTS COULD ALSO REPRESENT ADDITIONAL COMPETITION ALONG THE END-TO-END TRAVEL VALUE CHAIN, WHICH COULD IMPACT COMPETITION IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM.

FOR MANY YEARS, TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES HAVE FACED PRESSURE ON REVENUES FROM AIRLINES, AS MOST CARRIERS HAVE STOPPED PAYING

BASE COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OTHER FORMS OF TRAVEL AGENT COMPENSATION. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO MADE EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THEY BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR WEB SITES AND

OTHER MEANS. THESE TRENDS HAVE REDUCED THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT RECEIVE DISTRIBUTION REVENUE FROM DIRECTLY BOOKED TRANSACTIONS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES,

RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS INCLUDING EXPANDED GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES. THIS IMMUNITY ENABLES AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT

VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS. THESE TYPES OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THESE ISSUES, SEE RISK FACTORS BELOW.

OVERALL, INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, THE ONGOING TRENDS OF INCREASING DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES, THE RISE OF

LOW-COST CARRIERS, ONGOING REDUCTIONS IN OR ELIMINATION OF AIRLINE COMMISSIONS AND FEES AND THE SHIFT OF CUSTOMER PREFERENCES TO ONLINE CHANNELS AND AUTOMATED SERVICING TOOLS, CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY FOR TRAVEL

AGENCIES.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE TRAVEL BUSINESS IS BROAD WITH MUCH OVERLAP BETWEEN CONSUMER AND BUSINESS TRAVEL. SEE

AMERICAN EXPRESS U.S. CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK  COMPETITION UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES ABOVE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE TRAVEL BUSINESS.

CORPORATE & OTHER

CORPORATE & OTHER CONSISTS OF CORPORATE FUNCTIONS AND AUXILIARY BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ENTERPRISE GROWTH

GROUP, THE COMPANYS PUBLISHING BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY OPERATIONS. WE ALSO DISCUSS INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE IN THIS SECTION.

AS DISCUSSED IN CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY ON PAGE 29 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, OUR CORPORATE LIQUIDITY OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO CASH,

READILY-MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CONTINGENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, SUCH THAT WE CAN CONTINUOUSLY MEET EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCING OBLIGATIONS AND BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST A TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD. A LARGE PORTION OF THE INTEREST EXPENSE IN

CORPORATE & OTHER INCLUDES THE INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO MAINTAINING THIS LIQUIDITY POOL SINCE ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES BENEFIT FROM THE LIQUIDITY, AS WELL AS INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO OTHER CORPORATE INDEBTEDNESS.

ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP

THE ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP WAS ESTABLISHED TO PURSUE NEW FORMS OF PAYMENTS AND DIGITAL COMMERCE THAT OPEN AMERICAN EXPRESS TO NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENTS, NEW GEOGRAPHIES ACROSS THE WORLD, AND NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. SPECIFICALLY, THIS INCLUDES ESTABLISHING A DIGITAL SERVICES PLATFORM FOR THE COMPANY, EXPANDING ALTERNATIVE MOBILE AND ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICES, GROWING OUR PREPAID PRODUCTS, FORMING NEW PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW REVENUE STREAMS BEYOND

THE TRADITIONAL CARD AND TRAVEL BUSINESSES. ENTERPRISE GROWTH SEEKS TO OPTIMIZE OUR ASSETS AND CAPABILITIES AND BUILD OR ACQUIRE THE TALENT, BUSINESSES AND PLATFORMS REQUIRED TO DELIVER NEW FORMS OF GROWTH IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. THE GROUP CONSISTS

OF THREE CORE BUSINESS UNITS: ONLINE AND MOBILE WHICH INCLUDES SERVE VIRTUAL ENTERPRISES, INC. OR SERVE (FORMERLY KNOWN AS REVOLUTION MONEY), FEE BASED SERVICES AND GLOBAL PAYMENT OPTIONS. THE GROUP ALSO INCLUDES THE CORPORATE

DEVELOPMENT FUNCTION (THE COMPANYS MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS GROUP).

ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS

THE ONLINE AND MOBILE BUSINESS UNIT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING NEXT GENERATION PAYMENT CAPABILITIES AND

ASSOCIATED SERVICES THAT CAN EXPAND THE ROLE WE PLAY IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. SINCE LAUNCHING SERVE, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO DEVELOP CAPABILITIES ON THE PLATFORM TO SUPPORT FUTURE DIGITAL INITIATIVES AND TO ALLOW US TO DELIVER MORE ALTERNATIVE

PAYMENT OPTIONS. SERVE

®

IS AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES AS A DIGITAL SOFTWARE-BASED PLATFORM WHERE CONSUMERS

CAN SPEND, SEND AND RECEIVE MONEY, AND MAKE PERSON-TO-PERSON PAYMENTS ONLINE AT SERVE.COM, VIA MOBILE PHONES AND MAKE PURCHASES VIA THE SERVE CARD AT MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. SERVE UNIFIES MULTIPLE PAYMENT OPTIONS INTO A SINGLE

ACCOUNT THAT CAN BE FUNDED WITH CASH VIA A GREEN DOT MONEYPAK, FROM A BANK ACCOUNT, DEBIT, CREDIT OR CHARGE CARD, OR BY RECEIVING MONEY FROM ANOTHER SERVE ACCOUNT. IN 2012, WE LAUNCHED SERVE DEALS & OFFERS, WHICH ALLOWS SERVE CUSTOMERS TO

GET DISCOUNTS ON LOCAL OFFERINGS BASED ON THEIR COMMUNICATED INTERESTS.

IN ADDITION TO DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DISTRIBUTION

ACTIVITIES THROUGH THE ONLINE CHANNEL, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS IN THE MOBILE, E-COMMERCE, NOT-FOR-PROFIT AND GAMING SPACE TO BUILD CAPABILITIES AND DRIVE ADOPTION OF THE SERVE PLATFORM. WE ARE FOCUSED ON WORKING WITH PARTNERS THAT

HAVE LARGE CUSTOMER BASES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM EMBEDDING

SERVE DIRECTLY INTO THEIR PAYMENT PATH AND ROLLING OUT EASY-TO-USE DIGITAL PAYMENT SOLUTIONS FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2012 WE PARTNERED WITH ZYNGA TO LAUNCH ZYNGA SERVE

REWARDS, A NEW PROGRAM THAT OFFERS IN-GAME INCENTIVES FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. WE ALSO DEVELOPED A FACEBOOK APP THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SEND AND REQUEST MONEY WITHIN A WALL POST IN FACEBOOK.

THE TEAM IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE IN EMERGING MARKETS. WE CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY MARKET STRATEGIES THAT INCLUDE

INTRODUCING NEW PAYMENT FORMS OUTSIDE OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, EMBRACING NEW ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES, AND FORMULATING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS TO GENERATE NEW, INTERNATIONAL REVENUE STREAMS. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT

OF OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LIANLIAN GROUP, THE MOBILE TOP-UP COMPANY HAS LEVERAGED THE SERVE PLATFORM IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROCESSING OF CERTAIN TOP-UP TRANSACTIONS IN THREE PROVINCES IN CHINA AS OF THE END OF 2012.

ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS  COMPETITION

THE ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS SECTOR IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COMPETITORS THAT OFFER OR ARE DEVELOPING PAYMENT SYSTEMS IN E-COMMERCE AND ACROSS MOBILE DEVICES, AND

WITH FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS IN RESPONSE TO EVOLVING CONSUMER HABITS AND MERCHANT NEEDS. THESE COMPETITORS INCLUDE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CREDIT CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS, AND INCREASINGLY ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROVIDERS,

SUCH AS PAYPAL, GOOGLE WALLET AND SQUARE, AS WELL AS OTHER NON-TRADITIONAL INDUSTRY PLAYERS, SUCH AS MOBILE OPERATORS, HANDSET MANUFACTURERS, TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, RETAILERS AND OTHER START-UPS AND NEW ENTRANTS TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. PARTNERSHIPS

ARE ALSO BEING FORMED AMONG VARIOUS COMPETITORS, SUCH AS PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN PAYPAL AND DISCOVER AND BETWEEN SQUARE AND STARBUCKS. AMONG OTHER SERVICES, THESE COMPETITORS PROVIDE OR ARE SEEKING TO DEVELOP DIGITAL PAYMENT CAPABILITIES THAT CAN BE

USED TO BUY AND SELL GOODS ONLINE, ALTERNATIVE POINT-OF-SALE SYSTEMS THAT ENABLE DIGITAL PAYMENTS AT THE PHYSICAL POINT OF SALE, AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT PAYMENTS TO AND FROM DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS OR PROPRIETARY ACCOUNTS FOR DIGITAL, MOBILE COMMERCE AND

OTHER APPLICATIONS. A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS RELY PRINCIPALLY ON THE INTERNET AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORKS TO SUPPORT THEIR SERVICES, AND MAY ENJOY LOWER COSTS THAN WE DO. OTHER COMPETITORS WORKING TO DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT

SERVICES MAY HAVE AND MAY DEPLOY SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER CASH RESERVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE OR MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF SERVICES AND CAPABILITIES THAN WE OFFER. CONSUMER AND MERCHANT ADOPTION IS A KEY COMPETITIVE FACTOR AND OUR

COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP PLATFORMS OR TECHNOLOGIES THAT BECOME MORE WIDELY ADOPTED THAN OURS. MICRO-PAYMENTS ON SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL TODAY BUT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GROW RAPIDLY, REPRESENTING THE POSSIBILITY FOR COMPETITION FROM A NEW

PAYMENT FORM. COMPETITION WILL REMAIN FIERCE AS PAYMENT SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE.

FEE BASED SERVICES

THE FEE BASED SERVICES TEAM WITHIN ENTERPRISE GROWTH IS TASKED WITH CREATING AND MANAGING BUSINESSES

THAT CAN GENERATE NEW, NON-CARD PAYMENT AND E-COMMERCE REVENUE STREAMS BY CAPITALIZING ON THE EXISTING ASSETS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS. THE FEE BASED SERVICES TEAM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPORTING OUR LOYALTYEDGE

®

OFFERING, A PRIVATE-LABELED LOYALTY SOLUTION THAT HELPS COMPANIES LIKE DELTA AIR LINES AND FEDEX DESIGN, IMPLEMENT

AND MANAGE CUSTOMIZED POINTS-BASED LOYALTY PROGRAMS TO ENGAGE AND RETAIN THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE TEAM ALSO SUPPORTS THE ONLINE RETAIL SITE, VENTE-PRIVEE USA LLC, A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN AMERICAN EXPRESS AND VENTE-PRIVEE.COM, EUROPES LEADER IN

ONLINE PRIVATE SALES OF LUXURY GOODS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES IS PART OF THE FEE BASED SERVICES ORGANIZATION AND CONSISTS

OF RETAIL AND WHOLESALE FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES AND THE FX INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS OPERATION. OUR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESS IS CONCENTRATED PRIMARILY IN KEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS, INCLUDING MULTIPLE AIRPORT LOCATIONS IN EUROPE (LONDON

HEATHROW, EDINBURGH, MADRID, VIENNA, GENEVA AND NICE). THIS AIRPORT-BASED RETAIL BUSINESS IS SUPPLEMENTED IN AUSTRALIA AND SINGAPORE WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE OFFICES IN CITY LOCATIONS AND THROUGH SELECTED PARTNER LOCATIONS SERVING RETAIL CUSTOMERS IN

THOSE COUNTRIES. IN 2012, WE ANNOUNCED THE EXPANSION OF OUR AIRPORT PORTFOLIO TO INCLUDE BIRMINGHAM (U.K.), COPENHAGEN AND ROME INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS. OUR ONLINE FX INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS SERVICE ENABLES COMPANIES, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND, IN

THE CASE OF AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, CONSUMERS TO MAKE CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY.

GLOBAL PAYMENT OPTIONS

GLOBAL

PAYMENT OPTIONS (GPO) OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF PREPAID PAYMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BOTH RELOADABLE AND NON-RELOADABLE PREPAID PAYMENT PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, GPO OFFERS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

AND OUR OTHER GENERAL PURPOSE RELOADABLE PREPAID CARDS, WE HOPE TO SERVE NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENTS THAT DO NOT RELY ON TRADITIONAL CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR DEBIT AND CHECKING PRODUCTS TO MANAGE DAY-TO-DAY FINANCES. WE ALSO LAUNCHED A GIFT CARD IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM (ISSUED THROUGH OUR E-MONEY LICENSED ENTITY, AMERICAN EXPRESS ADVANCED SERVICES EUROPE LTD.).

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF ISSUING AND SELLING TRAVELERS CHEQUES SINCE 1891. WE SELL THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

TRAVELERS CHEQUE (TRAVELERS CHEQUE OR CHEQUE) AS A SAFE AND CONVENIENT ALTERNATIVE TO CASH. TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN

U.S. DOLLARS AND SEVEN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE ALSO ISSUE AND SELL OTHER FORMS OF PAPER TRAVELERS CHEQUES, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

GIFT CHEQUES (GIFT CHEQUES), WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN U.S. AND CANADIAN DOLLARS. SALES OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND NET INTEREST INCOME FROM THE TRAVELERS

CHEQUE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN 2012. WE ALSO ISSUE GENERAL PURPOSE RELOADABLE PREPAID TRAVEL CARDS IN DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA AND CHINA.

WE SELL AMERICAN EXPRESS PREPAID PRODUCTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS GLOBALLY, INCLUDING SALES DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS VIA THE INTERNET.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE PREPAID SECTOR VARY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PRODUCT, BUT SOME ARE.



NUMBER AND LOCATION OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE FORM OF PAYMENT



AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER OF OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT



AMOUNT OF FEES CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER

GLOBAL PAYMENT OPTIONS  REGULATION

AS AN ISSUER OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS, WE ARE REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE MONEY TRANSMITTER OR SALE OF CHECK LAWS IN EFFECT IN MOST STATES. THESE LAWS

REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHECK (AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, PREPAID CARD) ISSUERS TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN HIGHLY RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. WE INVEST THE PROCEEDS

FROM SALES OF OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW, PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY RATED DEBT SECURITIES CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS. MANY STATES EXAMINE

LICENSEES ANNUALLY.

IN ADDITION, THE BANK SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

REGISTRATION OF TRAVELERS CHECK ISSUERS AND THE PROVIDERS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES AS MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE AML RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED IN

2011, REQUIRES THAT WE MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAM FOR PREPAID ACCESS PRODUCTS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE VARYING LICENSING AND AML REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.

TRAVELERS CHECK AND PREPAID CARD ISSUERS ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAWS OF MANY STATES TO COMPLY WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY

LAWS, UNDER WHICH SUCH ISSUERS MUST PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY TRAVELERS CHECK OR PREPAID CARD

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PRODUCT. IN RECENT YEARS, A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION ESTABLISHING SHORTER PERIODS FOR TRAVELERS

CHECKS AND/OR PREPAID CARDS, OFTEN WITH RETROACTIVE APPLICATION. WE HAVE CHALLENGED, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE, WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE SIGNIFICANT DEFECTS IN THESE LAWS, WHICH CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID

CARDS BUSINESS IN THE STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE ENACTED.

WE CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY CONCERNING ANY OF

OUR GPO PREPAID OFFERINGS. IN CERTAIN STATES WHERE REGULATION CONTINUES TO RESTRICT FEES AND HAS MADE IT UNPROFITABLE FOR US TO OFFER PREPAID CARDS, WE HAVE EITHER LIMITED OR WITHDRAWN FROM SELLING IN THESE STATES.

WORLD SERVICE

OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED UNDER WORLD SERVICE. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE

UNITS HAVE WORKED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS TO ENSURE OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IMPROVING OPERATING MARGINS. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES RELEASED ITS ANNUAL NATIONWIDE CREDIT CARD SATISFACTION STUDY

AND RANKED AMERICAN EXPRESS HIGHEST IN OVERALL SATISFACTION AMONG 10 OF THE LARGEST CARD ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SIXTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR.

GLOBAL BUSINESS SERVICES

CARDMEMBER INFORMATION, THE ADDITION OF NEW CARDS TO AN ACCOUNT AND RESOLVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ISSUES. IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE ARE ENHANCING OUR GLOBAL PLATFORMS AND CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS IN REVOLVING CREDIT.

WE CONTINUE TO DEVOTE RESOURCES TO OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF DATA INTEGRITY, INFORMATION SECURITY, DATA

PROTECTION AND PRIVACY. OUR INTERNAL IT ORGANIZATION RETAINS OUR KEY TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCIES, SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND INFORMATION SECURITY, WHILE OUTSOURCING MOST OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT AND APPLICATION

DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. THIS ENABLES US TO BENEFIT FROM THIRD-PARTY EXPERTISE AND LOWER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS PER TRANSACTION. WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE

WITH OUR INTERNAL POLICIES AND APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS, AS DESCRIBED UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION BELOW.

WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE ONLINE CHANNELS TO LOWER COSTS, IMPROVE SERVICE QUALITY AND ENHANCE OUR BUSINESS MODEL. AS OF THE END OF 2012,

CUSTOMERS HAD ENROLLED APPROXIMATELY 30 MILLION CARDS GLOBALLY IN OUR ONLINE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY KNOWN AS THE MANAGE YOUR CARD ACCOUNT SERVICE. THIS SERVICE ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO REVIEW ALL OF THEIR CARD TRANSACTIONS

TWITTER, WHICH PROVIDE US WITH ANOTHER CHANNEL TO COMMUNICATE AND INTERACT WITH OUR CARDMEMBERS.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

OVERVIEW

FEDERAL AND STATE BANKING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES EXTENSIVELY REGULATE THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, INCLUDING PRESCRIBING STANDARDS RELATING TO CAPITAL, EARNINGS, LIQUIDITY,

DIVIDENDS, THE REPURCHASE OR REDEMPTION OF SHARES, LOANS OR EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO AFFILIATES AND INSIDERS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, RISK MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL AUDIT SYSTEMS, LOAN DOCUMENTATION, CREDIT UNDERWRITING, ASSET GROWTH AND

IMPAIRED ASSETS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR DEPOSITORS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS, AS WELL AS TO MINIMIZE SYSTEMIC RISK, AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION

OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS OR OTHER CREDITORS. FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008, NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE PROMULGATED AND SUPERVISORY EFFORTS TO APPLY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES HAVE BECOME MORE INTENSE THROUGH INCREASED EXAMINATION

SCRUTINY, HEIGHTENED REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS REGARDING COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS

ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, AND HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE FEDERAL

RESERVE. UNDER THE SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISES THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES, AS AN UMBRELLA REGULATOR OF THE CONSOLIDATED

ORGANIZATION AND GENERALLY DEFERS TO THE PRIMARY U.S. REGULATORS OF THE COMPANYS U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE BROAD EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT POWER OVER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR

SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THE POWER TO IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL FINES, LIMIT DIVIDENDS AND OTHER CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, RESTRICT OPERATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS, AND REQUIRE DIVESTITURES. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANKS, AS WELL AS SUBSIDIARIES OF BOTH, ARE

PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ENGAGING IN PRACTICES THAT THE RELEVANT REGULATORY AUTHORITY DEEMS UNSAFE OR UNSOUND. THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION, EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT BY THE

CFPB WITH RESPECT TO MARKETING AND SALE OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER LAWS, THE CFPA AND THE TILA, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW UNDER  CONSUMER FINANCIAL

PROTECTION ACT OF 2010.

MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS REGULATION BY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL

AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND BY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR REGULATORY BODIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES. CERTAIN OF OUR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES ARE

SUBJECT TO THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2002 (SARBANES-OXLEY) AND RELATED REGULATIONS AND RULES OF THE SEC AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TO THE EXTENT THAT DIFFERENT REGULATORY SYSTEMS

IMPOSE OVERLAPPING OR INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE FACE COMPLEXITY AND ADDITIONAL COSTS IN OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS. NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN

INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT) AS WELL AS THE ENFORCEMENT OF BOTH EXISTING AND NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION, SEE

THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT

DODD-FRANK, WHICH WAS ENACTED IN JULY 2010, SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRUCTURED THE FINANCIAL REGULATORY REGIME IN THE UNITED STATES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, DODD-FRANK CREATED A NEW SYSTEMIC RISK OVERSIGHT

BODY, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (THE FSOC), WHICH OVERSEES AND COORDINATES THE EFFORTS OF THE PRIMARY U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATORY AGENCIES (INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE SEC, THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES

TRADING COMMISSION, THE OCC AND THE FDIC) IN ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL STABILITY CONCERNS. DODD-FRANK ALSO DIRECTS THE FSOC TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AS TO SUPERVISORY REQUIREMENTS AND PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS

APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE THE COMPANY, AND NONBANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES DESIGNATED BY THE FSOC FOR SUPERVISION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. AS DISCUSSED FURTHER

THROUGHOUT THIS SECTION, CERTAIN ASPECTS OF DODD-FRANK ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER RULEMAKING AND WILL TAKE EFFECT OVER SEVERAL YEARS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE THE OVERALL FINANCIAL IMPACT ON US OR ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION TO THE

DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION, SEE 

THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

IN RISK

FACTORS BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DODD-FRANK.

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT OF 2010

ENACTED AS PART OF DODD-FRANK, THE CFPA CREATED THE CFPB, A CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATOR. ON JULY 21, 2011, OUR MARKETING AND SALE OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH

CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE CFPA AND THE TILA, BECAME SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE CFPB. THE CFPB ALSO ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FROM OUR CURRENT BANKING REGULATORS FOR SUPERVISION, EXAMINATION AND

ENFORCEMENT OF CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB AND THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS AND THEN-EXISTING REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THOSE LAWS.

DODD-FRANK ALSO TRANSFERRED TO THE CFPB EXCLUSIVE RULEMAKING AUTHORITY FOR SUCH FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS AND AUTHORIZED THE CFPB

TO PROHIBIT UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES AND TO ENSURE THAT ALL CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO MARKETS FOR CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THAT SUCH MARKETS ARE FAIR, TRANSPARENT AND COMPETITIVE. THE REVIEW OF

PRODUCTS AND PRACTICES TO PREVENT UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE CONDUCT WILL BE A CONTINUING FOCUS OF THE CFPB AND BANKING REGULATORS MORE BROADLY, AS WELL AS BY THE COMPANY ITSELF.

IN JULY 2012 THE CFPB ISSUED AN INDUSTRY BULLETIN REGARDING ITS REVIEW OF MARKETING PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO CREDIT CARD ADD-ON

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DEBT CANCELLATION, IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION, CREDIT REPORTING AND MONITORING, AND OTHER SUPPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS. WE ARE COOPERATING WITH REGULATORS IN THEIR ONGOING REGULATORY EXAMINATIONS OF CREDIT CARD ADD-ON PRODUCTS. FOR A

DESCRIPTION OF THE SETTLEMENTS REACHED WITH, AND ONGOING REVIEWS BY, SEVERAL BANK REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE CFPB, RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS U.S. CONSUMER CARD PRACTICES, SEE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS AND DEPOSIT PROGRAMS

THE BHC ACT LIMITS THE NONBANKING ACTIVITIES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. THE ACTIVITIES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT

HAVE NOT ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES ARE RESTRICTED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DETERMINED ARE SO CLOSELY RELATED TO BANKING AS TO BE A PROPER INCIDENT THERETO. AN ELIGIBLE BANK

HOLDING COMPANY MAY ELECT TO BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES. A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY MAY ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY RULE OR ORDER TO BE

FINANCIAL IN NATURE,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCIDENTAL TO SUCH FINANCIAL ACTIVITY, OR (WITH PRIOR FEDERAL RESERVE APPROVAL) COMPLEMENTARY TO A FINANCIAL ACTIVITY AND THAT DOES NOT POSE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THE SAFETY OR SOUNDNESS OF A

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR TO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM GENERALLY. AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN VARIOUS ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE ONLY FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY

INCLUDING, IN PARTICULAR, PROVIDING TRAVEL AGENCY SERVICES, ACTING AS A FINDER AND ENGAGING IN CERTAIN INSURANCE UNDERWRITING AND AGENCY SERVICES.

FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO BECOME AND REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST BE WELL

CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED, AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST A SATISFACTORY RATING ON ITS MOST RECENT ASSESSMENT UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT OF 1977 (THE

CRA). IF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MEET APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS (WHICH, IN MOST CASES, IS CONFIDENTIAL SUPERVISORY INFORMATION), IT IS LIKELY TO BE BARRED FROM ENGAGING IN NEW TYPES OF FINANCIAL

ACTIVITIES OR MAKING CERTAIN TYPES OF ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS IN RELIANCE ON ITS STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, AND ULTIMATELY COULD BE REQUIRED TO EITHER DISCONTINUE THE BROADER RANGE OF ACTIVITIES PERMITTED TO FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANIES OR DIVEST ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DODD-FRANK CREATED A NEW SYSTEMIC RISK OVERSIGHT BODY, THE FSOC, TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND ADDRESS POTENTIAL THREATS TO U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY. ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK IMPOSES

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, AND REQUIRES THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ESTABLISH PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR SUCH LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT

ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE APPLICABLE TO OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND LEVERAGE LIMITS, LIQUIDITY, RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS, RESOLUTION PLANS (REFERRED TO AS LIVING

WILLS), STRESS TESTS, EARLY REDEMPTION, CREDIT EXPOSURE REPORTING AND CONCENTRATION. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS ON ITS OWN OR AT THE FSOCS RECOMMENDATION REGARDING

CONTINGENT CAPITAL, ENHANCED PUBLIC DISCLOSURES, SHORT-TERM DEBT LIMITS AND OTHERWISE AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY, ON ITS OWN VOLITION OR IN RESPONSE TO A RECOMMENDATION BY THE FSOC, TAILOR THE APPLICATION OF THESE

ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS TO SPECIFIC COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THESE ENHANCED STANDARDS ON THE COMPANY IS NOT CERTAIN.

IN OCTOBER 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED RULES RELATING TO SUPERVISORY AND COMPANY-RUN STRESS TESTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER 

STRESS TESTING

. WITH

RESPECT TO THE REMAINING ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS, IN JANUARY 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUBLISHED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING TO IMPLEMENT MANY OF THE HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING.



ENHANCED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS.

SEE BASEL III BELOW.



ENHANCED LIQUIDITY STANDARDS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVES NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING STATES THAT THE ENHANCED LIQUIDITY STANDARDS WILL BE

ADDRESSED IN STAGES. AS THE FIRST STAGE OF THIS UNDERTAKING, THE PROPOSED RULES FOCUS ON PRUDENTIAL STEPS TO MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH COMPREHENSIVELY DETAIL LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND

SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND WOULD REQUIRE.



MAINTENANCE OF A LIQUIDITY BUFFER, CONSISTING OF ASSETS MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS, THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET PROJECTED NET CASH OUTFLOWS AND PROJECTED

LOSS OR IMPAIRMENT OF EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES FOR 30 DAYS OVER A RANGE OF LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIOS;



PRODUCTION OF COMPREHENSIVE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS AND IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF DISCRETE AND CUMULATIVE CASH FLOW MISMATCHES;



REGULAR STRESS TESTING OF CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS OVER VARIOUS TIME HORIZONS;



ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN THAT SETS OUT STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING LIQUIDITY NEEDS DURING LIQUIDITY STRESS EVENTS;



ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF LIMITS ON POTENTIAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY RISK, INCLUDING CONCENTRATIONS OF FUNDING, MATURITY OF SPECIFIED LIABILITIES

WITHIN VARIOUS TIME HORIZONS, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES THAT COULD CREATE FUNDING NEEDS DURING LIQUIDITY STRESS EVENTS; AND

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS



VARIETY OF MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE NOTED THAT IT WOULD IMPLEMENT THE SECOND STAGE OF A REGULATORY LIQUIDITY FRAMEWORK FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, OR A SUBSET

OF SUCH BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, THROUGH FUTURE PROPOSALS THAT WOULD REQUIRE SUCH BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO SATISFY SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS DERIVED FROM OR CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL LIQUIDITY STANDARDS INCORPORATED INTO THE BASEL III

FRAMEWORK (DISCUSSED BELOW).



SINGLE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS.

UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2013, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR

MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS GENERALLY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A LIMIT ON AGGREGATE NET CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY SINGLE UNAFFILIATED COUNTERPARTY EQUAL TO 25% OF CAPITAL STOCK AND SURPLUS.



ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.

UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A DEDICATED RISK COMMITTEE REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH WOULD DOCUMENT, REVIEW AND APPROVE THE ENTERPRISE-WIDE

RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OF THE COMPANY. THE RISK COMMITTEE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE RISK MANAGEMENT EXPERT AND WOULD BE REQUIRED TO OVERSEE THE OPERATION OF AN

ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK COMMENSURATE WITH THE COMPANYS CAPITAL STRUCTURE, RISK PROFILE, COMPLEXITY, ACTIVITIES, SIZE AND OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK-RELATED FACTORS, AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS SET FORTH

IN THE PROPOSED RULE. SUCH BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO APPOINT A CHIEF RISK OFFICER.

BECAUSE THE PROPOSED RULE IS NOT FINAL, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THESE MEASURES ON US IS NOT CERTAIN.

DODD-FRANK ALSO MANDATES THAT CERTAIN EXPENSES OF THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL RESEARCH, WHICH INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE FSOC AND CERTAIN EXPENSES OF THE FDIC, BE FUNDED

THROUGH ASSESSMENTS ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES SUPERVISED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IN MAY 2012, THE U.S. TREASURY ISSUED A RULE

SETTING FORTH THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE ASSESSMENTS WOULD BE MADE. UNDER THIS RULE, THE TOTAL OF THE COVERED EXPENSES WILL BE DISTRIBUTED PRO RATA (BASED ON CONSOLIDATED ASSETS) AMONG BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS.

STRESS TESTING

IN OCTOBER 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED RULES RELATING TO SUPERVISORY AND COMPANY-RUN STRESS TESTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. THESE RULES REQUIRE ANALYSES OF CERTAIN LARGE BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE COMPANIES HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL ON A TOTAL CONSOLIDATED BASIS NECESSARY TO ABSORB LOSSES AS A RESULT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (SO-CALLED STRESS TESTS). THESE RULES IMPLEMENT A KEY PORTION OF THE

ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DODD-FRANK AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTING.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST CONDUCT ANNUAL STRESS TESTS OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS. UNDER THIS RULE, THE STRESS TESTS USE A MINIMUM OF THREE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SCENARIOS GENERATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE (BASELINE, ADVERSE AND SEVERELY ADVERSE), AND BE BASED ON METHODOLOGIES AND DATA THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE

WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO COMPANIES NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR. A SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL STRESS TESTS WILL BE MADE PUBLIC BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON A COMPANY-SPECIFIC BASIS.



COMPANY STRESS TESTING.

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE 2009

SUPERVISORY CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAM, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A SIMILAR STRESS TEST ON A SEMIANNUAL BASIS. A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF EACH OF THESE TESTS MUST BE PUBLICLY DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE OTHER FEDERAL

BANK REGULATORS TO ISSUE REGULATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STRESS TEST REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, WHICH WOULD ULTIMATELY APPLY TO CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IN OCTOBER 2012, THE FDIC AND THE OCC ISSUED RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE

ANNUAL COMPANY STRESS TESTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE APPLIES ITS STRESS TESTS RULES AND ITS CAPITAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS, DISCUSSED IN

CAPITAL PLANNING

BELOW, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAPITAL PLANNING

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN

A SO-CALLED CAPITAL PLAN, AND TO SUBMIT THE CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR REVIEW. THE CAPITAL PLAN MUST COVER A PLANNING HORIZON OF AT LEAST NINE QUARTERS (BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER PRECEDING THE SUBMISSION OF THE

PLAN) AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS.



AN ASSESSMENT OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS EXPECTED USES AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL OVER THE PLANNING HORIZON THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE BANK HOLDING

COMPANYS SIZE, COMPLEXITY, RISK PROFILE AND SCOPE OF OPERATIONS, AND UNDER EXPECTED AND STRESSFUL CONDITIONS ACCORDING TO SCENARIOS DEVELOPED BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE;



A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS PROCESS FOR ASSESSING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, INCLUDING HOW IT WILL, UNDER EXPECTED AND STRESSFUL

CONDITIONS, MAINTAIN CAPITAL COMMENSURATE WITH ITS RISKS, ABOVE THE MINIMUM REGULATORY RATIOS, AND TO SERVE AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ITS SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, AND SUFFICIENT TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS BY MAINTAINING STEADY ACCESS TO

FUNDING, MEETING OBLIGATIONS TO CREDITORS AND OTHER COUNTERPARTIES AND CONTINUING TO SERVE AS A CREDIT INTERMEDIARY;



THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS CAPITAL POLICY; AND



A DISCUSSION OF ANY EXPECTED CHANGES TO THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BUSINESS.

EACH CAPITAL PLAN MUST CONSIDER A MINIMUM OF FOUR PLANNING SCENARIOS, INCLUDING SEPARATE BASELINE AND STRESSED SCENARIOS DEVELOPED BY THE

BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE STRESSED SCENARIO DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR THE 2013 PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO REPRESENT AN OUTCOME THAT, IN THE OPINION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, IS UNLIKELY, BUT COULD OCCUR IF THE U.S.

ECONOMY WERE TO EXPERIENCE A DEEP RECESSION WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIES WERE ALSO TO CONTRACT SIGNIFICANTLY. IN ADDITION TO OTHER LIMITATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO MAKE ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS (INCLUDING DIVIDENDS

AND SHARE REPURCHASES) IS CONTINGENT ON THE FEDERAL RESERVES APPROVAL OR NON-OBJECTION TO OUR CAPITAL PLAN. LIKEWISE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ANY CAPITAL ACTIONS SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO INCLUDE ANY INTENDED ACTION

IN ITS CAPITAL PLAN.

A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OR A DESIGNATED COMMITTEE THEREOF, IS REQUIRED, AT

LEAST ANNUALLY, TO REVIEW THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS PROCESS FOR ASSESSING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, ENSURE THAT ANY DEFICIENCIES ARE REMEDIED AND APPROVE THE CAPITAL PLAN.

IN ITS REVIEW OF THE CAPITAL PLAN, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL CONSIDER THE PLANS COMPREHENSIVENESS, THE REASONABLENESS OF ITS

ASSUMPTIONS AND ANALYSIS, AND THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS METHODOLOGIES FOR REVIEWING THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY PROCESS AND ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL ABOVE MINIMUM REGULATORY RATIOS UNDER EXPECTED AND STRESSFUL CONDITIONS

THROUGHOUT THE PLANNING HORIZON. BASED ON ITS REVIEW, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL EITHER OBJECT OR NOT OBJECT TO THE CAPITAL PLAN. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BROAD AUTHORITY TO OBJECT TO CAPITAL PLANS, AND TO REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO REVISE AND

RESUBMIT THEIR CAPITAL PLANS FOR APPROVAL. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AN ONGOING REQUIREMENT TO REVISE AND RESUBMIT THEIR CAPITAL PLANS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS SPECIFIED BY RULE, OR WHEN REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

IF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY RECEIVES AN OBJECTION TO ITS CAPITAL PLAN, IT MUST RESUBMIT A REVISED PLAN WITHIN 30 DAYS. SHOULD THE FEDERAL RESERVE OBJECT TO A CAPITAL PLAN, A BANK HOLDING COMPANY MAY NOT MAKE ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION OTHER THAN THOSE

CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED NON-OBJECTION TO IN WRITING.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED

THAT IT INTENDS TO PUBLISH THE RESULTS OF ITS REVIEW OF THE PORTION OF EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANYS CAPITAL PLAN THAT RELATES TO THE STRESS SCENARIO DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED WILL INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, COMPANY-SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT PROJECTED POST-STRESS CAPITAL RATIOS AND THE MINIMUM VALUE OF THESE RATIOS OVER THE PLANNING HORIZON. ADDITIONALLY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY LIMIT THE COMPANYS CAPITAL ACTIONS SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL

TO INCLUDE ANY INTENDED ACTION IN ITS APPROVED 2013 CAPITAL PLAN.

IN NOVEMBER 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE RELEASED ADDITIONAL

GUIDANCE AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR 2013 CAPITAL PLANS. UNDER THIS GUIDANCE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE NOTED THAT CERTAIN LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, WILL HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO ADJUST DOWNWARD PLANNED CAPITAL ACTIONS IN LIGHT OF STRESS

TEST RESULTS. SHOULD AN ADJUSTMENT OCCUR, HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE INTENDS TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THE RESULTS OF STRESS TESTS USING BOTH THE ORIGINAL AND ADJUSTED 2013 CAPITAL PLANS. ADDITIONALLY, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT YET IN EFFECT, THE FEDERAL

RESERVES GUIDANCE REQUIRES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT CAN ACHIEVE THE CAPITAL RATIOS REQUIRED BY THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK AS IT WOULD COME INTO EFFECT.

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON JANUARY 7, 2013, WE SUBMITTED OUR COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

WE EXPECT A RESPONSE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BY MARCH 14, 2013.

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANY AND TRS, AS WELL AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ARE LIMITED BY BANKING STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISORY POLICY IN THEIR

ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN GENERAL, FEDERAL AND APPLICABLE STATE BANKING LAWS PROHIBIT, WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL, INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM MAKING DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS IF SUCH

DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT PAID OUT OF AVAILABLE RECENT EARNINGS OR WOULD CAUSE THE INSTITUTION TO FAIL TO MEET CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS. AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER 

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

, THE FDIA ALSO GENERALLY PROHIBITS AN

FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FROM MAKING ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION (INCLUDING PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS) OR PAYING ANY MANAGEMENT FEE TO ITS HOLDING COMPANY IF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD THEREAFTER BE UNDERCAPITALIZED. IN ADDITION TO SPECIFIC

LIMITATIONS ON THE DIVIDENDS THAT SUBSIDIARY BANKS CAN PAY TO THEIR HOLDING COMPANIES, FEDERAL REGULATORS COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING

ORGANIZATION.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND TRS TO SHAREHOLDERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

IT IS FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY SHOULD PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS ONLY OUT OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND ONLY IF THE PROSPECTIVE RATE OF EARNINGS

RETENTION APPEARS CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY AND OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION. INCREASINGLY, HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS LIMITED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO ABOUT 30% OF EARNINGS.

MOREOVER, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN DIVIDEND LEVELS THAT PLACE UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE CAPITAL OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OR THAT MAY UNDERMINE THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ITS

BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND BY THE COMPANY OR TRS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, ITS PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS IS SUBJECT TO

HEIGHTENED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO INCLUDE PROJECTED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN THE CAPITAL PLAN REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE, DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER 

CAPITAL PLANNING

, AND THE RESTRICTIONS

IMPOSED AS PART OF THE CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS WILL LIKELY BE THE PRINCIPAL LIMITATION ON OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS (INCLUDING DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES). IN ADDITION, UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVES FINAL RULE RELATING TO

CAPITAL PLANS RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE COMPANY GENERALLY IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PRIOR APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE IT CAN MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, UNDER ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES (REGARDLESS

OF WHETHER THE DISTRIBUTION IS PART OF A CAPITAL PLAN TO WHICH THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS NOT OBJECTED).



THE COMPANY WILL NOT MEET A MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIO OR A TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY RATIO OF AT LEAST 5% AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE CAPITAL

DISTRIBUTION;



THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS NOTIFIED THE COMPANY THAT IT HAS DETERMINED THAT EITHER (I) THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION WILL RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE

CHANGE TO THE COMPANYS CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY STRUCTURE, OR (II) THE COMPANYS EARNINGS ARE MATERIALLY UNDERPERFORMING PROJECTIONS;



THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION WILL EXCEED THE PROJECTED DISTRIBUTION DESCRIBED IN THE COMPANYS APPROVED CAPITAL PLAN; OR



THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION WILL OCCUR AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT REQUIRING THE RESUBMISSION (OTHER THAN PURSUANT TO AN OBJECTION) OF THE

COMPANYS CAPITAL PLAN AND BEFORE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ACTED ON THE RESUBMITTED PLAN.

PRIOR

APPROVAL OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS IS NOT REQUIRED FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS THAT ARE WELL CAPITALIZED, PROVIDED THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION DOES NOT EXCEED ONE PERCENT OF

SUCH COMPANYS TIER 1 CAPITAL, THE COMPANY PROVIDES THE FEDERAL RESERVE WITH AT LEAST 15 CALENDAR DAYS NOTICE OF THE PROPOSED DISTRIBUTION, AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE DOES NOT OBJECT. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT CAPITAL PLANS

IMPLYING DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS ABOVE 30% OF PROJECTED AFTER-TAX NET INCOME WILL RECEIVE PARTICULARLY CLOSE SCRUTINY.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIVING WILLS

AS NOTED ABOVE, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE AND PROVIDE TO REGULATORS A RESOLUTION PLAN. THE RESOLUTION PLAN IS MANDATED UNDER THE

DODD-FRANK ACT, WHICH REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR GREATER TO SUBMIT A PLAN FOR RAPID AND ORDERLY RESOLUTION UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE. PURSUANT TO A RULE THAT TOOK EFFECT

IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE FIRST SUCH RESOLUTION PLAN FOR US IS REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED BY DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND ANNUAL UPDATES WILL BE REQUIRED THEREAFTER. THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS RESOLUTION PLAN MAY, AS A PRACTICAL MATTER,

PRESENT ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN OUR BANK AND NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

ACTIVITIES AND ACQUISITIONS

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO BANKING LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ACTIVITIES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS. IN ADDITION,

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF OUR REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE FDIC. THE BANKING AGENCIES HAVE BROAD DISCRETION IN EVALUATING PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS. IN

DECIDING WHETHER TO APPROVE AN ACQUISITION, FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES MAY CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, EFFECTS OF THE ACQUISITION ON COMPETITION, FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL RESOURCES, AND FINANCIAL STABILITY; FUTURE PROSPECTS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND

PROJECTED CAPITAL RATIOS AND LEVELS; THE COMPETENCE AND EXPERTISE OF MANAGEMENT AND OUR RECORD OF COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS; PUBLIC BENEFITS; THE CONVENIENCE AND NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES

RECORD OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CRA; RISKS TO THE STABILITY OF THE U.S. BANKING OR FINANCIAL SYSTEM; AND OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING. AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, WE MAY ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF FINANCIAL AND RELATED

ACTIVITIES THAN ARE OTHERWISE PERMISSIBLE FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES NOTED ABOVE.

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BHC ACT REQUIRES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE: (1) IT MAY ACQUIRE DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING

SHARES OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, IF AFTER SUCH ACQUISITION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WILL DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWN OR CONTROL MORE THAN 5% OF ANY CLASS OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF THE INSTITUTION; (2) IT OR ANY OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, OTHER THAN A BANK, MAY ACQUIRE ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION (THE BANK MERGER ACT REQUIRES REGULATORY APPROVAL BEFORE A BANK SUBSIDIARY MAY MAKE SUCH AN ACQUISITION); OR (3) IT

MAY MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH ANY OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST APPROVE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL

CONTRIBUTIONS TO AN EXISTING NON-U.S. INVESTMENT AND CERTAIN DIRECT AND INDIRECT ACQUISITIONS BY THE COMPANY OF AN INTEREST IN A NON-U.S. COMPANY, INCLUDING IN A FOREIGN BANK. DODD-FRANK REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS

EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN $50 BILLION TO PROVIDE THE FEDERAL RESERVE WITH WRITTEN NOTICE (WHICH IS LARGELY TANTAMOUNT TO AN APPROVAL PROCESS) PRIOR TO ACQUIRING DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF ANY COMPANY (OTHER THAN

AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION) THAT IS ENGAGED IN FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN SECTION 4(K) OF THE BHC ACT AND THAT HAS TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $10 BILLION OR MORE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. DODD-FRANK ALSO REQUIRES FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANIES TO OBTAIN FEDERAL RESERVE APPROVAL PRIOR TO ACQUIRING ANY NONBANK COMPANY WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS IN EXCESS OF $10 BILLION.

APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS ALSO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF PERSONS TO INVEST IN OR ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY WITHOUT PROVIDING NOTICE TO OR OBTAINING THE APPROVAL OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR REGULATORS.

THE CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL ACT PROHIBITS A PERSON, ENTITY, OR GROUP OF PERSONS OR ENTITIES ACTING IN CONCERT, FROM DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ACQUIRING CONTROL OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUCH AS THE COMPANY, UNLESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS

BEEN GIVEN PRIOR NOTICE AND HAS NOT OBJECTED TO THE TRANSACTION. UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS, THE ACQUISITION OF 10% OR MORE OF A CLASS OF VOTING STOCK OF THE COMPANY WOULD GENERALLY CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF

THE COMPANY AND REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE TO AND NON-OBJECTION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE BHC ACT, ANY PERSON OR COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE ACQUIRING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, WHICH, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OF OR CONTROL OVER 25% OR MORE OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY OR THE POWER TO EXERCISE A CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER THE COMPANY. IN THE CASE OF AN ACQUIRER THAT IS A

BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE BHC ACT REQUIRES APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY, IF THE ACQUISITION RESULTS IN THE BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY CONTROLLING MORE

THAN 5% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SOURCE OF STRENGTH

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTE TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ALL OF THEIR INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARIES. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BOTH INSTITUTIONS. SUCH SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED AT TIMES WHEN,

ABSENT THIS REQUIREMENT, THE COMPANY OTHERWISE MIGHT DETERMINE NOT TO PROVIDE IT.

CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING

COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE EVENT OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY

TO A FEDERAL BANK REGULATOR TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK WILL BE ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY

THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND

AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE TWO RISK-BASED MEASURES OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN PROMULGATED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE, AS WELL AS A LEVERAGE MEASURE. AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW, NEW RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE MEASURES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENCES IN RISK PROFILES AMONG BANKS AND FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, TO ACCOUNT FOR OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

EXPOSURE, AND TO MINIMIZE DISINCENTIVES FOR HOLDING LIQUID ASSETS. CAPITAL RATIOS REPRESENT CAPITAL (AS DEFINED) AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS. AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER, THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES

EXPECT MOST BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, AND IN PARTICULAR LARGER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS THE COMPANY, TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS THAT, AT A MINIMUM, QUALIFY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES AS

WELL CAPITALIZED. THE REQUIRED RATIOS TO QUALIFY AS WELL CAPITALIZED ARE CURRENTLY A TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10%, A TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6% AND, FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, A LEVERAGE RATIO

OF AT LEAST 5%. THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES (AS DEFINED BELOW), IF IMPLEMENTED IN THE FORM PROPOSED, WILL AMEND THE CAPITAL RATIOS REQUIRED FOR WELL CAPITALIZED STATUS. THE RULES ALSO PROVIDE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES EXPERIENCING INTERNAL GROWTH

OR MAKING ACQUISITIONS WILL BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN STRONG CAPITAL POSITIONS SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE MINIMUM SUPERVISORY LEVELS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT RELIANCE ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FOLLOWING THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY

AGENCIES HAVE ENCOURAGED LARGER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL RATIOS APPRECIABLY ABOVE THE WELL CAPITALIZED STANDARD. MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS FOCUSING MORE ON THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENT THAT COMMON EQUITY BE THE

PREDOMINANT ELEMENT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. FURTHERMORE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL CONSIDER A TANGIBLE TIER 1 CAPITAL LEVERAGE RATIO (DEDUCTING ALL INTANGIBLES) AND OTHER INDICATORS OF CAPITAL

STRENGTH IN EVALUATING PROPOSALS FOR EXPANSION OR NEW ACTIVITIES.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CAPITAL RATIOS,

SEE CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY ON PAGES 29-31 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

GENERAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES

THE COMPANY, TRS,

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB CURRENTLY CALCULATE REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER RULES ADOPTED BY THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCY, BASED ON THE 1988 CAPITAL ACCORD (BASEL I) OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE

BASEL COMMITTEE). THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES REFER TO THESE CAPITAL RULES AS THEIR GENERAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES. UNDER THESE RULES, THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE RATIO OF TOTAL CAPITAL TO

RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (INCLUDING CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS, SUCH AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT) IS 8%. AT LEAST HALF OF THE TOTAL CAPITAL MUST BE COMPOSED OF TIER 1 CAPITAL, WHICH INCLUDES COMMON EQUITY, UNDIVIDED PROFITS, MINORITY

INTERESTS IN THE EQUITY ACCOUNTS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, AND NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK (AND, UNDER EXISTING STANDARDS, A LIMITED AMOUNT OF QUALIFYING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND QUALIFYING CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK

AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL), LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY CONSIST OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, QUALIFYING SUBORDINATED DEBT, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, OTHER PREFERRED STOCK AND TRUST

PREFERRED SECURITIES AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

DODD-FRANK APPLIES TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH

AS THE COMPANY THE SAME RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. GOING FORWARD THIS WILL PRECLUDE THE COMPANY FROM INCLUDING IN

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TIER 1 CAPITAL TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES OR CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, IF ANY, ISSUED ON OR AFTER MAY 19, 2010 AND, OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2013, AND REQUIRES

THE COMPANY TO PHASE OUT ALL TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK FROM INCLUSION IN ITS TIER 1 CAPITAL. THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS IS 4%.

THE GENERAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES STATE THAT THE CAPITAL RULES ARE MINIMUM STANDARDS BASED PRIMARILY ON BROAD CREDIT-RISK

CONSIDERATIONS AND DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE OTHER TYPES OF RISK A BANKING ORGANIZATION MAY BE EXPOSED TO (E.G., INTEREST RATE, MARKET, LIQUIDITY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS). THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY, THEREFORE, SET HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR

CATEGORIES OF BANKS (E.G., SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FIRMS), OR FOR AN INDIVIDUAL BANK, AS SITUATIONS WARRANT. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN FACT EXPECTS LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AND THEIR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS WELL IN EXCESS OF THESE MINIMUMS.

ADVANCED APPROACHES RISK BASED

CAPITAL RULES

IN JUNE 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ISSUED THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF CAPITAL

MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS (BASEL II). THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES REFER TO THEIR BASEL II-BASED RULES AS THEIR ADVANCED APPROACHES RULES AND APPLY THEM ONLY TO BANKING INSTITUTIONS HAVING $250

BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OR $10 BILLION OR MORE IN FOREIGN EXPOSURES. THE AGENCIES REFER TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS AS ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTIONS. THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO ENTER THE

PARALLEL-RUN PERIOD AND COMMENCE CALCULATING THEIR RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER THE ADVANCED APPROACHES RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES, WHILE CONTINUING TO CALCULATE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER THE GENERAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES AS A FLOOR, BY

JANUARY 1, 2014, UNLESS EXTENDED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS. THE U.S. ADVANCED APPROACHES RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2008, INITIALLY PROVIDED THAT ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE COMPANY WOULD

CALCULATE THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ONLY UNDER THE NEW BASEL II-BASED REQUIREMENTS AFTER COMPLETION OF THREE TRANSITIONAL FLOOR PERIODS, WHICH THEMSELVES COMMENCE AFTER A SATISFACTORY PARALLEL-RUN PERIOD OF NO LESS THAN FOUR CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR

QUARTERS DURING WHICH THE INSTITUTION IS REQUIRED TO CONFIDENTIALLY REPORT REGULATORY CAPITAL UNDER BOTH THE GENERAL AND ADVANCED APPROACHES RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES. HOWEVER, THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES HAVE AMENDED THEIR CAPITAL RULES TO PROVIDE

THAT MINIMUM CAPITAL AS REQUIRED UNDER THE GENERAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES WILL ACT AS A FLOOR FOR MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADVANCED APPROACHES RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES.

IN JUNE 2012, THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES RELEASED PROPOSED RULES IMPLEMENTING STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO CREDIT RISK OUTLINED IN

THE BASEL II-BASED RULES (THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH RULES). THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH RULES WOULD REPLACE THE RISK-WEIGHTING CATEGORIES FOR ASSETS UNDER THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES GENERAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES TO

PROVIDE A MORE RISK-SENSITIVE TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND TO ADDRESS WEAKNESSES THAT THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS IDENTIFIED OVER RECENT YEARS. THE NEW RISK-WEIGHTS FOR THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH RANGE FROM 0% TO 600% AS COMPARED TO THE

RISK-WEIGHTS OF 0% TO 100% IN THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES EXISTING GENERAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES. HIGHER RISK WEIGHTS WOULD APPLY TO A VARIETY OF EXPOSURES, INCLUDING CERTAIN SECURITIZATION EXPOSURES, EQUITY EXPOSURES, CLAIMS ON

SECURITIES FIRMS AND EXPOSURES TO COUNTERPARTIES ON OTC DERIVATIVES. THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES JUNE 2012 PROPOSAL PROVIDED THAT THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH RULES WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2015, WITH AN OPTION FOR EARLY

ADOPTION.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT

BASEL I AND BASEL II DO NOT INCLUDE A LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD. HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO RULES FOR BANKING

INSTITUTIONS (AND, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW, THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES WILL IMPOSE AN ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE RATIO). THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES EXISTING CAPITAL RULES PROVIDE FOR A MINIMUM RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE TOTAL

ASSETS, LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (THE LEVERAGE RATIO), OF 3.0% FOR BANKING INSTITUTIONS THAT MEET CERTAIN SPECIFIED CRITERIA, INCLUDING HAVING THE HIGHEST REGULATORY RATING. ALL OTHER BANKING INSTITUTIONS ARE

GENERALLY REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 4.0%. THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES PROPOSED REVISED CAPITAL RULES RELEASED IN JUNE 2012, IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING THEIR STANDARDIZED APPROACH RULES AND PROPOSED BASEL III

RULES (AS DEFINED BELOW), IF IMPLEMENTED, WILL ELIMINATE THE 3.0% MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FOR CERTAIN BANKING INSTITUTIONS, WITH THE CONSEQUENCE THAT ALL BANKING INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 4.0%.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BASEL III

IN JUNE 2012, THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES RELEASED PROPOSED RULES (THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES) IMPLEMENTING THE FINAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY

REGULATION, KNOWN AS BASEL III, RELEASED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE IN DECEMBER 2010. THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES, AMONG OTHER THINGS.



INTRODUCE AS A NEW CAPITAL MEASURE COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1), SPECIFY THAT TIER 1 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF CET1 AND

ADDITIONAL TIER 1 CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS MEETING SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS, REQUIRE THAT MOST ADJUSTMENTS TO REGULATORY CAPITAL MEASURES (SUCH AS THE DEDUCTIONS DESCRIBED BELOW) BE MADE TO CET1 AND NOT TO THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL,

AND EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE ADJUSTMENTS AS COMPARED TO EXISTING REGULATIONS



WHEN FULLY PHASED IN, REQUIRE BANKING INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN.



A MINIMUM RATIO OF CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST 4.5%, PLUS A 2.5% CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH IS ADDED TO THE 4.5% CET1

RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS PHASED IN, EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN A MINIMUM RATIO OF CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST 7% (THERE IS NO COMPARABLE CET1 REQUIREMENT UNDER EITHER THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES GENERAL OR ADVANCED

APPROACHES RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES)



A MINIMUM RATIO OF TIER 1 (THAT IS, CET1 PLUS ADDITIONAL TIER 1 CAPITAL) CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST 6.0%, PLUS THE CAPITAL

CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH IS ADDED TO THE 6.0% TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS PHASED IN, EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN A MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO OF 8.5% UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION (THE CURRENT MINIMUM REQUIREMENT IS 4.0% )



A MINIMUM RATIO OF TOTAL CAPITAL (THAT IS, TIER 1 CAPITAL PLUS TIER 2 CAPITAL) TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST 8.0%, PLUS THE

CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH IS ADDED TO THE 8.0% TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS PHASED IN, EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN A MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 10.5% UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION (THE CURRENT MINIMUM REQUIREMENT IS 8.0%)



APPLY TO ADVANCED APPROACHES BANKING INSTITUTIONS ONLY, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, A NEW BASEL III-BASED LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 3.0%, CALCULATED AS THE

RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AN EXPANDED CONCEPT OF LEVERAGE EXPOSURE THAT INCLUDES BOTH ON-BALANCE SHEET AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES



FOR ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTIONS ONLY, INTRODUCE A COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, AN ADD-ON TO THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER IN THE

RANGE OF 0% TO 2.5% (POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN TOTAL BUFFERS OF UP TO 5.0% BEING ADDED TO EACH OF THE RATIOS OF CET1, TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS), WHICH CAN BE ASSESSED WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN BANKING INSTITUTIONS AND

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WHEN THE RELEVANT U.S. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR DETERMINES EXCESS AGGREGATE CREDIT GROWTH BECOMES ASSOCIATED WITH A BUILDUP OF SYSTEMIC RISK

BANKING INSTITUTIONS WHOSE RATIO OF CET1, TIER 1 CAPITAL OR TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS IS ABOVE THE MINIMUM BUT BELOW THE

CONSERVATION BUFFER (OR BELOW THE COMBINED CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER AND COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, WHEN THE LATTER IS APPLIED) WILL FACE CONSTRAINTS ON DIVIDENDS, EQUITY REPURCHASES AND COMPENSATION BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF THE SHORTFALL.

THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES PROVIDE FOR A NUMBER OF NEW DEDUCTIONS FROM AND ADJUSTMENTS TO CET1. THESE INCLUDE THE

REQUIREMENT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS DEPENDENT UPON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NON-CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ENTITIES AND MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, BE DEDUCTED FROM CET1 TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY ONE SUCH CATEGORY EXCEEDS 10% OF

CET1 OR ALL SUCH CATEGORIES IN THE AGGREGATE EXCEED 15% OF CET1. THE AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS THAT IS NOT DEDUCTED FROM CET1 WILL BE RISK WEIGHTED AT 250%. GOODWILL WILL BE SUBJECT TO A FULL DEDUCTION FROM CET1, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

CALCULATION OF OTHER CAPITAL RATIOS.

THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES INITIALLY STATED THAT THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES

WOULD BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013, BUT IN NOVEMBER 2012 INDICATED THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RULES WOULD BE DELAYED. THE FINAL RULES AS IMPLEMENTED AND APPLICABLE TO US MAY DIFFER FROM THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES OR THE BASEL III

FINAL FRAMEWORK AS PUBLISHED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE. THEREFORE, THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS REMAIN UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME.

IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE BASEL COMMITTEE SUPPLEMENTED BASEL III BY ISSUING FINAL PROVISIONS APPLYING A NEW CET1 SURCHARGE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL

SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS (G-SIBS). IN A COMPANION RELEASE ADDRESSING PROGRESS ON A VARIETY

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORMS RELATING TO GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD RELEASED A LIST OF 29 SUCH INSTITUTIONS AND INDICATED THAT IT USED

THE G-SIB SURCHARGE METHODOLOGY IN CREATING THE LIST. THE COMPANY WAS NOT INCLUDED ON EITHER THE ORIGINAL OR REVISED LIST OF G-SIBS RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 2012. WHILE THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES DID NOT ADDRESS THE ADOPTION OF THE SURCHARGE ON

G-SIBS, THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS NOTED THAT THEY PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THIS SURCHARGE FOR INSTITUTIONS WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, OR SOME SUBSET OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS, CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL COMMITTEES G-SIB

SURCHARGE PROPOSAL.

LIQUIDITY RATIOS UNDER BASEL III

HISTORICALLY, REGULATION AND MONITORING OF BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER, BOTH IN

THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, WITHOUT REQUIRED FORMULAIC MEASURES. THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK REQUIRES BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MEASURE THEIR LIQUIDITY AGAINST SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY TESTS THAT, ALTHOUGH SIMILAR IN SOME RESPECTS TO

LIQUIDITY MEASURES HISTORICALLY APPLIED BY BANKS AND REGULATORS FOR MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY PURPOSES, GOING FORWARD WILL BE REQUIRED BY REGULATION. ONE TEST, REFERRED TO AS THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR), IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE

THAT THE BANKING ENTITY MAINTAINS AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS THAT CAN BE CONVERTED INTO CASH TO MEET ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR A 30-DAY TIME HORIZON UNDER A SIGNIFICANTLY SEVERE LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO SPECIFIED BY

SUPERVISORS. THE OTHER TEST, REFERRED TO AS THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (NSFR), IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE MORE MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM FUNDING OF THE ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES OF BANKING ENTITIES OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THESE REQUIREMENTS

WILL INCENT BANKING ENTITIES TO INCREASE THEIR HOLDINGS OF CASH, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND OTHER SOVEREIGN DEBT AS A COMPONENT OF ASSETS AND INCREASE THE USE OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS A FUNDING SOURCE.

THE BASEL III LIQUIDITY FRAMEWORK CONTEMPLATES THAT THE LCR WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BEGINNING WITH 60% COMPLIANCE REQUIRED STARTING ON

JANUARY 1, 2015 WITH THE REMAINING PORTION PHASED-IN OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IN 10% INCREMENTS, REACHING 100% ON JANUARY 1, 2019. THE BASEL III LIQUIDITY FRAMEWORK CONTEMPLATES THAT THE NSFR WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AS A MINIMUM STANDARD BY

JANUARY 1, 2018.

THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE NOT YET PROPOSED RULES IMPLEMENTING THE BASEL III LIQUIDITY

FRAMEWORK FOR U.S. BANKING INSTITUTIONS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVES PROPOSED HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS ALSO INCLUDE ENHANCED LIQUIDITY STANDARDS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER 

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

THE FDIA REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) THAT DO NOT MEET

MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE FDIA SPECIFIES FIVE CAPITAL TIERS: WELL CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, UNDERCAPITALIZED, SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED AND CRITICALLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CAPITAL TIER DEPENDS UPON HOW ITS CAPITAL LEVELS COMPARE TO VARIOUS RELEVANT CAPITAL MEASURES AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS, AS ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION. A BANK MAY BE DEEMED TO BE IN A

CAPITALIZATION CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY ITS ACTUAL CAPITAL POSITION IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY EXAMINATION RATING. ONCE AN INSTITUTION BECOMES UNDERCAPITALIZED, THE FDIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY MORE RESTRICTIVE

CONSTRAINTS ON OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE CAPITAL CATEGORY IN WHICH AN INSTITUTION IS CLASSIFIED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION THAT IS NOT WELL CAPITALIZED IS ALSO SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE ACCEPTANCE OF

BROKERED DEPOSITS INCLUDING CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT REGISTRY SERVICE DEPOSITS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAS BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CHANNELS, AND SUCH DEPOSITS ARE CONSIDERED BROKERED

DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES, ALTHOUGH AS PART OF OUR FUNDING STRATEGY, A MAJORITY OF THE DEPOSITS RAISED DURING 2012 WERE ACCEPTED DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL SAVINGS, A SET OF DEPOSIT PRODUCTS OFFERED BY

AEBFSB. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR DEPOSIT PROGRAMS, SEE DEPOSIT PROGRAMS UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES  CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES ABOVE AND DEPOSIT PROGRAMS ON PAGE 33 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION FROM MAKING ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION (INCLUDING PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS) OR PAYING ANY MANAGEMENT FEE TO ITS HOLDING COMPANY IF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD THEREAFTER BE UNDERCAPITALIZED. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE

SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON BORROWING FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND TO GROWTH LIMITATIONS, AND ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN. FOR A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN TO BE ACCEPTABLE, ANY HOLDING COMPANY MUST GUARANTEE THE CAPITAL PLAN UP TO AN

AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF 5% OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AT THE TIME IT BECAME UNDERCAPITALIZED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL DEFICIENCY AT THE TIME IT FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE PLAN. IN THE EVENT OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS

BANKRUPTCY, SUCH GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY OVER CLAIMS OF ITS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS. IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FAILS TO SUBMIT AN ACCEPTABLE PLAN, IT IS TREATED AS IF IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED.

SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING ORDERS TO

SELL SUFFICIENT VOTING STOCK TO BECOME ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE TOTAL ASSETS AND CESSATION OF RECEIPT OF DEPOSITS FROM CORRESPONDENT BANKS. CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO APPOINTMENT OF A

RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR.

EARLY REMEDIATION REGIME

DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EARLY REMEDIATION REGIME FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. IN JANUARY 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUBLISHED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING THAT INCLUDED A PROPOSED EARLY REMEDIATION SYSTEM BASED IN PART ON THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGIME THAT CURRENTLY APPLIES

TO INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE FDIA. THE PROPOSED RULE, HOWEVER, UTILIZES FORWARD-LOOKING TRIGGERS BASED ON CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE, STRESS TEST REQUIREMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT, LIQUIDITY AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET DATA.

BECAUSE THESE RULES ARE NOT YET FINAL, THEIR ULTIMATE IMPACT ON US IS NOT CERTAIN.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN CENTURION BANK OR

AEBFSB AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING LOANS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM CENTURION BANK

AND AEBFSB) BETWEEN CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THEIR AFFILIATES (INCLUDING THE COMPANY, TRS AND THEIR NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES), ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE SUBJECT TO QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE LIMITATIONS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS,

AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY STATUTE AND FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION. EFFECTIVE JULY 21, 2012, DODD-FRANK SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE COVERAGE AND SCOPE OF THE LIMITATIONS ON AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN A BANKING ORGANIZATION AND CHANGES

THE PROCEDURE FOR SEEKING EXEMPTIONS FROM THESE RESTRICTIONS. TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS. THESE RESTRICTIONS GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ACCEPT DEPOSITS AND THOSE DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE FDICS DEPOSIT

INSURANCE FUND (DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND) IS FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS ON INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO REBUILD THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND, THE FDIC REQUIRED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CENTURION

BANK AND AEBFSB, TO PREPAY THEIR ESTIMATED ASSESSMENTS FOR ALL OF 2010, 2011 AND 2012 ON DECEMBER 30, 2009.

EACH

INSTITUTIONS ASSESSMENTS ARE BASED ON THE AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS LESS THE AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY OF THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD (THE ASSESSMENT BASE). THE ASSESSMENT RATE APPLICABLE

TO LARGE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, IS ADJUSTED BASED UPON THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS RATIO OF (1) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT TO THE ASSESSMENT BASE, (2) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT ISSUED BY

ANOTHER INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO THE ASSESSMENT BASE AND (3) BROKERED DEPOSITS TO THE ASSESSMENT BASE. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR BROKERED DEPOSITS TO THE ASSESSMENT BASE DO NOT APPLY SO LONG AS THE INSTITUTION IS WELL CAPITALIZED AND HAS A

COMPOSITE CAMELS RATING OF 1 OR 2. THE RULES PERMIT THE FDIC TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY ASSESSMENT RATE ADJUSTMENTS.

DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE FDIC TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM RESERVE RATIO FOR THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND OF 1.35% OF ESTIMATED INSURED DEPOSITS BY

SEPTEMBER 30, 2020. ON DECEMBER 20, 2010, THE FDIC ISSUED A FINAL RULE SETTING THE INCREASED RESERVE RATIO AT 2%. THIS RULE REPRESENTS AN INCREASE IN THE RESERVE RATIO AND WILL RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IN

ADDITION, DODD-FRANK ELIMINATED THE CEILING (1.5% OF INSURED DEPOSITS) ON THE SIZE OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND AND MADE THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS FROM THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND BY THE FDIC DISCRETIONARY.

UNDER THE FDIA, THE FDIC MAY TERMINATE THE INSURANCE OF AN INSTITUTIONS DEPOSITS UPON A FINDING THAT THE INSTITUTION HAS ENGAGED IN

UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICES, IS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS, OR HAS VIOLATED ANY APPLICABLE LAW, REGULATION, RULE, ORDER OR CONDITION IMPOSED BY THE FDIC. WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY PRACTICE, CONDITION OR VIOLATION THAT MIGHT

LEAD TO TERMINATION OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE AT EITHER OF OUR INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FDIC POWERS UPON INSOLVENCY OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB, UPON ITS

INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS; (2) TO

ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC

TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IN ADDITION, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A PRIORITY

OVER OTHER GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS AGAINST THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF DEBT HOLDERS OF THE INSTITUTION AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES, IN THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION BY A RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER

OR NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB, THE DEBT HOLDERS AND DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS, IF ANYTHING, THAN THE DEPOSITORS

IN U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY UNDER DODD-FRANK

DODD-FRANK CREATES ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY (OLA), A RESOLUTION REGIME FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT NON-BANK FINANCIAL

COMPANIES, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, UNDER WHICH THE TREASURY SECRETARY MAY APPOINT THE FDIC AS RECEIVER TO LIQUIDATE SUCH A COMPANY IF THE COMPANY IS IN DANGER OF DEFAULT AND PRESENTS A SYSTEMIC RISK TO U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY. THIS

DETERMINATION BY THE TREASURY SECRETARY MUST COME AFTER SUPERMAJORITY RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC AND CONSULTATION BY THE TREASURY SECRETARY WITH THE PRESIDENT. OLA IS SIMILAR TO THE FDIC RESOLUTION MODEL FOR DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING THE VERY BROAD POWERS GRANTED TO THE FDIC AS RECEIVER), WITH CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO REFLECT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES AND TO REDUCE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TREATMENT OF

CREDITORS CLAIMS UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE AND IN AN OLA PROCEEDING AS COMPARED TO DISPARITIES THAT WOULD EXIST IN THE RESOLUTION BY THE FDIC OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. HOWEVER, THE PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE RIGHTS OF

CREDITORS UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY WERE MODIFIED FROM THE FDIA REGIME IN CERTAIN RESPECTS TO REDUCE DISPARITIES WITH THE TREATMENT OF CREDITORS CLAIMS UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE AS COMPARED TO THE TREATMENT OF THOSE CLAIMS

UNDER THE NEW AUTHORITY. NONETHELESS, SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE RIGHTS OF CREDITORS EXIST BETWEEN THESE TWO REGIMES, INCLUDING: THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT PROVISIONS TO DISREGARD THE STRICT PRIORITY OF CREDITOR CLAIMS IN

SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, THE USE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS PROCEDURE TO DETERMINE CREDITORS CLAIMS (AS OPPOSED TO THE JUDICIAL PROCEDURE UTILIZED IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS), AND THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC TO TRANSFER CLAIMS TO A BRIDGE

ENTITY.

AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND WILL FUND OLA LIQUIDATION PROCEEDINGS THROUGH BORROWINGS FROM THE

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY AND RISK-BASED ASSESSMENTS MADE, FIRST, ON ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE MORE IN THE RESOLUTION THAN THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IN LIQUIDATION TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH EXCESS, AND SECOND, IF NECESSARY, ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AND ON CERTAIN OTHER NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES. IF AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION IS TRIGGERED, THE COMPANY COULD FACE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND. IT IS

NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF ANY SUCH FUTURE ASSESSMENTS.

THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY PROVISIONS OF THE

DODD-FRANK ACT BECAME EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT. HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF RULEMAKINGS ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ACT, AND A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS OF THE NEW AUTHORITY REQUIRE CLARIFICATION. THE FDIC HAS COMPLETED ITS INITIAL PHASE OF RULEMAKING

UNDER THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY, BUT MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE. NEW GUIDANCE MAY AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE NEW AUTHORITY IS APPLIED.

CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISIONS

UNDER THE

CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM, RECOVERY AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989 (FIRREA), INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MAY BE LIABLE TO THE FDIC WITH RESPECT TO ANY

LOSS INCURRED OR REASONABLY ANTICIPATED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFAULT OF, OR FDIC ASSISTANCE TO, ANY COMMONLY CONTROLLED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE COMMONLY CONTROLLED WITHIN THE MEANING

OF THE FIRREA CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION.

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE SUBJECT TO THE CRA, WHICH IMPOSES AFFIRMATIVE, ONGOING OBLIGATIONS ON DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MEET THE

CREDIT NEEDS OF THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS, CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFE AND SOUND OPERATION OF THE INSTITUTION. THE CRA REQUIRES AN INSTITUTIONS PRIMARY FEDERAL REGULATOR, AS PART OF THE EXAMINATION

PROCESS, TO ASSESS THE INSTITUTIONS RECORD IN MEETING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CRA, AND ALSO TO TAKE SUCH ASSESSMENT INTO ACCOUNT IN EVALUATING MERGER AND ACQUISITION PROPOSALS AND APPLICATIONS TO OPEN OR RELOCATE A BRANCH OFFICE. AEBFSB WAS

EXAMINED BY THE OCC FOR CRA COMPLIANCE IN NOVEMBER 2012. WE ARE AWAITING THE RESULTS OF THIS EXAMINATION. CENTURION BANK WILL BE EXAMINED BY THE FDIC DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, WITH THE RESULTS TO BE RELEASED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. IN EACH OF

THEIR LAST EXAMINATIONS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB RECEIVED SATISFACTORY CRA RATINGS.

IN THE CASE OF A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY, SUCH AS THE COMPANY AND TRS, APPLYING FOR APPROVAL TO ACQUIRE A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE RECORD OF EACH SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICANT BANK HOLDING COMPANY IN CONSIDERING

THE APPLICATION. IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY CRA RATINGS COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANYS AND TRS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN

ACTIVITIES IN RELIANCE ON FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AUTHORITY.

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION

WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP AND MAKE AVAILABLE RELEVANT, PERSONALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN

CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THEIR INFORMATION, AND WE GIVE THEM NOTICE REGARDING THE MEASURES WE TAKE TO SAFEGUARD THIS INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS.

REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS MEDIA AND PUBLIC FOCUS, IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY

CONTINUES TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE, SPURRED BY ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING MOBILE DEVICES), BROAD USE OF THE INTERNET, EXPANDING USES OF MOBILE COMMERCE AND SOCIAL NETWORKING, AND RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT THE RAPID AND WIDESPREAD COLLECTION,

DISSEMINATION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SECURITY BREACHES AND CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS. OUR REGULATORS, INCLUDING REGULATORY EXAMINERS, ARE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT OUR PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND

INFORMATION SECURITY-RELATED POLICIES AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ACCESS CONTROLS, ARE ADEQUATE TO INFORM CONSUMERS OF OUR DATA COLLECTION, USE, SHARING AND/OR SECURITY PRACTICES, TO PROVIDE THEM WITH CHOICES, IF REQUIRED, ABOUT HOW WE

USE AND SHARE THEIR INFORMATION, AND TO SAFEGUARD THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GLBA IMPOSES CERTAIN

LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SHARE CONSUMERS NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES; REQUIRES THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR DATA COLLECTION,

SHARING AND SECURITY PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS), AND REQUIRES FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES AND THE SENSITIVITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION PROCESSED BY THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE GLBA DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS THAT AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS. VARIOUS STATES ALSO HAVE ADOPTED LAWS, RULES

AND/OR REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO PRIVACY AND/OR INFORMATION SECURITY, INCLUDING CERTAIN POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE FINANCIAL PRIVACY LAWS (SUCH AS A LAW IN EFFECT IN CALIFORNIA); DATA SECURITY AND/OR DATA DISPOSAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING POTENTIALLY

APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED IN STATES SUCH AS MASSACHUSETTS AND NEVADA); ONLINE PRIVACY LAWS (SUCH AS A LAW IN EFFECT IN CALIFORNIA); AND LAWS RELATING TO THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF CERTAIN TYPES OF DATA (SUCH AS LAWS GOVERNING CERTAIN

HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION AND/OR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, FOR WHICH THERE ARE ALSO POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS, AND/OR GUIDANCE AS WELL). CERTAIN OF THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY APPLY TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF OUR

EMPLOYEES AND/OR CONTRACTORS AS WELL AS OUR CUSTOMERS.

VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND 46 U.S. STATES,

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAVE ENACTED DATA SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF INDIVIDUAL, CONSUMER, REGULATOR AND/OR LAW ENFORCEMENT NOTIFICATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE

EVENT OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH. DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION LAWS ARE ALSO BECOMING MORE PREVALENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE OPERATE, INCLUDING JAPAN, SOUTH

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KOREA, TAIWAN, MEXICO AND GERMANY. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND

PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY BREACH NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE DATA SECURITY BREACHES.

WE

ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE (INCLUDING COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, MEXICO, CANADA, JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA), SOME OF WHICH ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE

IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN EUROPE, EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION

DIRECTIVE), WHICH HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 1995, PROVIDES FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA. THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE REQUIRES THE CONTROLLER OF AN

INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STEPS TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. MORE RECENTLY, DIRECTIVE 2009/136/EC (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE E-PRIVACY DIRECTIVE OR

COOKIES DIRECTIVE) INTRODUCED NEW REQUIREMENTS ON THE COLLECTION AND USE OF DATA ABOUT INTERNET USERS AND REQUIRED MEMBER STATES TO ENACT NATIONAL LAWS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS. COMPLIANCE WITH DATA PROTECTION LAWS IN EUROPE AND

ELSEWHERE COULD RESULT IN HIGHER TECHNOLOGY, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS FOR THE COMPANY AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OPTIMIZE THE USE OF OUR CLOSED-LOOP DATA.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RELEASED ON JANUARY 25, 2012 THE TEXT OF ITS DRAFT PROPOSED DATA PROTECTION FRAMEWORK REGULATION TO REPLACE THE EU DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE (95/46/EC). IF ENACTED, IT MAY

AFFECT PARTIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, THAT COLLECT AND/OR PROCESS THE PERSONAL DATA OF RESIDENTS OF MEMBER STATES AND MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND COSTS. THE DRAFT GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION PROPOSES, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, A REQUIREMENT FOR PROMPT NOTICE OF DATA BREACHES, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, TO DATA SUBJECTS AND SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES, APPLYING UNIFORMLY ACROSS SECTORS AND ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION AND PROPOSES SIGNIFICANT FINES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH

THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS REQUIREMENTS. THE PROPOSED REGULATION MAY BE FINALIZED IN LATE 2013 WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE 18-24 MONTHS THEREAFTER.

IN NOVEMBER 2012, WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM OF OUR BINDING CORPORATE RULES (BCR) FOR TRANSFERRING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED IN EUROPEAN

ECONOMIC AREA COUNTRIES TO AMERICAN EXPRESS GROUP COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THIS APPROVAL IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 28, 2013. IT FOLLOWED A CONSULTATION PROCESS BETWEEN THE UK AUTHORITY AND THE DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND

ENABLES US TO PROCEED WITH OBTAINING FORMAL APPROVALS OF OUR BCR FROM AUTHORITIES ACROSS THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA.

WE

CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE PERSONAL INFORMATION ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS, AND OUR INTERNAL PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY-RELATED POLICIES,

INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT OR OTHER FRAUD, WHILE SEEKING TO COLLECT AND USE PERSONAL INFORMATION IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WE ALSO HAVE UNDERTAKEN MEASURES TO ASSESS THE LEVEL

OF ACCESS TO CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE DATA BY OUR EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS.

FAIR CREDIT REPORTING

THE FCRA REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER

CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER COMPANIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, FCRA PLACES RESTRICTIONS (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) ON THE SHARING AND USE OF CERTAIN PERSONAL FINANCIAL AND CREDITWORTHINESS INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WITH AND BY OUR

AFFILIATES.

THE FCRA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED BY THE ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2003 OF THE FACT ACT. THE FACT ACT REQUIRES ANY

COMPANY THAT RECEIVES INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN AFFILIATE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO PERMIT THE CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM HAVING THAT INFORMATION USED TO MARKET THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. IN NOVEMBER 2007,

THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ISSUED A FINAL RULE IMPLEMENTING THE AFFILIATE MARKETING PROVISIONS OF THE FACT ACT. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THESE AGENCIES WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE BY OCTOBER 1, 2008. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED

VARIOUS MECHANISMS TO ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS TO OPT OUT OF AFFILIATE SHARING AND OF MARKETING BY THE COMPANY AND OUR AFFILIATES, AND WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ENHANCE THESE MECHANISMS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS AND

A FAVORABLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.

THE FACT ACT FURTHER AMENDED THE FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT

OR DECREASE IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CONSUMER CREDIT INFORMATION. THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES AND THE FEDERAL TRADE

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMISSION (FTC) PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE IN NOVEMBER 2007 REQUIRING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM CONTAINING REASONABLE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS THE RISK OF

IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IDENTIFY ACCOUNTS WHERE IDENTITY THEFT IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ORIGINALLY WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE BY NOVEMBER 1, 2008, BUT THE FTC SUSPENDED

ENFORCEMENT OF ITS RULE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010 PENDING CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION BY CONGRESS TO CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF ENTITIES COVERED BY THE LAW AND THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. ON DECEMBER 18, 2010, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW

THE RED FLAG PROGRAM CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2010. OUR INTERNAL POLICIES AND STANDARDS, AS WELL AS OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE DATA PROTECTION, INFORMATION SECURITY AND FRAUD PREVENTION PROGRAMS, ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW IDENTITY THEFT REQUIREMENTS.

THE FACT ACT ALSO IMPOSES DUTIES ON BOTH CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND ON BUSINESSES THAT FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION

CONTAINED IN CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FURNISHER OF INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO PREVENT THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE RESULT OF IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO, IF A CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY

OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, THE FURNISHER OF THAT INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A TIMELY FASHION. THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE ISSUED RULES THAT

SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE DISPUTES REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE FACT ACT ALSO REQUIRES GRANTORS OF CREDIT THAT USE

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO OFFER A BORROWER CREDIT ON TERMS THAT ARE MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE TERMS OFFERED TO MOST OF THE LENDERS OTHER CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE BORROWER THAT THE TERMS

ARE BASED ON A CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. IN SUCH A CASE THE BORROWER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES

UNDER WHICH RISK-BASED PRICING NOTICES MUST BE PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS AND THE CONTENT, FORMAT AND TIMING OF SUCH NOTICES. SINCE JULY 21, 2011, DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE ADDITION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT SCORES TO

RISK-BASED PRICING NOTICES AND TO ADVERSE ACTION NOTICES OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY THE FCRA. GRANTORS OF CREDIT USING PRESCREENED CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN CREDIT SOLICITATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO INCLUDE AN ENHANCED NOTICE TO

CONSUMERS THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT FROM RECEIVING FURTHER PRESCREENED OFFERS OF CREDIT. THE ENACTMENT OF THE FACT ACT AND THE PROMULGATION OF RULES IMPLEMENTING IT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR

PRACTICES.

THE CARD ACT

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE LEGISLATION KNOWN AS THE CARD ACT, WHICH WAS ENACTED IN MAY 2009. THE CARD ACT REGULATES CREDIT CARD BILLING PRACTICES, PRICING, DISCLOSURE AND OTHER PRACTICES.

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CARD ACT AND RELATED REGULATIONS PROHIBIT ISSUERS FROM TREATING A PAYMENT AS LATE FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING IMPOSING A PENALTY INTEREST RATE OR LATE FEE, UNLESS A CONSUMER HAS BEEN PROVIDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF

TIME TO MAKE THE PAYMENT. IT ALSO REQUIRES ISSUERS TO APPLY PAYMENT AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM PAYMENT FIRST TO THE BALANCE WITH THE HIGHEST ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES (APRS) AND THEN TO BALANCES WITH LOWER APRS. IN ADDITION,

THE CARD ACT PROHIBITS AN ISSUER FROM INCREASING THE APR ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES, EXCEPT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN A PROMOTIONAL RATE EXPIRES, A VARIABLE RATE ADJUSTS, OR AN ACCOUNT IS SERIOUSLY DELINQUENT OR COMPLETES A WORKOUT

ARRANGEMENT. THE CARD ACT ALSO REQUIRES THAT PENALTY FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL.

THE CARD ACT ALSO REQUIRES ISSUERS

TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE WRITTEN POLICIES TO CONSIDER A CONSUMERS INCOME OR ASSETS AND CURRENT OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO OPENING AN ACCOUNT OR INCREASING A CREDIT LINE. IN ADDITION, APPLICANTS FOR NEW ACCOUNTS WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 21 MUST

DEMONSTRATE AN INDEPENDENT ABILITY TO MAKE THE REQUIRED MINIMUM PERIODIC PAYMENTS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED CLARIFICATIONS TO ITS RULES IMPLEMENTING THE CARD ACT EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2011, WHICH INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT APPLICANTS WHO ARE 21 AND

OVER MUST ALSO DEMONSTRATE AN INDEPENDENT ABILITY TO MAKE THE REQUIRED MONTHLY MINIMUM PAYMENTS AND PROVIDE THAT ISSUERS MAY CONSIDER HOUSEHOLD INCOME OR ASSETS ONLY UNDER SPECIFIC CONDITIONS.

THE CARD ACT REQUIRES ISSUERS TO PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES TO DETERMINE IF A DECREASE IS APPROPRIATE. THE OBLIGATION TO

PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES COMMENCED IN FEBRUARY 2011 AND IS ONGOING.

CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CARD ACT ALSO

APPLY TO STORED VALUE AND PREPAID PRODUCTS SOLD ON OR AFTER AUGUST 22, 2010. IN MARCH 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AMENDED ITS REGULATION E TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE DORMANCY, INACTIVITY OR SERVICE FEES WITH RESPECT TO

GIFT CERTIFICATES, STORE GIFT CARDS AND GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS ISSUED PRIMARILY FOR PERSONAL USE. SUCH FEES MAY ONLY BE IMPOSED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RULES PROHIBIT THE SALE OR ISSUANCE OF

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A GIFT CERTIFICATE, STORE GIFT CARD OR GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARD THAT HAS AN EXPIRATION DATE OF LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AFTER EITHER THE DATE A CERTIFICATE OR CARD IS ISSUED OR THE DATE ON WHICH

FUNDS WERE LAST LOADED. THE RULES ALSO REQUIRE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO GIVE CONSUMERS A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE A CERTIFICATE OR CARD WITH AT LEAST FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE CERTIFICATE OR CARD EXPIRATION DATE, PROHIBIT

ANY FEES FOR REPLACING AN EXPIRED CERTIFICATE OR CARD OR REFUNDING THE REMAINING BALANCE AS LONG AS THE UNDERLYING FUNDS REMAIN VALID, AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR ANY FEE OTHER THAN A DORMANCY, INACTIVITY OR SERVICE FEE.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE

AMERICAN EXPRESS IS SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS AS A RESULT OF BEING A FINANCIAL COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS HAVING A GLOBAL PRESENCE. IN THE

UNITED STATES, THE MAJORITY OF AML REQUIREMENTS IS DERIVED FROM THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS IT HAS BEEN AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT. IN EUROPE, AML REQUIREMENTS ARE LARGELY THE RESULT OF COUNTRIES TRANSPOSING THE 3

RD

EUROPEAN UNION MONEY LAUNDERING DIRECTIVE (AND PRECEDING EU MONEY

LAUNDERING DIRECTIVES) INTO LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE ANTICIPATE THE PASSAGE OF THE 4TH EUROPEAN MONEY LAUNDERING DIRECTIVE IN 2013, WHICH MAY ADD NEW AML REQUIREMENTS. NUMEROUS OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, CANADA, MEXICO AND ARGENTINA,

HAVE ALSO ENACTED OR PROPOSED NEW OR ENHANCED AML LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO AMERICAN EXPRESS.

THE

UNDERPINNINGS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE THE EFFORTS OF EACH GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM FROM BEING USED BY CRIMINALS TO HIDE THEIR ILLICIT PROCEEDS AND TO IMPEDE TERRORISTS ABILITY TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN

SUPPORT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH AML PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, EXPANDED REPORTING, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF

SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS, AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS. ANY ERRORS, FAILURES OR DELAYS IN COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL, STATE OR FOREIGN AML AND COUNTER-TERRORIST FINANCING LAWS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL AND

CIVIL LAWSUITS, PENALTIES AND FORFEITURE OF SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS ESTABLISHED

AND CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY, DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT, AT A MINIMUM, AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ALL OF ITS BUSINESSES ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO AML AND ANTI-TERRORIST

FINANCING INITIATIVES. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY REQUIRES THAT EACH AMERICAN EXPRESS BUSINESS MAINTAINS A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FOR A SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS TO ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE DUE DILIGENCE AND,

WHEN NECESSARY, ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE, INCLUDING OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION, IS CONDUCTED AT ACCOUNT OPENING AND UPDATED, AS NECESSARY, THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP. THE GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

POLICY IS ALSO DESIGNED TO ENSURE THERE ARE APPROPRIATE METHODS OF MONITORING TRANSACTIONS AND ACCOUNT RELATIONSHIPS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY AND REPORTING SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY REQUIRES THE TRAINING OF APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL WITH REGARD TO AML AND ANTI-TERRORIST FINANCING ISSUES AND PROVIDES FOR INDEPENDENT TESTING

TO ENSURE THAT THE GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

OFFICE

OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATION

THE UNITED STATES HAS IMPOSED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THAT AFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH

DESIGNATED FOREIGN COUNTRIES, NATIONALS AND OTHERS. THE UNITED STATES PROHIBITS U.S. PERSONS FROM ENGAGING WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES IDENTIFIED AS SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS, SUCH AS TERRORISTS AND NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. THESE

PROHIBITIONS ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURYS OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC) AND ARE TYPICALLY KNOWN AS THE OFAC RULES. THE OFAC RULES PROHIBIT U.S. PERSONS FROM ENGAGING IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

WITH OR RELATING TO THE PROHIBITED INDIVIDUAL, ENTITY OR COUNTRY, REQUIRE THE BLOCKING OF ASSETS IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL, ENTITY OR COUNTRY HAS AN INTEREST, AND PROHIBIT TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY SUBJECT TO U.S. JURISDICTION (INCLUDING PROPERTY IN

THE POSSESSION OR CONTROL OF U.S. PERSONS) TO SUCH INDIVIDUAL, ENTITY OR COUNTRY. BLOCKED ASSETS (E.G., PROPERTY OR BANK DEPOSITS) CANNOT BE PAID OUT, WITHDRAWN, SET OFF OR TRANSFERRED IN ANY MANNER WITHOUT A LICENSE FROM OFAC. WE MAINTAIN A GLOBAL

SANCTIONS PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH OFAC REQUIREMENTS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS COULD SUBJECT US TO SERIOUS LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPENSATION PRACTICES

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IN JUNE 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC, THE FDIC AND THE

OTS JOINTLY ISSUED FINAL GUIDANCE ON SOUND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES THAT APPLIES TO ALL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS ALL INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. THE FINAL GUIDANCE SETS FORTH THREE KEY PRINCIPLES FOR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE THAT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS DO NOT ENCOURAGE EXCESSIVE RISK-TAKING

AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. THE THREE PRINCIPLES PROVIDE THAT A BANKING ORGANIZATIONS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD (1) PROVIDE INCENTIVES THAT APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND

FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO EXPOSE THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPRUDENT RISKS, (2) BE COMPATIBLE WITH EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT, AND (3) BE SUPPORTED BY STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE,

INCLUDING ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT BY THE ORGANIZATIONS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ANY DEFICIENCIES IN COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF A BANKING INSTITUTION THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE OR OTHER BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES IN CONNECTION

WITH ITS REVIEW OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS COMPENSATION PRACTICES MAY BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISORY RATINGS, WHICH CAN AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR PERFORM OTHER ACTIONS. THE FINAL GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST A BANKING ORGANIZATION IF ITS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATED RISK-MANAGEMENT CONTROL OR GOVERNANCE PROCESSES POSE A RISK TO THE ORGANIZATIONS SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS AND THE ORGANIZATION IS

NOT TAKING PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO CORRECT THE DEFICIENCIES.

ADDITIONALLY, IN 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC,

THE FDIC, THE OTS, THE SEC, THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY AND THE NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION ISSUED PROPOSED RULEMAKING PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK ON INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION PRACTICES. UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, ALL FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $1 BILLION OR MORE (SUCH AS THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM OFFERING INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT ENCOURAGE INAPPROPRIATE RISK TAKING BY OFFERING

EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION OR COMPENSATION THAT COULD LEAD THE COMPANY TO MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS. ALL COVERED INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FEDERAL REGULATORS WITH ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROPOSED

RULE AND ALSO TO MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. ADDITIONALLY, FOR COVERED INSTITUTIONS WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, THE PROPOSED RULE REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST 50% OF CERTAIN

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION BE DEFERRED FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS AND PROVIDES FOR THE ADJUSTMENT OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS TO REFLECT ACTUAL LOSSES OR OTHER MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE THAT BECOME KNOWN DURING THE DEFERRAL

PERIOD. MOREOVER, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF A COVERED INSTITUTION WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS MUST IDENTIFY EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE AUTHORITY TO EXPOSE AN INSTITUTION TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK, EVALUATE AND DOCUMENT THE

INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION METHODS USED TO BALANCE RISK AND FINANCIAL REWARDS FOR THE IDENTIFIED EMPLOYEES, AND APPROVE INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES AFTER APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERING OTHER AVAILABLE METHODS FOR

BALANCING RISK AND FINANCIAL REWARDS. THE FORM AND TIMING OF ANY FINAL RULE CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.

THE SCOPE AND

CONTENT OF THESE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE EVOLVING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME WHETHER COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH POLICIES AND REGULATIONS WILL

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO HIRE, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE ITS AND THEIR KEY EMPLOYEES.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (THE FCPA), THE UK BRIBERY ACT AND OTHER LAWS THAT

PROHIBIT THE MAKING OR OFFERING OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS. THE FCPA MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO CORRUPTLY OFFER OR PROVIDE ANYTHING OF VALUE TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, POLITICAL PARTIES OR POLITICAL PARTY OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING

BUSINESS OR AN IMPROPER ADVANTAGE. THE ANTI-BRIBERY PROVISIONS OF THE FCPA ARE ENFORCED BY DOJ. THE FCPA ALSO REQUIRES US TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH CERTAIN ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROLS STANDARDS, WHICH ARE ENFORCED BY THE SEC. IN RECENT YEARS, DOJ

AND SEC ENFORCEMENT OF THE FCPA HAS BECOME MORE INTENSE. THE UK BRIBERY ACT, WHICH TOOK EFFECT IN JULY 2011, ALSO PROHIBITS COMMERCIAL BRIBERY, AND THE RECEIPT OF A BRIBE, AND MAKES IT A CORPORATE OFFENSE TO FAIL TO PREVENT BRIBERY BY AN ASSOCIATED

PERSON, IN ADDITION TO PROHIBITING IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE FCPA, THE UK BRIBERY ACT AND OTHER LAWS CAN EXPOSE US AND/OR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES TO POTENTIALLY SEVERE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES.

THE RISK MAY BE GREATER WHEN WE TRANSACT BUSINESS, WHETHER THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES OR JOINT VENTURES OR OTHER PARTNERSHIPS, IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER PERCEIVED LEVELS OF CORRUPTION. WE HAVE RISK-BASED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO DETECT AND DETER

PROHIBITED

PRACTICES, PROVIDE SPECIALIZED TRAINING, MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS AND PAYMENTS, AND INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPRIETIES RELATING TO TRANSACTIONS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED. HOWEVER, IF OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS GOVERNING OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, MAY FACE INVESTIGATIONS OR PROSECUTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOREIGN

OPERATIONS

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS, TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL

AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SEE NOTE 25 TO OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON PAGES 108-110 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.) OUR REVENUES CAN BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THESE

COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN A

CURRENCY OTHER THAN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCY, AND FOR THE REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES). SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF

THE CARD IN CONNECTION WITH SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE

POSSIBILITY THAT, BECAUSE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR MAY BE REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESS THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY ARE

CURRENTLY RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE PURCHASE BY CARDMEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE

CURRENCY OF A TRAVELERS CHEQUE DENOMINATED IN A SECOND CURRENCY; AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS, UNLESS PROPERLY MONITORED AND MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON

HOW WE MANAGE RISK RELATING TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS ON PAGES 39-40 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

(A)

THE INCREASE IN NON-PERFORMING LOANS BETWEEN 2009 AND 2010 WAS DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RELATED TO TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND CONSOLIDATION OF

VIES, WHICH RESULTED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE LENDING TRUST BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010. AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES, AMOUNTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES FOR BOTH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

ISSUANCE TRUST (THE CHARGE TRUST) AND THE LENDING TRUST; CORRESPONDINGLY, 2009 AND 2008 AMOUNTS ONLY INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES FOR THE CHARGE TRUST AND THE SELLERS INTEREST PORTION OF THE LENDING TRUST.

(B)

THE COMPANYS POLICY IS GENERALLY TO CEASE ACCRUING INTEREST INCOME ONCE A RELATED CARDMEMBER LOAN IS 180 DAYS PAST DUE AT WHICH TIME THE CARDMEMBER LOAN IS

WRITTEN OFF. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES LOAN LOSS RESERVES FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE INTEREST RECEIVABLE BALANCES PRIOR TO WRITE-OFF. FOR THE U.S., AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THESE AMOUNTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN CARDMEMBER LOANS PLACED WITH

OUTSIDE COLLECTION AGENCIES.

(C)

REPRESENTS MODIFICATION PROGRAMS CLASSIFIED AS TDRS, WHEREIN THE TERMS OF A LOAN OR RECEIVABLE HAVE BEEN MODIFIED FOR CARDMEMBERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES AND A CONCESSION HAS BEEN GRANTED TO THE BORROWER. SUCH MODIFICATIONS TO THE LOANS AND RECEIVABLES MAY INCLUDE (I) REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE (AS LOW AS ZERO PERCENT, IN WHICH CASE THE LOAN IS CHARACTERIZED AS NON-ACCRUAL IN THE

ACCORDANCE WITH THE MODIFICATION AGREEMENT WITH THE CARDMEMBER, LOANS REVERT BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS (INCLUDING THEIR CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE) WHEN THE CARDMEMBER EXITS THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM, EITHER (I) WHEN ALL PAYMENTS

HAVE BEEN MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MODIFICATION AGREEMENT OR (II) THE CARDMEMBER DEFAULTS OUT OF THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM.

POTENTIAL PROBLEM RECEIVABLES

THIS DISCLOSURE PRESENTS OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS AS WELL AS SPECIFIC RESERVES FOR CERTAIN RECEIVABLES WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT POSSIBLE CREDIT PROBLEMS OF BORROWERS CAUSES MANAGEMENT TO HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS AS

TO THE ABILITY OF SUCH BORROWERS TO COMPLY WITH THE PRESENT REPAYMENT TERMS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEM LOANS OR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THE CARDMEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO THAT WERE NOT

ALREADY INCLUDED IN RISK ELEMENTS ABOVE.

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS (FFIEC) GUIDELINES

GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE FFIEC GUIDELINES FOR ITS CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE STARTING WITH 2009 REPORTING.

THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND GUIDE 3 GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE ARE: I) AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE REPORTED BASED ON AMORTIZED COST FOR FFIEC INSTEAD

OF FAIR VALUE FOR GUIDE 3; II) NET LOCAL COUNTRY CLAIMS ARE REDUCED BY LOCAL COUNTRY LIABILITIES (REGARDLESS OF CURRENCY DENOMINATION) EXCLUDING ANY DEBT THAT IS FUNDING THE LOCAL ASSETS THROUGH A FOREIGN DOMICILED SUBSIDIARY FOR FFIEC COMPARED TO

GUIDE 3 WHERE ONLY AMOUNTS IN THE SAME CURRENCIES ARE OFFSET AND SUCH DEBT NOTED ABOVE IS A REDUCTION TO LOCAL COUNTRY CLAIMS; III) THE FFIEC METHODOLOGY INCLUDES MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURES OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED UNDER GUIDE 3; AND

IV) INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE INCLUDED UNDER FFIEC BUT EXCLUDED UNDER GUIDE 3.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE

PRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS FROM BORROWERS OR COUNTERPARTIES FOR EACH FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT EXCEEDS 1 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS FOR ANY OF THE PERIODS REPORTED BELOW. CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS INCLUDE LOANS,

RECEIVABLES, INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS WITH OTHER BANKS, OTHER INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS AND OTHER MONETARY ASSETS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN EITHER DOLLARS OR OTHER NON-LOCAL CURRENCY.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

THIS SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED

TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS

DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE BUSINESS AND

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. ONGOING CONCERNS OVER ELEVATED LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT,

EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT, BUDGET DISCUSSIONS IN WASHINGTON, DECELERATING GROWTH IN CHINA AND GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES CONTINUE TO IMPACT GLOBAL ECONOMIES AND MARKETS. THIS ENVIRONMENT AND THE UNCERTAIN EXPECTATIONS FOR AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAVE HAD, AND

MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE VERY DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR. A PROLONGED PERIOD OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH OR DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD CHANGE CUSTOMER BEHAVIORS FURTHER. FOR

EXAMPLE, CARDMEMBERS COULD DECIDE TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS AT ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS TO REPLACE EXPENDITURES USING OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT.

FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING, BUSINESS INVESTMENT, GOVERNMENT SPENDING, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, THE VOLATILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INFLATION ALL

AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, OUR PROFITABILITY. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER FAMILY INCOME, LOWER CORPORATE EARNINGS, LOWER BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING IS

LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE MAY CAUSE OUR EARNINGS, CREDIT METRICS AND MARGINS TO FLUCTUATE AND DIVERGE FROM EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS

AND INVESTORS, WHO MAY HAVE DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THEIR IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, AND MAY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES.

POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY OF

CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL

ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $4.5 BILLION OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012. IN THE EVENT THAT ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES OF THESE INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE FROM HISTORICAL PATTERNS DUE TO CHALLENGES IN THE ECONOMY OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE VALUE

OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS, COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) WERE TO PERSIST OR WORSEN, WE COULD EXPERIENCE

CONTINUING OR INCREASED ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL.

THE

GLOBAL MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS, WHILE DEMONSTRATING GENERALLY IMPROVED CONDITIONS, REMAIN SUSCEPTIBLE TO VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS.

70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE NEED LIQUIDITY TO PAY MERCHANTS, OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST ON DEBT AND DIVIDENDS ON

CAPITAL STOCK AND TO REPAY MATURING LIABILITIES. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WE COULD BE FORCED TO LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY ARE PAYMENTS FROM CARDMEMBERS AND

MERCHANTS, CASH FLOW FROM OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ASSETS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF CASH OR ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH, DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY SOURCED DEPOSITS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES AND

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, SECURITIZED BORROWINGS THROUGH OUR SECURED FINANCING FACILITIES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW AND LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITIES. POLICIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS REGARDING BANKING,

MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES INTENDED TO PROMOTE OR MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY AND/OR STABILIZE FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON INVESTOR

DEMAND. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION, WE ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM PRESSURES EXPERIENCED BROADLY ACROSS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE FRAGILITY OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HAVE IMPACTED FINANCIAL

SERVICES COMPANIES. ALTHOUGH THE MARKET FOR OUR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS HAS IMPROVED, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE MARKETS WILL BE OPEN TO US IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, RECENT CONCERNS REGARDING U.S. DEBT AND BUDGET MATTERS

AND THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN EUROPE HAVE CAUSED UNCERTAINTY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. A FURTHER DOWNGRADE OF U.S. DEBT RATINGS IN THE FUTURE COULD, IN ADDITION TO CAUSING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS, MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, AS WELL AS HAVE OTHER MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION. THE IMPACT OF THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS IN EUROPE ON FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN EUROPE AND GLOBALLY COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY. IN ADDITION, OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION WILL BE IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES WITH RESPECT TO THE MAINTENANCE AND GROWTH OF OUR

DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY SOURCED DEPOSIT PROGRAMS. WE ALSO WOULD HAVE LESS FLEXIBILITY IN ACCESSING THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AS A SHORT-TERM FUNDING VEHICLE IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNGRADE IN CREDCOS SHORT-TERM DEBT RATING AND VOLATILITY IN THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET GENERALLY.

IN THE EVENT THAT CURRENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING INTERNAL SOURCES, DO NOT SATISFY

OUR NEEDS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING. THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET CONDITIONS, THE GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND CONSUMER DEPOSITS, THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY

OF CREDIT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, NEW REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS, OUR CREDIT RATINGS (WHICH WERE DOWNGRADED IN APRIL 2009 BY TWO OF THE MAJOR RATINGS AGENCIES) AND CREDIT CAPACITY, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LENDERS OR

DEPOSITORS COULD DEVELOP A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF OUR LONG- OR SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL PROSPECTS IF WE INCUR LARGE CREDIT LOSSES OR IF THE LEVEL OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY DECREASES DUE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS SINCE THE LATTER HALF OF 2009, IF THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CHARGE CARD AND CREDIT CARD

PORTFOLIOS WERE TO WEAKEN THROUGH INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND WRITE-OFFS, OUR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR COST OF CAPITAL COULD INCREASE.

DISRUPTIONS, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE, IN A TIMELY MANNER, MATURING LIABILITIES,

SATISFY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY RAISING CAPITAL OR BEAR AN UNATTRACTIVE COST TO RAISE CAPITAL, WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. IF LEVELS OF MARKET DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE EFFECT, WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL, ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE FINANCIAL

REVIEW  FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 32-35 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

WE CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ROUTINE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE

INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES.

DEFAULTS OR NON-PERFORMANCE BY, OR EVEN RUMORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT, ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS, OR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, HAVE LED TO MARKET-WIDE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND COULD LEAD TO LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY ONE OR

MORE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANY REDUCTION IN THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE THE COST

OF OUR FUNDING FROM, AND RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO, THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM DEBT IS CURRENTLY RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES, THE RATINGS OF THAT DEBT WERE DOWNGRADED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2009 BY MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES (MOODYS) AND STANDARD & POORS (S&P), TWO OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. THE RATING AGENCIES REGULARLY EVALUATE THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR

RATINGS OF THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS FACTORS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THEIR CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, AND THE WIDER STATE OF THE ECONOMY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT RESPECTIVE RATINGS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THOSE RATINGS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER TERMS UPON WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN FUNDING.

WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ACTIONS RATING AGENCIES MAY TAKE. AS WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AT ANY TIME

AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BY ANY OF THE RATING AGENCIES.

ADVERSE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CONTINUED CONCERNS

REGARDING EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT AND THE CONTINUATION OF THE EURO AS A CURRENCY COULD DECREASE EARNINGS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND IMPACT OUR CAPITAL.

DURING 2012, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WERE GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE

ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO

U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CONCERNS PERSIST REGARDING THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO CONTINUE TO SERVICE THEIR SOVEREIGN DEBT OBLIGATIONS, THE OVERALL

STABILITY OF THE EURO AND THE SUITABILITY OF THE EURO AS A SINGLE CURRENCY GIVEN THE DIVERSE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN INDIVIDUAL EUROZONE COUNTRIES. THESE CONCERNS MAY CAUSE THE VALUE OF THE EURO TO FLUCTUATE MORE WIDELY THAN IN THE

PAST AND COULD LEAD TO THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL CURRENCIES IN ONE OR MORE EUROZONE COUNTRIES, OR, IN MORE EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POSSIBLE DISSOLUTION OF THE EURO CURRENCY ENTIRELY. IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATION OF THE EURO AND

WE ARE UNABLE TO HEDGE OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE TO THE EURO, THE VALUE OF OUR EURO-DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WOULD BE CORRESPONDINGLY REDUCED WHEN TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR INCLUSION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SIMILARLY, THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY CURRENCIES OR THE COMPLETE DISSOLUTION OF THE EURO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR EURO-DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE RE-INTRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY

CURRENCIES WOULD REQUIRE US TO RECONFIGURE OUR BILLING AND OTHER SYSTEMS TO REFLECT INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY CURRENCIES IN PLACE OF THE EURO. IMPLEMENTING SUCH CHANGES COULD BE COSTLY AND FAILURES IN THE CURRENCY RECONFIGURATION COULD CAUSE DISRUPTIONS IN

OUR NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE OUR MARKET EXPOSURE TO RE-INTRODUCED CURRENCIES MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US.

THE POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING EUROPE AND THE EURO, OR MARKET PERCEPTIONS CONCERNING THESE AND RELATED ISSUES, COULD CONTINUE TO

HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR IN EUROPE AND GLOBALLY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, CONCERNS OVER THE EFFECT OF THIS

FINANCIAL CRISIS ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN EUROPE AND GLOBALLY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS

ONGOING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING THE COMPANYS NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS PROVISIONS IN MERCHANT CONTRACTS COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO THOSE PROVISIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A

MATERIAL LOSS OF REVENUE OR INCREASED EXPENSES, SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY JUDGMENTS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE COMPANYS GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND.

THE DOJ AND CERTAIN STATES ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THE COMPANYS CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT

MERCHANTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE COMPANYS CARD PRODUCTS AT THE POINT OF SALE VIOLATE THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH WERE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN THE DOJ AND STATE ACTION, ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AND HAVE BEEN

DISMISSED AS PARTIES PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE COURT. THE SETTLEMENT ENJOINS VISA AND MASTERCARD FROM ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO STEER CARDHOLDERS TO OTHER CARD

PRODUCTS OR PAYMENT FORMS AT THE POINT OF SALE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSED CLASS ACTIONS FILED BY MERCHANTS THAT CHALLENGE THE COMPANYS NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS PROVISIONS

IN ITS MERCHANT CONTRACTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS CONTAINED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE COMPANY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF

THE COMPANY, REQUIRE IT TO CHANGE ITS MERCHANT AGREEMENTS IN A WAY THAT COULD EXPOSE THE COMPANYS CARD PRODUCTS TO STEERING, SELECTIVE ACCEPTANCE OR OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AT THE POINT OF SALE THAT WOULD IMPAIR OUR CARDMEMBERS

EXPERIENCE, THREATEN THE IMPOSITION OF SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES, AND/OR DAMAGE THE COMPANYS GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND. EVEN IF THE COMPANY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO CHANGE ITS MERCHANT AGREEMENTS, CHANGES IN VISAS AND MASTERCARDS

POLICIES OR PRACTICES AS A RESULT OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, LAWSUIT SETTLEMENTS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS PROFITABILITY.

THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DODD-FRANK, AS WELL AS REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER, MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY, FOR EXAMPLE, REQUIRING US TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, REQUIRING US TO COMPLY WITH MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS,

LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US (INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INCREASED COSTS OF FUNDING RAISED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), LIMITING THE FEES WE CAN CHARGE FOR

SERVICES, IMPACTING THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, AND INCREASING OUR COLLATERAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS ON INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS WE ENTER. A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IS

CONTAINED IN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE THE COMPANY AND TRS ARE LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND

ACTIVITIES  HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

DODD-FRANK HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CFPB. THE CFPB HAS BROAD RULEMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT

AUTHORITY OVER PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS AND PAYMENT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND AUTHORITY TO PREVENT UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE PRACTICES. THE CFPB HAS THE AUTHORITY TO WRITE REGULATIONS UNDER FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

LAWS, AND TO ENFORCE THOSE LAWS AGAINST AND EXAMINE FOR COMPLIANCE LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IT IS ALSO AUTHORIZED TO COLLECT FINES AND REQUIRE CONSUMER RESTITUTION IN THE EVENT OF VIOLATIONS, ENGAGE

IN CONSUMER FINANCIAL EDUCATION, TRACK CONSUMER COMPLAINTS, REQUEST DATA AND PROMOTE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED CONSUMERS AND COMMUNITIES. OUR COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS TO THE COMPANY

AND MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ATTENTION FROM THE COMPANYS SENIOR MANAGEMENT. LIKEWISE, ANY FAILURE TO FOLLOW SUCH REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN RESTITUTION TO CARDMEMBERS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS, INCLUDING CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES. IN ADDITION TO

INCREASING OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS, CFPB OVERSIGHT HAS RESULTED, AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT, IN CHANGES TO PRICING, PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES AND MAY POTENTIALLY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO MARKETPLACE CHANGES. SUCH CHANGES COULD

MAKE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE TO CONSUMERS AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OFFER THEM PROFITABLY. SUCH CHANGES COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BRAND AND REPUTATION. SEE 

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS

COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES

 BELOW.

MANY PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK, INCLUDING NUMEROUS PROVISIONS NOT DESCRIBED ABOVE, REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF RULES TO IMPLEMENT. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK MANDATES MULTIPLE STUDIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN

ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACTION. THEREFORE, THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DODD-FRANK AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REMAIN UNCERTAIN.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BECAME BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL REGULATION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TWO U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR NON-BANKING ACTIVITIES, INVESTMENTS AND

ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVES REGULATIONS.

BANKING REGULATIONS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROTECT

DEPOSITORS FUNDS, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS AND THE BANKING SYSTEM AS A WHOLE, AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE

ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE MAY BE RESTRICTED IN OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CERTAIN CAPITAL ACTIONS (SUCH AS DECLARING DIVIDENDS OR REPURCHASING

OUTSTANDING SHARES) OR ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR ACQUISITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR BANKING REGULATORS HAVE WIDE DISCRETION IN THE EXAMINATION AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE BANKING STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, AND MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO

ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR ACQUISITIONS, OR MAY REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN MORE CAPITAL.

IN ADDITION TO THE REGULATORY RISKS

DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, BOTH AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND OTHERWISE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS A RESULT OF REGULATORS

ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, REQUIRED TO PAY RESTITUTION, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECTED TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR

SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. REGULATORY ACTION COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND AND ANY CHANGE TO OUR

BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT MAKES OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE TO OUR CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND

UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THERE IS ALSO THE RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE IMPOSED, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR ALTER OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS,

AFFECT RETENTION OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, OR EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS (INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS). SUCH CHANGES ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES AND COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2009 REQUIRED US TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO MANY OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING MARKETING,

UNDERWRITING, PRICING AND BILLING. WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO CARD PRODUCT TERMS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH, AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY, THE CARD ACT; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH CHANGES WILL

CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN THE EVENT THE CARD ACT CONSTRAINS OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO ECONOMIC, MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR REVENUE AND NET INCOME.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT, AND IN SOME CASES, LESS STRINGENT, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REGIMES. THE MORE

RESTRICTIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US CAN PUT US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE AND NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, INCLUDING PROHIBITING US FROM ENGAGING

IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, MAKING THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MORE EXPENSIVE OR ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR COST STRUCTURE.

SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR

REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES.

BUSINESSES IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN SUBJECT TO

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND PATENT CLAIMS. MANY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.

WE MAY ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE OUR PRICING, PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES IN RESPONSE TO PENDING OR FUTURE LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION. THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF ADDITIONAL REGULATION, INCREASED REGULATORY COMPLIANCE EFFORTS AND ENHANCED

REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE COSTS AND MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE PROVIDING CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN OCTOBER 2012, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE REACHED SETTLEMENTS WITH SEVERAL BANK REGULATORS TO RESOLVE REVIEWS OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR U.S. CONSUMER CARD PRACTICES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN CONSUMER

PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS. SIMILAR SETTLEMENTS WERE REACHED WITH SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB AND TRS. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITIES AGREED TO PAY CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES TOTALING $27.5 MILLION AND WE, THROUGH

OUR SUBSIDIARIES, ESTABLISHED A RESTRICTED FUND POOL TOTALING $85 MILLION FOR CUSTOMER REFUNDS (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT DEPENDING ON THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF THE REFUNDS). THE MAJORITY OF THOSE REFUNDS ARE RELATED TO DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES AND LATE

FEE CHARGES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENTS, ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORS AND OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEWS, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE AND CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES TO CERTAIN OF OUR CARD PRACTICES AND PRODUCTS, WHICH HAVE RESULTED, AND

ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT, IN ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION TO CARDMEMBERS AND MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REGULATORY ACTIONS, WHICH COULD INCLUDE CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES. FURTHER ACTION BY THE CFPB OR OTHER BANKING REGULATORS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

REPUTATIONAL HARM OR FINES, OR MAY PREVENT US FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PERMITTED.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES, AND IF WE FAIL TO MEET THESE RULES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

UNDER REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MUST MEET RULES FOR CAPITAL ADEQUACY

AND LEVERAGE RATIOS THAT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. AS DISCUSSED IN FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL ADEQUACY UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE, THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY AND TRS AS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TRANSITION TO BASEL II AND AS A RESULT OF BASEL III AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF DODD-FRANK. IF THE COMPANY, TRS OR OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS FAIL TO MEET CURRENT OR FUTURE MINIMUM CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR OTHER FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN LIGHT OF RECENT MARKET EVENTS, DODD-FRANK AND BASEL III, THE

COMPANY, TRS AND OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY ADDITIONAL, MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS THAN IN THE PAST. WE CANNOT FULLY PREDICT THE FINAL FORM OF, OR THE EFFECTS OF, THESE REGULATIONS. FAILURE

BY ANY OF THE COMPANY, TRS OR A U.S. SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO MAINTAIN ITS RESPECTIVE STATUS AS WELL CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED, IF UNREMEDIED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, COULD COMPROMISE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND

COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PAY COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS, SEE

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL ADEQUACY UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR CAPITAL STOCK.

WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS BY OUR REGULATORS WHO COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN UNSAFE OR

UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF EARNINGS, AND ONLY IF PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

ORGANIZATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT CAPITAL PLANS THAT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROJECTED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR REVIEW. GUIDANCE

FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE STATES THAT OUR DIVIDEND POLICIES WILL BE ASSESSED AGAINST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE BASEL III CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS. A COMPANY THAT HAS NOT ACHIEVED BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON A FULLY

PHASED-IN BASIS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY INCREASING DIVIDENDS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE COMPANYS CAPITAL ADEQUACY BASED ON CAPITAL PLANS

WE SUBMITTED AS DISCUSSED IN FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL PLANNING UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE. WHILE THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT, HAD REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING BASEL III BEEN IN PLACE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, THE COMPANYS CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL III WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THIS

ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. WHILE WE EXPECT TO MEET THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUSIVE OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, AS PHASED IN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY

DIFFERENT FROM BOTH THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES AND THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK AS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2010. MOREOVER, GIVEN THAT THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE DELAYED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED BASEL III RULES, IT CANNOT BE CERTAIN

WHEN IN THE FINAL RULE AS ADOPTED WILL BE APPLICABLE TO US. CONSEQUENTLY, IT REMAINS UNCERTAIN HOW THE FINAL BASEL III RULES, AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES, WILL AFFECT THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. ADDITIONALLY, STRESS TESTING

REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO COMPLY WITH THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OR POTENTIALLY EVEN GREATER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, SOONER THAN EXPECTED.

DURING 2012, WE REPURCHASED 69 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ON JANUARY 7, 2013, WE

SUBMITTED OUR CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE REQUESTING APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2013. THE PLAN INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE AND CAPITAL AVAILABILITY UNDER CERTAIN ADVERSE ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS. WE EXPECT A

RESPONSE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BY MARCH 14, 2013. NO ADDITIONAL SHARES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPURCHASED PRIOR TO ITS RESPONSE. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL APPROVE ADDITIONAL SHARE PURCHASES.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR LIQUIDITY, AND FEDERAL AND STATE LAW LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS

THAT OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY PAY TO THE PARENT COMPANY. LIMITATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES COULD ALSO REDUCE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON BANK HOLDING COMPANY DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY

STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  DIVIDENDS ABOVE, AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS ON PAGE 31 AND NOTE 23 ON PAGES 106-107 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE

SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND REVENUES THROUGH OUR NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING AND CARD ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS A

PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAMS. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. IN ADDITION, MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE FOR ELECTRONIC

PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS, THAT PUT IN PLACE A COMMON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. THE DIRECTIVE IS NOW

UNDERGOING REVIEW AND FURTHER CHANGES, AS YET TO BE DEFINED, ARE ANTICIPATED.

VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES AND LEGISLATURES

ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THESE

NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF

LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED-VALUE CARDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD

NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS IN FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS SUCH AS VISA

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND MASTERCARD AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND, ITALY, SWITZERLAND, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA,

BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED INTERCHANGE FEE INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE ONGOING, CONCLUDED OR ON APPEAL. IN SOME CASES THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE LED TO CHANGES IN NETWORK RULES, SUCH AS NON-DISCRIMINATION AND

HONOR-ALL-CARD PROVISIONS.

THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD

ISSUING BANK IN FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT

HAVE SUCH INTERCHANGE FEES. FOR THIS REASON, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS, THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON THESE NETWORKS. HOWEVER, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING

TO MERCHANT PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. AMONG OTHER IMPACTS, LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL

AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM

RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARDS, SO LONG AS SUCH OFFERS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER.

FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO ESTABLISH

MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED TO ESTABLISH

MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS LAW, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS

OF PAYMENT, SUCH AS DEBIT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

IN EUROPE, SOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS

ITALY AND POLAND HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED REGULATION OF INTERCHANGE OR MERCHANT FEES. IN JANUARY 2012, THE EC PUBLISHED A GREEN PAPER (A DOCUMENT TO BEGIN A PROCESS OF CONSULTATION TOWARD POTENTIAL REGULATION) COVERING A RANGE OF ISSUES AFFECTING

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE GREEN PAPER CONTEMPLATES DIRECT REGULATION OF INTERCHANGE FEES AS WELL AS CHANGES TO NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS RULES AND TO REGULATION OF SURCHARGING. OTHER ISSUES COVERED IN THE GREEN PAPER INCLUDE SEPARATION

OF PROCESSING FROM CARD NETWORK MANAGEMENT, PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO CROSS-BORDER ACQUIRING, MOBILE PAYMENTS AND TECHNICAL STANDARDIZATION. THE EC HAS COMPLETED A CONSULTATION PERIOD AND IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE ITS PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS IN EARLY OF

2013. THESE CONCLUSIONS MAY INVOLVE PROPOSALS FOR REGULATION OR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SELF-REGULATION AND COULD TAKE ANOTHER 18-24 MONTHS TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT. SEE 

AN INCREASING PREVALENCE OF SURCHARGING BY MERCHANTS COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 BELOW.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON THE COMPANY, SUCH AS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR NETWORKS OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUES FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE

LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BUSINESS PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF

OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE

RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE

NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR CARDS, NETWORKS AND OTHER SERVICES. BECAUSE OF EVOLVING PAYMENTS TECHNOLOGIES AND THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, WE MAY NOT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BE

SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING OR MAINTAINING OUR SHARE OF ONLINE SPENDING AND ENHANCING OUR CARDMEMBERS DIGITAL EXPERIENCE, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. WE ALSO EXPECT INCREASED REGULATORY AND LEGAL SCRUTINY

AND REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION IN CONNECTION WITH THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE OR ACCESS COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY BE LIMITED BY PATENT RIGHTS THAT

THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE

77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS, BY RESISTANCE TO CHANGE FROM CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS, BY THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR SYSTEMS OR BY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS,

TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION. THESE MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND A RESULTING LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION,

COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS, PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE,

AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT A FUTURE ASSERTION OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST US WILL NOT CAUSE US TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE,

ROYALTY OR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES.

REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, INFORMATION

SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND AFFECT OR LIMIT HOW WE COLLECT AND/OR USE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS APPLICABLE PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THEM.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT AND IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GLBA IMPOSES CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO

SHARE CONSUMERS NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES; REQUIRES THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR DATA COLLECTION, SHARING AND SECURITY PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS

THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS); AND REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN

COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF CUSTOMER

INFORMATION PROCESSED BY THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE GLBA AND VARIOUS STATE LAWS, SEE PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES, STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS HAVE ENACTED DATA SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION

REQUIREMENTS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF INDIVIDUAL, CONSUMER, REGULATORY AND/OR LAW ENFORCEMENT NOTIFICATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. MANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS ALSO APPLY BROADLY TO MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AND

OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE DATA SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE

VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE DATA SECURITY BREACHES.

IN ADDITION, LEGISLATORS AND/OR REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES

AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE INCREASINGLY ADOPTING OR REVISING PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION

SECURITY-RELATED PRACTICES, OUR COLLECTION, USE, SHARING, RETENTION AND SAFEGUARDING OF CONSUMER AND/OR EMPLOYEE INFORMATION, AND SOME OF OUR CURRENT OR PLANNED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THIS ALSO COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND BUSINESS

OPERATIONS AND COULD REDUCE REVENUES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS INITIATIVES. THERE IS ALSO INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF DATA PROTECTION, PRIVACY AND/OR INFORMATION SECURITY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, DURING 2012 THE FTC AND THE WHITE HOUSE ISSUED REPORTS PERTAINING TO CONSUMER PRIVACY. THE FTCS

REPORT, WHICH APPLIES TO A COMPANYS COLLECTION AND USE OF CONSUMER INFORMATION BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE, INDICATES CERTAIN PRIVACY PRINCIPLES THAT AT LEAST ONE KEY U.S. REGULATOR (THE FTC) EXPECTS COMPANIES TO ADHERE TO AS BEST

PRACTICES. THESE INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN (I.E. BUILDING REASONABLE PROTECTIONS INTO DATA COLLECTION, RETENTION, AND MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES). THE WHITE HOUSE REPORT SETS ADMINISTRATION

POSITIONS, INCLUDING CALLING ON CONGRESS TO ENACT NEW CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO COMMERCIAL DATA PRACTICES IN THE FORM OF A CONSUMER PRIVACY BILL OF RIGHTS AND A NATIONAL DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION STANDARD THAT PREEMPTS THE

EXISTING PATCHWORK OF STATE STANDARDS. IN RECENT YEARS THERE ALSO HAS BEEN INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BY THE FTC, AS WELL AS

INCREASED PRIVACY-RELATED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY AT THE STATE LEVEL, INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA, SUCH AS WITH REGARD TO MOBILE APPLICATIONS. THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATE CONSIDERED A NUMBER OF DRAFT PRIVACY, SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION,

CYBERSECURITY AND

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INFORMATION-SECURITY RELATED BILLS DURING THE 112TH CONGRESS AND VARIOUS COMMITTEE HEARINGS WERE HELD ON RELATED SUBJECTS. THERE ALSO CONTINUES TO BE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THESE AREAS AT THE

STATE LEVEL.

IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE, WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN

INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS IN MEMBER STATES. AS THESE LAWS ARE INTERPRETED THROUGHOUT THE

EUROPEAN UNION, COMPLIANCE COSTS ARE INCREASING, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING THAT ADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION AND DATA TRANSFER MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSED IN JANUARY 2012 A NEW REGULATION TO REPLACE THE

CURRENT DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WOULD TIGHTEN DATA PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND MAKE ENFORCEMENT MORE RIGOROUS, FOR EXAMPLE, BY STREAMLINING ENFORCEMENT AT A EUROPEAN LEVEL, INTRODUCING DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION

REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASING PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. THE PROPOSED REGULATION MAY BE FINALIZED IN LATE 2013 WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE 18-24 MONTHS THEREAFTER. THIS PROPOSED REGULATION FOLLOWS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNIONS

E-PRIVACY DIRECTIVE, WHICH IMPOSES CONSENT REQUIREMENTS ON THE USE OF COOKIES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES SUCH AS ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISEMENT.

COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS (INCLUDING THOSE REGARDING SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION) AFFECTING CUSTOMER AND/OR EMPLOYEE DATA TO WHICH WE ARE

SUBJECT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY EXPLOIT OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITY OR PROVIDE CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS COULD RESULT IN POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY AND/OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR ACTIONS, LITIGATION, FINES, SANCTIONS AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND

OUR BRAND.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY

PERSONNEL. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A CRITICAL PERIOD OF COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND

PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE MARKET FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR CANDIDATES TO REPLACE OR SUCCEED MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. AS

FURTHER DESCRIBED IN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  COMPENSATION PRACTICES ABOVE, OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF OUR U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FDIC AND THE OCC. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE,

THE FDIC OR OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON ANY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, COULD FURTHER AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL.

THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

TAX LEGISLATION INITIATIVES OR CHALLENGES TO OUR TAX

POSITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE OPERATE IN JURISDICTIONS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND OF VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES MAY BE PROPOSED, SUCH AS PROPOSALS

FOR FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TAX POSITIONS AND/OR OUR TAX LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, AS WELL AS FOREIGN, TAX LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO VARYING INTERPRETATIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR HISTORICAL TAX POSITIONS WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED BY RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES OR THAT WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OUR POSITION IN

CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH CHALLENGE.

BUSINESS RISKS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDES, IN ADDITION TO CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS AND ISSUERS, CASH, CREDIT

AND ACH, AS WELL AS EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

79

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AGGREGATORS (E.G., PAYPAL, SQUARE AND AMAZON), WIRELESS PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT

CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS. WE ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK ON A GLOBAL BASIS BASED ON PURCHASE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA, MASTERCARD AND CHINA UNIONPAY. WE BELIEVE VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST COUNTRIES.

AS A RESULT, COMPETITIVE CARD ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS ON THE VISA AND MASTERCARD NETWORKS MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE DOMINANT POSITION, RESOURCES, MARKETING AND PRICING OF VISA AND MASTERCARD.

BECAUSE OF CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS,

THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH US BEING ACQUIRED BY AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH A

COMPETITOR, RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL LOSS OF BUSINESS FOR US. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG

ALL ISSUERS REMAINS INTENSE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SOME OF

OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, INCLUDING LARGER CASH RESERVES, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING

AND MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION, CO-BRAND CARD PROGRAMS OR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS OR RESPOND OR ADAPT TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER

SPENDING HABITS AS EFFECTIVELY AS OUR COMPETITORS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ON DIFFERENT PLATFORMS THAN WE ARE. SPENDING ON OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS COULD CONTINUE TO BE

IMPACTED BY INCREASING CONSUMER USAGE OF DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETITIVE NETWORKS.

INTERNATIONALLY, COMPETITION REMAINS

FIERCE, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCELERATING OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES THROUGH PROPRIETARY CONSUMER, SMALL BUSINESS AND CORPORATE PRODUCTS, GNS PARTNERS AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY PROVIDED BY SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WITH SOCIAL

NETWORKING, ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS CONNECTION, TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS SUCH AS MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND AGGREGATORS ARE

WORKING TO DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE

PAYMENT VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH CONTINUE TO EMERGE AND GROW, AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND BOTH ON- AND OFF-LINE AND ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH

COULD FURTHER REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE.

TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS,

SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND IN THE ONLINE PAYMENTS SPACE, OUR DISCOUNT REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. THE COMPANYS ENTERPRISE GROWTH

GROUP FOCUSES ON THIS STRATEGIC CHALLENGE BY GENERATING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE ON A GLOBAL BASIS IN AREAS SUCH AS ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS AND FEE-BASED SERVICES. WHILE EXPANDING THE ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE

COMPANY, MANY OF THE GROWTH INITIATIVES WILL INVOLVE NEW AREAS FOR THE COMPANY AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY. OUR FAILURE TO EXPAND ENTERPRISE GROWTH AND DRIVE ADOPTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGY

AND PAYMENT OPTIONS THAT WE OFFER, WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE GROWTH. TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE MAY FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH RELEVANT

CUSTOMERS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. LAWS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT FAVOR LOCAL COMPETITORS, REQUIRE CARD TRANSACTIONS TO BE ROUTED OVER DOMESTIC NETWORKS OR PROHIBIT OR LIMIT

FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES COULD SLOW OUR GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL REGIONS. FURTHER, EXPANDING OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS, ADDING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION CHANNELS AND FORMING NEW PARTNERSHIPS COULD HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES THAN OUR CURRENT

ARRANGEMENTS, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE OR DILUTE OUR BRAND.

REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY PUT FORWARD VARIOUS

PROPOSALS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND PROPOSALS TO IMPOSE TAXES OR FEES ON

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE OR SIMILAR PROPOSALS, WHICH MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

80

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS THAT

ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON

HIGH REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MARKET PRESSURE, INCLUDING PRESSURE CREATED BY REGULATORY-MANDATED REDUCTIONS TO COMPETITORS PRICING, TO REDUCE MERCHANT

DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENTIATED PAYMENT MODELS FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE AND THE REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT COULD POSE CHALLENGES TO OUR

TRADITIONAL PAYMENT MODEL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE. A CONTINUING PRIORITY OF OURS IS TO DRIVE GREATER VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS, WHICH IF NOT SUCCESSFUL COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DISCOUNT REVENUE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IF WE

CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE OR ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES ON OUR CARDS AND HAVE OVERALL VOLUME GROWTH OR AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE AND ACTIVATION, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY,

AND THEREFORE OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN INNOVATION AND IN VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS, COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AN INCREASING PREVALENCE OF SURCHARGING BY MERCHANTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WHILE OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS GENERALLY DO NOT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING OUR CARDMEMBERS, MERCHANTS ARE

ENCOURAGED TO WELCOME OUR CARDMEMBERS AND ARE OBLIGED TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING ANY NON-DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS IN OUR AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN WHICH SURCHARGING IS SPECIFICALLY

PERMITTED, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS IN CERTAIN MERCHANT CATEGORIES AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS

GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, WHICH IS KNOWN AS DIFFERENTIAL SURCHARGING. NEW RULES ISSUED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA IN 2012 ALLOW US AND OTHER PAYMENT NETWORKS TO PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING BY

MORE THAN THEIR REASONABLE COSTS OF ACCEPTING A PARTICULAR PAYMENT CARD. THIS COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN HIGHER SURCHARGES ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS WHEN COMPARED TO CARDS ISSUED BY OTHER ISSUERS OR ON OTHER NETWORKS. IN ADDITION, THE PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT BY MASTERCARD AND VISA OF THEIR U.S. MERCHANT CLASS LITIGATION, WHICH WAS PRELIMINARILY APPROVED IN NOVEMBER 2012, REQUIRES MASTERCARD AND VISA TO PERMIT U.S. MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE MASTERCARD AND VISA CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS UNDER

CERTAIN TERMS AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WHILE PERMITTING THE NETWORKS TO CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT SURCHARGES ON DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS. MASTERCARD AND VISA HAVE ANNOUNCED REVISED NETWORK RULES THAT WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 27, 2013

THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS THAT ALSO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS FROM IMPLEMENTING SURCHARGES OF MASTERCARD AND/OR VISA CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS UNLESS THEY ALSO SURCHARGE AMERICAN EXPRESS TRANSACTIONS IN A MANNER THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE

NON-DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS GENERALLY AGREED TO BY MOST MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (I.E., BY SURCHARGING AMERICAN EXPRESS TRANSACTIONS BUT NOT SURCHARGING MASTERCARD AND VISA DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS). THIS MAY

ENCOURAGE MERCHANTS THAT CURRENTLY ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS TO EITHER VIOLATE THEIR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS OR TO DISCONTINUE ACCEPTANCE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. IF THIS OCCURS, IT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

AFFECT AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT COVERAGE AND CHARGE VOLUMES.

IF SURCHARGING BECOMES WIDESPREAD, AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND

CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS GENERALLY COULD BECOME LESS DESIRABLE TO CONSUMERS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN CARDS IN FORCE AND TRANSACTION VOLUMES. THE IMPACT COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE MANNER IN WHICH A SURCHARGE IS LEVIED AND WHETHER

SURCHARGES ARE LEVIED UPON ALL PAYMENT CARDS, WHETHER DEBIT CARDS ARE EXCLUDED, OR WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF THE SURCHARGE VARIES DEPENDING ON THE CARD, NETWORK, ACQUIRER OR ISSUER. SURCHARGING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY TO THE EXTENT SURCHARGING DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE CARD USAGE THROUGH OUR MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS, OR TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE

COSTS OF SUCH PROGRAMS, BOTH OF WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL

OF SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES,

DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER ATTRITION AND SEEK TO RETAIN OR CAPTURE A

GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING ON

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CARDS ISSUED ON OUR NETWORK, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

COST-EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES. FOR EXAMPLE, CARDMEMBERS INCREASED ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM DROVE AN INCREASE IN THE ULTIMATE REDEMPTION RATE TO 94 PERCENT IN 2012 FROM 92 PERCENT IN 2011, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER REWARDS EXPENSES IN 2012. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE INSTITUTED REWARDS AND CO-BRAND PROGRAMS THAT ARE

SIMILAR TO OURS, AND ISSUERS MAY IN THE FUTURE INSTITUTE PROGRAMS THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO CARDMEMBERS THAN OUR PROGRAMS.

IF WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS, WE WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO OFFSET THE

FINANCIAL IMPACT BY INCREASING PAYMENTS VOLUME, THE AMOUNT OF FEE-BASED SERVICES WE PROVIDE OR BOTH. WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DOING SO, PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY, AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, AND WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRESERVE, GROW

AND LEVERAGE THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE, TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUSINESS PRACTICES,

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE QUALITIES. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS  EVEN IF RELATED TO SEEMINGLY ISOLATED INCIDENTS  COULD ERODE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG EXISTING AND

POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES. NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION COULD ALSO RESULT FROM ACTUAL OR ALLEGED CONDUCT IN ANY NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES OR

CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING CARD PRACTICES, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND THE USE AND PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION, AND FROM ACTIONS TAKEN BY REGULATORS OR OTHERS IN RESPONSE TO SUCH CONDUCT. SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS CAN ALSO CAUSE RAPID, WIDESPREAD

REPUTATIONAL HARM TO OUR BRAND.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION MAY ALSO BE HARMED BY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE

OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, ANY SHORTCOMING OF A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR OR GNS PARTNER THAT ISSUES CARDS AND ACQUIRES MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK MAY BE ATTRIBUTED BY CARDMEMBERS AND MERCHANTS TO US, THUS DAMAGING OUR REPUTATION AND

BRAND VALUE. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR LITIGATION AGAINST US. FURTHERMORE, AS A CORPORATION WITH

HEADQUARTERS AND OPERATIONS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF THE UNITED STATES ARISING FROM ITS POLITICAL OR OTHER POSITIONS COULD HARM THE PERCEPTION OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BRAND. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF

POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY, OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IMPORTANT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE STRATEGIC

INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND DRIVE LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE, AND INCLUDE.



INCREASING PLASTIC PENETRATION, INCLUDING BY GROWING OUR SHARE OF PREMIUM AND SMALL BUSINESS SPEND AND B2B PAYMENTS



CONTINUING TO EXPAND INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH PROPRIETARY AND GNS OFFERINGS



EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIGITAL PAYMENTS SPACE, INCLUDING ONLINE AND MOBILE CHANNELS



SUCCESSFULLY LEVERAGING OUR BRAND IN THE PREPAID SPACE



GROWING OUR EXISTING FEE-BASED BUSINESSES SUCH AS INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER SERVICES AND INTRODUCING NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES TO INCREASE FEE

REVENUE

THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ENHANCING EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS

COMPLEX, COSTLY AND UNCERTAIN, AND ANY FAILURE BY US TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS ACCURATELY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR MARKET SHARE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

82

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO CONTINUE TO PURSUE A DISCIPLINED EXPENSE-MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, INCLUDING

RESTRUCTURING OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF EXPENSES IN THE FUTURE, PARTICULARLY AS EXPENSES INCURRED IN OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE VOLATILITY AND REGULATORY

COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL AND RELATED COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT OR CONTROL, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CURRENT REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT. MOREOVER, WE HAVE INCURRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR, COSTS OF INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESSES. THESE

INVESTMENTS MAY NOT BE AS PRODUCTIVE AS WE EXPECT OR AT ALL.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN REALIZING THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR

INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY.

WE HAVE RECENTLY ACQUIRED A

NUMBER OF BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR ACQUISITIONS OF SERVE, ACCERTIFY AND LOYALTY PARTNER, AND MADE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. WE MAY ALSO EVALUATE OTHER POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY SUITABLE CANDIDATES, VALUE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OR ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ACCURATELY AND NEGOTIATE ACCEPTABLE TERMS FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES, AND

COMPLETE PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, BUSINESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION OR

INVESTMENT, INCUR UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AND HARM OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY.

A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF OUR

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES PROCESS, TRANSMIT AND STORE CARDMEMBER ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION

WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS, AND IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE COLLECT, ANALYZE AND RETAIN SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES OF CERTAIN TYPES OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE AND OTHER INFORMATION PERTAINING TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES. INFORMATION

SECURITY RISKS FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US HAVE GENERALLY INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. CRIMINALS ARE USING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT, AND TO EXPOSE AND EXPLOIT POTENTIAL SECURITY AND PRIVACY VULNERABILITIES IN CORPORATE SYSTEMS AND WEB SITES. AS OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION OF

FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY INCREASE, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS AND THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTS

THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AND OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, MAY BE COMPROMISED.

WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO DETECT

AND PREVENT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE COSTLY AND REQUIRE ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CHANGE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY

MEASURES BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF DATA BREACHES, MALICIOUS SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND FRAUDULENT OR OTHER MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN.

OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS, MAY EXPERIENCE

SERVICE DISRUPTIONS OR DEGRADATION BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY MALFUNCTION, SUDDEN INCREASES IN CUSTOMER TRANSACTION VOLUME, NATURAL DISASTERS, ACCIDENTS, POWER OUTAGES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, FRAUD, DENIAL-OF-SERVICE AND OTHER CYBER ATTACKS,

TERRORISM, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, OR SIMILAR EVENTS. SERVICE DISRUPTIONS COULD PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR ONLINE SERVICES AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION, COMPROMISE COMPANY OR CUSTOMER DATA, AND IMPEDE TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND

FINANCIAL REPORTING. INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE IN LESSER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES COULD ALSO RESULT IN SERVICE DISRUPTIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN THOSE COUNTRIES.

IF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH OR IF ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED FRAUD LEVELS OR OTHER

ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE DUE TO THE ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, EMPLOYEE ERROR, MALFEASANCE OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE), INCREASED LITIGATION AND REMEDIATION

COSTS, GREATER CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS AND/OR BUSINESS PARTNERS RELATING TO THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF THEIR DATA, AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. DATA BREACHES AND OTHER ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED FAILURES TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY, TRS AND ITS U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES BY BANKING

REGULATORS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY,

THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND ALLIANCES OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE

PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COSTCO AND DELTA AIR LINES TO OFFER CO-BRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED

WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. UNDER SOME TYPES OF THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE OR ACCELERATE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN BUSINESS PARTNERS

SUCH AS CO-BRAND PARTNERS AND MERCHANTS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS SUCH AS: (I) OUR FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY, (II) OUR ECONOMIC CONDITION DETERIORATING SUCH THAT OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING IS DOWNGRADED

SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE BY S&P AND MOODYS, (III) OUR CEASING TO HAVE A PUBLIC DEBT RATING, OR (IV) A SHORTFALL IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE LEVELS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD

UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, WE HAVE CREDIT RISK TO CERTAIN CO-BRAND PARTNERS RELATING TO OUR PREPAYMENTS FOR LOYALTY

PROGRAM POINTS THAT MAY NOT BE FULLY REDEEMED. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS, INSOLVENCIES, FINANCIAL DISTRESS, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT PARTICULAR CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE

WERE OBLIGATED TO OR ELECTED TO REIMBURSE CARDMEMBERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PURCHASED FROM MERCHANTS THAT HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS OR STOPPED ACCEPTING OUR CARDS.

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS AND IN RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012.

THERE

CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES (E.G., AMERICAN/US AIRWAY AND UNITED AIRLINES/CONTINENTAL AIRLINES), THROUGH MERGERS AND/OR GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES AND

JOINT VENTURES, AND THIS TREND COULD CONTINUE.

IN PARTICULAR, THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS GRANTED

ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO MEMBERS OF THE SKYTEAM, STAR AND ONEWORLD ALLIANCES, ENABLING THE COVERED AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR CROSS-REGIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS,

INCLUDING JOINTLY PRICING AND MANAGING CAPACITY ON COVERED ROUTES, SHARING REVENUES AND COSTS, AND COORDINATING SALES AND CORPORATE CONTRACTS, ALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. THE EC HAS SIMILARLY APPROVED THE ONEWORLD ALLIANCE, AND

ITS REVIEW OF THE OTHER ALLIANCES AND COOPERATION BETWEEN ALLIANCE MEMBERS IS CONTINUING.

INCREASING CONSOLIDATION AND

EXPANDED ANTITRUST IMMUNITY COULD CREATE CHALLENGES FOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AIRLINES INCLUDING REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY ON OUR AIRLINE BUSINESS. FURTHER CONSOLIDATION MAY ALSO RESULT FROM AIRLINE BANKRUPTCIES, WHICH COULD BE AN OUTCOME OF

AMERICAN AIRLINES PENDING CASE UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE.

AIRLINES ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

AND VALUABLE PARTNERS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. IF A PARTICIPATING AIRLINE MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION.

SIMILARLY, IF ONE OF OUR CO-BRAND AIRLINE PARTNERS MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT HAD A COMPETING CO-BRAND CARD, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH CO-BRAND CARDS IT WOULD OFFER. OUR LARGEST AIRLINE CO-BRAND LOAN PORTFOLIO, AMERICAN

EXPRESS DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARD, ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN 15 PERCENT OF WORLDWIDE CARDMEMBER LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012.

IF AN AIRLINE DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW FROM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS OR TO CEASE OFFERING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CO-BRAND CARD, WHETHER AS THE RESULT OF A MERGER OR OTHERWISE, SUCH AS THE WITHDRAWAL OF CONTINENTAL

AIRLINES IN 2011 FROM OUR AIRPORT CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARDMEMBERS AND OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TRANSFER PROGRAM, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE GENERAL RISKS

RELATED TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT  EXPOSURE TO AIRLINE INDUSTRY ON PAGE 38 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE SUCCESSFUL, AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE

ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED.

MANY FACTORS CAN INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT OF OUR EXPENSES, AS

WELL AS HOW QUICKLY THEY MAY INCREASE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS, MAY INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR

BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS (INCLUDING THE REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE), ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR

OPERATING EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING,

AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER-COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET AND MOBILE CHANNELS TO SAVE COSTS AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE

REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, OR IF THE ACTIONS TAKEN ULTIMATELY COME AT THE EXPENSE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL

OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS OR SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR EXPENSES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR PREVIOUSLY

ANNOUNCED FINANCIAL TARGETS.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND RETURN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE TYPES OF RISK TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, COMPLIANCE RISK AND REPUTATIONAL RISK. SEE RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 37- 40 OF OUR 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO

DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES, MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. IN ADDITION, AS

REGULATIONS AND MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE CHANGES. IF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY OR MITIGATE OUR RISKS, WE COULD

SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANAGEMENT OF OUR RISKS IN SOME CASES DEPENDS UPON THE

USE OF ANALYTICAL AND/OR FORECASTING MODELS. IF THE MODELS WE USE TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE INADEQUATE, WE MAY INCUR INCREASED LOSSES. IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE RISKS THAT EXIST, OR THAT DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, THAT WE HAVE NOT APPROPRIATELY

ANTICIPATED, IDENTIFIED OR MITIGATED.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS AND

SETTLEMENT RISK WITH REGARD TO GNS PARTNERS, MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES, THE RATE OF BANKRUPTCIES, AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS THAT CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD

PRODUCTS.

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CONSUMER CREDIT RISK,

PRINCIPALLY FROM CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND OUR OTHER CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM MERCHANTS, GNS PARTNERS AND GCP CLIENTS. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK. OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS CREDITWORTHINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THE CRITERIA OR MODELS WE USE TO MANAGE OUR CREDIT RISK BECOME LESS PREDICTIVE OF

FUTURE LOSSES, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR LOSSES TO RISE AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR

LOAN LOSSES. ALTHOUGH DELINQUENCIES AND CHARGE-OFFS DECLINED IN 2012, WE BELIEVE WE ARE EXPERIENCING HISTORICAL LOWS IN THESE RATES AND THEY ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE. IN ADDITION, IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DO NOT IMPROVE, THESE RATES MAY INCREASE MORE

THAN EXPECTED. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS THAT

WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF MAY BE LIMITED, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES

TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION WE USE IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW

OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

85

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. INCREASED CREDIT RISK, WHETHER RESULTING FROM

UNDERESTIMATING THE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR OTHERWISE, COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. MARKET RISK

REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD BUSINESS AND IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES

AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST YIELD, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET

INCOME, COULD FALL.

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS AND OUR LIABILITIES AND, IN

PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE, INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. LIQUIDITY RISK IS DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO ACCESS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK, WE MAY MAINTAIN TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY, WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND LIMIT FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY; OR WE MAY BE TOO

ILLIQUID, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING A LIQUIDITY EVENT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK, SEE 

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL

 ABOVE.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL AND

COMPLIANCE RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT ACHIEVING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, POOR DATA QUALITY, HUMAN ERROR OR THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

(I.E., NATURAL DISASTERS). OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDES, AMONG OTHERS, THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE ERROR OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL FINANCIAL MISSTATEMENT; A FAILURE TO MONITOR AN OUTSOURCE PARTNERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE

LEVEL AGREEMENT OR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS; OR A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR AND CONTROL ACCESS TO DATA IN OUR SYSTEMS WE GRANT TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. AS PROCESSES ARE CHANGED, OR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE INTRODUCED, WE

MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR IDENTIFY NEW OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES. COMPLIANCE RISK ARISES FROM THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS AND INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE

RISKS CAN EXPOSE US TO REPUTATIONAL RISKS AS WELL AS FINES, CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES OR PAYMENT OF DAMAGES AND CAN LEAD TO DIMINISHED BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND DIMINISHED ABILITY TO EXPAND KEY OPERATIONS.

AN INABILITY TO ACCEPT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND OR REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION

AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING, OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM

INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL SAVINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $39.7 BILLION IN TOTAL U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS. MANY OTHER FINANCIAL

SERVICES FIRMS ARE INCREASING THEIR USE OF DEPOSIT FUNDING, AND AS SUCH WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE DEPOSIT MARKETS, PARTICULARLY AS TO BROKERAGE NETWORKS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW THIS INCREASED COMPETITION WILL AFFECT DEPOSIT

RENEWAL RATES, COSTS OR AVAILABILITY. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO OFFER HIGHER INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS, OUR FUNDING COSTS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS ALSO IS DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS

(1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAS BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS, AND SUCH

DEPOSITS ARE CONSIDERED BROKERED DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES, ALTHOUGH A MAJORITY OF THE DEPOSITS RAISED DURING 2012 WERE ACCEPTED DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL SAVINGS. A BANK THAT IS LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED

GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA.

AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION BY THE FDIC. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT

SOLICIT DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN THE

86

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE

PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN

AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN

RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND REQUIRE AN UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS.

WHILE CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB WERE CONSIDERED WELL CAPITALIZED FOR THESE PURPOSES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THIS DEFINITION.

BASEL III, WHEN IMPLEMENTED BY THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES AND FULLY PHASED IN, WILL REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL, WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, OUR

REGULATORS CAN ADJUST THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED AT ANY TIME AND HAVE AUTHORITY TO PLACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR DEPOSIT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE INTEREST RATE WE PAY ON DEPOSITS. AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS IN THE FUTURE

COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF

VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, PLATFORMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE OPERATE A SERVICE NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD-PARTY VENDORS MANY OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL

TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THIS OUTSOURCING OCCURS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ALSO RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO INTERACT WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES. WE

ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS

COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT OR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN ECONOMIC AND REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES OR COMMUNICATED OVER

THIRD-PARTY NETWORKS OR PLATFORMS COULD BECOME COMPROMISED. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DECREASES OUR CONTROL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF CERTAIN

OUTSOURCINGS WILL DECREASE AS THE DEMAND FOR THESE SERVICES INCREASES AROUND THE WORLD.

ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY

SERVICE PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, PROCESSORS, AGGREGATORS, GNS PARTNERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF ACCURATE INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER FAILS TO PROVIDE THE DATA QUALITY, COMMUNICATIONS

CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS, TERRORISM, HACKING OR OTHER CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES. SEE 

A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR

BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND

ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS

 ABOVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, WEATHER,

NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS.

GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER

CONDITIONS, HEALTH PANDEMICS, INTRUSION INTO OR DEGRADATION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BY HACKERS AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED

AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS.

BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS IS LIKELY TO DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT

INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS. IN ADDITION, DISRUPTIONS IN AIR TRAVEL AND OTHER FORMS OF TRAVEL CAUSED BY SUCH EVENTS CAN RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS UNDER TRAVEL INTERRUPTION INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WE OFFER AND, IF SUCH DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL

ARE PROLONGED, THEY CAN MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OVERALL TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING. IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) RESULT IN WIDESPREAD OR LENGTHY DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL, THEY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. CARDMEMBER SPENDING MAY ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN AREAS AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. THE IMPACT OF SUCH EVENTS ON THE OVERALL ECONOMY MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

CORPORATE MATTERS

DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AS REGULATORY INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD NETWORK PRICING TO MERCHANTS AND RELATED ISSUES HAS INCREASED, THE

COMPANY HAS RESPONDED TO MANY INQUIRIES FROM BANKING AND COMPETITION AUTHORITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

2010, THE DOJ, ALONG WITH ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM CONNECTICUT, IOWA, MARYLAND, MICHIGAN, MISSOURI, OHIO AND TEXAS, FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AGAINST THE COMPANY, MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL

INCORPORATED AND VISA, INC., ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS POLICIES PROHIBITING MERCHANTS FROM STEERING A CUSTOMER TO USE ANOTHER NETWORKS CARD, ANOTHER

TYPE OF CARD OR ANOTHER METHOD OF PAYMENT (ANTI-STEERING AND NON-DISCRIMINATION RULES AND CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS) VIOLATE THE ANTITRUST LAWS. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS PARTICIPATE IN TWO DISTINCT MARKETS, A

GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK SERVICES MARKET AND A GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK SERVICES MARKET FOR MERCHANTS IN TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT (T&E) BUSINESSES. THE COMPLAINT CONTENDS THAT EACH OF THE DEFENDANTS

HAS MARKET POWER IN THE ALLEGED TWO MARKETS. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS A JUDGMENT PERMANENTLY ENJOINING THE DEFENDANTS FROM ENFORCING THEIR ANTI-STEERING AND NON-DISCRIMINATION RULES AND CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS. THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT SEEK MONETARY

DAMAGES. CONCURRENT WITH THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT, VISA AND MASTERCARD ANNOUNCED THEY HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT SETTLING THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPLAINT AGAINST THEM BY AGREEING TO MODIFICATIONS IN THEIR RULES PROHIBITING MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT

THEIR CARDS FROM STEERING CUSTOMERS TO USE ANOTHER NETWORKS CARD, ANOTHER TYPE OF CARD OR ANOTHER METHOD OF PAYMENT. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE COMPLAINT FILED BY THE DOJ AND CERTAIN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL WAS AMENDED TO ADD AS PLAINTIFFS THE

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AGAINST AMERICAN EXPRESS BROUGHT BY MERCHANTS ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANYS ANTI-STEERING PROVISIONS IN ITS MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH THE PLAINTIFFS VIOLATE FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAWS. AS ALLEGED BY THE

PLAINTIFFS, THESE PROVISIONS PREVENT MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING CONSUMERS INCENTIVES TO USE ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF PAYMENT WHEN CONSUMERS WISH TO USE AN AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARD. PLAINTIFFS SEEK DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTIONS HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY STAYED IN LIGHT OF THE CONTINUING APPEAL IN
