INCLUDING CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES, MID-MARKET COMPANIES, LARGE CORPORATIONS, AND

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BANKING INSTITUTIONS. THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD THROUGH VARIOUS CHANNELS INCLUDING

DIRECT MAIL, ONLINE, TARGETED SALES FORCES AND DIRECT RESPONSE ADVERTISING.

OUR

GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, CARD ISSUING AND MERCHANT ACQUIRING AND PROCESSING

BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL IN SCOPE. WE ARE A WORLD LEADER IN PROVIDING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO

CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. THESE CARDS, WHICH INCLUDE CARDS ISSUED BY AMERICAN

EXPRESS AS WELL AS CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED ON

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (COLLECTIVELY, CARDS), ARE CURRENTLY ISSUED IN OVER 40 CURRENCIES.

OUR CARDS PERMIT CARDMEMBERS TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND

THE WORLD AT THE MILLIONS OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO. WE ADDED A NET TOTAL OF

7.0 MILLION CARDS IN 2006, BRINGING TOTAL WORLDWIDE CARDS-IN-FORCE TO 78.0 MILLION (INCLUDING CARDS

ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES). IN 2006, OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS (SPENDING ON AMERICAN

EXPRESS

®

CARDS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS $561.5 BILLION.

SPEND-CENTRIC MODEL IS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS MODEL (WHICH FOCUSES ON GENERATING REVENUES

PRIMARILY BY DRIVING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND SECONDARILY BY FINANCE CHARGES AND FEES) HAS

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. AVERAGE SPENDING PER CARDMEMBER, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER

THAN FOR OUR COMPETITORS, REPRESENTS GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN THE FORM OF LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND

HIGHER SALES. THIS GIVES US THE ABILITY TO EARN A PREMIUM DISCOUNT RATE AND INVEST IN GREATER

VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS. AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER REVENUES GENERATED

FROM HIGHER SPENDING, WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES

TO CARDMEMBERS, WHICH IN TURN CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO SPEND MORE ON THEIR CARDS. THIS

BUSINESS MODEL, ALONG WITH OUR CLOSED LOOP NETWORK, IN WHICH WE ARE BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND THE

MERCHANT ACQUIRER, GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WE SEEK TO LEVERAGE TO PROVIDE MORE VALUE

TO CARDMEMBERS, MERCHANTS AND CARD ISSUING PARTNERS.

OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, ALTHOUGH TRAVEL

SALES TEND TO BE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER; TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES

OUTSTANDING TEND TO BE GREATEST EACH YEAR IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD QUARTER, AND

CARD BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES  TRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY, QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE  ARE

KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR BRAND BY EDUCATING EMPLOYEES ABOUT THESE

ATTRIBUTES AND BY INCORPORATING THEM INTO OUR PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR BRAND HAS BEEN

RATED ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE BRANDS IN THE WORLD IN VARIOUS SURVEYS, AND WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES

US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE BELIEVE OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE CRITICAL

TO OUR SUCCESS, AND WE INVEST HEAVILY IN MANAGING, MARKETING AND PROMOTING IT. (WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR

EXPENSES IN MANAGING OUR BRAND ADVERTISING AND RELATED CAMPAIGNS IN THE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT

SERVICES SEGMENT DISCUSSED BELOW.) IN ADDITION, WE PLACE SIGNIFICANT

IMPORTANCE ON TRADEMARKS, SERVICEMARKS AND PATENTS, AND DILIGENTLY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

WE OPERATE A GLOBAL GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK THROUGH OUR GLOBAL NETWORK

SERVICES (GNS) BUSINESS. NETWORK FUNCTIONS INCLUDE OPERATIONS, SERVICE DELIVERY, SYSTEMS,

AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING, SETTLEMENT AND BRAND ADVERTISING AND MARKETING; THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS FOR THE NETWORK; AND ESTABLISHING AND ENHANCING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS

GLOBALLY.

SINCE MAY 1996, WE HAVE BEEN PURSUING A STRATEGY OF INVITING U.S. BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS

TO ISSUE CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, BUILDING ON A BUSINESS STRATEGY WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED

SUCCESSFULLY IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHERE WE HAVE MANY BANKS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ISSUING CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL

INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WE AIM TO BROADEN OUR CARDMEMBER AND

MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. OUR GNS BUSINESS HAS ESTABLISHED MORE THAN 105 CARD

ISSUING OR MERCHANT ACQUIRING ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN 120 COUNTRIES.

A KEY ASSET OF OUR NETWORK IS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORLDS MOST

HIGHLY RECOGNIZED AND RESPECTED BRANDS.

CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE ISSUED BY OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS

TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. (TRS), AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND ALSO BY

THIRD-PARTY INSTITUTIONS, AND ARE ACCEPTED AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE GENERALLY

ACCEPTED AT ATM LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT CARDS. TRS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE THE VAST

MAJORITY OF CARDS ON OUR NETWORK.

GNS FOCUSES ON PARTNERING WITH QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

THAT CHOOSE TO ISSUE CARDS ACCEPTED ON OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. ALTHOUGH WE CUSTOMIZE OUR NETWORK

ARRANGEMENTS TO THE PARTICULAR MARKET AND OUR PARTNERS REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO OUR STRATEGIC

PLANS IN THAT MARKETPLACE, ALL GNS ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ISSUERS DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR

THEIR HIGHEST-SPENDING AND MOST AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND TO SUPPORT THE VALUE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS

CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MERCHANTS. WE CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH INSTITUTIONS WHO SHARE A CORE SET OF

ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS, STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE AND

COMPATIBILITY WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, AND WE REQUIRE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRODUCT, BRAND AND

SERVICE STANDARDS.

*

OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS FALL INTO THREE MAIN CATEGORIES.

*

THE USE OF THE TERM

PARTNER OR PARTNERING DOES NOT MEAN OR IMPLY A

FORMAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP.

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIRST TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS AN INDEPENDENT OPERATOR (IO) ARRANGEMENT. AS

OF THE END OF 2006, WE HAD 55 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS

TO EXPAND THE PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE

DO NOT OFFER A PROPRIETARY LOCAL CURRENCY CARD. UNDER THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT, THE PARTNERS

LOCAL PRESENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS HELP US ENHANCE THE IMPACT OF OUR BRAND IN THE MARKET, REACH

MERCHANT COVERAGE GOALS MORE QUICKLY, AND OPERATE AT ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE

DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. WE LICENSE OUR BANK PARTNER TO ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS

IN THEIR MARKET, INCLUDING THE CLASSIC GREEN, GOLD AND PLATINUM AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. IN

ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF THESE PARTNERS SERVE AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR FOR LOCAL

MERCHANTS. AMERICAN EXPRESS RETAINS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MULTI-NATIONAL MERCHANTS. OUR IO

PARTNER OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIT RISK FOR THE CARDS IT ISSUES, AND MAKES THE

DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL BE ISSUED CARDS. GNS GENERATES REVENUES IN IO ARRANGEMENTS

FROM FEES PAID BY THE IO PARTNER DERIVED FROM THE NUMBER OF CARDS IT ISSUES, THE LEVEL OF

CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON THOSE CARDS, ROYALTIES AND THE TOTAL CHARGE VOLUME AT MERCHANTS WITH WHICH

THE IO PARTNER HAS AN AGREEMENT TO ACCEPT CARDS. OUR IO PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSACTION

AUTHORIZATION, BILLING AND PRICING, CARDMEMBER SERVICING AND FUNDING CARD RECEIVABLES FOR ITS

CARDS.

EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE ENTERED INTO IO ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE ECUADOR, GREECE,

SOUTH KOREA, PAKISTAN, CROATIA, PERU, PORTUGAL AND VIETNAM. IN 2006, WE SOLD OUR PROPRIETARY CARD

ISSUING AND RELATED BUSINESSES IN BRAZIL, MALAYSIA AND INDONESIA TO GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES IO

PARTNERS BANCO BRADESCO S.A., MAYBANK AND BANK DANAMON, RESPECTIVELY. THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIPS

WITH THESE LEADING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WE BELIEVE WE CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH IN CARDMEMBER

SPENDING, CARDS-IN-FORCE AND MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE IN THESE COUNTRIES.

THE SECOND TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS A NETWORK CARD LICENSE (NCL) (WHICH WE

FORMERLY REFERRED TO AS A NON-PROPRIETARY LICENSE). AT THE END OF 2006, WE HAD 48 OF THESE

ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO INCREASE OUR BRAND PRESENCE AND GAIN MARKET

SHARE IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE A PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS, AND IN A FEW CASES THOSE IN

WHICH WE ALSO HAVE IO PARTNERS. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, WE GRANT THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION A LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. THE NCL ISSUER OWNS THE CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS FOR ALL CARDS IT ISSUES, PROVIDES CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ITS CARDMEMBERS, TRANSACTION

AUTHORIZATION, BILLING AND CREDIT MANAGEMENT, AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MARKETING OF THE CARDS, AND DESIGNS THE CARD PRODUCT FEATURES

(INCLUDING REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR CARD HOLDERS), SUBJECT TO

MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS. WE OPERATE THE MERCHANT NETWORK, ROUTE

AND PROCESS CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANTS POINT-OF-SALE THROUGH SUBMISSION TO THE ISSUER,

AND SETTLE WITH ISSUERS. THE NCL IS THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED

WITH BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES.

EXAMPLES OF NCL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N.A. AND

BANK OF AMERICA IN THE UNITED STATES, LLOYDS TSB BANK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND WESTPAC BANKING

CORPORATION IN AUSTRALIA.

GNS REVENUES IN NCL ARRANGEMENTS ARE RELATED TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF

CARDMEMBER SPENDING, ROYALTIES AND FEES CHARGED TO THE CARD ISSUER BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, AND OUR

PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SUCH AS CARDMEMBER INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER CARD FEATURES AND BENEFITS FOR THE ISSUERS CARDS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THE NCL ISSUER

BEARS THE CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL AS THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION COSTS,

CARDMEMBER FRAUD RISKS AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND OTHER LOYALTY INITIATIVES. WE BEAR THE RISK

ARISING FROM THE GNS PARTNERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE

MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH ISSUERS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET

THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF

THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN

ADDITION, WE GENERALLY REQUIRE NCL ISSUERS TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER

COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

THE THIRD TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS A JOINT VENTURE. WE HAVE UTILIZED THIS TYPE OF

ARRANGEMENT IN SWITZERLAND, BELGIUM AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES. IN THESE MARKETS, TRS JOINS WITH

A THIRD PARTY TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN WHICH TRS HAS A SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP STAKE. THE

JOINT VENTURE TYPICALLY SIGNS NEW MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND ISSUES LOCAL

CURRENCY CARDS THAT CARRY OUR LOGO. IN A JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENT, THE JOINT VENTURE ASSUMES THE

CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK AND BEARS THE OPERATING AND MARKETING COSTS. THE ECONOMICS OF THE JOINT

VENTURE ARE SIMILAR TO OUR PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS, WHICH WE DISCUSS BELOW UNDER U.S.

CARD SERVICES, AND WE RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE JOINT VENTURES INCOME DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF

OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST.

GROSS REVENUES WE RECEIVE PER DOLLAR SPENT ON A CARD ISSUED BY A GNS PARTNER ARE LOWER THAN

THOSE FROM OUR PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GNS PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR MOST OF THE OPERATING COSTS AND RISK OF ITS CARD ISSUING BUSINESS, OUR EXPENSES ARE LOWER THAN

THOSE IN OUR PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS. THE GNS BUSINESS MODEL GENERATES AN ATTRACTIVE

EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE THAT REQUIRES A LOWER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SUPPORT. THE RETURN ON

EQUITY IN OUR GNS BUSINESS CAN THUS BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD

ISSUING BUSINESS. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF GNS COSTS ARE FIXED, THE GNS BUSINESS IS HIGHLY

SCALABLE. GNS PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND THEIR

ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND AND DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS

WITH INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.

IN 2006, GNS SIGNED 11 NEW PARTNERS TO ISSUE CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GNS

PARTNERS LAUNCHED OVER 125 NEW PRODUCTS DURING 2006, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS PARTNER PRODUCTS TO APPROXIMATELY 550. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE

SIGNED A NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR IN MARKETS SUCH AS BRAZIL, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA AND

TURKEY.

SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR GNS BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN 2006 INCLUDE.



LAUNCH OF THE VIRGIN ATLANTIC AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CARD IN CONJUNCTION

WITH VIRGIN ATLANTIC AND MBNA EUROPE BANK;



LAUNCH OF THE DUAL CURRENCY ICBC CORPORATE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD AND THE

ICBC CHINA PETROL AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD WITH INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA

AND PETROCHINA COMPANY LIMITED;



LAUNCH OF THE SAA VOYAGER CREDIT CARD IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NEDBANK AND SOUTH

AFRICAN AIRWAYS; AND



LAUNCH OF THE KOREAN AIR AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD, THE FIRST AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED AIRLINE COBRAND CARD IN KOREA, IN CONJUNCTION WITH SAMSUNG CARD AND

KOREAN AIR.

IN CONTRAST TO THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHERE BANKS AND OTHER QUALIFIED

INSTITUTIONS HAVE ISSUED CARDS ON OUR NETWORK FOR MANY YEARS, UNTIL 2004 NO MAJOR U.S. BANKS HAD

ISSUED CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL NETWORK. THIS SITUATION WAS THE

RESULT OF RULES AND POLICIES OF VISA U.S.A. AND VISA INTERNATIONAL SERVICE ASSOCIATION (TOGETHER,

VISA) AND MASTERCARD, INCORPORATED AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC. (TOGETHER, MASTERCARD) IN

THE UNITED STATES, WHICH MANDATED EXPULSION OF MEMBERS THAT ISSUED AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS.

NO BANK WAS WILLING TO RISK FORFEITING MEMBERSHIP IN VISA AND/OR MASTERCARD (COLLECTIVELY, THE

BANKCARD ASSOCIATIONS) TO ISSUE CARDS ON OUR NETWORK.

HOWEVER, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DECISION IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN OCTOBER 1998 BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD IN WHICH SUCH RULES AND POLICIES WERE FOUND TO

VIOLATE THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS, THESE RULES AND POLICIES WERE FINALLY REPEALED IN LATE 2004 AFTER

THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO HEAR VISAS AND MASTERCARDS APPEAL OF THE LOWER COURTS RULINGS

AGAINST THEM. THE SUPREME COURTS DECISION NOT TO HEAR THE APPEALS MARKED THE END OF VISAS AND

MASTERCARDS RULES THAT PREVENTED THEIR MEMBER BANKS FROM ISSUING CARDS ON COMPETITIVE NETWORKS AND

CLEARED THE WAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRIAL COURTS ORDER REQUIRING THE REPEAL OF THE ILLEGAL

RULES. WE VIEW THIS DECISION AS A MAJOR VICTORY FOR U.S. CONSUMERS AS WELL AS U.S. BANKS BECAUSE

IT OPENED THE DOOR TO MORE VIGOROUS NETWORK COMPETITION AND MORE INNOVATIVE CARD PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE CONCLUSION OF THE LITIGATION BROUGHT BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MEANT

THAT WE WERE NOW ABLE TO OPEN OUR NETWORK TO OTHER CARD ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES, JUST AS WE

HAVE DONE INTERNATIONALLY. BUILDING A NETWORK BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT OPERATES IN

ADDITION TO OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS PROVIDES US WITH NEW AND SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

GROWTH. WE HAVE ACTED ON THIS DECISION BY ENTERING INTO SEVERAL GNS ARRANGEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAVE ALL LAUNCHED PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE. THESE

COMPANIES INCLUDE MBNA, BANK OF AMERICA, CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N.A., HSBC BANK NEVADA N.A.,

BARCLAYS, WHICH ISSUES CARDS TO U.S. WEALTH MANAGEMENT CLIENTS OF UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC., AND

USAA FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A GNS ARRANGEMENT WITH GE MONEY UNDER WHICH GE MONEY BANK ISSUES CARDS

ACCEPTED ON OUR NETWORK, THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THE DILLARDS AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, WE FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST VISA, MASTERCARD AND CERTAIN OF THEIR MEMBER

BANKS SEEKING MONETARY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE ILLEGAL RULES THAT WERE STRUCK DOWN IN THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LAWSUIT DISCUSSED ABOVE. (YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT THIS LAWSUIT IN THE LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS SECTION OF THIS REPORT BELOW.)

WITH APPROXIMATELY 550 DIFFERENT CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED ON OUR NETWORK SO FAR BY OUR BANK

PARTNERS, GNS IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT IS STRENGTHENING OUR BRAND VISIBILITY

AROUND THE WORLD, DRIVING MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO OUR MERCHANT NETWORK AND INCREASING THE

NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. GNS ENABLES US TO EXPAND OUR GLOBAL

PRESENCE WITHOUT HAVING TO INVEST LARGE AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES, AS OUR GNS

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PARTNERS ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED ATTRACTIVE CUSTOMER BASES THEY CAN TARGET WITH AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED PRODUCTS. SINCE 1999, CARDS-IN-FORCE ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS HAVE GROWN AT A

COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 27%, AND TOTALED 15 MILLION CARDS AT THE END OF 2006. OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 50% OF NEW CARDS ISSUED IN 2006 WERE CARDS ISSUED BY ONE OF OUR GNS

PARTNERS. SPENDING ON THESE CARDS HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE

OF 25% SINCE 1999, AND

TOTALED $35.4 BILLION IN 2006.

WITH THE INCREASE IN ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION DATA OVER MERCHANTS

POINT-OF-SALE SYSTEMS, THE NECESSITY FOR MERCHANTS AND MERCHANT PROCESSORS TO SECURE THIS DATA

AGAINST ACCIDENTAL OR INTENTIONAL COMPROMISE USING A STANDARD PROTOCOL THAT APPLIES TO ALL CARD

TYPES BECAME CLEAR TO AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THE OTHER MAJOR CARD NETWORKS. IN 2006, IN ORDER TO

STRENGTHEN THE SECURITY PRACTICES OF MERCHANTS AND PAYMENT PROCESSING FIRMS AND TO SECURE PAYMENT

ACCOUNT DATA IN A GLOBALLY CONSISTENT MANNER, WE AND DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, JCB, MASTERCARD

WORLDWIDE AND VISA INTERNATIONAL FORMED PCI SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL, LLC (PCI CO.), AN

INDEPENDENT STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE THE ONGOING EVOLUTION OF THE PAYMENT CARD

INDUSTRY (PCI) DATA SECURITY STANDARD, WHICH FOCUSES ON IMPROVING PAYMENT CARD ACCOUNT SECURITY

THROUGHOUT THE TRANSACTION PROCESS. BY ESTABLISHING PCI CO. TO MANAGE THE PCI DATA SECURITY

STANDARD, WE AND THE OTHER FOUNDERS HAVE DEVELOPED A COMMON STANDARD THAT IS MORE ACCESSIBLE AND

EFFICIENT FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY. ALL MERCHANTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT

STORE, PROCESS AND TRANSMIT PAYMENT CARD DATA ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE PCI DATA SECURITY

STANDARD. PCI CO. IS DEDICATED TO DRIVING GREATER EDUCATION, AWARENESS AND ADOPTION OF THE PCI

DATA SECURITY STANDARD TO ENSURE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THE PAYMENT PROCESS CONDUCT

THEIR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY.

REGULATION

LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A

SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN

ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH SUCH ARRANGEMENTS EXIST, BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE

ALREADY LICENSED TO ISSUE GENERAL PURPOSE CARDS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR GNS PARTNERS HAVE GENERALLY NOT

HAD DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE

CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO GNS ARRANGEMENTS. AS A NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDER TO REGULATED U.S. BANKS, OUR

GNS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CERTAIN FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT

INSURANCE CORPORATION, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND THE OFFICE OF THRIFT

SUPERVISION. AS THE OPERATOR OF A GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE USA

PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE PATRIOT ACT), WHICH REQUIRES US TO CONDUCT DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR GNS

PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER

PROGRAMS TO PREVENT OUR NETWORK FROM BEING USED FOR MONEY LAUNDERING OR TERRORIST FINANCING.

GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES

WE OPERATE A GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT

CARDS, AND ACCEPTING AND PROCESSING CARD TRANSACTIONS AND PAYING MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS FOR

PURCHASES MADE BY CARDMEMBERS WITH CARDS (CHARGES). WE ALSO PROVIDE POINT-OF-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SALE AND BACK-OFFICE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND MARKETING PROGRAMS TO MERCHANTS, LEVERAGING THE

CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY OUR CLOSED LOOP STRUCTURE.

OUR

OBJECTIVE IS FOR CARDMEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE CARD WHEREVER AND HOWEVER THEY DESIRE,

AS WELL AS TO INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND IN SELECTED NEW INDUSTRIES

THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED GENERAL PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT.

WE ADD NEW MERCHANTS TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER OF SALES CHANNELS: A PROPRIETARY SALES FORCE,

THIRD-PARTY SALES AGENTS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH BANKS, THE INTERNET, TELEMARKETING AND INBOUND

WANT TO HONOR CALLS (I.E., MERCHANTS DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD CONTACTING US DIRECTLY).

SINCE THE EARLY 1990S, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR

CARD PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE

FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE USE OF OUR CARDS FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 64% OF OUR

U.S. BILLINGS CAME FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 36% CAME FROM RETAIL AND OTHER

SECTORS. THAT PROPORTION HAS NOW BEEN MORE THAN REVERSED. IN 2006, U.S. NON-TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT BILLINGS REPRESENTED OVER 65% OF THE U.S. BILLED BUSINESS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

THIS SHIFT RESULTED FROM THE GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS THAT BEGAN TO ACCEPT

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS INCREASED DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR MORE OF

THEIR PURCHASES, AND OUR FOCUS ON EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MEET CARDMEMBERS NEEDS.

DURING 2006, WE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO USE THE CARD FOR EVERYDAY

SPENDING. WE INCREASED THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF MERCHANTS IN RETAIL AND EVERYDAY SPENDING

CATEGORIES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD, SUCH AS QUICK-SERVE RESTAURANTS, MASS TRANSIT, HEALTHCARE AND

RECURRING BILLING MERCHANTS.

IN ADDITION, WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR DRIVE OF BRINGING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO INDUSTRIES WHERE CASH

OR CHECKS ARE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF PAYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE AREA OF REAL ESTATE, WE SIGNED

AN AGREEMENT WITH THE MOINIAN GROUP TO ALLOW DOWN-PAYMENTS FOR LUXURY CONDOMINIUMS TO BE CHARGED ON

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. CARD ACCEPTANCE FOR PRIVATE JETS AND RESIDENCE/DESTINATION CLUBS, AS

WELL AS BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS PURCHASES, ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF NEW INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE CARD IS

NOW ACCEPTED, AND WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE CARDMEMBER SPENDING.

GLOBALLY, ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS CONTINUES TO INCREASE,

INCLUDING AMONG MERCHANTS IN INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS. AS IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2006, WE CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE OF CARDS AROUND

THE WORLD AND TO REFINE OUR APPROACH TO CALCULATING MERCHANT COVERAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN

THE MARKETPLACE. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT, AS OF THE END OF 2006, OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE

UNITED STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN 90% OF CARDMEMBERS GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD

SPENDING, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT NETWORK AS A WHOLE ACCOMMODATED APPROXIMATELY 80% OF OUR

CARDMEMBERS GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE BASED ON

COMPARING OUR CARDMEMBERS SPENDING ON OUR NETWORK CURRENTLY WITH OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT OUR

CARDMEMBERS WOULD SPEND ON OUR NETWORK IF ALL MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT GENERAL PURPOSE CREDIT AND

CHARGE CARDS ACCEPTED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE EARN DISCOUNT REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AS PAYMENT FOR

GOODS OR SERVICES SOLD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS THE FEE CHARGED TO THE MERCHANT FOR ACCEPTING

CARDS AND IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE AMOUNT CHARGED ON A CARD. THE MERCHANT

DISCOUNT IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT THAT THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER (IN MOST

CASES, TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) PAYS TO A MERCHANT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A MERCHANT

ACQUIRER IS THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE MERCHANT, ACCEPTS TRANSACTIONS

FROM THE MERCHANT, PAYS THE MERCHANT FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS THROUGH

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK TO THE APPROPRIATE CARD ISSUER FOR BILLING TO THE CARDMEMBER. WHEN A

CARDMEMBER PRESENTS THE CARD FOR PAYMENT, THE MERCHANT CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR THE

TRANSACTION AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT TRS OR ONE OF

ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT

REVENUE AT THE POINT-OF-SALE.

WHERE WE ACT AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE CARD PRESENTED AT A MERCHANT IS ISSUED BY A

THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF OUR GNS PARTNERS, WE WILL MAKE

FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT TO THE MERCHANT AND RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT REVENUE. IN OUR ROLE AS THE OPERATOR

OF THE CARD NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO RECEIVE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT FROM THE CARD ISSUER, WHO RETAINS AN

ISSUER RATE (I.E., THE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AMOUNT THAT CARD ISSUERS RECEIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS

CHARGED ON OUR NETWORK WITH CARDS THAT THEY ISSUE, WHICH IS USUALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF

THE CHARGED AMOUNT). THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT REVENUE (RECEIVED BY US IN THE FORM OF

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT) AND THE ISSUER RATE RECEIVED BY THE CARD ISSUER GENERATES A RETURN TO US.

WHERE WE ARE THE CARD ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION (WHICH CAN BE THE CASE IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH THE IO IS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER), WE

RECEIVE AN ISSUER RATE IN OUR SETTLEMENT WITH THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WHICH IS RECORDED BY US AS

DISCOUNT REVENUE.

THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMS DEPICT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE PARTIES IN A POINT-OF-SALE

TRANSACTION EFFECTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK WHERE WE ACT AS BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND

MERCHANT ACQUIRER (THE 3-PARTY MODEL) AND UNDER AN NCL ARRANGEMENT WHERE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ACT AS CARD ISSUERS (THE NCL MODEL).

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE THAT WE CHARGE IS PRINCIPALLY DETERMINED BY THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO

THE MERCHANT AND GENERALLY REPRESENTS A PREMIUM OVER OTHER NETWORKS.

WE DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO THE

MERCHANT THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS RELATIVE TO CARDS ISSUED ON

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETING CARD NETWORKS, THE OVERALL HIGHER VOLUME OF SPENDING BY ALL CARDMEMBERS, MARKETING

EXPERTISE, AND CARDMEMBERS INSISTENCE ON USING THEIR CARDS WHEN ENROLLED IN REWARDS OR OTHER CARD

LOYALTY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THOSE AS PART OF OUR CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM.

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE VARIES WITH THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE MERCHANT DOES BUSINESS, THE

CHARGE VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT TO THE MERCHANT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF

CHARGES AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF THE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT SIGNED

WITH US (LOCAL OR GLOBAL) AND THE CHARGE AMOUNT. IN 2006, AS IN PRIOR

YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SOME REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE,

PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF SELECTIVE REPRICING INITIATIVES, CONTINUED CHANGES IN THE MIX

OF BUSINESS AND VOLUME-RELATED PRICING ADJUSTMENTS. WE EXPECT THAT THE EFFECT OF THESE FACTORS WILL

LIKELY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN SOME EROSION OVER TIME OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE,

PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WHILE MOST MERCHANTS UNDERSTAND OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE PRICING IN RELATION TO THE VALUE

PROVIDED, WE DO ENCOUNTER A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, BUT TELL

THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER TO ACCEPT ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT AND, CONSEQUENTLY, SUPPRESS USE

OF THE CARD. WE RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE AGGRESSIVELY TO ENSURE THAT OUR CARDMEMBERS ARE ABLE TO USE

THEIR CARD WHERE AND WHEN THEY WANT TO. WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS BY: CONCENTRATING ON ACQUIRING

MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD; CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE PROVIDE BY

PROGRAMS SUCH AS AMERICAN EXPRESS SELECTS

®

AND MY WISHLIST, WHICH ENABLE

MERCHANTS TO GAIN VALUABLE EXPOSURE AND ADDITIONAL SALES BY PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE OFFERS AND

EXPERIENCES TO AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS; PROVIDING BETTER AND EARLIER COMMUNICATION OF OUR

VALUE PROPOSITION; AND, WHEN NECESSARY, CANCELLING MERCHANTS WHO SUPPRESS THE USE OF OUR CARD

PRODUCTS.

IN THE CASE OF MY WISHLIST, A SEASONAL WEB SITE WE DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MERCHANT

PARTNERS, WE ARE ABLE TO GREATLY ENHANCE OUR MERCHANT VALUE. THROUGH THE SITE, WE PROVIDE

CARDMEMBERS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO BUY A LIMITED NUMBER OF SOUGHT-AFTER ITEMS, SUCH AS AUTOMOBILES,

TRIPS, ELECTRONICS AND JEWELRY, AT A FRACTION OF THEIR RETAIL PRICES, AS WELL AS ACCESS TO NUMEROUS

OFFERS FROM TOP BRANDS. THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS SELECTS, WE MAKE AVAILABLE TO OUR CARDMEMBERS

HIGH QUALITY SHOPPING, DINING AND TRAVEL VALUES FROM MERCHANTS ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND THESE

MERCHANTS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH OUT TO OUR CARDMEMBERS.

MERCHANT SATISFACTION IS A KEY GOAL OF OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES BUSINESS. WE FOCUS ON

UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MERCHANT SATISFACTION, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND

EXECUTING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS, USING TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES,

OUR CLOSED LOOP AND DEEP MARKETING EXPERTISE AND STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS

THROUGH AN EXPANDING ROSTER OF SERVICES THAT HELP THEM MEET THEIR BUSINESS GOALS. WE OFFER A FULL

RANGE OF POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATED POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS AND DIRECT LINKS

THAT ALLOW MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AS WELL AS BANKCARDS, DEBIT CARDS AND

CHECKS, AND CONTACTLESS POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS THAT ENABLE MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CONTACTLESS PAYMENT

PRODUCTS INCLUDING OUR EXPRESSPAY FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

PRODUCTS. VIRTUALLY ALL PROPRIETARY POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS

SUPPORT DIRECT PROCESSING (I.E., DIRECT CONNECTIVITY) TO AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH LOWERS A

MERCHANTS COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE AND AVOIDS PAYMENT DELAYS CAUSED BY A THIRD PARTY.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPRESSPAY,

A CONTACTLESS PAYMENT FEATURE, IS DESIGNED TO BE A FAST, EASY-TO-USE

ALTERNATIVE FOR MAKING EVERYDAY PURCHASES AT MERCHANTS WHERE SPEED

AND CONVENIENCE IS IMPORTANT. EXPRESSPAY IS NOW ACCEPTED AT OVER 30,000 PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES,

INCLUDING TOP QUICK-SERVICE RESTAURANT, MOVIE THEATER, DRUG STORE AND CONVENIENCE STORE CHAINS.

EXPRESSPAY, POWERED BY RADIO-FREQUENCY TECHNOLOGY, IS AVAILABLE BOTH IN A KEY-FOB FORM AND HAS BEEN

INTRODUCED WITHIN SEVERAL CARD PRODUCTS. IN 2006, WE EXPANDED MERCHANT COVERAGE OF EXPRESSPAY BY

PARTNERING WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE UTAH TRANSIT AUTHORITY, JACK IN THE BOX, AND ARBYS

RESTAURANT GROUP, INC. AT PARTICIPATING LOCATIONS.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON THE FAST-GROWING RECURRING BILLING INDUSTRY THROUGH

AUTOMATIC BILL PAYMENT, A SERVICE THAT ALLOWS MERCHANTS TO BILL CARDMEMBERS ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR

RECURRING CHARGES SUCH AS INSURANCE PREMIUMS, NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTIONS, HEALTH CLUB MEMBERSHIPS,

COMMUTATION COSTS AND CABLE TELEVISION SERVICE. WE HAVE ALSO MADE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR HOST AUTHORIZATION

SYSTEM TO APPROVE MORE TRANSACTIONS AND REDUCE CARDMEMBER INCONVENIENCE AT THE POINT-OF-SALE

WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN FRAUD OR CREDIT LOSSES.

WHEREVER WE MANAGE BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS AND THE CARD ISSUING SIDE OF

THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A CLOSED LOOP, WHICH DISTINGUISHES OUR NETWORK FROM THE BANKCARD NETWORKS

IN THAT THERE IS ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD TRANSACTION. WE MAINTAIN A DIRECT

RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH OUR CARDMEMBERS AND OUR MERCHANTS, AND WE HANDLE ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THOSE

RELATIONSHIPS. OUR RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW US TO ANALYZE INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBERS SPEND. THIS

ENABLES US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A

VARIETY OF CHANNELS, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. WE

PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS DATA, AND COMPLY WITH STRICT PRIVACY, FIREWALL AND APPLICABLE

LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CARD ISSUING BANK PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS CLOSED

LOOP, WHICH PERMITS THEM TO CUSTOMIZE MARKETING EFFORTS, DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO THEIR CARDMEMBERS

AND HELP US TO DIRECT INCREASED BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT THE CARD.

AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WE HAVE CERTAIN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES THAT ARISE IF A BILLING

DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE CARDMEMBER. DRIVERS OF THIS

LIABILITY ARE RETURNS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER FRAUDULENT CHARGES, THE

QUALITY OR NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, WE OFFSET THE AMOUNT

DUE TO THE CARDMEMBER AGAINST PAYMENTS FOR THE MERCHANTS CURRENT OR FUTURE CHARGE SUBMISSIONS. WE

CAN REALIZE LOSSES WHEN OFFSETTING SUBMISSIONS CEASE, SUCH AS WHEN THE MERCHANT COMMENCES A

BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE

RISK OF THIS EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN

MERCHANT BY REQUIRING A PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE OR LETTER OF CREDIT, HOLDING CASH RESERVES FUNDED

THROUGH CHARGE PAYABLE HOLDBACKS FROM A MERCHANT, LENGTHENING THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE MERCHANT

SUBMITS A CHARGE FOR PAYMENT AND WHEN WE PAY THE MERCHANT OR IMPLEMENTING OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK

MANAGEMENT TOOLS. WE ALSO ESTABLISH RESERVES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THIRD-PARTY

PROCESSORS AND SOME BANKCARD ACQUIRERS HAVE BEGUN TO OFFER MERCHANTS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVERTING

CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF THE CARDHOLDERS RESIDENCE

(I.E., THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE POINT-OF-SALE, AND SUBMITTING THE TRANSACTION IN

THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION

PROCESS OF THE CARD NETWORK. THIS PRACTICE IS KNOWN AS DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION. IF A

MERCHANT UTILIZES A DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS, THE MERCHANT AND PROCESSOR SHARE ANY FEE

ASSESSED OR SPREAD EARNED FOR CONVERTING THE TRANSACTION AT THE POINT OF SALE, THUS REDUCING OR

ELIMINATING REVENUE FOR CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION OF FOREIGN

CHARGES TO THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY. THIS PRACTICE IS NOT WIDESPREAD, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN

TO WHAT EXTENT CONSUMERS WILL PREFER TO HAVE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS CONVERTED BY MERCHANTS

IN THIS WAY. OUR POLICY GENERALLY REQUIRES MERCHANTS TO SUBMIT CHARGES AND BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY

OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND WE CONVERT THE TRANSACTION TO THE CARDMEMBERS

BILLING CURRENCY.

COMPETITION

OUR NETWORK COMPETES WITH OTHER CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB (WHICH, IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, HAS BEEN FOLDED INTO THE

NETWORK OPERATED BY MASTERCARD), DISCOVER, A BUSINESS UNIT OF MORGAN STANLEY (PRIMARILY IN THE

UNITED STATES), AND JCB CO., LTD. (PRIMARILY IN ASIA). WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST GENERAL PURPOSE

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH ARE LARGER

THAN WE ARE IN MOST MARKETS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK AND MERCHANT SERVICE BUSINESS

INCLUDE.



THE NUMBER OF CARDS-IN-FORCE AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THESE CARDS;



THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THE CARDS CAN BE USED;



THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS OF

PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK;



THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS;



REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION;



INNOVATION IN SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS;



THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE;



THE SECURITY OF CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT INFORMATION; AND



COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE RELATIVE TO THE VALUE PROVIDED.

ANOTHER ASPECT OF NETWORK COMPETITION IS THE RECENT EMERGENCE AND RAPID GROWTH OF ALTERNATIVE

PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDE AGGREGATORS (SUCH AS PAYPAL), WIRELESS PAYMENT

TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), PRE-PAID

SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO CREDIT CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS. IN THE UNITED STATES, A

CREDIT PUSH PAYMENT MECHANISM IS BEING DEVELOPED TO RE-DIRECT ONLINE CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT

SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH (AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE, I.E., INTER-BANK

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRANSFER), AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY,

WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE.

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE OUR CLOSED LOOP STRUCTURE, SUCH AS VISAS

VISA INCENTIVE NETWORK. ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE VISA WILL BE, EFFORTS BY VISA

AND OTHER CARD NETWORKS AND PAYMENT PROVIDERS TO REPLICATE THE CLOSED LOOP SPEAK BOTH TO ITS

CONTINUED VALUE, AS WELL AS THE INTENSE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

REGULATION

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE

OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, POLAND, GERMANY, SPAIN, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA, MEXICO AND

SWITZERLAND, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED, AND ARE CONTINUING TO CONDUCT, INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE

WAY BANKCARD NETWORK MEMBERS COLLECTIVELY SET THE INTERCHANGE, WHICH IS THE FEE PAID BY THE

BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK. THE INTERCHANGE FEE IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST

COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS BY THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR BANKCARD

DEBIT AND CREDIT CHARGES. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD

AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE BANKCARD

ASSOCIATIONS PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. DOWNWARD MOVEMENT OF INTERCHANGE AND

MERCHANT DISCOUNT FEES MAY AFFECT THE RELATIVE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT

ACQUIRERS OF PARTICIPATION IN A PARTICULAR NETWORK. LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT

REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS ANNUAL CARD FEES, AS

WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS. IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES

WHERE ANTITRUST ACTIONS OR REGULATIONS HAVE FORCED OUR COMPETITORS TO LOWER THEIR FEES, WE HAVE

MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR OWN FEE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS TO REFLECT LOCAL COMPETITIVE TRENDS.

FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCTIONS IN BANKCARD INTERCHANGE MANDATED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA REFORMS

IN 2003 HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR VISA AND MASTERCARD. AS A RESULT OF

CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, WE HAVE REDUCED OUR OWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES IN AUSTRALIA ALTHOUGH

WE HAVE NEVERTHELESS BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE BILLED BUSINESS AND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING

OUR CARDS. IN ADDITION, UNDER LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ARGENTINA, A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS REQUIRED TO

CHARGE THE SAME MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE TO ALL MERCHANTS IN THE SAME INDUSTRY CATEGORY, AND MERCHANT

DISCOUNT RATES CANNOT EXCEED 3%.

IN ITS FINAL REPORT ON THE RETAIL BANKING SECTOR ISSUED IN JANUARY 2007, WHICH INCLUDED REVIEW

OF THE PAYMENT CARDS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION APPEARS TO FAVOR

COMPETITION LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOLS, RATHER THAN REGULATING PRICE LEVELS, AS THE PREFERRED MEANS TO

ADDRESS PERCEIVED ISSUES OF INSUFFICIENT COMPETITION IN THE EUROPEAN PAYMENT CARDS INDUSTRY. THE CONCLUSIONS

OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AS EXPRESSED IN ITS FINAL REPORT DO NOT HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW, BUT MAY

BE USED AS THE BASIS FOR FUTURE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES. IN

2007, AS AN EXAMPLE, THE COMPETITION REGULATOR IN POLAND FOUND INSUFFICIENT BASIS FOR VISA AND

MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE FEES AND ORDERED THE ASSOCIATIONS TO STOP THEIR CURRENT INTERCHANGE SETTING

PRACTICES, AND THE BANKS ARE APPEALING THAT DECISION.

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND VARIOUS FEDERAL

RESERVE BANKS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS ON INTERCHANGE AND HAVE HELD SEVERAL CONFERENCES

FOCUSED ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE RATES. WHILE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN

MONITORING THIS ISSUE, IT HAS NOT INDICATED THE NEED TO REGULATE INTERCHANGE RATES IN THE UNITED

STATES. IN CONGRESS, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HEARINGS ON VISA/MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE OVER THE LAST

YEAR. DURING 2006, THERE WERE ALSO A NUMBER OF BILLS PROPOSED IN INDIVIDUAL STATE LEGISLATURES

SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE OR TO PROHIBIT CARD COMPANIES FROM CHARGING

MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE STATE TAX PORTION OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. NONE OF THOSE BILLS WAS

ENACTED. IT IS EXPECTED THAT CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS AND SIMILAR PROPOSED STATE LEGISLATION WILL

CONTINUE DURING 2007. IN THE EVENT THAT GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE

CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

REGULATORS, INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, HAVE CONSIDERED THE INDUSTRY

PRACTICE OF PROHIBITING MERCHANTS FROM PASSING THE COST OF MERCHANT DISCOUNT FEES ALONG TO

CONSUMERS THROUGH SURCHARGES ON CARD PURCHASES. ALTHOUGH SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE UNITED

KINGDOM, HAVE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS PERMITTED MERCHANTS TO LEVY A SURCHARGE ON CREDIT CARD

PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT SURCHARGES WERE CLEARLY DISCLOSED, THERE HAS TO DATE BEEN A RELATIVELY LOW

OVERALL INCIDENCE OF SURCHARGING, AS MERCHANTS DO NOT WANT TO RISK OFFENDING CUSTOMERS OR LOSING

THEM TO COMPETITORS THAT DO NOT ASSESS SURCHARGES FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. IN ITS FINAL REPORT,

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION INDICATED THAT PROHIBITING SURCHARGING APPEARED TO RESTRICT INTER-NETWORK

COMPETITION AND MAY CONSTITUTE A BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR ALTERNATIVE, NON-CASH PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS.

IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE SEEN SELECTIVE MERCHANT SURCHARGING IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS GREATER THAN APPLIED TO THE BANKCARD

NETWORKS.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WILL LIKELY BE ENACTING A NEW LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVE THAT WILL PUT IN

PLACE A LICENSING AND SUPERVISION FRAMEWORK FOR ALL ELECTRONIC PAYMENT METHODS IN THE EUROPEAN

UNION OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE A SINGLE, INTERNAL

PAYMENTS MARKET THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE DIRECTIVE WILL LIKELY BE FINALIZED IN 2007 AND

ADOPTED AS LEGISLATION IN THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THROUGH TO THE END OF 2008. BY

2010, LICENSING WILL BE REQUIRED AND SUPERVISION WILL COMMENCE FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD OPERATIONS

IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. ONE PROVISION OF THIS DRAFT DIRECTIVE GIVES MERCHANTS THE RIGHT TO

SURCHARGE, SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. AT THE SAME TIME, NEW TECHNICAL STANDARDS ARE BEING

ADOPTED BY THE INDUSTRY. ALL OF THE FOREGOING WILL ENTAIL COSTS TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN.

U.S. CARD SERVICES

SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE A WIDE RANGE OF CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN

CHARGE CARDS

OUR CHARGE CARDS, WHICH CARRY NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD

OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES. CHARGES ARE APPROVED

BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A CARDMEMBERS CURRENT SPENDING PATTERNS, PAYMENT HISTORY,

CREDIT RECORD, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. CARDMEMBERS GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH

MONTH, AND NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED ON THE BALANCE. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST DUE

ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY

BE CANCELLED. THE NO PRESET-SPENDING LIMIT AND PAY-IN-FULL NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS ATTRACT

HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS WHO WANT TO USE A CHARGE CARD TO FACILITATE LARGER PAYMENTS.

THE CHARGE CARDS ALSO OFFER ENROLLMENT SERVICES TO CARDMEMBERS. THE SIGN &

TRAVEL

®

PROGRAM GIVES QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDED

PAYMENTS FOR AIRLINE, CRUISE AND CERTAIN TRAVEL CHARGES THAT ARE PURCHASED WITH OUR CHARGE CARDS.

THE EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION OFFERS QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDING PAYMENT FOR

CERTAIN CHARGES ON THE CHARGE CARD IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED AMOUNT.

REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS

WE OFFER A VARIETY OF REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS. THESE CARDS HAVE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT PAYMENT

TERMS, GRACE PERIODS AND RATE AND FEE STRUCTURES. SINCE LATE 1994, OUR LENDING BALANCE GROWTH HAS BEEN AMONG THE

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TOP TIER OF CARD ISSUERS. MUCH OF THIS GROWTH HAS BEEN DUE TO THE BREADTH OF OUR LENDING

PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, BLUE CASH FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS

AND THE DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, AS WELL AS THE INCREASED NUMBER OF CHARGE

CARDMEMBERS WHO HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR LENDING ON CHARGE OPTIONS (SUCH AS THE SIGN & TRAVEL

AND EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION PROGRAMS DESCRIBED ABOVE).

COBRAND CARDS

WE ISSUE CARDS UNDER COBRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE COMPETITION AMONG CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS FOR ATTRACTIVE COBRAND CARD PARTNERSHIPS IS QUITE

INTENSE BECAUSE THEY CAN GENERATE HIGH-SPENDING LOYAL CARDHOLDERS. THE DURATION OF OUR COBRAND

ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM FIVE TO TEN YEARS. CARDMEMBERS EARN REWARDS PROVIDED BY THE

PARTNERS RESPECTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR SPENDING ON THE COBRAND CARDS, SUCH AS

FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY POINTS AND CASH BACK. WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR COBRAND

PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND

CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF

ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. WE EXPENSE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MONTH

EARNED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. GENERALLY, ONCE WE MAKE

PAYMENT TO THE COBRAND PARTNER, THE PARTNER IS SOLELY LIABLE FOR PROVIDING

REWARDS TO THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE COBRAND PARTNERS OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM. AS THE ISSUER OF THE

COBRAND CARD, WE RETAIN ALL THE CREDIT RISK WITH THE CARDMEMBER AND BEAR THE RECEIVABLES FUNDING

AND OPERATING EXPENSES FOR SUCH CARDS. THE COBRAND PARTNER RETAINS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE

MILES, POINTS OR OTHER CURRENCY EARNED BY THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE PARTNERS LOYALTY PROGRAM.

COBRAND PARTNERSHIPS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS

WE ALSO ISSUE CARDS THAT ARE MARKETED UNDER COBRAND PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL

SERVICES PARTNERS. SUCH PARTNERSHIPS INVOLVE THE OFFERING OF A STANDARD PRODUCT (ISSUED BY TRS OR

ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) TO CUSTOMERS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNER, GENERALLY COBRANDED WITH

THE PARTNERS NAME ON THE CARD. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES PARTNERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED THROUGH

THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON SUCH CARDS. THE DURATION OF SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.

FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2005 WE ESTABLISHED AN ALLIANCE WITH GUARANTY BANK TO DISTRIBUTE COBRANDED

CARDS TO GUARANTYS SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT ITS BRANCH NETWORK IN TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA.

IN 2006, WE EXPANDED THIS PARTNERSHIP TO INCLUDE A COBRANDED AMERICAN EXPRESS PREFERRED REWARDS

GOLD CARD, TO BE OFFERED TO GUARANTY BANKS CONSUMER CUSTOMERS AT ITS VARIOUS LOCATIONS. THIS PAST

YEAR, WE ALSO ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC BANK PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN OPEN FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND

SOVEREIGN BANK, UNDER WHICH SOVEREIGN WILL OFFER AMERICAN EXPRESS BUSINESS CARDS TO SMALL BUSINESS

CUSTOMERS IN THE NORTHEAST.

CARD PRICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

CERTAIN OF OUR CARDS, PARTICULARLY CHARGE CARDS, CHARGE AN ANNUAL FEE THAT VARIES BASED ON THE

TYPE OF CARD AND THE NUMBER OF CARDS FOR EACH ACCOUNT. WE ALSO OFFER MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS

WITH NO ANNUAL FEE BUT ON WHICH WE ASSESS FINANCE CHARGES FOR REVOLVING BALANCES. DEPENDING ON THE

PRODUCT, WE ALSO CHARGE CARDMEMBER FEES TO PARTICIPATE IN REWARDS PROGRAMS, FOR ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE

(E.G., LATE FEES) OR FOR CERTAIN SERVICES (E.G., ADDITIONAL COPIES OF ACCOUNT STATEMENTS). WE

APPLY STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR CREDITWORTHINESS TO EACH CARDMEMBER THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS

BOTH AT THE TIME OF INITIAL SOLICITATION OR APPLICATION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING THE CARD

RELATIONSHIP. WE USE SOPHISTICATED CREDIT MODELS AND TECHNIQUES IN OUR RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS

AND BELIEVE THAT OUR STRONG RISK MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES PROVIDE US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

ALSO REDESIGNED OUR WEB SITE TO DELIVER ENHANCED CAPABILITIES. IN 2007, WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A

TIERED STRUCTURE THAT WILL INCLUDE TAILORED REWARDS OFFERINGS AND

SERVICES FOR OUR PREMIUM CARDS.

WHEN A CARDMEMBER ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM USES THE CARD, WE ESTABLISH

RESERVES TO COVER THE COST OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REWARD REDEMPTIONS FOR POINTS EARNED TO DATE. WHEN

A MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ENROLLEE REDEEMS A REWARD USING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS, WE MAKE A

PAYMENT TO THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM PARTNER PROVIDING THE REWARD PURSUANT TO CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS. BECAUSE OF HIGHER CHARGE VOLUMES AND INCREASED CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION IN MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS, THE EXPENSE OF THE PROGRAM HAS INCREASED BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND CONTINUES TO GROW.

DESPITE THE INCREASING COSTS OF THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM AS PENETRATION AND USAGE

EXPAND, IT PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN OUR PROFITABILITY. THE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT

DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND LOYALTY. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THAT

CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS PROGRAMS YIELD HIGHER SPEND, STRONGER CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND

GREATER PROFIT FOR US. FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD THROUGH THE END OF 2006, TOTAL SPENDING BY U.S.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PARTICIPANTS INCREASED BY 66%. BY OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION

CHOICES, WE HAVE GIVEN OUR CARDMEMBERS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THEIR REWARDS POINTS AND

FAVORABLY AFFECTED OUR AVERAGE COST PER POINT. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO OPTIMIZE THE OVERALL

ECONOMICS OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS. OUR PROGRAM IS ALSO

VALUABLE TO MERCHANTS THAT BECOME REDEMPTION PARTNERS AS WE BRING THEM HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS

AND NEW MARKETING CHANNELS TO REACH THESE CARDMEMBERS.

CARDMEMBER SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, OUR CARDMEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF FEE-FREE AND FEE-BASED

COMPETITION  CARD ISSUING BUSINESS

OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INTENSE COMPETITION. AS A CARD

ISSUER, WE COMPETE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIBANK, BANK OF

AMERICA, JPMORGAN CHASE, AND CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL) THAT ISSUE GENERAL PURPOSE CREDIT CARDS,

PRIMARILY UNDER REVOLVING CREDIT PLANS, AND THE MORGAN STANLEY AFFILIATE THAT ISSUES THE DISCOVER

CARD ON THE DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES NETWORK. WE ALSO ENCOUNTER LIMITED COMPETITION FROM

BUSINESSES THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS

RETAILERS AND AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS ARE NOT GENERALLY SUBSTITUTES FOR OUR

CARDS BECAUSE OF THEIR LIMITED ACCEPTANCE. BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND

FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE

ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS AND THE LARGEST ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN

SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH

NETWORKS.

COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT CARDHOLDERS,

INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT, AIRLINE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM

MILEAGE CREDITS, CASH REBATES AND OTHER REWARD OR REBATE PROGRAMS, SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESS

OWNERS, TEASER PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CREDIT CARD ACQUISITION AND BALANCE TRANSFERS,

AND COBRANDED ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS. IN RECENT YEARS WE

HAVE ENCOUNTERED INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR, AS COMPETITORS

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HAVE TARGETED OPENS CUSTOMER BASE AS A RESULT OF OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN PROVIDING

FINANCIAL SERVICES TO SMALL BUSINESSES.

MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ALSO ISSUE DEBIT CARDS TO

PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES HAS GROWN

AS MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING

EITHER THE VISA OR MASTERCARD LOGO. AS A RESULT, THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS

IN THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AND, IN THE UNITED STATES, HAS GROWN

MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS. DEBIT CARDS ARE MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS

FOR CASH AND CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS ARE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS.

THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE DEBIT CARDS FOR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS IS LIMITED BECAUSE THE CONSUMER

MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN HIS OR HER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TO COVER THE TRANSACTION IN

QUESTION. FOR EXAMPLE, LARGER PURCHASES OR DELAYED PURCHASES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR DEBIT

CARDS. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ISSUE POINT-OF-SALE DEBIT CARDS FOR USE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS ARE.



THE FEATURES AND THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING REWARDS PROGRAMS,

PROVIDED TO CARDMEMBERS;



THE NUMBER, SPENDING CHARACTERISTICS AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF CARDMEMBERS;



THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT

CARDS;



THE COST OF CARDS TO CARDMEMBERS;



PRICING, PAYMENT AND OTHER CARD ACCOUNT TERMS AND CONDITIONS;



THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF OTHER PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO CARDMEMBERS;



THE NATURE AND QUALITY OF EXPENSE MANAGEMENT DATA CAPTURE AND REPORTING

CAPABILITY;



THE SUCCESS OF TARGETED MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS;



REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION;



THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS TO MANAGE CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK THROUGHOUT

THE ECONOMIC CYCLE;



THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS TO IMPLEMENT OPERATIONAL AND COST EFFICIENCIES; AND



THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

AS THE PAYMENT INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO FACE COMPETITION FROM

NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS, SUCH AS ONLINE NETWORKS AND TELECOM PROVIDERS, THAT LEVERAGE NEW

TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE PAYMENT SOLUTIONS.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TRS, ALONG WITH ITS

SUBSIDIARIES (CREDCO), PURCHASES THE MAJORITY OF CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE USE OF

CARDS ISSUED IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN CERTAIN CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO

FINANCES THE PURCHASE OF RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE

SALE OF MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB FINANCE THEIR REVOLVING CREDIT

RECEIVABLES, IN PART, THROUGH THE SALE OF SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT

IN THE UNITED STATES. TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ALSO FUND RECEIVABLES THROUGH

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS. THE COST OF FUNDING CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A

MAJOR EXPENSE OF CARD OPERATIONS. (YOU CAN FIND A DISCUSSION OF TRS AND CENTURION BANKS

SECURITIZATION AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES ON PAGE 32,

PAGE 35, PAGES

43 - 48 AND PAGES 55 - 56 UNDER THE CAPTION FINANCIAL REVIEW, AND NOTE

5 ON PAGES 87 - 89 OF THE COMPANYS 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS WE INCORPORATE HEREIN BY REFERENCE.)

REGULATION  CARD ISSUING BUSINESS

THE CHARGE CARD AND CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION. IN THE

UNITED STATES, THE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING.



THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (WHICH GENERALLY PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION

IN THE GRANTING AND HANDLING OF CREDIT);



THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT (FCRA), AS AMENDED BY THE FAIR AND

ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT (FACT ACT) (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES USE

BY CREDITORS OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS AND CREDIT PRESCREENING PRACTICES AND REQUIRES

CERTAIN DISCLOSURES WHEN AN APPLICATION FOR CREDIT IS REJECTED);



THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT (TILA) (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES

EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS UPON WHICH CREDIT IS GRANTED), INCLUDING THE

AMENDMENTS TO TILA THAT WERE ADOPTED THROUGH THE ENACTMENT OF THE FAIR CREDIT AND

CHARGE CARD DISCLOSURE ACT (WHICH MANDATES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ON CREDIT AND CHARGE

CARD APPLICATIONS);



THE FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES THE

MANNER THAT BILLING INQUIRIES ARE HANDLED AND SPECIFIES CERTAIN BILLING REQUIREMENTS);

AND



THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACT (WHICH REGULATES DISCLOSURES AND

SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS INCLUDING THOSE AT ATMS).

CERTAIN FEDERAL PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER

INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SEE CORPORATE AND OTHER BELOW). FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALSO

REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION,

AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE SIGNIFICANT

CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION AND DISCLOSURE AND PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN THE UNITED

STATES). THE APPLICATION OF BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS AFFECT US TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH

LAWS RESULT IN AMOUNTS OWED BEING CLASSIFIED AS DELINQUENT AND/OR CHARGED OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE.

CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION,

INCLUDING, IN THE UNITED STATES, THE PATRIOT ACT. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS LEGISLATION AND ITS

EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE REGULATION IN THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES SECTION ABOVE AND SEE

CORPORATE AND OTHER BELOW.)

CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB AND OUR OTHER BANK ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THE

REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THEREOF COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE

CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR CARD AND

LENDING BUSINESSES OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND ROBUST. MORE RECENTLY, THE U.S.

CONGRESS, AS WELL AS REGULATORS AND VARIOUS CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS, HAVE BEGUN INCREASING FOCUS

AND ATTENTION ON THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF FEES CHARGED BY CARD ISSUERS FOR,

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMONG OTHER THINGS, LATE PAYMENTS, RETURNED CHECKS, PAYMENTS BY TELEPHONE, COPIES OF

STATEMENTS AND THE LIKE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REFINE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN

LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS SO WE CAN

CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND

EXPECTATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL (THE FFIEC), AN

INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE TO THE INDUSTRY ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND

LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES (THE GUIDANCE). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE AREAS: (I) CREDIT LINE

MANAGEMENT, (II) OVER-LIMIT PRACTICES, (III) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION PRACTICES,

(IV) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES, AND (V) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE

PRACTICES. THE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE

FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT COMPRISE THE FFIEC, ALTHOUGH IT IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

THE IDENTIFICATION BY BANK REGULATORS IN THEIR EXAMINATIONS OF OTHER CREDIT CARD LENDERS PRACTICES

DEEMED BY THEM TO BE INAPPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, WITH REGARD TO SUBPRIME

LENDING PROGRAMS. AT PRESENT, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY LENDING PROGRAMS

THAT TARGET THE SUBPRIME MARKET. CENTURION BANK AND

AEBFSB EVALUATE AND DISCUSS THE GUIDANCE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS

PART OF THEIR REGULATORY EXAMINATION PROCESSES, AND, AS A RESULT, MAY REFINE THEIR PRACTICES FROM

TIME TO TIME BASED ON REGULATORY INPUT. THE GUIDANCE HAS NOT HAD, NOR

DO WE EXPECT IT TO HAVE, ANY MATERIAL

IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES.

GLOBAL TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID SERVICES (TCPS)

WE HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF ISSUING AND SELLING TRAVELERS CHECKS SINCE 1891. IN ADDITION

TO TRAVELERS CHECKS, WE ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, INCLUDING RELOADABLE AND

NON-RELOADABLE PREPAID CARDS AND, THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS INCENTIVE SERVICES L.L.C., A JOINT

VENTURE WITH MARITZ INC., WE OFFER VARIOUS INCENTIVE PREPAID PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE CORPORATE GIFT

CHEQUE, THE INCENTIVE FUNDS CARD AND SEVERAL POINTS-BASED INCENTIVE CARDS.

WE SELL THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

TRAVELERS CHEQUE (TRAVELERS CHEQUE OR

CHEQUE) AS A SAFE AND CONVENIENT ALTERNATIVE TO CASH. TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE AVAILABLE IN EIGHT

CURRENCIES, INCLUDING EUROS. WE ALSO ISSUE AND SELL OTHER FORMS OF PAPER TRAVELERS CHECKS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

GIFT CHEQUES, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN U.S. AND CANADIAN

DOLLARS, AND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CHEQUE-SECURE FUNDS, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN DOLLARS AND EUROS,

AND ARE OFFERED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES AS A SAFE WAY TO KEEP CASH AT HOME. SALES OF TRAVELERS

CHEQUES DECLINED SLIGHTLY IN 2006, REFLECTING THE MIGRATION OF THE PREPAID BUSINESS TOWARD PLASTIC.

TCPS OFFERS PREPAID GIFT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES: THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

GIFT CARD (GIFT

CARD), WHICH CAN BE USED IN THE UNITED STATES AT BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS,

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN USAGE LIMITATIONS, AND MALL-BRANDED GIFT CARDS, WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

FOR USE SOLELY AT MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD AND THAT ARE LOCATED WITHIN A

SPECIFIC SHOPPING MALL. OUR GIFT CARDS ARE NOW SOLD THROUGH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AND WE ADDED MANY NEW ONES DURING THE YEAR, INCLUDING

GAS STATIONS, RETAIL BANK BRANCHES AND GROCERY STORES. SALES OF GIFT CARDS CONTINUED TO RISE,

REFLECTING THE GROWING POPULARITY OF THESE PRODUCTS AND OUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE BUYING CONVENIENCE

FOR CUSTOMERS.

WE ALSO CONTINUED TO OFFER THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE CARD (TCC), A RELOADABLE, PREPAID CARD

MARKETED AS A PLASTIC FORM OF OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUE. DURING 2006, THE TCC WAS SOLD IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY, IN U.S. DOLLARS, BRITISH POUNDS STERLING AND EUROS,

RESPECTIVELY, FOR USE WORLDWIDE, FOR BOTH ONLINE AND IN-PERSON PURCHASES AND AT ATMS (ATM FEES

APPLY) THAT ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. TCC HOLDERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME CUSTOMER SERVICE

AND SECURITY PROVIDED TO HOLDERS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES, INCLUDING CARD REPLACEMENT OR REFUND IF THE

TCC IS LOST OR STOLEN (USUALLY WITHIN 24 HOURS).

WE SELL AMERICAN EXPRESS PAPER AND PLASTIC PREPAID PRODUCTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS. WE

SELL THESE PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS VIA PHONE AND THE INTERNET. TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND GIFT

CHEQUES ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH A BROAD NETWORK OF SELLING OUTLETS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AMERICAN

EXPRESS TRAVEL OFFICES, INDEPENDENT TRAVEL AGENTS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND MANY OTHER

FINANCIAL, TRAVEL AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THE SAME SELLERS ALSO SELL OUR PREPAID CARDS.

WE SOMETIMES COMPENSATE SELLING OUTLETS FOR THEIR SALES.

IN 2006, WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR GIFT CARD RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK SIGNIFICANTLY TO

INCLUDE WALGREENS AND OFFICE DEPOT, AS WELL AS MORE THAN 2,500 LOCATIONS IN THE GROCERY CATEGORY,

MALLS AND LARGE NATIONAL RETAIL CHAINS. THESE SELLERS USE PREPAID CARD MERCHANDISE RACKS TO MARKET

AND SELL OUR GIFT CARDS.

COMPETITION  TRAVELERS CHECKS AND PREPAID CARDS

TRAVELERS CHEQUES COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CASH,

FOREIGN CURRENCY, CHECKS, OTHER BRANDS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, AND, INCREASINGLY, DEBIT AND ATM CARDS,

AS WELL AS CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS (EVEN THOUGH TRAVELERS CHECKS AND PREPAID CARDS ARE NOT

SUBSTITUTES FOR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS) AND, TO A LIMITED EXTENT, COMPETING PREPAID CARDS. THE

PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE TRAVELERS CHECK AND PREPAID CARD INDUSTRY ARE.



THE NUMBER AND LOCATION OF MERCHANTS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE FORM OF PAYMENT;



THE AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER OF OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT;



THE AMOUNT OF FEES CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER;



THE COMPENSATION PAID TO, AND FREQUENCY OF SETTLEMENT BY, SELLING OUTLETS;



THE ACCESSIBILITY OF SALES AND REFUNDS FOR THE PRODUCTS;



THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; AND



THE ABILITY TO SERVICE THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTORILY, INCLUDING FOR LOST OR

STOLEN INSTRUMENTS.

OUR PREPAID CARDS (OPEN-SYSTEM CARDS THAT CAN BE USED AT MULTIPLE UNAFFILIATED SELLERS OF

GOODS OR SERVICES) COMPETE WITH THE SAME PAYMENT METHODS DESCRIBED

ABOVE; HOWEVER, GIFT CARDS COMPETE

PRIMARILY WITH CASH, CHECKS AND OTHER OPEN-SYSTEM AND STORE-SPECIFIC GIFT CARDS.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATION  TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS

AS AN ISSUER OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, WE ARE REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE MONEY

TRANSMITTER OR SALE OF CHECK LAWS IN EFFECT IN MOST STATES. THESE LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHECK

(AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, PREPAID CARD) ISSUERS TO OBTAIN LICENSES, TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND

SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN HIGHLY-RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS,

AND TO PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. WE INVEST THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND

PREPAID CARDS ISSUED BY TRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW,

PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY-RATED DEBT

SECURITIES CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL

OBLIGATIONS. IN 2006, A FEW STATES (E.G., HAWAII AND NEW HAMPSHIRE) PASSED MONEY TRANSMITTER LAWS

FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND WE HAVE APPLIED FOR OR SECURED LICENSES IN EACH OF THESE JURISDICTIONS.

MANY STATES EXAMINE LICENSEES ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION, TRAVELERS CHECK ISSUERS ARE REQUIRED BY THE

LAWS OF MANY STATES TO COMPLY WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS UNDER WHICH SUCH

ISSUERS MUST PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY TRAVELERS CHECK THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED

AFTER 15 YEARS. A FEW STATES HAVE AMENDED THEIR ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS TO APPLY TO PREPAID CARDS.

IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, SOME STATES HAVE ENACTED LAWS PERTAINING TO THE ISSUANCE AND THE SALE

OF GIFT CARDS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY RESTRICTING THE FEES THAT

CONSUMERS CAN BE CHARGED OR THE EXPIRATION DATES THAT CAN APPLY TO GIFT CARDS. IN CERTAIN STATES

WHERE REGULATION HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO OFFER GIFT CARDS PROFITABLY, WE HAVE LIMITED OR

WITHDRAWN FROM SELLING THESE CARDS. FEDERAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELER CHECK ISSUERS AS MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES AND COMPLIANCE

WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY ISSUERS AND SELLING OUTLETS.

AT THIS TIME, STORED VALUE ISSUERS AND REDEEMERS, WHILE CONSIDERED TO BE MONEY SERVICE

BUSINESSES, ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER UNDER THESE REGULATIONS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE VARYING LICENSING

AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED

STATES.

OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IS WIDESPREAD, WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT SHARE IN THE MARKETS IN

WHICH WE OPERATE. WE FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THOSE MARKETS THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER US THE GREATEST

FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY.

THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO BOLSTER ITS INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS THROUGH THE

LAUNCH OF NUMEROUS NEW OR ENHANCED CARD PRODUCTS DURING 2006. THESE ARE CARDS THAT WE ISSUE,

EITHER ON OUR OWN OR, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW, AS COBRANDS WITH PARTNERING INSTITUTIONS. THIS

PAST YEAR, AMONG OTHER NEW PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE ANNOUNCED OR LAUNCHED.



THE AMERICAN EXPRESS RED CARD

®

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, IN PARTNERSHIP

WITH PROJECT RED, PURSUANT TO WHICH A PORTION OF THE MONEY SPENT BY CARDMEMBERS IS

DONATED TO THE GLOBAL FUND FOR HIV/AIDS PROGRAMS IN AFRICA;



COBRANDED CONSUMER CREDIT CARDS WITH QANTAS AIRLINES IN AUSTRALIA AND THAI

AIRWAYS INTERNATIONAL IN THAILAND, DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO THE AIRLINES MOST FREQUENT TRAVELERS;



THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SMALL BUSINESS PLATINUM CHARGE CARD IN ITALY, AND A

SMALL BUSINESS GOLD CHARGE CARD IN FRANCE;



NEW PLATINUM CREDIT CARDS IN INDIA AND ARGENTINA; AND



DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH COMMERZBANK TO DISTRIBUTE CONSUMER CARDS IN

GERMANY; WITH ABN-AMRO TO DISTRIBUTE CONSUMER CARDS IN THE NETHERLANDS; AND WITH

MITSUBISHI UFJ FINANCIAL GROUP TO DISTRIBUTE CONSUMER CARDS IN JAPAN.

WE OFFER MANY OF THE SAME PROGRAMS IN OUR INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS AS

WE DO IN OUR U.S. PROPRIETARY ISSUING BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE OFFER

VARIOUS FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS SIMILAR TO OUR SIGN & TRAVEL PROGRAM AND OUR EXTENDED PAYMENT

OPTION TO CARDMEMBERS IN SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

ALSO, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ISSUE CARDS INTERNATIONALLY UNDER DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS

WITH BANKS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS IS AFFINITY CARDS WITH FRATERNAL,

PROFESSIONAL, EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN

PENETRATING THE AFFINITY CARD SEGMENT IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE WE ISSUE CARDS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE

LARGEST PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THAT COUNTRY. IN AUSTRALIA, AFFINITY CARDS ARE A SUBSTANTIAL

PART OF OUR TOTAL REVOLVING PORTFOLIO AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR PROPRIETARY CONSUMER LENDING

ACTIVITIES.

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, REWARDS PROGRAMS ARE A STRONG DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING IN THE

INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER BUSINESS. WE HAVE MORE THAN 1,300 REDEMPTION PARTNERS ACROSS OUR

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WITH AN AVERAGE OF 75 PARTNERS IN EACH COUNTRY; LESS THAN 23% OF THESE

PARTNERS ARE IN THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. CARDMEMBERS CAN REDEEM THEIR POINTS WITH MORE THAN 35

AIRLINES AND OVER 200 HOTELS. OUR REDEMPTION OPTIONS INCLUDE TRAVEL, RETAIL MERCHANDISE,

ENTERTAINMENT, SHOPPING AND RECREATION GIFT CERTIFICATES, EXPERIENCES, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND

CHARITY REWARDS. IN 2006, WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR REWARDS PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL MARKETS,

OFFERING MORE FLEXIBLE CHOICES THAT ENABLE CARDMEMBERS TO REDEEM POINTS MORE QUICKLY.

SIGNIFICANTLY, IN SELECTED MARKETS WE LAUNCHED TRAVELKEY, WHICH ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO BOOK FLIGHTS

AND VACATIONS WITH VIRTUALLY ANY AIRLINE TO ANY DESTINATION WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS, AND ENHANCED THE

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS WEB SITE TO OFFER EASIER ONLINE REDEMPTION. IN AUSTRALIA, WE INTRODUCED

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS CONCIERGE SERVICE TO HELP CARDMEMBERS CREATE CUSTOMIZED REWARDS PACKAGES.

MEMBERSHIP TRAVEL SERVICES INTERNATIONAL PROVIDES PREMIUM TRAVEL AND LIFESTYLE, AS WELL AS

CONCIERGE SERVICES, A BENEFIT THAT EXEMPLIFIES THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PROVIDED TO OUR PLATINUM

CARD AND CENTURION CARD CUSTOMERS, THROUGH 25 EXCLUSIVELY DEDICATED INTERNATIONAL CALL CENTERS IN

25 COUNTRIES. ADDITIONALLY, MEMBERSHIP TRAVEL SERVICES OPERATES 25 PROPRIETARY TRAVEL SERVICE

OFFICES IN MEXICO, ARGENTINA AND ITALY TO PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS WITH TRAVEL AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

ASSISTANCE. ACROSS ALL MARKETS, WE ARE ENHANCING OUR CAPABILITIES TO SELL EXCLUSIVELY NEGOTIATED

BENEFITS AND LUXURY TRAVEL PACKAGES WITH PREFERRED SUPPLIERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESSS

INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE PROGRAM, THE FINE HOTEL & RESORTS PROGRAM AND AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

VACATIONS TO

CREATE EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCES FOR OUR CARDMEMBERS.

COMPETITION  INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARD

AS COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES, CONSUMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES USE CARDS FOR A SMALLER

PERCENTAGE OF THEIR TOTAL PAYMENTS, WITH SOME LARGE EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES JUST BEGINNING TO

TRANSITION TO CARD USAGE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE A SMALL SHARE OF CONSUMER CARD

SPENDING OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONALLY, OUR PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS IS

SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM MULTINATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS CITIBANK, HSBC AND BANCO SANTANDER, AS

WELL AS MANY LOCAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. GLOBALLY, WE VIEW CITIBANK AND HSBC AS OUR

STRONGEST COMPETITORS, AS THEY OFFER CARD PRODUCTS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF MARKETS.

THROUGH THE CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM, COMPANIES CAN MANAGE THEIR TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT AND PURCHASING

EXPENSES AND IMPROVE NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE WITH SUPPLIERS, AMONG OTHER BENEFITS. WE USE OUR DIRECT

RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS TO OFFER CORPORATE CARD CLIENTS SUPERIOR DATA ABOUT COMPANY SPENDING,

AS WELL AS STREAMLINED DISPUTE RESOLUTION. WE ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY

THEIR EVERYDAY SPENDING. CPS IS USED BY CORPORATIONS TO BUY EVERYDAY GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS

OFFICE SUPPLIES AND INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT, IN 24 MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS TYPE

OF SPENDING BY CORPORATIONS IS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS THAN TRADITIONAL TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING AND HELPS TO DIVERSIFY THE SPENDING MIX ON OUR CARDS.

S2S

THE EFFICIENCY OF THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN, REDUCE PROCESSING COSTS AND INCREASE CONTROL AND COMPLIANCE

ALONG ALL STEPS IN THE PURCHASING PROCESS. THE S2S PRODUCT SET

SIGNIFICANTLY

EXPANDS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SUITE OF COMMERCIAL CARD PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND RESPONDS TO CLIENTS

NEEDS AS THEY TRANSFORM THEIR PURCHASING PROCESS, FROM SOURCING AND ORDERING THROUGH INVOICE AND

PAYMENT. TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND ROLL-OUT OF THE S2S

ELECTRONIC INVOICE AND PAYMENT SUITE OF SOLUTIONS, AT THE END OF 2006, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED HARBOR

PAYMENTS, INC., AN ATLANTA-BASED TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WITH AN ESTABLISHED NETWORK OF CORPORATE

CLIENTS AND BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SUPPLIERS.

IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO LARGE AND GLOBAL CORPORATIONS, OUR GCS

BUSINESS MARKETS CORPORATE CARD PROGRAMS TO MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES (DEFINED IN THE UNITED STATES

AS FIRMS WITH ANNUAL REVENUES OF $10 MILLION TO $1 BILLION) WORLDWIDE. GCS IS FOCUSED ON

CONTINUING TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS WITH MIDSIZE COMPANIES, WHICH REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. BUSINESSES OF THIS SIZE OFTEN DO NOT HAVE CORPORATE CARD

PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, ONCE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM, MIDSIZE COMPANIES, WHICH USUALLY DO NOT HAVE

WELL-DEFINED PURCHASING PROGRAMS, WILL TYPICALLY PUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR BUSINESS

SPENDING (BOTH TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT AND NON-T&E, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES) ON THE CARD BECAUSE

THEY CAN GAIN CONTROL, SAVINGS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. IN 2005, OUR GCS BUSINESS INVESTED IN A WIDE

RANGE OF MARKETING PROGRAMS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS, AND ADDED SALES STAFF TO BUILD OUR BUSINESS

WITHIN THE MIDSIZE SEGMENT. IN SUPPORT OF THIS STRATEGY, GCS OFFERS THE SAVINGS AT

WORK

WITH THE INCREASED FOCUS ON COST CONTAINMENT BY FIRMS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN THE CORPORATE MEETING CARD, WHICH HELPS U.S.-BASED AND INTERNATIONAL

COMPANIES CONTROL COMPANY MEETING EXPENSES. THE CORPORATE MEETING CARD IS AVAILABLE IN 19 GLOBAL

MARKETS AND PROVIDES CLIENTS WITH A TOOL TO CAPTURE SUCH SPENDING AND PROVIDES COMPANY MEETING

PLANNERS WITH A TOOL TO SIMPLIFY THE MEETINGS PAYMENT PROCESS AND ACCESS TO DATA TO NEGOTIATE WITH

SUPPLIERS. GCS ALSO OFFERS THE CORPORATE DEFINED EXPENSE PROGRAM. THIS PRODUCT ALLOWS COMPANIES

TO SET A MAXIMUM AMOUNT TO BE CHARGED ON A CARD BEFORE EXPIRATION AND PERMITS THEM TO SEGREGATE

SPENDING DATA FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES ON PROJECTS. IT IS DESIGNED FOR COMPANIES THAT WANT TO

ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE RELOCATIONS OR TRAINING.

DURING

2006, WE ALSO PARTNERED WITH A GROUP OF MAJOR HOTEL COMPANIES IN NORTH AMERICA AND

EUROPE TO OFFER OUR CORPORATE CLIENTS SECURE WEB-BASED ACCESS TO ENHANCED DATA REGARDING THEIR

EMPLOYEES LODGING SPEND. THIS ENHANCED DATA IS AVAILABLE FOR INTEGRATION WITH EXPENSE REPORTING

THIS SUITE OF ONLINE TOOLS IS INTENDED TO ASSIST COMPANIES IN MANAGING EXPENSES MORE EFFICIENTLY

THAN OFFLINE ALTERNATIVES, THEREBY DECREASING BOTH THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

MAINTAINING ACCOUNTS AND ENSURING PROGRAM COMPLIANCE.

COMPETITION  GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS

THE

COMMERCIAL PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH

COMPETITION INCREASINGLY INTENSE AT BOTH THE CARD NETWORK AND CARD

ISSUER LEVELS. AT THE NETWORK LEVEL, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASING

COMPETITION IN THE COMMERCIAL CARD MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION INTO NEW AND EMERGING MARKETS,

EFFORTS TO TRANSITION BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SPEND FROM CASH AND CHECK TO CARDS AND ELECTRONIC

INVOICING AND PAYMENT VEHICLES AND EXPANDING MARKETING AND ADVERTISING BUDGETS FOR COMMERCIAL

SERVICES.

IN ADDITION, BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE INCREASED EFFORTS TO SUPPORT CARD ISSUERS SUCH AS

U.S. BANK, JPMORGAN CHASE, GE CAPITAL FINANCIAL INC. AND CITIBANK (IN THE UNITED STATES AND

GLOBALLY), WHO ARE WILLING TO BUILD AND SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING NECESSARY TO SATISFY

CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS.

CARD ISSUERS HAVE INCREASINGLY ACQUIRED NICHE TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS TO ENHANCE DATA CAPTURE

CAPABILITIES AND REPORTING FUNCTIONALITY. THESE EFFORTS ARE BUILT ON THE SOLID PROGRESS OF THE

BANKCARD ASSOCIATIONS TO OFFER MORE GLOBAL, ROBUST SOLUTIONS. AS SUCH, GLOBAL SERVICING, DATA

SOLUTION TO SUPPORT OUR CLIENTS IN LOCATING AND CARING FOR THEIR TRAVELING EXECUTIVES IN TIMES

OF UNEXPECTED EVENTS AND CRISES.

BUSINESS TRAVEL CONTINUED NUMEROUS REENGINEERING INITIATIVES IN 2006, INCLUDING THE

RATIONALIZATION OF OUR NETWORK, STANDARDIZATION OF PLATFORMS AND PROCESSES AND IMPLEMENTATION OF

NEW TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS TO INCREASE THE FLEXIBILITY OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL, INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY,

REDUCE COSTS AND ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE GLOBALLY. BUSINESS TRAVEL HAS ALSO MOVED

MANY OF ITS BUSINESS PROCESSES AND CUSTOMER SERVICING ONLINE. IN THE UNITED STATES, 43% OF ALL OF

GCS BUSINESS TRAVEL TRANSACTIONS WERE PROCESSED ONLINE, AND WHILE LOWER THAN IN THE UNITED STATES,

ONLINE PENETRATION RATES IN OTHER MARKETS, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, MEXICO AND

AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN RECENT YEARS, RANGING FROM 7% TO 27%.

GLOBAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES (FES) CONSISTS OF RETAIL AND WHOLESALE FOREIGN EXCHANGE

SERVICES AND INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS. IN 2006, WE COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF MOST OF OUR RETAIL

TRAVEL AND FES STANDALONE CITY LOCATIONS, WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF AUSTRALIA, MEXICO AND ITALY. WE

ARE CONCENTRATING THE RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESS IN KEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS, INCLUDING

LONDONS HEATHROW, THE AEROPORTS DE PARIS AND CHANGI AIRPORT IN SINGAPORE. FOR CORPORATE CLIENTS,

OUR INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS ONLINE PAYMENT PRODUCT ALLOWS COMPANIES AND BANKS TO MAKE CROSS-BORDER

PAYMENTS IN MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES AT COMPETITIVE EXCHANGE RATES. WHOLESALE BANKNOTE SERVICES

ARE ALSO PROVIDED TO SELECT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND TRAVEL-RELATED COMPANIES.

COMPETITION  GLOBAL TRAVEL SERVICES

BUSINESS TRAVEL CONTINUES TO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY

FROM NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM DIRECT SALES BY

AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS. COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED

ON PRICE, SERVICE, VALUE CREATION, CONVENIENCE, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER.

IN ADDITION, COMPETITION COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES, AS SOME COMPANIES HAVE BECOME

ACCREDITED AS IN-HOUSE CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS.

IN 2006, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE ANNOUNCED TO THE OWNERSHIP AND NETWORK STRUCTURE OF FOUR OF

THE MAJOR TRADITIONAL TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES  BUSINESS TRAVEL INTERNATIONAL, TQ3, CARLSON

WAGONLIT AND NAVIGANT INTERNATIONAL, INC.  CONSOLIDATING AND REALIGNING THE SHAPE OF THE INDUSTRY.

SIMILARLY, CHANGES TO THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES OF NUMEROUS OTHER TRAVEL INDUSTRY COMPANIES WERE

ANNOUNCED IN 2006, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, QANTAS AIRWAYS LTD., SABRE HOLDINGS CORPORATION,

TRAVELPORT LTD. AND WORLDSPAN LP. IN ADDITION, THE RECENTLY-WITHDRAWN OFFER BY US AIRWAYS TO

ACQUIRE DELTA AIR LINES HAS INCREASED SPECULATION THAT THE U.S. AIRLINE INDUSTRY MAY BE ENTERING A

PERIOD OF CONSOLIDATION. MORE CHANGE IN THE INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW. EACH OF THESE CHANGES

TO THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO TRAVEL

MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A COMPETITIVE IMPACT.

FOR

MANY YEARS, TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES HAVE FACED PRESSURE ON

REVENUES FROM AIRLINES, AS MOST

CARRIERS HAVE STOPPED PAYING BASE COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD. CARRIERS HAVE

ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THEY BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR WEB SITES AND

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER MEANS. THESE TRENDS HAVE REDUCED THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL AGENTS BECAUSE THEY DO

NOT RECEIVE DISTRIBUTION REVENUE FROM DIRECTLY BOOKED TRANSACTIONS.

OVERALL, INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, THE ONGOING TRENDS OF AIRLINE

DIRECT SALES, RISE OF LOW-COST CARRIERS AND ONGOING REDUCTIONS IN OR ELIMINATION OF AIRLINE

COMMISSIONS AND FEES CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON REVENUE FOR TRAVEL AGENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BY CHARGING CUSTOMERS FOR THE SERVICES

WE PROVIDE AND THE VALUE WE CREATE, RESTRUCTURING OUR EXPENSE BASE THROUGH THE RATIONALIZATION OF

OUR CALL CENTER LOCATIONS, TRANSITIONING MANY OF OUR SERVICES ONLINE, AND OUR GLOBAL PRESENCE HAVE

HELPED US TO BALANCE THESE REVENUE PRESSURES.

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (AEB) SERVES AFFLUENT AND HIGH NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS AND FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS THROUGH OVER 75 LOCATIONS IN 47 COUNTRIES AND REGIONS WORLDWIDE. AEBS OPERATIONS ARE

CONDUCTED PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD., AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AEB SERVES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE AND INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. AEB DOES NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES EXCEPT AS MAY

BE INCIDENTAL TO ITS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATING TO

AEB GENERALLY DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN U.S.- AND NON-U.S.-BASED ACTIVITIES.

AEBS TWO PRIMARY BUSINESS LINES ARE GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT (GWM), WHICH INCORPORATES THE

PRIVATE BANK AND FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES, AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GROUP (FIG). THE

PRIVATE BANK FOCUSES ON DELIVERING AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, TRUST AND ESTATE

PLANNING AND BANKING SERVICES, INCLUDING SECURED LENDING AND INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES, TO HIGH NET

PRODUCTS.

AEB CONTINUES TO WORK WITH OTHER PARTS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS TO CROSS-SELL A RANGE OF PAYMENT,

LENDING AND FINANCIAL SERVICE PRODUCTS AND BUILD DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH CONSUMER AND SMALL

BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. AEB MARKETS ITS PRIVATE BANK SERVICES TO A HIGHLY

SELECTIVE GROUP OF CARDMEMBERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AEB OFFERS CREDIT PRODUCTS SUCH AS

INSTALLMENT LOANS AND REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT TO BOTH CARDMEMBERS AND NON-CARDMEMBERS IN GERMANY,

HONG KONG, INDIA AND SINGAPORE. AEB ALSO ISSUES DEPOSIT CERTIFICATES DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS,

EUROS, POUNDS STERLING AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL DEPOSIT

WHOLLY OWNED EDGE ACT SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK INTERNATIONAL (AEBI), IS HEADQUARTERED IN

MIAMI, FLORIDA, AND HAS BRANCHES IN NEW YORK CITY AND MIAMI.

RISKS  BANKING SERVICES

THE GLOBAL NATURE OF AEBS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IS SUCH THAT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT TO

GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS ARE NOT UNUSUAL. AEB CONTINUALLY MONITORS AND ACTIVELY MANAGES ITS CREDIT

CONCENTRATIONS TO REDUCE THE ASSOCIATED RISK. THE PRIVATE BANKS LOANS ARE GENERALLY SECURED BY

LIQUID, MARKETABLE COLLATERAL. FIG CONTROLS ITS EXPOSURES BY LIMITING ITS RELATIONSHIPS TO SELECT

BANKS AND LIMITING ITS EXPOSURES TO SUCH BANKS TO QUANTITATIVE LIMITS (BY OBLIGOR, BY COUNTRY AND

BY EXPOSURE TYPE) THAT ARE PERIODICALLY RE-EVALUATED; SUCH EXPOSURES ALSO TYPICALLY CARRY A

SHORT-TERM TENURE AND ARE TRADE-RELATED, WHICH GENERALLY HAS A LOWER RISK PROFILE. AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, AEB HAD SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

WHICH WERE PRIMARILY REPRESENTED BY DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES, LOANS, FORWARD CONTRACTS,

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT (STANDBY AND COMMERCIAL) AND GUARANTEES. THE

COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WERE PRIMARILY UNRELATED TO AEB, AND PRINCIPALLY

CONSISTED OF CONSUMERS TO WHOM AEB HAS EXTENDED LOANS, BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND

FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OPERATING GEOGRAPHICALLY WITHIN THE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION, EUROPE, NORTH

AMERICA, LATIN AMERICA, THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT AND MIDDLE EAST/AFRICA.

AEBS EARNINGS ARE SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATES BECAUSE THE REPRICING OF ITS LIABILITIES DOES

NOT, GENERALLY, MATCH THE REPRICING OF ITS ASSETS. AEB INVESTS DEPOSITS IN EXCESS OF LOANS AND THE

PROCEEDS OF INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES IN HIGHLY-RATED INVESTMENT SECURITIES. IT MAINTAINS MANDATORY

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AS REQUIRED BY CENTRAL BANKS. AEB MONITORS AND

CONTROLS ITS ASSETS-LIABILITY MISMATCHES BOTH ON A COUNTRY AND GLOBAL LEVEL THROUGH A RIGOROUS

EARNINGS AT RISK PROCESS AND MANAGES THE MISMATCH OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY ADJUSTING THE

REPRICING FREQUENCY OF ITS INVESTMENTS OR BY USING DERIVATIVES.

AEB SELLS FOREIGN EXCHANGE, INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND MAY

DECIDE TO TAKE SHORT-TERM PROPRIETARY TRADING POSITIONS AS A RESULT OF THIS BUSINESS. THE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE, INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY RISK IS MANAGED AT THE BRANCH AND GLOBAL LEVEL THROUGH A

COMPREHENSIVE VALUE AT RISK PROCESS. AEB MANAGES COUNTERPARTY CREDIT EXPOSURE ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE

AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES THROUGH A DYNAMIC MARK-TO-MARKET AND POTENTIAL FUTURE EXPOSURE

PROCESS, IN WHICH THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE EXPOSURE ARE CALCULATED AND MANAGED

AGAINST COUNTERPARTY LOAN EQUIVALENT LIMITS. YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION ON AEBS MANAGEMENT OF

ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK AND USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BECAUSE AEB CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS IN EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES AND IN COUNTRIES THAT

ARE LESS POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY STABLE THAN THE UNITED STATES OR THOSE IN WESTERN EUROPE, ITS

PRIVATE BANKING, FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND FIG ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO GREATER CREDIT

AND COMPLIANCE RISKS THAN ARE FOUND IN MORE WELL-DEVELOPED JURISDICTIONS. AEB CONTINUALLY MONITORS

ITS EXPOSURES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, AND REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS CLIENT BASE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL

LEGAL RISKS AS A RESULT OF CLIENTS USE OF AEBS BANKING SERVICES.

COMPETITION  BANKING SERVICES

THE BANKING SERVICES OF AEB ARE SUBJECT TO VIGOROUS COMPETITION EVERYWHERE AEB OPERATES.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL BANKS WHOSE ASSETS OFTEN EXCEED THOSE OF AEB, OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.

REGULATION  BANKING SERVICES

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANKING CORP. (AEBC) IS A NEW YORK INVESTMENT COMPANY ORGANIZED UNDER

ARTICLE XII OF THE NEW YORK BANKING LAW AND IS A WHOLLY OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN

EXPRESS. AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. (AEBL) IS A WHOLLY OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF AEBC. AEBC,

AEBL AND AEBLS GLOBAL NETWORK OF OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO CONTINUOUS SUPERVISION

AND EXAMINATION BY THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT (NYSBD) PURSUANT TO THE NEW YORK BANKING

LAW. AEBC DOES NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN BANKING ACTIVITIES. AEBLS BRANCHES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES

AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE LICENSED AND REGULATED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS AND ARE

SUBJECT TO THE SAME LOCAL REQUIREMENTS AS OTHER COMPETITORS THAT HAVE THE SAME LICENSE.

SINCE AEBC AND AEBL DO NOT DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, EXCEPT AS MAY BE INCIDENTAL TO

THEIR ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, OUR AFFILIATION WITH AEBC AND AEBL DOES NOT REQUIRE US

TO REGISTER AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER REGULATION Y PROMULGATED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF

THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD). AEBC AND AEBL ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE SYSTEM, ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION BY THE FDIC, AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OF THE

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE COMPETITIVE EQUALITY BANKING ACT OF 1987

OTHER THAN ANTI-TYING RULES

WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES. AEBC

AND AEBL ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT.

THE NYSBD REQUIRES AEBC, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, TO MONITOR ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

MAINTAIN RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH MINIMUM THRESHOLDS ESTABLISHED BY THE

NYSBD. AT YEAR-END 2006, AEB HAD TIER ONE, TOTAL AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL (AS THOSE TERMS ARE DEFINED

UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES) THAT EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM

STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE NYSBD. ADDITIONALLY, AEB IS NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY ON A CONSOLIDATED

BASIS WITH THE ADVANCED INTERNAL RATINGS BASED APPROACH INCORPORATED IN THE BASEL II CAPITAL ACCORD

FRAMEWORK PUBLISHED IN JUNE, 2004. AEB MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

THE BASEL II CAPITAL ACCORD IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE ITS BRANCH AND SUBSIDIARY NETWORK IS LOCATED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN RECENT YEARS, U.S. AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, TOGETHER WITH INTERNATIONAL

ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE RAISED INCREASING CONCERNS OVER THE ABILITY OF CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND

CORRUPT PERSONS TO USE GLOBAL FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES TO FACILITATE MONEY LAUNDERING. IN THE

UNITED STATES, THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO THE PATRIOT ACT

THAT SPECIFICALLY IMPACT CERTAIN MONEY LAUNDERING PREVENTION ACTIVITIES OF ENTITIES INVOLVED, AS

AEBL IS, IN CORRESPONDENT AND PRIVATE BANKING ACTIVITIES. COMPLIANCE EFFORTS TO COMBAT MONEY

LAUNDERING REMAIN A HIGH PRIORITY FOR AEBL, AND IT HAS INCREASED ITS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS EVOLVING

REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS.

BUSINESS MODEL. DURING 2006, WE BROADENED OUR FOCUS TO INCLUDE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THE INTERNET

TO DRIVE REVENUE AND BUILD OUR BRAND, WHILE CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON MIGRATING TRANSACTION VOLUMES AT

LOWER COSTS. WE NOW HAVE MORE ONLINE INTERACTIONS WITH U.S. CUSTOMERS THAN WE DO BY TELEPHONE OR

IN PERSON.

AT YEAR-END, CUSTOMERS HAD ENROLLED APPROXIMATELY 21 MILLION CARDS GLOBALLY IN OUR MANAGE

YOUR CARD ACCOUNT SERVICE. THIS SERVICE ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO REVIEW AND PAY THEIR AMERICAN

EXPRESS BILLS ELECTRONICALLY, VIEW AND SERVICE THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ACCOUNTS AND

CONDUCT VARIOUS OTHER FUNCTIONS QUICKLY AND SECURELY ONLINE. WE NOW HAVE AN ONLINE PRESENCE IN 62

MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING GNS MARKETS.

WE CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST

LEVEL OF DATA INTEGRITY, SECURITY AND PRIVACY. ALSO, IN 2006, WE AND SEVERAL OTHER CARD NETWORKS

FORMED PCI SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL, LLC, AN INDEPENDENT STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION THAT WILL

MANAGE THE EVOLUTION OF THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY (PCI) DATA SECURITY STANDARD. (FOR A DISCUSSION

OF THIS ORGANIZATION, SEE THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES SECTION ABOVE.)

IN 2002, WE OUTSOURCED MOST OF OUR TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS WORK TO IBM. THIS ARRANGEMENT, WHICH

HAS A SEVEN-YEAR TERM WITH OPTIONS TO EXTEND, ENABLES US TO BENEFIT FROM IBMS EXPERTISE WHILE

LOWERING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS. IBM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING MOST OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY

TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING MAINFRAME, MIDRANGE AND DESKTOP SYSTEMS; WEB HOSTING;

DATABASE ADMINISTRATION; HELP DESK SERVICES AND DATA CENTER OPERATIONS. OUR INTERNAL IT

ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO RETAIN THE COMPANYS TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCIES, INCLUDING INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY, INFORMATION SECURITY, MANAGING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH TECHNOLOGIES

PARTNERS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING APPLICATIONS AND DATABASES AND MANAGING THE TECHNOLOGY

PORTFOLIOS OF OUR BUSINESSES.

REGULATION  GENERAL

MOST ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS REGULATION BY U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE

REGULATORY AGENCIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND BY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR REGULATORY

BODIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES. CERTAIN OF OUR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT

AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND RELATED

REGULATIONS AND RULES OF THE SEC AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR

CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT) COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS A GLOBAL

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TO THE EXTENT THAT DIFFERENT REGULATORY SYSTEMS IMPOSE OVERLAPPING OR

INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE FACE COMPLEXITY AND ADDITIONAL COSTS

IN OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP AND MAKE AVAILABLE RELEVANT, PERSONALIZED

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THEIR

INFORMATION, AND WE GIVE THEM NOTICE REGARDING THE MEASURES WE TAKE TO SAFEGUARD THIS INFORMATION.

REGULATORY ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE,

SPURRED BY ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT THE RAPID AND WIDESPREAD

DISSEMINATION AND USE OF INFORMATION. AS NOTED ABOVE, AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO ENHANCE PAYMENT

ACCOUNT DATA SECURITY, IN 2006, WE AND DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, JCB, MASTERCARD WORLDWIDE AND

VISA INTERNATIONAL FORMED THE PCI SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL, AN OPEN GLOBAL FORUM FOR THE ONGOING

DEVELOPMENT, ENHANCEMENT, STORAGE, DISSEMINATION AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY STANDARDS FOR ACCOUNT DATA PROTECTION THROUGHOUT THE TRANSACTION

PROCESS.

THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2001. GLBA PROVIDES FOR

DISCLOSURE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIVACY POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE

RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO

UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS). THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS

THAT AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS, AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE ADOPTED SUCH

LEGISLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2003 CALIFORNIA ENACTED THAT STATES FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY

ACT. WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH

APPLICABLE LAW AND OUR INTERNAL DATA PROTECTION POLICIES, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE

POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT, WHILE SEEKING TO COLLECT AND USE DATA PROPERLY TO ACHIEVE OUR

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.

THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT OF 1970 REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY

CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER

COMPANIES. FCRA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED BY THE ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2003 OF THE FAIR AND

ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT (THE FACT ACT). THE FACT ACT REQUIRES ANY COMPANY THAT RECEIVES

INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN AFFILIATE TO PERMIT THE CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM HAVING

THAT INFORMATION USED TO MARKET THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. THE FACT ACT FURTHER

AMENDS THE FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT OR DECREASE IDENTITY THEFT AND

TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CONSUMER CREDIT INFORMATION. NEW DUTIES ARE IMPOSED ON BOTH CONSUMER

REPORTING AGENCIES AND ON BUSINESSES THAT FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CONSUMER CREDIT

REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FURNISHER OF INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO PREVENT

THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE RESULT OF IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO, IF A

CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, THE

FURNISHER OF THAT INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A TIMELY

FASHION. THE FACT ACT ALSO REQUIRES GRANTORS OF CREDIT THAT USE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION

IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO OFFER A BORROWER CREDIT ON TERMS THAT ARE MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE

THAN THE TERMS OFFERED TO MOST OF THE LENDERS OTHER CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE BORROWER THAT THE

TERMS ARE BASED ON A CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. IN SUCH A CASE THE BORROWER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A

FREE COPY OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. GRANTORS OF CREDIT USING PRE-SCREENED

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN CREDIT SOLICITATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO INCLUDE AN ENHANCED

NOTICE TO CONSUMERS THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT FROM RECEIVING FURTHER PRE-SCREENED OFFERS

OF CREDIT. THE ENACTMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FACT ACT HAS NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

OUR BUSINESS OR PRACTICES.

THE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR 2007 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT INCLUDES A PROVISION (OFTEN REFERRED TO

AS THE TALENT AMENDMENT) AIMED AT PREVENTING ABUSES OF PAYDAY LENDING PROGRAMS MARKETED TO

MEMBERS OF THE U.S. MILITARY SERVICES. THIS PROVISION IS BROADLY WORDED AND COULD BE INTERPRETED

TO IMPOSE A NUMBER OF NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ON LENDING PRODUCTS THAT MAY BE MARKETED TO

MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS PRIMARY AUTHORITY FOR MAKING THE RULES

UNDER WHICH THIS PROVISION WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. THE COMPANY IS WORKING WITH INDUSTRY GROUPS TO

URGE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO CRAFT THESE RULES IN A MANNER THAT WILL CARRY OUT THE PROVISIONS

PURPOSE OF CURBING ABUSES IN PAYDAY LENDING WITHOUT IMPOSING UNDUE REGULATION ON LENDING PRODUCTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE PATRIOT ACT WAS ENACTED IN OCTOBER 2001 IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER

11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS. THE PATRIOT ACT SUBSTANTIALLY

BROADENED EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND THE EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE

UNITED STATES. THE PATRIOT ACT CONTAINS A WIDE VARIETY OF PROVISIONS

AIMED AT FIGHTING TERRORISM AND MONEY LAUNDERING,

INCLUDING PROVISIONS AIMED AT IMPEDING TERRORISTS ABILITY TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN SUPPORT

OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PATRIOT ACT REQUIRES FEDERAL REGULATORS, LED BY

THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, TO REGULATE OR TAKE OTHER STEPS TO REQUIRE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO

ESTABLISH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING EXPANDED REPORTING

AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS. WHILE AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS LONG

MAINTAINED ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS IN OUR BUSINESSES, THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS

ISSUED REGULATIONS UNDER THE PATRIOT ACT APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED

WITHIN AEB, TRS AND THEIR AFFILIATES, PRESCRIBING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SUCH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

PROGRAMS, AND WE HAVE ENHANCED EXISTING PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED NEW ONES IN RESPONSE

TO THESE NEW REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN APRIL 2002, THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY ISSUED

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OPERATORS OF CREDIT CARD NETWORKS (SUCH AS VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS

CLUB, DISCOVER AND AMERICAN EXPRESS) THAT WOULD REQUIRE CREDIT CARD NETWORKS TO HAVE RISK-BASED

PROGRAMS TO SCREEN INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE CARDS OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THEIR

NETWORKS. AS A RESULT, WE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM FOR OUR GNS BUSINESS. WE HAVE ALSO

DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM APPLICABLE TO MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES,

AND WE HAVE ENHANCED OUR KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER AND ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAMS IN OTHERS. WE

INTEND TO TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED. IN ADDITION, WE

WILL TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING INITIATIVES ADOPTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF REGULATED

BUSINESSES. WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EU LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS IN THE OTHER MARKETS IN WHICH WE

OPERATE, TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS,

INCLUDING EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES APPLICABLE TO CREDIT INSTITUTIONS, INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS, TRAVELERS

CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

AND CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A

DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SEE NOTE

19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON PAGES

106-109 OF OUR 2006 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND WHICH

IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.) OUR REVENUES CAN BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT BY

THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH

COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN OTHER THAN THEIR LOCAL

CURRENCY, AND FOR THE REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES).

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS

CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL

ISSUER OF THE CARD IN

CONNECTION WITH SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY. THE MAJORITY OF AEBS REVENUES ARE DERIVED

FROM BUSINESS CONDUCTED IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SOME OF THE RISKS ATTENDANT TO

THOSE OPERATIONS INCLUDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL

ENVIRONMENTS IN EACH SUCH COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT, BECAUSE OF

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE

U.S. DOLLAR MAY BE REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESS THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY

ARE CURRENTLY RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH

THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE PURCHASE BY CARDMEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN

THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A TRAVELERS CHEQUE DENOMINATED

IN A SECOND CURRENCY; FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS HELD BY AEB AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ITS CLIENT-RELATED

FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING OPERATIONS; AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS.

THESE RISKS, UNLESS PROPERLY MONITORED AND MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

THIS SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU

SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN

THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THAT

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY.

HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW.

ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE

IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR THE

CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

WE FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE WHICH MAY IMPACT THE PRICES WE CHARGE

MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON HIGH REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO

DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH

REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND

SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE

REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MARKET PRESSURE TO REDUCE MERCHANT DISCOUNT

RATES AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. THIS PRESSURE ARISES, IN PART, DUE TO THE

REGULATORY PRESSURE ON OUR COMPETITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS BEEN INCREASING. IF WE

CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE WE CHARGE MERCHANTS OR ARE

UNABLE TO SUSTAIN PREMIUM MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES ON OUR CARDS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING OVERALL VOLUME

GROWTH OR AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INCREASE CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT

SERVICES PRODUCTS OR MANAGE THE COSTS OF OUR CARDMEMBER BENEFITS INTENDED TO STIMULATE SUCH USE.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING

CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT

AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING

BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. IT ALSO DEPENDS

ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER ATTRITION, INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE,

AND CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON OUR NETWORK, BOTH IN

THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW

CARDMEMBERS IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE

GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES. IF WE ARE

NOT SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING OR IN MANAGING THE COSTS OF OUR

CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW

WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR

LEVEL OF SERVICE, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY

REGARDING THESE MATTERS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND

CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS AND MAINTAIN

EXISTING ONES. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION,

NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY.

ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE

PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO

REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES STORE CARDMEMBER ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE

AND CREDIT CARDS. CRIMINALS ARE USING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES

OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO ENGAGE

IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT. AS OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION BECOME A

MORE ACCEPTABLE WAY OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES

INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS. IF DATA BREACHES OR FRAUD LEVELS INVOLVING

OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE, IT COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD

REISSUANCE) AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND

ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE SUCCESSFUL AND WE MAY NOT

REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE INTENDED.

WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS

TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS

(INCLUDING THE REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS),

ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EXPENSE TO

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT,

STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION,

OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN

FUNCTIONS TO LOWER COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET

TO SAVE COSTS AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF

WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE

ON THESE EFFORTS, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE INTENDED.

FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE

INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK

OF DOWNTURNS IN THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE

OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED

WITH COSTCO TO OFFER COBRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY INDUSTRIES, MOST NOTABLY THE AIRLINE

INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS AND IN RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES,

RESTRUCTURINGS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISK UNDER OUR

AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA AIR LINES, WHICH WERE RESTRUCTURED IN CONNECTION WITH DELTAS FILING FOR

PROTECTION UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE

AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  AIRLINE

INDUSTRY MATTERS ON PAGE 60 OF OUR 2006

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, UNDER SOME TYPES OF THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS,

UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN

COBRAND PARTNERS, MERCHANTS, VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE

TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE

A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO

RISK IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND

OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY OR ANY OTHER INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, INCLUDING ANY POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PARTICULAR

CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) THAT COULD RESULT FROM THE ACTUAL OR

PERCEIVED WEAKNESS OF KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS IN SUCH INDUSTRIES.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS, MERCHANT

BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS AND THE RATE OF BANKRUPTCIES, WHICH CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON

CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR

CARD PRODUCTS. CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE ARE

EXPOSED TO BOTH CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, PRINCIPALLY FROM CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES, AND OUR OTHER

CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM MERCHANTS AND GNS PARTNERS. WHILE

CONSUMER CREDIT RISK IS MORE CLOSELY LINKED TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS RATHER THAN

BORROWER-SPECIFIC EVENTS LIKE INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK, BOTH EXPOSE US TO A RISK OF LOSS. THIRD

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL

FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK.

RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND

MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN

OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR

SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS

AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION THAT WE USE IN

MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS

THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS

THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET

VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD BUSINESS. CHANGES IN THE

INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN

ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET FINANCE CHARGE REVENUE, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL.

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND,

IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE, INCLUDING THE VALUATION OF THE

INTEREST-ONLY STRIP (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE I/O STRIP) ARISING FROM OUR SECURITIZATION OF

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER

OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT ACHIEVING OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO FAILED PROCESSES,

PEOPLE OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OR FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS.

OPERATIONAL RISKS INCLUDE THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE EXPENSE PROVISION FOR

THE COST OF OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS THE RISK THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE A

DOWNTURN IN OUR BUSINESSES AND/OR NEGATIVE CHANGES IN OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS,

WHICH COULD RESULT IN CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTS, DECREASED LIQUIDITY AND HIGHER BORROWING

COSTS.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK

MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 49-53 OF OUR 2006 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES.

MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES TO RECORD PROPERLY AND VERIFY A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS, AND THESE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADVERSE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD DECREASE REVENUE WE RECEIVE

FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

DURING 2006, OVER 30% OF OUR REVENUE WAS GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE

WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF

THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND

LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL

REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO

U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES

WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING, INCLUDING SECURITIZATIONS, MAY BE LIMITED.

IN GENERAL, THE AMOUNT, TYPE AND COST OF OUR FUNDING, INCLUDING FINANCING FROM OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS, DIRECTLY IMPACTS OUR EXPENSE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS AND

GROWING OUR ASSETS AND THEREFORE, CAN POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS COULD MAKE SUCH FINANCING MORE DIFFICULT, MORE EXPENSIVE OR UNAVAILABLE ON

ANY TERMS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY (WHERE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS MAY BE ON TERMS MORE OR

LESS FAVORABLE THAN IN THE UNITED STATES), INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

LOSSES, CHANGES WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION, SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION,

CHANGES IN THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, DISRUPTIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, SPECIFIC

EVENTS THAT ADVERSELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COUNTER-PARTY AVAILABILITY, CHANGES

AFFECTING OUR ASSETS, OUR CORPORATE AND REGULATORY STRUCTURE, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, RATINGS

AGENCIES ACTIONS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE LEGAL, REGULATORY, ACCOUNTING AND TAX

ENVIRONMENTS GOVERNING OUR FUNDING TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS IS

STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE GENERAL STATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND WORLD ECONOMIES, AND MAY BECOME

INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT DUE TO ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS. ALSO, WE COMPETE FOR FUNDING WITH OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE PUBLICLY TRADED. COMPETITION FROM THESE INSTITUTIONS MAY

INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

IN

ADDITION, WE PERIODICALLY SECURITIZE CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS ARISING FROM OUR CARD

BUSINESS. SECURITIZATION INVOLVES THE LEGAL SALE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES

AND LOAN BALANCES TO A TRUST, WHICH IN TURN ISSUES SECURITIES TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS

COLLATERALIZED BY THE TRANSFERRED RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AND OUR RECEIPT OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE

ISSUANCE OF SUCH SECURITIES. ALTHOUGH THE MARKETS FOR SECURITIZED CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD

RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS LARGE AND WELL-ESTABLISHED, IF THESE MARKETS EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES, WE

MAY BE UNABLE TO SECURITIZE OUR RECEIVABLES OR TO DO SO AT FAVORABLE PRICING LEVELS. IF WE WERE

UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO SECURITIZE OUR LOAN RECEIVABLES AT DESIRED LEVELS, WE WOULD USE ALTERNATIVE

FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS. IF WE WERE UNABLE TO FIND COST-EFFECTIVE AND STABLE

ALTERNATIVES, IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO CERTAIN RISKS.

THESE RISKS WOULD INCLUDE AN INCREASE IN OUR COST OF FUNDS, AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOSSES AND THE PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES AS MORE LOANS WOULD REMAIN ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AND LOWER LOAN GROWTH.

IN ADDITION, THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS MAY CAUSE THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS TO

AMORTIZE EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED, WHICH WOULD ACCELERATE THE NEED FOR AN ALTERNATE SOURCE OF

FUNDING.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  FUNDING

STRATEGY ON PAGES 43-48 IN THE 2006 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF,

TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE

IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS,

INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS,

TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND

POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW

SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE

NEW SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY

USE IN OUR CARDS AND NETWORKS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES

THAT WE DEVELOP MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS OR BY RESISTANCE FROM

CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS TO SUCH CHANGES IN ADDITION TO PATENT RIGHTS HELD BY COMPETITORS OR

OTHERS. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP OR ADAPT TO

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION

WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDES, IN ADDITION TO CREDIT CARD NETWORKS,

EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR

MAY DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, MAY OFFER A WIDER

RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING

STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION OR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT

CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITORS MAY

BE MORE EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE ARE. AS A

RESULT, OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY MAY DECLINE.

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL

REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY AND LEAD TO

DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES THROUGH OUR NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN THE MANY

COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS A PROVIDER OF

SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE

PATRIOT ACT, WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENED EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND THE

EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THE PATRIOT ACT REQUIRES US TO CREATE AND

IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING

EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS

TO PERFORM DUE DILIGENCE ON THE THIRD PARTY INSTITUTIONS THAT ISSUE CARDS AND/OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS

ON OUR NETWORK. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR

RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED AND WHERE WE PROVIDE PRIVATE AND

CORRESPONDENT BANKING SERVICES, AND THE TYPES OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT

OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

THE U.S. CONGRESS IS ALSO PRESENTLY CONSIDERING LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES IN THE AREAS OF

INTERNET GAMBLING, INTERNET PRESCRIPTION DRUG PURCHASES AND COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT,

AMONG OTHERS, THAT COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY

,

FOR EXAMPLE, IMPOSING

REQUIREMENTS AIMED AT PREVENTING THE USE OF PAYMENT CARDS TO UNLAWFULLY PURCHASE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

OVER THE INTERNET. MANY STATES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF SIMILAR LEGISLATION. FEDERAL AND

STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO CONTACTED PAYMENT COMPANIES CONCERNING THESE ISSUES.

IF IMPLEMENTED, THESE INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO MONITOR, FILTER, RESTRICT, OR OTHERWISE OVERSEE

VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, THEREBY INCREASING OUR COSTS OR

DECREASING OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS

COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY, AND MARKETING

THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS.

THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES,

NEW REGULATIONS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR

CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED VALUE CARDS, WHICH

COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND VARIOUS FEDERAL

RESERVE BANKS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS ON INTERCHANGE AND HAVE HELD SEVERAL CONFERENCES

FOCUSED ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE RATES. WHILE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN

MONITORING THIS ISSUE, IT HAS NOT INDICATED THE NEED TO REGULATE INTERCHANGE RATES IN THE UNITED

STATES. IN CONGRESS, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HEARINGS ON VISA AND MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE OVER THE

LAST YEAR. DURING 2006, THERE WERE ALSO A NUMBER OF BILLS PROPOSED IN INDIVIDUAL STATE

LEGISLATURES SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE OR TO PROHIBIT CARD COMPANIES FROM

CHARGING MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE STATE TAX PORTION OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. NONE OF THOSE BILLS

WERE ENACTED. IT IS EXPECTED THAT CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS AND SIMILAR PROPOSED STATE LEGISLATION

WILL CONTINUE DURING 2007.

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATORS AND CONGRESS HAVE ALSO INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF OUR INDUSTRYS FEES TO ITS

CUSTOMERS. ANY LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRICE OUR SERVICES FREELY

COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TRANSACTION VOLUME AND REVENUES.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON OUR COMPANY, SUCH AS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED

ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR

NETWORKS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

EXISTING AND PROPOSED REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF CONSUMER PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY

COULD DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ISSUED AND COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY IN THE

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THESE REGULATIONS.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIONS INFORMATION

SAFEGUARDS RULE UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. THE RULE REQUIRES THAT EACH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN, COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM

CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE

NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF ANY CUSTOMER

INFORMATION AT ISSUE. THE HEIGHTENED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FOCUS ON DATA SECURITY, INCLUDING

REQUIRING CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A DATA BREACH, CONTINUES. IN THE UNITED STATES,

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS PENDING IN CONGRESS AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS

TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. CONGRESS WILL LIKELY CONSIDER DATA SECURITY/DATA BREACH LEGISLATION IN

2007 THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY 34 STATES, PUERTO RICO AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE ENACTED

SECURITY BREACH LEGISLATION, REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A

SECURITY BREACH, AND SEVERAL OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING SIMILAR LEGISLATION. IN 1995, THE

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS

WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA (COMMONLY

REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN INDIVIDUALS

PERSONAL DATA TO TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA.

THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS REGULATING DATA PROTECTION

IN EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES. ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS IN THESE AREAS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR

COSTS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT TRENDS IN CONSUMER

SPENDING AND IN TRAVEL.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS HEAVILY UPON THE OVERALL LEVEL OF SPENDING USING OUR CREDIT AND CHARGE

CARDS, AND WE ARE NOT INSULATED FROM THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC CYCLES. A SUSTAINED DETERIORATION IN

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES OR EUROPE, OR INCREASES IN INTEREST

RATES IN KEY COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BY

REDUCING THE NUMBER OR AVERAGE PURCHASE AMOUNT OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS AND RESULT IN INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND CREDIT LOSSES.

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR

COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON

CONVERTIBILITY OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND

PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT

ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED

AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND

INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR

REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS

MAY DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL

MIGHT INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS.

IF OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE DISRUPTED OR WE ARE UNABLE TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS

EFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL, OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY WOULD BE MATERIALLY REDUCED.

OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE

INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER LOSS, DISRUPTIONS IN LONG DISTANCE OR

LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACCESS, FRAUD, TERRORISM OR ACCIDENT. A NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER PROBLEM

AT OUR FACILITIES COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE

PROVIDERS FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE

PROVIDER FAILS TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF

NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION, TERRORISM OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD

INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF OUR BRANDS RELIABILITY AND MATERIALLY

REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY.

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO

THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS MANY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE

INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS

ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR THIRD-PARTY VENDORS WILL PERFORM

THEIR OBLIGATIONS AS EXPECTED.

RESOLUTION OF OUR UNRESOLVED SEC STAFF COMMENT MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE PRESENTATION OF

OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OUR BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF THREE REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS, U.S. CARD SERVICES,

INTERNATIONAL CARD & GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES AND GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES. IN

CONNECTION WITH A REVIEW OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005,

THE SEC REQUESTED CERTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING THE AGGREGATION OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS INTO THE

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IDENTIFIED ABOVE. THE COMPANY AND THE SEC ARE

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTINUING TO DISCUSS THE COMPANYS SEGMENT REPORTING. IF, AS A RESULT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS,

IT IS CONCLUDED THAT A DIFFERENT REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENT PRESENTATION (INCLUDING THE

DISAGGREGATION OF CERTAIN OPERATING SEGMENTS) IS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD REPORT OUR SEGMENTS

DIFFERENTLY IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SEC (ALTHOUGH CONSOLIDATED RESULTS WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED). THE

SEC MAY ALSO REQUIRE THAT WE RESTATE SEGMENT INFORMATION THAT APPEARS IN THE NOTES TO OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND FILE AN AMENDMENT

TO THIS FORM 10-K TO REFLECT ANY SUCH CHANGES TO THE REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENT PRESENTATION.

SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT THAT MAY CONSTITUTE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY ALSO BE MADE IN OUR OTHER REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC, IN OUR PRESS

RELEASES AND IN OTHER DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE, THROUGH OUR MANAGEMENT, MAY

MAKE ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED ABOVE, WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM SUCH STATEMENTS. THE WORDS BELIEVE, EXPECT, ANTICIPATE, OPTIMISTIC,

INTEND, PLAN, AIM, WILL, MAY, SHOULD, COULD, WOULD, LIKELY AND SIMILAR

EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. WE CAUTION YOU THAT THE RISK

FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE. THERE MAY ALSO BE OTHER RISKS THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO

PREDICT AT THIS TIME THAT MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE IN

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. READERS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THEY ARE MADE. WE UNDERTAKE

NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE PUBLICLY OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

WE RECEIVED COMMENTS FROM THE SEC IN A LETTER, DATED JUNE 30, 2006, WITH RESPECT TO OUR FORM

10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005. ALL COMMENTS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

HOW WE AGGREGATE SEGMENT DATA IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED

INFORMATION. AS DISCUSSED IN RISK FACTORS ABOVE, THE COMPANY AND THE SEC ARE CONTINUING TO

DISCUSS THE COMPANYS SEGMENT REPORTING.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE IN A 51-STORY, 2.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT BUILDING LOCATED IN

LOWER MANHATTAN. THIS BUILDING, WHICH IS ON LAND LEASED FROM THE BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY FOR A

TERM EXPIRING IN 2069, IS ONE OF FOUR OFFICE BUILDINGS IN A COMPLEX KNOWN AS THE WORLD FINANCIAL

CENTER. WE HAVE A 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. BROOKFIELD FINANCIAL PROPERTIES OWNS

THE REMAINING 51% INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. WE ALSO LEASE SPACE IN THE BUILDING FROM BROOKFIELD.

OTHER OWNED OR LEASED PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS INCLUDE: THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE CENTERS IN

FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA; PHOENIX, ARIZONA; GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA; AND SALT LAKE CITY,

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UTAH; THE AMERICAN EXPRESS DATA CENTERS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA AND IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA; THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCE CENTER IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA; AND THE AMEX CANADA INC. HEADQUARTERS IN

MARKHAM, ONTARIO, CANADA; AND SERVICE CENTERS LOCATED IN MEXICO CITY, MEXICO; SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA;

GURGAON, INDIA AND BRIGHTON, UNITED KINGDOM.

IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE ENGAGED IN SEVERAL SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE

SOLD VARIOUS OWNED PROPERTIES TO THIRD PARTIES AND LEASED BACK THE PROPERTIES UNDER LONG-TERM NET

LEASES WHEREBY EACH AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITY THAT LEASES BACK THE PROPERTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL

COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, UTILITIES, OPERATING

EXPENSES AND INSURANCE COSTS) IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL RENT. THE SALE LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS HAVE NOT

MATERIALLY IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY YEAR. GAINS RESULTING FROM COMPLETED SALE AND

LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE INITIAL TEN-YEAR LEASE PERIODS. WE CONTINUE TO

CONSIDER WHETHER SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER PROPERTIES THAT WE CURRENTLY

OWN.

IN FEBRUARY 2000, WE ENTERED INTO A TEN-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH CBRE REAL ESTATE SERVICES, INC.,

FORMERLY KNOWN AS TRAMMELL CROW CORPORATE SERVICES, INC., FOR FACILITIES, PROJECT AND TRANSACTION

MANAGEMENT AND OTHER RELATED SERVICES. THE AGREEMENT COVERS NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA AND PARTS OF

EUROPE AND ASIA.

GENERALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES LEASE THE PREMISES WE OCCUPY IN OTHER LOCATIONS. WE

BELIEVE THAT THE FACILITIES WE OWN OR OCCUPY SUIT OUR NEEDS AND ARE WELL MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND ARBITRATION

PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF

THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO EACH OF

THESE ACTIONS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY. IN THE COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO  AND GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS, INFORMATION

GATHERING REQUESTS, SUBPOENAS, INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT A

PARTY TO, NOR ARE ANY OF ITS PROPERTIES THE SUBJECT OF, ANY PENDING

LEGAL, ARBITRATION, REGULATORY, TAX OR INVESTIGATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY

PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD AS THE PROCEEDINGS ARE RESOLVED. CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING

THE COMPANY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

CORPORATE MATTERS

BEGINNING IN MID-JULY 2002, 12 PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. IN OCTOBER 2002, THESE CASES WERE

CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECURITIES LITIGATION

. THESE

LAWSUITS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND THE COMMON LAW IN CONNECTION WITH

ALLEGED MISSTATEMENTS REGARDING CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN HIGH-YIELD BONDS AND WRITE-DOWNS IN THE

2000-2001 TIMEFRAME. THE PURPORTED CLASS COVERS THE PERIOD FROM JULY 18, 1999 TO JULY 17,

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2001. THE ACTIONS SEEK UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AS WELL AS DISGORGEMENT, PUNITIVE

DAMAGES, ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS, AND INTEREST. ON MARCH 31, 2004, THE COURT GRANTED THE

COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE LAWSUIT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE DISMISSAL TO THE UNITED STATES

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. IN AUGUST 2006, THE COURT OF APPEALS, WITHOUT EXPRESSING

ANY VIEWS WHATSOEVER ON THE MERITS OF THE CASES, VACATED THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT AND REMANDED

ALL CLAIMS TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. MORE PARTICULARLY, THE COURT OF APPEALS

REVERSED THE DISTRICT COURTS RULING THAT TWO OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS IN AN AMENDED COMPLAINT DID

NOT RELATE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT AND WERE THUS TIME-BARRED UNDER THE STATUTE OF

LIMITATIONS PERIOD. AS A RESULT, THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED THAT IT WAS PRUDENT TO REMAND ALL

CLAIMS BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT SO THAT PLAINTIFFS COULD FILE A NEW AMENDED COMPLAINT.

PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR AMENDED COMPLAINT ON JANUARY 8, 2007. THE COMPANY WROTE TO THE COURT ON

FEBRUARY 5, 2007, TELLING THE COURT THAT IT INTENDED TO FILE A MOTION TO STRIKE THE AMENDED

COMPLAINT. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE ACTION.

IN DECEMBER 2003, AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. WAS NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION PURPORTEDLY FILED ON BEHALF OF INFOSPACE INC. THE

ACTION, CAPTIONED

DREILING V. AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC.

, WAS

FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE

COMPANY VIOLATED THE SHORT SWING LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF SECTION 16(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE

ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, IN CONNECTION WITH ITS SALE OF INFOSPACE COMMON STOCK. THE PLAINTIFF

SEEKS DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS FROM THE SALE OF THE INFOSPACE SHARES, AS WELL AS FEES AND EXPENSES.

IN JUNE 2004, THE COURT GRANTED AMERICAN EXPRESS MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT AMERICAN

EXPRESS EVER HAVING ANSWERED THE COMPLAINT. IN AUGUST 2006, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT REINSTATED THE ACTION BECAUSE OF CERTAIN UNRESOLVED FACTUAL DISPUTES. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THIS ACTION AND INTENDS TO DEFEND IT

VIGOROUSLY.

IN JANUARY 2006, A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED

PAULA KRITZMAN, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON

BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED V. AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT PLAN ET AL.

WAS FILED IN

THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE PLAINTIFF ALLEGES THAT WHEN THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT PLAN (THE AXP PLAN) WAS AMENDED EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1995, TO CONVERT

FROM A FINAL AVERAGE PAY FORMULA TO A CASH BALANCE FORMULA FOR THE CALCULATION OF BENEFITS, THE

TERMS OF THE AMENDED AXP PLAN VIOLATED THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT, AS AMENDED

(ERISA), IN AT LEAST THE FOLLOWING WAYS: (I) THE AXP PLAN VIOLATED ERISAS PROHIBITION ON

REDUCING RATES OF BENEFIT ACCRUAL DUE TO THE INCREASING AGE OF A PLAN PARTICIPANT; (II) THE AXP

PLAN VIOLATED ERISAS PROHIBITION ON FORFEITURE OF ACCRUED BENEFITS; AND (III) THE AXP PLAN

VIOLATED ERISAS PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION RULES. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS, AMONG OTHER REMEDIES,

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ENTITLING THE PLAINTIFF AND THE PURPORTED CLASS TO BENEFITS THAT ARE THE GREATER

OF (X) THE BENEFITS TO WHICH THE MEMBERS OF THE CLASS WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED WITHOUT REGARD TO

THE CONVERSION OF THE BENEFIT PAYOUT FORMULA OF THE AXP PLAN TO A CASH BALANCE FORMULA AND (Y) THE

BENEFITS UNDER THE AXP PLAN WITH REGARD TO THE CASH BALANCE FORMULA. THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS PRE-

AND POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST AND ATTORNEYS FEES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY HAS FILED A MOTION WITH

THE COURT SEEKING TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY FILED A LAWSUIT CAPTIONED

AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED

SERVICES COMPANY, INC. V. VISA USA INC., MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC. ET AL.

IN THE U.S.

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED MONETARY

DAMAGES AGAINST VISA, MASTERCARD AND EIGHT MAJOR BANKS THAT ARE OR WERE MEMBERS OF THE TWO CARD

ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE BUSINESS LOST AS A RESULT OF THE ILLEGAL, ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES OF THE

CARD ASSOCIATIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY LOCKED THE COMPANY OUT OF THE BANK-ISSUED CARD BUSINESS IN THE

UNITED STATES. THE LAWSUIT FOLLOWS THE U.S. SUPREME COURTS OCTOBER 2004 DECISION NOT TO HEAR AN

APPEAL FROM VISA AND MASTERCARD THAT SOUGHT TO OVERTURN A LOWER COURT RULING THAT FOUND THE TWO

CARD ASSOCIATIONS IN VIOLATION OF U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. SINCE FILING THE ACTION, TRS HAS

VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED ITS CLAIMS AGAINST THE FOLLOWING BANK DEFENDANTS: BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., BANK

OF AMERICA CORPORATION (INCLUDING ITS SUBSIDIARIES FLEET BANK (RI), N.A. AND FLEET NATIONAL BANK),

HOUSEHOLD BANK, N.A., HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND USAA FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

U.S. CARD SERVICES AND GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES MATTERS

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED IN A NUMBER OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE AN UNLAWFUL ANTITRUST TYING ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CHARGE CARDS, CREDIT CARDS AND

DEBIT CARDS IN VIOLATION OF VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: (I)

THE

MARCUS CORPORATION V. AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY ET AL.

, U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (FILED JULY 2004). THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND

AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. UPON MOTION TO THE COURT BY THE COMPANY, THE VENUE OF THE COHEN

RESE AND ITALIAN COLORS ACTIONS WAS MOVED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

NEW YORK (SDNY) IN DECEMBER 2003. EACH OF THE ABOVE-LISTED ACTIONS (EXCEPT FOR HAYAMA) IS NOW

PENDING IN THE SDNY, CONSOLIDATED AS IN RE AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANTS LITIGATION. ON APRIL 30,

2004, THE COMPANY FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS ALL THE ACTIONS FILED PRIOR TO SUCH DATE THAT WERE

PENDING IN THE SDNY, AND ON MARCH 15, 2006, SUCH MOTION WAS GRANTED, WITH THE COURT FINDING THE

CLAIMS OF THE PLAINTIFFS TO BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. PLAINTIFFS ASKED THE COURT TO RECONSIDER

ITS DISMISSAL. THAT REQUEST WAS DENIED. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THE COURTS ARBITRATION

RULING. IN ADDITION, DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE MOTION IN THE SDNY, THE COMPANY HAD ASKED THE

CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT HEARING THE HAYAMA ACTION REFERENCED ABOVE TO STAY THAT ACTION PENDING

RESOLUTION OF SUCH MOTION. THE COMPANY ALSO FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE ACTION FILED BY THE

MARCUS CORPORATION, WHICH WAS DENIED IN JULY 2005. NONETHELESS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE

THAT IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES AND WILL CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THE MARCUS ACTION.

IN DECEMBER 2004, A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED

NATIONAL SUPERMARKETS ASSOCIATION,

INC., MASCARI ENTERPRISES, INC. D/B/A SOUND STATIONS, AND BUNDA STARR CORP. D/B/A BRITE WINES AND

SPIRITS V. MBNA AMERICA BANK, N.A., MBNA CORP., CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA) N.A. AND CITIGROUP,

INCORPORATED

, WAS FILED IN THE SDNY. THE ACTION IS A LAWSUIT RELATED TO THE ANTITRUST TYING

ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY IS NOT NAMED AS A DEFENDANT,

THE PLAINTIFFS IN THIS ACTION ARE ALSO PLAINTIFFS IN THE DIRECT ACTIONS AGAINST AMERICAN EXPRESS

DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH. THIS LAWSUIT ALLEGES THAT, BY AGREEING TO ISSUE AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS, MBNA AND CITIBANK HAVE CONSPIRED WITH THE COMPANY IN THE ALLEGED WRONGFUL

TYING ARRANGEMENT DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS LAWSUIT IS

WITHOUT MERIT AND IS CONTRARY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICES SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO RENDER

UNENFORCEABLE VISAS AND MASTERCARDS RULES THAT PREVENTED

BANKS FROM ISSUING AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THAT THIS LAWSUIT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO

THE SAME DEFENSES AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY IN THE DIRECT ACTIONS FILED AGAINST IT, WHICH ARE

DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH. IN THE MARCH 15, 2006 DECISION DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING

PARAGRAPH, THE SDNY DENIED THE COMPANYS REQUEST TO INTERVENE IN THIS ACTION AND DENIED THE MOTION

OF MBNA AND CITIBANK TO DISMISS THE ACTION. THE COURT DID, HOWEVER, STAY THE ACTION AGAINST MBNA

AND CITIBANK PENDING THE ARBITRATION OF THE CLAIMS MADE AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE ACTIONS

DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.

IN AUGUST 2005, A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED

PERFORMANCE LABS INC. V. AMERICAN

EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. (TRS), MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED, VISA

USA, INC. ET AL.

WAS FILED IN THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. THE

ACTION WAS THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE

COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANYS POLICY PROHIBITING MERCHANTS FROM IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE

USE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS THAT ARE NOT IMPOSED EQUALLY ON OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT VIOLATES U.S.

ANTITRUST LAWS. THE SUIT SOUGHT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. TRS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY LEARNED THAT TWO ADDITIONAL PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS THAT MADE ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO

THOSE MADE IN THE PERFORMANCE LABS ACTION HAD ALSO BEEN FILED.

518 RESTAURANT CORP. V. AMERICAN

EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC., MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED, VISA USA,

(FILED IN OCTOBER 2005 IN THE U.S.

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK). THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS SOUGHT

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE 518 RESTAURANT CORP. ACTION WAS VOLUNTARILY WITHDRAWN WITHOUT TRS EVER

HAVING BEEN SERVED WITH THE COMPLAINT. THE COMPLAINT IN THE LEPKOWSKI ACTION WAS ALSO NEVER SERVED.

THE LEPKOWSKI AND PERFORMANCE LABS CASES WERE CONSOLIDATED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES IN A LARGER MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION INVOLVING

OTHER NAMED DEFENDANTS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE COMPANY, AND ALL PROCEEDINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED

ACTION WERE STAYED PENDING THE FILING OF A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT. SUCH CONSOLIDATED

AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON APRIL 24, 2006, BUT THE COMPANY WAS NOT NAMED IN THAT ACTION. OTHER

DEFENDANTS, NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE COMPANY, WERE NAMED. HOWEVER, ON APRIL 18, 2006, PERFORMANCE

LABS, INC., JOSEPH LEPKOWSKI, DDS D/B/A OAK PARK DENTAL STUDIO, AND JASA INC. FILED AN ACTION IN

THE SDNY AGAINST AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY,

INC. THIS COMPLAINT CHALLENGES THE COMPANYS ANTI-STEERING RULES AS UNLAWFUL UNDER THE ANTITRUST

LAWS. AS ALLEGED BY PLAINTIFFS, THESE RULES PREVENT MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING CONSUMERS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCENTIVES TO USE ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF PAYMENTS WHEN CONSUMERS WISH TO USE AN AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED CARD. ORIGINALLY PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT ONLY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF BUT HAVE SINCE AMENDED

THEIR COMPLAINT TO ALSO SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES. THESE PLAINTIFFS HAVE AGREED THAT A STAY WOULD BE

IMPOSED WITH REGARD TO THEIR RESPECTIVE ACTIONS PENDING THE APPEAL OF THE COURTS ARBITRATION

RULING DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NAMED IN SEVERAL PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS IN VARIOUS STATE COURTS ALLEGING

THAT THE COMPANY VIOLATED THE RESPECTIVE STATES LAWS BY WRONGFULLY COLLECTING AMOUNTS ASSESSED ON

CONVERTING TRANSACTIONS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO U.S. DOLLARS AND/OR FAILING TO PROPERLY

DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH AMOUNTS IN ITS CARDMEMBER AGREEMENTS AND BILLING STATEMENTS. THE

PLAINTIFFS IN THE ACTIONS SEEK, AMONG OTHER REMEDIES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, MONEY DAMAGES AND/OR

ATTORNEYS FEES ON THEIR OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF THE PUTATIVE CLASS OF PERSONS SIMILARLY

SITUATED. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA GRANTED

FINAL APPROVAL OF A NATIONWIDE CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT TO RESOLVE ALL LAWSUITS AND ALLEGATIONS WITH

RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS COLLECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF FEES ASSESSED ON TRANSACTIONS MADE IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES IN THE CASE CAPTIONED

LIPUMA V. AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL

RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. AND AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK

(FILED IN AUGUST 2003). THE

SETTLEMENT APPROVED BY THE COURT CALLS FOR THE COMPANY TO (A) DEPOSIT $75 MILLION INTO A FUND THAT

WILL BE USED TO REIMBURSE CLASS MEMBERS WITH VALID CLAIMS, MAKE CERTAIN CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHARITABLE

ORGANIZATIONS TO BE IDENTIFIED LATER AND PAY ATTORNEYS FEES AND (B) MAKE CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE

DISCLOSURES IN ITS CARDMEMBER AGREEMENTS AND BILLING STATEMENTS REGARDING ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY

CONVERSION PRACTICES (WHICH IT HAS ALREADY DONE). THE COMPANY HAD PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RESERVES

TO COVER THE PAYMENT THAT WILL BE MADE TO REIMBURSE CLASS MEMBERS AND PAY ATTORNEYS FEES. THE

COURTS APPROVAL ORDER ENJOINS ALL OTHER PROCEEDINGS THAT MAKE RELATED ALLEGATIONS PENDING A FINAL

APPROVAL HEARING INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING CASES: (I)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOREIGN CONVERSION RATES AND IN THE INCLUSION OF ARBITRATION CLAUSES IN CERTAIN OF THEIR CARDMEMBER

AGREEMENTS. THE SUIT SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES. THE CLASS IS DEFINED AS

ALL VISA, MASTERCARD AND DINERS CLUB GENERAL PURPOSE CARDHOLDERS WHO USED CARDS ISSUED BY ANY OF

THE MDL DEFENDANT BANKS.... AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDHOLDERS ARE NOT PART OF THE CLASS. IN SEPTEMBER

2005, THE COURT DENIED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE ACTION AND PRELIMINARILY CERTIFIED AN

INJUNCTION CLASS OF VISA AND MASTERCARD CARDHOLDERS TO DETERMINE THE VALIDITY OF VISAS AND

MASTERCARDS CARDMEMBER ARBITRATION CLAUSES. AMERICAN EXPRESS FILED A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

WITH THE COURT, WHICH MOTION WAS DENIED IN SEPTEMBER 2006. THE COMPANY HAS FILED AN APPEAL FROM

THE DISTRICT COURTS ORDER DENYING ITS MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2007, THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT DENIED PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO DISMISS THAT

APPEAL. THE COMPANY HAD ALSO ASKED THE APPELLATE COURT TO ENTERTAIN AN INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL OF THE

DISTRICT COURTS CERTIFICATION OF AN INJUNCTION CLASS. ON DECEMBER 19, 2006, THAT APPELLATE COURT

DENIED THAT REQUEST.

IN JANUARY 2006, IN A MATTER CAPTIONED

HOFFMAN, ET AL. V. AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED

SERVICES COMPANY, INC.,

NO. 2001-02281, SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF

ALAMEDA, THE COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS ACTION AGAINST TRS. TWO CLASSES WERE CERTIFIED: (1) ALL

PERSONS WHO HELD AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARDS WITH BILLING ADDRESSES IN CALIFORNIA WHO PURCHASED

AMERICAN EXPRESS FEE-BASED TRAVEL-RELATED INSURANCE PLANS FROM SEPTEMBER 6, 1995, THROUGH A DATE

TO BE DETERMINED; AND (2) ALL PERSONS WHO HELD AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARDS WITH BILLING ADDRESSES

IN STATES OTHER THAN CALIFORNIA AND WHO PURCHASED AMERICAN EXPRESS FEE-BASED TRAVEL-RELATED

INSURANCE PLANS FROM SEPTEMBER 6, 1995, THROUGH A DATE TO BE DETERMINED. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT

AMERICAN EXPRESS VIOLATED CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK LAW BY ALLEGEDLY BILLING CUSTOMERS FOR FLIGHT AND

BAGGAGE INSURANCE THAT THEY DID NOT RECEIVE. AMERICAN EXPRESS DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS AND FILED AN

INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL (KNOWN AS A PETITION FOR A WRIT OF MANDATE) OF THE CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER.

IN JUNE 2006, THE APPELLATE COURT DENIED JURISDICTION OVER THAT INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL. AMERICAN

EXPRESS ALSO APPEALED THE DENIAL OF ITS MOTION TO COMPEL INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF ALL

NON-CALIFORNIA CLASS MEMBERS. THE APPELLATE COURT HAS JURISDICTION OVER THAT APPEAL AND THE APPEAL

IS PENDING. IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK A MATTER MAKING RELATED

ALLEGATIONS TO THOSE RAISED IN HOFFMAN IS PENDING. THAT MATTER, CAPTIONED

ENVIRONMENT LAW

ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS V. AMERICAN EXPRESS ET AL.

, HAD EFFECTIVELY BEEN STAYED PENDING THE

PROCEEDINGS IN THE HOFFMAN ACTION. IN OCTOBER 2006, THE COURT IN THE ENVIRONMENT LAW ACTION ENTERED

AN ORDER SCHEDULING A PRE-MOTION CONFERENCE ON AMERICAN EXPRESS ANTICIPATED MOTION TO COMPEL

ARBITRATION FOR JANUARY 31, 2007. THAT DATE HAS SINCE BEEN EXTENDED TO MARCH 5, 2007.

ALL PERSONS WHO APPLIED FOR AND RECEIVED AN AMERICAN EXPRESS BLUE CASH CARD DURING THE PERIOD FROM

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 TO THE PRESENT AND WHO DID NOT GET THE REBATE OR REBATES PROVIDED FOR IN THE

OFFER. ON DECEMBER 1, 2006, HOWEVER, PLAINTIFF FILED A FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT DROPPING THE

INTERNATIONAL MATTERS

AS DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, IN RECENT YEARS, U.S. AND FOREIGN REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES, TOGETHER WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE RAISED INCREASING CONCERNS OVER THE

ABILITY OF CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CORRUPT PERSONS TO USE GLOBAL FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES TO

FACILITATE MONEY LAUNDERING. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS ISSUED

REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO THE U.S. PATRIOT ACT THAT SPECIFICALLY IMPACT CERTAIN MONEY LAUNDERING

PREVENTION ACTIVITIES OF ENTITIES INVOLVED, AS AEBL IS, IN CORRESPONDENT AND PRIVATE BANKING

ACTIVITIES. COMPLIANCE EFFORTS TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING REMAIN A HIGH PRIORITY FOR AEBL AND IT

HAS INCREASED THESE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS EVOLVING REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY STANDARDS AND

REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH AEBL DOES BUSINESS. THE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ARE EXERCISING HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY OF THE

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND HAVE

TAKEN ACTION AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR DEFICIENCIES IN SUCH

PROGRAMS. IN EARLY 2004, AEBI, A SUBSIDIARY OF

AEBL HEADQUARTERED IN MIAMI, RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) RELATING TO

CERTAIN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS. IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE DOJ INFORMED AEBI OF CONCERNS RELATING TO AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN

ACTION. AEBI HAS BEEN COOPERATING WITH THE DOJ.

IN MAY 2006, IN A MATTER CAPTIONED

MARCOTTE V. BANK OF MONTREAL ET AL.

ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE, SCOTIABANK, NATIONAL BANK OF CANADA,

LAURENTIAN BANK OF CANADA AND CITIBANK CANADA. THE ACTION ALLEGES THAT CONVERSION COMMISSIONS MADE

ON FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS ARE CREDIT CHARGES UNDER THE QUEBEC CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (THE

QCPA) AND CANNOT BE CHARGED PRIOR TO THE 21-DAY GRACE PERIOD UNDER THE QCPA. THE CLASS INCLUDES

ALL PERSONS HOLDING A CREDIT CARD ISSUED BY ONE OF THE DEFENDANTS TO WHOM FEES WERE CHARGED SINCE

APRIL 17, 2000, FOR TRANSACTIONS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY BEFORE EXPIRATION OF THE PERIOD OF 21

DAYS FOLLOWING THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT. THE CLASS CLAIMS REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY

CONVERSIONS, CDN $400 PER CLASS MEMBER FOR TROUBLE, INCONVENIENCE AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INTEREST

AND FEES AND COSTS.

IN MARCH 2006, A MOTION TO AUTHORIZE A CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED
