BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES (AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE

COMPANY, WE, US OR

OUR), IS A GLOBAL SERVICE COMPANY THAT PROVIDES

CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO PRODUCTS, INSIGHTS AND EXPERIENCES THAT

ENRICH LIVES AND BUILD BUSINESS SUCCESS. OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES ARE CHARGE AND CREDIT PAYMENT CARD PRODUCTS AND

TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES OFFERED TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES

AROUND THE WORLD. WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1850 AS A JOINT STOCK

ASSOCIATION. WE WERE INCORPORATED IN 1965 AS A NEW YORK

CORPORATION. AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPAL

OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES

COMPANY, INC. (TRS), ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 (THE BHC

ACT), SUBJECT TO THE SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE

FEDERAL RESERVE).

OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK IN LOWER

MANHATTAN. WE ALSO HAVE OFFICES IN OTHER LOCATIONS IN NORTH

AMERICA, AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

WE ARE PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED IN BUSINESSES COMPRISING FOUR

REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: U.S. CARD SERVICES,

INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES, GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES, AND

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES, ALL OF WHICH WE

DESCRIBE BELOW. CORPORATE FUNCTIONS AND AUXILIARY BUSINESSES,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP, PUBLISHING

BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY OPERATIONS, ARE INCLUDED IN

THE COMPANYS RESULTS FOR 2010 REFLECTED STRONG SPENDING

GROWTH AND IMPROVED CREDIT PERFORMANCE. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR

CARDMEMBER SPENDING VOLUMES GREW BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND

INTERNATIONALLY, AND ACROSS ALL OF THE COMPANYS

BUSINESSES. CARDMEMBER SPENDING LEVELS IN 2010 REACHED RECORD

LEVELS AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IMPROVING CREDIT TRENDS

CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN LOAN AND RECEIVABLE WRITE-OFFS

AND THE REDUCTION OF LOSS RESERVE LEVELS OVER THE COURSE OF 2010

WHEN COMPARED TO 2009. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR

BENEFITS FROM IMPROVING CREDIT TRENDS WILL DECREASE OVER THE

COURSE OF 2011. WHILE THE COMPANY INVESTED AT HISTORICALLY HIGH

LEVELS IN 2010, IT INTENDS TO MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY TO SCALE

BACK ON INVESTMENTS AS BUSINESS CONDITIONS CHANGE AND THE

BENEFITS REALIZED FROM IMPROVING CREDIT TRENDS LESSEN.

DESPITE IMPROVEMENT IN PARTS OF THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT,

CHALLENGES CLEARLY REMAIN FOR THE COMPANY, BOTH IN THE UNITED

STATES AND IN MANY OTHER KEY REGIONS. THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE

WEAK JOB CREATION, VOLATILE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CONSUMER

BEHAVIOR, AN UNCERTAIN HOUSING MARKET, AND THE REGULATORY AND

LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE UNCERTAIN IMPACT OF THE

CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF

2009 (THE CARD ACT), OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED

DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT

(DODD-FRANK) AND OF THE PROCEEDING AGAINST THE

COMPANY RECENTLY BROUGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

(DOJ) AND CERTAIN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ALLEGING A

VIOLATION OF THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. IN ADDITION, AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, THE COMPANY WILL STOP RECEIVING QUARTERLY

LITIGATION PAYMENTS FROM MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC.

(MASTERCARD) AND VISA INC. (VISA) AT THE

END OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2011, RESPECTIVELY, AND

YEAR-OVER-YEAR

COMPARISONS WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN IN LIGHT OF THE

STRONG 2010 RESULTS.

IN 2011, THE COMPANY WILL BE PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON SEVERAL

INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO HELP US ACCOMPLISH OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH

GOALS: PROVIDING GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS; ADDING MORE WOMEN,

MINORITIES AND YOUNGER ADULTS TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE; ACCELERATING

OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE THE U.S.; MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE

ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP; AND INCREASING OUR SHARE OF ONLINE

SPENDING ACROSS ALL PRODUCTS WHILE TRANSFORMING OUR

CUSTOMERS DIGITAL EXPERIENCE.

WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SEEK MORE WAYS TO TURN EXISTING CAPABILITIES

AND RELATIONSHIPS INTO NEW FEE SERVICES. IN THE PAST EIGHTEEN

MONTHS, WE LAUNCHED OR EXPANDED SEVERAL KEY INITIATIVES,

INCLUDING BUSINESS INSIGHTS, WHICH PROVIDES ANALYTICS AND

CONSULTING SERVICES TO HELP MERCHANTS ATTRACT MORE CUSTOMERS AND

INCREASE SALES, AND ACCEPTPAY, WHICH SIMPLIFIES THE INVOICING

AND PAYMENT PROCESS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. OVERALL, WE SET AN

AGGRESSIVE GOAL TO GENERATE $3 BILLION IN ANNUAL FEE-BASED

REVENUES FOR THE COMPANY BY THE END OF 2014.

FOR A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF OUR 2010 FINANCIAL RESULTS,

INCLUDING FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING EACH OF OUR REPORTABLE

OPERATING SEGMENTS, SEE PAGES 20-120 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF REVENUE,



INTEREST AND FEES ON LOANS, WHICH PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTS

INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES, AND CARD FEES

RELATED TO THE CARDMEMBER LOANS PORTFOLIO.

OUR GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, CARD-ISSUING AND

MERCHANT-ACQUIRING AND PROCESSING BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL IN

SCOPE. WE ARE A WORLD LEADER IN PROVIDING CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS TO CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. THESE

CARDS INCLUDE CARDS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS AS WELL AS CARDS

ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

ACCEPTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (COLLECTIVELY,

CARDS). OUR CARDS PERMIT OUR CARDMEMBERS

(CARDMEMBERS) TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS AND

SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT THE MILLIONS OF

MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD TOTAL WORLDWIDE

CARDS-IN-FORCE

OF 91.0 MILLION (INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES).

IN 2010, OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS (SPENDING ON AMERICAN

EXPRESS

®

CARDS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS

$713 BILLION.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO RECENTLY CREATED AN ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP

TO FOCUS ON GENERATING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE ON A

GLOBAL BASIS, BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, IN

AREAS SUCH AS ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS AND FEE-BASED SERVICES.

FOR A DISCUSSION CONCERNING OUR ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP, PLEASE

SEE CORPORATE & OTHER BELOW.

OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATIONS, ALTHOUGH TRAVEL SALES GENERALLY TEND TO BE HIGHEST

IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS. TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND

TRAVELERS CHEQUES OUTSTANDING TEND TO BE GREATEST EACH YEAR IN

THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD QUARTER. AMERICAN

EXPRESS

®

GIFT CARD SALES ARE HIGHEST IN THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND

DECEMBER; AND CARD BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS.

SPEND-CENTRIC

MODEL IS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

DESPITE THE CONTINUING CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT, WE BELIEVE OUR SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS

MODEL (WHICH FOCUSES ON GENERATING REVENUES PRIMARILY BY DRIVING

SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND SECONDARILY BY FINANCE CHARGES AND

FEES) CONTINUES TO GIVE US SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES.

AVERAGE SPENDING ON OUR CARDS, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER ON

A PER-CARD BASIS FOR US VERSUS OUR COMPETITORS, REPRESENTS

GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN THE FORM OF LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND

HIGHER SALES. THIS ENABLES US TO EARN PREMIUM DISCOUNT RATES AND

THEREBY INVEST IN GREATER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND

CARDMEMBERS. AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER REVENUES GENERATED FROM

HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS, WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO INVEST

IN MORE ATTRACTIVE REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO CARDMEMBERS,

AND TARGETED MARKETING AND OTHER

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROGRAMS AND INVESTMENTS FOR MERCHANTS, ALL OF WHICH IN TURN

CREATE INCENTIVES FOR CARDMEMBERS TO SPEND MORE ON THEIR CARDS.

THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE MAKE IN REWARDS AND OTHER

COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITIONS FOR CARDMEMBERS DRIVE CARD USAGE

AT MERCHANTS AND ENCOURAGE CARDMEMBER LOYALTY. THIS BUSINESS

MODEL, ALONG WITH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, IN WHICH WE ARE BOTH

THE CARD ISSUER AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER,

GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WE SEEK TO LEVERAGE TO

PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS, MERCHANTS AND OUR

CARD-ISSUING PARTNERS.

THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTESTRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY,

QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICEARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR BRAND BY EDUCATING EMPLOYEES ABOUT

THESE ATTRIBUTES AND BY INCORPORATING THEM INTO OUR PROGRAMS,

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR BRAND HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN RATED ONE

OF THE MOST VALUABLE BRANDS IN THE WORLD IN PUBLISHED STUDIES,

AND WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE.

WE BELIEVE OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR

SUCCESS, AND WE INVEST HEAVILY IN MANAGING, MARKETING AND

PROMOTING IT. IN ADDITION, WE PLACE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON

TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS AND PATENTS, AND DILIGENTLY PROTECT

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL

NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES

THE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES

(GNMS) SEGMENT OPERATES A GLOBAL GENERAL-PURPOSE

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK FOR BOTH PROPRIETARY CARDS AND

CARDS ISSUED UNDER THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS. IT ALSO

MANAGES MERCHANT SERVICES GLOBALLY, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING

MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS AS WELL AS PROCESSING AND SETTLING

CARD TRANSACTIONS FOR THOSE MERCHANTS. THIS SEGMENT ALSO OFFERS

MERCHANTS

POINT-OF-SALE,

SERVICING AND SETTLEMENT, FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES, AND

MARKETING AND INFORMATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE ISSUED BY OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATING

SUBSIDIARY, TRS, BY THE COMPANYS U.S. BANK

SUBSIDIARIES, AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK (CENTURION

BANK) AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB (AEBFSB),

AND BY OTHER OPERATING AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES. THEY ARE ACCEPTED AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE

THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. IN ADDITION,

DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE GENERALLY

ACCEPTED AT ATM LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT CARDS. TRS AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ISSUE THE

MAJORITY OF CARDS ON OUR NETWORK.

OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES (GNS) BUSINESS

ESTABLISHES AND MAINTAINS RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS AND OTHER

INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ISSUE CARDS AND, IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, ACQUIRE LOCAL MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK. GNS IS KEY TO OUR STRATEGY OF BROADENING THE CARDMEMBER

AND MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE.

OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES (GMS) BUSINESS PROVIDES

US WITH ACCESS TO RICH TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP

NETWORK, WHICH ENCOMPASSES RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THE

CARDMEMBER AND THE MERCHANT. THIS CAPABILITY HELPS US ACQUIRE

NEW MERCHANTS, DEEPEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING MERCHANTS,

PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, AND PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING, ANALYTICAL

AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS IN OUR NETWORK. IN

ADDITION, IT ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE TRENDS AND SPENDING PATTERNS

AMONG VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE.

GLOBAL

NETWORK SERVICES

WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE A STRATEGY, THROUGH OUR GNS BUSINESS, OF

INVITING U.S. AND FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO

ISSUE CARDS AND ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK. BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL

OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WE BROADEN OUR CARDMEMBER AND

MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. THE GNS BUSINESS HAS

ESTABLISHED 129 CARD-ISSUING

AND/OR

MERCHANT-ACQUIRING ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER

INSTITUTIONS IN 131 COUNTRIES.

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2010, GNS SIGNED FOUR NEW PARTNERS TO ISSUE CARDS

AND/OR

ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. ADDITIONALLY,

GNS PARTNERS LAUNCHED APPROXIMATELY 77 NEW PRODUCTS DURING 2010,

BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS

PARTNER PRODUCTS TO APPROXIMATELY 1,000.

GNS FOCUSES ON PARTNERING WITH QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT CHOOSE TO ISSUE CARDS ACCEPTED

ON OUR GLOBAL NETWORK

AND/OR

ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK. ALTHOUGH WE CUSTOMIZE OUR

NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS TO THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND EACH

PARTNERS REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANS

IN THAT MARKETPLACE, ALL GNS ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP

ISSUERS DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR THEIR HIGHEST-SPENDING AND MOST

AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND TO SUPPORT THE VALUE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS

CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MERCHANTS. WE CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH

INSTITUTIONS THAT SHARE A CORE SET OF ATTRIBUTES COMPATIBLE WITH

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, SUCH AS COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY

STANDARDS AND STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND WE REQUIRE

ADHERENCE TO OUR PRODUCT, BRAND AND SERVICE STANDARDS.**

AS DISCUSSED BELOW, WHILE GNS HAS ADDED SIGNIFICANT PARTNERS IN

2010, A CORE STRATEGY OF GNS IS TO BUILD AND INVEST IN DEEPER

AND MORE MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS EXISTING PARTNERS.

WITH APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DIFFERENT CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED ON OUR

NETWORK SO FAR BY OUR PARTNERS, GNS IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT

BUSINESS THAT IS STRENGTHENING OUR BRAND VISIBILITY AROUND THE

WORLD, DRIVING MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO OUR MERCHANT NETWORK

AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS CARD. GNS ENABLES US TO EXPAND OUR NETWORKS GLOBAL

PRESENCE GENERALLY WITHOUT ASSUMING ADDITIONAL CARDMEMBER CREDIT

RISK OR HAVING TO INVEST A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, AS OUR GNS

PARTNERS ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED ATTRACTIVE CUSTOMER BASES THEY

CAN TARGET WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED PRODUCTS, AND ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE

CARDS THEY ISSUE. SINCE 1999,

CARDS-IN-FORCE

ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS HAVE GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH

RATE OF 24%, AND TOTALED OVER 29 MILLION CARDS AT THE END

OF 2010. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, 75% OF NEW CARDS ISSUED IN

2010 WERE CARDS ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS. SPENDING ON GNS CARDS

HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE OF 25% SINCE 1999.

YEAR-OVER-YEAR

SPENDING GROWTH ON THESE CARDS IN 2010 WAS 28%, WITH TOTAL

SPENDING EQUAL TO $92 BILLION.

IN ASSESSING WHETHER A GIVEN COUNTRY SHOULD BE PROPRIETARY, GNS,

OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF, WE CONSIDER A WIDE RANGE OF

COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS INCLUDING THE STABILITY AND

ATTRACTIVENESS OF RETURNS, THE SIZE OF THE AFFLUENT SEGMENT, THE

STRENGTH OF AVAILABLE MARKETING AND CREDIT DATA, THE SIZE OF

CO-BRAND OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW BEST CAN WE CREATE STRONG

MERCHANT VALUE.

GNS

ARRANGEMENTS

ALTHOUGH THE STRUCTURES AND DETAILS OF EACH OF THE GNS

ARRANGEMENTS VARY, ALL OF THEM GENERATE REVENUES FOR US FROM THE

CARD TRANSACTION VOLUMES THEY DRIVE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK. GROSS REVENUES WE RECEIVE PER DOLLAR SPENT ON A CARD

ISSUED BY A GNS PARTNER ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE FROM OUR

PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GNS

PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE OPERATING COSTS AND RISK

OF ITS CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND CREDIT

LOSSES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE IN OUR PROPRIETARY

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. THE GNS BUSINESS MODEL GENERATES AN

ATTRACTIVE EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE THAT REQUIRES A

LOWER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SUPPORT. THE RETURN ON EQUITY IN OUR GNS

BUSINESS CAN THUS BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR

PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE

MAJORITY OF GNS COSTS ARE FIXED, THE GNS BUSINESS IS HIGHLY

SCALABLE. GNS PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE

REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND AND DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCT

OFFERINGS WITH INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.

OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS FALL INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE MAIN

CATEGORIES: INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS, NETWORK CARD

LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS AND JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS.

** THE USE OF THE TERM

PARTNER OR PARTNERING DOES NOT MEAN OR

IMPLY A FORMAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP, AND IS NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY TO

ALTER THE TERMS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS RELATIONSHIP WITH

THIRD-PARTY ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEPENDENT

OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS

THE FIRST TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS AN INDEPENDENT

OPERATOR (IO) ARRANGEMENT. AS OF THE END OF 2010, WE

HAD 64 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. WE PURSUE THESE

ARRANGEMENTS TO EXPAND THE PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT OFFER A PROPRIETARY

LOCAL CURRENCY CARD. THE PARTNERS LOCAL PRESENCE AND

RELATIONSHIPS HELP US ENHANCE THE IMPACT OF OUR BRAND IN THE

COUNTRY, REACH MERCHANT COVERAGE GOALS MORE QUICKLY, AND OPERATE

AT ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US

TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. SUBJECT TO MEETING OUR STANDARDS, IO BANK

PARTNERS ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS IN THEIR

COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE CLASSIC GREEN, GOLD AND PLATINUM

AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF THESE

PARTNERS SERVE AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR FOR LOCAL

MERCHANTS. AMERICAN EXPRESS RETAINS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

MULTINATIONAL MERCHANTS. OUR IO PARTNERS OWN THE CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIT RISK FOR THE CARDS THEY ISSUE, AND MAKE

THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL BE ISSUED CARDS. GNS

GENERATES REVENUES IN IO ARRANGEMENTS FROM CARD LICENSING FEES,

ROYALTIES ON CARDMEMBER BILLINGS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONVERSION

REVENUE, ROYALTIES ON CHARGE VOLUME AT MERCHANTS, SHARE OF

DISCOUNT REVENUE AND, IN SOME PARTNERSHIPS, ROYALTIES ON NET

SPREAD REVENUE OR ROYALTIES ON

CARDS-IN-FORCE.

OUR IO PARTNERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION,

BILLING AND PRICING, CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT SERVICING, AND

FUNDING CARD RECEIVABLES FOR THEIR CARDS AND PAYABLES FOR THEIR

MERCHANTS.

WE BEAR THE CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM THE IO PARTNERS

POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE

MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE

BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS,

AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH

THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN

ADDITION, DEPENDING ON AN IO PARTNERS CREDIT RATING AND

OTHER INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN IO

PARTNER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER

COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE ENTERED INTO IO ARRANGEMENTS

INCLUDE BRAZIL, RUSSIA, CHINA, INDONESIA, TURKEY, ECUADOR,

GREECE, SOUTH KOREA, PAKISTAN, CROATIA, PERU, PORTUGAL AND

VIETNAM. THROUGH OUR IO PARTNERSHIPS, WE BELIEVE WE CAN

ACCELERATE GROWTH IN CARDMEMBER SPENDING,

CARDS-IN-FORCE

AND MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE IN THESE COUNTRIES.

NETWORK

CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS

THE SECOND TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS A NETWORK CARD

LICENSE (NCL). AT THE END OF 2010, WE HAD 61 OF

THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE WORLDWIDE. WE PURSUE THESE

ARRANGEMENTS TO INCREASE OUR BRAND PRESENCE AND GAIN SHARE IN

COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE A PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING

AND/OR

MERCHANT ACQUIRING BUSINESS AND, IN A FEW CASES, THOSE IN WHICH

WE HAVE IO PARTNERS. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, WE GRANT THE

THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION A LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. THE NCL ISSUER OWNS THE CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS FOR ALL CARDS IT ISSUES, PROVIDES CUSTOMER SERVICE

TO ITS CARDMEMBERS, AUTHORIZES TRANSACTIONS, MANAGES BILLING AND

CREDIT, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MARKETING THE CARDS, AND DESIGNS CARD

PRODUCT FEATURES (INCLUDING REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR

CARDMEMBERS), SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS. WE OPERATE

THE MERCHANT NETWORK, ROUTE AND PROCESS CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM

THE MERCHANTS

POINT-OF-SALE

THROUGH SUBMISSION TO THE ISSUER, AND SETTLE WITH ISSUERS. THE

NCL IS THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED WITH BANKS IN

THE UNITED STATES, UNITED KINGDOM, AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN.

GNS REVENUES IN NCL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY A VARIETY

OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING,

ROYALTIES, CURRENCY CONVERSIONS AND LICENSING FEES PAID BY THE

PARTNER AND FEES CHARGED TO THE CARD ISSUER BASED ON CHARGE

VOLUME, AND OUR PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SUCH AS

CARDMEMBER INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER CARD FEATURES AND

BENEFITS FOR THE ISSUERS CARDS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THE

NCL ISSUER BEARS THE CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL

AS THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION COSTS, CARDMEMBER FRAUD

RISKS AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND OTHER LOYALTY INITIATIVES. WE

BEAR THE RISK ARISING FROM THE NCL PARTNERS POTENTIAL

FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE

THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY

MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE

TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC

AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION,

DEPENDING ON AN NCL ISSUERS CREDIT RATING AND

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN NCL

ISSUER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER

COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

EXAMPLES OF NCL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANK

OF AMERICA IN THE UNITED STATES, LLOYDS TSB BANK IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM AND WESTPAC BANKING CORPORATION IN AUSTRALIA.

JOINT

VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS

THE THIRD TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS A JOINT VENTURE

(JV) ARRANGEMENT. WE HAVE UTILIZED THIS TYPE OF

ARRANGEMENT IN SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM, AS WELL AS IN OTHER

COUNTRIES. IN THESE COUNTRIES, WE JOIN WITH A THIRD-PARTY TO

ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN WHICH WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

OWNERSHIP STAKE. THE JV TYPICALLY SIGNS NEW MERCHANTS TO THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND ISSUES LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS THAT

CARRY OUR LOGO. IN A JV ARRANGEMENT, THE JV IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

THE CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK AND BEARS THE OPERATING AND MARKETING

COSTS. UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO TYPES OF GNS ARRANGEMENTS, WE SHARE

MANAGEMENT, RISK, AND PROFIT AND LOSS RESPONSIBILITY WITH OUR JV

PARTNERS. INCOME IS GENERATED BY DISCOUNT REVENUES, CARD FEES

AND NET SPREAD REVENUES. THE ECONOMICS OF THE JV ARE SIMILAR TO

THOSE OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, WHICH WE DISCUSS

UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES, AND WE RECEIVE A

PORTION OF THE JVS INCOME DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST. OUR SUBSIDIARY,

AEOCC LTD., PURCHASES CARD RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF THE GNS

JVS FROM TIME TO TIME.

MERCHANT SERVICES

WE OPERATE A GMS BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING MERCHANTS TO

ACCEPT CARDS, ACCEPTING AND PROCESSING CARD TRANSACTIONS, AND

SETTLING WITH MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS FOR PURCHASES MADE BY

CARDMEMBERS WITH CARDS (CHARGES). WE ALSO PROVIDE

MARKETING INFORMATION, AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO

MERCHANTS, LEVERAGING THE CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY OUR

INVESTMENTS IN OUR CLOSED-LOOP STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS

POINT-OF-SALE

PRODUCTS, SERVICING, AND FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS FOR CARDMEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE CARD

WHEREVER AND HOWEVER THEY DESIRE, AND TO INCREASE MERCHANT

COVERAGE IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND IN SELECTED NEW INDUSTRIES

THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED THE CARD. WE ADD NEW

MERCHANTS TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER OF SALES CHANNELS: A

PROPRIETARY SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY SALES AND SERVICE AGENTS,

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH BANKS AND PROCESSORS, THE INTERNET,

TELEMARKETING AND INBOUND WANT TO HONOR CALLS (I.E.,

WHERE MERCHANTS DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD CONTACT US

DIRECTLY). AS DISCUSSED IN THE GLOBAL NETWORK

SERVICES SECTION, OUR IO PARTNERS AND JVS ALSO ADD NEW

LOCAL MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

DURING 2010, WE CONTINUED EXPANDING OUR INTEGRATED AMERICAN

EXPRESS

ONEPOINT

®

SOLUTION FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS IN THE UNITED

STATES. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE AGENTS PROVIDE

PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES TO MERCHANTS ON OUR BEHALF FOR CARD

TRANSACTIONS, WHILE WE RETAIN THE ACCEPTANCE CONTRACT WITH

PARTICIPATING MERCHANTS, MANAGE MERCHANT PRICING DECISIONS AND

NEGOTIATIONS, AND RECEIVE THE SAME TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION WE

ALWAYS HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. THIS

PROGRAM SIMPLIFIES CARD PROCESSING FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED

MERCHANTS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH A SINGLE SOURCE FOR STATEMENTS,

SETTLEMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE ARE NOW FOLLOWING A SIMILAR

STRATEGY TO OUR ONEPOINT SOLUTION IN SPAIN THROUGH OUR

ARRANGEMENT WITH LA CAIXA, ONE OF SPAINS LARGEST

ACQUIRERS.

GMS CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS

THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES

THAT ACCEPT THE CARD. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE

FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE USE OF OUR CARDS FOR

EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 64% OF OUR U.S. BILLINGS CAME

FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 36% CAME FROM

RETAIL AND OTHER SECTORS. THAT PROPORTION HAS NOW BEEN MORE THAN

REVERSED. IN 2010, U.S. NON-TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT

BILLINGS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 71.5% OF THE U.S. BILLED

BUSINESS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. THIS SHIFT RESULTED, IN

PART, FROM THE GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS THAT

BEGAN TO ACCEPT CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN RESPONSE TO

CONSUMERS INCREASED DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR MORE OF

THEIR PURCHASES, OUR FOCUS ON EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MEET

CARDMEMBERS NEEDS, AND INCREASED COMPETITION FROM OUR

COMPETITORS FOR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR SPENDING.

DURING 2010, WE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO BRING CARD ACCEPTANCE

TO INDUSTRIES WHERE CASH OR CHECKS ARE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF

PAYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE MADE HEADWAY IN PROMOTING CARD

ACCEPTANCE IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS PHARMACEUTICALS, CONSTRUCTION,

INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY, INSURANCE AND ADVERTISING. CARD ACCEPTANCE

AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN 2010 IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE.



MERCURY INSURANCE GROUP, A LEADING INSURANCE COMPANY



BDO USA, LLP, A LEADING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FIRM PROVIDING

ASSURANCE, TAX, FINANCIAL ADVISORY AND CONSULTING SERVICES



APPLIED MEDICAL, A GLOBAL MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS,

MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS MEDICAL DEVICES USED IN SURGICAL

PROCEDURES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERNATIONALLY, AMONG OTHERS, CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WERE

REACHED WITH.

COLLECTIONS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY IN PUERTO RICO & THE

CARIBBEAN



MUNICIPIO DE NAUCALPAN IN MEXICO



AAMI, ONE OF AUSTRALIAS LARGEST AND HIGHEST PROFILE

GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANIES



AGEAS INSURANCE SOLUTIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUED OUR DRIVE TO EXPAND CARD ACCEPTANCE

FOR RETAIL AND EVERYDAY SPENDING CATEGORIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2010, WE ANNOUNCED CARD ACCEPTANCE

AGREEMENTS WITH.



SEVEN ELEVEN, NOW ACCEPTING THE CARD IN MEXICO



BEST BUY, NOW ACCEPTING THE CARD IN THE UNITED KINGDOM



KAISERS TENGELMANN AG, NOW AN ACCEPTING SUPERMARKET

MERCHANT IN GERMANY.

GLOBALLY, ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS

CONTINUES TO INCREASE. AS IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2010, WE

CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE OF CARDS AROUND THE WORLD

AND TO REFINE OUR APPROACH TO CALCULATING MERCHANT COVERAGE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

THAT, AS OF THE END OF 2010, OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE UNITED

STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN 90% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS

GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING, AND OUR

INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT NETWORK AS A WHOLE ACCOMMODATED

APPROXIMATELY 80% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE BASED ON

COMPARING OUR CARDMEMBERS SPENDING ON OUR NETWORK

CURRENTLY WITH OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT OUR CARDMEMBERS WOULD SPEND

ON OUR NETWORK IF ALL MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT GENERAL-PURPOSE

CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS ACCEPTED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

WE EARN DISCOUNT REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO

MERCHANTS FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AS PAYMENT FOR GOODS OR SERVICES

SOLD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS THE FEE CHARGED TO THE MERCHANT

FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AND IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE

OF THE AMOUNT CHARGED ON A CARD. IN SOME INSTANCES, AN

ADDITIONAL FLAT TRANSACTION FEE IS ASSESSED. THE MERCHANT

DISCOUNT IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT

THAT THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER (IN MOST CASES, INCLUDING

FOR ALL U.S. MERCHANTS, TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES)

PAYS TO A MERCHANT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS

THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE MERCHANT,

ACCEPTS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANT, PAYS THE MERCHANT FOR

THESE TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS NETWORK, WHICH SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE

APPROPRIATE CARD ISSUER. WHEN A CARDMEMBER PRESENTS THE CARD FOR

PAYMENT, THE MERCHANT CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR THE

TRANSACTION AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT.

TO THE EXTENT THAT TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS THE

MERCHANT ACQUIRER, THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS RECORDED BY US AS

DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE TIME THE TRANSACTION IS RECEIVED BY US

FROM THE MERCHANT.

WHERE WE ACT AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE CARD PRESENTED AT

A MERCHANT IS ISSUED BY A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF OUR GNS PARTNERS, WE WILL

MAKE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT TO THE MERCHANT AND RECEIVE THE

DISCOUNT REVENUE. IN OUR ROLE AS THE OPERATOR OF THE CARD

NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO RECEIVE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT FROM THE CARD

ISSUER, WHO RECEIVES AN ISSUER RATE (I.E., THE INDIVIDUALLY

NEGOTIATED AMOUNT THAT CARD ISSUERS RECEIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS

CHARGED ON OUR NETWORK WITH CARDS THEY ISSUE, WHICH IS USUALLY

EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGED AMOUNT). THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT REVENUE (RECEIVED BY US IN THE FORM OF THE

MERCHANT DISCOUNT) AND THE ISSUER RATE RECEIVED BY THE CARD

ISSUER GENERATES A RETURN TO US. IN CASES WHERE AMERICAN EXPRESS

IS THE CARD ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A THIRD-PARTY

BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (WHICH CAN BE THE CASE IN A

COUNTRY IN WHICH THE IO IS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER), WE

RECEIVE AN INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED ISSUER RATE IN OUR SETTLEMENT

WITH THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WHICH IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT

REVENUE. BY CONTRAST WITH NETWORKS SUCH AS VISA AND MASTERCARD,

THERE IS NO COLLECTIVELY SET INTERCHANGE RATE ON THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS NETWORK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMS DEPICT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE

PARTIES IN A

POINT-OF-SALE

TRANSACTION EFFECTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK WHERE WE

ACT AS BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND MERCHANT ACQUIRER (THE

3-PARTY MODEL) AND UNDER AN NCL ARRANGEMENT WHERE

THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACT AS CARD ISSUERS (THE

NCL MODEL).

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT WE CHARGE REFLECTS THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO

THE MERCHANT AND GENERALLY REPRESENTS A PREMIUM OVER THE RATES

CHARGED FOR ACCEPTANCE OF MANY CARDS ISSUED ON OTHER NETWORKS.

WE DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS,

INCLUDING THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS RELATIVE TO

USERS OF CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETING CARD NETWORKS, OUR PRODUCT

AND NETWORK FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY, OUR MARKETING EXPERTISE

AND PROGRAMS, INFORMATION SERVICES, FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES,

AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WHICH ENHANCE THE MERCHANT VALUE

PROPOSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD.

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT VARIES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WITH THE

INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE MERCHANT DOES BUSINESS, THE

MERCHANTS CHARGE VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT

TO THE MERCHANT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN

CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF THE CARD ACCEPTANCE

AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH US (LOCAL OR GLOBAL) AND THE CHARGE AMOUNT.

IN PRIOR YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SOME REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL

WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE. THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT

RATE WAS 2.55 PERCENT AND 2.54 PERCENT FOR 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY. OVER TIME, CERTAIN REPRICING INITIATIVES,

CHANGES IN THE MIX OF BUSINESS AND VOLUME-RELATED PRICING

DISCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN SOME EROSION OF

THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE.

WHILE MOST MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS UNDERSTAND OUR

MERCHANT DISCOUNT PRICING IN RELATION TO THE VALUE PROVIDED, WE

DO ENCOUNTER A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT

OUR CARDS, BUT TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER TO ACCEPT

ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO SUPPRESS USE OF THE

CARD. SUBJECT TO LOCAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS (SUCH AS, BY WAY OF

EXAMPLE, DODD-FRANK), WE RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE VIGOROUSLY TO

ENSURE THAT OUR CARDMEMBERS ARE ABLE TO USE THEIR CARD WHERE AND

WHEN THEY WANT TO AND TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND. WE

HAVE MADE PROGRESS LIMITING CARD SUPPRESSION BY FOCUSING ON

ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD;

CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE PROVIDE TO MERCHANTS THROUGH

PROGRAMS SUCH AS DAILYWISH AND AMERICAN EXPRESS SELECTS, WHICH

ENABLE MERCHANTS OF

CARDMEMBERS; DEVELOPING AND PROVIDING NEW AND INNOVATIVE

BUSINESS INSIGHTS, MARKETING PROGRAMS AND FRAUD PREVENTION TOOLS

USING INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK;

PROVIDING BETTER AND EARLIER COMMUNICATION OF OUR VALUE

PROPOSITION; AND, WHEN APPROPRIATE, EXERCISING OUR RIGHT TO

TERMINATE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS WHO SEEK TO

SUPPRESS THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS. WE HAVE A CLIENT

MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION WHICH IS DEDICATED TO GROWING OUR

MERCHANT CUSTOMERS BUSINESS AND FINDING WAYS TO ENHANCE

EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE KEY BUSINESS

PARTNERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS THE

MERCHANTS CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS

CARDS AND THAT ALL MERCHANTS HAVE NUMEROUS OPTIONS GIVEN THE

INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW AND TRADITIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT.

THEREFORE, WE DEDICATE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO DELIVERING

SUPERIOR AND DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR

MERCHANT CUSTOMERS.

THE LAWS OF A NUMBER OF STATES IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN

COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. PROHIBIT SURCHARGING CREDIT CARD

PURCHASES. AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS

WITH MERCHANTS GENERALLY DO NOT PROHIBIT SURCHARGING SO LONG AS

IT IS PERMITTED BY LAW AND A MERCHANT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE

AGAINST THE CARD BY SURCHARGING HIGHER AMOUNTS ON PURCHASES WITH

THE CARD THAN ON PURCHASES WITH OTHER CARDS, OR BY IMPOSING A

SURCHARGE ONLY ON CARD PURCHASES, BUT NOT ON PURCHASES MADE WITH

OTHER CARDS. AMERICAN EXPRESS ALSO DOES NOT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS

FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY WITH CASH, CHECK OR

AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE (I.E., INTER-BANK TRANSFERS OR

ACH). IN ADDITION, AMERICAN EXPRESS DOES NOT

PROHIBIT U.S. MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR IN-KIND

INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK, WHICH WAS

ENACTED IN JULY 2010. FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PROCEEDING

AGAINST US RECENTLY BROUGHT BY THE DOJ AND CERTAIN STATE

LAWS WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR MERCHANT

AGREEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR CARDMEMBERS AND OUR

BRAND AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AT THE POINT OF SALE, PLEASE SEE

PROCEEDINGS BEGINNING ON PAGE 91.

GMS IS FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING FACTORS THAT

INFLUENCE MERCHANT SATISFACTION, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND

EXECUTING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT

MERCHANTS, USING TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES, ENHANCING OPERATIONAL

EFFICIENCIES AND MERCHANTS EASE OF DOING BUSINESS WITH US,

PROVIDING A SUITE OF ONLINE SERVICING TOOLS, MAKING OUR UNITED

STATES OPERATING PROCEDURES EASILY AVAILABLE TO MERCHANTS ON OUR

WEB SITE, APPLYING OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITIES AND DEEP

MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH

MERCHANTS THROUGH AN EXPANDING ROSTER OF SERVICES THAT HELPS

THEM MEET THEIR BUSINESS GOALS.

WE ALSO OFFER OUR MERCHANT CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE OF

POINT-OF-SALE

SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATED

POINT-OF-SALE

TERMINALS, SOFTWARE, ONLINE SOLUTIONS, AND DIRECT LINKS THAT

ALLOW MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS (AS WELL AS

CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON OTHER NETWORKS AND CHECKS).

VIRTUALLY ALL PROPRIETARY

POINT-OF-SALE

SOLUTIONS SUPPORT DIRECT PROCESSING (I.E., DIRECT CONNECTIVITY)

TO AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH CAN LOWER A MERCHANTS COST OF

CARD ACCEPTANCE AND ENHANCE PAYMENT EFFICIENCY.

IN NOVEMBER 2010, WE ACQUIRED ACCERTIFY INC., A LEADING PROVIDER

OF SOLUTIONS THAT HELP MERCHANTS COMBAT FRAUDULENT ONLINE AND

OTHER CARD-NOT-PRESENT TRANSACTIONS. LAUNCHED IN 2007, ACCERTIFY

PROVIDES A HOSTED SOFTWARE APPLICATION THAT OFFERS AN EXTRA

LEVEL OF SECURITY FOR TRANSACTIONS OVER ANY OF THE MAJOR PAYMENT

NETWORKS, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DISCOVER

AND PAYPAL, OR ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHOD. ACCERTIFY

ALSO OFFERS MERCHANTS THE OPTION TO OUTSOURCE THEIR

END-TO-END

FRAUD MANAGEMENT PROCESS. WITH THE ACQUISITION OF ACCERTIFY,

AMERICAN EXPRESS IS ABLE TO BROADEN ITS FRAUD PREVENTION

SERVICES TO MERCHANTS FOR TRANSACTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE ON ALL

NETWORKS. ACCERTIFYS CAPABILITIES ARE INCREMENTAL AND

COMPLEMENTARY TO AMERICAN EXPRESS FRAUD SOLUTIONS ALREADY

OFFERED TO MERCHANTS FOR TRANSACTIONS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

INTEROPERABILITY IN PAYMENT CARD SPECIFICATIONS, MAKING IT

EASIER FOR MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT OUR CARDS, FOR CARDMEMBERS TO

HAVE A MORE SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE AT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE POINT OF SALE, AND FOR ISSUERS WHO HAVE MORE THAN ONE

NETWORK RELATIONSHIP TO HAVE A STANDARD ACROSS THEIR CARD

PRODUCTS.

WE ARE AN OWNER-MEMBER OF EMVCO, THE STANDARDS BODY THAT

MANAGES, MAINTAINS, AND ENHANCES SPECIFICATIONS FOR CHIP-BASED

PAYMENT CARDS AND ACCEPTANCE DEVICES, INCLUDING

POINT-OF-SALE

TERMINALS. OUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS COMPANY HELPS TO DRIVE

SECURE AND INTEROPERABLE PAYMENTS GLOBALLY FOR TRANSACTIONS MADE

WITH CHIP CARDS BY ALIGNING AND PROGRESSING THE EMV

SPECIFICATIONS. FURTHER, AS EMVCOS SCOPE EXPANDS TO

INCLUDE EMERGING PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CONTACTLESS CARDS

AND MOBILE PHONES, OUR PARTICIPATION WILL FACILITATE OUR

PRODUCTS AND SPECIFICATIONS BEING UNIVERSALLY COMPATIBLE AND

READY FOR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN AREAS THAT MAKE USE AND

ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD MORE CONVENIENT FOR MERCHANTS AND

CARDMEMBERS. FOR INSTANCE, AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFERS A CONTACTLESS

PAYMENT FEATURE EMBEDDED IN CERTAIN CARDS, TO PROVIDE A FAST,

EASY-TO-USE ALTERNATIVE TO CASH, CHECK, DEBIT OR OTHER PAYMENT

FORMS, PARTICULARLY FOR MAKING EVERYDAY PURCHASES AT MERCHANTS

WHERE SPEED AND CONVENIENCE IS IMPORTANT. IN THE U.S., TOP

QUICK-SERVICE RESTAURANTS, MOVIE THEATERS, DRUG AND CONVENIENCE

STORES AND MAJOR RETAIL CHAINS READILY ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS

CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS. SIMILARLY, AUTOMATIC BILL PAYMENT FOCUSES

ON PROVIDING CONVENIENCE BY ALLOWING MERCHANTS TO BILL

CARDMEMBERS ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR RECURRING CHARGES APPROVED BY

THE CARDMEMBER SUCH AS INSURANCE PREMIUMS, NEWSPAPER

SUBSCRIPTIONS, HEALTH CLUB MEMBERSHIPS, COMMUTATION COSTS AND

TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, TO PROVIDE EXTRA

CONVENIENCE AND SPEED AT THE POINT OF SALE, LOW VALUE

TRANSACTIONS (UNDER $25 IN THE U.S.) DO NOT REQUIRE A SIGNATURE.

WHEREVER WE MANAGE BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH

MERCHANTS AND THE CARD-ISSUING SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A

CLOSED-LOOP, WHICH DISTINGUISHES OUR NETWORK FROM

THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, IN THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT

BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD TRANSACTION. WE MAINTAIN DIRECT

RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH OUR CARDMEMBERS AND OUR MERCHANTS, AND

WE HANDLE ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.

OUR RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW US TO ANALYZE INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER

SPENDING. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING AND

OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS AND

SERVICES TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS. RECENTLY,

WE CREATED A BUSINESS WITHIN GMS CALLED AMERICAN

EXPRESS

®

BUSINESS INSIGHTS, WHICH OFFERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DERIVED

FROM OUR STRONG BUSINESS MODEL AND CLOSED LOOP NETWORK. BUSINESS

INSIGHTS COMBINES AGGREGATED, NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA

AND TREND ANALYSIS TO PROVIDE SPECIALIZED BUSINESS PLANNING AND

MARKETING EXPERTISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE

PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER

SPENDING, AND COMPLY WITH OUR PRIVACY AND FIREWALL POLICIES AND

APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING

BANK PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS CLOSED-LOOP,

WHICH PERMITS THEM TO CUSTOMIZE MARKETING EFFORTS, DELIVER

GREATER VALUE TO THEIR CARDMEMBERS AND HELP US TO DIRECT

INCREASED BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT THE CARD.

AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WE HAVE CERTAIN EXPOSURES THAT ARISE

IF A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS

SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE CARDMEMBER. DRIVERS OF THIS LIABILITY

ARE RETURNS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER

FRAUDULENT CHARGES, THE QUALITY OR NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND

SERVICES AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, WE OFFSET THE AMOUNT DUE

TO THE CARDMEMBER AGAINST PAYMENTS FOR THE MERCHANTS

CURRENT OR FUTURE CHARGE SUBMISSIONS. WE CAN REALIZE LOSSES WHEN

A MERCHANTS OFFSETTING CHARGE SUBMISSIONS CEASE, SUCH AS

WHEN THE MERCHANT DECIDES TO NO LONGER ACCEPT THE CARD,

COMMENCES A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE

ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE RISK OF THIS

EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE

NET EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN MERCHANT BY HOLDING CASH RESERVES FUNDED

THROUGH CHARGE PAYABLE HOLDBACKS FROM A MERCHANT, LENGTHENING

THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE MERCHANT SUBMITS A CHARGE FOR PAYMENT

AND WHEN WE PAY THE MERCHANT REQUIRING THE MERCHANT TO SECURE A

LETTER OF CREDIT OR A PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE, OR IMPLEMENTING

OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS. WE ALSO ESTABLISH

RESERVES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES IN

ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING RULES.

WITH THE INCREASE IN ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF PAYMENT CARD

TRANSACTION DATA OVER MERCHANTS

POINT-OF-SALE

SYSTEMS, AMERICAN EXPRESS AND OTHER CARD NETWORKS RECOGNIZED THE

NECESSITY FOR MERCHANTS AND MERCHANT PROCESSORS TO SECURE THIS

DATA AGAINST ACCIDENTAL OR INTENTIONAL COMPROMISE USING A

STANDARD PROTOCOL THAT APPLIES TO ALL CARD TYPES. WE AND

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, JCB CO., LTD., MASTERCARD WORLDWIDE

SSCS ROLE IS TO MANAGE THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY

(PCI) DATA SECURITY STANDARD, AND MORE RECENTLY THE

PCI PIN ENTRY DEVICE (PED) SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AND

THE PAYMENT APPLICATION DATA SECURITY STANDARD, WHICH FOCUS ON

IMPROVING PAYMENT CARD ACCOUNT SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE

TRANSACTION PROCESS. BY ESTABLISHING PCI SSC, WE AND THE OTHER

FOUNDERS HAVE DEVELOPED COMMON STANDARDS THAT ARE MORE

ACCESSIBLE AND EFFICIENT FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE PAYMENT CARD

INDUSTRY. ALL OUR MERCHANTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT STORE,

PROCESS AND TRANSMIT PAYMENT CARD DATA ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY

WITH THE PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD. PCI SSC IS DEDICATED TO

DRIVING GREATER EDUCATION, AWARENESS AND ADOPTION OF THESE

SECURITY STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN

THE PAYMENT PROCESS CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY.

IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA,

THIRD-PARTY PROCESSORS AND SOME BANKCARD ACQUIRERS OFFER

MERCHANTS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVERTING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS

FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF THE CARDHOLDERS

RESIDENCE (I.E., THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE,

AND SUBMITTING THE TRANSACTION IN THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING

CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY

CONVERSION PROCESS OF THE CARD NETWORK. THIS PRACTICE IS KNOWN

AS DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION. IF A MERCHANT

UTILIZES A DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS, THE MERCHANT AND

PROCESSOR SHARE ANY FEE ASSESSED OR SPREAD EARNED FOR CONVERTING

THE TRANSACTION AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE,

THUS REDUCING OR ELIMINATING REVENUE FOR CARD ISSUERS AND CARD

NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CHARGES TO THE

CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY. THIS PRACTICE IS STILL NOT

WIDESPREAD, AND IT REMAINS UNCERTAIN WHETHER ITS USE WILL EXPAND

OVER TIME. OUR POLICY GENERALLY REQUIRES MERCHANTS TO SUBMIT

CHARGES AND BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE

TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND WE CONVERT THE TRANSACTION TO THE

CARDMEMBERS BILLING CURRENCY.

OUR GLOBAL CARD NETWORK, INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES

AND GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESSES, COMPETES IN THE GLOBAL

PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WITH OTHER CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB INTERNATIONAL (WHICH WAS

ACQUIRED BY DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES), AND DISCOVER

NETWORK SERVICES, A RANGE OF COMPANIES GLOBALLY, INCLUDING

MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND PROCESSORS, CARRY OUT SOME ACTIVITIES

SIMILAR TO THOSE PERFORMED BY OUR GMS AND GNS BUSINESSES. NO

SINGLE ENTITY PARTICIPATES ON A GLOBAL BASIS IN THE FULL RANGE

OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ENCOMPASSED BY OUR CLOSED-LOOP BUSINESS

MODEL.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK AND

MERCHANT SERVICE BUSINESSES INCLUDE.



THE NUMBER OF

CARDS-IN-FORCE

AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THESE CARDS



THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THE CARDS

CAN BE USED



THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANTS OF

PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK



THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS



REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION



INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT IN SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCT AND

SERVICE OFFERINGS, PARTICULARLY IN ON-LINE COMMERCE



THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE



THE SECURITY OF CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT INFORMATION



THE IMPACT OF EXISTING LITIGATION, LEGISLATION AND GOVERNMENT

REGULATION



THE COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE RELATIVE TO THE VALUE PROVIDED.

ANOTHER ASPECT OF NETWORK COMPETITION IS THE RECENT EMERGENCE

AND RAPID GROWTH OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS,

WHICH INCLUDE AGGREGATORS (SUCH AS PAYPAL), WIRELESS PAYMENT

TECHNOLOGIES

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT

TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT

CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY PROVIDED BY

SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WITH

SOCIAL NETWORKING, ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT

WITH EACH OTHER AND TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IN

THIS CONNECTION, TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS

SUCH AS MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ARE WORKING TO

DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS

AND MERCHANTS. WHILE WE ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE THE LARGEST SHARE

OF ONLINE SPENDING OF ANY MAJOR CARD ISSUER AND MORE GLOBAL

ONLINE BILLINGS VOLUME THAN PAYPAL, THE COMPETITION REMAINS

FIERCE FOR CAPTURING ONLINE SPEND IN THE EVER-INCREASING DIGITAL

WORLD.

TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, SUCH

AS AGGREGATORS, CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND, DISCOUNT

REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR

CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, AND POTENTIALLY OTHER REVENUES COULD BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS

BASED ON ACH CONTINUE TO EMERGE AND GROW, AND EXISTING DEBIT

NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND BOTH ON- AND OFF-LINE AND ARE

MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD

FURTHER REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS

ONLINE. FOR A DISCUSSION CONCERNING OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE

EMERGING PAYMENTS AREA, PLEASE SEE ENTERPRISE GROWTH

BEGINNING ON PAGE 34 BELOW.

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE OUR

CLOSED-LOOP FUNCTIONALITY, SUCH AS VISA, WITH ITS VISA INCENTIVE

NETWORK. ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE VISA WILL

BE, EFFORTS BY VISA AND OTHER CARD NETWORKS AND PAYMENT

PROVIDERS TO REPLICATE THE CLOSED-LOOP SPEAK TO ITS CONTINUED

VALUE AND TO THE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE

OPERATE.

GLOBAL

NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES 

REGULATION

LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING GNS

ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY

AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CARDS AND, IN THE CASE OF

OUR IO ARRANGEMENTS, TO OPERATE MERCHANT-ACQUIRING BUSINESSES.

ACCORDINGLY, OUR GNS PARTNERS HAVE GENERALLY NOT HAD DIFFICULTY

OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE COUNTRIES

IN WHICH WE HAVE CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO GNS ARRANGEMENTS. AS A

SERVICE PROVIDER TO REGULATED U.S. BANKS, OUR GNS BUSINESS

IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CERTAIN FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS,

INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION (FDIC), THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF

THE CURRENCY (OCC) AND THE OFFICE OF THRIFT

SUPERVISION (OTS).

AS THE OPERATOR OF A GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, WE ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENCY AND FOREIGN

TRANSACTIONS REPORTING ACT AND THE ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS

ISSUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (COLLECTIVELY

REFERRED TO AS THE BANK SECRECY ACT), AS AMENDED BY

THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE PATRIOT ACT). WE

CONDUCT DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR GNS PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY

HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

(AML) CONTROLS TO PREVENT OUR NETWORK FROM BEING

USED FOR MONEY LAUNDERING OR TERRORIST FINANCING PURPOSES. AS A

RESULT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BEING BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FURTHER

REGULATION AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR REGULATORY STATUS, PLEASE SEE

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  GENERAL

BEGINNING ON PAGE 38 BELOW.

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION

OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD

ISSUERS AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS.

REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND,

ITALY, SWITZERLAND, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA,

BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED

INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING, CONCLUDED, OR ON APPEAL.

THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY

THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN

FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND

MASTERCARD, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT

SERVICE CHARGE PAYABLE BY MERCHANTS FOR BANKCARD DEBIT AND

CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE

INTERCHANGE FEES. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS

PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD

NETWORKS AND THEIR OPERATIONS ON A MULTILATERAL BASIS, ANTITRUST

ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING TO MERCHANT PRICING

COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE

AND/OR

MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR

OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE FROM CONSUMERS SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL

CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY

SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, CONGRESS CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON THE

INTERCHANGE ISSUE DURING 2010. CONGRESS PASSED DODD-FRANK, WHICH

THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW IN JULY 2010. DODD-FRANK GIVES THE

FEDERAL RESERVE THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH RULES REGARDING

INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED BY PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A PERSON USES A DEBIT OR GENERAL-USE

PREPAID CARD, AND TO ENFORCE A NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT

SUCH FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE ACTUAL COST OF A

TRANSACTION TO THE ISSUER, WITH SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR THE

COSTS OF FRAUD PREVENTION, AS WELL AS TO PROHIBIT EXCLUSIVE

NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS DOES NOT OFFER A DEBIT CARD LINKED TO A DEPOSIT

ACCOUNT, BUT DOES ISSUE VARIOUS TYPES OF PREPAID CARDS.

RELOADABLE GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS, BUT NOT THOSE MARKETED OR

LABELED AS GIFT CARDS OR GIFT CERTIFICATES, ARE EXEMPT FROM THE

INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO THE INTERCHANGE FEE

LIMITATIONS, ALL PREPAID CARDS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE

NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED A NOTICE OF

PROPOSED RULEMAKING REQUESTING COMMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE

INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING

RESTRICTIONS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS PROPOSED TWO OPTIONS FOR

THE INTERCHANGE LIMITATIONS AND DESCRIBES TWO INTERPRETATIONS OF

THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE ON THE EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING

RESTRICTIONS. COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL WERE DUE BY

FEBRUARY 22, 2011. THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST ISSUE FINAL

RULES ON THE INTERCHANGE LIMITATIONS BY APRIL 2011, AND THOSE

RULES TAKE EFFECT ON JULY 21, 2011. THE FEDERAL RESERVE

MUST ISSUE FINAL RULES ON THE EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING

RESTRICTIONS BY JULY 21, 2011. THE STATUTE DOES NOT SPECIFY

WHEN THOSE RULES MUST TAKE EFFECT. THE PROPOSED RULES ISSUED BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAVE GARNERED ATTENTION FROM MEMBERS OF

CONGRESS, AND THE RELEVANT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES HAVE HELD

HEARINGS TO REVIEW THE PROPOSAL. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AT

THIS TIME THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FINAL REGULATIONS, ONCE

ISSUED, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM

RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO

ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH

AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFERS

DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER.

FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE

STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL

PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY

DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO

ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR

CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT

DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED

TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED

THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A

RESULT OF THESE NEW LAWS, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY

MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD

PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT, SUCH AS DEBIT, WHICH COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. DURING THE LAST

FOUR YEARS, A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED IN INDIVIDUAL STATE

LEGISLATURES SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE

FEES OR TO PROHIBIT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FROM CHARGING A

MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE SALES TAX PORTION OF CREDIT CARD

PURCHASES. OTHER PROPOSALS WERE AIMED AT INCREASING THE

TRANSPARENCY OF CARD NETWORK RULES FOR MERCHANTS. IN ADDITION, A

NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH MERCHANT LIABILITY

FOR THE COSTS OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH OF A MERCHANTS

SYSTEM OR REQUIRE MERCHANTS TO ADOPT TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS TO

PROTECT SENSITIVE CARDHOLDER PAYMENT INFORMATION. IN 2010,

VERMONT ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SET A

MINIMUM DOLLAR VALUE OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ANY

FORM OF PAYMENT; PERMITS MERCHANTS TO PROVIDE DISCOUNTS OR OTHER

BENEFITS BASED ON THE FORM OF PAYMENT (I.E., CARD, CASH, CHECK,

DEBIT CARD, STORED-VALUE CARD, CHARGE CARD OR CREDIT CARD); AND

PERMITS MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT THE CARDS OF A PAYMENT SYSTEM AT ONE

OR MORE OF ITS LOCATIONS BUT NOT AT OTHERS. THIS LEGISLATION MAY

SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER STATES. IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL

LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE OR

MERCHANT FEES CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OR STATE DATA SECURITY

LEGISLATION IS ADOPTED, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE ANTITRUST ACTIONS OR REGULATIONS HAVE

LED OUR COMPETITORS TO LOWER THEIR FEES, WE HAVE MADE

ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRICING TO MERCHANTS TO REFLECT LOCAL

COMPETITIVE TRENDS. FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCTIONS IN BANKCARD

INTERCHANGE MANDATED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA IN 2003

RESULTED IN LOWER MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR VISA AND

MASTERCARD ACCEPTANCE. AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE

MARKETPLACE, WE REDUCED OUR OWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES IN

AUSTRALIA OVER TIME, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE

BILLED BUSINESS AND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING OUR CARDS.

IN ADDITION, UNDER LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ARGENTINA, A MERCHANT

ACQUIRER IS REQUIRED TO CHARGE THE SAME MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE

TO ALL MERCHANTS IN THE SAME INDUSTRY CATEGORY, AND MERCHANT

DISCOUNT RATES FOR CREDIT CARDS CANNOT EXCEED 3%. THE CENTRAL

BANK OF VENEZUELA HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS REGARDING THE MAXIMUM

LEVEL OF MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES BY INDUSTRY CATEGORY. IN

DECEMBER 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RULED THAT

MASTERCARDS MULTILATERAL INTERCHANGE FEES

(MIF) FOR CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTIONS

VIOLATE EC TREATY RULES ON RESTRICTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. THE

COMMISSIONS DECISION APPLIES TO CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER

CREDIT, CHARGE AND DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE EU AND TO

DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH MASTERCARD HAS CHOSEN TO APPLY

THE CROSS-BORDER MIF. THE RULING DOES NOT PREVENT MASTERCARD AND

ITS MEMBER BANKS FROM ADOPTING AN ALTERNATIVE MIF ARRANGEMENT

THAT CAN BE PROVEN TO COMPLY WITH EU COMPETITION RULES. ALTHOUGH

THE COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION INCLUDED COMMERCIAL CARDS,

IT HAS RESERVED JUDGMENT FOR THE TIME BEING ON THE LEGALITY OF

MASTERCARDS CROSS-BORDER MIF FOR COMMERCIAL CARD

TRANSACTIONS. MASTERCARD LODGED AN APPEAL AGAINST THE

COMMISSIONS FINDINGS, WHICH IS PENDING. AN INTERIM

SETTLEMENT, PENDING THE APPEAL, WAS AGREED TO IN 2009 BETWEEN

THE COMMISSION AND MASTERCARD, CAPPING MIF AT 30 BASIS

POINTS FOR CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS AND 20 BASIS POINTS

FOR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS.

IN 2002, THE COMMISSION GRANTED AN EXEMPTION TO VISA REGARDING

ITS MIFS FOR CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS WITHIN

EUROPE. THIS EXEMPTION EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND IN

MARCH 2008 THE COMMISSION OPENED FORMAL ANTITRUST PROCEEDINGS

AGAINST VISA EUROPE LIMITED IN RELATION TO VISAS MIFS FOR

SUCH TRANSACTIONS. THE COMMISSION INDICATED THAT THE MASTERCARD

DECISION SHOULD PROVIDE VISA WITH GUIDANCE FOR THE WAY

AHEAD, ALTHOUGH IT STATED THAT EVERY MIF MUST BE

EXAMINED ON ITS OWN MERITS. IN 2010, THE COMMISSION

ACCEPTED VISA EUROPES PLEDGE TO CUT ITS CROSS-BORDER DEBIT

CARD MIF TO 20 BASIS POINTS FOR FOUR YEARS. THE

COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION INTO VISA EUROPES CREDIT

AND DEFERRED DEBIT CARD MIF FOR CROSS-BORDER TRANSACTIONS

REMAINS ONGOING.

DEVELOPMENTS AT THE EU LEVEL MAY AFFECT HOW THE COMPETITION

AUTHORITIES IN THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EU VIEW DOMESTIC

INTERCHANGE AND THE PROGRESS OF ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS. IN 2007,

FOR EXAMPLE, CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMISSIONS FINDINGS OF

THAT YEAR IN ITS CASE AGAINST MASTERCARD, THE COMPETITION

REGULATOR IN POLAND FOUND INSUFFICIENT BASIS FOR VISA AND

MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE FEES AND ORDERED THE ASSOCIATIONS AND

THEIR MEMBERS TO STOP THEIR CURRENT INTERCHANGE SETTING

PRACTICES. HOWEVER, THE BANKS APPEALED THAT DECISION, AND IN

NOVEMBER 2008 THE DECISION WAS OVERTURNED. THE POLISH

COMPETITION AUTHORITY HAS APPEALED THAT RULING. MORE RECENTLY,

THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM INDICATED THAT

IT WAS DELAYING FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF ITS CASES AGAINST

MASTERCARD AND VISA PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE APPEAL OF THE

EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS DECISION AGAINST MASTERCARD.

IN 2010, NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN HUNGARY AND FRANCE ENACTED

LEGISLATION TO CAP INTERCHANGE FEES OR POINT OF SALE SERVICE

CHARGES WITHOUT GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP FOR THESE MEASURES.

ALTHOUGH IN BOTH CASES THE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN EITHER REPEALED

OR STRUCK DOWN ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS, IT IS POSSIBLE THERE MAY

BE FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO ENACT REGULATION OF MERCHANT FEES OR

INTERCHANGE WITH DIRECT OR INDIRECT IMPACTS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS.

IN AUGUST 2009, VISA AND MASTERCARD SETTLED AN ANTI-TRUST CASE

WITH THE NEW ZEALAND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES REGARDING WHETHER

THE SETTING OF INTERCHANGE RATES CONSTITUTED PRICE FIXING AND

WHETHER OTHER SCHEME RULES LESSENED COMPETITION. THE SETTLEMENT

RESULTS IN CHANGES TO THE VISA AND MASTERCARD SCHEME RULES,

WHICH WILL SET MAXIMUM INTERCHANGE RATES AND ALSO ALLOW

BILATERAL SETTING OF LOWER INTERCHANGE RATES BETWEEN ISSUERS AND

ACQUIRERS, AS WELL AS REMOVE THE SCHEMES NO SURCHARGING

RULES. ON APRIL 17, 2010, EACH OF THE SCHEMES RELEASED

THEIR MAXIMUM INTERCHANGE RATES. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AT

THIS TIME THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CHANGES TO INTERCHANGE COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY IN NEW ZEALAND.

REGULATORS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED NETWORK RULES THAT PROHIBIT

MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING CARD PURCHASES. IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE

SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON OUR

CARDS IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED

TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS. THE MEMBER STATES OF

THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA HAVE NOW IMPLEMENTED A RELATIVELY NEW

LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING

CARDS, CALLED THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 2007/64/EC ON PAYMENT

SERVICES. THIS DIRECTIVE, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE PAYMENT

SERVICES DIRECTIVE, PRESCRIBES COMMON RULES FOR LICENSING AND

SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD

ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF

BUSINESS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PAYMENT SERVICES

DIRECTIVE IS TO FACILITATE THE OPERATION OF A SINGLE INTERNAL

PAYMENTS MARKET IN THE EU THROUGH HARMONIZATION OF EU MEMBER

STATE LAWS GOVERNING PAYMENT SERVICES. ONE PROVISION OF THE

PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE,

SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, BUT ALSO ALLOWS INDIVIDUAL

MEMBER STATES TO OVERRIDE THIS RULE BY PROHIBITING OR LIMITING

SURCHARGING. TO DATE, THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC

AREA ARE SPLIT ON WHETHER THEY PROHIBIT OR PERMIT SURCHARGING,

WITH COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM (WHICH FOR A NUMBER OF

YEARS HAS PERMITTED IT FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES), THE

NETHERLANDS AND SPAIN PERMITTING IT, IN SOME CASES WITHIN

LIMITS, AND OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS FRANCE, ITALY AND SWEDEN

PROHIBITING IT. ALL MEMBER STATES PERMIT DISCOUNTS. THE PAYMENT

SERVICES DIRECTIVE COMPLEMENTS ANOTHER EUROPEAN INITIATIVE, THE

SINGLE EURO PAYMENTS AREA (SEPA), WHICH IS AN

INDUSTRY-LED INITIATIVE WITH SUPPORT FROM EU INSTITUTIONS. AMONG

OTHER CHANGES, SEPA INVOLVES THE ADOPTION OF NEW, PAN-EUROPEAN

TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR CARDS AND CARD TRANSACTIONS. ALL OF THE

FOREGOING REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN.

THE CANADIAN COMPETITION BUREAU HAS COMMENCED AN APPLICATION

AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD UNDER THE PRICE MAINTENANCE

PROVISIONS OF THE CANADIAN COMPETITION ACT SEEKING A REMEDIAL

ORDER PROHIBITING VISA AND MASTERCARD FROM ENTERING INTO,

ENFORCING OR IMPOSING TERMS THAT RESTRAIN MERCHANTS FROM CERTAIN

BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING ENCOURAGING USE OF LOWER COST

METHODS OF PAYMENT AND DISCOURAGING USE OF CREDIT CARDS WITH

HIGHER CARD ACCEPTANCE FEES, DECLINING ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN

CREDIT CARDS AND SURCHARGING CUSTOMERS WHO USE VISA AND

MASTERCARD CREDIT CARDS. WHILE THE COMPETITION BUREAU DID NOT

NAME AMERICAN EXPRESS IN ITS APPLICATION, THIS ACTION EVIDENCES

THE STRONG REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL FOCUS ON THIS AREA, WHICH

COULD HAVE INDIRECT IMPLICATIONS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS.

THE CANADIAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REQUIRES AMEX BANK OF CANADA

AS WELL AS OTHER PAYMENT NETWORKS, ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS TO

ADHERE TO THE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD

INDUSTRY IN CANADA WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS REQUIRES INCREASED

TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE OF FEES IN MERCHANT AGREEMENTS AND

MONTHLY STATEMENTS, REQUIRES 90 DAYS NOTICE OF MERCHANT FEE

INCREASES OR INTRODUCTION OF NEW FEES AND GIVES MERCHANTS THE

RIGHT TO CANCEL THEIR CONTRACT WITHOUT PENALTY AFTER RECEIVING

SUCH NOTICE, ALLOWS DIFFERENTIAL DISCOUNTING BY MERCHANTS

BETWEEN FORMS OF PAYMENT AND PAYMENT NETWORKS AND REQUIRES THAT

MERCHANTS PROVIDE THEIR EXPRESS CONSENT TO ACCEPT NEW PRODUCTS

OR SERVICES.

CHARGE

CARDS

OUR CHARGE CARDS, WHICH GENERALLY CARRY NO PRESET SPENDING

LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS

A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES. CHARGES ARE

APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A

CARDMEMBERS CURRENT SPENDING PATTERNS, PAYMENT HISTORY,

CREDIT RECORD, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. CARDMEMBERS GENERALLY

MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH, AND NO FINANCE

CHARGES ARE ASSESSED ON THE BALANCE. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT

ARE PAST DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY

ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE

CANCELLED. THE NO PRESET-SPENDING LIMIT AND

PAY-IN-FULL

NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS ATTRACT HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS.

THE CHARGE CARDS ALSO OFFER SEVERAL WAYS FOR ELIGIBLE U.S.

CARDMEMBERS TO PAY OFF CERTAIN OF THEIR PURCHASES OVER TIME. THE

SIGN &

TRAVEL

®

FEATURE PERMITS ELIGIBLE U.S. CARDMEMBERS TO EXTEND PAYMENT

FOR AIRLINE TICKETS, CRUISE SHIP TICKETS AND OTHER TRAVEL

CHARGES PURCHASED WITH OUR CHARGE CARDS. THE EXTENDED PAYMENT

OPTION PERMITS ELIGIBLE U.S. CARDMEMBERS TO EXTEND PAYMENT

FOR ELIGIBLE CHARGES ABOVE A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT.

AS PART OF OUR EFFORT TO DELIVER ADDITIONAL VALUE FOR EXISTING

CARDMEMBERS AND TO ATTRACT NEW HIGH-SPENDING CUSTOMERS TO

CARDMEMBERS EARN REWARDS PROVIDED BY THE PARTNERS

RESPECTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR SPENDING ON THE

CO-BRAND CARDS, SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY

POINTS AND CASH BACK. WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR CO-BRAND PARTNERS,

WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF

CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH

SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF

ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. WE EXPENSE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER

CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MONTH EARNED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY

ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. GENERALLY, ONCE WE

MAKE PAYMENT TO THE CO-BRAND PARTNER, THE PARTNER IS SOLELY

LIABLE FOR PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE

CO-BRAND PARTNERS OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM. AS THE ISSUER OF

THE CO-BRAND CARD, WE RETAIN ALL THE CREDIT RISK WITH THE

CARDMEMBER AND BEAR THE RECEIVABLES FUNDING AND OPERATING

EXPENSES FOR SUCH CARDS. THE CO-BRAND PARTNER RETAINS THE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH THE MILES, POINTS OR OTHER CURRENCY EARNED BY

THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE PARTNERS LOYALTY PROGRAM.

DURING 2010, WE INTRODUCED SEVERAL NEW INNOVATIONS TO OUR

EXISTING PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE LAUNCHED THE FIRST BAG FREE

BENEFIT WHICH ALLOWS GOLD, PLATINUM AND RESERVE DELTA SKYMILES

CREDIT CARD CARDMEMBERS TO CHECK THEIR FIRST BAG FOR FREE ON

DELTA AIR LINES OPERATED FLIGHTS. WE ALSO LAUNCHED TWO NEW

BENEFITS ON THE STARWOOD PREFERRED GUEST CREDIT CARD AND THE

STARWOOD PREFERRED GUEST BUSINESS CREDIT CARD THAT PROVIDES A 5

NIGHT / 2 STAY CREDIT SO CARDMEMBERS EARN ELITE STATUS

FASTER AND AN EXCLUSIVE SHERATON HOTELS AND RESORTS OFFER.

CO-BRAND

PARTNERSHIPS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS

WE ALSO ISSUE CARDS THAT ARE MARKETED UNDER CO-BRAND PARTNERSHIP

ARRANGEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNERS. SUCH PARTNERSHIPS

INVOLVE THE OFFERING OF A STANDARD PRODUCT (ISSUED BY TRS OR ONE

OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) TO CUSTOMERS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

PARTNER, GENERALLY CO-BRANDED WITH THE PARTNERS NAME ON

THE CARD. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE MAY MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE

NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED

AND/OR

RETAINED THROUGH THE ARRANGEMENT

AND/OR

THE

AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON SUCH CARDS. THE DURATION OF

SUCH ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.

CARD

PRICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

CERTAIN CARDS, PARTICULARLY CHARGE CARDS, CHARGE AN ANNUAL FEE

THAT VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD AND THE NUMBER OF CARDS

FOR EACH ACCOUNT. WE ALSO OFFER MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS WITH

NO ANNUAL FEE BUT ON WHICH WE ASSESS FINANCE CHARGES FOR

REVOLVING BALANCES. DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, WE ALSO CHARGE

20

CARDMEMBERS AN ANNUAL PROGRAM FEE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

REWARDS

PROGRAM

THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS ALLOWS

CARDMEMBERS TO EARN ONE POINT FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY DOLLAR CHARGED

ON ELIGIBLE, ENROLLED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND THEN REDEEM

POINTS FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF REWARDS, INCLUDING TRAVEL, RETAIL

MERCHANDISE, DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND

EVEN DONATIONS TO BENEFIT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHARITIES. POINTS

GENERALLY HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE

NUMBER OF POINTS ONE CAN EARN. A LARGE MAJORITY OF SPENDING BY

ELIGIBLE CARDMEMBERS EARNS POINTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

THE U.S. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM HAS OVER 150 REDEMPTION

PARTNERS AND FEATURES OVER 500 MERCHANDISE BRANDS. MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS ARE ALIGNED WITH SPECIFIC CARD PRODUCTS TO

BETTER MEET CARDMEMBER LIFESTYLE AND REWARD PROGRAM USAGE NEEDS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THREE

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS BASED ON THE CREDIT OR CHARGE

CARD THEY HAVE IN THEIR WALLET. FOR THOSE CARDMEMBERS WITH

AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND

DURING THE YEAR, WE ENHANCED OUR MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS

®

PROGRAM WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW REWARD OPTIONS DESIGNED TO

MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND AND PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS WITH GREATER

BREADTH AND VARIETY AS WELL AS UTILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE LAUNCHED

A NEW BENEFIT THAT ALLOWS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TO BE USED

FOR PURCHASES ON AMAZON.COM AT THE POINT OF SALE. IN ADDITION TO

THIS REDEMPTION OPTION AT AMAZON, WE HAVE ADDED A NUMBER OF NEW

PARTNERS TO THE PROGRAM THAT GIVE CARDMEMBERS A BROADER RANGE OF

OPPORTUNITIES TO REDEEM POINTS, SUCH AS UNIVERSAL STUDIOS THEME

PARKS, FOUR SEASONS HOTELS AND RESORTS, VICTORIAS SECRET,

RUBY TUESDAY AND ZYNGA. IN ADDITION, CARDMEMBERS NOW HAVE THE

ABILITY TO PAY FOR THEIR ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE WITH MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS POINTS. WE BELIEVE OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINT BANK IS

A SUBSTANTIAL ASSET AND A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, AND IS MOVING

TOWARDS BECOMING A VALUED VIRTUAL CURRENCY.

WHEN A CARDMEMBER ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM

USES THE CARD, WE ESTABLISH RESERVES TO COVER THE COST OF

ESTIMATED FUTURE REWARD REDEMPTIONS FOR POINTS EARNED TO DATE.

WHEN A MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ENROLLEE REDEEMS A REWARD

USING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS, WE MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM PARTNER PROVIDING THE REWARD PURSUANT

TO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE IS

DRIVEN BY CARDMEMBER CHARGE VOLUME, CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION IN

THE PROGRAM, AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH REDEMPTION

PARTNERS. AT YEAR END, WE ESTIMATED THAT CURRENT CARDMEMBERS

WILL ULTIMATELY REDEEM APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THEIR POINTS. FOR

MORE INFORMATION ON OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, SEE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  RESERVES FOR

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS COSTS APPEARING ON PAGE 25 OF OUR

2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF

CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND LOYALTY. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE, THAT CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS PROGRAMS YIELD

HIGHER SPEND, STRONGER CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND GREATER PROFIT FOR

US. BY OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES, WE

21

HAVE GIVEN OUR CARDMEMBERS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THEIR

CARDMEMBERS. OUR PROGRAM IS ALSO VALUABLE TO MERCHANTS THAT

BECOME REDEMPTION PARTNERS AS WE BRING THEM HIGH-SPENDING

CARDMEMBERS AND NEW MARKETING CHANNELS TO REACH THESE

CARD-ISSUING

BUSINESS  COMPETITION

OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INTENSE

COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. AS A CARD

ISSUER, WE COMPETE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIBANK, BANK OF AMERICA, JPMORGAN CHASE,

AND CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL) THAT ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND

REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS, AND DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHICH

ISSUES THE DISCOVER CARD ON THE DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES

NETWORK. WE ALSO ENCOUNTER COMPETITION FROM BUSINESSES THAT

ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR

CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH

THESE CARDS ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ONLY AT LIMITED LOCATIONS.

BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL

SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY

MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF

SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE

CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD

PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL

BRANCH NETWORKS.

IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED INCREASINGLY INTENSE

COMPETITION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR, AS COMPETITORS HAVE

TARGETED OPENS CUSTOMER BASE AND OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION

IN PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO

SMALL BUSINESSES. COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT CARDHOLDERS, INCLUDING PREMIUM

CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT, AIRLINE

FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS, CASH REBATES AND OTHER

REWARD OR REBATE PROGRAMS, SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS,

TEASER PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CREDIT

CARD ACQUISITION AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND CO-BRANDED

ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS.

MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS

ALSO ISSUE DEBIT CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR

FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR

POINT-OF-SALE

PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED

ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL-PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE

VISA OR MASTERCARD LOGO. AS A RESULT, THE PURCHASE VOLUME AND

NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE UNITED

STATES HAS GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD

TRANSACTIONS. DEBIT CARDS WERE MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH

AND CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS HAVE

TYPICALLY BEEN FOR SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS. THERE IS NO CREDIT

EXTENDED WHEN A DEBIT CARD IS USED AND THE CONSUMER MUST HAVE

SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN HIS OR HER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR

THE PURCHASE AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION AS OPPOSED TO CHARGE

CARDS WHERE PAYMENT IS DUE AT THE END OF THE BILLING PERIOD OR

CREDIT CARDS WHERE PAYMENT CAN BE EXTENDED OVER A PERIOD OF

TIME. HOWEVER, DEBIT CARDS ARE ALSO PERCEIVED AS AN ALTERNATIVE

TO CREDIT OR CHARGE CARDS AND USED IN THAT MANNER. WE DO NOT

OFFER A DEBIT CARD LINKED TO A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT, BUT WE DO ISSUE

VARIOUS TYPES OF PREPAID CARDS. AS THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY

CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE ARE ALSO FACING INCREASING COMPETITION

FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS, SUCH AS ONLINE NETWORKS, TELECOM

PROVIDERS, OR SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT LEVERAGE NEW

TECHNOLOGIES AND CUSTOMERS EXISTING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD

ACCOUNTS AND BANK RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT OR OTHER

FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EVOLUTION OF PAYMENT

PRODUCTS IN EMERGING MARKETS MAY

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BE DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPED MARKETS. INSTEAD OF

MIGRATING FROM CASH TO CHECKS TO PLASTIC, TECHNOLOGY AND

CONSUMER BEHAVIORS IN THESE MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE SKIPPING

OF ONE OR MORE STEPS TO ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS SUCH AS

MOBILE PAYMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE EVOLVING

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, PLEASE SEE

FINANCING

ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY MEETS ITS FINANCING NEEDS THROUGH A VARIETY OF

SOURCES, INCLUDING CASH OR ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE

INTO CASH, DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTED DEPOSITS,

UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS,

SECURITIZED BORROWINGS THROUGH A CONDUIT FACILITY AND LONG-TERM

COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITIES IN CERTAIN

NON-U.S. MARKETS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY

OF TRS, ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (CREDCO),

ACQUIRES OR FINANCES THE MAJORITY OF CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES

ARISING FROM THE USE OF CORPORATE CARDS ISSUED IN THE UNITED

STATES AND CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CARDS ISSUED IN CERTAIN

CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO FUNDS THE

ACQUISITION OR FINANCING OF RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE

SALE OF MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB

FINANCE THEIR REVOLVING CREDIT RECEIVABLES AND CONSUMER AND

SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES, IN PART, THROUGH THE

SALE OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND BY OFFERING CONSUMER DEPOSITS IN

THE UNITED STATES. TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ALSO FUND

RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS. THE COST OF

FUNDING CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR EXPENSE OF

CARD OPERATIONS.

(YOU CAN FIND A DISCUSSION OF OUR SECURITIZATION AND OTHER

FINANCING ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 41-44 UNDER THE CAPTION

DEPOSIT

PROGRAMS

OUR BANKING SUBSIDIARIES OFFER DEPOSITS TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGH

THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY

$29.7 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSUMER

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEPOSITS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING

U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAVE BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY

CHANNELS. AS PART OF ITS FUNDING STRATEGY, A MAJORITY OF THE

DEPOSITS RAISED DURING 2010 WERE SOURCED DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY

WITH CONSUMERS THROUGH PERSONAL SAVINGS FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS.

OUR DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES COMPETE WITH OTHER DEPOSIT-TAKING

ORGANIZATIONS THAT SOURCE DEPOSITS THROUGH TELEPHONE, INTERNET

AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DELIVERY CHANNELS, BROKERAGE NETWORKS,

AND/OR

THROUGH BRANCH LOCATIONS. WE COMPETE PRIMARILY IN THE DEPOSIT

SECTORS ON THE BASIS OF RATES AND OUR BRAND REPUTATION FOR

SAFETY AND SERVICE. WE SEEK TO OBTAIN THE DEPOSITS OF NEW

CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS EXISTING CARD CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING

ATTRACTIVE RATES AND MARKETING OUR NAME BRAND.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE

INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS ALSO IS DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS

OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT

(FDIA) GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING OUR

BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR

OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY

(DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS

(1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY

CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. A BANK THAT IS

LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST

RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL

RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE

BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA. AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL

OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN

GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION BY THE FDIC.

UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT SOLICIT

DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS

IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN THE MARKET

AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE

ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED

(PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE

PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO

CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN AN

UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND

BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL

CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN

ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN

RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND REQUIRE AN

UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE

TO SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS, ALL OF WHICH

WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT ITS ABILITY TO ACCEPT BROKERED DEPOSITS.

ENGAGING IN UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES.

CERTAIN FEDERAL PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE

COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS (SEE CORPORATE & OTHER

BELOW). FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT

COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES, THE

EUROPEAN UNION, AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE

HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION AND DISCLOSURE AND

PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN THE

LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES). BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS

AFFECT US TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS RESULT IN AMOUNTS OWED

BEING CLASSIFIED AS DELINQUENT

AND/OR

CHARGED OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE. AS STATED ABOVE, CARD ISSUERS AND

CARD NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK

SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION THAT

IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION  GENERAL WITHIN

CORPORATE & OTHER BELOW.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING IN

PARTICULAR CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB AND OUR OTHER BANK ENTITIES,

ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR

IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THEREOF

COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THE

COSTS OF COMPLIANCE. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR

CARD AND LENDING BUSINESSES OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX AND ROBUST, AND FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008,

SUPERVISORY EFFORTS TO APPLY RELEVANT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND

POLICIES HAVE BECOME MORE INTENSE. THE U.S. CONGRESS AND

REGULATORS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS, HAVE

CONTINUED TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON CERTAIN PRACTICES OF

CREDIT CARD ISSUERS, SUCH AS UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE BUSINESS

PRACTICES, INCREASES IN ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES

(APRS), CHANGES IN THE TERMS OF THE ACCOUNT, AND THE

TYPES AND LEVELS OF FEES AND FINANCIAL CHARGES CHARGED BY CARD

ISSUERS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LATE PAYMENTS, RETURNED CHECKS,

PAYMENTS BY TELEPHONE, COPIES OF STATEMENTS AND THE LIKE. IN

AUGUST 2010, AEBFSB ENTERED INTO A PUBLIC, WRITTEN SUPERVISORY

AGREEMENT WITH THE OTS, ITS PRIMARY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR,

REQUIRING AEBFSB TO MAKE CERTAIN ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS COMPLIANCE

PROGRAM AND TO COMPLETE CERTAIN CORRECTIVE ACTIONS RELATING TO

COMPLIANCE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REFINE OUR

BUSINESS PRACTICES IN LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED

DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS SO WE CAN

CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND CONSISTENT WITH

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT

THE RECENTLY ENACTED CARD ACT, PLEASE SEE PRIVACY, FAIR

CREDIT REPORTING WITHIN SUPERVISION AND

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION

COUNCIL (THE FFIEC), AN INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF

THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE TO THE

INDUSTRY ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE

PRACTICES (THE GUIDANCE). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE

AREAS: (I) CREDIT LINE MANAGEMENT; (II) OVER-LIMIT

PRACTICES; (III) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION

PRACTICES; (IV) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES; AND

(V) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE

PRACTICES. THE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL

INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FEDERAL BANK

REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT COMPRISE THE FFIEC, ALTHOUGH IT IS

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE IDENTIFICATION BY BANK REGULATORS IN

THEIR EXAMINATIONS OF OTHER CREDIT CARD LENDERS PRACTICES

DEEMED BY THEM TO BE INAPPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY, BUT NOT

EXCLUSIVELY, WITH REGARD TO SUBPRIME LENDING PROGRAMS. AT

PRESENT, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY LENDING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE

SUBPRIME SECTOR. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB EVALUATE AND DISCUSS

THE GUIDANCE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS ON AN ONGOING

BASIS AS PART OF THEIR REGULATORY EXAMINATION PROCESSES, AND, AS

A RESULT, MAY REFINE THEIR PRACTICES FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON

REGULATORY INPUT. THE GUIDANCE HAS NOT HAD, NOR DO WE EXPECT IT

TO HAVE, ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES.

INTERNATIONAL

CARD SERVICES

WE ISSUE OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN NUMEROUS COUNTRIES

AROUND THE GLOBE. OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IS WIDESPREAD AND WE

FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THOSE COUNTRIES THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER US THE

GREATEST FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY. FOR A DISCUSSION OF CARDS ISSUED

INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH OUR GNS PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS, PLEASE

SEE THE SECTION GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES ABOVE.

THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO BOLSTER ITS INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY

CARD BUSINESS THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF NUMEROUS NEW OR ENHANCED

CARD PRODUCTS DURING 2010. THESE ARE CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, EITHER

ON OUR OWN OR AS CO-BRANDS WITH PARTNERING INSTITUTIONS. AS WE

HAVE RENEWED MANY OF OUR CO-BRAND AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTION

DEALS, WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON ADDING NEW PRODUCTS, NEW

CHANNELS, AND INCREASINGLY, NEW MARKETS TO THE AGREEMENTS. THIS

PAST YEAR, AMONG OTHER NEW PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE ANNOUNCED OR

LAUNCHED SEVERAL NEW CO-BRANDED PRODUCTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL

CONSUMER BUSINESS, INCLUDING: A NEW PLATINUM CO-BRAND CARD IN

PARTNERSHIP WITH AIR NEW ZEALAND, NEW ZEALANDS NATIONAL

AIR CARRIER; A CO-BRAND CARD PROGRAM WITH SOL MELIA, A LUXURY

HOTEL AND RESORT CHAIN BASED IN SPAIN; AND THE NEW STARWOOD

PREFERRED GUEST CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM AND CANADA, OFFERING CARDMEMBERS AND STARWOOD PREFERRED

GUESTS PROGRAM LOYALISTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN STARPOINTS ON

VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEIR CARD SPENDING. WE OFFER MANY OF THE SAME

PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS AS WE DO IN OUR U.S. PROPRIETARY

ISSUING BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE OFFER

VARIOUS FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS SIMILAR TO OUR SIGN &

TRAVEL

®

PROGRAM AND OUR EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION TO CARDMEMBERS IN

SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ALSO, AS IN THE UNITED

STATES, WE ISSUE CARDS INTERNATIONALLY UNDER DISTRIBUTION

AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE

OF OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS IS AFFINITY CARDS WITH

FRATERNAL, PROFESSIONAL, EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS.

FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PENETRATING THE

AFFINITY CARD SEGMENT IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE WE ISSUE CARDS WITH

THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGEST PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THAT

COUNTRY. IN AUSTRALIA, AFFINITY CARDS ARE A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF

OUR TOTAL REVOLVING PORTFOLIO AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR PROPRIETARY

CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES.

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAMS ARE A

STRONG DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING IN THE INTERNATIONAL

CONSUMER BUSINESS. WE HAVE MORE THAN 1,500 REDEMPTION PARTNERS

ACROSS OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WITH AN AVERAGE OF

APPROXIMATELY 84 PARTNERS IN EACH COUNTRY; APPROXIMATELY 30% OF

THESE PARTNERS ARE IN THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. CARDMEMBERS CAN

REDEEM THEIR POINTS WITH MORE THAN 40 AIRLINES AND OVER 175

HOTELS. OUR REDEMPTION OPTIONS INCLUDE TRAVEL, RETAIL

MERCHANDISE, ENTERTAINMENT, SHOPPING AND RECREATION GIFT

CERTIFICATES, EXPERIENCES, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CHARITY

REWARDS. IN 2010, WE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR REWARDS PROGRAMS

IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES, OFFERING MORE FLEXIBLE CHOICES THAT ENABLE

CARDMEMBERS TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS MORE QUICKLY.

WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE COMPANYS STRENGTHS AND LOOK

FOR FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE

INTERNATIONALLY. IN DECEMBER 2010, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE ENTERED

INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE LOYALTY PARTNER, A LEADING

MARKETING SERVICES COMPANY KNOWN FOR THE LOYALTY PROGRAMS IT

OPERATES IN GERMANY, POLAND AND INDIA. LOYALTY PARTNER ALSO

PROVIDES ANALYTICS, OPERATING PLATFORMS AND CONSULTING SERVICES

THAT HELP MERCHANTS GROW THEIR BUSINESSES. THE ACQUISITION WILL

DEEPEN OUR MERCHANT RELATIONSHIPS IN SELECT COUNTRIES, ADD MORE

THAN 34 MILLION CONSUMERS TO THE COMPANYS

INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER BASE AND EXPAND ITS RANGE OF REWARDS AND

LOYALTY MARKETING SERVICES. THE ACQUISITION IS PART OF THE

COMPANYS DRIVE TO BUILD AND DIVERSIFY ITS FEE SERVICE

REVENUES AND EXPAND ITS INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE. THE PURCHASE,

WHICH HAS RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL, IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. THE TRANSACTION, WHICH VALUES THE

COMPANY AT $660 MILLION (SUBJECT TO CURRENCY MOVEMENT AND

OTHER ADJUSTMENTS), CONSISTS OF AN UPFRONT CASH PURCHASE PRICE

OF $566 MILLION AND AN ADDITIONAL $94 MILLION EQUITY

INTEREST THAT THE COMPANY WILL ACQUIRE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS

AT A VALUE BASED ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE.

WE EXPANDED THE FLEXIBILITY OF PAYMENT FOR TRAVEL AND CONCIERGE

SERVICES BY ALLOWING INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS TO USE

THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TO PAY FOR THEIR TRAVEL

PURCHASES IN 15 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S.

INTERNATIONAL

PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARD  COMPETITION

COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES, CONSUMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES USE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS FOR A SMALLER

PERCENTAGE OF THEIR TOTAL PAYMENTS, WITH SOME LARGE EMERGING

MARKET COUNTRIES JUST BEGINNING TO TRANSITION TO CARD USAGE IN

ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. ALTHOUGH OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IS WIDESPREAD,

WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT SHARE IN THE COUNTRIES IN

WHICH WE OPERATE INTERNATIONALLY. OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING

BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM MULTINATIONAL BANKS,

SUCH AS CITIBANK, HSBC AND BANCO SANTANDER, AS WELL AS MANY

LOCAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. GLOBALLY, WE VIEW

CITIBANK AND BANCO SANTANDER AS OUR STRONGEST COMPETITORS, AS

THEY CURRENTLY OFFER CARD PRODUCTS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF

COUNTRIES.

INTERNATIONAL

PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARD  REGULATION

AS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS

FORM 10-K,

REGULATORS IN 2010 CONTINUED TO PROPOSE AND ENACT A VARIETY OF

REGULATORY CHANGES TO THE PAYMENTS LANDSCAPE IN MANY OF OUR KEY

COUNTRIES. WE EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE IN 2011.

REGULATORS CONTINUE TO CONSIDER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO HELP INFORM THEIR POLICY.

WHILE THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSALS VARIES, REGULATORS IN A NUMBER

OF COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON PRICING, DISCLOSURE,

RESPONSIBLE LENDING AND OTHER CARD PRACTICES AND WE EXPECT THIS

TO CONTINUE IN 2011. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THE

GOVERNMENT ADOPTED A NEW POLICY BY WAY OF A WHITE

PAPER SETTING OUT SEVERAL REQUIREMENTS AROUND CARD

PRACTICES. IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, MEMBER STATES HAVE

IMPLEMENTED OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING EUROPEAN

DIRECTIVE 2008/48/EC ON CREDIT AGREEMENTS FOR CONSUMERS

(COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE CONSUMER CREDIT DIRECTIVE), WHICH

IN SOME COUNTRIES WILL HAVE IMPACTS ON CHARGE CARDS IN ADDITION

TO CREDIT CARDS. MEMBER STATES HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED THE PAYMENT

SERVICES DIRECTIVE, WHICH REGULATES THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS OF

PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS.

AS A CONSEQUENCE, THESE AND PERHAPS OTHER REGULATORS MAY

CONSIDER AND IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL CARD PRACTICE REGULATION IN

2011. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS PLANNING IN LIGHT OF

CHANGING MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE EVOLVING POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND MEDIA ENVIRONMENT.

EXPENSES. THE CORPORATE PURCHASING CARD HELPS LARGE CORPORATIONS

AND MID-SIZED COMPANIES MANAGE THEIR EVERYDAY SPENDING. IT IS

UNITED STATES AS FIRMS WITH ANNUAL REVENUES OF $10 MILLION

TO $1 BILLION WORLDWIDE). GCC IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO

EXPAND ITS BUSINESS WITH MID-SIZED COMPANIES, WHICH REPRESENT

SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. BUSINESSES OF THIS SIZE OFTEN

DO NOT HAVE A CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM. HOWEVER, ONCE ENROLLED,

MID-SIZED COMPANIES TYPICALLY PUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR

BUSINESS SPENDING ON THE CORPORATE CARD BECAUSE THEY CAN GAIN

CONTROL, SAVINGS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

GLOBAL

COMMERCIAL CARDCOMPETITION

THE COMMERCIAL PAYMENTS SECTOR IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE, WITH COMPETITION INCREASINGLY INTENSE AT BOTH THE

CARD NETWORK AND CARD ISSUER LEVELS. AT THE NETWORK LEVEL, WE

HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASING COMPETITION INCLUDING INTENSE PRICE

COMPETITION, AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION INTO NEW AND EMERGING

SEGMENTS, EFFORTS TO TRANSITION

BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS

SPEND FROM CASH AND CHECK TO CARDS AND ELECTRONIC INVOICING AND

PAYMENT VEHICLES, AND EXPANDING MARKETING AND ADVERTISING

BUDGETS FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES. BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD

CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CARD ISSUERS SUCH AS U.S. BANK,

JPMORGAN CHASE, AND CITIBANK TO BUILD AND SUPPORT DATA

COLLECTION AND REPORTING NECESSARY TO SATISFY CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS. MOREOVER, IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE

INTEREST IN EXPENSE MANAGEMENT TOOLS IS PARTICULARLY STRONG, AS

CLIENTS AIM TO CAPTURE DATA, ANALYZE TRENDS AND MAKE DECISIONS

THAT ENHANCE THEIR CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY. COMMERCIAL CARD

ISSUERS HAVE INCREASINGLY ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS TO

ENHANCE DATA CAPTURE CAPABILITIES AND REPORTING FUNCTIONALITY.

IN ADDITION, MANY ISSUERS ATTEMPT TO LEVERAGE THEIR BANKING

RELATIONSHIPS AND CAPABILITIES TO SECURE AND RETAIN CARD

BUSINESS. GLOBAL SERVICING, DATA QUALITY, TECHNOLOGICAL

FUNCTIONALITY AND SIMPLICITY, CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, AND PRICE AND

OTHER FINANCIAL TERMS ARE AMONG THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN

THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS.

GLOBAL

COMMERCIAL CARDREGULATION

THE GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS, WHICH ENGAGES IN THE

EXTENSION OF COMMERCIAL CREDIT, IS SUBJECT TO MORE LIMITED

REGULATION THAN OUR CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS. IN THE UNITED

STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS

APPLICABLE TO OUR CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE EQUAL

CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT, THE FCRA (AS AMENDED BY THE FACT ACT),

AS WELL LAWS THAT GENERALLY PROHIBIT ENGAGING IN UNFAIR AND

DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FACT ACT,

SEE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS  REGULATION.)

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN STATE LAWS THAT REGULATE FEES AND

CHARGES ON OUR PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, AS A GLOBAL BUSINESS, WE

ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. STATE DATA SECURITY AND BREACH

NOTIFICATION LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DATA

PROTECTION LAWS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES

IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO BANKRUPTCY AND

DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS THAT CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT

AMOUNTS OWED TO US. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ALONG WITH THE REST OF

OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK

SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS. (FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THIS LEGISLATION AND ITS EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS,

COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL

BUSINESS TRAVEL  COMPETITION

GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL CONTINUES TO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN

THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FROM NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL

AND ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM DIRECT

SALES BY AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS. COMPETITION AMONG

TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE,

VALUE CREATION, CONVENIENCE, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY

TO THE CUSTOMER. COMPETITION ALSO COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS

THEMSELVES, AS SOME COMPANIES HAVE BECOME ACCREDITED AS IN-HOUSE

CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS. NEW ENTRANTS COULD ALSO REPRESENT

ADDITIONAL COMPETITION ALONG THE END TO END TRAVEL VALUE CHAIN,

WHICH COULD IMPACT COMPETITION IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM.

FOR MANY YEARS, TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES HAVE FACED PRESSURE

ON REVENUES FROM AIRLINES, AS MOST CARRIERS HAVE STOPPED PAYING

BASE COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD

AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OTHER FORMS OF TRAVEL AGENT

COMPENSATION. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF

TRANSACTIONS THEY BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR WEB SITES AND

OTHER MEANS. THESE TRENDS HAVE REDUCED THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES

FOR TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT RECEIVE

DISTRIBUTION REVENUE FROM DIRECTLY BOOKED TRANSACTIONS. IN

RECENT YEARS, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES,

RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS

INCLUDING EXPANDED GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE

ALLIANCES. THIS IMMUNITY ENABLES AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE

THEIR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED

JOINT VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS. THESE TYPES

OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO

TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

CONCERNING THESE ISSUES, PLEASE SEE RISK

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS

IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS

OVERALL, INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES,

THE ONGOING TRENDS OF INCREASING DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES, THE

RISE OF LOW-COST CARRIERS AND ONGOING REDUCTIONS IN OR

ELIMINATION OF AIRLINE COMMISSIONS AND FEES, CONTINUE TO PUT

PRESSURE ON REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY FOR TRAVEL AGENTS.

OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE EVOLVED OUR BUSINESS MODEL TO

PERMIT US TO CHARGE CUSTOMERS FOR THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE AND

THE VALUE WE CREATE, AND RESTRUCTURED OUR EXPENSE BASE THROUGH

THE RATIONALIZATION OF OUR CALL CENTER LOCATIONS AND THE

TRANSITIONING OF MANY OF OUR SERVICES ONLINE. WE CONTINUE TO

LOOK FOR NEW WAYS TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE DELIVER FOR OUR

GLOBAL

PAYMENT OPTIONS  REGULATION

AS AN ISSUER OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS AND A

PROVIDER OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES, WE ARE REGULATED IN THE

UNITED STATES UNDER THE MONEY TRANSMITTER OR

SALE OF CHECK LAWS IN EFFECT IN MOST STATES. THESE

LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHEQUE (AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, PREPAID

CARD) ISSUERS, AS WELL AS PROVIDERS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE

SERVICES, TO OBTAIN LICENSES, TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND

SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN

HIGHLY RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE DETAILED

REPORTS. WE INVEST THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF OUR TRAVELERS

CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW,

PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY RATED DEBT SECURITIES CONSISTING

PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM FEDERAL, STATE AND

MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS. MANY STATES EXAMINE LICENSEES ANNUALLY.

IN ADDITION, FEDERAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS REQUIRE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELER CHEQUE ISSUERS

AND THE PROVIDERS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES AS MONEY

SERVICE BUSINESSES AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE VARYING LICENSING AND

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE

SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.

TRAVELERS CHEQUE ISSUERS ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAWS OF MANY STATES

TO COMPLY WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS UNDER

WHICH SUCH ISSUERS MUST PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY

TRAVELERS CHEQUE THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER A PERIOD

OF TIME, USUALLY 15 YEARS. THE ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS OF

NUMEROUS STATES ALSO APPLY TO PREPAID CARDS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS.

IN MAY 2009, THE CARD ACT AMENDED PROVISIONS OF THE ELECTRONIC

FUNDS TRANSFER ACT TO IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE TERMS OF

GIFT CARDS AND CERTAIN OTHER PREPAID CARDS, INCLUDING

RESTRICTIONS ON THE FEES THAT MAY BE CHARGED, EXPIRATION DATES,

AND CONSUMER DISCLOSURES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED FINAL

REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE CARD ACT GIFT CARD PROVISIONS THAT

BECAME EFFECTIVE IN AUGUST 2010. CONGRESS THEREAFTER PASSED

LEGISLATION THAT EXTENDED THE AUGUST 2010 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE

CARD ACT GIFT CARD PROVISIONS TO JANUARY 2011 FOR GIFT CARDS

PRODUCED PRIOR TO APRIL 1, 2010, PROVIDED CERTAIN

CONDITIONS ARE MET. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR STATE LEGISLATIVE

ACTIVITY RESTRICTING THE TERMS OF GIFT CARDS. IN CERTAIN STATES

WHERE REGULATION CONTINUES TO RESTRICT FEES AND HAS MADE IT

UNPROFITABLE FOR US TO OFFER GIFT CARDS, WE HAVE LIMITED OR

WITHDRAWN FROM SELLING THESE CARDS.

IN JUNE 2010, THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK, AN

ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,

ISSUED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE MAKING THAT PROPOSES A

NUMBER OF CHANGES TO ITS REGULATION OF THE PREPAID INDUSTRY. IN

GENERAL, THE PROPOSED RULE REDEFINES THE TERM STORED

VALUE MORE BROADLY AND RENAMES THIS GROUP OF PRODUCTS

PREPAID ACCESS. THE THREE TRADITIONAL CATEGORIES OF

STORED VALUE PARTICIPANTS, ISSUERS, SELLERS AND REDEEMERS

OF STORED VALUE, ARE NOW CONSOLIDATED INTO TWO GROUPS,

PROVIDERS AND SELLERS OF PREPAID ACCESS. WITH

LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THE PROPOSED RULE IMPOSES SUSPICIOUS

ACTIVITY REPORTING, CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION, AND RECORD KEEPING

REQUIREMENTS ON THE TWO NEWLY DEFINED GROUPS, WHICH COULD MEAN

NON-BANK PROGRAM MANAGERS AND RETAILERS WOULD HAVE TO DEVELOP

AND MAINTAIN AML PROGRAMS THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED. THE

PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD FOR THE PROPOSED RULE CLOSED ON

AUGUST 27, 2010. WE ARE AWAITING ISSUANCE OF THE FINAL RULE

AND WILL ANALYZE ITS IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS ONCE THE

FINAL RULE IS ISSUED.

DODD-FRANK TO ESTABLISH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INTERCHANGE FEE

LIMITATION RULES FOR DEBIT OR PREPAID GIFT CARD TRANSACTIONS,

ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS (WHICH APPLIES TO ALL PREPAID

CARDS).

THE GLOBAL SERVICES GROUP (GLOBAL SERVICES) WAS

CREATED TO HEIGHTEN THE COMPANYS FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE

WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS, BOTH IN THE UNITED

STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, IN OUR CARD SYSTEMS AND

INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW FASTER INTRODUCTION AND GREATER

CUSTOMIZATION OF PRODUCTS. WE ALSO ARE USING TECHNOLOGY TO

DEVELOP AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICE CAPABILITIES TO CONTINUE TO

DELIVER A HIGH QUALITY CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE

MAINTAIN A SERVICE DELIVERY PLATFORM THAT OUR EMPLOYEES USE IN

THE CARD BUSINESS TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER SERVICING AND

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE,

UPDATING OF CARDMEMBER INFORMATION, THE ADDITION OF NEW CARDS TO

AN ACCOUNT AND RESOLVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ISSUES. IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE ARE ENHANCING OUR GLOBAL PLATFORMS AND

CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS IN REVOLVING CREDIT.

WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE THE INTERNET TO LOWER COSTS, IMPROVE

SERVICE QUALITY AND ENHANCE OUR BUSINESS MODEL. DURING 2010, WE

CONTINUED TO BROADEN OUR FOCUS TO USE THE INTERNET TO DRIVE

REVENUE AND BUILD OUR BRAND, WHILE CONTINUING TO MIGRATE

TRANSACTION VOLUMES AT LOWER COSTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO HAVE

MORE ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE INTERACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

THAN WE DO BY TELEPHONE OR IN PERSON.

SUPERVISION

AND REGULATION  GENERAL

OVERVIEW

FEDERAL AND STATE BANKING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES

EXTENSIVELY REGULATE THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND

AEBFSB, INCLUDING PRESCRIBING STANDARDS RELATING TO CAPITAL,

EARNINGS, LIQUIDITY, DIVIDENDS, THE REPURCHASE OR REDEMPTION OF

SHARES, LOANS OR EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO AFFILIATES AND INSIDERS,

INTERNAL CONTROLS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INTERNAL AUDIT SYSTEMS,

LOAN DOCUMENTATION, CREDIT UNDERWRITING, ASSET GROWTH AND

IMPAIRED ASSETS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS

ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR THE PROTECTION OF DEPOSITORS, OTHER

CUSTOMERS AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS, AS WELL AS TO

MINIMIZE SYSTEMIC RISK, AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR

SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF

2008, SUPERVISORY EFFORTS TO APPLY THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND

POLICIES HAVE BECOME MORE INTENSE.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 (BHC ACT)

AND HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES

UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BHC ACT,

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE. UNDER THE SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL

REGULATION ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE SUPERVISES THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS NON-BANK

SUBSIDIARIES, AS AN UMBRELLA REGULATOR OF THE

CONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATION AND GENERALLY DEFERS TO THE PRIMARY

U.S. REGULATORS OF THE COMPANYS U.S. DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, AS APPLICABLE. BANK REGULATORY

AGENCIES HAVE BROAD EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT POWER OVER BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THE POWER TO

IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL FINES, LIMIT DIVIDENDS, RESTRICT OPERATIONS

AND ACQUISITIONS AND REQUIRE DIVESTITURES. BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES AND BANKS, AS WELL AS SUBSIDIARIES OF BOTH, ARE

PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ENGAGING IN PRACTICES THAT THE RELEVANT

REGULATORY AUTHORITY DEEMS UNSAFE OR UNSOUND.

MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS

REGULATION BY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND BY

NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES OR REGULATORY BODIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES. CERTAIN

OF OUR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO THE

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 (SARBANES-OXLEY) AND

RELATED REGULATIONS AND RULES OF THE SEC AND THE NEW YORK STOCK

EXCHANGE, INC. AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TO THE EXTENT

THAT DIFFERENT REGULATORY SYSTEMS IMPOSE OVERLAPPING OR

INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE

FACE COMPLEXITY AND ADDITIONAL COSTS IN OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

THE

DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

ACT

DODD-FRANK, WHICH WAS ENACTED IN JULY 2010, SIGNIFICANTLY

RESTRUCTURES THE FINANCIAL REGULATORY REGIME IN THE UNITED

STATES, INCLUDING THROUGH THE CREATION OF A NEW SYSTEMIC RISK

OVERSIGHT BODY, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL

(FSOC). THE FSOC WILL OVERSEE AND COORDINATE THE

EFFORTS OF THE PRIMARY U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATORY AGENCIES

(INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE SEC, THE U.S. COMMODITY

FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, THE OCC AND THE FDIC) IN

ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL STABILITY

CONCERNS. DODD-FRANK DIRECTS THE FSOC TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO

THE FEDERAL RESERVE AS TO SUPERVISORY REQUIREMENTS AND

PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH

$50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDES THE COMPANY, AND OTHER SYSTEMICALLY

IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE STANDARDS INCLUDE CAPITAL,

LEVERAGE, LIQUIDITY AND RISK-MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS. DODD-FRANK

MANDATES THAT THE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO SYSTEMICALLY

IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE

APPLICABLE TO OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES.

IN ADDITION TO THE FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEMIC RISK OVERSIGHT

IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE FSOC, DODD-FRANK BROADLY AFFECTS THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN NUMEROUS RESPECTS, INCLUDING BY

CREATING A RESOLUTION AUTHORITY, BY REQUIRING BANKS TO PAY

INCREASED FEES TO REGULATORY AGENCIES, BY REQUIRING ALL PUBLICLY

TRADED BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE ASSETS OF AT LEAST

$10 BILLION TO ESTABLISH A RISK COMMITTEE (INCLUDING

INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS) RESPONSIBLE FOR ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK

MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT AND PRACTICES, AND THROUGH NUMEROUS OTHER

PROVISIONS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE SOUND OPERATION OF THE

FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. MOREOVER, TITLE X OF DODD-FRANK,

KNOWN AS THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT OF 2010 (THE

CFPA), PROVIDES FOR THE CREATION OF THE CONSUMER

FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, A NEW CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES

REGULATOR, DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER CONSUMER FINANCIAL

PROTECTION ACT OF 2010. NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES

TO EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN

INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT) COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS DISCUSSED

FURTHER THROUGHOUT THIS SECTION, MANY ASPECTS OF DODD-FRANK ARE

SUBJECT TO FURTHER RULEMAKING AND WILL TAKE EFFECT OVER SEVERAL

YEARS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANY OR ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION TO THE

DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION, PLEASE SEE RISK

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SOME OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT LEGISLATIVE

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CONSUMER

FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT OF 2010

AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE CFPA PROVIDES FOR THE CREATION OF THE

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (THE BUREAU), A

NEW CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATOR. AS OF JULY 21,

2011, BUT SUBJECT TO A POSSIBLE SIX-MONTH EXTENSION, OUR

MARKETING AND SALE OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND OUR

COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS,

INCLUDING THE CFPA AND THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT, WILL BE

SUPERVISED AND EXAMINED BY THE BUREAU. ON THAT DATE, THE BUREAU

WILL ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FROM OUR CURRENT BANKING REGULATORS

FOR SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION OF CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB, AND

THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH

FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS. THE BUREAU WILL HAVE AUTHORITY

TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST US FOR VIOLATION OF THOSE

LAWS AND ALSO WILL HAVE EXCLUSIVE RULEMAKING AUTHORITY FOR SUCH

FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS. IN THE INTERIM, THE FEDERAL

BANKING AGENCIES HAVE BEEN VIGOROUSLY ENFORCING CONSUMER

PROTECTION LAWS.

THE BUREAU ALSO WILL BE DIRECTED TO PROHIBIT UNFAIR,

DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES AND TO ENSURE THAT

ALL CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO MARKETS FOR CONSUMER FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THAT SUCH MARKETS ARE FAIR,

TRANSPARENT AND COMPETITIVE. THE NEW LEGISLATION ALSO WEAKENS

FEDERAL PREEMPTION AVAILABLE TO FEDERAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS,

INCLUDING AEBFSB, AND GIVES STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL THE ABILITY

TO ENFORCE APPLICABLE FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS.

FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES

THE BHC ACT LIMITS THE NONBANKING ACTIVITIES OF BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES. UNLESS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY HAS QUALIFIED AS A

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, ITS NONBANKING ACTIVITIES

ARE RESTRICTED TO THOSE THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DETERMINED

ARE SO CLOSELY RELATED TO BANKING AS TO BE A PROPER

INCIDENT THERETO. AN ELIGIBLE BANK HOLDING COMPANY MAY

ELECT TO BE A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO

ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES. A FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY MAY ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT HAS BEEN

DETERMINED BY RULE OR ORDER TO BE FINANCIAL IN NATURE,

INCIDENTAL TO SUCH FINANCIAL ACTIVITY, OR (WITH PRIOR FEDERAL

RESERVE APPROVAL) COMPLEMENTARY TO A FINANCIAL ACTIVITY AND THAT

DOES NOT POSE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THE SAFETY OR SOUNDNESS OF A

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR TO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM GENERALLY.

FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING

JULY 21, 2011, BUT SUBJECT TO A POSSIBLE SIX-MONTH

THE COMPANY AND TRS ALSO MUST BE AND REMAIN WELL CAPITALIZED AND

WELL MANAGED. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO CONTINUE TO MEET

APPLICABLE CAPITAL OR MANAGERIAL STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY STATUS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO AN

AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE

CAPITAL AND MANAGERIAL STANDARDS. MOREOVER, UNTIL ALL RELEVANT

CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED, THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES WOULD NOT, WITHOUT THE FEDERAL RESERVES PRIOR

APPROVAL, BE PERMITTED TO COMMENCE ANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES, OR

ACQUIRE CONTROL OR SHARES OF ANY COMPANY, IN RELIANCE ON THE

COMPANYS STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, AND THE

COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL

LIMITATIONS THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE IMPOSES. IF A COMPANY DOES

NOT RETURN TO COMPLIANCE WITHIN 180 DAYS, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE MAY ORDER THE COMPANY TO DIVEST ITS SUBSIDIARY

U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS OR THE COMPANY MAY DISCONTINUE

OR DIVEST INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES

PERMISSIBLE ONLY FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY THAT HAS ELECTED TO

BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. IN ADDITION, IF ANY

SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FAILS TO MAINTAIN A

HEIGHTENED

PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DODD-FRANK CREATES A NEW SYSTEMIC RISK

OVERSIGHT BODY, THE FSOC, TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND ADDRESS

POTENTIAL THREATS TO U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY.

ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK IMPOSES HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL

REQUIREMENTS ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST

$50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE

COMPANY, AND REQUIRES THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ESTABLISH

PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR SUCH LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT

ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE APPLICABLE TO OTHER BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES, INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR RISK-BASED CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS AND LEVERAGE LIMITS, LIQUIDITY, RISK-MANAGEMENT

REQUIREMENTS, RESOLUTION PLANS (REFERRED TO AS LIVING

WILLS), CREDIT EXPOSURE REPORTING, AND CONCENTRATION. THE

FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH

ADDITIONAL PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS, ON ITS OWN OR AT THE

FSOCS RECOMMENDATION, REGARDING CONTINGENT CAPITAL,

ENHANCED PUBLIC DISCLOSURES, SHORT-TERM DEBT LIMITS AND

OTHERWISE AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO CONDUCT ANNUAL

ANALYSES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST

$50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS TO EVALUATE

WHETHER THE COMPANIES HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL ON A TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED BASIS NECESSARY TO ABSORB LOSSES AS A RESULT OF

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, SUCH LARGE BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, MUST CONDUCT SIMILAR

SO-CALLED STRESS TESTS ON A SEMIANNUAL BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, SUCH LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES MAY BE REQUIRED

TO MAINTAIN A

DEBT-TO-EQUITY

RATIO OF NO MORE THAN 15 TO 1 UPON A DETERMINATION BY THE FSOC

THAT THE COMPANY POSES A GRAVE THREAT TO THE FINANCIAL STABILITY

OF THE U.S. AND THE IMPOSITION OF SUCH REQUIREMENT IS

NECESSARY TO MITIGATE THE POSED THREAT.

AS NOTED ABOVE, DODD-FRANK WILL REQUIRE US TO PREPARE AND

PROVIDE TO REGULATORS A RESOLUTION PLAN THAT MUST, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, ENSURE THAT OUR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE

ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM RISKS ARISING FROM OUR OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES. THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS

RESOLUTION PLAN MAY, AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, PRESENT ADDITIONAL

CONSTRAINTS ON TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN

OUR BANK AND NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACTIVITIES

AND ACQUISITIONS

THE BHC ACT REQUIRES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR

APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE: (1) IT MAY ACQUIRE

DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF

ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, IF AFTER SUCH

ACQUISITION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WILL DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY OWN OR CONTROL MORE THAN 5% OF ANY CLASS OF THE

VOTING SECURITIES OF THE INSTITUTION; (2) IT OR ANY OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, OTHER THAN A BANK, MAY ACQUIRE ALL OR

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN

ASSOCIATION; OR (3) IT MAY MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH ANY

OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST APPROVE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL

CONTRIBUTIONS TO AN EXISTING

NON-U.S. INVESTMENT

AND CERTAIN DIRECT AND INDIRECT ACQUISITIONS BY THE COMPANY OF

AN INTEREST IN A

NON-U.S. COMPANY,

INCLUDING IN A FOREIGN BANK, AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT BY

CENTURION BANK OF FOREIGN BRANCHES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

ADDITIONALLY, A PROVISION OF DODD-FRANK THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE ON

THE DAY OF ENACTMENT REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN $50 BILLION TO

PROVIDE THE FEDERAL RESERVE WITH WRITTEN NOTICE PRIOR TO

ACQUIRING DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING

SHARES OF ANY COMPANY (OTHER THAN AN INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION) THAT IS ENGAGED IN FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED

IN SECTION 4(K) OF THE BHC ACT AND THAT HAS TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $10 BILLION OR MORE, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. MOREOVER, ANOTHER PROVISION OF DODD-FRANK

THAT IS EFFECTIVE ON THE TRANSFER DATE OF JULY 21, 2011,

BUT SUBJECT TO A POSSIBLE SIX-MONTH EXTENSION, REQUIRES

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES TO OBTAIN FEDERAL RESERVE APPROVAL

PRIOR TO ACQUIRING A NONBANK COMPANY WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS IN EXCESS OF $10 BILLION.

THE CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL ACT PROHIBITS A PERSON, ENTITY, OR

GROUP OF PERSONS OR ENTITIES ACTING IN CONCERT, FROM ACQUIRING

CONTROL OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUCH AS THE

COMPANY UNLESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BEEN GIVEN PRIOR NOTICE

AND HAS NOT OBJECTED TO THE TRANSACTION. UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE

REGULATIONS, THE ACQUISITION OF 10% OR MORE OF A CLASS OF VOTING

STOCK OF THE COMPANY WOULD GENERALLY CREATE A REBUTTABLE

PRESUMPTION OF ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE BHC ACT, ANY COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO

OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE ACQUIRING

CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCLUDES THE

ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OF OR CONTROL OVER 25% OR MORE OF ANY

CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY OR THE POWER TO

EXERCISE A CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER THE COMPANY.

IN THE CASE OF AN ACQUIRER THAT IS A BANK OR BANK HOLDING

COMPANY, THE BHC ACT REQUIRES APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

FOR THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING

SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY, IF THE ACQUISITION RESULTS IN THE

BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY CONTROLLING MORE THAN 5% OF THE

OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE

COMPANY.

SOURCE OF

STRENGTH

FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY HISTORICALLY HAS REQUIRED BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO THEIR BANK

SUBSIDIARIES AND TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO

SUPPORT THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. DODD-FRANK MAKES THIS A STATUTORY

REQUIREMENT AND EXTENDS IT TO ALL INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARIES BEGINNING ON JULY 21, 2011, SUBJECT TO A

POSSIBLE SIX-MONTH EXTENSION. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY IS EXPECTED

TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB AND

TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BOTH

INSTITUTIONS. SUCH SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED AT TIMES WHEN, ABSENT

THIS REQUIREMENT, WE OTHERWISE MIGHT DETERMINE NOT TO

PROVIDE IT.

CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY

BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO

CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE

EVENT OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY

COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK

REGULATOR TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK WILL BE

ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF

PAYMENT.

CAPITAL

ADEQUACY

THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO

COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES

ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS. THERE ARE TWO

RISK-BASED MEASURES OF

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAPITAL ADEQUACY FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN

PROMULGATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, AS WELL AS A LEVERAGE

MEASURE.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY CALCULATES ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS

UNDER GUIDELINES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, BASED ON THE

1998 CAPITAL ACCORD (BASEL I) OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE

ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE BASEL COMMITTEE). IN

JUNE 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED NEW INTERNATIONAL

GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING REGULATORY CAPITAL (BASEL

II). IN DECEMBER 2007, THE U.S. BANK REGULATORY

AGENCIES JOINTLY ADOPTED A FINAL RULE BASED ON BASEL II. THE

COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO TRANSITION TO

THE BASEL II BASED GUIDELINES NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1,

2013, UNLESS EXTENDED BY ITS REGULATORS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE

BASEL COMMITTEE RELEASED ITS FINAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING

INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REGULATION, NOW OFFICIALLY

IDENTIFIED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE AS BASEL III.

BASEL III, WHEN IMPLEMENTED BY THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES

AND FULLY PHASED-IN, WILL REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND

THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL,

WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON EQUITY. EACH BASEL ACCORD IS

DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENCES IN

CREDIT AND MARKET RISK PROFILES AMONG BANKS AND FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANIES, TO ACCOUNT FOR OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURE,

AND TO MINIMIZE DISINCENTIVES FOR HOLDING LIQUID ASSETS. ASSETS

AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS ARE ASSIGNED TO BROAD RISK

CATEGORIES, EACH WITH APPROPRIATE WEIGHTS. THE RESULTING CAPITAL

RATIOS REPRESENT CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED

ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS. AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER,

FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES EXPECT MOST BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES, AND IN PARTICULAR LARGER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH

AS THE COMPANY, TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS THAT, AT A

MINIMUM, QUALIFY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL CAPITALIZED. THE

REQUIRED RATIOS TO QUALIFY AS WELL CAPITALIZED ARE A TOTAL

RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10%, A TIER 1

RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6% AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF

AT LEAST 5%. THE GUIDELINES ALSO PROVIDE THAT BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES EXPERIENCING INTERNAL GROWTH OR MAKING ACQUISITIONS

WILL BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN STRONG CAPITAL POSITIONS

SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE MINIMUM SUPERVISORY LEVELS WITHOUT

SIGNIFICANT RELIANCE ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FOLLOWING THE RECENT

FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE

ENCOURAGED LARGER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL

RATIOS APPRECIABLY ABOVE THE WELL CAPITALIZED

STANDARD. MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS FOCUSING MORE ON THE

REGULATORY REQUIREMENT THAT COMMON EQUITY BE THE

PREDOMINANT ELEMENT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL.

FURTHERMORE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL

CONSIDER A TANGIBLE TIER 1 CAPITAL LEVERAGE

RATIO (DEDUCTING ALL INTANGIBLES) AND OTHER INDICATORS OF

CAPITAL STRENGTH IN EVALUATING PROPOSALS FOR EXPANSION OR NEW

ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ASSESSED THE

CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF THE COUNTRYS 19 LARGEST BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, UNDER A SO-CALLED STRESS

TEST.

PAGES 39-41 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS,

WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

BASEL

I

THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB CURRENTLY CALCULATE

REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BASEL I, AS ADOPTED BY THE

APPLICABLE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES. UNDER BASEL I,

AS ADOPTED, THE MINIMUM GUIDELINE FOR THE RATIO OF TOTAL CAPITAL

TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (INCLUDING CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ITEMS, SUCH AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT) IS 8%. AT LEAST HALF

OF THE TOTAL CAPITAL MUST BE COMPOSED OF TIER 1 CAPITAL,

WHICH INCLUDES COMMON EQUITY, UNDIVIDED PROFITS, MINORITY

INTERESTS IN THE EQUITY ACCOUNTS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

(INCLUDING, FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES BUT NOT BANKS, TRUST

PREFERRED SECURITIES), NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK

AND FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (BUT NOT BANKS) A LIMITED AMOUNT

OF CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, LESS GOODWILL AND

CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY CONSIST

OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, QUALIFYING SUBORDINATED DEBT,

MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, OTHER PREFERRED STOCK

AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED

STOCK, TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND OTHER SO-CALLED

RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS ARE GENERALLY

LIMITED TO 25% OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. THE MINIMUM GUIDELINE FOR

THE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS IS 4%.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES STATE THAT THE CAPITAL GUIDELINES

ARE MINIMUM STANDARDS BASED PRIMARILY ON BROAD CREDIT-RISK

CONSIDERATIONS AND DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE OTHER TYPES OF

RISK A BANKING ORGANIZATION MAY BE EXPOSED TO (E.G., INTEREST

RATE, MARKET, LIQUIDITY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS). THE FEDERAL

RESERVE MAY, THEREFORE, SET HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR

CATEGORIES OF BANKS (E.G., SYSTEMATICALLY IMPORTANT FIRMS), OR

FOR AN INDIVIDUAL BANK, AS SITUATIONS WARRANT.

BASEL

II

THE U.S. BASEL II FINAL RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE ON

APRIL 1, 2008. THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE

REQUIRED TO TRANSITION TO THE BASEL II-BASED GUIDELINES BY

JANUARY 1, 2013,UNLESS EXTENDED BY ITS REGULATORS. THE

FINAL RULE PROVIDES FOR A SERIES OF THREE TRANSITIONAL PERIODS

DURING WHICH THE COMPANY MUST CALCULATE ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL

RATIOS UNDER BOTH THE BASEL I-BASED GUIDELINES AND THE NEW BASEL

II-BASED GUIDELINES, WITH THE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIODS BEING THE GREATER OF THE

REQUIRED CAPITAL AS CALCULATED UNDER THE FINAL RULE AND A

DESIGNATED PERCENTAGE OF REQUIRED CAPITAL AS CALCULATED UNDER

BASEL I. PRIOR TO BEGINNING THE THREE TRANSITIONAL PERIODS, WE

MUST COMPLETE A SATISFACTORY PARALLEL-RUN PERIOD OF NO LESS THAN

FOUR CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR QUARTERS DURING WHICH WE WILL BE

REQUIRED TO CONFIDENTIALLY REPORT REGULATORY CAPITAL UNDER BOTH

THE BASEL I AND BASEL II REGULATIONS. UNDER THE FINAL RULE,

WE MUST BEGIN THE FIRST TRANSITIONAL PERIOD FOR CAPITAL

CALCULATION UNDER THE FINAL RULE NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1,

2013, UNLESS THIS TIME IS EXTENDED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

DODD-FRANK APPEARS TO REQUIRE THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ADOPT

REGULATIONS IMPOSING A CONTINUING FLOOR OF THE BASEL

I-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES IN CASES WHERE THE BASEL II-BASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ANY CHANGES IN CAPITAL REGULATIONS

RESULTING FROM BASEL III OTHERWISE WOULD PERMIT LOWER

REQUIREMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUBLISHED

FOR COMMENT PROPOSED REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THIS REQUIREMENT.

LEVERAGE

REQUIREMENT

BASEL I AND BASEL II DO NOT INCLUDE A LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT

AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD. HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS

ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES FOR BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES (AND, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW, BASEL III WILL

IMPOSE A LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD). THE

FEDERAL RESERVES EXISTING GUIDELINES PROVIDE FOR A MINIMUM

RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS, LESS

GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (THE LEVERAGE

RATIO), OF 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT MEET CERTAIN

SPECIFIED CRITERIA, INCLUDING HAVING THE HIGHEST REGULATORY

RATING. ALL OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY ARE REQUIRED

TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 4%.

BASEL

III

THE BASEL III FINAL CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, AMONG OTHER THINGS.



INTRODUCES AS A NEW CAPITAL MEASURE COMMON EQUITY

TIER 1

,

OR CET1, SPECIFIES THAT

TIER 1 CAPITAL CONSISTS OF CET1 AND ADDITIONAL

TIER 1 CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS MEETING SPECIFIED

REQUIREMENTS, DEFINES CET1 NARROWLY BY REQUIRING THAT MOST

ADJUSTMENTS TO REGULATORY CAPITAL MEASURES BE MADE TO CET1 AND

NOT TO THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL, AND EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF

THE ADJUSTMENTS AS COMPARED TO EXISTING REGULATIONS;



WHEN FULLY PHASED IN ON JAN. 1, 2019, REQUIRES BANKS TO

MAINTAIN.



AS A NEWLY ADOPTED INTERNATIONAL STANDARD, A MINIMUM RATIO OF

CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST 4.5%, PLUS A 2.5%

CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH IS ADDED TO THE

4.5% CET1 RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS PHASED IN, EFFECTIVELY

RESULTING IN A MINIMUM RATIO OF CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF

AT LEAST 7% (THERE IS NO COMPARABLE CET1 REQUIREMENT UNDER BASEL

I OR II)



A MINIMUM RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS

OF AT LEAST 6.0%, PLUS THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH IS

ADDED TO THE 6.0% TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS

PHASED IN, EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN A MINIMUM TIER 1

CAPITAL RATIO OF 8.5% UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION (THE CURRENT

REQUIREMENT IS 6.00% FOR A WELL CAPITALIZED BANK)

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS



A MINIMUM RATIO OF TOTAL (THAT IS, TIER 1 PLUS

TIER 2) CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF AT LEAST

8.0%, PLUS THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH IS ADDED TO

THE 8.0% TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO AS THAT BUFFER IS PHASED IN,

EFFECTIVELY RESULTING IN A MINIMUM TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF 10.5%

UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION (THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT IS 10% FOR A

WELL CAPITALIZED BANK) AND



AS A NEWLY ADOPTED INTERNATIONAL STANDARD, A MINIMUM LEVERAGE

RATIO OF 3%, CALCULATED AS THE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO

BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES PLUS CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES

(AS THE AVERAGE FOR EACH QUARTER OF THE MONTH-END RATIOS FOR THE

QUARTER) AND



PROVIDES FOR A COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER,

GENERALLY TO BE IMPOSED WHEN NATIONAL REGULATORS DETERMINE THAT

EXCESS AGGREGATE CREDIT GROWTH BECOMES ASSOCIATED WITH A BUILDUP

OF SYSTEMIC RISK, THAT WOULD BE A CET1 ADD-ON TO THE CAPITAL

CONSERVATION BUFFER IN THE RANGE OF 0% TO 2.5% WHEN FULLY

IMPLEMENTED (POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN TOTAL BUFFERS OF BETWEEN

2.5% AND 5%).

THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER IS DESIGNED TO ABSORB LOSSES

DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC STRESS. BANKING INSTITUTIONS WITH A

RATIO OF CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ABOVE THE MINIMUM BUT

BELOW THE CONSERVATION BUFFER (OR BELOW THE COMBINED CAPITAL

CONSERVATION BUFFER AND COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, WHEN THE

LATTER IS APPLIED) WILL FACE CONSTRAINTS ON DIVIDENDS, EQUITY

REPURCHASES AND COMPENSATION BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF THE

SHORTFALL.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK WILL

COMMENCE JANUARY 1, 2013. ON THAT DATE, BANKING

INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM

CAPITAL RATIOS.



3.5% CET1 TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS;



4.5% TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS; AND



8.0% TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDES FOR A NUMBER OF NEW

DEDUCTIONS FROM AND ADJUSTMENTS TO CET1. THESE INCLUDE, FOR

EXAMPLE, THE REQUIREMENT THAT MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS,

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS DEPENDENT UPON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NON-CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL ENTITIES

BE DEDUCTED FROM CET1 TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY ONE SUCH CATEGORY

EXCEEDS 10% OF CET1 OR ALL SUCH CATEGORIES IN THE AGGREGATE

EXCEED 15% OF CET1. THE AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS THAT IS NOT

DEDUCTED FROM CET1 WILL BE RISK WEIGHTED AT 250%.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO CET1

WILL BEGIN ON JANUARY 1, 2014 AND WILL BE PHASED-IN OVER A

FIVE-YEAR PERIOD (20% PER YEAR). THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER WILL BEGIN ON JANUARY 1, 2016

AT 0.625% AND BE PHASED IN OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD (INCREASING

BY THAT AMOUNT ON EACH SUBSEQUENT JANUARY 1, UNTIL IT

REACHES 2.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2019).

THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES HAVE INDICATED INFORMALLY THAT

THEY EXPECT TO PROPOSE REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING BASEL III

IN MID-2011 WITH FINAL ADOPTION OF IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS IN

MID-2012. NOTWITHSTANDING ITS RELEASE OF THE BASEL III

FRAMEWORK AS A FINAL FRAMEWORK, THE BASEL COMMITTEE IS

CONSIDERING FURTHER AMENDMENTS TO BASEL III, INCLUDING THE

IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL SURCHARGES ON GLOBALLY

SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT BELIEVE IT WILL BE CONSIDERED A GLOBALLY SYSTEMICALLY

IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE FEDERAL

BANKING AGENCIES TO ADOPT REGULATIONS AFFECTING

U.S. BANKING INSTITUTIONS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN A

NUMBER OF RESPECTS AND MANDATES THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE ADOPT

PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS) THAT ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE

APPLICABLE TO OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANIES. THE COMPANY IS A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SO IT IS CONSIDERED A SYSTEMICALLY

IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION UNDER DODD-FRANK. THE

IMPLICATIONS OF THIS DESIGNATION ON THE COMPANYS CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS ARE UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME. ACCORDINGLY, THE

REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY

DIFFERENT FROM THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK AS PUBLISHED

IN DECEMBER 2010.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIQUIDITY

RATIOS UNDER BASEL III

HISTORICALLY, REGULATION AND MONITORING OF BANK AND BANK HOLDING

COMPANY LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER,

BOTH IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, WITHOUT REQUIRED

FORMULAIC MEASURES. THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK REQUIRES

BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MEASURE THEIR LIQUIDITY

AGAINST SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY TESTS THAT, ALTHOUGH SIMILAR IN SOME

RESPECTS TO LIQUIDITY MEASURES HISTORICALLY APPLIED BY BANKS AND

REGULATORS FOR MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY PURPOSES, GOING

FORWARD WILL BE REQUIRED BY REGULATION. ONE TEST, REFERRED TO AS

THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR), IS DESIGNED TO

ENSURE THAT THE BANKING ENTITY MAINTAINS AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF

UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS EQUAL TO THE

ENTITYS EXPECTED NET CASH OUTFLOW FOR A

30-DAY

TIME

HORIZON (OR, IF GREATER, 25% OF ITS EXPECTED TOTAL CASH OUTFLOW)

UNDER AN ACUTE LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO. THE OTHER TEST,

REFERRED TO AS THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (NSFR),

IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE MORE MEDIUM-AND LONG-TERM FUNDING OF THE

ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES OF BANKING ENTITIES OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME

HORIZON. THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL INCENT BANKING ENTITIES TO

INCREASE THEIR HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND

OTHER SOVEREIGN DEBT AS A COMPONENT OF ASSETS AND INCREASE THE

USE OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS A FUNDING SOURCE. THE LCR WOULD BE

IMPLEMENTED SUBJECT TO AN OBSERVATION PERIOD BEGINNING IN 2011,

BUT WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED AS A REQUIREMENT UNTIL

JANUARY 1, 2015, AND THE NSFR WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED AS A

REQUIREMENT UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2018. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE

SUBJECT TO FURTHER RULEMAKING AND THEIR TERMS MAY CHANGE BEFORE

IMPLEMENTATION.

PROMPT

CORRECTIVE ACTION

THE FDIA REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATORS TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF

FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND

AEBFSB) THAT DO NOT MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE FDIA

SPECIFIES FIVE CAPITAL TIERS: WELL CAPITALIZED,

ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED,

UNDERCAPITALIZED, SIGNIFICANTLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND CRITICALLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CAPITAL

TIER DEPENDS UPON HOW ITS CAPITAL LEVELS COMPARE TO VARIOUS

RELEVANT CAPITAL MEASURES AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS, AS

ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION. A BANK MAY BE DEEMED TO BE IN A

CAPITALIZATION CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY ITS

ACTUAL CAPITAL POSITION IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY

EXAMINATION RATING. ONCE AN INSTITUTION BECOMES

UNDERCAPITALIZED, THE FDIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY

MORE RESTRICTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND

CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE CAPITAL CATEGORY IN

WHICH AN INSTITUTION IS CLASSIFIED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

THAT IS NOT WELL CAPITALIZED IS ALSO SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON

THE ACCEPTANCE OF BROKERED DEPOSITS INCLUDING CERTIFICATE OF

DEPOSIT ACCOUNT REGISTRY SERVICE DEPOSITS. THE MAJORITY OF THE

COMPANYS OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAVE BEEN

RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CHANNELS AND ARE CONSIDERED BROKERED

DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES. AS PART OF ITS FUNDING

STRATEGY, A MAJORITY OF THE DEPOSITS RAISED DURING 2010 WERE

SOURCED DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY WITH CONSUMERS THROUGH PERSONAL

SAVINGS FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR DEPOSIT

PROGRAMS, PLEASE SEE DEPOSIT PROGRAMS BEGINNING ON

PAGE 24 ABOVE AND DEPOSIT PROGRAMS ON

PAGE 43 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH

INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION FROM MAKING ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION (INCLUDING

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS) OR PAYING ANY MANAGEMENT FEE TO ITS

HOLDING COMPANY IF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD THEREAFTER

BE UNDERCAPITALIZED. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON BORROWING FROM THE FEDERAL

RESERVE AND TO GROWTH LIMITATIONS, AND ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A

CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN. FOR A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN TO BE

ACCEPTABLE, ANY HOLDING COMPANY MUST GUARANTEE THE CAPITAL PLAN

UP TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF 5% OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AT THE TIME IT BECAME UNDERCAPITALIZED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL DEFICIENCY AT THE TIME IT FAILS TO

COMPLY WITH THE PLAN. IN THE EVENT OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS

BANKRUPTCY, SUCH GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY OVER CLAIMS OF

ITS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS. IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

FAILS TO SUBMIT AN ACCEPTABLE PLAN, IT IS TREATED AS IF IT IS

SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED.

SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY BE

SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING

ORDERS TO SELL SUFFICIENT VOTING STOCK TO BECOME ADEQUATELY

CAPITALIZED, REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE TOTAL ASSETS AND CESSATION

OF RECEIPT OF DEPOSITS FROM CORRESPONDENT BANKS. CRITICALLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR.

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANY AND TRS AS WELL AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE

LIMITED BY BANKING STATUTES AND REGULATIONS IN THEIR ABILITY TO

PAY DIVIDENDS. IN GENERAL, FEDERAL AND APPLICABLE STATE BANKING

LAWS PROHIBIT, WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL,

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND

AEBFSB, FROM MAKING DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS IF SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS

ARE NOT PAID OUT OF AVAILABLE RECENT EARNINGS OR WOULD CAUSE THE

INSTITUTION TO FAIL TO MEET CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS. IN

ADDITION TO SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS ON THE DIVIDENDS THAT

SUBSIDIARY BANKS CAN PAY TO THEIR HOLDING COMPANIES, FEDERAL

REGULATORS COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN

UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND TRS TO SHAREHOLDERS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IT IS FEDERAL

RESERVE POLICY THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY SHOULD PAY

DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS ONLY OUT OF NET

INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND

ONLY IF THE PROSPECTIVE RATE OF EARNINGS RETENTION APPEARS

CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS CURRENT AND EXPECTED

FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY, AND OVERALL FINANCIAL

CONDITION. MOREOVER, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN

DIVIDEND LEVELS THAT PLACE UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE CAPITAL OF

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OR THAT MAY UNDERMINE THE

BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH

TO ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD PROHIBIT

A DIVIDEND BY THE COMPANY OR TRS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE

OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION

OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

UNDER TEMPORARY GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL

RESERVE IN NOVEMBER 2010, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE

COMPANY AND TRS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE

TAKING ANY ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A DIMINISHED CAPITAL

BASE, INCLUDING ACTIONS SUCH AS INCREASING DIVIDENDS. THE

FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS

CAPITAL ADEQUACY BASED ON CAPITAL PLANS AND STRESS TESTS

SUBMITTED BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY. THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL

REVIEW THE CAPITAL PLANS, INCLUDING DIVIDEND POLICIES, AGAINST,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO

ACHIEVE BASEL III CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS REFERRED TO

ABOVE AS THEY ARE PHASED IN BY U.S. REGULATORS AND ANY

POTENTIAL IMPACT OF DODD-FRANK ON THE COMPANYS RISK

PROFILE, BUSINESS STRATEGY, CORPORATE STRUCTURE OR CAPITAL

ADEQUACY. A COMPANY THAT HAS NOT ACHIEVED BASEL III CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY

INCREASING DIVIDENDS. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY

APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL

RESERVE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT, HAD REGULATIONS

IMPLEMENTING BASEL III BEEN IN PLACE DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANYS CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER

BASEL III WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.

THIS ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO

MEET THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUSIVE OF THE

CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, AS PHASED IN BY THE FEDERAL

RESERVE, THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US MAY BE

SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE BASEL III FINAL FRAMEWORK

AS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2010.

TRANSACTIONS

BETWEEN CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB AND THEIR RESPECTIVE

AFFILIATES

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING LOANS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) BETWEEN CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ON

THE ONE HAND, AND THEIR AFFILIATES (INCLUDING THE COMPANY, TRS

AND THEIR NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES), ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE SUBJECT

TO QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE LIMITATIONS, COLLATERAL

REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY STATUTE AND

FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION. EFFECTIVE JULY 21, 2012

(SUBJECT TO A SIX-MONTH EXTENSION) DODD-FRANK SIGNIFICANTLY

EXPANDS THE COVERAGE AND SCOPE OF THE LIMITATIONS ON AFFILIATE

TRANSACTIONS WITHIN A BANKING ORGANIZATION AND CHANGES THE

PROCEDURE FOR SEEKING EXEMPTIONS FROM THESE RESTRICTIONS.

TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE GENERALLY

REQUIRED TO BE MADE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS. THESE RESTRICTIONS

GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

FDIC

INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ACCEPT DEPOSITS, AND THOSE DEPOSITS

ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE

FDICS DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND (DEPOSIT INSURANCE

FUND) IS FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS ON INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS, WHICH CURRENTLY DEPEND ON THE RISK CATEGORY OF AN

INSTITUTION AND THE AMOUNT OF

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSURED DEPOSITS THAT THE INSTITUTION HOLDS. THE FDIC MAY

INCREASE OR DECREASE THE ASSESSMENT RATE SCHEDULE ON A

SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS.

AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO REBUILD THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND,

THE FDIC REQUIRED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, TO PREPAY THEIR ESTIMATED ASSESSMENTS

FOR ALL OF 2010, 2011 AND 2012 ON DECEMBER 30, 2009.

DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE FDIC TO AMEND ITS REGULATIONS TO BASE

INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS ON THE AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS

LESS THE AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY OF THE INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD (THE NEW

ASSESSMENT BASE). THE FDIC HAS APPROVED A FINAL RULE,

EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2011, THAT IMPLEMENTS THE REQUIRED

CHANGE TO THE ASSESSMENT BASE AND CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT RATE

CALCULATION FOR LARGE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2011, THE

ASSESSMENT RATES WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS BASED UPON THE

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS RATIO OF

(1) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE,

(2) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT ISSUED BY ANOTHER INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE, AND

(3) BROKERED DEPOSITS TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE. HOWEVER,

EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2011, THE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON BROKERED

DEPOSITS TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT BASE WILL NOT APPLY SO LONG AS

THE INSTITUTION IS WELL CAPITALIZED AND HAS A COMPOSITE CAMELS

RATING OF 1 OR 2. ADDITIONALLY, THE RULES PERMIT THE FDIC TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY ASSESSMENT RATE ADJUSTMENTS.

THESE CHANGES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, FUTURE CHANGES

TO DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS ALSO COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DODD-FRANK ALSO REQUIRES THE FDIC TO INCREASE THE RESERVE RATIO

FOR THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND FROM 1.15 PERCENT TO REACH A

MINIMUM OF 1.35 PERCENT OF ESTIMATED INSURED DEPOSITS BY

SEPTEMBER 30, 2020. ON DECEMBER 20, 2010, THE FDIC

ISSUED A FINAL RULE SETTING THE INCREASED RESERVE RATIO AT

2 PERCENT. THIS INCREASE WILL RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK ELIMINATES

THE CEILING (1.5 PERCENT OF INSURED DEPOSITS) ON THE SIZE

OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND AND MAKES THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS

FROM THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND BY THE FDIC DISCRETIONARY.

UNDER THE FDIA, THE FDIC MAY TERMINATE THE INSURANCE OF AN

INSTITUTIONS DEPOSITS UPON A FINDING THAT THE INSTITUTION

HAS ENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICES, IS IN AN UNSAFE OR

UNSOUND CONDITION TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS OR HAS VIOLATED ANY

APPLICABLE LAW, REGULATION, RULE, ORDER OR CONDITION IMPOSED BY

THE FDIC. WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY PRACTICE, CONDITION OR VIOLATION

THAT MIGHT LEAD TO TERMINATION OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE AT EITHER OF

OUR INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES.

FDIC

POWERS UPON INSOLVENCY OF INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS

IF THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK OR

AEBFSB, UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC

HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR

WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR

(3) TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO

WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF

WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE

DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC

TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION.

IN ADDITION, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF

U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A PRIORITY OVER OTHER GENERAL

UNSECURED CLAIMS AGAINST THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF

DEBT HOLDERS OF THE INSTITUTION AND DEPOSITORS IN

NON-U.S. OFFICES,

IN THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION BY A

RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO

REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB, THE

DEBT HOLDERS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD

RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS, IF ANYTHING, THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN

U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ORDERLY

LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY UNDER DODD-FRANK

DODD-FRANK CREATES ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY

(OLA), A RESOLUTION REGIME FOR SYSTEMICALLY

IMPORTANT NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES, UNDER WHICH THE TREASURY SECRETARY MAY APPOINT THE

FDIC AS RECEIVER TO LIQUIDATE SUCH A COMPANY IF THE COMPANY IS

IN DANGER OF DEFAULT AND PRESENTS A SYSTEMIC RISK TO

U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY. THIS DETERMINATION BY THE

TREASURY SECRETARY MUST COME AFTER SUPERMAJORITY RECOMMENDATIONS

BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC AND CONSULTATION BY THE

TREASURY SECRETARY WITH THE PRESIDENT. OLA IS SIMILAR TO THE

FDIC RESOLUTION MODEL FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, WITH CERTAIN

MODIFICATIONS TO REFLECT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS AND NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES AND TO REDUCE

DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TREATMENT OF CREDITORS CLAIMS

UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE AND IN AN OLA PROCEEDING AS

COMPARED TO DISPARITIES THAT WOULD EXIST IN THE RESOLUTION BY

THE FDIC OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND WILL FUND OLA LIQUIDATION

PROCEEDINGS THROUGH BORROWINGS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

TREASURY AND RISK-BASED ASSESSMENTS MADE, FIRST, ON ENTITIES

THAT RECEIVE MORE IN THE RESOLUTION THAN THEY WOULD HAVE

RECEIVED IN LIQUIDATION TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH EXCESS, AND

SECOND, IF NECESSARY, ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE, SUCH AS THE

COMPANY, AND ON CERTAIN OTHER NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES. IF

AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION IS TRIGGERED, THE COMPANY COULD FACE

ASSESSMENTS FOR THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE

TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF ANY SUCH FUTURE ASSESSMENTS.

UNDER THE CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION OF THE FINANCIAL

(FIRREA), INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MAY BE LIABLE TO THE FDIC WITH

RESPECT TO ANY LOSS INCURRED OR REASONABLY ANTICIPATED TO BE

INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFAULT OF, OR FDIC

ASSISTANCE TO, ANY COMMONLY CONTROLLED INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTION. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE COMMONLY CONTROLLED

OF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS REQUIRED, IN CONNECTION WITH ITS

EXAMINATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, TO ASSESS SUCH

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS RECORD IN MEETING THE CREDIT NEEDS

OF THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY THAT DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION,

INCLUDING LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. FURTHERMORE,

SUCH ASSESSMENT ALSO IS REQUIRED OF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

THAT HAS APPLIED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE

WITH OR ACQUIRE THE ASSETS OR ASSUME THE LIABILITIES OF A

FEDERALLY REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OR TO OPEN OR RELOCATE

A BRANCH OFFICE. IN THE CASE OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY APPLYING

FOR APPROVAL TO ACQUIRE A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE

FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE RECORD OF EACH SUBSIDIARY

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICANT BANK HOLDING COMPANY IN

CONSIDERING THE APPLICATION. IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED

PREVIOUSLY, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY CRA RATINGS

COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANYS AND TRS

ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES IN RELIANCE ON FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY AUTHORITY.

PRIVACY,

FAIR CREDIT REPORTING

WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP AND MAKE

AVAILABLE RELEVANT, PERSONALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THEIR

INFORMATION, AND WE GIVE THEM NOTICE REGARDING THE MEASURES WE

TAKE TO SAFEGUARD THIS INFORMATION. REGULATORY ACTIVITY IN THE

AREAS OF PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY CONTINUES TO INCREASE

WORLDWIDE, SPURRED BY ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED

CONCERNS ABOUT THE RAPID AND WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION AND USE OF

INFORMATION. OUR REGULATORY EXAMINERS, AS WELL AS OUR AUDITORS,

ARE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT OUR PRIVACY AND DATA

SECURITY/ACCESS CONTROL POLICIES AND PRACTICES ARE ADEQUATE TO

INFORM OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR DATA USES AND TO PROTECT THEIR

PERSONAL DATA.

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS NOTED ABOVE, AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO ENHANCE PAYMENT

ACCOUNT DATA SECURITY, IN 2006, WE AND SEVERAL OTHER PAYMENT

CARD NETWORKS FORMED THE PCI SSC, AN INDEPENDENT

STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE THE EVOLUTION OF THE

PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD, WHICH HELPS ORGANIZATIONS THAT

PROCESS CARD PAYMENTS TO PREVENT CREDIT/CHARGE CARD SECURITY

BREACHES AND FRAUD THROUGH INCREASED CONTROLS AROUND DATA AND

ITS EXPOSURE TO COMPROMISE.

THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) BECAME EFFECTIVE

ON JULY 1, 2001. THE GLBA REQUIRES CONSUMER NOTICE OF A

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIVACY POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND

AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE

INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL

INFORMATION TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED

EXCEPTIONS). THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS THAT

AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS, AND SEVERAL

STATES HAVE ADOPTED SUCH LEGISLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2003

CALIFORNIA ENACTED THAT STATES FINANCIAL INFORMATION

PRIVACY ACT, WHICH REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS)

OPT-IN CONSENT FROM CUSTOMERS BEFORE THEIR DATA MAY

BE DISCLOSED TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES.

IN ADDITION, VARIOUS FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND AS

MANY AS 46 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO

AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAVE ENACTED SECURITY BREACH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION

IN THE EVENT OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH. DATA BREACH LAWS ARE

ALSO BECOMING MORE PREVALENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE

WE OPERATE, INCLUDING JAPAN, MEXICO AND GERMANY. IN MANY

COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE AUTOMATIC DATA BREACH

NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE

THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION

AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE

DATA BREACHES.

BEYOND THESE DATA BREACH LAWS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE GLBAS

REQUIREMENTS TO SAFEGUARD CUSTOMER INFORMATION, AND TO A GROWING

NUMBER OF STATE LAWS (INCLUDING IN MASSACHUSETTS AND NEVADA)

THAT IMPOSE BROAD-RANGING DATA SECURITY OBLIGATIONS REGARDING

THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE DATA. IN 1995, THE

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE

95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE

PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH

DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE),

WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL

DATA TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND

ORGANIZATIONAL STEPS TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. COMPLIANCE WITH

THESE VARIOUS LAWS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER TECHNOLOGY,

ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN JULY 2010, WE

SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW BY RELEVANT EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION

AUTHORITIES OUR DRAFT BINDING CORPORATE RULES FOR PROCESSING OF

DATA WITHIN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GROUP WHICH, ONCE APPROVED,

WILL ENABLE A MORE EFFICIENT BASIS ON WHICH TO TRANSFER DATA

WITHIN OUR GROUP. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING

THE NEED FOR FURTHER CHANGES TO THE EUROPEAN UNIONS DATA

PROTECTION REGIME.

WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN

ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND OUR INTERNAL DATA PROTECTION

POLICIES, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR

IDENTITY THEFT OR OTHER FRAUD, WHILE SEEKING TO COLLECT AND USE

DATA PROPERLY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WE ALSO HAVE

UNDERTAKEN MEASURES TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO CUSTOMER

DATA BY OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR PARTNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS,

AND TO ENSURE THAT SUCH ACCESS IS LIMITED TO THE LEAST

PRIVILEGED LEVEL NECESSARY TO PERFORM THEIR JOB OR FUNCTION FOR

THE COMPANY.

THE FCRA REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY

CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER CREDIT

REPORT INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER COMPANIES. AMONG OTHER

THINGS, FCRA PLACES RESTRICTIONS (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) ON

THE SHARING AND USE OF CERTAIN PERSONAL FINANCIAL AND

CREDITWORTHINESS INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WITH AND BY OUR

AFFILIATES.

FCRA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED BY THE ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2003

OF THE FACT ACT. THE FACT ACT REQUIRES ANY COMPANY THAT RECEIVES

INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN AFFILIATE, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO PERMIT THE CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM

HAVING THAT INFORMATION USED TO MARKET THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE FEDERAL BANKING

AGENCIES ISSUED A FINAL RULE IMPLEMENTING THE AFFILIATE

MARKETING PROVISIONS OF THE FACT ACT. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO

OVERSIGHT BY THESE AGENCIES WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE

RULES BY OCTOBER 1, 2008. THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED

VARIOUS MECHANISMS TO ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS TO OPT OUT OF

AFFILIATE SHARING AND OF MARKETING BY THE COMPANY AND OUR

AFFILIATES, AND IT CONTINUES TO REVIEW AND ENHANCE THESE

MECHANISMS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND A

FAVORABLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FACT ACT FURTHER AMENDED THE FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW

PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT OR DECREASE IDENTITY THEFT AND TO

IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CONSUMER CREDIT INFORMATION. THE FEDERAL

BANKING AGENCIES AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

(FTC) PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE IN NOVEMBER 2007

REQUIRING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM

CONTAINING REASONABLE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS THE

RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IDENTIFY ACCOUNTS WHERE IDENTITY

THEFT IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY

THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ORIGINALLY WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY

WITH THE RULE BY NOVEMBER 1, 2008, BUT THE FTC SUSPENDED

ENFORCEMENT OF ITS RULE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010 PENDING

LEGISLATION TO CLARIFY THE LAWS SCOPE. ON

DECEMBER 18, 2010, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE RED FLAG

PROGRAM CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2010 INTO LAW. THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL POLICIES AND STANDARDS, AS WELL AS OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE

DATA SECURITY AND FRAUD PREVENTION PROGRAMS, COMPLY WITH THE NEW

IDENTITY THEFT REQUIREMENTS.

THE FACT ACT ALSO IMPOSES DUTIES ON BOTH CONSUMER REPORTING

AGENCIES AND ON BUSINESSES THAT FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION

CONTAINED IN CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FURNISHER

OF INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO PREVENT

THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE RESULT OF

IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO, IF A CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY OF

INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, THE

FURNISHER OF THAT INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND

RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A TIMELY FASHION. THE FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY

THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE DISPUTES REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THE

INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE FACT

ACT ALSO REQUIRES GRANTORS OF CREDIT THAT USE CONSUMER CREDIT

REPORT INFORMATION IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO OFFER A BORROWER

CREDIT ON TERMS THAT ARE MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE

THAN THE TERMS OFFERED TO MOST OF THE LENDERS OTHER

CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE BORROWER THAT THE TERMS ARE BASED ON A

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. IN SUCH A CASE THE BORROWER IS ENTITLED

TO RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING

AGENCY. THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE

ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH

RISK-BASED PRICING NOTICES MUST BE PROVIDED TO

CUSTOMERS AND THE CONTENT, FORMAT AND TIMING OF SUCH NOTICES.

DODD-FRANK WILL REQUIRE, EFFECTIVE JULY 21, 2011, THE

ADDITION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT SCORES TO

RISK-BASED PRICING NOTICES AND TO ADVERSE ACTION

NOTICES OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY THE FCRA. GRANTORS OF CREDIT USING

PRESCREENED CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN CREDIT

SOLICITATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO INCLUDE AN ENHANCED NOTICE TO

CONSUMERS THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT FROM RECEIVING

FURTHER PRESCREENED OFFERS OF CREDIT. THE ENACTMENT OF THE FACT

ACT AND THE PROMULGATION OF RULES IMPLEMENTING IT ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR

PRACTICES.

THE CARD

ACT

IN MAY 2009, THE CARD ACT WAS ENACTED TO PROHIBIT CERTAIN

PRACTICES FOR CONSUMER CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS. THE CARD ACT, AMONG

OTHER REQUIREMENTS, PROHIBITS ISSUERS FROM TREATING A PAYMENT AS

LATE FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING INCREASING THE APR OR IMPOSING A

FEE, UNLESS A CONSUMER HAS BEEN PROVIDED A REASONABLE

AMOUNT OF TIME TO MAKE THE PAYMENT. IT ALSO REQUIRES

ISSUERS TO APPLY PAYMENT AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM

PAYMENT FIRST TO THE BALANCE WITH THE HIGHEST APR AND THEN TO

BALANCES WITH LOWER APRS. IN ADDITION, THE ACT PROHIBITS AN

ISSUER FROM INCREASING THE APR ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES, EXCEPT

IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN A PROMOTIONAL RATE

EXPIRES, A VARIABLE RATE ADJUSTS, OR AN ACCOUNT IS SERIOUSLY

DELINQUENT OR COMPLETES A WORKOUT ARRANGEMENT. THESE

REQUIREMENTS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON FEBRUARY 22, 2010.

THE CARD ACT ALSO REQUIRES ISSUERS TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE

WRITTEN POLICIES TO CONSIDER A CONSUMERS INCOME OR ASSETS

AND CURRENT OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO OPENING AN ACCOUNT OR

INCREASING A CREDIT LINE. THIS REQUIRED MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR

ACCOUNT OPENING DECISIONING AND LINE INCREASE DECISIONING

PROCESSES. THIS REQUIREMENT BECAME EFFECTIVE ON

FEBRUARY 22, 2010, AND TO DATE HAS NOT HAD ANY SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THESE DECISIONS. IN ADDITION, APPLICANTS FOR NEW

ACCOUNTS WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 21 MUST DEMONSTRATE AN

INDEPENDENT ABILITY TO MAKE THE REQUIRED MINIMUM PERIODIC

PAYMENTS. ON OCTOBER 19, 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE PROPOSED

CLARIFICATIONS TO ITS RULES IMPLEMENTING THE CARD ACT, WHICH

WOULD INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT APPLICANTS WHO ARE 21 AND OVER

MUST ALSO DEMONSTRATE AN INDEPENDENT ABILITY TO MAKE THE

REQUIRED MONTHLY MINIMUM PAYMENTS. ISSUERS WOULD NOT BE

PERMITTED TO CONSIDER HOUSEHOLD INCOME OR ASSETS, BUT ONLY THE

INDIVIDUAL INCOME OR ASSETS OF THE APPLICANT. IF ADOPTED AS

PROPOSED, THIS RULE MAY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FOR

OUR CARDS THAT ARE APPROVED FOR APPLICANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE

SUFFICIENT INDIVIDUAL INCOME, EVEN

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THOUGH THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME MAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR APPROVAL.

SINCE AUGUST 22, 2010, THE CARD ACT REQUIRES THAT PENALTY

FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS

ADJUSTED PENALTY FEES (LATE FEES AND RETURNED PAYMENT FEES)

ACCORDINGLY, THIS REQUIREMENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE ANY

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ALSO, SINCE AUGUST 22, 2010, THE CARD ACT REQUIRES ISSUERS

TO PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES TO DETERMINE IF A

DECREASE IS APPROPRIATE. THE FIRST OF THESE REEVALUATIONS MUST

BE COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY 2011. THE OBLIGATION TO PERIODICALLY

REEVALUATE APR INCREASES IS ONGOING, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW

THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE INTERPRETED OR AMENDED BY THE NEW

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. THEREFORE, WHILE THE

ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THIS REQUIREMENT IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME,

IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE ALSO AMENDED ITS RULES ON THE FORMAT AND

CONTENT OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARD DISCLOSURES. THE AMENDMENTS

REQUIRED REVISIONS TO THE FORMAT AND CONTENT OF ALL MAIN TYPES

OF OPEN-END CONSUMER CREDIT DISCLOSURES, INCLUDING APPLICATIONS

AND SOLICITATIONS, ACCOUNT-OPENING DISCLOSURES, AND PERIODIC

BILLING STATEMENTS. THESE AMENDMENTS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON

JULY 1, 2010.

CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CARD ACT ALSO APPLY TO STORED VALUE

AND PREPAID PRODUCTS SOLD ON OR AFTER AUGUST 22, 2010. IN

MARCH 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AMENDED ITS REGULATION E TO

IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE DORMANCY,

INACTIVITY OR SERVICE FEES WITH RESPECT TO GIFT CERTIFICATES,

STORE GIFT CARDS AND GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS ISSUED PRIMARILY

FOR PERSONAL USE. SUCH FEES MAY ONLY BE IMPOSED UNDER CERTAIN

CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RULES PROHIBIT THE SALE OR

ISSUANCE OF A GIFT CERTIFICATE, STORE GIFT CARD OR GENERAL-USE

PREPAID CARD THAT HAS AN EXPIRATION DATE OF LESS THAN FIVE YEARS

AFTER EITHER THE DATE A CERTIFICATE OR CARD IS ISSUED OR THE

DATE ON WHICH FUNDS WERE LAST LOADED. THE RULES ALSO REQUIRE

IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO GIVE CONSUMERS A

REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE A CERTIFICATE OR CARD WITH AT

LEAST FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE CERTIFICATE OR CARD EXPIRATION DATE,

PROHIBIT ANY FEES FOR REPLACING AN EXPIRED CERTIFICATE OR CARD

OR REFUNDING THE REMAINING BALANCE AS LONG AS THE UNDERLYING

FUNDS REMAIN VALID, AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR ANY

FEE OTHER THAN A DORMANCY, INACTIVITY OR SERVICE FEE.

WHILE THE COMPANY HAS MADE CERTAIN CHANGES TO OUR PRODUCT TERMS

AND PRACTICES DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE CARD ACT, THE

LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE CARD ACT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

PRACTICES AND REVENUES WILL DEPEND UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS

STRATEGIES, CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND THE ACTIONS OF THE

COMPANYS COMPETITORS, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AT

THIS TIME. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF

THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY THE CARD ACT, IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE USA PATRIOT ACT WAS ENACTED IN OCTOBER

2001 IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST

ATTACKS. THE PATRIOT ACT, IN ADDITION TO SUBSTANTIALLY

BROADENING EXISTING AML AND TERRORIST FINANCING LEGISLATION,

AMENDED THE BANK SECRECY ACT, THE PRIMARY LEGISLATION GOVERNING

AML REQUIREMENTS. THE PATRIOT ACT CONTAINS A WIDE VARIETY OF

PROVISIONS AIMED AT FIGHTING TERRORISM AND MONEY LAUNDERING,

INCLUDING PROVISIONS AIMED AT IMPEDING TERRORISTS ABILITY

TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST

ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED

BY THE PATRIOT ACT, REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH

AML PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING, IN SOME

INSTANCES, EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING

AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS. WHILE AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS LONG

MAINTAINED AML PROGRAMS IN OUR BUSINESSES, CERTAIN OF OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC AML REGULATIONS THAT

PRESCRIBE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR COMPONENTS OF THE AML PROGRAMS.

FOR EXAMPLE, OUR GNS BUSINESS MAINTAINS A RISK-BASED PROGRAM TO

ENSURE THAT INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE CARDS OR

ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THEIR NETWORKS MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AML

CONTROLS. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A KNOW YOUR

CUSTOMER, OR DUE DILIGENCE, PROGRAM AND AN ENHANCED DUE

DILIGENCE PROGRAM, INCLUDING A PROGRAM FOR VERIFYING THE

IDENTITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS FOR APPLICABLE BUSINESSES. WE WILL

TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS OR

INITIATIVES THAT ARE ADOPTED, WHETHER IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN

OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE INDUSTRY HAS SEEN INCREASED

REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF THE AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, WITH EMPHASIS ON RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING

REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THE REQUIREMENT TO IDENTIFY AND REPORT

SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, LEADING TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND

INCREASED PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. TO MEET THIS INCREASED

SCRUTINY, WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE AML

COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. OUR AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS PRIMARILY

CONSIST OF RISK-BASED POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT ARE

REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT, DETECT AND REPORT MONEY

LAUNDERING.

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING

A NUMBER OF REGULATED BUSINESSES. WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EU

LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE

OPERATE, TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO COMPLY WITH ALL

APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING EUROPEAN UNION

DIRECTIVES APPLICABLE TO PAYMENT INSTITUTIONS, CREDIT PROVIDERS,

INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OFFICE OF

FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATION

THE UNITED STATES HAS IMPOSED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THAT AFFECT

TRANSACTIONS WITH DESIGNATED FOREIGN COUNTRIES, NATIONALS AND

OTHERS. THESE ARE TYPICALLY KNOWN AS THE OFAC RULES,

AND THEY ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

TREASURYS OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL

(OFAC). THE OFAC-ADMINISTERED SANCTIONS TAKE MANY

DIFFERENT FORMS. GENERALLY, HOWEVER, THEY CONTAIN ONE OR MORE OF

THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS: (I) RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE WITH OR

INVESTMENT IN A SANCTIONED COUNTRY, INCLUDING PROHIBITIONS

AGAINST DIRECT OR INDIRECT IMPORTS FROM AND EXPORTS TO A

SANCTIONED COUNTRY AND PROHIBITIONS ON

U.S. PERSONS ENGAGING IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

RELATING TO MAKING INVESTMENTS IN, OR PROVIDING

INVESTMENT-RELATED ADVICE OR ASSISTANCE TO, A SANCTIONED

COUNTRY; AND (II) A BLOCKING OF ASSETS IN WHICH THE

GOVERNMENT OR SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS OF THE SANCTIONED

COUNTRY HAVE AN INTEREST, BY PROHIBITING TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY

SUBJECT TO U.S. JURISDICTION (INCLUDING PROPERTY IN THE

POSSESSION OR CONTROL OF U.S. PERSONS). BLOCKED ASSETS

(E.G., PROPERTY OR BANK DEPOSITS) CANNOT BE PAID OUT, WITHDRAWN,

SET OFF OR TRANSFERRED IN ANY MANNER WITHOUT A LICENSE FROM

OFAC. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE SANCTIONS COULD HAVE SERIOUS

LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES.

COMPENSATION

PRACTICES

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE. IN JUNE 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC, THE

FDIC AND THE OTS JOINTLY ISSUED FINAL GUIDANCE ON SOUND

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES THAT APPLIES TO ALL BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS ALL INSURED

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB.

THE FINAL GUIDANCE SETS FORTH THREE KEY PRINCIPLES FOR INCENTIVE

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE THAT

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS DO NOT ENCOURAGE EXCESSIVE

RISK-TAKING AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS. THE THREE PRINCIPLES PROVIDE THAT A

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

SHOULD PROVIDE INCENTIVES THAT APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND

FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES

TO EXPOSE THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPRUDENT RISKS, BE COMPATIBLE

WITH EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT, AND BE

SUPPORTED BY STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, INCLUDING ACTIVE AND

EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT BY THE ORGANIZATIONS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS. ANY DEFICIENCIES IN COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF A

BANKING INSTITUTION THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE

OR OTHER BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS REVIEW

OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS COMPENSATION PRACTICES MAY BE

INCORPORATED INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISORY RATINGS,

WHICH CAN AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR PERFORM

OTHER ACTIONS. THE FINAL GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST A BANKING ORGANIZATION IF ITS

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATED RISK-MANAGEMENT

CONTROL OR GOVERNANCE PROCESSES POSE A RISK TO THE

ORGANIZATIONS SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS AND THE ORGANIZATION IS

NOT TAKING PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO CORRECT THE

DEFICIENCIES.

ADDITIONALLY, ON FEBRUARY 7, 2011, THE FDIC APPROVED A

NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK ON

INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION PRACTICES. THE PROPOSED RULE IS A

JOINT RULEMAKING BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC, THE FDIC, THE

OTS, THE SEC, THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY AND THE

NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION, WHICH EACH MUST

INDEPENDENTLY APPROVE THE PROPOSED RULE BEFORE IT IS PUBLISHED

FOR COMMENT. UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $1 BILLION OR MORE (SUCH

AS THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) WOULD BE PROHIBITED

FROM OFFERING INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT

ENCOURAGE INAPPROPRIATE RISK TAKING BY OFFERING

EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION OR

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPENSATION THAT COULD LEAD THE COMPANY TO MATERIAL FINANCIAL

LOSS. ALL COVERED INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

FEDERAL REGULATORS WITH ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO DETERMINE

COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROPOSED RULE AND ALSO TO MAINTAIN POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. ADDITIONALLY, FOR COVERED

INSTITUTIONS WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, THE PROPOSED RULE

REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST 50% OF CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION BE DEFERRED FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE

YEARS AND PROVIDES FOR THE ADJUSTMENT OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS TO

REFLECT ACTUAL LOSSES OR OTHER MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE THAT

BECOME KNOWN DURING THE DEFERRAL PERIOD. MOREOVER, THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS OF A COVERED INSTITUTION WITH AT LEAST

$50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS MUST IDENTIFY

EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE AUTHORITY TO EXPOSE AN INSTITUTION TO

SUBSTANTIAL RISK, EVALUATE AND DOCUMENT THE INCENTIVE-BASED

COMPENSATION METHODS USED TO BALANCE RISK AND FINANCIAL REWARDS

FOR THE IDENTIFIED EMPLOYEES, AND APPROVE INCENTIVE-BASED

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES AFTER

APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERING OTHER AVAILABLE METHODS FOR BALANCING

RISK AND FINANCIAL REWARDS. THE FORM AND TIMING OF ANY FINAL

RULE CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE AFFECTED BY DODD-FRANK AMENDMENTS

TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE EXCHANGE

ACT) REQUIRING A NON-BINDING

SAY-ON-PAY

VOTE TO BE PROVIDED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS AT A

SHAREHOLDERS MEETING AND A NON-BINDING SHAREHOLDER VOTE TO

BE PROVIDED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY SIX YEARS TO DETERMINE THE

FREQUENCY OF

SAY-ON-PAY

VOTES. THESE VOTES MUST BE PROVIDED AT MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

OCCURRING AFTER JANUARY 21, 2011. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK

REQUIRES PROXY STATEMENT DISCLOSURE OF COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

REQUIRING PAYMENTS TO NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS UPON A CHANGE IN

CONTROL (GOLDEN PARACHUTES) IF SHAREHOLDERS ARE

VOTING ON A MERGER OR SIMILAR TRANSACTION, AS WELL AS A SEPARATE

NON-BINDING VOTE TO APPROVE GOLDEN PARACHUTE COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN SUBJECT TO A

SAY-ON-PAY

VOTE. THE GOLDEN PARACHUTE DISCLOSURE AND VOTE IS REQUIRED IN

PROXY STATEMENTS AND OTHER SCHEDULES AND FORMS INITIALLY FILED

ON OR AFTER APRIL 25, 2011.

THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THESE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ON

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ARE LIKELY

TO CONTINUE EVOLVING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED

AT THIS TIME WHETHER COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH POLICIES AND

REGULATIONS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF AMERICAN

EXPRESS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO HIRE, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE ITS

AND THEIR KEY EMPLOYEES.

FOREIGN

CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX

INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE

FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (THE FCPA) AND LOCAL

LAWS THAT PROHIBIT THE MAKING OR OFFERING OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS

TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, POLITICAL PARTIES OR POLITICAL

PARTY OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING

BUSINESS OR AN IMPROPER ADVANTAGE. THE ANTI-CORRUPTION

PROVISIONS OF THE FCPA ARE ENFORCED BY DOJ. THE FCPA ALSO

REQUIRES US TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH CERTAIN ACCOUNTING AND

INTERNAL CONTROLS STANDARDS ENFORCED BY THE SEC. IN RECENT

YEARS, DOJ AND SEC ENFORCEMENT OF THE FCPA HAS BECOME MORE

INTENSE. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE FCPA AND OTHER LAWS CAN

EXPOSE US AND/OR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES TO POTENTIALLY SEVERE

CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES. THE RISK MAY BE GREATER WHEN WE

TRANSACT BUSINESS, WHETHER THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES OR JOINT

VENTURES OR OTHER PARTNERSHIPS, IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER

PERCEIVED LEVELS OF CORRUPTION. WE HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

DESIGNED TO DETECT AND DETER PROHIBITED PRACTICES, PROVIDE

SPECIALIZED TRAINING, MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS AND PAYMENTS

GLOBALLY, AND INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPRIETIES RELATING

TO TRANSACTIONS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED. HOWEVER, IF OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS FAIL

TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS GOVERNING OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, MAY

FACE INVESTIGATIONS OR PROSECUTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

FOREIGN

OPERATIONS

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM THE USE OF

OUR CARD PRODUCTS, TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND

CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE BY

GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SEE NOTE 25 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON

PAGES 114-116

OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND WHICH IS

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.)

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR REVENUES CAN BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF

OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS SPENDING

OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY

CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN OTHER THAN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCY,

AND FOR THE REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE

SALES). SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL

CARDMEMBERS CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE

PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF THE CARD IN CONNECTION WITH

SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE

POSSIBILITY THAT, BECAUSE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS,

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE

U.S. DOLLAR MAY BE REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESS THAN

THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY

RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE PURCHASE BY

CARDMEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE

CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A

TRAVELERS CHEQUE DENOMINATED IN A SECOND CURRENCY; AND, IN MOST

INSTANCES, INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS,

UNLESS PROPERLY MONITORED AND MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOW WE MANAGE

(A)

THE INCREASE IN IMPAIRED LOANS WAS DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF NEW

GAAP EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, WHICH RESULTED IN THE

CONSOLIDATION OF THE LENDING TRUST AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACCOUNTING POLICIES ON PAGE 72 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT.

AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES, AMOUNTS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2010 INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES FOR BOTH THE CHARGE

TRUST AND LENDING TRUST; CORRESPONDINGLY, AMOUNTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009 ONLY INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND

RECEIVABLES FOR THE CHARGE TRUST AND THE SELLERS INTEREST

PORTION OF THE LENDING TRUST. AMOUNTS AS OF BOTH BALANCE SHEET

DATES ALSO INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED

WITH OTHER NON-SECURITIZED PORTFOLIOS.

(B)

THE COMPANYS POLICY IS GENERALLY TO CEASE ACCRUING

INTEREST INCOME ONCE A RELATED CARDMEMBER LOAN IS 180 DAYS

PAST DUE AT WHICH TIME THE CARDMEMBER LOAN IS WRITTEN OFF. THE

COMPANY ESTABLISHES LOAN LOSS RESERVES FOR ESTIMATED

UNCOLLECTIBLE INTEREST RECEIVABLE BALANCES PRIOR TO WRITE-OFF.

BEGINNING WITH 2009, CERTAIN CARDMEMBER LOANS PLACED WITH

OUTSIDE COLLECTION AGENCIES ARE PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS.

(C)

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THESE AMOUNTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE

CERTAIN CARDMEMBER LOANS PLACED WITH OUTSIDE COLLECTION

AGENCIES. NON-ACCRUAL LOANS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005

INCLUDED A SINGLE LOAN TO A U.S. COMMERCIAL AIRLINE OF

APPROXIMATELY $104 MILLION AND $266 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS PAID OFF IN FULL DURING THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2007. THE LOAN WAS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS IN THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2005.

(D)

REPRESENTS LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM MODIFICATION PROGRAMS OR

TDRS, WHEREIN THE TERMS OF A LOAN OR RECEIVABLE HAVE BEEN

MODIFIED FOR CARDMEMBERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES AND A CONCESSION HAS BEEN GRANTED TO THE BORROWER.

THE COMPANY MAY MODIFY CARDMEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES AND SUCH

MODIFICATIONS MAY INCLUDE REDUCING THE INTEREST RATE/DELINQUENCY

FEES ON THE LOANS AND RECEIVABLES AND/OR PLACING THE CARDMEMBER

ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN NOT EXCEEDING 60 MONTHS. IF THE

CARDMEMBER DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED TERMS, THEN THE

LOAN OR RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT REVERTS BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL TERMS.

(E)

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN MADE

TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

THIS DISCLOSURE PRESENTS OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS AS WELL AS SPECIFIC

POSSIBLE CREDIT PROBLEMS OF BORROWERS CAUSES MANAGEMENT TO HAVE

SERIOUS DOUBTS AS TO THE ABILITY OF SUCH BORROWERS TO COMPLY

WITH THE PRESENT REPAYMENT TERMS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE

COMPANY DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEM LOANS OR

RECEIVABLES WITHIN THE CARDMEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES

CROSS-BORDER

OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS (FFIEC)

GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. THE

COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE FFIEC GUIDELINES FOR ITS CROSS-BORDER

DISCLOSURE STARTING WITH 2009 REPORTING.

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND GUIDE 3 GUIDELINES

FOR REPORTING CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE ARE.

I) AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE REPORTED BASED ON AMORTIZED COST FOR

FFIEC INSTEAD OF FAIR VALUE FOR GUIDE 3; II) NET LOCAL

COUNTRY CLAIMS ARE REDUCED BY LOCAL COUNTRY LIABILITIES

(REGARDLESS OF CURRENCY DENOMINATION) EXCLUDING ANY DEBT THAT IS

FUNDING THE LOCAL ASSETS THROUGH A FOREIGN DOMICILED SUBSIDIARY

FOR FFIEC COMPARED TO GUIDE 3 WHERE ONLY AMOUNTS IN THE SAME

CURRENCIES ARE OFFSET AND SUCH DEBT NOTED ABOVE IS A REDUCTION

TO LOCAL COUNTRY CLAIMS; III) THE FFIEC METHODOLOGY

INCLUDES

MARK-TO-MARKET

EXPOSURES OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS WHICH ARE EXCLUDED UNDER GUIDE 3;

AND IV) INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE

INCLUDED UNDER FFIEC BUT EXCLUDED UNDER GUIDE 3.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS FROM BORROWERS OR COUNTERPARTIES FOR

EACH FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT EXCEEDS 1 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED

TOTAL ASSETS FOR ANY OF THE PERIODS REPORTED BELOW. CROSS-BORDER

OUTSTANDINGS INCLUDE LOANS, RECEIVABLES, INTEREST-BEARING

DEPOSITS WITH OTHER BANKS, OTHER INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS

AND OTHER MONETARY ASSETS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN EITHER DOLLARS

OR OTHER NON-LOCAL CURRENCY.

THE TABLE SEPARATELY PRESENTS THE AMOUNTS OF CROSS-BORDER

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY REVISED ITS METHOD OF

REPORTING THE CARDMEMBER LENDING NET WRITE-OFF RATE.

HISTORICALLY, THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE HAS BEEN PRESENTED USING

NET WRITE-OFF AMOUNTS FOR PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND FEES.

HOWEVER, INDUSTRY CONVENTION IS GENERALLY TO INCLUDE ONLY THE

NET WRITE-OFFS RELATED TO PRINCIPAL IN WRITE-OFF RATE

DISCLOSURES. THE WRITE-OFF RATE FOR 2010, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 IS

A PRINCIPAL ONLY WRITE-OFF RATE CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY

CONVENTION. THE WRITE-OFF RATE FOR 2006 REFLECTS PRINCIPAL ONLY

WRITE-OFFS IN THE U.S. AND TOTAL WRITE-OFFS (PRINCIPAL,

INTEREST, AND FEES) OUTSIDE THE U.S. AS PRINCIPAL ONLY WRITE-OFF

INFORMATION WAS NOT AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE U.S. FOR 2006.

(B)

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY REVISED THE TIME

PERIOD IN WHICH PAST DUE CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES IN U.S. CARD

SERVICES ARE WRITTEN OFF TO 180 DAYS PAST DUE, CONSISTENT

WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY GUIDANCE. PREVIOUSLY, RECEIVABLES

WERE WRITTEN OFF WHEN 360 DAYS PAST BILLING. THE NET

WRITE-OFFS FOR 2008 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $341 MILLION

RESULTING FROM THIS WRITE-OFF METHODOLOGY CHANGE.

(C)

INCLUDES FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF WAIVED FEE RESERVES

TO A CONTRA-CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLE.

(D)

THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE PRESENTED IS ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS AND IS

BASED ON WRITE-OFFS OF PRINCIPAL AND FEES. THE U.S. CARD

ARE BASED ON MONTH END BALANCES.

GROSS AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE

DISCUSSED IN (B) ABOVE, THE COMPANY STOPPED CALCULATING THE

RISK

FACTORS

THIS SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR

COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH

OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET

FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THE

FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK

FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE

DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT

PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE

IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO

ACTUAL EVENTS OR IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE

EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF

OUR SECURITIES.

CURRENT

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS

DIFFICULT

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND ECONOMY GENERALLY,

AS WELL AS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND

ELSEWHERE, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS

IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY, BOTH IN

THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD.

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ONGOING CONCERNS OVER THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT, THE

MORTGAGE AND REAL ESTATE MARKETS, SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES, FEAR OF

A DOUBLE-DIP RECESSION AND GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES HAVE CONTRIBUTED

TO UNCERTAIN EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE MARKETS GOING

FORWARD. THESE FACTORS, COMBINED WITH STILL RELATIVELY LOW

LEVELS OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF

UNEMPLOYMENT, CONTINUE TO IMPACT GLOBAL ECONOMIES. THIS

ENVIRONMENT HAS HAD, AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE EFFECT

ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE VERY DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMER AND

BUSINESS BEHAVIOR. IF THE ECONOMY WERE TO WORSEN, CUSTOMER

BEHAVIORS COULD CHANGE FURTHER. FOR EXAMPLE, CARDMEMBERS COULD

DECIDE TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS AT ABNORMALLY HIGH

LEVELS TO REPLACE CASH EXPENDITURES.

FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING, BUSINESS INVESTMENT,

GOVERNMENT SPENDING, INTEREST RATES, THE VOLATILITY AND STRENGTH

OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INFLATION ALL AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, OUR PROFITABILITY. AN

ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER

FAMILY INCOME, LOWER CORPORATE EARNINGS, LOWER BUSINESS

INVESTMENT AND LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING IS LIKELY TO MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE

MAY CAUSE OUR EARNINGS, CREDIT METRICS AND MARGINS TO FLUCTUATE

AND DIVERGE FROM EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, WHO MAY

HAVE DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THEIR IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESS, AND MAY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES.

POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR

COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING

ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON

CONVERTIBILITY OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL

NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND

OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS

AND PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE

DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

TERRORIST ATTACKS, INTRUSION INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BY

HACKERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS MAY HAVE A

NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE

WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF

THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS

OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD

HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE,

INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE

A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR

BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS IS

LIKELY TO DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME

CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT INVOLVE

HEALTH-RELATED RISKS.

WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $5.8 BILLION OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

IN THE EVENT THAT ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES OF THESE INVESTMENT

SECURITIES WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE FROM HISTORICAL PATTERNS

DUE TO CHALLENGES IN THE ECONOMY OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) WERE TO

PERSIST OR WORSEN, WE COULD EXPERIENCE CONTINUING OR INCREASED

ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

ADVERSE

CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT

OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST

OF CAPITAL.

THE GLOBAL MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS, WHILE DEMONSTRATING

GENERALLY IMPROVED CONDITIONS, REMAIN SUSCEPTIBLE TO VOLATILITY

AND DISRUPTION, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT MARKET LIQUIDITY

CONDITIONS.

WE NEED LIQUIDITY TO PAY MERCHANTS, OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST

ON DEBT AND DIVIDENDS ON CAPITAL STOCK AND TO REPAY MATURING

LIABILITIES. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WE COULD BE FORCED TO

LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OR CURTAIL

OPERATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY ARE PAYMENTS

FROM CARDMEMBERS AND MERCHANTS, CASH FLOW FROM OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND ASSETS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF CASH OR ASSETS THAT

ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH, DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY

DISTRIBUTED DEPOSITS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS UNSECURED MEDIUM-

AND LONG-TERM NOTES AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, SECURITIZED

BORROWINGS THROUGH OUR CONDUIT FACILITY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE

DISCOUNT WINDOW AND LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING

FACILITIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION, WE ARE NOT IMMUNE

FROM PRESSURES EXPERIENCED BROADLY ACROSS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.

THE FRAGILITY OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND

REGULATORY

74

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENVIRONMENT HAVE IMPACTED FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. ALTHOUGH

THE MARKET FOR OUR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS

HAS IMPROVED, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE MARKETS WILL BE

OPEN TO US IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN

FINANCING IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT

AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON INVESTOR DEMAND. IN

ADDITION, OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION WILL BE IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY

TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES WITH RESPECT TO THE MAINTENANCE AND

GROWTH OF OUR DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTED DEPOSIT

PROGRAMS. WE ALSO WOULD HAVE LESS FLEXIBILITY IN ACCESSING THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AS A SHORT-TERM FUNDING VEHICLE IN THE

EVENT OF A DOWNGRADE IN CREDCOS SHORT-TERM DEBT RATING AND

VOLATILITY IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET GENERALLY.

IN THE EVENT THAT CURRENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING

INTERNAL SOURCES, DO NOT SATISFY OUR NEEDS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED

TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING. THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL

FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET

CONDITIONS, THE GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND CONSUMER

DEPOSITS, THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT TO THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, OUR CREDIT RATINGS (WHICH WERE DOWNGRADED IN

APRIL 2009 BY TWO OF THE MAJOR RATINGS AGENCIES), AND CREDIT

CAPACITY, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LENDERS OR DEPOSITORS

COULD DEVELOP A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF OUR LONG- OR SHORT-TERM

FINANCIAL PROSPECTS IF WE INCUR LARGE CREDIT LOSSES OR IF THE

LEVEL OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY DECREASES DUE TO AN ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN.

SIMILARLY, OUR ACCESS TO FUNDS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES OR RATING AGENCIES TAKE NEGATIVE ACTIONS AGAINST US.

WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS SINCE THE

LATTER HALF OF 2009, IF THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CHARGE CARD AND

CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS WERE TO WEAKEN THROUGH INCREASING

DELINQUENCIES AND WRITE-OFFS, OUR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT

RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR COST OF CAPITAL COULD

INCREASE. DISRUPTIONS, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL

AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL REQUIRED

TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR

ABILITY TO REPLACE, IN A TIMELY MANNER, MATURING LIABILITIES,

SATISFY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL

NECESSARY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE MAY BE FORCED TO

DELAY RAISING CAPITAL OR BEAR AN UNATTRACTIVE COST TO RAISE

CAPITAL, WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. IF LEVELS OF MARKET DISRUPTION AND

VOLATILITY WORSEN, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT

EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE EFFECT, WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL, ON OUR

ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE

FINANCIAL REVIEW  FUNDING PROGRAMS AND

ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 42-46 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT

TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE.

WE CAN

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ROUTINE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOUNDNESS OF

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES

INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING,

COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE

TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND

INSURANCE COMPANIES. DEFAULTS OR NON-PERFORMANCE BY, OR EVEN

RUMORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT, ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INSTITUTIONS, OR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, HAVE

LED TO MARKET-WIDE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND COULD LEAD TO LOSSES

OR DEFAULTS BY ONE OR MORE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH, IN

TURN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ANY

REDUCTION IN THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING FROM, AND

RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO, THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM

DEBT IS CURRENTLY RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING

AGENCIES, THE RATINGS OF THAT DEBT WERE DOWNGRADED DURING THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 BY MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES

(MOODYS) AND STANDARD & POORS

(S&P), TWO OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. THE

RATING AGENCIES REGULARLY EVALUATE THE COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR RATINGS OF THE COMPANYS AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT ARE BASED ON A

NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS

FACTORS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THEIR CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDITIONS

AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GENERALLY, AND THE WIDER STATE OF THE ECONOMY. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL MAINTAIN

THEIR CURRENT RESPECTIVE RATINGS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THOSE

RATINGS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO

THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER

TERMS UPON WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ABLE TO

OBTAIN FUNDING.

THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TO OBTAIN

NECESSARY CREDIT RATINGS FOR THEIR ISSUANCES HAS HISTORICALLY

BEEN BASED, IN PART, ON QUALIFICATION UNDER THE FDICS SAFE

HARBOR RULE FOR ASSETS TRANSFERRED IN SECURITIZATIONS. IN 2009

AND 2010, THE FDIC ISSUED A SERIES OF CHANGES TO ITS SAFE HARBOR

RULE, WITH ITS NEW FINAL RULE FOR ITS SECURITIZATION SAFE

HARBOR, ISSUED IN 2010, REQUIRING ISSUERS TO COMPLY WITH A NEW

SET OF REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE SAFE HARBOR.

ISSUANCES OUT OF OUR AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT ACCOUNT MASTER

TRUST ARE GRANDFATHERED UNDER THE NEW FDIC FINAL

RULE. THE TRUST FOR THE COMPANYS CARDMEMBER CHARGE

RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION (THE CHARGE TRUST) DOES

NOT SATISFY THE CRITERIA REQUIRED TO BE COVERED BY THE

FDICS NEW SAFE HARBOR RULE, NOR DID IT MEET THE

REQUIREMENTS TO BE COVERED BY THE SAFE HARBOR RULE EXISTING

PRIOR TO 2009. IT WAS STRUCTURED AND CONTINUES TO BE STRUCTURED

SUCH THAT THE FINANCIAL ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO THE CHARGE TRUST

WOULD NOT BE DEEMED TO BE PROPERTY OF THE ORIGINATING BANKS IN

THE EVENT THE FDIC IS APPOINTED AS A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR OF

THE ORIGINATING BANKS. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED CONFIRMATION

FROM MOODYS, S&P AND FITCH RATINGS, WHICH RATE

ISSUANCES FROM THE CHARGE TRUST, THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO RATE

ISSUANCES FROM THE CHARGE TRUST IN THE SAME MANNER AS THEY HAVE

HISTORICALLY, EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS

TO BE COVERED BY THE FDICS SAFE HARBOR RULE. NEVERTHELESS,

ONE OR MORE OF THE RATING AGENCIES MAY ULTIMATELY CONCLUDE THAT

IN THE ABSENCE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE SAFE HARBOR RULE, THE

HIGHEST RATING A CHARGE TRUST SECURITY COULD RECEIVE WOULD BE

BASED ON THE ORIGINATING BANKS UNSECURED DEBT RATING. IF

ONE OR MORE RATING AGENCIES COME TO THIS CONCLUSION, IT COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS CAPACITY AND COST OF USING

ITS CHARGE TRUST AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS BUSINESS.

WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ACTIONS RATING AGENCIES MAY TAKE. AS WITH

OTHER COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, THE

COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES RATINGS COULD BE

DOWNGRADED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BY ANY OF THE

RATING AGENCIES.

ADVERSE

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD

DECREASE REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.

DURING 2010, OVER 33% OF OUR REVENUE NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WAS

GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE

EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE

FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE

TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE

INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT

TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT

THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO

U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LEGAL AND

REGULATORY RISKS

ONGOING

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING THE COMPANYS

ANTI-STEERING AND SURCHARGING-RELATED CONTRACTUAL

PROVISIONS COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO THOSE PROVISIONS THAT COULD

RESULT IN A MATERIAL LOSS OF REVENUE OR INCREASED EXPENSES,

SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY JUDGMENTS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE

COMPANYS GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND.

THE DOJ AND CERTAIN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE RECENTLY

BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGING THAT THE

PROVISIONS IN THE COMPANYS CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH

MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST

THE COMPANYS CARD PRODUCTS AT THE POINT OF SALE VIOLATE

THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE ALSO

DEFENDANTS IN THIS PROCEEDING, BUT THEY HAVE ENTERED INTO A

PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW AND

APPROVAL FOLLOWING A COMMENT PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS

A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSED CLASS

ACTIONS, FILED BY MERCHANTS THAT CHALLENGE THE COMPANYS

ANTI-STEERING PROVISIONS AS WELL AS

SURCHARGING-RELATED PROVISIONS. VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE BEEN

NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN LAWSUITS THAT INCLUDE SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS

RELATING TO THEIR ANTI-STEERING

AND/OR

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SURCHARGING-RELATED POLICIES AND RULES. A DESCRIPTION OF THESE

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS CONTAINED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BELOW. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST

THE COMPANY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY, REQUIRE IT TO CHANGE ITS MERCHANT

AGREEMENTS IN A WAY THAT COULD EXPOSE THE COMPANYS CARD

PRODUCTS TO STEERING OR OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AT THE

POINT OF SALE THAT WOULD IMPAIR OUR CARDMEMBERS

EXPERIENCE, RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY

DAMAGES

AND/OR

DAMAGE THE COMPANYS GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND. EVEN IF

THE COMPANY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO CHANGE ITS MERCHANT AGREEMENTS,

CHANGES IN VISA AND MASTERCARDS POLICIES OR PRACTICES AS A

RESULT OF ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD

SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO MARKET PRESSURES THAT COULD MATERIALLY

AND ADVERSELY IMPACT ITS PROFITABILITY.

THE

DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MAY

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN JULY 2010, PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED INTO LAW DODD-FRANK.

DODD-FRANK, AS WELL AS REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER, COULD

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY, FOR

EXAMPLE, REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES,

REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO COMPLY WITH MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL,

LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS, LIMITING THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES,

IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COMPANY (INCLUDING INCREASED

COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INCREASED COSTS OF FUNDING RAISED THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), LIMITING THE FEES THE

COMPANY CAN CHARGE FOR SERVICES AND IMPACTING THE VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS. A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF

DODD-FRANK AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IS

CONTAINED IN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

DODD-FRANK WILL RESULT IN INCREASED SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT OF

CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU WITHIN

THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE BUREAU WILL HAVE BROAD RULEMAKING AND

ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS AND

PAYMENT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND AUTHORITY TO PREVENT

UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE PRACTICES. THE BUREAU

WILL WRITE REGULATIONS UNDER FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL

PROTECTION LAWS, AND ENFORCE THOSE LAWS AGAINST AND EXAMINE

LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB

FOR COMPLIANCE. THE BUREAU WILL COLLECT FINES AND PROVIDE

CONSUMER RESTITUTION IN THE EVENT OF VIOLATIONS, ENGAGE IN

CONSUMER FINANCIAL EDUCATION, TRACK CONSUMER COMPLAINTS, REQUEST

DATA AND PROMOTE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO

UNDERSERVED CONSUMERS AND COMMUNITIES. DEPENDING ON HOW THE

BUREAU FUNCTIONS AND ITS AREAS OF FOCUS, IT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION TO

INCREASING OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS AND POTENTIALLY DELAYING OUR

ABILITY TO RESPOND TO MARKETPLACE CHANGES, THIS COULD RESULT IN

REQUIREMENTS TO ALTER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WOULD MAKE

OUR PRODUCTS LESS ATTRACTIVE TO CONSUMERS AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY

TO OFFER THEM PROFITABLY. THE IMPACT THIS NEW REGULATORY REGIME

WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS

TIME AND WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIMING OF THE

BUREAUS ASSUMPTION OF ITS AUTHORITY FROM OTHER

GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR BY

JULY 21, 2011.

UNDER DODD-FRANK, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS AUTHORIZED TO REGULATE

INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED BY PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A PERSON USES A DEBIT OR GENERAL-USE

PREPAID CARD, AND TO ENFORCE A NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT

SUCH FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE ACTUAL COST OF A

TRANSACTION TO THE ISSUER, WITH SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR THE

COSTS OF FRAUD PREVENTION, AS WELL AS TO PROHIBIT EXCLUSIVE

NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM

RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO

ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH

AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFERS

DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER.

FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE

STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL

PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY

DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO

ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR

CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT

DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ALSO ARE PERMITTED

TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED

THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FOR MORE

IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE RISK FACTORS-



DODD-FRANK MANDATES THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ESTABLISH HEIGHTENED

CAPITAL, LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS, RISK MANAGEMENT

REQUIREMENTS, CONCENTRATION LIMITS ON CREDIT EXPOSURES,

LIVING WILLS AND STRESS TESTS FOR, AMONG OTHERS,

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE GREATER THAN $50 BILLION

IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION,

MOST INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE

EXCHANGE-TRADED WHICH MAY INCREASE COLLATERAL POSTING

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPANY.

PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, THE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY OF THE

OTS TO SUPERVISE FEDERAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS, INCLUDING AEBFSB,

WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE OCC ON JULY 21, 2011 (UNLESS

EXTENDED FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS). AEBFSB WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A

RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS NEW REGULATOR, AND THERE COULD BE

ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALIGNING

AEBFSBS CURRENT COMPLIANCE STRUCTURE WITH THE OCCS

EXPECTATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM

THE OTS TO THE OCC COULD RESULT IN NEW REGULATORY STANDARDS AS

IT IS, AT THIS TIME, UNCLEAR WHETHER THE OCC WILL ADOPT OR

MODIFY OTS REGULATIONS, ORDERS OR POLICIES, INCLUDING

INTERPRETATIONS OR APPLICATIONS. ANY SHIFTS IN CURRENT

REGULATORY POSITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATION.

MANY PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK, INCLUDING NUMEROUS PROVISIONS NOT

DESCRIBED ABOVE, REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF RULES TO IMPLEMENT. IN

ADDITION, DODD-FRANK MANDATES MULTIPLE STUDIES, WHICH COULD

RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION.

THEREFORE, THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DODD-FRANK AND ITS

IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REMAIN UNCERTAIN.

THE

CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF

2009 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE CARD ACT REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO

MANY OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING MARKETING,

UNDERWRITING, PRICING AND BILLING. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CARD

ACT PROHIBITS AN ISSUER FROM INCREASING THE APR ON OUTSTANDING

BALANCES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS), REQUIRES ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT

DISCLOSURES, PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ACCOUNT TERMS, AND RESTRICTS PENALTY FEES

AND CHARGES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY AN ISSUER. MOST OF THE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE CARD ACT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN FEBRUARY 2010.

ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO REGULATION Z REVISING THE OPEN-END

CREDIT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1,

2010.

SINCE AUGUST 22, 2010, THE CARD ACT, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

REQUIRES THAT PENALTY FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL. ALSO,

SINCE AUGUST 22, 2010, THE CARD ACT REQUIRES ISSUERS TO

PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE APR INCREASES TO DETERMINE IF A DECREASE

IS APPROPRIATE. THE FIRST OF THESE REEVALUATIONS MUST BE

COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY 2011. THE OBLIGATION TO PERIODICALLY

REEVALUATE APR INCREASES IS ONGOING, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW

THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE INTERPRETED OR AMENDED BY THE NEW

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. THEREFORE, WHILE THE

ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THIS REQUIREMENT IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME,

IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WHILE THE COMPANY HAS MADE CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS PRODUCT TERMS

AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE

CHANGES REQUIRED BY THE CARD ACT, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT IT

WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE CARD ACT ON THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES AND REVENUES WILL DEPEND UPON

A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY

IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS STRATEGIES, CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND THE

ACTIONS OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT

TO PREDICT AT THIS TIME. IN THE EVENT THE ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY

THE COMPANY TO DATE TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF THE NEW LEGISLATION

AND REGULATIONS ARE NOT ULTIMATELY EFFECTIVE, THEY COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS REVENUE AND NET INCOME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH

BECAME BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND ELECTED TO

BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS

A RESULT OF BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT

LIMITATION, CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL REGULATION AT THE HOLDING

COMPANY LEVEL, MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT

STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TWO U.S. DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR NON-BANKING ACTIVITIES

UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVES REGULATIONS.

IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND

SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, BOTH AS A

PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND OTHERWISE.

BANKING REGULATIONS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROTECT

DEPOSITORS FUNDS, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS AND THE

BANKING SYSTEM AS A WHOLE, AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR

SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS A RESULT OF

REGULATORS ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE

FINED, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR

BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR EMPLOYEES. THERE IS ALSO THE

RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF

EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE

IMPOSED WHICH COULD IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF

ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES OR ALTER ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CUSTOMERS, AFFECT RETENTION OF KEY COMPANY PERSONNEL, OR EXPOSE

THE COMPANY TO ADDITIONAL COSTS (INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE

COSTS). SUCH CHANGES ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES

AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

PLEASE SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BEGINNING ON

PAGE 38 FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATION TO WHICH

WE ARE SUBJECT.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND, IF WE FAIL TO MEET

THESE GUIDELINES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

UNDER REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND OTHER

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR SUBSIDIARY

BANKS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MUST MEET GUIDELINES FOR

CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LEVERAGE RATIOS THAT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE

MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET

ITEMS, SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY REGULATORS ABOUT

COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. AS DISCUSSED

ABOVE UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  CAPITAL

ADEQUACY, THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE

COMPANY AND TRS AS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND OUR SUBSIDIARY

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING

SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

TRANSITION TO BASEL II AND AS A RESULT OF BASEL III

AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF DODD-FRANK. IF THE COMPANY, TRS OR OUR

SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FAIL TO MEET CURRENT OR

FUTURE MINIMUM CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR OTHER FINANCIAL

REQUIREMENTS, THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS WOULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN LIGHT OF RECENT MARKET EVENTS,

DODD-FRANK AND BASEL III, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR SUBSIDIARY

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY ADDITIONAL,

MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS THAN IN THE PAST. WE

CANNOT FULLY PREDICT THE FINAL FORM OF, OR THE EFFECTS OF, THESE

REGULATIONS. FAILURE BY ANY OF THE COMPANY, TRS OR A SUBSIDIARY

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO MAINTAIN ITS RESPECTIVE STATUS AS

WELL CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED, IF

UNREMEDIED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, WOULD CAUSE US TO LOSE OUR

STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND COULD COMPROMISE OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CAPITAL ADEQUACY

REQUIREMENTS, PLEASE SEE SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION  CAPITAL ADEQUACY ABOVE.

79

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS

AND REPURCHASE OUR CAPITAL STOCK.

WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS BY OUR REGULATORS

WHO COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN UNSAFE

OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS THE POLICY OF

THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY

PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF EARNINGS, AND ONLY IF

PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

ORGANIZATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY, AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION. RECENTLY ISSUED TEMPORARY GUIDANCE FROM THE

FEDERAL RESERVE STATES THAT OUR DIVIDEND POLICIES WILL BE

ASSESSED AGAINST, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE

BASEL III CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS. A COMPANY THAT HAS

NOT ACHIEVED BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON A FULLY

PHASED-IN BASIS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY INCREASING DIVIDENDS.

WHILE THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY WILL

BE DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES

THAT, HAD REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING BASEL III BEEN IN PLACE

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMPANYS CAPITAL

RATIOS UNDER BASEL III WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM

REQUIREMENTS. THIS ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. WHILE WE

EXPECT TO MEET THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS,

INCLUSIVE OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, AS PHASED IN BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY APPLICABLE TO US

MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE BASEL III FINAL

FRAMEWORK AS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2010. MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE WILL CLOSELY SCRUTINIZE ANY DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS

EXCEEDING 30% OF AFTER-TAX NET INCOME.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, WE REPURCHASED

14 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH OUR SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ON JANUARY 7, 2011, WE SUBMITTED OUR

COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL PLAN (CCP) TO THE FEDERAL

RESERVE REQUESTING APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH ADDITIONAL SHARE

REPURCHASES IN 2011. THE CCP INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE

AND CAPITAL AVAILABILITY UNDER CERTAIN ADVERSE ECONOMIC

ASSUMPTIONS. WE EXPECT A RESPONSE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BY

THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER. NO ADDITIONAL SHARES ARE EXPECTED

TO BE REPURCHASED PRIOR TO ITS RESPONSE. WE CANNOT PREDICT

WHETHER THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL APPROVE ADDITIONAL SHARE

PURCHASES.

CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE

SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE

COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY AND LEAD TO

DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND REVENUES THROUGH OUR

NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS

INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH

OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT

BANKING AND CARD ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS

A PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT

YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE

BANK SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS. INCREASED

REGULATORY FOCUS IN THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL

OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES

IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES

OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE

AND CREDIT CARDS. IN ADDITION, THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN

ECONOMIC AREA HAVE NOW IMPLEMENTED A RELATIVELY NEW EUROPEAN

UNION LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVE, CALLED THE PAYMENT SERVICES

DIRECTIVE, FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS,

THAT PUTS IN PLACE A COMMON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LICENSING AND

SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD

ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF

BUSINESS.

VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES AND LEGISLATURES ARE ALSO

CONSIDERING REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COVERING IDENTITY THEFT,

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY, AND

MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO

INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THESE NEW

REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD

DECREASE

80

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS

AND LEGISLATION COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO

OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR

ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED VALUE CARDS,

WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND

REVENUE GROWTH.

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION

OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD

ISSUERS AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS.

REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND,

ITALY, SWITZERLAND, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA,

BRAZIL, MEXICO AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED

INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING, CONCLUDED OR ON APPEAL.

THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY

THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN

FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND

MASTERCARD, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT

SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR BANKCARD DEBIT AND

CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE INTERCHANGE FEES.

ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA

AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS AND ON THEIR

OPERATIONS ON A MULTILATERAL BASIS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND

GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING TO MERCHANT PRICING COULD

ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE

AND/OR

MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR

OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR

INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR

ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, CONGRESS CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON THE

INTERCHANGE ISSUE DURING 2010. CONGRESS PASSED DODD-FRANK, WHICH

THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW IN JULY 2010. DODD-FRANK GIVES THE

FEDERAL RESERVE THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH RULES REGARDING

INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED BY PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A PERSON USES A DEBIT OR GENERAL-USE

PREPAID CARD, AND TO ENFORCE A NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT

SUCH FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE ACTUAL COST OF A

TRANSACTION TO THE ISSUER, WITH SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR THE

COSTS OF FRAUD PREVENTION, AS WELL AS TO PROHIBIT EXCLUSIVE

NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS DOES NOT OFFER A DEBIT CARD LINKED TO A DEPOSIT

ACCOUNT, BUT DOES ISSUE VARIOUS TYPES OF PREPAID CARDS.

RELOADABLE GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS, BUT NOT THOSE MARKETED OR

LABELED AS GIFT CARDS OR GIFT CERTIFICATES, ARE EXEMPT FROM THE

INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO THE INTERCHANGE FEE

LIMITATIONS, ALL PREPAID CARDS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE

NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED A NOTICE OF

PROPOSED RULEMAKING REQUESTING COMMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE

INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING

RESTRICTIONS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST ISSUE FINAL RULES ON THE

EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS BY JULY 21, 2011.

THE STATUTE DOES NOT SPECIFY WHEN THOSE RULES MUST TAKE EFFECT.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AT THIS TIME THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE

FINAL REGULATIONS, ONCE ISSUED, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM

RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO

ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH

AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFERS

DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER.

FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE

STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL

PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY

DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO

ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR

CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT

DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED

TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED

THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A

RESULT OF THESE NEW LAWS, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY

MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD

PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT, SUCH AS DEBIT, WHICH COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS, A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED IN

INDIVIDUAL STATE LEGISLATURES SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT

CARD INTERCHANGE FEES OR TO PROHIBIT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FROM

CHARGING A MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE SALES TAX PORTION OF CREDIT

CARD PURCHASES. OTHER PROPOSALS WERE AIMED AT INCREASING THE

TRANSPARENCY OF CARD NETWORK RULES FOR MERCHANTS. IN ADDITION, A

NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH MERCHANT LIABILITY

FOR THE COSTS OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH OF A MERCHANTS

SYSTEM OR REQUIRE MERCHANTS TO ADOPT TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS TO

PROTECT SENSITIVE CARDHOLDER PAYMENT INFORMATION. IN 2010,

VERMONT ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SET A

MINIMUM DOLLAR VALUE OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ANY

FORM OF

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PAYMENT; PERMITS MERCHANTS TO PROVIDE DISCOUNTS OR OTHER

BENEFITS BASED ON THE FORM OF PAYMENT (I.E., CARD, CASH, CHECK,

DEBIT CARD, STORED-VALUE CARD, CHARGE CARD OR CREDIT CARD); AND

PERMITS MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT THE CARDS OF A PAYMENT SYSTEM AT ONE

OR MORE OF ITS LOCATIONS BUT NOT AT OTHERS. THIS LEGISLATION MAY

SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER STATES. IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL

LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE OR

MERCHANT FEES CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OR STATE DATA SECURITY

LEGISLATION IS ADOPTED, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON OUR COMPANY, SUCH AS IN CONNECTION

WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE

COSTS OR RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR

NETWORKS OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUES FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS,

WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IF WE

ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND INVEST

SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF,

TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR

REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL

CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO

CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BUSINESS PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES

ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION

PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND

COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS,

ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND

COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE

DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT

NEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL

CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR

TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR

CARDS, NETWORKS AND OTHER SERVICES. BECAUSE OF EVOLVING PAYMENTS

TECHNOLOGIES AND THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, WE MAY NOT, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, BE SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING OR MAINTAINING OUR

SHARE OF ONLINE SPENDING AND ENHANCING OUR CARDMEMBERS

DIGITAL EXPERIENCE, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE, OR

ACCESS COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY BE LIMITED BY PATENT RIGHTS THAT THIRD

PARTIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY

ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT

WE DEVELOP MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE

STANDARDS OR BY RESISTANCE FROM CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS TO SUCH

CHANGES.

WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS,

TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION.

THESE MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT

OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND A

RESULTING LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION,

COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS,

PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND COMPETITIVE

TECHNOLOGICAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND

THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RELATED LITIGATION, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT A FUTURE ASSERTION

OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST US WILL NOT CAUSE US TO LOSE

SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE, ROYALTY OR

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY

DAMAGES.

REGULATION

IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY COULD INCREASE OUR

COSTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS

ISSUED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND

DATA SECURITY/BREACH, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY

THESE REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO THE SAFEGUARDS GUIDELINES UNDER THE

GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. THE SAFEGUARDS GUIDELINES REQUIRE THAT

EACH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A

WRITTEN, COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING

SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF

THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES AND THE SENSITIVITY

OF ANY CUSTOMER INFORMATION AT ISSUE. BROAD-RANGING DATA

SECURITY LAWS THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS HAVE ALSO BEEN ADOPTED BY

VARIOUS STATES, SUCH AS MASSACHUSETTS AND NEVADA.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER

AND EMPLOYEE DATA COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND

TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY

SIGNIFICANT FINES AND PENALTIES

82

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE

OPERATE ARE ALSO EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THEIR DATA SECURITY

REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS, AS WELL AS INCREASING ENFORCEMENT

ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA. IN 1995, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND

COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF

INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND

ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE

DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN

INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL

AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. THE DATA

PROTECTION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS

REGULATING DATA PROTECTION IN EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES. AS

THESE LAWS ARE INTERPRETED THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE

WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL PRESENCE, COMPLIANCE COSTS ARE

INCREASING, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING THAT

ADEQUATE DATA SECURITY PROTECTIONS AND DATA TRANSFER MECHANISMS

ARE IN PLACE. IN JULY 2010, WE SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW BY RELEVANT

EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES OUR DRAFT BINDING CORPORATE

RULES FOR PROCESSING OF DATA WITHIN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GROUP

WHICH, ONCE APPROVED, WILL ENABLE A MORE EFFICIENT BASIS ON

WHICH TO TRANSFER DATA WITHIN OUR GROUP.

IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING ENHANCED DATA SECURITY

REQUIREMENTS, VARIOUS FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND

AS MANY AS 46 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO

AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAVE ENACTED DATA BREACH REGULATIONS AND

LAWS REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE

EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. DATA BREACH LAWS ARE ALSO BECOMING

MORE PREVALENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE OPERATE,

INCLUDING JAPAN, MEXICO AND GERMANY. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE

YET TO IMPOSE AUTOMATIC DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS,

REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT

SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO

ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE DATA BREACHES.

MANY OF THESE REGULATIONS ALSO APPLY BROADLY TO

RETAILERS/MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS; THUS, TO THE EXTENT

THEY EXPERIENCE DATA SECURITY BREACHES, THIS PRESENTS ADDITIONAL

RISKS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS AND OUR CARDMEMBERS.

IN ADDITION, FEDERAL LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS ARE INCREASINGLY

PURSUING NEW GUIDELINES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT, IF ADOPTED,

COULD FURTHER RESTRICT HOW THE COMPANY COLLECTS, USES, SHARES

AND SECURES CUSTOMER INFORMATION, WHICH COULD IMPACT SOME OF THE

COMPANYS CURRENT OR PLANNED BUSINESS INITIATIVES. FOR

EXAMPLE, A RECENT FTC REPORT, WHICH APPLIES TO A COMPANYS

COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BOTH ONLINE AND

OFFLINE, WOULD IMPOSE GREATER TRANSPARENCY, USE, DISCLOSURE AND

CONSUMER CHOICE OBLIGATIONS ON THE COMPANY, AND MAY ULTIMATELY

RESULT IN THE CREATION OF AN ONLINE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH

CONSUMERS COULD OPT OUT OF ALL ONLINE TRACKING FOR ONLINE

BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING PURPOSES. A COMPANION REPORT BY THE

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC) WOULD

REQUIRE COMPANIES TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT IN THEIR ONLINE PRIVACY

PRACTICES, AND RECOMMENDS THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL DATA

SECURITY/DATA BREACH STANDARD. BOTH THE FTC AND THE DOC ARE

EXPECTED TO RELEASE FINAL REPORTS BY THE END OF 2011.

ADDITIONALLY, TWO DRAFT PRIVACY BILLS WERE INTRODUCED IN THE

111TH CONGRESS IN THE SUMMER OF 2010, AND A NUMBER OF

FEDERAL LEGISLATORS HAVE EITHER EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR

THESE DRAFT BILLS OR HAVE INDICATED THEIR INTENT TO INTRODUCE

NEW BILLS IN THE 112TH CONGRESS. IF ADOPTED, ANY SUCH

PRIVACY BILL COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS CURRENT AND PLANNED DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY

PRACTICES, COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND BUSINESS

OPERATIONS AND COULD REDUCE REVENUES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS

INITIATIVES.

WE CONTINUE TO SEEK WAYS TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS AND COSTS

INTERNALLY BY IMPROVING OUR OWN DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY

POLICIES AND PRACTICES, AND EXTERNALLY THROUGH REGULAR

IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD AND BY PLACING

STRONG CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ON RETAILERS/MERCHANTS THAT

ACCEPT OUR CARDS, AS WELL AS ON OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND

BUSINESS PARTNERS, RELATING TO DATA SECURITY AND DATA BREACH. WE

ALSO HAVE UNDERTAKEN MEASURES TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO

CUSTOMER DATA BY EMPLOYEES AND OUR PARTNERS AND SERVICE

PROVIDERS, AND TO ENSURE THAT SUCH ACCESS IS LIMITED TO THE

LEAST PRIVILEGED LEVEL NECESSARY TO PERFORM THEIR JOB OR

FUNCTION FOR THE COMPANY. STILL, INCREASED REGULATION AND

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN THE AREAS OF DATA

PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY/BREACH MAY MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR

COSTS AND MAY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF OUR CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, OR

RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY EXPLOIT OUR CLOSED-LOOP

CAPABILITY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE PRIVACY AND DATA

SECURITY/BREACH LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT

COULD ALSO RESULT IN FINES, SANCTIONS AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL

REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.

83

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND

OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND

OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT

INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. OUR

SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND WE BELIEVE WE ARE

IN A CRITICAL PERIOD OF COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

AND PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE MARKET FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IS

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR CANDIDATES TO REPLACE OR SUCCEED MEMBERS

OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. AS FURTHER

DESCRIBED IN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

COMPENSATION PRACTICES ON PAGES 52-53, OUR

COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF OUR

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND

OVERSIGHT BY THE FDIC AND THE OTS (AND BEGINNING IN JULY 2011,

THE OCC). AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES, WHICH MAY

OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE

FDIC OR OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING

LIMITATIONS ON ANY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES PURSUANT TO

DODD-FRANK, COULD FURTHER AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND

RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. THE LOSS

OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

LITIGATION

AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES,

PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED

EXPENSES.

BUSINESSES IN THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN

SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS AND PATENT CLAIMS. MANY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED

CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN

ADDITION, WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS

BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE EVENT OF

NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US

TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS RESULTING

IN INCREASED EXPENSES AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND

OUR BRAND.

BUSINESS

RISKS

OUR

OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND

INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS

INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDES, IN

ADDITION TO CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS AND ISSUERS,

CASH, CREDIT AND ACH, AS WELL AS EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS, SUCH AS AGGREGATORS (E.G.,

PAYPAL), WIRELESS PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE

TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS

AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS.

WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD

NETWORK BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD,

WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST COUNTRIES. AS A

RESULT, OTHER CARD ISSUERS MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE

STRONG POSITION AND MARKETING AND PRICING POWER OF VISA AND

MASTERCARD.

BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL

SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY

MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF

SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE BANKING

INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH A STRONG

RELATIONSHIP WITH US BEING ACQUIRED BY AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS A

STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH A COMPETITOR, RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL

LOSS OF BUSINESS FOR US. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE

CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD

PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL

BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG ALL ISSUERS REMAINS

INTENSE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE FROM

OUR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY

DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES

THAN WE HAVE, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING AND

MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION OR

MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE

TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS. OUR COMPETITORS

MAY ALSO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS,

PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE ARE. SPENDING ON OUR CARDS COULD

BE IMPACTED BY CONSUMER USAGE OF DEBIT CARDS, AS WE DO NOT

CURRENTLY OFFER A

84

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEBIT CARD LINKED TO A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT, BUT WE DO ISSUE VARIOUS

TYPES OF PREPAID CARDS. IN FACT, THE PURCHASE VOLUME AND NUMBER

OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS

GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS.

INTERNATIONALLY, COMPETITION REMAINS FIERCE, AND AS A RESULT, WE

MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCELERATING OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES THROUGH PROPRIETARY CONSUMER, SMALL BUSINESS AND

CORPORATE PRODUCTS, GNS PARTNERS AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

VEHICLES.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY PROVIDED BY

SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WITH

SOCIAL NETWORKING, ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT

WITH EACH OTHER AND TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IN

THIS CONNECTION, TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS

SUCH AS MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ARE WORKING TO

DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS

AND MERCHANTS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO

REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH CONTINUE TO

EMERGE AND GROW, AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO

EXPAND BOTH ON-AND OFF-LINE AND ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP

ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD FURTHER REDUCE THE

RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE.

TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND

PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND IN THE ONLINE PAYMENTS

SPACE, OUR DISCOUNT REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS

TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK COULD BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. THE COMPANY HAS RECENTLY CREATED AN

ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP TO FOCUS ON THIS STRATEGIC CHALLENGE BY

GENERATING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE ON A GLOBAL BASIS,

BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, IN AREAS SUCH AS

ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS AND FEE-BASED SERVICES. WHILE

EXPANDING THE ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE

COMPANY, MANY OF THE GROWTH INITIATIVES WILL INVOLVE NEW AREAS

FOR THE COMPANY AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXECUTING OUR

STRATEGY.

REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT MAY

IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO

RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, AND PROPOSALS TO IMPOSE TAXES OR FEES ON CERTAIN

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE OR SIMILAR PROPOSALS, WHICH MAY

NOT APPLY TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

WE

FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT

THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT

FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON

HIGH REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS

MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH

REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR

CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST

SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER

MARKET PRESSURE TO REDUCE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE

OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENTIATED PAYMENT

MODELS FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS

SPACE AND THE REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT COULD POSE

CHALLENGES TO OUR TRADITIONAL PAYMENT MODEL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT

OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE. AS A PRIORITY IN 2011, WE ARE SEEKING

TO DRIVE GREATER VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS, WHICH IF NOT

SUCCESSFUL, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DISCOUNT REVENUE AND

FINANCIAL RESULTS. IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE

AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE OR ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN MERCHANT

DISCOUNT RATES ON OUR CARDS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING OVERALL VOLUME

GROWTH OR AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE, OUR REVENUES AND

PROFITABILITY COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY

NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE CARD USAGE THROUGH

OUR MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS OR TO EFFECTIVELY

CONTROL THE COSTS OF SUCH PROGRAMS, BOTH OF WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR

PROFITABILITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY

OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND

BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT

AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID

PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON

OUR

85

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID

PRODUCTS AND INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. ONE OF THE

WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER

ATTRITION AND SEEK TO CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS

TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON OUR NETWORK, BOTH IN THE

UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, IS THROUGH

OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER

BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND

EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF

MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARDMEMBER

SERVICES EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE

INSTITUTED REWARDS AND CO-BRAND PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO

OURS, AND ISSUERS MAY IN THE FUTURE INSTITUTE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

MORE ATTRACTIVE TO CARDMEMBERS THAN OUR PROGRAMS.

DURING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE RECEIVED QUARTERLY

PAYMENTS FROM EACH OF VISA AND MASTERCARD UNDER THE AGREEMENTS

THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH EACH COMPANY TO SETTLE CLAIMS MADE

AGAINST THEM IN SEPARATE ANTITRUST ACTIONS. WE RECOGNIZED

$280 MILLION ($172 MILLION AFTER-TAX) FROM VISA IN

2010 AND 2009, AND $600 MILLION ($372 MILLION

AFTER-TAX) FROM MASTERCARD IN 2010 AND 2009. OUR ABILITY TO

CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS,

AS WELL AS OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY, MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REPLACE THE PAYMENTS PROVIDED TO US UNDER

OUR SETTLEMENTS WITH MASTERCARD AND VISA ONCE THE AGGREGATE

SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL THROUGH THE SECOND AND

FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR

BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY, AND OUR

BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE

MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. OUR

ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE

CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR

LEVEL OF SERVICE, TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING

THESE MATTERS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG EXISTING AND

POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT

DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS AND MAINTAIN

EXISTING ONES. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY

MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR

RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR

LITIGATION AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR

AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE

PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

WE MAY

NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN REALIZING THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY.

WE HAVE RECENTLY ACQUIRED A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR

ACQUISITIONS OF SERVE, ACCERTIFY AND LOYALTY PARTNER, WHICH IS

PENDING. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND ENTER INTO

DISCUSSIONS REGARDING A WIDE ARRAY OF POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS.

THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING AN

ACQUIRED COMPANY, BUSINESS, OR TECHNOLOGY HAS CREATED, AND WILL

CONTINUE TO CREATE, UNFORESEEN OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND

EXPENDITURES. THE AREAS WHERE WE FACE RISKS INCLUDE.

IMPLEMENTATION OR REMEDIATION OF CONTROLS, PROCEDURES, AND

POLICIES AT THE ACQUIRED COMPANY; DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT TIME

AND FOCUS FROM OPERATING OUR BUSINESS TO ACQUISITION INTEGRATION

CHALLENGES; COORDINATION OF PRODUCT, ENGINEERING, AND SALES AND

MARKETING FUNCTIONS; TRANSITION OF OPERATIONS, USERS, AND

CUSTOMERS ONTO OUR EXISTING PLATFORMS; CULTURAL CHALLENGES

ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING EMPLOYEES FROM THE ACQUIRED COMPANY

INTO OUR ORGANIZATION; RETENTION OF EMPLOYEES FROM THE

BUSINESSES WE ACQUIRE; INTEGRATION OF THE ACQUIRED

COMPANYS ACCOUNTING, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION, HUMAN

RESOURCE, AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS; LIABILITY FOR

ACTIVITIES OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY BEFORE THE ACQUISITION,

INCLUDING PATENT AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, VIOLATIONS

OF LAWS, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, TAX LIABILITIES, AND OTHER KNOWN

AND UNKNOWN LIABILITIES; LITIGATION OR OTHER CLAIMS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUIRED COMPANY, INCLUDING CLAIMS FROM

TERMINATED EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, FORMER STOCKHOLDERS, OR OTHER

THIRD PARTIES; IN THE CASE OF FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS, THE NEED TO

INTEGRATE OPERATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT CULTURES AND LANGUAGES AND

TO ADDRESS THE PARTICULAR ECONOMIC, CURRENCY, POLITICAL, AND

REGULATORY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC COUNTRIES; AND FAILURE

TO SUCCESSFULLY FURTHER DEVELOP THE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY.

86

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE RISKS OR OTHER PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PAST OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND

INVESTMENTS COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED

BENEFITS OF SUCH ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS, INCUR

UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES, AND HARM OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY.

AN

INCREASE IN ACCOUNT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING

OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND

COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES STORE CARDMEMBER ACCOUNT INFORMATION

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. CRIMINALS ARE

USING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS

TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTS,

INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL

ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT. AS OUTSOURCING AND

SPECIALIZATION BECOME A MORE ACCEPTABLE AND COMMON WAY OF DOING

BUSINESS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES

INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS. IF DATA

BREACHES OR FRAUD LEVELS INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE, IT

COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD

REISSUANCE), INCREASED CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS RELATING TO THE

PRIVACY OF THEIR DATA AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO

OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR

CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE

HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF

INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES,

RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND ALLIANCES OF OUR PARTNERS,

AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR

PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT

TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A

VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH

COSTCO AND DELTA AIR LINES TO OFFER CO-BRANDED CARDS FOR

CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY

INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO

CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. UNDER SOME TYPES OF THESE CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS,

WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN CO-BRAND

PARTNERS, MERCHANTS, VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE

TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD

UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH

COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, WE HAVE CREDIT RISK TO CERTAIN

CO-BRAND PARTNERS RELATING TO OUR PREPAYMENTS FOR LOYALTY

PROGRAM POINTS THAT WILL NOT BE FULLY REDEEMED FOR MULTI-YEAR

PERIODS. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES,

RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY

OCCUR IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT PARTICULAR CARD

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE

COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE WERE OBLIGATED TO OR ELECTED

TO REIMBURSE CARDMEMBERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PURCHASED

FROM MERCHANTS THAT ARE BANKRUPT OR HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS.

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

BILLED BUSINESS AND IN RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES,

RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. DURING

2010, THERE CONTINUED TO BE SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION IN THE

AIRLINE INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES (E.G.,

UNITED AIRLINES/CONTINENTAL AIRLINES AND THE PENDING MERGER OF

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES AND AIRTRAN), THROUGH MERGERS

AND/OR

GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES AND JOINT

VENTURES, AND THIS TREND COULD CONTINUE. IN PARTICULAR, THE

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS GRANTED ANTITRUST

IMMUNITY TO MEMBERS OF THE SKYTEAM, STAR AND ONEWORLD ALLIANCES,

ENABLING THE COVERED AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR

CROSS-REGIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT

VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS, INCLUDING JOINTLY

PRICING AND MANAGING CAPACITY ON COVERED ROUTES, SHARING

REVENUES AND COSTS, AND COORDINATING SALES AND CORPORATE

CONTRACTS, ALL OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THE U.S. ANTITRUST

LAWS. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS SIMILARLY APPROVED THE

ONEWORLD ALLIANCE, AND ITS REVIEW OF THE OTHER ALLIANCES IS

CONTINUING. INCREASING CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANDED ANTITRUST

IMMUNITY COULD CREATE CHALLENGES FOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE

AIRLINES INCLUDING BY REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY ON OUR AIRLINE

BUSINESS.

AIRLINES ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE

PARTNERS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. IF A PARTICIPATING

AIRLINE MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE

WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION. SIMILARLY, IF ONE OF

OUR CO-BRAND

87

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AIRLINE PARTNERS MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT HAD A COMPETING

CO-BRAND CARD, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE

WHICH CO-BRAND CARDS IT WOULD OFFER. IF AN AIRLINE DETERMINED TO

WITHDRAW FROM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS OR TO CEASE OFFERING AN

AMERICAN EXPRESS CO-BRAND CARD, WHETHER AS THE RESULT OF A

MERGER OR OTHERWISE, SUCH AS OUR RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT

CONTINENTAL AIRLINES WILL NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN THE AIRPORT

CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARDMEMBERS OR

THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TRANSFER PROGRAM AS OF

OCTOBER 1, 2011, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE GENERAL RISKS RELATED

TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW 

EXPOSURE TO AIRLINE INDUSTRY ON PAGE 60 OF OUR 2010

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE.

OUR

REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE

SUCCESSFUL, AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED.

WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING, A

VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN

ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS (INCLUDING THE

REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING,

PROMOTION, REWARDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE), ENHANCE

REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATING

EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME.

THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC

MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER

COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS

TO THE INTERNET TO SAVE COSTS AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS

RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT

SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE

ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, INCLUDING THE

ABILITY OF THE GLOBAL SERVICES GROUP TO GENERATE AN ANNUALIZED

LEVEL OF GROSS EXPENSE SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY

$500 MILLION BY 2012, OR IF THE ACTIONS TAKEN ULTIMATELY

COME AT THE EXPENSE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, WE MAY NOT

REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE

INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS COULD HAVE A

NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

OUR

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE

EFFECTIVE.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT,

BUSINESS LOANS, SETTLEMENT RISK WITH REGARD TO GNS PARTNERS,

MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES, THE RATE OF BANKRUPTCIES, AND OTHER

CREDIT TRENDS THAT CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT

PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES

THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY

DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CONSUMER CREDIT RISK,

PRINCIPALLY FROM CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND OUR OTHER CONSUMER

LENDING ACTIVITIES, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM

MERCHANTS, GNS PARTNERS AND GCC CLIENTS. THIRD PARTIES MAY

DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF

LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY,

REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK.

RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN

PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE

OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN

INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND

MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR

OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES

MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION WE USE IN

MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE.

ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC

CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES

AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT

RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT

TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE

FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR

CUSTOMERS.

WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE

EXPOSED. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS

AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET

VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN

OUR CARD BUSINESS AND IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. CHANGES IN

THE INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE

VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE

PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST

WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST YIELD, AND CONSEQUENTLY

OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL.

88

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS

THAT ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK TO WHICH

WE ARE EXPOSED. LIQUIDITY RISK IS DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO

ACCESS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS

AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING

OUR LIQUIDITY RISK, WE MAY MAINTAIN TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY, WHICH

CAN BE COSTLY AND LIMIT FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, OR WE MAY BE TOO

ILLIQUID, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING A

LIQUIDITY EVENT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR

MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK, SEE ADVERSE CAPITAL AND

CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF

CAPITAL ABOVE.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE

ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT

ACHIEVING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO INADEQUATE OR FAILED

PROCESSES OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, HUMAN ERROR OR THE EXTERNAL

ENVIRONMENT (I.E., NATURAL DISASTERS) INCLUDING LOSSES DUE TO

FAILURES TO COMPLY WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OPERATIONAL RISKS

INCLUDE THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT COMPLY WITH SPECIFIC REGULATORY

OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, EXPOSING US TO FINES

AND/OR

PENALTIES AND POSSIBLY BRAND DAMAGE; EMPLOYEE ERROR OR

INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT THAT RESULTS IN A MATERIAL FINANCIAL

MISSTATEMENT; OR A FAILURE TO MONITOR AN OUTSOURCE

PARTNERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT,

RESULTING IN ECONOMIC HARM TO US.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE

TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK

MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. SEE

FINANCIAL REVIEW  RISK MANAGEMENT ON

PAGES 48-50 OF OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY,

MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR

BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK

REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECORD

PROPERLY AND VERIFY A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS,

AND THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE.

AN

INABILITY TO ACCEPT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND OR

REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR

BUSINESS.

AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING, OUR BANKING SUBSIDIARIES OFFER DEPOSITS

TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGH BROKERAGE NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO

CONSUMERS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY

$29.7 BILLION IN TOTAL CUSTOMER DEPOSITS. THE MAJORITY OF

THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAVE

BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CHANNELS AND, AS SUCH, ARE

CONSIDERED BROKERED DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES. AS

PART OF OUR FUNDING STRATEGY, A MAJORITY OF THE DEPOSITS RAISED

DURING 2010 WERE SOURCED DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY WITH CONSUMERS

THROUGH PERSONAL SAVINGS FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS. MANY OTHER

FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS ARE INCREASING THEIR USE OF DEPOSIT

FUNDING, AND AS SUCH WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION IN

THE DEPOSIT MARKETS, PARTICULARLY AS TO BROKERAGE NETWORKS. WE

CANNOT PREDICT HOW THIS INCREASED COMPETITION WILL AFFECT

DEPOSIT RENEWAL RATES, COSTS OR AVAILABILITY. IF WE ARE REQUIRED

TO OFFER HIGHER INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS,

OUR FUNDING COSTS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE

INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS ALSO IS DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS

OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES. THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK,

INCLUDING OUR BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED

DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL

MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE

SOLICITED), UNLESS (1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR

(2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM

THE FDIC. A BANK THAT IS LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED GENERALLY

MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER

DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL

RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE

BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA. AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL

OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN

GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION BY THE FDIC.

UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT SOLICIT

DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS

IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN THE MARKET

AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE

ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED

(PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE

PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO

CEASE AND

89

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE

ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN AN

UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND

BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL

CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN

ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN

RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND REQUIRE AN

UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO

SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS.

WHILE CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB WERE CONSIDERED WELL

CAPITALIZED FOR THESE PURPOSES AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THIS DEFINITION. BASEL III, WHEN

IMPLEMENTED BY THE U.S. BANKING AGENCIES AND FULLY

PHASED-IN, WILL REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BANK

SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPITAL, WITH A

GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REGULATORS

CAN ADJUST THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED AT ANY TIME

AND HAVE AUTHORITY TO PLACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR DEPOSIT

BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE INTEREST RATE WE PAY ON DEPOSITS. AN

INABILITY TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS IN THE FUTURE COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR

ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

IF OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE DISRUPTED OR WE ARE

UNABLE TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS EFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL, OUR

REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY WOULD BE MATERIALLY REDUCED.

OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS

MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF FIRE,

NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER LOSS, DISRUPTIONS IN LONG DISTANCE OR

LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACCESS, FRAUD, TERRORISM OR ACCIDENT. A

NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER PROBLEM AT OUR FACILITIES COULD

INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY

SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION

ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER FAILS TO

PROVIDE THE COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A

RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION, TERRORISM OR

ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES,

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF OUR BRANDS RELIABILITY

AND MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY.

WE

RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND

OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES.

THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

WE OPERATE A SERVICE NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD.  IN

ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE OUTSOURCE

TO THIRD-PARTY VENDORS MANY OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER

SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR GLOBAL

BUSINESSES. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THIS OUTSOURCING OCCURS IN

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN

DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE

PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY

VENDORS INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DECREASES OUR

CONTROL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF

CERTAIN OUTSOURCINGS WILL DECREASE AS THE DEMAND FOR THESE

SERVICES INCREASES AROUND THE WORLD.

OUR

BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF WEATHER AND NATURAL

DISASTERS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER

CONDITIONS AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY

DERIVES A PORTION OF ITS REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING,

ITS BUSINESS IS SENSITIVE TO DISRUPTIONS IN AIR TRAVEL AND OTHER

FORMS OF TRAVEL CAUSED BY SUCH EVENTS. SUCH DISRUPTIONS CAN

RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS UNDER TRAVEL INTERRUPTION

INSURANCE POLICIES THAT THE COMPANY OFFERS AND, IF SUCH

DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL ARE PROLONGED, THEY CAN MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OVERALL TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING. IF THE

CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) RESULT IN

WIDESPREAD OR LENGTHY DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL, THEY COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PROPERTIES

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE IN A 51-STORY,

2.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT BUILDING LOCATED IN LOWER

MANHATTAN. THIS BUILDING, WHICH IS ON LAND LEASED FROM THE

BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY FOR A TERM EXPIRING IN 2069, IS ONE

OF FOUR OFFICE BUILDINGS IN A COMPLEX KNOWN AS THE WORLD

FINANCIAL CENTER. WE HAVE A 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE

BUILDING AND BROOKFIELD FINANCIAL PROPERTIES OWNS THE REMAINING

51% INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. WE ALSO LEASE SPACE IN THE

BUILDING FROM BROOKFIELD.

OTHER OWNED OR LEASED PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS CURRENTLY INCLUDE: THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE CENTERS IN FORT LAUDERDALE,

FLORIDA; PHOENIX, ARIZONA; GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA; AND SALT

LAKE CITY, UTAH; THE AMERICAN EXPRESS DATA CENTERS IN PHOENIX,

ARIZONA AND IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA; A MULTI-BUILDING CAMPUS

HOUSING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCE CENTER IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA;

THE HEADQUARTERS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICES EUROPE LIMITED IN

LONDON, ENGLAND; THE AMEX CANADA INC. HEADQUARTERS IN MARKHAM,

ONTARIO, CANADA; AND SERVICE CENTERS LOCATED IN MEXICO CITY,

MEXICO; SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA; GURGAON, INDIA AND BRIGHTON, ENGLAND.

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS DECISION TO CONSOLIDATE LOCATIONS

WITHIN THE COMPANYS GLOBAL SERVICING NETWORK, A FACILITY

IN GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA, WILL BE CLOSED, WITH WORK

CURRENTLY HANDLED THERE BEING TRANSFERRED TO OTHER LOCATIONS IN

THE U.S. SUBJECT TO LOCAL CONSULTATIONS, THE COMPANY ALSO

PLANS TO TRANSFER WORK CURRENTLY HANDLED AT A MADRID, SPAIN,

SERVICE CENTER TO FACILITIES IN BRIGHTON, U.K., AND BUENOS

AIRES, ARGENTINA, AND SERVICE SUPPORT FOR THE JAPANESE CARD

BUSINESS FROM SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA TO JAPAN.

DURING 2004 AND 2005, WE ENGAGED IN SEVERAL SALE-LEASEBACK

TRANSACTIONS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE SOLD VARIOUS OWNED PROPERTIES

TO THIRD PARTIES AND LEASED BACK THE PROPERTIES UNDER LONG-TERM

NET LEASES WHEREBY EACH AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITY THAT LEASES BACK

THE PROPERTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATING

TO THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, UTILITIES,

OPERATING EXPENSES AND INSURANCE COSTS) IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL

RENT. THE SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS HAVE NOT MATERIALLY

IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY YEAR. GAINS RESULTING FROM

COMPLETED SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE

INITIAL TEN-YEAR LEASE PERIODS. WE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER WHETHER

SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER PROPERTIES

THAT WE CURRENTLY OWN.

GENERALLY, WE LEASE THE PREMISES WE OCCUPY IN OTHER LOCATIONS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FACILITIES WE OWN OR OCCUPY SUIT OUR NEEDS

AND ARE WELL MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF

LEGAL AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS,

CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF

THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT

HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO EACH OF THESE ACTIONS AND INTENDS TO

DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY. IN THE COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL

EXAMINATIONS, INFORMATION GATHERING REQUESTS, SUBPOENAS,

INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS

NOT A PARTY TO, NOR ARE ANY OF ITS PROPERTIES THE SUBJECT OF,

ANY PENDING LEGAL, ARBITRATION, REGULATORY OR INVESTIGATIVE

PROCEEDINGS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY

PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD AS THE PROCEEDINGS ARE RESOLVED.

CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE COMPANY ARE DESCRIBED

BELOW.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR THOSE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS

DISCLOSED BELOW AS TO WHICH A LOSS IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE IN

FUTURE PERIODS, WHETHER IN EXCESS OF A RELATED ACCRUED LIABILITY

OR WHERE THERE IS NO ACCRUED LIABILITY, AND FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY IS ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS, THE

CURRENT ESTIMATED RANGE IS ZERO TO $500 MILLION IN EXCESS

OF THE ACCRUED LIABILITY (IF ANY) RELATED TO THOSE MATTERS. THIS

AGGREGATE RANGE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF

POSSIBLE LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS AND IS BASED ON

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THIS ESTIMATED RANGE OF

POSSIBLE LOSS DOES NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANYS MAXIMUM LOSS

EXPOSURE. THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS

UNDERLYING THE ESTIMATED RANGE WILL CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND

ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE CURRENT ESTIMATE.

CORPORATE

MATTERS

DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AS REGULATORY INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD

NETWORK PRICING TO MERCHANTS AND RELATED ISSUES HAS INCREASED,

THE COMPANY HAS RESPONDED TO MANY INQUIRIES FROM BANKING AND

COMPETITION AUTHORITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IN OCTOBER 2008,

THE COMPANY RECEIVED A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND

(CID) FROM THE ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE DOJ.

PURSUANT TO THE CID, THE DOJ REQUESTED THE PRODUCTION OF

DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS

CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO MERCHANT SURCHARGING AND THAT

PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST AMERICAN EXPRESS

CARDS. THE COMPANY COOPERATED WITH THE DOJS REQUEST. THE

COMPANY HAD ALSO RECEIVED A SIMILAR CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND

FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF OHIO.

ON OCTOBER 4, 2010, THE DOJ, ALONG WITH ATTORNEYS GENERAL

FROM CONNECTICUT, IOWA, MARYLAND, MICHIGAN, MISSOURI, OHIO AND

TEXAS, FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AGAINST THE COMPANY, MASTERCARD

INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND VISA, INC., ALLEGING A VIOLATION

OF SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT. THE COMPLAINT

ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS POLICIES PROHIBITING MERCHANTS

FROM STEERING A CUSTOMER TO USE ANOTHER NETWORKS CARD,

ANOTHER TYPE OF CARD OR ANOTHER METHOD OF PAYMENT

(ANTI-STEERING AND NON-DISCRIMINATION

RULES AND CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS) VIOLATE THE ANTITRUST LAWS.

THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS PARTICIPATE IN TWO

DISTINCT MARKETS, A GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK SERVICES

MARKET, AND A GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK SERVICES

MARKET FOR MERCHANTS IN TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT

(T&E) BUSINESSES. THE COMPLAINT CONTENDS

THAT EACH OF THE DEFENDANTS HAS MARKET POWER IN THE ALLEGED TWO

MARKETS. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS A JUDGMENT PERMANENTLY ENJOINING

THE DEFENDANTS FROM ENFORCING THEIR ANTI-STEERING AND

NON-DISCRIMINATION RULES AND CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS. THE

COMPLAINT DOES NOT SEEK MONETARY DAMAGES. CONCURRENT WITH THE

FILING OF THE COMPLAINT, VISA AND MASTERCARD ANNOUNCED THEY HAD

REACHED AN AGREEMENT SETTLING THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPLAINT

AGAINST THEM BY AGREEING TO MODIFICATIONS IN THEIR RULES

PROHIBITING MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT THEIR CARDS FROM STEERING

CUSTOMERS TO USE ANOTHER NETWORKS CARD, ANOTHER TYPE OF

CARD OR ANOTHER METHOD OF PAYMENT. AMERICAN EXPRESS RESPONSE TO

THE COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON DECEMBER 7, 2010. ON

DECEMBER 20, 2010, THE COMPLAINT FILED BY THE DOJ AND

CERTAIN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL WAS AMENDED TO ADD AS PLAINTIFFS

THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM ARIZONA, HAWAII, IDAHO, ILLINOIS,

MONTANA, NEBRASKA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, RHODE ISLAND, TENNESSEE, UTAH

AND VERMONT. AMERICAN EXPRESS RESPONSE TO THE AMENDED

COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON JANUARY 4, 2011. A HEARING HAS BEEN

SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 2, 2011 TO DISCUSS SCHEDULING AND

COORDINATION OF THE DOJ AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL LITIGATION

WITH OTHER CASES PENDING IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

AGAINST AMERICAN EXPRESS RELATING TO THE NON-DISCRIMINATION

PROVISIONS IN ITS MERCHANT AGREEMENTS, WHICH CASES ARE DESCRIBED

BELOW IN THE SECTION ENTITLED U.S. CARD SERVICES AND

GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES MATTERS.

ON FEBRUARY 20, 2009, A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED

BROZOVICH V. AMERICAN EXPRESS CO., KENNETH I. CHENAULT

AND DANIEL T. HENRY

, WAS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGED

VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH

CERTAIN ALLEGED MISSTATEMENTS REGARDING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF

THE COMPANYS CREDIT CARD CUSTOMERS. THE PURPORTED CLASS

COVERED THE PERIOD FROM MARCH 1, 2007 TO NOVEMBER 12,

2008. THE ACTION SOUGHT UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND COSTS AND FEES.

THE

BROZOVICH

ACTION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY VOLUNTARILY

DISMISSED. IN MARCH 2009, A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION, CAPTIONED

BAYDALE V. AMERICAN EXPRESS CO., KENNETH I. CHENAULT AND

DANIEL HENRY

, WHICH MADE SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS TO THOSE MADE

IN THE

BROZOVICH

ACTION, WAS FILED IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. IN OCTOBER

2009, THE PLAINTIFF IN THE

BAYDALE

ACTION FILED AN

AMENDED CONSOLIDATED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT IN THE ACTION.

THE COMPANY FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS WITH THE COURT. ON

JULY 19, 2010, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS

92

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MOTION TO DISMISS AND DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT IN ITS ENTIRETY.

THE PLAINTIFF HAS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL WITH THE UNITED

STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

IN MAY 2008, A SHAREHOLDERS DERIVATIVE SUIT WAS FILED IN

NEW YORK STATE SUPREME COURT IN MANHATTAN NAMING AMERICAN

EXPRESS COMPANY AND CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND

SENIOR EXECUTIVES AS DEFENDANTS. THE CASE, CAPTIONED AS

CITY

OF TALLAHASSEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM V. AKERSON ET AL.,

ALLEGES BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTY ARISING FROM KNOWING

BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS BY CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER

OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY THAT HAVE LED TO THE

IMPOSITION OF DEFERRED CRIMINAL CHARGES ON A BANK THAT AT THE

TIME SUCH CHARGES WERE ENTERED WAS OWNED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS, AS

WELL AS THE COMPANYS PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY

$65 MILLION IN PENALTIES TO FEDERAL AND STATE

REGULATORS RELATED TO AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LIMITEDS

(AEBL) AND TRSS ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS. THE

COMPLAINT ALSO STATES THAT THE SALE OF AEBL TOOK PLACE AFTER

AMERICAN EXPRESS HAD ALLOWED THE VALUE OF ITS BANKING

BUSINESS UNIT TO BE DRAMATICALLY IMPAIRED ON ACCOUNT OF THE

SYSTEMIC VIOLATIONS OF LAW AND RESULTING DEFERRED CRIMINAL

CHARGES. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS MONETARY DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF

THE COMPANY. THE DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE

COMPLAINT AND IN OCTOBER 2009, THE COURT DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT

AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS. THE PLAINTIFF HAD FILED A NOTICE OF

APPEAL OF THE DISMISSAL, BUT HAS SINCE INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT

IT DOES NOT INTEND TO PURSUE SUCH APPEAL.

IN DECEMBER 2008, A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED

OBESTER V. AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, ET AL.

WAS

FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANTS

VIOLATED CERTAIN ERISA OBLIGATIONS BY: ALLOWING THE INVESTMENT

OF AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN (PLAN)

ASSETS IN AMERICAN EXPRESS COMMON STOCK WHEN AMERICAN EXPRESS

COMMON STOCK WAS NOT A PRUDENT INVESTMENT; MISREPRESENTING AND

FAILING TO DISCLOSE MATERIAL FACTS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN; AND BREACHING

CERTAIN FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS. THEREAFTER, THREE OTHER PUTATIVE

CLASS ACTIONS MAKING ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE MADE IN THE

OBESTER

MATTER WERE FILED AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS.

TANG V. AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, ET AL.

, FILED ON

DECEMBER 29, 2008 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

, FILED ON FEBRUARY 10, 2009 IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. AMERICAN

EXPRESS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THESE ACTIONS. IN APRIL 2009,

THESE ACTIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED

COMPLAINT, CAPTIONED

IN RE AMERICAN EXPRESS ERISA

LITIGATION.

FOLLOWING ARGUMENT ON AMERICAN EXPRESS

MOTION TO DISMISS THIS ACTION, THE COURT PERMITTED PLAINTIFFS TO

FILE A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT. IN APRIL 2010, AMERICAN EXPRESS

FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT. ON

NOVEMBER 2, 2010, THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED THE SECOND

AMENDED COMPLAINT IN ITS ENTIRETY. ON DECEMBER 2, 2010,

PLAINTIFFS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL, APPEALING THE CASE TO THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. THAT

APPEAL IS CURRENTLY PENDING.

THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED

KAUFMAN V. AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES

,

WHICH WAS FILED ON FEBRUARY 14, 2007, AND IS PENDING IN THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

ILLINOIS. THE ALLEGATIONS IN KAUFMAN RELATE PRIMARILY TO MONTHLY

SERVICE FEE CHARGES IN RESPECT OF THE COMPANYS GIFT CARD

PRODUCTS, WITH THE PRINCIPAL CLAIM BEING THAT THE COMPANYS

GIFT CARDS VIOLATE CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTES BECAUSE

CONSUMERS ALLEGEDLY HAVE DIFFICULTY SPENDING SMALL RESIDUAL

AMOUNTS ON THE GIFT CARDS PRIOR TO THE IMPOSITION OF MONTHLY

SERVICE FEES. IN JANUARY 2009, THE COMPANY SIGNED A MEMORANDUM

OF UNDERSTANDING TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS. SINCE SUCH TIME, THE

PARTIES HAVE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WAS

SUBMITTED TO THE COURT FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL. THE PROPOSED

OTHER

INFORMATION

ON FEBRUARY 24, 2011, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY

APPROVED AN AMENDMENT TO SECTION 2.2 OF THE COMPANYS

AMENDED TO ALLOW SHAREHOLDERS HOLDING AT LEAST 25% OF THE

OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY, DETERMINED TO BE

NET LONG SHARES (AS DESCRIBED IN THE AMENDMENT), TO

REQUEST THAT THE COMPANY HOLD A SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS.

SHAREHOLDERS REQUESTING THE SPECIAL MEETING ARE REQUIRED TO

DISCLOSE CERTAIN INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION REQUIRED BY

THE COMPANYS ADVANCE NOTICE BY-LAWS, WITH RESPECT TO ANY

PROPOSED BUSINESS OR DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS AT THE SPECIAL

HELD BY THE REQUESTING SHAREHOLDERS ACTS AS A REVOCATION OF THE

MEETING REQUEST TO THE EXTENT OF THE REDUCTION AND AGREE TO

HELD BY THE REQUESTING SHAREHOLDERS. THE REQUESTING SHAREHOLDERS

ARE REQUIRED TO UPDATE THE DISCLOSURE REQUIRED BY THE AMENDMENT

AS OF THE RECORD DATE FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING (AND, IN THE CASE

OF DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR SHARE OWNERSHIP, AS OF A DATE NO LATER

THAN FIVE BUSINESS DAYS BEFORE THE SCHEDULED DATE OF THE SPECIAL

MEETING).

THE AMENDMENT ENUMERATES CERTAIN INSTANCES IN WHICH A SPECIAL

MEETING NEED NOT BE CALLED, INCLUDING BECAUSE THE REQUEST FOR

THE SPECIAL MEETING: IS CONTRARY TO THE BY-LAWS; IS NOT AN

APPROPRIATE SUBJECT FOR SHAREHOLDER ACTION; IS MADE LESS THAN

90 DAYS PRIOR TO THE ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE PRECEDING

ANNUAL MEETING; RELATES TO A SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR ITEM (OTHER

ITEM, INCLUDING ELECTION OR REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS, THAT WILL BE

VOTED ON AT AN ANNUAL OR SPECIAL MEETING TO BE HELD WITHIN

120 DAYS; OR WAS MADE IN VIOLATION OF THE PROXY RULES.

BE COMPLETE AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE

AMENDED BY-LAWS WHICH ARE ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT 3.5

AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.
