INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE COMPANY, WE, US OR OUR), IS A LEADING GLOBAL PAYMENTS, NETWORK

AND TRAVEL COMPANY THAT OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1850 AS A JOINT STOCK ASSOCIATION. WE WERE INCORPORATED IN 1965 AS A NEW YORK CORPORATION.

OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK IN LOWER MANHATTAN. WE ALSO HAVE OFFICES IN OTHER LOCATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT

THE WORLD.

EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2005, WE REALIGNED OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS TO REFLECT THE SPIN-OFF TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OF OUR

AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS BUSINESS UNIT (NOW KNOWN AS AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. (AMERIPRISE)). WE NOW HAVE FOUR OPERATING SEGMENTS: GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES, U.S. CARD SERVICES, INTERNATIONAL CARD &

GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES AND CORPORATE & OTHER, EACH OF WHOSE BUSINESSES WE WILL DESCRIBE BELOW.

2005 HIGHLIGHTS

2005 WAS A YEAR OF GROWTH AND CHANGE FOR OUR COMPANY. WE ACHIEVED RECORD EARNINGS DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH IN SPENDING ON OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE WERE ABLE TO INVEST IN OUR FUTURE

GROWTH BY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASING OUR SPENDING ON BUSINESS-BUILDING ACTIVITIES, WHICH RESULTED IN GROWTH IN CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND CARDS-IN-FORCE.

COMPARED WITH 2004, WE DELIVERED.



REVENUES OF $24.3 BILLION, UP 10.5% FROM $22.0 BILLION;



INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $3.2 BILLION, UP 19.9% FROM $2.7 BILLION;



NET INCOME OF $3.7 BILLION, UP 8.4% FROM $3.4 BILLION;



DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BASED ON INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $2.56, UP 22.5% FROM $2.09;



DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.97, UP 10.8% FROM $2.68; AND



RETURN ON EQUITY OF 25.4%, COMPARED WITH 22.0%.

DURING

THE YEAR, WE ALSO BEGAN A NEW CHAPTER IN OUR COMPANYS HISTORY. ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2005, WE COMPLETED THE TAX-FREE SPIN-OFF OF THE COMMON STOCK OF AMERIPRISE THROUGH A PRO-RATA DIVIDEND TO OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. AMERIPRISE IS IN THE

BUSINESS OF PROVIDING FINANCIAL PLANNING, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INSURANCE SERVICES. AMERIPRISES RESULTS ARE REPORTED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THROUGH THE SPIN-OFF DATE. WE BELIEVE THE AMERIPRISE

SPIN-OFF GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON OUR HIGHER GROWTH, HIGHER-RETURNING PAYMENTS AND NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS AND PLACES US IN A BETTER POSITION TO CAPITALIZE ON POTENTIAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THIS TRANSACTION IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL

BELOW AND ON PAGES 24, 33, 66 AND 73-74 OF OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH DESCRIPTION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

THIS REPORT DESCRIBES AMERICAN EXPRESS AS PRESENTLY STRUCTURED AND OPERATED.

FOR A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF OUR 2005 FINANCIAL

RESULTS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING EACH OF OUR FOUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, SEE PAGES 24-101 OF THE COMPANYS 2005 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. FOR A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY AND OUR

OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND A DISCUSSION OF OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF REVENUE, SEE PAGES 24-26 AND PAGES 66-68 OF THE 2005 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WE HAVE GRANTED LICENSES TO PARTIALLY-OWNED AFFILIATES AND UNAFFILIATED ENTITIES TO OFFER SOME OF

THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

OUR GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK AND CARD ISSUING BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL IN SCOPE. WE ARE A WORLD LEADER IN

PROVIDING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. THESE CARDS, WHICH INCLUDE CARDS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS AS WELL AS CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED ON THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS NETWORK (COLLECTIVELY, CARDS), ARE CURRENTLY ISSUED IN OVER 45 CURRENCIES. IN 2005, OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS (SPENDING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CARDS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS $484.4 BILLION. OUR CARDS PERMIT CARDMEMBERS TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF

GOODS AND SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT THE MILLIONS OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO. WE ADDED A NET TOTAL OF 5.6 MILLION CARDS IN 2005, BRINGING TOTAL WORLDWIDE CARDS-IN-FORCE TO 71.0 MILLION (INCLUDING

CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES).

SPEND-CENTRIC MODEL IS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS MODEL (IN WHICH WE FOCUS PRIMARILY ON GENERATING REVENUES BY DRIVING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND

SECONDARILY BY FINANCE CHARGES AND FEES) HAS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. CARD ISSUERS GENERATE THE MAJORITY OF THEIR INCOME THROUGH SOME COMBINATION OF CUSTOMER SPENDING (WHICH GENERATES PAYMENTS FROM MERCHANTS FOR CARD TRANSACTIONS),

LENDING (WHICH GENERATES FINANCE CHARGES ON REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES) AND CUSTOMER FEES. WE HAVE STRENGTH IN ALL THREE REVENUE STREAMS, AND WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE EDGE IN SPENDING. ON AVERAGE, U.S. CARDMEMBERS SPEND CLOSE TO FOUR TIMES AS MUCH ON

THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AS THEY DO ON MASTERCARD AND VISA CARDS. FOR MERCHANTS, OUR CARDMEMBERS HIGHER SPENDING REPRESENTS GREATER VALUE TO THEM IN THE FORM OF HIGHER SALES AND LOYAL CUSTOMERS, WHICH GIVES US THE ABILITY TO EARN A PREMIUM

DISCOUNT RATE. AS A RESULT, WE CAN GENERATE HIGHER REVENUES FROM SPENDING AND HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO KEEP CUSTOMERS SPENDING MORE ON THEIR CARDS AND OFFER MARKETING PROGRAMS TO MERCHANTS TO

ENABLE THEM TO ATTRACT HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBER CUSTOMERS. THIS, IN TURN, DRIVES MORE BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS. THIS BUSINESS MODEL, ALONG WITH OUR CLOSED LOOP NETWORK, IN WHICH WE ARE BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT

ACQUIRER, GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WE SEEK TO LEVERAGE TO PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS, MERCHANTS AND CARD-ISSUING PARTNERS.

OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, ALTHOUGH TRAVEL SALES TEND

TO BE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER; TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES OUTSTANDING TEND TO BE GREATEST EACH YEAR IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD QUARTER, AND CARD BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

WE OPERATE A GLOBAL GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK THROUGH OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES (GNS) BUSINESS. NETWORK FUNCTIONS

INCLUDE OPERATIONS, SERVICE DELIVERY, SYSTEMS, AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING, SETTLEMENT AND BRAND ADVERTISING AND MARKETING; THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS FOR THE NETWORK; AND ESTABLISHING AND ENHANCING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS

GLOBALLY.

SINCE MAY 1996, WE HAVE BEEN PURSUING A STRATEGY OF INVITING U.S. BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE CARDS ON THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS NETWORK, BUILDING ON A BUSINESS STRATEGY WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHERE WE HAVE MANY BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ISSUING CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. BY

LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WE AIM TO BROADEN OUR CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. OUR GNS BUSINESS HAS ESTABLISHED 97 CARD-ISSUING OR MERCHANT ACQUIRING ARRANGEMENTS WITH

BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES.

A KEY ASSET OF OUR NETWORK IS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WHICH IS ONE OF THE

WORLDS MOST HIGHLY RECOGNIZED AND RESPECTED BRANDS. CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE ISSUED BY OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY (AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. (TRS)) AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND ALSO BY

THIRD-PARTY INSTITUTIONS, AND ARE ACCEPTED AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS BRANDED CARDS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO MAY ALSO BE ACCEPTED AT ALL ATM LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT

CARDS. TRS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE THE VAST MAJORITY OF CARDS ON OUR NETWORK.

GNS FOCUSES ON PARTNERING WITH QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHO CHOOSE TO ISSUE CARDS ACCEPTED ON OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. ALTHOUGH WE CUSTOMIZE OUR NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS TO THE PARTICULAR MARKET AND OUR PARTNERS REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANS IN THAT MARKETPLACE, ALL

GNS ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ISSUERS DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR THEIR HIGHEST-SPENDING AND MOST AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND TO SUPPORT THE VALUE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MERCHANTS. WE CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH INSTITUTIONS WHO SHARE A CORE

SET OF ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS, STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE AND COMPATIBILITY WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, AND WE REQUIRE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRODUCT, BRAND AND SERVICE STANDARDS

THE USE OF THE TERM PARTNER OR PARTNERING DOES NOT MEAN OR IMPLY A FORMAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS FALL INTO THREE MAIN CATEGORIES. THE FIRST AND MOST COMMON TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT

IS KNOWN AS A NETWORK CARD LICENSE (NCL) (WHICH WE FORMERLY REFERRED TO AS A NON-PROPRIETARY LICENSE). AT THE END OF 2005, WE HAD 50 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, WE GRANT THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION A

LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRANDED CARDS. WE GENERALLY PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN MARKETS WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE A STRONG, WELL ESTABLISHED LOCAL BUSINESS. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, AMERICAN EXPRESS MAINTAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ACQUIRE AND

SERVICE THE MERCHANTS IN THE LOCAL MARKET THAT ACCEPT CARDS. THE NCL ISSUER OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS FOR ALL CARDS IT ISSUES, PROVIDES CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ITS CARDMEMBERS, TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, BILLING AND CREDIT MANAGEMENT, IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MARKETING OF THE CARDS, AND DESIGNS THE CARD PRODUCT FEATURES (INCLUDING REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR CARD HOLDERS), SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS. WE OPERATE THE MERCHANT NETWORK AND ROUTE AND PROCESS CARD

TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANTS POINT OF SALE THROUGH SUBMISSION TO THE ISSUER, AND SETTLE WITH ISSUERS. THE NCL IS THE MODEL THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED WITH BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES. EXAMPLES OF NCL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH

MBNA AMERICA BANK, N.A. (MBNA), CITIBANK, BANK OF AMERICA, LLOYDS TSB BANK (IN THE UNITED KINGDOM) AND INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA.

GNS REVENUES IN NCL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DERIVED FROM THE LEVEL OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING, ROYALTIES AND FEES CHARGED TO THE CARD ISSUER BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, AND OUR PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SUCH AS

CARDMEMBER INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER CARD FEATURES AND BENEFITS FOR THE ISSUERS CARDS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THE NCL ISSUER BEARS THE CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL AS THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION COSTS, CARDMEMBER FRAUD

RISKS AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND OTHER LOYALTY INITIATIVES. WE BEAR THE RISK ARISING FROM THE GNS PARTNERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH ISSUERS WHOM WE BELIEVE ARE

FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, WE GENERALLY

REQUIRE NCL ISSUERS TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

THE SECOND TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT

IS KNOWN AS AN INDEPENDENT OPERATOR (IO) ARRANGEMENT. AS OF THE END OF 2005, WE HAD OVER 40 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. UNDER THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT, WE LICENSE OUR BANK PARTNER TO ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS IN THE

PARTICULAR MARKET(S) IN WHICH IT IS LOCATED, WHERE, IN THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THEY ALSO SERVE AS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR. OUR LOCAL IO PARTNER OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS,

AND MAKES THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL BE ISSUED CARDS. SIMILAR TO THE NCL-TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT, GNS GENERATES REVENUES IN IO ARRANGEMENTS FROM FEES PAID BY THE IO PARTNER DERIVED FROM THE NUMBER OF CARDS IT ISSUES, THE LEVEL OF

CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON THOSE, CARDS, ROYALTIES AND TOTAL CHARGE VOLUME ON ALL CARDS AT MERCHANTS WITH WHOM THE IO PARTNER HAS AN AGREEMENT TO ACCEPT CARDS. OUR IO PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATIONS, BILLING, PRICING, CARDMEMBER

SERVICING AND FUNDING CARD RECEIVABLES.

WE TYPICALLY ESTABLISH IO ARRANGEMENTS IN MARKETS WHERE WE HAVE NOT BUILT A SIGNIFICANT LOCAL

CURRENCY CARD BUSINESS OF OUR OWN. THE IO PARTNERS LOCAL PRESENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS HELP THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK REACH MERCHANT COVERAGE GOALS MORE QUICKLY, AND OPERATE AT

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ECONOMIC SCALES AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE

ENTERED INTO IO ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE DENMARK, ECUADOR, GREECE, SOUTH KOREA, PAKISTAN, CROATIA, PERU AND VIETNAM.

THE THIRD TYPE OF GNS

ARRANGEMENT IS A JOINT VENTURE.

WE HAVE UTILIZED THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT IN SWITZERLAND, BELGIUM AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES. IN THESE MARKETS, TRS JOINS WITH A THIRD PARTY TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN WHICH TRS HAS A SIGNIFICANT

OWNERSHIP STAKE. THE JOINT VENTURE TYPICALLY SIGNS NEW MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND ISSUES LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS LOCALLY THAT CARRY OUR LOGO. IN A JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENT, THE JOINT VENTURE ASSUMES THE CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK, AND

BEARS THE OPERATING AND MARKETING COSTS. THE ECONOMICS OF THE JOINT VENTURE ARE SIMILAR TO OUR PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS, WHICH WE DISCUSS BELOW UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES, AND WE RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE JOINT VENTURES

INCOME DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST.

GROSS REVENUES WE RECEIVE PER DOLLAR SPENT ON A CARD ISSUED BY A GNS PARTNER ARE

LOWER THAN THOSE FROM OUR PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GNS PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE OPERATING COSTS AND RISK OF ITS CARD ISSUING BUSINESS, OUR EXPENSES ARE LOWER THAN THOSE IN OUR PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING

BUSINESS. THE GNS BUSINESS MODEL GENERATES AN ATTRACTIVE EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE THAT REQUIRES A LOWER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SUPPORT. THE RETURN ON EQUITY IN OUR GNS BUSINESS CAN THUS BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD

ISSUING BUSINESS. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF GNS COSTS ARE FIXED, THE GNS BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SCALABLE. GNS PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND AND

DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS WITH INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.

IN 2005, WE ENTERED INTO NEW GNS RELATIONSHIPS WITH 14 FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. GNS PARTNERS LAUNCHED OVER 50 NEW PRODUCTS DURING 2005, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS PARTNER PRODUCTS TO APPROXIMATELY 450. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE SIGNED A NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS OVER THE PAST

YEAR IN MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA, RUSSIA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, SOUTH KOREA AND HUNGARY. THE GNS BUSINESS NOW HAS OVER 90 PARTNERS REPRESENTING OVER 100 GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS.

SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR GNS BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN 2005 INCLUDE.



IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE RUSSIAN STANDARD BANK FOR IT TO ISSUE AND MARKET RUSSIAN RUBLE- OR U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AMERICAN EXPRESS



AN AGREEMENT WITH NUEVO BANCO COMMERCIAL IN URUGUAY FOR IT TO ISSUE CARDS FOR USE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, AS WELL AS ACQUIRE NEW MERCHANTS FOR OUR CARD NETWORK IN THAT

COUNTRY.

IN CONTRAST TO THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHERE BANKS AND OTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS HAVE ISSUED

CARDS ON OUR NETWORK FOR MANY YEARS, UNTIL 2004 NO MAJOR U.S. BANKS HAD ISSUED CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL MERCHANT NETWORK. THIS SITUATION WAS THE RESULT OF RULES AND POLICIES OF VISA U.S.A. AND VISA INTERNATIONAL

SERVICE ASSOCIATION (TOGETHER, VISA) AND MASTERCARD, INCORPORATED AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC. (TOGETHER, MASTERCARD) IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH MANDATED EXPULSION OF MEMBERS WHO ISSUED AMERICAN EXPRESS BRANDED CARDS.

NO BANK WAS WILLING TO RISK FORFEITING MEMBERSHIP IN VISA AND/OR MASTERCARD TO ISSUE CARDS ON OUR NETWORK.

HOWEVER, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF

THE DECISION IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN OCTOBER 1998 BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD IN WHICH SUCH RULES AND POLICIES WERE FOUND TO VIOLATE THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS, THESE RULES AND POLICIES WERE FINALLY REPEALED IN LATE 2004

AFTER THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO HEAR VISAS AND MASTERCARDS APPEAL OF THE LOWER COURTS RULINGS AGAINST THEM. THE SUPREME COURTS DECISION NOT TO HEAR THE APPEALS MARKED THE END OF VISAS AND MASTERCARDS

RULES THAT PREVENTED THEIR MEMBER BANKS FROM ISSUING CARDS ON COMPETITIVE NETWORKS AND CLEARED THE WAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRIAL COURTS ORDER REQUIRING THE REPEAL OF THE ILLEGAL RULES. WE VIEW THIS DECISION AS A MAJOR VICTORY FOR U.S.

CONSUMERS AS WELL AS U.S. BANKS BECAUSE IT OPENED THE DOOR TO MORE VIGOROUS NETWORK COMPETITION AND MORE INNOVATIVE CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE CONCLUSION OF THE LITIGATION BROUGHT BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MEANT THAT WE WERE NOW ABLE TO OPEN OUR NETWORK TO OTHER CARD ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES, JUST

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS WE HAVE DONE INTERNATIONALLY. BUILDING A NETWORK BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT OPERATES IN ADDITION TO OUR

PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS PROVIDES US WITH NEW AND SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH. WE HAVE ACTED ON THIS DECISION BY ENTERING INTO SEVERAL GNS ARRANGEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES.



IN JANUARY 2004, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH MBNA AMERICA BANK, N.A., WHICH BEGAN TO ISSUE CARDS ACCEPTED ON OUR NETWORK IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 AFTER THE SUPREME

COURTS ACTION.



IN DECEMBER 2004, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH CITIBANK, N.A., WHICH LED TO THE LAUNCH OF CARDS IN DECEMBER 2005.



IN APRIL 2005, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH JUNIPER BANK, A MEMBER OF THE BARCLAYS GROUP, PURSUANT TO WHICH IT WILL ISSUE CARDS ON OUR NETWORK TO BE OFFERED TO U.S. WEALTH

MANAGEMENT CLIENTS OF UBS.



IN MAY 2005, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH USAA FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK UNDER WHICH IT WILL ISSUE CREDIT CARDS THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED ON OUR NETWORK BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2006.



IN DECEMBER 2005, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH BANK OF AMERICA UNDER WHICH IT WILL ISSUE AND MARKET CARDS THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED ON OUR NETWORK BEGINNING IN 2006.



ALSO IN DECEMBER 2005, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH HSBC BANK NEVADA, N.A. UNDER WHICH IT WILL ISSUE CREDIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED ON OUR NETWORK.



IN JANUARY 2006, WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT WITH GE CONSUMER FINANCE UNDER WHICH GE MONEY BANK WILL ISSUE CARDS THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED ON OUR NETWORK, WITH THE FIRST PRODUCT TO BE

OFFERED UNDER THE AGREEMENT BEING THE DILLARDS AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD, A CO-BRANDED CARD TO BE ISSUED BY GE MONEY BANK IN CONJUNCTION WITH DILLARDS, THE FASHION APPAREL AND HOME FURNISHINGS RETAILER.

IN ADDITION, IN NOVEMBER 2004, WE FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST VISA, MASTERCARD AND CERTAIN OF THEIR MEMBER BANKS SEEKING MONETARY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE

ILLEGAL RULES THAT WERE STRUCK DOWN IN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LAWSUIT DISCUSSED ABOVE. (YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT THIS LAWSUIT IN THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS SECTION OF THIS REPORT BELOW.)

WITH APPROXIMATELY 450 DIFFERENT CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED ON OUR NETWORK SO FAR BY OUR BANK PARTNERS, GNS IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT IS

STRENGTHENING OUR MARKET PRESENCE, DRIVING MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO OUR MERCHANT NETWORK AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. IN TOTAL, THE GNS BUSINESS HAS ADDED OVER 10.8 MILLION NEW CARDS TO OUR

NETWORK (NET OF ATTRITION). SINCE 1999, CARDS-IN-FORCE ISSUED BY THE GNS BUSINESS HAVE GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 25%. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 45% OF NEW CARDS ISSUED IN 2005 WERE CARDS ISSUED BY ONE OF OUR GNS

PARTNERS, AND GNS PARTNERS BROUGHT NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF ALL NEW MERCHANTS INTO OUR NETWORK DURING THE YEAR. SPENDING ON THESE CARDS HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE OF 21% SINCE 1999 AND TOTALED $24 BILLION IN 2005.

LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR

IMPACTING OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH SUCH ARRANGEMENTS EXIST, BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY LICENSED TO ISSUE GENERAL PURPOSE CARDS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR GNS

PARTNERS HAVE GENERALLY NOT HAD DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO GNS ARRANGEMENTS. AS A NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDER TO REGULATED U.S. BANKS, OUR GNS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO

REVIEW BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION.

COMPETITION

OUR NETWORK COMPETES WITH OTHER CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB (WHICH, IN THE UNITED STATES, HAS BEEN FOLDED INTO THE NETWORK OPERATED BY MASTERCARD), DISCOVER, A BUSINESS UNIT OF MORGAN STANLEY (PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES), AND JCB CO., LTD. (PRIMARILY IN ASIA). THE

PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK BUSINESS INCLUDE.



THE NUMBER OF CARDS-IN-FORCE AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THESE CARDS;



THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THE CARDS CAN BE USED;



THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS OF PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK;



THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS;



REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION;



INNOVATION IN SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS;



THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE; AND



THE SECURITY OF CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT INFORMATION.

GLOBAL MERCHANT

SERVICES

WE OPERATE A GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS (MERCHANT ACQUISITION) AND

ACCEPTING AND PROCESSING CARD TRANSACTIONS AND PAYING MERCHANTS (TRANSACTION PROCESSING) THAT ACCEPT CARDS FOR PURCHASES MADE BY CARDMEMBERS WITH CARDS (CHARGES). WE ALSO PROVIDE POINT-OF-SALE AND BACK-OFFICE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND

MARKETING PROGRAMS TO MERCHANTS.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE MERCHANT COVERAGE SO THAT CARDMEMBERS ARE ABLE TO USE THE CARD WHEREVER AND

HOWEVER THEY DESIRE, AS WELL AS TO INCREASE COVERAGE IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND IN NEW INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT, TO DATE, ACCEPTED GENERAL PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT. WE ADD NEW MERCHANTS TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER

OF SALES CHANNELS: A PROPRIETARY SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY SALES AGENTS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH BANKS, THE INTERNET, TELEMARKETING AND INBOUND WANT TO HONOR CALLS (I.E., MERCHANTS DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD CONTACTING US DIRECTLY).

SINCE THE EARLY 1990S, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF

BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD. IN RECENT YEARS,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE USE OF OUR CARDS FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 64% OF OUR U.S. BILLINGS

CAME FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 36% CAME FROM RETAIL AND OTHER SECTORS. THAT PROPORTION HAS NOW BEEN MORE THAN REVERSED. IN 2005, U.S. NON-TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT BILLINGS REPRESENTED 68% OF THE U.S. BILLED BUSINESS ON AMERICAN

EXPRESS CARDS. THIS SHIFT RESULTED FROM THE GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS WHO BEGAN TO ACCEPT CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS INCREASED DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR MORE OF THEIR PURCHASES, AND OUR FOCUS ON

EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MEET CARDMEMBERS NEEDS.

DURING 2005, WE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO USE THE CARD

FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. WE INCREASED THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF MERCHANTS IN RETAIL AND EVERYDAY SPENDING CATEGORIES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD, SUCH AS QUICK-SERVE RESTAURANTS, RETAIL STORES, SUPERMARKETS AND GAS STATIONS.

DURING 2005 WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR DRIVE OF BRINGING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO INDUSTRIES WHERE CASH OR CHECKS ARE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF PAYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE,

IN THE AREA OF APARTMENT RENTALS TRS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH KSI MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, A MANAGER OF RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTIES IN THE D.C. METROPOLITAN AREA, TO ALLOW RESIDENTS TO CHARGE THEIR MONTHLY RENT PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO THEIR AMERICAN

EXPRESS CARDS. IN ADDITION, UNITED HEALTHCARE HAS AGREED TO ACCEPT THE CARD FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL INSURANCE PREMIUMS. CARD ACCEPTANCE AT HOTELS AND CONFERENCE CENTERS FOR BUSINESS MEETINGS AND EVENTS AND BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS PURCHASES ARE OTHER

EXAMPLES OF NEW INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE CARD IS NOW ACCEPTED, AND WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE CARDMEMBER SPENDING.

AS

IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2005, WE CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE OF CARDS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO REFINE OUR APPROACH TO CALCULATING MERCHANT COVERAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE. GLOBALLY, ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE

AND CREDIT CARDS CONTINUES TO INCREASE, INCLUDING MERCHANTS IN INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT, AS OF THE END OF 2005, OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE

THAN 90% OF CARDMEMBERS GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT NETWORK ACCOMMODATED OVER 80% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING.

WE EARN DISCOUNT REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AS PAYMENT FOR GOODS OR SERVICES SOLD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS

THE FEE CHARGED TO THE MERCHANT FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AND IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE AMOUNT CHARGED ON A CARD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT THAT THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER (IN

MOST CASES, TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) PAYS TO A MERCHANT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE MERCHANT, ACCEPTS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANT, PAYS THE MERCHANT FOR THESE

TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS THROUGH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK TO THE APPROPRIATE CARD ISSUER FOR BILLING TO THE CARDMEMBER. WHEN A CARDMEMBER PRESENTS THE CARD FOR PAYMENT, THE MERCHANT CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR THE TRANSACTION

AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE TIME THE TRANSACTION IS CAPTURED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHERE WE ACT AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE CARD PRESENTED AT A MERCHANT IS ISSUED BY A THIRD-PARTY

BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF SOME OF OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS, WE WILL MAKE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT TO THE MERCHANT AND RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT REVENUE. IN OUR ROLE AS THE OPERATOR OF THE CARD NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO RECEIVE FINANCIAL

SETTLEMENT FROM THE CARD ISSUER, WHO RETAINS AN ISSUER RATE (I.E., THE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AMOUNT THAT CARD ISSUERS RECEIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS CHARGED ON OUR NETWORK WITH CARDS THAT THEY ISSUE, WHICH IS USUALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE

CHARGED AMOUNT). THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT REVENUE (RECEIVED BY US IN THE FORM OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT) AND THE ISSUER RATE RECEIVED BY THE CARD ISSUER GENERATES A RETURN TO US. WHERE WE ARE THE CARD ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A

THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WE RECEIVE AN ISSUER RATE IN OUR SETTLEMENT WITH THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WHICH IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE.

THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMS DEPICT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE PARTIES IN A POINT-OF-SALE TRANSACTION EFFECTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK WHERE WE ACT AS BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND MERCHANT ACQUIRER (THE 3-PARTY

MODEL) AND UNDER AN NCL ARRANGEMENT WHERE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ACT AS THE CARD ISSUER (THE NCL MODEL).

THE LEVEL OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE THAT WE CHARGE IS PRINCIPALLY DETERMINED BY THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO THE

MERCHANT AND GENERALLY REPRESENTS A PREMIUM OVER OTHER CARDS. WE DELIVER VALUE TO THE MERCHANT THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS RELATIVE TO CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETING CARD NETWORKS, THE OVERALL HIGHER VOLUME OF SPENDING BY ALL CARDMEMBERS,

MARKETING PROGRAMS AND CARDMEMBERS INSISTENCE ON USING THEIR CARDS WHEN ENROLLED IN REWARDS OR OTHER CARD LOYALTY PROGRAMS.

THE

MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE VARIES WITH THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE MERCHANT DOES BUSINESS, THE CHARGE VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT TO THE MERCHANT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF THE CARD

ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH US (LOCAL OR GLOBAL), AND THE AVERAGE CHARGE AMOUNT. IN 2005, AS IN PRIOR YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SOME REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF SELECTIVE

REPRICING INITIATIVES, CONTINUED CHANGES IN THE MIX OF BUSINESS RESULTING FROM THE GROWTH IN LOWER RATE EVERYDAY SPEND MERCHANT CATEGORIES AND VOLUME-RELATED PRICING DISCOUNTS. WE EXPECT THAT THE EFFECT OF THESE FACTORS WILL LIKELY

CONTINUE TO RESULT IN SOME EROSION OVER TIME OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE MOST MERCHANTS UNDERSTAND OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE PRICING IN RELATION TO THE VALUE PROVIDED, WE

DO ENCOUNTER A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, BUT TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER TO ACCEPT ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT AND, CONSEQUENTLY, SUPPRESS USE OF THE CARD. WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO THIS

ISSUE. WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS BY: CONCENTRATING ON ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD; CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE PROVIDE BY PROGRAMS SUCH AS AMERICAN EXPRESS SELECTS

SM

, WHICH ENABLES MERCHANTS TO GAIN VALUABLE EXPOSURE AND ADDITIONAL SALES BY MAKING ONLINE OFFERS, SUCH AS DISCOUNTS ON PURCHASES AVAILABLE TO CARDMEMBERS

ON A WEB SITE MAINTAINED BY US; PROVIDING BETTER AND EARLIER COMMUNICATION OF OUR VALUE PROPOSITION; AND, WHEN NECESSARY, BY CANCELING MERCHANTS WHO SUPPRESS THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

MERCHANT SATISFACTION IS A KEY GOAL OF OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES BUSINESS. WE FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MERCHANT

SATISFACTION, EXECUTING PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS AND STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS THROUGH AN EXPANDING ROSTER OF SERVICES THAT HELP THEM MEET THEIR BUSINESS GOALS. WE OFFER A FULL RANGE OF POINT-OF-SALE

SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATED POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS AND DIRECT LINKS THAT ALLOW OUR MERCHANT PARTNERS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AS WELL AS BANKCARDS, DEBIT CARDS AND CHECKS. VIRTUALLY ALL PROPRIETARY POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS SUPPORT

DIRECT PROCESSING (I.E., DIRECT CONNECTIVITY) TO AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH LOWERS A MERCHANTS COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE AND AVOIDS ANY PAYMENT DELAYS CAUSED BY A THIRD PARTY. DURING 2004, WE LAUNCHED BUSINESS SAVINGS FOR ALL U.S. MERCHANTS THAT

ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, WHICH PROVIDES THEM WITH WAYS TO REDUCE EXPENSES FOR SHIPPING, COMPUTERS AND MARKETING SERVICES THROUGH PRE-NEGOTIATED DISCOUNTS AT SELECT PARTNERS. THIS PAST YEAR WE INTRODUCED COSTCO TO THE PROGRAM WITH A MEMBERSHIP

OFFER TO MERCHANTS ACCEPTING OUR CARDS.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON THE FAST-GROWING RECURRING BILLING INDUSTRY THROUGH AUTOMATIC

BILL PAYMENT, A PRODUCT THAT ALLOWS MERCHANTS TO BILL CARDMEMBERS ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR RECURRING CHARGES SUCH AS INSURANCE PREMIUMS, NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTIONS, HEALTH CLUB MEMBERSHIPS, COMMUTATION COSTS AND CABLE TV SERVICE. WE HAVE ALSO MADE

MODIFICATIONS TO OUR HOST AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM TO APPROVE MORE TRANSACTIONS AND REDUCE CARDMEMBER INCONVENIENCE AT THE POINT-OF-SALE WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN FRAUD OR CREDIT LOSSES.

WHEREVER WE MANAGE BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS AND THE CARD-ISSUING SIDE OF THE BUSINESS THERE IS A CLOSED LOOP, WHICH

DISTINGUISHES OUR NETWORK FROM THE BANKCARD NETWORKS IN THAT THERE IS ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD TRANSACTION. WE MAINTAIN A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH OUR CARDMEMBERS AND OUR MERCHANTS, AND WE HANDLE ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THOSE

RELATIONSHIPS. OUR RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW US TO ANALYZE INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBERS SPEND. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH OUR

PRIVACY POLICY AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. WE PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS DATA, AND COMPLY WITH STRICT PRIVACY, FIREWALL AND APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CARD ISSUING BANK PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS

CLOSED LOOP, WHICH PERMITS THEM TO CUSTOMIZE MARKETING EFFORTS, DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO THEIR CARDMEMBERS AND HELP US TO DIRECT INCREASED BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT THE CARD.

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE OUR CLOSED LOOP STRUCTURE, SUCH AS VISAS RECENTLY-LAUNCHED VISA INCENTIVE NETWORK. ALTHOUGH IT

REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE VISA WILL BE, EFFORTS BY VISA AND OTHER CARD NETWORKS TO REPLICATE THE CLOSED LOOP SPEAK BOTH TO ITS VALUE, AS WELL AS THE INTENSE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WE HAVE CERTAIN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES THAT ARISE IF A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS SETTLED IN FAVOR

OF THE CARDMEMBER. DRIVERS

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF THIS LIABILITY ARE RETURNS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER FRAUDULENT CHARGES, THE QUALITY OR

NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, WE OFFSET THE AMOUNT DUE TO THE CARDMEMBER AGAINST THE MERCHANTS CURRENT OR FUTURE SUBMISSIONS FOR PAYMENT. WE CAN REALIZE LOSSES WHEN OFFSETTING SUBMISSIONS CEASE, SUCH AS WHEN

THE MERCHANT COMMENCES A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE RISK OF THIS EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN MERCHANT BY EITHER HOLDING

CASH RESERVES FUNDED THROUGH CASH HOLDBACKS FROM A MERCHANT OR LENGTHENING THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE MERCHANT SUBMITS A CHARGE FOR PAYMENT AND WHEN WE PAY THE MERCHANT. WE ALSO ESTABLISH RESERVES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES.

IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THIRD-PARTY PROCESSORS AND SOME BANKCARD ACQUIRERS HAVE

BEGUN TO OFFER MERCHANTS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVERTING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF THE CARDHOLDERS RESIDENCE (I.E., THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE POINT-OF-SALE, AND SUBMITTING THE

TRANSACTION IN THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS OF THE CARD NETWORK. THIS PRACTICE IS KNOWN AS DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION. IF A MERCHANT UTILIZES A DYNAMIC

CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS, THE MERCHANT AND PROCESSOR SHARE ANY FEE ASSESSED OR SPREAD EARNED FOR CONVERTING THE TRANSACTION AT THE POINT OF SALE, THUS REDUCING OR ELIMINATING REVENUE FOR CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION

OF FOREIGN CHARGES TO THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY. THIS PRACTICE IS NOT WIDESPREAD, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT CONSUMERS WILL PREFER TO HAVE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS CONVERTED BY MERCHANTS IN THIS WAY. OUR POLICY GENERALLY

REQUIRES MERCHANTS TO SUBMIT CHARGES AND BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND WE CONVERT THE TRANSACTION TO THE CARDMEMBERS BILLING CURRENCY. WE ARE CONTINUING TO REVIEW THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF DYNAMIC

CURRENCY CONVERSION, INCLUDING CONSIDERING WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT WE SHOULD DEVELOP OUR OWN DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS.

REGULATION

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE

OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA, MEXICO AND SWITZERLAND, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED, AND ARE CONTINUING TO CONDUCT, INVESTIGATIONS

INTO THE WAY BANKCARD NETWORK MEMBERS COLLECTIVELY SET THE INTERCHANGE, WHICH IS THE FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD-ISSUING BANK. THE INTERCHANGE FEE IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT

RATE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS BY THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR BANKCARD CHARGES. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS, GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE BANKCARD ASSOCIATIONS PRICING

COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. DOWNWARD MOVEMENT OF INTERCHANGE AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT FEES MAY AFFECT THE RELATIVE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS OF PARTICIPATION IN A PARTICULAR NETWORK. LOWER INTERCHANGE OR

MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS ANNUAL CARD FEES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS. IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE REGULATIONS HAVE FORCED OUR

COMPETITORS TO LOWER THEIR FEES, WE HAVE MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR OWN FEE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS TO REFLECT LOCAL COMPETITIVE TRENDS. FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCTIONS IN BANKCARD INTERCHANGE

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANDATED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA IN 2003 HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR VISA AND MASTERCARD.

AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, WE HAVE REDUCED OUR OWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES IN AUSTRALIA, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NEVERTHELESS BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE BILLED BUSINESS AND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING OUR CARDS. IN ADDITION, UNDER

LEGISLATION ENACTED IN ARGENTINA, A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS REQUIRED TO CHARGE THE SAME MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE TO ALL MERCHANTS IN THE SAME INDUSTRY CATEGORY, AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES CANNOT EXCEED 3%. IN THE EVENT GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY

ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

REGULATORS HAVE ALSO

CONSIDERED THE INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF PROHIBITING MERCHANTS FROM PASSING THE COST OF MERCHANT DISCOUNT FEES ALONG TO CONSUMERS THROUGH SURCHARGES ON CARD PURCHASES. ALTHOUGH SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND MORE RECENTLY, AUSTRALIA,

PERMIT MERCHANTS TO LEVY A SURCHARGE ON CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, THERE HAS TO DATE BEEN A RELATIVELY LOW OVERALL INCIDENCE OF SURCHARGING, AS MERCHANTS DO NOT WANT TO RISK OFFENDING CUSTOMERS OR LOSING THEM TO COMPETITORS THAT DO NOT ASSESS SURCHARGES

FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES.

CHARGE CARDS

OUR CHARGE CARDS, WHICH CARRY NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS

OR SERVICES. CHARGES ARE APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNT HISTORY, CREDIT RECORD AND PERSONAL RESOURCES. CARDMEMBERS GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH, AND NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE

ASSESSED. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE CANCELED. THE NO-PRESET-SPENDING LIMIT AND PAY-IN-FULL NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS ATTRACT

HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS WHO WANT TO USE A CHARGE CARD TO FACILITATE LARGER PAYMENTS.

THE SIGN & TRAVEL

PROGRAM GIVES QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF

EXTENDED PAYMENTS FOR AIRLINE, CRUISE AND CERTAIN TRAVEL CHARGES THAT ARE PURCHASED WITH OUR CHARGE CARDS. THE EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION OFFERS QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDING PAYMENT FOR CERTAIN CHARGES ON THE CHARGE CARD IN EXCESS

STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND CONTINUES TO GROW.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESPITE THE INCREASING COSTS OF THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM AS PENETRATION AND USAGE EXPAND, IT PLAYS

A VITAL ROLE IN OUR PROFITABILITY. THE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND LOYALTY. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THAT CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS PROGRAMS YIELD HIGHER SPEND, STRONGER CREDIT

PERFORMANCE AND GREATER PROFIT FOR US. FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD THROUGH THE END OF 2005, THE NUMBER OF CARDS ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM INCREASED BY 57% AND TOTAL SPENDING BY MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PARTICIPANTS INCREASED BY 77%. BY

OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES, WE HAVE GIVEN OUR CARDMEMBERS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THEIR REWARDS POINTS AND FAVORABLY AFFECTED OUR AVERAGE COST PER POINT. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO OPTIMIZE THE OVERALL ECONOMICS OF THE PROGRAM

AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS.

CARDMEMBER SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, OUR CARDMEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF FEE-FREE AND FEE-BASED SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CARDS

COMPETITION  CARD ISSUING BUSINESS

OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INTENSE COMPETITION. AS A

CARD ISSUER, WE COMPETE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIBANK, BANK OF AMERICA, JPMORGAN CHASE, MBNA AND CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL) THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE VISA AND/OR MASTERCARD ASSOCIATIONS AND THAT ISSUE GENERAL PURPOSE

CREDIT CARDS, PRIMARILY UNDER REVOLVING CREDIT PLANS, ON ONE OR BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS, AND THE MORGAN STANLEY AFFILIATE THAT ISSUES THE DISCOVER CARD ON THE DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES NETWORK. WE ALSO ENCOUNTER LIMITED COMPETITION FROM BUSINESSES

THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS ARE NOT GENERALLY SUBSTITUTES FOR OUR CARDS BECAUSE OF THEIR LIMITED ACCEPTANCE. BECAUSE OF CONTINUING

CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS AND THE LARGEST ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW USING THEIR GREATER

RESOURCES, ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND BRAND RECOGNITION TO COMPETE.

COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT

CARDHOLDERS INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT, AIRLINE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS, CASH REBATES AND OTHER REWARD OR REBATE PROGRAMS, TEASER PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CREDIT CARD

ACQUISITION AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND COBRANDED ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS.

MOST FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ALSO ISSUE DEBIT CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL PURPOSE

DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE VISA OR MASTERCARD LOGO. AS A RESULT, THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AND, IN THE UNITED STATES, HAS GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND

CHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS. DEBIT CARDS ARE MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH AND CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS ARE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS. THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE DEBIT CARDS FOR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS IS LIMITED

BECAUSE THE CONSUMER MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN HIS OR HER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TO COVER THE TRANSACTION IN QUESTION. FOR EXAMPLE, LARGER PURCHASES OR DELAYED PURCHASES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR DEBIT CARDS. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ISSUE

POINT-OF-SALE DEBIT CARDS FOR USE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS

ARE.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TRS, ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES

(CREDCO), PURCHASES THE MAJORITY OF CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE USE OF CARDS ISSUED IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN CERTAIN CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO FINANCES THE PURCHASE OF RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH

THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE SALE OF MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB FINANCE THEIR REVOLVING CREDIT RECEIVABLES, IN PART, THROUGH THE SALE OF SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT IN THE UNITED

STATES. TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ALSO FUND RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS. THE COST OF FUNDING CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR EXPENSE OF CARD OPERATIONS. (YOU CAN FIND A DISCUSSION OF TRS AND CENTURION

REGULATION

 CARD ISSUING BUSINESS

THE CHARGE CARD AND CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION. IN THE UNITED STATES,

THE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING.



THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (WHICH GENERALLY PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION IN THE GRANTING AND HANDLING OF CREDIT);



THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT AND THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT (FACT ACT) (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES USE BY CREDITORS OF CONSUMER CREDIT

REPORTS AND CREDIT PRESCREENING PRACTICES AND REQUIRES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES WHEN AN APPLICATION FOR CREDIT IS REJECTED);



THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT (TILA) (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS UPON WHICH CREDIT IS GRANTED), INCLUDING THE AMENDMENTS TO TILA

THAT WERE ADOPTED THROUGH THE ENACTMENT OF THE FAIR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD DISCLOSURE ACT (WHICH MANDATES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ON CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD APPLICATIONS);



THE FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES THE MANNER THAT BILLING INQUIRIES ARE HANDLED AND SPECIFIES CERTAIN BILLING REQUIREMENTS); AND



THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACT (WHICH REGULATES DISCLOSURES AND SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS INCLUDING THOSE AT ATMS).

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN FEDERAL PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER

INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SEE CORPORATE AND OTHER BELOW). FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE

OPERATE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION, DISCLOSURE AND PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES). THE APPLICATION OF BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS AFFECT US TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH

LAWS RESULT IN AMOUNTS OWED BEING CLASSIFIED AS DELINQUENT AND/OR CHARGED OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE. CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION, INCLUDING, IN THE UNITED STATES, THE USA PATRIOT ACT.

(FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS LEGISLATION AND ITS EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE CORPORATE AND OTHER BELOW.)

CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB

AND OUR OTHER BANK ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THEREOF COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR CARD AND LENDING BUSINESSES OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASING COMPLEX AND ROBUST. MORE RECENTLY, REGULATORS (AS WELL AS VARIOUS CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS)

HAVE BEGUN TO FOCUS INCREASING ATTENTION ON THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF FEES CHARGED BY CARD ISSUERS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LATE PAYMENTS, RETURNED CHECKS, PAYMENTS BY TELEPHONE, COPIES OF STATEMENTS AND THE LIKE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW AND, AS

APPROPRIATE, REFINE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL (THE FFIEC), AN INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF

THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE TO THE INDUSTRY ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES (THE GUIDANCE). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE AREAS.

(I) CREDIT LINE MANAGEMENT, (II) OVER-LIMIT PRACTICES, (III) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION PRACTICES, (IV) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES, AND (V) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES.

THE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT COMPRISE THE FFIEC, ALTHOUGH IT IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE IDENTIFICATION BY BANK REGULATORS IN THEIR EXAMINATIONS OF

OTHER CREDIT CARD LENDERS PRACTICES DEEMED BY THEM TO BE INAPPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, WITH REGARD TO SUBPRIME LENDING PROGRAMS. AT PRESENT, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY LENDING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE SUBPRIME MARKET. THE GUIDANCE HAS

NOT HAD ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES, AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE.

GLOBAL TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID SERVICES

WE HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF ISSUING AND SELLING

TRAVELERS CHECKS SINCE 1891. TODAY, THAT BUSINESS IS OPERATED THROUGH OUR GLOBAL TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID SERVICES GROUP (TCPS). TCPS ALSO ISSUES A VARIETY OF OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, INCLUDING GIFT CARDS, CHEQUES FOR TWO

®

, GIFT CHEQUES AND THE BE MY GUEST

®

DINING CARD. THROUGH OUR JOINT VENTURE WITH MARITZ

INC., AMERICAN EXPRESS INCENTIVE SERVICES L.L.C., WE OFFER VARIOUS INCENTIVE PREPAID PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE CORPORATE GIFT CHEQUE, THE INCENTIVE FUNDS CARD AND SEVERAL POINTS-BASED INCENTIVE CARDS.

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE SELL THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

TRAVELERS CHEQUE (TRAVELERS CHEQUE OR CHEQUE) AS A SAFE AND CONVENIENT ALTERNATIVE TO CASH. IT

HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE AND IS PAYABLE WHEN PRESENTED FOR THE PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR REDEMPTION. TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE AVAILABLE IN NINE CURRENCIES, INCLUDING EUROS. WE ALSO ISSUE AND SELL OTHER FORMS OF PAPER TRAVELERS CHECKS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

GIFT CHEQUES, AVAILABLE IN U.S.

AND CANADIAN DOLLARS, ARE DESIGNED FOR GIFT-GIVING IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, AND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CHEQUE-SECURE FUNDS, AVAILABLE IN DOLLARS AND EUROS, IS OFFERED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES AS A SAFE WAY TO KEEP CASH AT HOME.

IN 2005, TCPS CONTINUED TO OFFER TWO PREPAID GIFT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES: THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GIFT CARD (GIFT CARD), WHICH CAN BE USED

IN THE UNITED STATES AT RETAIL AND RESTAURANT ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND THE BE MY GUEST

®

CARD, SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR DINING AT ALL RESTAURANTS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. DURING 2005, TCPS EXPANDED SALES

OF GIFT CARDS THROUGH SHOPPING MALLS AND THOUSANDS OF RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS, INCLUDING MAJOR NATIONAL DRUG STORE AND SUPERMARKET CHAINS.

IN 2005, WE ALSO CONTINUED TO OFFER THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE CARD (TCC), A RELOADABLE, PREPAID CARD MARKETED AS A PLASTIC FORM OF OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUE. DURING 2005, THE TCC WAS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND

GERMANY, IN U.S. DOLLARS, BRITISH POUNDS STERLING AND EUROS, RESPECTIVELY, FOR USE WORLDWIDE, FOR BOTH ONLINE AND IN-PERSON PURCHASES AND AT ATMS (ATM FEES APPLY) THAT ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. TCC HOLDERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME CUSTOMER

SERVICE AND SECURITY PROVIDED TO HOLDERS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES, INCLUDING CARD REPLACEMENT OR REFUND IF THE CARD IS LOST OR STOLEN (USUALLY WITHIN 24 HOURS) AND PASSPORT REPLACEMENT AND CREDIT CARD CANCELLATION ASSISTANCE. BECAUSE THE CARD IS NOT

LINKED TO A BANK ACCOUNT AND PRE-LOADED FUNDS ARE REFUNDABLE, MANY CONSUMERS VIEW IT TO BE A SAFE PAYMENT OPTION FOR TRAVEL.

WE SELL

AMERICAN EXPRESS PAPER AND PLASTIC PREPAID CARD PRODUCTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS. WE SELL THESE PRODUCTS OURSELVES DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS VIA PHONE AND THE INTERNET. TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND GIFT CHEQUES ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH A BROAD NETWORK

OF SELLING OUTLETS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL OFFICES, INDEPENDENT TRAVEL AGENTS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND MANY OTHER FINANCIAL, TRAVEL AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THE SAME SELLERS ALSO SELL OUR PREPAID CARDS. WE

SOMETIMES COMPENSATE SELLING OUTLETS FOR THEIR SALES.

IN 2005, WE EXPANDED OUR GIFT CARD RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK SIGNIFICANTLY TO

INCLUDE MALLS AND LARGE NATIONAL RETAIL CHAINS  SUCH AS SAFEWAY SUPERMARKETS, ECKERD AND RITE AID PHARMACIES. THESE SELLERS DISPLAY OUR GIFT CARDS ON MERCHANDISE RACKS  A VERY DIFFERENT WAY FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS TO SELL CARDS.

PREPAID CARDS PROVIDE US WITH SEVERAL BENEFITS.



PREPAID CARDS OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUE BUSINESS MODEL. WE ARE DIVERSIFYING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, EXPANDING OUR SALES NETWORK, AND DIVERSIFYING OUR

REVENUE STREAMS. AS IN THE CASE OF A TRADITIONAL PAPER TRAVELERS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHEQUE, WE BENEFIT FROM THE FLOAT ON A PREPAID CARD. IN ADDITION, WE COLLECT PURCHASING FEES, RELOAD

FEES, DISCOUNT REVENUES, AND, WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SERVICE FEES.



PREPAID CARDS OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS INTO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FRANCHISE.

WE INVEST THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS ISSUED BY TRS PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY RATED DEBT SECURITIES CONSISTING

PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS.

REGULATION  TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND

PREPAID CARDS

AS AN ISSUER OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, WE ARE REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE MONEY TRANSMITTER LAWS OF

MOST STATES. THESE LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHECK (AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, PREPAID CARD) ISSUERS TO OBTAIN LICENSES, TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN HIGHLY RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO

PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. MANY STATES AUDIT LICENSEES ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION, TRAVELERS CHECK ISSUERS ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAWS OF MANY STATES TO COMPLY WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS UNDER WHICH ISSUERS MUST PAY TO STATES THE FACE

AMOUNT OF ANY TRAVELERS CHECK THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER 15 YEARS. A FEW STATES HAVE AMENDED THEIR ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS TO APPLY TO PREPAID CARDS. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, SOME STATES HAVE ENACTED LAWS PERTAINING TO THE ISSUANCE AND THE

SALE OF GIFT CARDS. SOME OF THESE LAWS RESTRICT THE FEES THAT CONSUMERS CAN BE CHARGED AND THE EXPIRATION DATES OF THE CARDS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA VERY CLOSELY TO ENSURE WE COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE

REGULATION, WHICH VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE. IN CERTAIN STATES WHERE REGULATION HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO OFFER GIFT CARDS PROFITABLY, WE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO LIMIT OR WITHDRAW FROM SELLING THESE CARDS. FEDERAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

REGULATIONS REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELER CHECK ISSUERS AS MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES AND COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING RECORDING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY ISSUERS AND SELLING OUTLETS. AT THIS TIME,

STORED VALUE ISSUERS AND REDEEMERS, WHILE CONSIDERED TO BE MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES, ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE VARYING LICENSING AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE

SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.

COMPETITION  TRAVELERS CHECKS AND PREPAID CARDS

TRAVELERS CHEQUES COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CASH, FOREIGN CURRENCY, CHECKS, OTHER BRANDS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS,

AND, INCREASINGLY, DEBIT AND ATM CARDS, AS WELL AS CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS (EVEN THOUGH TRAVELERS CHECKS AND PREPAID CARDS ARE NOT SUBSTITUTES FOR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS) AND, TO A LIMITED EXTENT, COMPETING PREPAID CARDS. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE

FACTORS AFFECTING THE TRAVELERS CHECK AND PREPAID CARD INDUSTRY ARE.



THE NUMBER AND LOCATION OF MERCHANTS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE FORM OF PAYMENT;



THE AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER OF OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT;



THE AMOUNT OF FEES CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER;



THE COMPENSATION PAID TO, AND FREQUENCY OF SETTLEMENT BY, SELLING OUTLETS;



THE ACCESSIBILITY OF SALES AND REFUNDS FOR THE PRODUCTS;

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS



THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; AND



THE ABILITY TO SERVICE THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTORILY, INCLUDING FOR LOST OR STOLEN INSTRUMENTS.

OUR PREPAID CARDS (CARDS THAT CAN BE USED AT MANY DIFFERENT UNAFFILIATED LOCATIONS) COMPETE WITH ALL OF THE SAME PAYMENT METHODS; HOWEVER, GIFT CARDS

COMPETE PRIMARILY WITH CASH, CHECKS AND STORE-SPECIFIC GIFT CARDS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK  USA

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK  USA PROVIDES TRAVEL, FINANCIAL AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH

AMERICAN EXPRESS-OWNED TRAVEL SERVICE OFFICES, CALL CENTERS AND PARTICIPATING AMERICAN EXPRESS REPRESENTATIVES (INDEPENDENTLY-OWNED TRAVEL AGENCY LOCATIONS THAT OPERATE UNDER THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND). U.S. CONSUMER TRAVEL HAS DISTINGUISHED ITSELF

IN THE LUXURY MARKETPLACE THROUGH ITS PLATINUM TRAVEL SERVICES AND CENTURION TRAVEL SERVICES, WHICH PROVIDE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE PROGRAM, WHICH OFFERS TWO-FOR-ONE FARES ON CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL FIRST AND BUSINESS CLASS TICKETS,

AND THE FINE HOTELS & RESORTS PROGRAM, A LUXURY HOTEL PROGRAM OFFERING ROOM UPGRADES AND VALUE-ADDED AMENITIES. OTHER PREMIUM PROGRAMS DEVELOPED BY CONSUMER TRAVEL FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARDMEMBERS INCLUDE CRUISE PRIVILEGES, CENTURION

AND PLATINUM DESTINATIONS VACATIONS AND THE PRIVATE JETS PROGRAM.

IN ADDITION, THE CONSUMER TRAVEL BUSINESS OPERATES A WHOLESALE TRAVEL

BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH OUR TRAVEL IMPRESSIONS SUBSIDIARY. (A WHOLESALER PURCHASES INVENTORY, SUCH AS HOTEL ROOMS, FROM SUPPLIERS AND THEN RESELLS THE SERVICES TO THE CUSTOMER AT RETAIL PRICES THAT THE WHOLESALER DETERMINES.) OUR

WHOLESALE TRAVEL BUSINESS PACKAGES AMERICAN EXPRESS VACATIONS AND DISTRIBUTES TRAVEL PACKAGES THROUGH OTHER RETAIL TRAVEL AGENTS AND PRIVATE LABEL BRANDS FOR THIRD PARTIES IN THE UNITED STATES. CONSUMER TRAVEL ALSO PROVIDES MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM CRUISE AND TOUR FULFILLMENT, FEE-FREE AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELERS CHEQUES, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES.

OUR CONSUMER TRAVEL WEB

SITE, AMERICANEXPRESS.COM/TRAVEL, WHICH IS OPERATED BY TRAVELOCITY, OFFERS CUSTOMIZED BOOKING TOOLS FOR CRUISES AND AMERICAN EXPRESS VACATIONS PACKAGES, LAST-MINUTE BARGAINS AND SPECIAL PROMOTIONAL OFFERS. IT ALSO OFFERS A FULL RANGE OF TRAVEL RATES

AND DISCOUNTS ON AIRFARES, HOTELS, LAST-MINUTE DEALS, AS WELL AS CRUISES AND FULL VACATION PACKAGES, WITH OPTIONAL TRANSFERS, SIGHT-SEEING TOURS AND INSURANCE. THE WEB SITE ALSO OFFERS AN AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL OFFICE LOCATOR AND TRAVEL SPECIALIST

FINDER TOOLS FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO PREFER TO BOOK THEIR TRAVEL OFFLINE. IN 2005, WE LAUNCHED A NEW FEATURE THAT ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS FOR SOME CATEGORIES OF TRAVEL THROUGH BOTH THIS WEB SITE AND OUR CALL CENTERS.

WE ALSO ATTRACTED

ELEVEN NEW MEMBERS WITH 62 LOCATIONS LAST YEAR TO OUR REPRESENTATIVE NETWORK, INCLUDING THE TRAVEL

AUTHORITY, INC., A REGIONAL TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANY SERVING INDIVIDUAL, CORPORATE AND GROUP TRAVELERS IN 45 LOCATIONS.

TRS

WORLDWIDE TRAVEL NETWORK OF MORE THAN 2,200 RETAIL TRAVEL LOCATIONS IS IMPORTANT IN SUPPORTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND PROVIDING CUSTOMER SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION  CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK  USA

AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR TRAVEL AGENTS, ONLINE TRAVEL AGENTS AND TRAVEL SUPPLIERS THAT

DISTRIBUTE THEIR PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS DIRECTLY VIA THE INTERNET OR TELEPHONE-BASED CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTERS. IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASING COMPETITION FROM ONLINE TRAVEL AGENTS UTILIZING THE MERCHANT BUSINESS MODEL, WHICH IS A

MODEL UNDER WHICH THE AGENT RECEIVES INVENTORY (HOTEL ROOMS, AIRLINE SEATS, CAR RENTALS, DESTINATION SERVICES) FROM SUPPLIERS AT NEGOTIATED RATES. THE AGENT THEN DETERMINES THE RETAIL PRICE PAID BY THE CUSTOMER AND PROCESSES THE TRANSACTIONS AS THE

MERCHANT OF RECORD FOR THE TRANSACTION. WE BELIEVE THE MERCHANT MODEL WAS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE DURING THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS WHEN TRAVEL VOLUMES WERE DEPRESSED AND SUPPLIERS TENDED TO MAKE GREATER AMOUNTS

OF THEIR INVENTORY AVAILABLE TO AGENCIES UTILIZING THIS MODEL.

NEW COMPETITION HAS ALSO EMERGED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS IN THE FORM OF

SEVERAL SOFTWARE COMPANIES THAT OFFER ROBOTIC SEARCHES OF OTHER WEB SITES TO DIRECT CONSUMERS TO THE SITE THAT OFFERS THE LOWEST PRICES ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOMERS SEARCH PARAMETERS.

INTERNATIONAL CARD & GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES

GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES

THROUGH OUR GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES (GCS) GROUP, WE PROVIDE EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO MORE THAN 100,000 FIRMS WORLDWIDE THROUGH OUR

CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM, CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS AND BUSINESS TRAVEL SERVICES. GCS IS BOTH THE LEADING ISSUER OF COMMERCIAL CARDS AND THE LARGEST CORPORATE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES, SERVING NEARLY 70% OF THE FORTUNE 500,

ALONG WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MID-SIZED COMPANIES. DURING 2005, WE ADDED OR RETAINED SEVERAL MAJOR CORPORATE CARD CLIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING PROCTER & GAMBLE, XEROX AND BEARING POINT. GCS OFFERS THREE

PRIMARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.



CORPORATE CARD, ISSUED TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGH A CORPORATE ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY THEIR EMPLOYER AND DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING;



CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS, AN ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY A COMPANY TO PAY FOR EVERYDAY BUSINESS EXPENSES SUCH AS OFFICE AND COMPUTER SUPPLIES; AND



BUSINESS TRAVEL, WHICH HELPS BUSINESSES MANAGE THEIR TRAVEL EXPENSES THROUGH A VARIETY OF TRAVEL-RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

CORPORATE CARD AND CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

CORPORATE CARD IS A CHARGE CARD THAT INDIVIDUALS MAY OBTAIN THROUGH A CORPORATE ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY THEIR EMPLOYER FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. THROUGH THE CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM, COMPANIES CAN MANAGE THEIR TRAVEL,

ENTERTAINMENT AND PURCHASING EXPENSES AND IMPROVE NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE WITH SUPPLIERS, AMONG OTHER BENEFITS. WE USE OUR DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS TO OFFER CORPORATE CARD CLIENTS SUPERIOR DATA ABOUT COMPANY SPENDING, AS WELL AS STREAMLINED

DISPUTE RESOLUTION. WE ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CORPORATE CARDS IN 36 COUNTRIES, WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE THROUGH PROPRIETARY OPERATIONS AND PARTNER BANKS, AND INTERNATIONAL DOLLAR CORPORATE CARDS IN 85 COUNTRIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2005, WE ANNOUNCED THE RENEWAL AND EXPANSION OF THE BRITISH AIRWAYS AMERICAN EXPRESS CORPORATE CARD

PROGRAM, INCLUDING THE LAUNCH OF A NEW COBRAND CORPORATE CARD TARGETED AT SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. THIS NEW CORPORATE COBRAND ADDS TO THE EXISTING COBRANDED BRITISH AIRWAYS AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CARDS TARGETED AT THE CONSUMER MARKET.

CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS (CPS) HELPS LARGE AND MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES MANAGE THEIR EVERYDAY SPENDING. CPS IS USED BY

CORPORATIONS TO BUY EVERYDAY GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES AND INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT, IN 24 MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS TYPE OF SPENDING BY CORPORATIONS IS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS THAN TRADITIONAL TRAVEL

AND ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING AND HELPS DIVERSIFY THE SPENDING MIX ON OUR CARDS.

GCS IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO

GLOBAL, MULTINATIONAL AND LARGE BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE. GCS ESTABLISHED THE GLOBAL BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS GROUP, WHICH SERVES A HIGHLY SELECT GROUP OF FORTUNE 100 COMPANIES THAT HAVE GLOBALIZED THEIR APPROACH TO TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSE

MANAGEMENT AND HAVE STRUCTURED THEIR PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS IN A GLOBAL MANNER TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND OPTIMIZE THEIR INVESTMENTS IN TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT, AS WELL AS EVERYDAY CORPORATE EXPENSES.

IN ADDITION, OUR GCS BUSINESS PROVIDES CORPORATE CARD AND TRAVEL EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES (DEFINED IN THE UNITED STATES AS

FIRMS WITH ANNUAL REVENUES OF $10 MILLION TO $1 BILLION) WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, SWEDEN, GERMANY, AUSTRALIA, SINGAPORE, MEXICO AND INDIA. GCS IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS WITH

MIDSIZE COMPANIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE PRESENT US WITH SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. BUSINESSES OF THIS SIZE OFTEN DO NOT HAVE CORPORATE CARD PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, ONCE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM, MIDSIZED COMPANIES, WHICH USUALLY DO NOT HAVE

WELL-DEFINED PURCHASING PROGRAMS, WILL TYPICALLY PUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR BUSINESS SPENDING (BOTH TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT AND NON-T&E, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES) ON THE CARD BECAUSE THEY CAN GAIN CONTROL, SAVINGS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

IN 2005, OUR GCS BUSINESS INVESTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF MARKETING PROGRAMS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS, AND ADDED SALES STAFF TO GENERATE MORE CARD AND TRAVEL BUSINESS WITH MIDSIZE FIRMS. IN SUPPORT OF THIS STRATEGY, GCS OFFERS THE SAVINGS AT

WORK

SM

PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS SIMILAR PROGRAMS GLOBALLY, WHICH PROVIDE COMPANIES WITH DISCOUNTS ON

EVERYDAY BUSINESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS CAR RENTALS, HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS.

WITH THE INCREASED FOCUS ON COST CONTAINMENT BY

FIRMS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN THE CORPORATE MEETING CARD, WHICH HELPS BOTH U.S.-BASED AND INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES CONTROL COMPANY MEETING EXPENSES. THE CORPORATE MEETING CARD PROVIDES CLIENTS WITH A TOOL TO

CAPTURE SUCH SPENDING AND PROVIDES COMPANY MEETING PLANNERS WITH A TOOL TO SIMPLIFY THE MEETINGS PAYMENT PROCESS AND ACCESS TO DATA TO NEGOTIATE WITH SUPPLIERS. GCS ALSO OFFERS THE CORPORATE DEFINED EXPENSE PROGRAM. THIS PRODUCT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO

DURING 2005 WE ALSO PARTNERED WITH A GROUP OF MAJOR HOTEL COMPANIES IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE,

INCLUDING HILTON, HILTON INTERNATIONAL AND MARRIOTT, TO OFFER OUR CORPORATE CLIENTS SECURE WEB-BASED ACCESS TO ENHANCED DATA REGARDING THEIR EMPLOYEES LODGING SPEND.

GCS ALSO OFFERS AMERICAN EXPRESS @ WORK

ACCESS MANAGEMENT REPORTS ON A 24/7 BASIS THROUGH A SINGLE USER INTERFACE. THIS SUITE HELPS COMPANIES MANAGE EXPENSES AND MANIPULATE SPEND DATA MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN OFFLINE ALTERNATIVES, WHILE DECREASING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICING. THESE

PRODUCTS ENABLE COMPANIES TO REVIEW, COMBINE AND MANIPULATE CORPORATE CARD, CORPORATE TRAVEL AND CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS DATA. ONE OF THE PRODUCTS ALSO ALLOWS COMPANIES TO RECONCILE THE DATA WITH ITS INTERNAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

COMPETITION  GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS

COMPETITION IN THE COMMERCIAL CARD (CORPORATE CARD AND CPS) BUSINESS IS INCREASINGLY INTENSE AT BOTH THE CARD NETWORK AND CARD ISSUER LEVELS. AT THE NETWORK LEVEL, DINERS CLUB (WHICH, AS MENTIONED ABOVE, HAS BEEN

FOLDED INTO THE NETWORK OPERATED BY MASTERCARD IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA) REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL COMPETITOR. IN ADDITION, BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE INCREASED EFFORTS TO SUPPORT CARD ISSUERS SUCH AS U.S. BANK, JPMORGAN CHASE, GE

CAPITAL FINANCIAL INC. AND CITIBANK (IN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY), WHO ARE WILLING TO BUILD AND SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING NECESSARY TO SATISFY CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, MASTERCARD HAS PROMOTED ENHANCED WEB-BASED

SUPPORT FOR ITS CORPORATE CARD ISSUING MEMBERS, AND VISA INTERNATIONAL SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF A JOINT VENTURE BY A NUMBER OF ITS MEMBER BANKS FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO COMPETE AGAINST US AND DINERS CLUB FOR THE BUSINESS OF MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES.

THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS ARE, IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS CITED ABOVE UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES  COMPETITION  CARD ISSUING BUSINESS;



THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE AND DELIVER DETAILED TRANSACTION DATA AND EXPENSE MANAGEMENT REPORTS;



THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARDS;



PRICING;



THE RANGE AND INNOVATIVENESS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO SUIT BUSINESS NEEDS;



QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICES; AND



GLOBAL PRESENCE.

INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARD BUSINESS

WE ISSUE OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS IN NUMEROUS COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE. ALTHOUGH OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IS WIDESPREAD, WE

TRS CONTINUED TO BOLSTER ITS INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF NUMEROUS NEW OR ENHANCED CARD PRODUCTS DURING 2005. THESE ARE

CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, EITHER ON

WE OFFER MANY OF THE SAME PROGRAMS IN OUR INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS AS WE DO IN OUR U.S. PROPRIETARY ISSUING BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE,

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE OFFER VARIOUS FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS SIMILAR TO OUR SIGN & TRAVEL PROGRAM AND OUR EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION TO CARDMEMBERS IN SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

ALSO, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ISSUE CARDS INTERNATIONALLY UNDER DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH BANKS. SEE U.S. CARD SERVICES  BANK

DISTRIBUTION OF PROPRIETARY CARDS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THESE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS IS AFFINITY CARDS WITH FRATERNAL, PROFESSIONAL, EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE

BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PENETRATING THE AFFINITY CARD SEGMENT IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE WE ISSUE CARDS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGEST PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THAT COUNTRY. IN AUSTRALIA, AFFINITY CARDS ARE A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR TOTAL REVOLVING

PORTFOLIO AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR PROPRIETARY CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES.

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, REWARDS PROGRAMS ARE A STRONG

DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER BUSINESS. WE HAVE MORE THAN 1,200 REDEMPTION PARTNERS ACROSS OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WITH AN AVERAGE OF 70 PARTNERS IN EACH COUNTRY; FEWER THAN 30% OF THESE PARTNERS ARE IN THE TRAVEL

INDUSTRY. CARDMEMBERS CAN REDEEM THEIR POINTS WITH MORE THAN 25 AIRLINES AND 28 HOTEL CHAINS. OUR REDEMPTION OPTIONS INCLUDE TRAVEL, RETAIL MERCHANDISE, ENTERTAINMENT, SHOPPING AND RECREATION GIFT CERTIFICATES, EXPERIENCES, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND

CHARITY REWARDS. IN 2005, WE SIGNED OVER 200 NEW MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PARTNERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR REWARDS PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL MARKETS, OFFERING MORE FLEXIBLE CHOICES THAT ENABLE CARDMEMBERS TO REDEEM POINTS MORE

QUICKLY. SIGNIFICANTLY, IN SELECTED MARKETS WE LAUNCHED TRAVELKEY, WHICH ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO BOOK FLIGHTS AND VACATIONS WITH VIRTUALLY ANY AIRLINE TO ANY DESTINATION WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS, AND ENHANCED THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS WEB SITE TO OFFER

EASIER ONLINE REDEMPTION.

2005. IN THE UNITED STATES, 36% OF ALL OF GCS BUSINESS TRAVEL TRANSACTIONS WERE PROCESSED ONLINE, AND WHILE LOWER THAN IN THE UNITED STATES, ONLINE PENETRATION RATES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, MEXICO AND AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN

RECENT YEARS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESS HAS A PRESENCE IN MANY OF OUR TRAVEL OFFICES, AS WELL AS IN PROPRIETARY STANDALONE BUREAUS LOCATED IN SEVERAL MAJOR CITIES. ON A SELECTIVE BASIS, AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS DIVESTED SOME OF THESE PROPRIETARY LOCATIONS AND

CONCENTRATED THE RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESS IN 17 OF THE WORLDS MAJOR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS, INCLUDING LONDONS HEATHROW, THE AEROPORTS DE PARIS AND CHANGI AIRPORT IN SINGAPORE. FOR CORPORATE CLIENTS, OUR INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS

ONLINE PAYMENT PRODUCT ALLOWS COMPANIES AND BANKS TO MAKE CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS IN MORE THAN 35 FOREIGN CURRENCIES AT COMPETITIVE EXCHANGE RATES. WHOLESALE BANKNOTE SERVICES ARE ALSO PROVIDED TO SELECT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND TRAVEL-RELATED

COMPANIES.

COMPETITION  GLOBAL TRAVEL SERVICES

BUSINESS TRAVEL CONTINUES TO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FROM NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT

COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS. COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE, CONVENIENCE, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER. IN 2005, BUSINESS TRAVEL

WAS IMPACTED BY INCREASINGLY INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION, AS WELL AS THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, COMPETITION COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES, AS SOME COMPANIES HAVE BECOME ACCREDITED AS IN-HOUSE CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS.

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN JANUARY 2006, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE ANNOUNCED TO THE OWNERSHIP AND NETWORK STRUCTURE OF THREE OF

THE MAJOR TRADITIONAL TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES  BUSINESS TRAVEL INTERNATIONAL, TQ3 AND NAVIGANT INTERNATIONAL, INC.  REALIGNING THE SHAPE OF THE INDUSTRY. SIMILARLY, SOME OF THE MAJOR ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES ALSO

STRUCTURALLY CHANGED IN 2005 AS CENDANT CORP. INTEGRATED ORBITZ WITH TRAVELPORT, ITS TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND INTERACTIVE CORP. SPUN OFF EXPEDIA, INC. MORE CHANGE IN THE INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW. EACH OF THESE CHANGES TO THE COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT IN THE INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS THAT COULD HAVE A COMPETITIVE IMPACT.

IN 2005, U.S.-BASED

ONLINE TRAVEL AGENCIES CONTINUED TO EXPAND THEIR OFFERINGS AND MARKETING EFFORTS BEYOND THEIR TRADITIONAL TARGET CUSTOMER SET, WITH INCREASING FOCUS ON CORPORATE TRAVEL. ORBITZ/TRAVELPORT, EXPEDIA AND TRAVELOCITY HAVE ALL BEGUN TO PURSUE MIDSIZED

AND LARGER CORPORATE TRAVEL CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THE ONLINE AGENCIES EFFORTS TO PENETRATE THE MANAGED CORPORATE TRAVEL SECTOR HAS TO DATE OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES, IT IS LIKELY THAT THEY WILL FOCUS MORE OF

THEIR EFFORTS TO EXPAND INTO KEY, DEVELOPED INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN THE FUTURE.

SINCE 1995, TRAVEL AGENTS HAVE RECEIVED REDUCED LEVELS OF

REVENUE FROM AIRLINES, AND THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN UNDER SEVERE FINANCIAL PRESSURE IN RECENT YEARS AND, AS A RESULT, HAS INCREASED ITS EFFORTS TO REDUCE DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES. IN MARCH 2002, U.S. AIRLINES

AND SOME INTERNATIONAL CARRIERS STOPPED PAYING BASE COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA ON ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL. SUBSEQUENTLY, AIRLINES IN MANY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FOLLOWED

SUIT. IN ADDITION, LOW-COST CARRIERS HAVE BEGUN TO TARGET BUSINESS TRAVELERS TO HELP FUEL THEIR GROWTH, PUTTING FURTHER STRAIN ON THE ABILITY OF THE TRADITIONAL CARRIERS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. LOW-COST CARRIERS DO NOT RELY ON TRAVEL AGENTS TO

DISTRIBUTE THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE TRADITIONAL CARRIERS HAVE ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THEY BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR WEB SITES AND OTHER MEANS. THESE TRENDS HAVE REDUCED THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL AGENTS BECAUSE

THEY DO NOT RECEIVE DISTRIBUTION REVENUE FROM DIRECTLY BOOKED TRANSACTIONS.

OVERALL, INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT

COMPANIES, THE ONGOING TRENDS OF AIRLINE DIRECT SALES, RISE OF LOW-COST CARRIERS AND ONGOING REDUCTIONS IN OR ELIMINATION OF AIRLINE COMMISSIONS AND FEES CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON REVENUE FOR TRAVEL AGENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR

BUSINESS MODEL OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, TRANSITIONING MANY OF OUR SERVICES ONLINE AND REDUCING OTHER COSTS, AND OUR GLOBAL PRESENCE HAVE HELPED US TO BALANCE THESE REVENUE PRESSURES.

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (AEB) SERVES AFFLUENT AND HIGH NET WORTH

INDIVIDUALS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THROUGH OVER 70 LOCATIONS IN 45 COUNTRIES AND REGIONS WORLDWIDE. AEBS OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD., AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AEB

SERVES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE AND INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATING TO AEB GENERALLY DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN U.S.- AND NON-U.S.-BASED ACTIVITIES.

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AEBS TWO PRIMARY BUSINESS LINES ARE GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT (GWM), WHICH INCORPORATES

THE PRIVATE BANK AND FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES, AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GROUP (FIG). THE PRIVATE BANK FOCUSES ON DELIVERING AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, TRUST AND ESTATE PLANNING AND BANKING SERVICES, INCLUDING

SECURED LENDING, TO HIGH NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS. FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES PROVIDES A WIDE VARIETY OF LOCAL, DOMESTIC SAVING AND INVESTMENT PRODUCTS TO AFFLUENT INDIVIDUALS IN HONG KONG, SINGAPORE, INDIA, MEXICO, INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES AND

GERMANY.

FIG PROVIDES FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF CORRESPONDENT BANKING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS

PROCESSING (WIRE TRANSFERS AND CHECKS), TRADE-RELATED PAYMENTS AND FINANCING, CASH MANAGEMENT, LOANS, EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT AND INVESTMENT PRODUCTS. AEB ALSO DISTRIBUTES MUTUAL FUNDS THROUGH ITS FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS. IN ADDITION, AEB

PROVIDES TREASURY AND CAPITAL MARKET PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING FOREIGN EXCHANGE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTIONS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES AND INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AEB HAS UNDERTAKEN A STRATEGY OF EXITING ITS CORPORATE BANKING BUSINESS TO FOCUS ON GROWING ITS CONSUMER AND FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS BUSINESSES. CORPORATE CLIENTS NOW REPRESENT LESS THAN 1% OF AEBS TOTAL LOAN PORTFOLIO. THESE CHANGES ALIGN AEBS BUSINESSES MORE CLOSELY WITH THOSE OF OUR OTHER BUSINESS UNITS AND POSITION AEB TO PLAY A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN

THE DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES ON A GLOBAL BASIS.

AEB CONTINUES TO WORK WITH OTHER PARTS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS TO CROSS-SELL A RANGE OF

PAYMENT, LENDING AND FINANCIAL SERVICE PRODUCTS AND BUILD DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. AEB MARKETS ITS PRIVATE BANK SERVICES TO A HIGHLY SELECTIVE GROUP OF CARDMEMBERS OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. AEB OFFERS CREDIT PRODUCTS SUCH AS INSTALLMENT LOANS AND REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT TO BOTH CARDMEMBERS AND NON-CARDMEMBERS IN GERMANY, UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, MEXICO, HONG KONG, INDIA, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, SINGAPORE AND TAIWAN. AEB ALSO

ISSUES DEPOSIT CERTIFICATES DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, EUROS, POUNDS STERLING AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL DEPOSIT COMPANY IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS.

AEBS WORLDWIDE HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY. IT MAINTAINS AN INTERNATIONAL BANKING AGENCY IN NEW YORK CITY AND FACILITY OFFICES IN SAN

FRANCISCO, SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA. ITS WHOLLY OWNED EDGE ACT SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK INTERNATIONAL (AEBI), IS HEADQUARTERED IN MIAMI, FLORIDA, AND HAS BRANCHES IN NEW YORK CITY AND MIAMI.

RISKS  BANKING SERVICES

THE GLOBAL NATURE OF AEBS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IS SUCH THAT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT TO GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS ARE NOT UNUSUAL. AEB CONTINUALLY MONITORS AND ACTIVELY MANAGES ITS CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS TO REDUCE THE

ASSOCIATED RISK. THE PRIVATE BANKS LOANS ARE GENERALLY SECURED BY LIQUID, MARKETABLE COLLATERAL. FIG CONTROLS ITS EXPOSURES BY GENERALLY LIMITING ITS RELATIONSHIPS TO THE TOP TIER BANKS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS AND BY

CAPITALIZING ON ITS EXPERTISE IN

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRADE CREDIT, WHICH GENERALLY HAS A LOWER RISK PROFILE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, AEB HAD SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN

CERTAIN ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY REPRESENTED BY DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES, LOANS, FORWARD CONTRACTS, CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT (STANDBY AND COMMERCIAL) AND GUARANTEES. THE

COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WERE PRIMARILY UNRELATED TO AEB, AND PRINCIPALLY CONSISTED OF CONSUMERS TO WHOM AEB HAS EXTENDED LOANS, BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OPERATING GEOGRAPHICALLY

WITHIN THE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION, EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA, LATIN AMERICA, THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT AND MIDDLE EAST/AFRICA.

AEBS EARNINGS

ARE SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATES BECAUSE THE MATURITY OF LIABILITIES DOES NOT, GENERALLY, MATCH THE MATURITY OF ASSETS. AEB INVESTS EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN HIGH GRADE FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND MAINTAINS MANDATORY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS IN A

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AS REQUIRED BY CENTRAL BANKS. AEB MONITORS AND CONTROLS INTEREST RATE RISK THROUGH A RIGOROUS EARNINGS AT RISK PROCESS BOTH ON A COUNTRY AND GLOBAL LEVEL. AEB MANAGES THE DURATION/MATURITY MISMATCH OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

THROUGH ADJUSTING THE DURATION/MATURITY OF ASSETS AND/OR BY USING DERIVATIVES. ON OCCASION, AEB MAY DECIDE TO MISMATCH IN ANTICIPATION OF A CHANGE IN FUTURE INTEREST RATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDELINES. AEB SELLS FOREIGN EXCHANGE, INTEREST RATE AND

EQUITY PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND MAY DECIDE TO TAKE SHORT-TERM PROPRIETARY TRADING POSITIONS AS A RESULT OF THIS BUSINESS. THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE, INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY RISK IS MANAGED AT THE BRANCH AND GLOBAL LEVEL THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE

VALUE AT RISK PROCESS. AEB MANAGES COUNTERPARTY CREDIT EXPOSURE ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES THROUGH A DYNAMIC MARK-TO-MARKET AND POTENTIAL FUTURE EXPOSURE PROCESS, IN WHICH THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE EXPOSURE

ARE CALCULATED AND MANAGED AGAINST COUNTERPARTY LOAN EQUIVALENT LIMITS. YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION ON AEBS MANAGEMENT OF ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK AND USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS UNDER THE CAPTION AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY

RISK MANAGEMENT  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND IN NOTE 10 TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 44-45 AND PAGES 83-84, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS OF SUCH

REPORTS ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

BECAUSE AEB CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS IN EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES AND IN

COUNTRIES THAT ARE LESS POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY STABLE THAN THE UNITED STATES OR THOSE IN WESTERN EUROPE, ITS PRIVATE BANKING, FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND FIG ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO GREATER CREDIT AND COMPLIANCE RISKS THAN ARE FOUND

IN MORE WELL-DEVELOPED JURISDICTIONS. AEB CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, AND REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS CLIENT BASE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL LEGAL RISKS AS A RESULT OF CLIENTS USE OF AEBS BANKING SERVICES.

COMPETITION  BANKING SERVICES

THE BANKING SERVICES OF AEB ARE SUBJECT TO VIGOROUS COMPETITION EVERYWHERE AEB OPERATES. COMPETITORS INCLUDE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL BANKS WHOSE ASSETS

OFTEN EXCEED THOSE OF AEB, OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF OURS) AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATION  BANKING SERVICES

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANKING CORP. (AEBC) IS A NEW YORK INVESTMENT COMPANY ORGANIZED UNDER ARTICLE XII OF THE NEW YORK BANKING LAW AND IS A

WHOLLY OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN EXPRESS. AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. (AEBL) IS A WHOLLY OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF AEBC. AEBC, AEBL AND AEBLS GLOBAL NETWORK OF OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO CONTINUOUS

SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT (NYSBD) PURSUANT TO THE NEW YORK BANKING LAW. AEBC DOES NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN BANKING ACTIVITIES. AEBLS BRANCHES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE

LICENSED AND REGULATED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LOCAL REQUIREMENTS AS OTHER COMPETITORS THAT HAVE THE SAME LICENSE.

SINCE AEBC AND AEBL DO NOT DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, EXCEPT AS MAY BE INCIDENTAL TO THEIR ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, OUR AFFILIATION

WITH AEBC AND AEBL NEITHER CAUSES US TO BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED, NOR REQUIRES US TO REGISTER AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER REGULATION Y PROMULGATED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD). AEBC AND AEBL ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION BY THE FDIC, AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE COMPETITIVE EQUALITY BANKING

ACT OF 1987 OTHER THAN ANTI-TIE-IN RULES WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES. AEBC AND AEBL ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT.

THE NYSBD REQUIRES AEBC, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, TO MONITOR ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND MAINTAIN RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH

MINIMUM THRESHOLDS ESTABLISHED BY THE NYSBD. AT YEAR-END 2005, AEB HAD TIER ONE, TOTAL AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL (AS THOSE TERMS ARE DEFINED UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARDS RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES) THAT EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM STANDARDS

ESTABLISHED BY THE NYSBD. ADDITIONALLY, AEB IS NOT ANTICIPATED TO BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS WITH THE ADVANCED INTERNAL RATINGS BASED APPROACH INCORPORATED IN THE BASEL II CAPITAL ACCORD FRAMEWORK PUBLISHED IN JUNE, 2004. AEB

MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL II CAPITAL ACCORD IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE ITS BRANCH AND SUBSIDIARY NETWORK IS LOCATED.

IN RECENT YEARS, U.S. AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, TOGETHER WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE RAISED INCREASING CONCERNS OVER THE ABILITY OF CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CORRUPT PERSONS TO USE GLOBAL

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES TO FACILITATE MONEY LAUNDERING. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE PATRIOT ACT) THAT SPECIFICALLY IMPACT CERTAIN MONEY

LAUNDERING PREVENTION ACTIVITIES OF ENTITIES INVOLVED, AS AEBL IS, IN CORRESPONDENT AND PRIVATE BANKING ACTIVITIES. COMPLIANCE EFFORTS TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING REMAIN A HIGH PRIORITY FOR AEBL AND IT MAY INCREASE THESE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS FURTHER

REGULATIONS EXPECTED UNDER THE PATRIOT ACT AS WELL AS OTHER EVOLVING SUPERVISORY STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH AEBL DOES BUSINESS.

SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE

WE CONTINUE TO

MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, IN OUR CARD SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW FASTER INTRODUCTION AND GREATER CUSTOMIZATION OF PRODUCTS. WE ALSO ARE USING TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICE

CAPABILITIES TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER A HIGH QUALITY CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAINTAIN A SERVICE DELIVERY PLATFORM THAT OUR EMPLOYEES USE IN THE CARD BUSINESS TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER SERVICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

SUCH AS ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE, UPDATING OF CARDMEMBER INFORMATION, THE ADDITION OF NEW CARDS TO AN ACCOUNT AND RESOLVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ISSUES. IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE ARE BUILDING FLEXIBILITY AND ENHANCING OUR GLOBAL PLATFORMS AND

CAPABILITIES IN REVOLVING CREDIT, OUR FULL SERVICE BANKING PLATFORM CALLED WEALTHVIEW, AND CONSUMER PAYMENT OPTIONS.

WE CONTINUED TO

LEVERAGE THE INTERNET TO LOWER COSTS AND IMPROVE SERVICE QUALITY. DURING 2005, WE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF SERVICES AND CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS ONLINE AND INCREASED THEIR UTILIZATION. FOR EXAMPLE, WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY

80% OF OUR CARD SERVICING CALL VOLUME CAN NOW BE HANDLED ONLINE. WE NOW HAVE MORE ONLINE INTERACTIONS WITH U.S. CUSTOMERS THAN WE DO BY TELEPHONE OR IN PERSON. OUR ONLINE CARD SALES GREW STEADILY IN 2005 AS WELL.

USERS.

IN 2002, WE OUTSOURCED MOST OF OUR TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS WORK TO IBM. THIS ARRANGEMENT, WHICH HAS A SEVEN-YEAR TERM WITH OPTIONS TO

EXTEND, ENABLES US TO BENEFIT FROM IBMS EXPERTISE WHILE LOWERING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS. IBM HAS TAKEN ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANAGING MOST OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING MAINFRAME, MIDRANGE AND DESKTOP

SYSTEMS; WEB HOSTING; DATABASE ADMINISTRATION; HELP DESK SERVICES AND DATA CENTER OPERATIONS. OUR INTERNAL IT ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO RETAIN THE COMPANYS TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCIES, INCLUDING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY, INFORMATION

SECURITY, MANAGING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH TECHNOLOGIES PARTNERS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING APPLICATIONS AND DATABASES AND MANAGING THE TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIOS OF OUR BUSINESSES.

WE ARE ALSO, FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES, EXPLORING WAYS TO EXPLOIT CERTAIN PROPRIETARY APPLICATIONS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED. IN 2005, WE ENTERED INTO AN

ADOPTED SUCH LEGISLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2003 CALIFORNIA ENACTED THAT STATES FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT. WE WILL CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND OUR INTERNAL DATA

PROTECTION POLICIES, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT, WHILE SEEKING TO COLLECT AND USE DATA PROPERLY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.

THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT OF 1970 (FCRA) REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER

COMPANIES. FCRA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED BY THE ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2003 OF THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT (THE FACT ACT). THE FACT ACT REQUIRES ANY COMPANY THAT RECEIVES INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN

AFFILIATE TO PERMIT THE CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM HAVING THAT INFORMATION USED TO MARKET THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. THE FACT ACT FURTHER AMENDS THE FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT OR DECREASE IDENTITY THEFT

AND TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CONSUMER CREDIT INFORMATION. NEW DUTIES ARE IMPOSED ON BOTH CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND ON BUSINESSES THAT FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FURNISHER OF INFORMATION IS

REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO PREVENT THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE RESULT OF IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO, IF A CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, THE FURNISHER OF THAT

INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A TIMELY FASHION. THE FACT ACT ALSO REQUIRES GRANTORS OF CREDIT THAT USE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO OFFER A BORROWER CREDIT ON TERMS THAT

ARE MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE TERMS OFFERED TO MOST OF THE LENDERS OTHER CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE BORROWER THAT THE TERMS ARE BASED ON A CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. IN SUCH A CASE THE BORROWER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A FREE COPY

OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. BEGINNING AUGUST 1, 2005, GRANTORS OF CREDIT USING PRE-SCREENED CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN CREDIT SOLICITATIONS WERE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE AN ENHANCED NOTICE TO CONSUMERS THAT THEY HAVE

THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT FROM RECEIVING FURTHER PRE-SCREENED OFFERS OF CREDIT. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF THE FACT ACT AND THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE

PERSONALIZED SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 WAS ENACTED IN OCTOBER 2001 IN THE WAKE OF THE

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS. THE PATRIOT ACT SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENED EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND THE EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITED STATES. THE PATRIOT ACT CONTAINS A WIDE VARIETY OF PROVISIONS AIMED AT FIGHTING TERRORISM, INCLUDING PROVISIONS AIMED AT IMPEDING TERRORISTS

ABILITY TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PATRIOT ACT REQUIRES FEDERAL REGULATORS, LED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, TO REGULATE OR TAKE OTHER STEPS TO REQUIRE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO

ESTABLISH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS. WHILE AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS LONG MAINTAINED ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS IN OUR

BUSINESSES, THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS UNDER THE PATRIOT ACT APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED WITHIN AEB, TRS AND THEIR AFFILIATES, PRESCRIBING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SUCH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

PROGRAMS, AND WE HAVE ENHANCED EXISTING PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED NEW ONES IN RESPONSE TO THESE NEW REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN APRIL 2002, THE U.S. TREASURY ISSUED DRAFT REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OPERATORS OF CREDIT CARD NETWORKS

(SUCH AS VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB, DISCOVER AND AMERICAN EXPRESS) THAT WOULD REQUIRE CREDIT CARD NETWORKS TO HAVE RISK-BASED PROGRAMS TO SCREEN INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE CARDS OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THEIR NETWORKS. AS A RESULT,

WE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM FOR OUR GNS BUSINESS, AND IN 2004 COMPLETED OUR SCREENING OF EXISTING LICENSED INSTITUTIONS AND WILL APPLY THE SCREENING UNDER THIS PROGRAM TO ALL NEW LICENSING RELATIONSHIPS. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AND

IMPLEMENTED A CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM APPLICABLE TO MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, AND HAVE ENHANCED OUR KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER AND ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAMS IN OTHERS. WE INTEND TO TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE

ADOPTED. IN ADDITION, WE WILL TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING INITIATIVES ADOPTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF REGULATED BUSINESSES. WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EU LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS IN THE OTHER MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, TO ENSURE THAT

WE ARE IN A POSITION TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES APPLICABLE TO CREDIT INSTITUTIONS, INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS,

TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC

REGION, SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON PAGES

95-98 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.) OUR REVENUES CAN BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY CARDMEMBERS

WHO ARE BILLED IN OTHER THAN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCY, AND FOR THE REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES). FOR EXAMPLE, IN FEBRUARY 2006, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED THE ISSUANCE OF NEW CARDS IN TAIWAN DUE TO CONCERNS

OVER RISING BAD DEBTS THROUGHOUT TAIWANS CONSUMER FINANCE INDUSTRY. SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF THE CARD IN CONNECTION WITH

SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY. THE MAJORITY OF AEBS REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM BUSINESS CONDUCTED IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SOME OF THE RISKS ATTENDANT TO THOSE OPERATIONS INCLUDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN

POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS IN EACH SUCH COUNTRY.

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS A RESULT OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT, BECAUSE OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR MAY BE REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESS THAN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECORDED IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE PURCHASE BY CARDMEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A TRAVELERS

CHEQUE DENOMINATED IN A SECOND CURRENCY; FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS HELD BY AEB AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ITS CLIENT-RELATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING OPERATIONS; AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS, UNLESS PROPERLY

MONITORED AND MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOW WE MANAGE RISK RELATING TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS ON PAGES 44-45 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT

TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2005, WE COMPLETED THE SPIN-OFF OF OUR FINANCIAL

ADVISORS BUSINESS THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTION OF 100% OF THE SHARES OF OUR SUBSIDIARY, AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. (FORMERLY, AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL CORPORATION). WE DISTRIBUTED ONE SHARE OF AMERIPRISE COMMON STOCK FOR EVERY FIVE SHARES OF AMERICAN

EXPRESS COMMON STOCK HELD BY A SHAREHOLDER OUTSTANDING AS OF THE RECORD DATE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION.

WE NO LONGER OWN ANY SHARES OF

AMERIPRISE, AND AMERIPRISE IS AN INDEPENDENT, PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANY. AMERIPRISES COMMON STOCK IS LISTED ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. (NYSE) AND IS TRADED UNDER THE SYMBOL AMP.

NO ACTION WAS REQUIRED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS SHAREHOLDERS TO RECEIVE THEIR AMERIPRISE COMMON STOCK, AND AMERICAN EXPRESS SHAREHOLDERS WERE NOT REQUIRED TO

SURRENDER ANY AMERICAN EXPRESS SHARES OR PAY ANYTHING, OTHER THAN ANY TAXES DUE ON CASH RECEIVED IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARE INTERESTS.

IN

ADDITION, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005, WE COMPLETED CERTAIN DISPOSITIONS (INCLUDING THE SALE OF OUR AMERICAN EXPRESS TAX AND BUSINESS SERVICES, INC. (TBS) SUBSIDIARY TO H&R BLOCK, INC.) FOR CASH PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $190

MILLION.

AMERIPRISES AND TBS RESULTS ARE REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

THIS SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS

BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE

IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR THE

CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE

TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE ON THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT OUR

CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WHO RELY ON HIGH REVOLVING CREDIT

BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY

BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MARKET PRESSURE TO PROVIDE VOLUME DISCOUNTS AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. THIS PRESSURE ARISES, IN PART, DUE TO THE REGULATORY

PRESSURE ON OUR COMPETITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE WE CHARGE MERCHANTS OR ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN PREMIUM DISCOUNT RATES ON OUR CARDS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING OVERALL VOLUME GROWTH OR

AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

INCREASE CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES PRODUCTS OR MANAGE THE COSTS OF OUR CARDMEMBER BENEFITS INTENDED TO STIMULATE SUCH USE.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR TRAVEL

RELATED SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND

INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. IT ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER ATTRITION, INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE, AND CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON OUR NETWORK

BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND

EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES. IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING OR IN MANAGING THE COSTS OF OUR CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, OUR REVENUES AND

PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE

ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION

AMONG EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT

OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES

AND PROFITABILITY.

AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO

OUR BRAND AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES STORE CARDMEMBER

ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. CRIMINALS ARE USING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO

ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT. AS OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION BECOME A MORE ACCEPTABLE WAY OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR

CARDS. IF DATA BREACHES OR FRAUD LEVELS INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE, IT COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE) AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF

OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE

SUCCESSFUL AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE INTENDED.

WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND

ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS (INCLUDING CONTINUING TO REINVEST SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING AND

PROMOTION), ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS,

FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET TO SAVE COSTS

AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF DOWNTURNS IN THESE

INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COSTCO TO OFFER COBRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH

OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY INDUSTRIES, MOST NOTABLY THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS AND IN

RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISK UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA AIR LINES, WHICH WERE RESTRUCTURED IN CONNECTION WITH DELTAS FILING FOR PROTECTION UNDER

CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  AIRLINE INDUSTRY MATTERS ON PAGE 53 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, UNDER SOME TYPES OF

THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN COBRAND PARTNERS, MERCHANTS, VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE

COULD UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS

AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY OR ANY OTHER INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, INCLUDING ANY POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PARTICULAR CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS

GENERALLY) THAT COULD RESULT FROM THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED WEAKNESS OF KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS IN SUCH INDUSTRIES.

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS, MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS AND THE RATE OF

BANKRUPTCIES, WHICH CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS. CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH

CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, PRINCIPALLY FROM CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES, AND OUR OTHER CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK. WHILE CONSUMER CREDIT RISK IS MORE CLOSELY LINKED TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS RATHER THAN BORROWER-SPECIFIC

EVENTS LIKE INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK, BOTH EXPOSE US TO A RISK OF LOSS. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE

COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK. RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN

LOSSES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

ALTHOUGH WE

MAKE ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION THAT WE USE IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE

REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO

FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE MUST

ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD

BUSINESS. CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET FINANCE

CHARGE REVENUE, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL.

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE, INCLUDING THE VALUATION OF THE INTEREST-ONLY STRIP (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE I/O STRIP) ARISING FROM OUR SECURITIZATION OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD

RECEIVABLES.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF

NOT ACHIEVING OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO FAILED PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OR FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS. OPERATIONAL RISKS INCLUDE THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE EXPENSE PROVISION

FOR THE COST OF OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS THE RISK THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE A DOWNTURN IN OUR BUSINESSES AND/OR NEGATIVE CHANGES IN OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER

CONTRACTS, DECREASED LIQUIDITY AND HIGHER BORROWING COSTS.

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND

EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 42-45 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECORD

PROPERLY AND VERIFY A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS, AND THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE.

ADVERSE

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD DECREASE REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

DURING

2005, OVER 30% OF OUR REVENUE WAS GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO

UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS

THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING, INCLUDING SECURITIZATIONS, MAY BE LIMITED.

IN GENERAL, THE AMOUNT, TYPE AND COST OF OUR FUNDING, INCLUDING FINANCING FROM OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS, DIRECTLY IMPACTS OUR

EXPENSE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS AND GROWING OUR ASSETS AND THEREFORE, CAN POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

A

NUMBER OF FACTORS COULD MAKE SUCH FINANCING MORE DIFFICULT, MORE EXPENSIVE OR UNAVAILABLE ON ANY TERMS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY (WHERE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS MAY BE ON TERMS MORE OR LESS FAVORABLE THAN IN THE UNITED STATES), INCLUDING,

BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND LOSSES, CHANGES WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION, SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, CHANGES IN THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, DISRUPTIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT

ADVERSELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, COUNTER-PARTY AVAILABILITY, CHANGES AFFECTING OUR ASSETS, OUR CORPORATE AND REGULATORY STRUCTURE, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, RATINGS AGENCIES ACTIONS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE

LEGAL, REGULATORY, ACCOUNTING AND TAX ENVIRONMENTS GOVERNING OUR FUNDING TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS IS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE GENERAL STATE OF THE U.S. AND WORLD ECONOMIES, AND MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT DUE TO

ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS. ALSO, WE COMPETE FOR FUNDING WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE PUBLICLY TRADED. COMPETITION FROM THESE INSTITUTIONS MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, WE PERIODICALLY SECURITIZE CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS ARISING FROM OUR CARD BUSINESS.

SECURITIZATION INVOLVES THE LEGAL SALE OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOAN BALANCES TO A TRUST, WHICH IN TURN ISSUES SECURITIES TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS COLLATERALIZED BY THE TRANSFERRED RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AND OUR RECEIPT

OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH SECURITIES. ALTHOUGH THE MARKETS FOR SECURITIZED CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS LARGE AND WELL-ESTABLISHED, IF THESE MARKETS EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SECURITIZE OUR

RECEIVABLES OR TO DO SO AT FAVORABLE PRICING LEVELS. IF WE WERE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO SECURITIZE OUR LOAN RECEIVABLES AT DESIRED LEVELS, WE WOULD USE ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS. IF WE WERE UNABLE TO FIND COST-EFFECTIVE

AND STABLE ALTERNATIVES, IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO CERTAIN RISKS. THESE RISKS WOULD INCLUDE AN INCREASE IN OUR COST OF FUNDS, AN INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND THE PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE

CREDIT LOSSES AS MORE LOANS WOULD REMAIN ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, AND LOWER LOAN GROWTH.

IN ADDITION, THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN

EVENTS MAY CAUSE THE SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS TO AMORTIZE EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED, WHICH WOULD ACCELERATE THE NEED FOR AN ALTERNATE SOURCE OF FUNDING.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  FUNDING STRATEGY ON PAGES 35-40 IN THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE

AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO

COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS,

E.G.

, TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS,

MULTI-APPLICATION SMART CARDS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW

SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE NEW SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR CARDS AND NETWORKS. IN ADDITION, OUR

ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE DEVELOP MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS OR BY RESISTANCE FROM CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS TO SUCH CHANGES IN ADDITION TO PATENT RIGHTS HELD BY COMPETITORS OR OTHERS. OUR

FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP OR ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE

MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION OR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE MORE

EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE ARE. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY MAY DECLINE.

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES THROUGH OUR

NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATRIOT ACT, WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENED EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND THE EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THE

PATRIOT ACT REQUIRED US TO CREATE AND IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN

THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED AND WHERE WE PROVIDE PRIVATE AND

CORRESPONDENT BANKING SERVICES, AND THE TYPES OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

THE U.S.

CONGRESS IS ALSO PRESENTLY CONSIDERING REGULATORY INITIATIVES IN THE AREAS OF INTERNET GAMBLING, INTERNET PRESCRIPTION DRUG PURCHASES AND COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT, AMONG OTHERS, THAT COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR

COMPANY. MANY U.S. STATES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF SIMILAR LEGISLATION. IF IMPLEMENTED, THESE INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO MONITOR, FILTER, RESTRICT, OR OTHERWISE OVERSEE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, THEREBY

INCREASING OUR COSTS OR DECREASING OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY, AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY,

IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME

CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED VALUE CARDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR

REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

IN ADDITION, IN 2004, A NUMBER OF REGULATIONS WERE ISSUED IMPLEMENTING THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT

TRANSACTIONS ACT THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAKES PERMANENT THE PREEMPTIVE EFFECT OF SEVERAL KEY PROVISIONS OF THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATORS AND CONGRESS HAVE ALSO INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF OUR PRICING OF CREDIT. ANY LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRICE CREDIT FREELY COULD RESULT IN REDUCED AMOUNTS OF CREDIT AVAILABLE TO OUR CARDMEMBERS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TRANSACTION VOLUME AND REVENUES.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON OUR COMPANY, SUCH AS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR RESULT IN A

REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR NETWORKS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

EXISTING

AND PROPOSED REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF CONSUMER PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY COULD DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ISSUED AND COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY THESE REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIONS INFORMATION SAFEGUARDS RULE UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. THE RULE REQUIRES THAT EACH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEVELOP,

IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN, COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND

THE SENSITIVITY OF ANY CUSTOMER INFORMATION AT ISSUE. IN 2005, THERE WAS A HEIGHTENED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FOCUS ON DATA SECURITY, INCLUDING REQUIRING CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A DATA BREACH. IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE A

NUMBER OF BILLS PENDING IN CONGRESS AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. CONGRESS WILL LIKELY CONSIDER DATA SECURITY/DATA BREACH LEGISLATION IN 2006 THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE ENACTED SECURITY BREACH LEGISLATION, REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY

BREACH, AND SEVERAL OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING SIMILAR LEGISLATION. IN EUROPE, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL HAVE PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE

FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. THE DATA

PROTECTION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS REGULATING DATA PROTECTION IN EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES. REGULATION OF PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY IN THESE AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS FOR ISSUING CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS, WHICH MAY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CARDS WE ISSUE. ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS IN THESE AREAS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR COSTS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. FINALLY, FAILURE TO

COMPLY WITH THE PRIVACY AND DATA USE AND SECURITY LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT COULD RESULT IN FINES, SANCTIONS OR OTHER PENALTIES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OVERALL BUSINESS.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT TRENDS IN CONSUMER SPENDING

AND IN TRAVEL.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS HEAVILY UPON THE OVERALL LEVEL OF SPENDING USING OUR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS, AND WE ARE

NOT INSULATED FROM THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC CYCLES. A SUSTAINED DETERIORATION IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES OR EUROPE, OR INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES IN KEY COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OR AVERAGE PURCHASE AMOUNT OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS AND RESULT IN INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND CREDIT LOSSES. POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES

COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER

CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

TERRORIST ATTACKS, DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST

ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION

OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS MAY DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS.

IF OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE DISRUPTED OR WE ARE UNABLE TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS EFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL, OUR REVENUE OR

PROFITABILITY WOULD BE MATERIALLY REDUCED.

OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE

INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER LOSS, DISRUPTIONS IN LONG DISTANCE OR LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACCESS, FRAUD, TERRORISM OR ACCIDENT. A NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER PROBLEM AT OUR FACILITIES COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES.

ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER FAILS TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER,

OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION, TERRORISM OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF OUR BRANDS RELIABILITY AND MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE IN A 51-STORY, 2.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT

BUILDING LOCATED IN LOWER MANHATTAN. THIS BUILDING, WHICH IS ON LAND LEASED FROM THE BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY FOR A TERM EXPIRING IN 2069, IS ONE OF FOUR OFFICE BUILDINGS IN A COMPLEX KNOWN AS THE WORLD FINANCIAL CENTER. WE HAVE A 49% OWNERSHIP

INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. IN 2002, AN AFFILIATE OF BROOKFIELD FINANCIAL PROPERTIES ACQUIRED THE 51% INTEREST IN THE BUILDING THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN OWNED BY LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. WE ALSO LEASE SPACE IN THE BUILDING FROM BROOKFIELD.

OTHER OWNED OR LEASED PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS INCLUDE: THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE CENTERS IN FORT

LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA; PHOENIX, ARIZONA; GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA; SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH; AND THE AMEX CANADA INC. HEADQUARTERS IN MARKHAM, ONTARIO, CANADA; AND SERVICE CENTERS LOCATED IN MEXICO CITY, MEXICO; SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA; GURGAON, INDIA AND

BRIGHTON, UNITED KINGDOM.

IN DECEMBER 2004, SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL AND LEASE BACK A TOTAL OF SIX

REAL PROPERTIES LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES TO DESIGNATED AFFILIATES OF THE INLAND REAL ESTATE GROUP, INC. (INLAND) AND CLOSED ON THE SALE OF FIVE OF THOSE PROPERTIES. THE FIVE PROPERTIES SOLD IN DECEMBER 2004 WERE THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

SERVICE CENTERS IN FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA; GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA; AND PHOENIX, ARIZONA; THE AMERICAN EXPRESS DATA CENTER IN MINNEAPOLIS; AND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCE CENTER IN PHOENIX. THE REMAINING PROPERTY SUBJECT TO THIS SALE AGREEMENT

WAS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE CENTER IN SALT LAKE CITY AND THE SALE OF THAT FACILITY CLOSED IN MARCH 2005. IN JANUARY 2005, ONE OF OUR CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES CLOSED ON THE SALE AND LEASEBACK OF THE AMEX CANADA HEADQUARTERS PROPERTY REFERRED TO

ABOVE IN MARKHAM, ONTARIO, CANADA. THESE SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS HAVE ENABLED US TO MONETIZE THE VALUE OF THESE PROPERTIES AND USE THE PROCEEDS FOR RE-INVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESSES. ADDITIONALLY, IN JULY 2005, WE COMPLETED A SALE AND

LEASEBACK, WITH AFFILIATES OF WACHOVIA CORPORATION, OF TWO ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES LOCATED IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA.

AT EACH CLOSING OF A

PROPERTY THAT HAS BEEN SOLD AND LEASED BACK, THE PURCHASER OF THE PROPERTY LEASED THE RELEVANT PROPERTY BACK TO ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES FOR A TEN-YEAR TERM, WITH AN OPTION GIVEN TO US TO RENEW THE LEASE FOR UP TO SIX RENEWAL TERMS OF FIVE YEARS

EACH. THE LEASES ARE NET LEASES WHEREBY EACH AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITY THAT LEASES BACK THE PROPERTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, UTILITIES, OPERATING EXPENSES AND INSURANCE COSTS)

IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL RENT. THE SALE LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS WILL NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY YEAR. GAINS RESULTING FROM COMPLETED SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE INITIAL TEN-YEAR LEASE PERIODS. WE

CONTINUE TO CONSIDER WHETHER SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER PROPERTIES THAT WE CURRENTLY OWN.

IN FEBRUARY 2000, WE

ENTERED INTO A TEN-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH TRAMMELL CROW CORPORATE SERVICES, INC. FOR FACILITIES, PROJECT AND TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT AND OTHER RELATED SERVICES. THE AGREEMENT COVERS NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA AND PARTS OF EUROPE AND ASIA.

GENERALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES LEASE THE PREMISES WE OCCUPY IN OTHER LOCATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND

ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO EACH OF THESE ACTIONS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM

VIGOROUSLY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT A PARTY TO, NOR ARE ANY OF ITS PROPERTIES THE SUBJECT OF, ANY PENDING LEGAL OR ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATION OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD AS THE PROCEEDINGS ARE RESOLVED. CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVING THE COMPANY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

CORPORATE MATTERS

BEGINNING IN MID-JULY 2002, 12 PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. IN OCTOBER 2002, THESE CASES WERE CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION

IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED MONETARY DAMAGES AGAINST VISA, MASTERCARD AND EIGHT MAJOR BANKS THAT ARE

MEMBERS OF THE TWO CARD ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE BUSINESS LOST AS A RESULT OF THE ILLEGAL, ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES OF THE CARD ASSOCIATIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY LOCKED THE COMPANY OUT OF THE BANK-ISSUED CARD BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE LAWSUIT

FOLLOWS THE U.S. SUPREME COURTS OCTOBER 2004 DECISION NOT TO HEAR AN APPEAL FROM VISA AND MASTERCARD THAT SOUGHT TO OVERTURN A LOWER COURT RULING THAT FOUND THE TWO CARD ASSOCIATIONS IN VIOLATION OF U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. SINCE FILING THE

THE INCLUSION OF ARBITRATION CLAUSES IN CERTAIN OF THEIR CARDMEMBER AGREEMENTS. THE SUIT SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES. THE CLASS IS DEFINED AS ALL VISA, MASTERCARD AND DINERS CLUB GENERAL PURPOSE CARDHOLDERS WHO USED CARDS

ISSUED BY ANY OF THE MDL DEFENDANT BANKS.... AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDHOLDERS ARE NOT PART OF THE CLASS. IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE COURT DENIED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE ACTION AND PRELIMINARILY CERTIFIED AN INJUNCTION CLASS OF VISA

ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANYS POLICY PROHIBITING MERCHANTS FROM IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS THAT ARE NOT IMPOSED EQUALLY ON OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT VIOLATES U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. THE SUIT SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. TRS

HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT AND THAT MOTION IS PENDING. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS LEARNED THAT TWO ADDITIONAL PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS THAT MAKE ALLEGATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE MADE IN THE PERFORMANCE LABS ACTION HAVE ALSO BEEN FILED.

SUCH ACTIONS SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. AT PRESENT, TRS HAS NOT BEEN SERVED WITH THE COMPLAINTS IN EITHER OF THESE ACTIONS. THE

518 RESTAURANT CORP.

ACTION WAS VOLUNTARILY WITHDRAWN WITHOUT TRS EVER HAVING BEEN SERVED WITH THE COMPLAINT IN

THE CASE. THE COMPLAINT IN THE LEPOWSKI ACTION HAS YET TO BE SERVED ON TRS. ALTHOUGH THE LEPOWSKI ACTION REMAINS PENDING IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, BOTH IT AND THE PERFORMANCE LABS CASE HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN

THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES IN A LARGER MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION INVOLVING OTHER NAMED DEFENDANTS NOT AFFILIATED WITH TRS; HOWEVER, THE CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST TRS ARE LIMITED TO THOSE
