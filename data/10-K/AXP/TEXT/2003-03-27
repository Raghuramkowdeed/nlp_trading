ITEM 1. BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY (INCLUDING ITS SUBSIDIARIES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT

INDICATES OTHERWISE, THE "COMPANY") WAS FOUNDED IN 1850 AS A JOINT STOCK

ASSOCIATION AND WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN

1965. THE COMPANY IS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING TRAVEL

RELATED SERVICES, FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND INTERNATIONAL BANKING SERVICES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.*

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN INVESTOR RELATIONS WEBSITE ON THE INTERNET AT

HTTP://IR.AMERICANEXPRESS.COM. THE COMPANY'S FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("SEC"), INCLUDING ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY

REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K AND ALL AMENDMENTS TO THOSE

REPORTS ARE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE FOLLOWING

THE TIME THEY ARE FILED WITH OR FURNISHED TO THE SEC BY CLICKING ON THE

"SEC FILINGS" LINK FOUND ON THE INVESTOR RELATIONS HOMEPAGE. INTERESTED PERSONS

ARE ALSO ABLE TO ACCESS THE COMPANY'S INVESTOR RELATIONS WEBSITE THROUGH THE

COMPANY'S MAIN WEBSITE AT WWW.AMERICANEXPRESS.COM BY CLICKING ON THE "ABOUT

AMERICAN EXPRESS" LINK, WHICH IS LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE COMPANY'S

HOMEPAGE.

AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTERED 2002 AFTER ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING YEARS IN

ITS RECENT HISTORY. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED SEVERAL IMPORTANT GOALS FOR THE

YEAR: TO DELIVER SOLID EARNINGS, IMPROVE THE UNDERLYING ECONOMICS OF ITS

BUSINESS, CONTINUE TO LOWER CERTAIN RISKS IN THE BUSINESS AND INCREASE ITS

INVESTMENT IN BUSINESS-BUILDING ACTIVITIES. BY THE END OF THE YEAR, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVED THAT IT HAD ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS AGAINST THESE GOALS,

PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF WEAK ECONOMIES AND FINANCIAL MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD.

THE COMPANY'S 2002 FINANCIAL RESULTS REFLECTED SOLID GROWTH IN THE

COMPANY'S CARD BUSINESSES; LOWER EXPENSES DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF ONGOING

REENGINEERING PROGRAMS; STRONG CREDIT QUALITY WITH VERY LOW WRITE-OFF RATES IN

THE COMPANY'S CHARGE CARD PORTFOLIO; AND THE BENEFITS OF LOWER FUNDING COSTS

FROM HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES, WHICH RESULTED IN A BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY

OF MORE THAN $500 MILLION IN INTEREST SAVINGS. FOR A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS, SEE PAGES 26-84 OF THE COMPANY'S 2002 ANNUAL REPORT

TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF REVENUE, SEE PAGES 58-59 OF THE COMPANY'S

2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS. IN 2003, THE COMPANY EXPECTS CONTINUED

UNCERTAINTY IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE

ONGOING WAR IN IRAQ, THE THREAT OF TERRORISM AND OTHER GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY

COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS.

DURING 2002, THE COMPANY UNDERTOOK SEVERAL MEASURES TO CONTINUE TO

STRENGTHEN ITS BUSINESS MODEL SO THAT IT IS MORE FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTABLE AND LESS

RELIANT ON GOOD ECONOMIC CYCLES

----------

* VARIOUS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE MADE IN THIS 10-K ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH

GENERALLY INCLUDE THE WORDS "BELIEVE," "EXPECT," "ANTICIPATE," "OPTIMISTIC,"

"PLAN," "INTEND," "AIM," "WILL," "SHOULD," "COULD," "LIKELY" AND SIMILAR

EXPRESSIONS. CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED ON PAGES 59-64.

PAGE 1

TO DELIVER STRONG RESULTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS REENGINEERING INITIATIVES

AND DELIVERED OVER $1 BILLION IN BENEFITS WHILE ALSO IMPROVING MAJOR BUSINESS

PROCESSES. IT EXPANDED THE USE OF THE INTERNET TO SERVE CUSTOMERS AND CONTINUED

TO DIVERSIFY CARD SPENDING BY LOWERING RELIANCE ON MERCHANTS IN THE TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS. IT CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING ITS BALANCE SHEET

AND IMPROVING ITS RISK PROFILE BY INCREASING RESERVES FOR CARD RECEIVABLES AND

MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES AND CONTINUING TO LOWER ITS CORPORATE LENDING BALANCES

WHILE BUILDING A MORE DIVERSIFIED CONSUMER AND PRIVATE BANKING LOAN

PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY DEVELOPED NEW STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS THAT ENHANCED

CAPABILITIES, AND INVESTED IN BUSINESS-BUILDING ACTIVITIES, WHICH RESULTED IN

THE EXPANSION OF ITS CARD PORTFOLIO IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, AS WELL

AS GROWTH IN ITS GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

IN ADDITION TO THE MEASURES THE COMPANY UNDERTOOK TO STRENGTHEN ITS

BUSINESS, IMPROVE ITS RISK PROFILE AND INVEST IN BUSINESS-BUILDING ACTIVITIES,

THE COMPANY ALSO PLACED RENEWED EMPHASIS ON MANAGING ITS BUSINESS WITH INTEGRITY

AND WITH THE STRONG VALUES THAT HAVE GUIDED IT THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY. THE

COMPANY SUPPORTED THE VARIOUS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REFORMS ADOPTED UNDER THE

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND PROPOSED BY THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. THOUGH

MANY OF THE MEASURES REQUIRED BY THE NEW REGULATIONS WERE ALREADY IN PLACE AT

THE COMPANY, THE ETHICAL FAILURES UNCOVERED AT A NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN LATE

2001 AND 2002 SERVED TO REFOCUS MANAGEMENT ON ENSURING THAT THE COMPANY STRIVES

TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL TARGETS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM INTERESTS RATHER

THAN ON SHORT-TERM, EXPEDIENT SOLUTIONS.

TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES

AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. (INCLUDING ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE, "TRS"), WHICH INCLUDES THE

CARD, TRAVEL, MERCHANT AND NETWORK BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE

AND PREPAID SERVICES GROUP, PROVIDES A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, GLOBAL CARD NETWORK, ISSUING AND PROCESSING

SERVICES, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' CARD, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' REWARDS GREEN

AND AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' REWARDS GOLD CARDS, BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS'R', THE

OPTIMA'R' CARD, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' CASH REBATE CARD, A NUMBER OF CO-BRAND

CARDS, OTHER CONSUMER AND CORPORATE LENDING AND BANKING PRODUCTS, AMERICAN

EXPRESS'R' TRAVELERS CHEQUES, PREPAID CARD PRODUCTS, BUSINESS EXPENSE MANAGEMENT

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, CORPORATE TRAVEL AND TRAVEL MANAGEMENT SERVICES, CONSUMER

TRAVEL SERVICES, TAX, ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS CONSULTING SERVICES, A NETWORK OF

AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES ("ATMS"), MAGAZINE PUBLISHING, MERCHANT TRANSACTION

PROCESSING AND POINT OF SALE AND BACK-OFFICE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, PARTLY OWNED AFFILIATES AND UNAFFILIATED ENTITIES OFFER SOME OF THESE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER LICENSES FROM TRS.

AS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY BELOW, TRS' GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK AND CARD

ISSUING BUSINESS ARE GLOBAL IN SCOPE. TRS HAS THE LARGEST CARD ISSUING BUSINESS

IN THE WORLD BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME. IN 2002, TRS' CHARGE VOLUME WAS $311

BILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY 25% COMING FROM CARDMEMBERS DOMICILED OUTSIDE THE

U.S. CARDS ARE CURRENTLY ISSUED IN 45 CURRENCIES, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY

THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS. CARDS PERMIT CARDMEMBERS TO

CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT

ESTABLISHMENTS THAT HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT THE CARD, AND TO ACCESS CASH THROUGH

ATMS AT MORE THAN 500,000 LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE. IN 2002, TRS ROLLED OUT NUMEROUS

NEW CARD PRODUCTS AND ENTERED INTO VARIOUS CO-BRAND AND OTHER CARD ARRANGEMENTS

IN THE U.S. AND MANY FOREIGN

PAGE 2

COUNTRIES. TRS ADDED A NET TOTAL OF 2.1 MILLION CARDS IN FORCE IN 2002. TOTAL

CARDS IN FORCE REACHED 57.3 MILLION AT THE END OF 2002. THE GLOBAL REACH OF

AMERICAN EXPRESS' BRAND, CARD ISSUING CAPABILITIES AND GENERAL PURPOSE CARD

NETWORK POSITION THE COMPANY WELL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

IN THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS SERVICES BUSINESS, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY.

TRS' BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATION, ALTHOUGH TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES OUTSTANDING

TEND TO BE GREATEST EACH YEAR IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD

QUARTER, AND CARD-BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS.

TRS PLACES SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON ITS TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS AND

DILIGENTLY PROTECTS ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

TRS OPERATES A GLOBAL GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK.

NETWORK FUNCTIONS INCLUDE OPERATIONS, SERVICE DELIVERY, SYSTEMS, AUTHORIZATION,

CLEARING, SETTLEMENT AND BRAND ADVERTISING AND MARKETING; THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS FOR THE NETWORK; AND ESTABLISHING AND ENHANCING

RELATIONSHIPS WITH MILLIONS OF MERCHANTS GLOBALLY, BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE.

ONE OF THE KEY ASSETS OF TRS' NETWORK IS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WHICH

IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST HIGHLY RECOGNIZED AND RESPECTED BRANDS. CARDS BEARING

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS LOGO ("CARDS") ARE ISSUED DIRECTLY BY TRS AND BY LICENSED

QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS, AND ARE ACCEPTED AT ATMS AND AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS

WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. TRS ISSUES THE VAST MAJORITY OF

CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL NETWORK.

IN 2002, TRS CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES ("GNS")

BUSINESS IN WHICH IT AUTHORIZES THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE

AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS THAT ARE ACCEPTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

MERCHANT NETWORK. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS 77 ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE WITH BANKS

AND OTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS IN 77 COUNTRIES PROVIDING FOR CARD ISSUANCE BY

THOSE ENTITIES. WHILE SOME GNS ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR MORE THAN 20

YEARS, THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED SINCE 1995. IN 2002, THE COMPANY

SIGNED EIGHT NEW GNS PARTNERS, INCLUDING TOYOTA FINANCE COMPANY IN JAPAN AND

SAMSUNG CARD COMPANY, LTD. IN KOREA. TOGETHER, GNS PARTNERS LAUNCHED 40 NEW

PRODUCTS DURING 2002. THESE PARTNERSHIPS INCREASE TRS' MARKET PRESENCE, DRIVE

MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO TRS' MERCHANT NETWORK AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD IN SELECTED MARKETS.

TRS MAY CHARGE FEES AND ROYALTIES FOR OTHER SERVICES TO BANKS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CONVERSELY, TRS' PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM ASSOCIATION WITH

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND ACCESS TO TRS' NETWORK SERVICES. GNS CONTINUED TO

SHOW STRONG GROWTH IN BILLED BUSINESS IN 2002.

LOCAL RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING TRS' ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS

AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH SUCH ARRANGEMENTS

EXIST, BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY LICENSED TO

ISSUE CARDS (E.G., VISA AND MASTERCARD CARDS) PRIOR TO THEIR

PAGE 3

ISSUING CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. ACCORDINGLY, TRS' GNS PARTNERS

HAVE GENERALLY NOT HAD DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT

AUTHORIZATION IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH TRS HAS CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO THESE

PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS.

IN MAY 1996, THE COMPANY INVITED BANKS AND OTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS IN

THE UNITED STATES TO BEGIN ISSUING CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. IN

CONTRAST TO THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE NO MAJOR U.S.

BANK ISSUERS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS

SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF RULES AND POLICIES OF VISA USA, INC. AND MASTERCARD

INTERNATIONAL, INCORPORATED ("MASTERCARD") IN THE UNITED STATES CALLING FOR

EXPULSION OF MEMBERS WHO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. NO BANKS HAVE

BEEN WILLING TO FORFEIT MEMBERSHIP IN VISA USA, INC. AND/OR MASTERCARD TO ISSUE

CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN OCTOBER 1998

AGAINST VISA USA, INC. AND VISA INTERNATIONAL CORP. (COLLECTIVELY, "VISA") AND

MASTERCARD, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALLEGED THAT THESE RULES AND POLICIES

VIOLATE THE ANTITRUST LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. IN OCTOBER 2001, THE TRIAL

JUDGE RULED IN FAVOR OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, HOLDING THAT THESE RULES

AND POLICIES DO VIOLATE SUCH LAWS. TRS VIEWS THIS DECISION AS A MAJOR VICTORY

FOR U.S. CONSUMERS BECAUSE IT WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO MORE VIGOROUS COMPETITION

AND MORE INNOVATIVE CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. HOWEVER, VISA AND MASTERCARD

HAVE APPEALED THIS DECISION AND HAVE OBTAINED A STAY OF THE COURT'S JUDGMENT

WHILE THE APPEAL IS PENDING. ASSUMING THE APPEALS COURT AFFIRMS THE TRIAL

COURT'S DECISION, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO LAUNCH THE GNS BUSINESS IN THE U.S.

AFTER THE APPEALS PROCESS HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

AS A NETWORK, TRS ENCOUNTERS INTENSE COMPETITION FROM OTHER CARD NETWORKS.

GLOBAL COMPETITION COMES FROM VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB, DISCOVER FINANCIAL

SERVICES, A BUSINESS UNIT OF MORGAN STANLEY & CO. (U.S. ONLY), AND JCB CO., LTD.

(PRIMARILY IN JAPAN). THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK

BUSINESS ARE (I) THE NUMBER OF CARDS IN FORCE AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THESE

CARDS; (II) THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT THE CARDS;

(III) THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS OF

PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK; (IV) THE SUCCESS OF TARGETED MARKETING AND

PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; (V) REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION; (VI) THE ABILITY TO

DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES COST EFFECTIVELY ON A

GLOBAL BASIS; (VII) THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE TYPES OF

CARD PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS, ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS ON THE

NETWORK; (VIII) SUCCESS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGIES TO REDUCE SUPPRESSION --

WHEN MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS ENCOURAGE A CUSTOMER TO USE ANOTHER CARD OR

CASH; (IX) THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT SYSTEMS; AND (X) THE QUALITY

OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES

DURING 2002, TRS CONTINUED ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO

USE THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD AS THEIR CARD OF CHOICE FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING AT

ESTABLISHMENTS SUCH AS SUPERMARKETS, GAS STATIONS, DRUG STORES AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT STORES, AS WELL AS FOR THEIR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING. TRS

ALSO CONTINUED TO INCREASE THE RANGE OF MERCHANTS IN RETAIL AND EVERYDAY

SPENDING CATEGORIES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD. KEY SIGNINGS IN THE UNITED STATES

INCLUDED THE STOP & SHOP SUPERMARKET COMPANY, DAIRY QUEEN, TIME WARNER CABLE AND

H&R; BLOCK. AS OF THE END OF 2002, TRS ESTIMATES THAT THE MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE

UNITED STATES ACCOMMODATED

PAGE 4

MORE THAN 95 PERCENT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS' GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARD SPENDING.

AS A RESULT OF THE EXPANSION OF THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS AND THE UTILIZATION OF A MORE DISCRIMINATING APPROACH TO IDENTIFY

AND CANCEL INACTIVE MERCHANT ACCOUNTS, IN 2002, TRS CONTINUED TO REFINE ITS

CALCULATION OF INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT COVERAGE. BASED ON THIS REFINEMENT, AS OF

THE END OF 2002, IN MARKETS IN WHICH TRS IS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, TRS'

INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT COVERAGE ACCOMMODATED APPROXIMATELY 84 PERCENT OF

CARDMEMBERS' GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING, UP FROM

APPROXIMATELY 83 PERCENT A YEAR AGO. TRS CONTINUED TO MAKE STRONG PROGRESS

GLOBALLY IN SIGNING KEY MERCHANTS AND MERCHANTS IN NEW INDUSTRY CATEGORIES,

INCLUDING QUICK-SERVICE RESTAURANTS, GOVERNMENT, UTILITIES AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS. NEW SIGNINGS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS INCLUDED MAYNE GROUP

LIMITED-PHARMACY SERVICES IN AUSTRALIA; CANADIAN TIRE; CORA HYPERMARKETS IN

FRANCE; ARKIO IN MEXICO; AND NTT DOCOMO, A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER IN JAPAN.

ALONG WITH EXPANDING MERCHANT COVERAGE, TRS ALSO LAUNCHED NEW CARD PRODUCTS AND

PROMOTIONS TO BUILD SPENDING IN RETAIL AND EVERYDAY LOCATIONS.

DURING 2002, TRS COMPLETED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS VARIOUS AGREEMENTS

WITH JCB CO., LTD., THE LARGEST CARD ISSUER AND MERCHANT ACQUIRER IN JAPAN,

WHEREBY TRS BECAME THE THIRD-PARTY MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR JCB CARD TRANSACTIONS

IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA, INDIA, MEXICO, AND NEW ZEALAND. AS A RESULT OF THESE

AGREEMENTS, OVER 150,000 TRS SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES BEGAN

ACCEPTING THE JCB CARD. DURING 2002, TRS ALSO COMPLETED THE SECOND PHASE OF

IMPLEMENTING THE AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH JCB BECAME THE THIRD-PARTY MERCHANT

ACQUIRER FOR TRS IN JAPAN. AS A RESULT OF THIS IMPLEMENTATION, OVER 500,000

ADDITIONAL MERCHANTS IN JAPAN BEGAN ACCEPTING THE CARD, SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING

THE EXTENT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT COVERAGE IN THE COUNTRY.

TRS' OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE MERCHANT COVERAGE WHEREVER AND HOWEVER

CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD. TRS SIGNS UP NEW MERCHANTS THROUGH A NUMBER OF

SALES CHANNELS: A PROPRIETARY SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY SALES AGENTS, THE

INTERNET, TELEMARKETING AND INBOUND "WANT TO HONOR" CALLS (I.E., MERCHANTS

DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD CONTACTING THE COMPANY DIRECTLY).

TRS EARNS "DISCOUNT REVENUE" FROM FEES CHARGED TO "SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS"

FOR ACCEPTING CARDS WHERE TRS IS THE "MERCHANT ACQUIRER." THE DISCOUNT, WHICH IS

THE FEE CHARGED BY THE COMPANY TO THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT FOR ACCEPTING CARDS,

IS DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT THAT TRS PAYS TO A SERVICE

ESTABLISHMENT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT IS DEFINED AS A

MERCHANT THAT ENTERS INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACCEPT CARDS AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT

FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS THE ENTITY THAT MAINTAINS THE

MERCHANT CARD ACCEPTANCE RELATIONSHIP, RECEIVES ALL CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE

MERCHANT AND PAYS THE MERCHANT FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS. WHEN A CARDMEMBER

PRESENTS THE CARD FOR PAYMENT, THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT CREATES A RECORD OF

CHARGE FOR THE TRANSACTION AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT.

THE DISCOUNT (I.E., VALUE OF CHARGE TIMES DISCOUNT RATE) IS DEDUCTED FROM

PAYMENT TO THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT AND IS RECORDED AS DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE

TIME THE TRANSACTION IS CAPTURED. WHERE TRS ACTS AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND

THE CARD PRESENTED AT A SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT IS ISSUED BY A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF TRS' GNS PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS,

TRS WILL MAKE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE CARD ISSUER. SUCH AMOUNTS SHARED ARE

RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF DISCOUNT REVENUE. WHERE THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A

THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TRS ALSO RECEIVES A PORTION OF THE

DISCOUNT REVENUE CHARGED TO SUCH SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS. SUCH AMOUNTS SHARED

WITH AND PAID TO TRS ARE RECORDED AS DISCOUNT REVENUE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE, WHICH IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE

AMOUNT CHARGED ON A CARD, IS CONTRACTUALLY AGREED WITH THE SERVICE

ESTABLISHMENT. THE LEVEL OF THE DISCOUNT RATE CHARGED IS PRINCIPALLY DETERMINED

BY THE VALUE THAT IS DELIVERED TO THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT AND GENERALLY

INCLUDES A PREMIUM TO OTHER CARDS. VALUE IS DELIVERED TO THE SERVICE

ESTABLISHMENT THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS, THE VOLUME OF SPENDING BY ALL

CARDMEMBERS AND THE

PAGE 5

INSISTENCE OF CARDMEMBERS TO USE THEIR CARDS WHEN ENROLLED IN LOYALTY OR OTHER

CARD USAGE PROGRAMS.

THE DISCOUNT RATE VARIES WITH THE TYPE OF PARTICIPATING ESTABLISHMENT, THE

CHARGE VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT TO THE ESTABLISHMENT, THE METHOD

OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE AVERAGE CHARGE AMOUNT

AND THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION PROVIDED. TRS HAS GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE

HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES TO PARTICIPATING ESTABLISHMENTS THAN ITS COMPETITORS AS A

RESULT OF TRS' ATTRACTIVE CARDMEMBER BASE. WHILE MANY ESTABLISHMENTS UNDERSTAND

THIS PRICING IN RELATION TO THE VALUE PROVIDED, TRS HAS ENCOUNTERED

DISSATISFACTION FROM SOME ESTABLISHMENTS, AS WELL AS SUPPRESSION OF THE CARD'S

USE. TRS CONTINUES TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE, AND

HAS MADE PROGRESS BY CONCENTRATING ON ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT

TO USE THE CARD, PROVIDING BETTER AND EARLIER COMMUNICATION OF THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS VALUE PROPOSITION AND, WHEN NECESSARY, BY CANCELING MERCHANTS WHO

SUPPRESS USAGE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. OVER TIME, THE COMPANY HAS

EXPERIENCED SOME EROSION IN ITS DISCOUNT RATE, PRIMARILY REFLECTING ITS

BUSINESS DECISION TO EXPAND ITS MERCHANT COVERAGE BASE TO LOWER RATE "EVERYDAY

SPEND" MERCHANT CATEGORIES, AND THE STRONGER THAN AVERAGE GROWTH RATES IN THOSE

CATEGORIES.

TRS FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING KEY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE

MERCHANT SATISFACTION, ON EXECUTING PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT

MERCHANTS AND ON STRENGTHENING ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS THROUGH AN

EXPANDED ROSTER OF SERVICES THAT HELP THEM MEET THEIR BUSINESS GOALS. IN 2002,

TRS CONTINUED TO OFFER VALUE ADDED FRONT-OFFICE SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT

MERCHANTS' BILLING NEEDS. THESE FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS INCLUDE THE PURCHASE EXPRESS

PRODUCT THAT ENABLES MERCHANTS TO AUTHORIZE AND SETTLE TRANSACTIONS FROM THEIR

PCS AND CAPTURE ADDITIONAL DATA REQUIRED FOR CORPORATE PURCHASING CARD

TRANSACTIONS. TRS ALSO CONTINUES TO SUPPORT MERCHANT IMPLEMENTATIONS ON THE

AUTOMATED BILL PAYMENT PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS MERCHANTS TO BILL CARDMEMBERS ON A

REGULAR BASIS FOR REPEATED CHARGES SUCH AS INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS.

WHEREVER TRS MANAGES BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS AND

THE CARD-ISSUING SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A "CLOSED LOOP," WHICH

DISTINGUISHES THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK FROM THE BANK CARD NETWORKS IN THAT

THERE IS ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD TRANSACTION. THIS

ENABLES TRS TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MERCHANTS AND

SPECIAL OFFERS TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS.

DURING 2002, TRS CONTINUED TO ADDRESS CREDIT QUALITY ISSUES ON THE MERCHANT

SIDE OF ITS BUSINESS AND THE GROWING RISK RELATED TO MERCHANT BANKRUPTCIES IN

LIGHT OF THE DIFFICULT ECONOMY. TO REDUCE THIS RISK, PARTICULARLY IN THE TRAVEL

INDUSTRY WHERE MERCHANTS MAY BE PAID BY THE COMPANY WELL BEFORE THE TIME THEY

ACTUALLY RENDER THE SERVICES TO CARDMEMBERS, THE COMPANY HOLDS PAYMENTS TO

SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE APPROPRIATE. IN SOME CASES, THE COMPANY HAS

LENGTHENED THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE CARD CHARGES ARE SUBMITTED BY THE MERCHANT

AND WHEN THE COMPANY PAYS THE MERCHANT AND HAS TAKEN OTHER APPROPRIATE STEPS TO

MANAGE RISK.

AT YEAR-END 2002, TRS WAS THE SIXTH-LARGEST OWNER/OPERATOR OF ATMS IN THE

UNITED STATES WITH MORE THAN 7,300 TERMINALS, WHICH ARE OPERATED UNDER THE ATM

AXIS'R' BRAND.

PAGE 6

IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST ON THE PART OF A

NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD IN THE FEES THAT MERCHANTS ARE

CHARGED TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, REGULATORS IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, EUROPEAN UNION AND AUSTRALIA HAVE CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS

INTO THE WAY THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD MEMBERS COLLECTIVELY SET THE

"INTERCHANGE," WHICH IS THE FEE PAID TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK AND THE

FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF MERCHANT PRICING, AND ARE IMPOSING REGULATIONS ON THIS

PROCESS. REGULATORS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED THE INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF PROHIBITING

MERCHANTS FROM PASSING THESE FEES ALONG TO CONSUMERS THROUGH SURCHARGES ON

CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORY FOCUS HAS FOR THE MOST PART BEEN

SPECIFICALLY ON VISA AND MASTERCARD, GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE CARD

ASSOCIATIONS' PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL CARD SERVICE PROVIDERS BY

INCREASING PRESSURE ON THE LEVELS OF INTERCHANGE AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT. DOWNWARD

MOVEMENT OF INTERCHANGE AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT MAY IMPACT THE RELATIVE ECONOMIC

ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS OF PARTICIPATING IN A

PARTICULAR NETWORK, AND MAY DRIVE CARD SERVICE PROVIDERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER

SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS ANNUAL CARD FEES. IN ADDITION, ANY LEGAL OR

REGULATORY BAR ON THE "NO SURCHARGING" RULES MAY RESULT IN MERCHANT SURCHARGING

TO CONSUMERS WHO CHOOSE TO PAY WITH CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS. AS A RESULT OF

ACTION TAKEN BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA, MERCHANTS IN AUSTRALIA ARE

PERMITTED TO SURCHARGE CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD

TRANSACTIONS, AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003.

CONSUMER CARD, SMALL BUSINESS AND CONSUMER TRAVEL SERVICES

AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, TRS' CARD BUSINESS HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE BOTH IN

THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY. TRS AND ITS LICENSEES OFFER INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS

CHARGE CARDS SUCH AS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' CARD, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' GOLD

CARD, THE PLATINUM CARD'R', AND THE ULTRA-PREMIUM CENTURION'R' CARD; REVOLVING

CREDIT CARDS SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS'R', THE OPTIMA'R' CARD AND THE

RECENTLY LAUNCHED AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' CASH REBATE CARD, AMONG OTHERS; AND A

VARIETY OF CARDS SPONSORED BY AND CO-BRANDED WITH OTHER CORPORATIONS AND

INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE DELTA SKYMILES'R' CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS,

AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' PLATINUM CASH REBATE CARD EXCLUSIVELY FOR COSTCO MEMBERS AND

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' COSTCO BUSINESS CARD FROM OPEN: THE SMALL BUSINESS

NETWORK.

CHARGE CARDS, WHICH ARE MARKETED IN THE U.S. AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND

CARRY NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT

AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES. CHARGES ARE

APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A CARDMEMBER'S ACCOUNT HISTORY,

CREDIT RECORD AND PERSONAL RESOURCES. CHARGE CARDS GENERALLY REQUIRE PAYMENT BY

THE CARDMEMBER OF THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH, AND NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE

ASSESSED. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO

A DELINQUENCY ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE CANCELED.

TRS AND ITS LICENSEES ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE CARDS HAVE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT PAYMENT

TERMS, GRACE PERIODS AND RATE AND FEE STRUCTURES. SINCE LATE 1994, WHEN THE

COMPANY BEGAN AGGRESSIVELY TO EXPAND ITS CREDIT CARD BUSINESS, ITS LENDING

BALANCE GROWTH HAS BEEN AMONG THE TOP TIER OF CARD ISSUERS. MUCH OF THIS GROWTH

HAS BEEN DUE TO THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANY'S LENDING PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM

PAGE 7

AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THE DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, AS

WELL AS THE INCREASED NUMBER OF CHARGE CARDMEMBERS WHO HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

THE COMPANY'S "LENDING ON CHARGE" OPTIONS (SUCH AS SIGN & TRAVEL). TRS CONTINUED

TO BOLSTER ITS PROPRIETARY BUSINESS THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF MORE THAN 100

NEW PROPRIETARY CARD PRODUCTS IN 17 COUNTRIES DURING 2002. THESE ARE CARDS THAT

AMERICAN EXPRESS ISSUES, EITHER ON ITS OWN OR CO-BRANDED WITH PARTNERING

INSTITUTIONS.

THE WIDE ARRAY OF NEW OR ENHANCED INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTS INCLUDED BLUE

FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS IN MEXICO AND INDONESIA (BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

INTERNATIONAL "BLUE" MARKETS TO 18), THE AMERICAN EXPRESS TIGER WOODS CREDIT

CARD IN CANADA, AND CO-BRANDED CARDS WITH SUCH HIGH-VALUE PARTNERS AS COSTCO

IN PUERTO RICO, ALITALIA IN ITALY AND SHINSEI BANK IN JAPAN. TRS ALSO ACQUIRED

A CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO FROM AMP BANK, ONE OF AUSTRALIA'S LEADING FINANCIAL

SERVICES COMPANIES.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK ("CENTURION BANK"), A WHOLLY OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF TRS, ISSUES BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE OPTIMA CARD, AND ALL

OTHER AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES AND

OWNS MOST OF THE RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THESE CARDS. IN ADDITION,

CENTURION BANK HAS OUTSTANDING LINES OF CREDIT IN ASSOCIATION WITH CERTAIN

CHARGE CARDS AND OFFERS UNSECURED LOANS TO CARDMEMBERS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS

SIGN & TRAVEL AND EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION PROGRAMS. THE SIGN & TRAVEL'R' PROGRAM

GIVES QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDED PAYMENTS FOR AIRLINE,

CRUISE AND CERTAIN TRAVEL CHARGES THAT ARE PURCHASED WITH THE CHARGE CARD. THE

EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION OFFERS QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF

EXTENDING PAYMENT FOR CERTAIN CHARGES ON THE CHARGE CARD IN EXCESS OF A

SPECIFIED AMOUNT. CENTURION BANK IS ALSO THE ISSUER OF CERTAIN CHARGE CARDS IN

THE U.S. VARIOUS FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS ARE OFFERED TO CARDMEMBERS IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AS WELL.

TRS ISSUES CARDS UNDER CO-BRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS

AND AFFINITY PROGRAMS WITH CERTAIN MARKETING PARTNERS. EXAMPLES OF TRS'

CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE AGREEMENTS WITH AERO MEXICO, AIR FRANCE, LOYALTY

MANAGEMENT GROUP CANADA, INC. (AIR MILES), ALITALIA, BRITISH AIRWAYS, COSTCO,

DELTA AIRLINES, HILTON HOTELS, MADISON SQUARE GARDEN (NEW YORK KNICKS/NEW YORK

RANGERS), SHOP RITE SUPERMARKETS, SINGAPORE AIRLINES, SOGO - UNY (HONG KONG),

AND STARWOOD HOTELS & RESORTS. THE LENGTHS OF ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGE

FROM 5 TO 10 YEARS. CARDMEMBERS EARN REWARDS PROVIDED BY THE COMMERCIAL FIRMS'

RESPECTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR SPENDING ON THE CO-BRAND CARDS,

SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY POINTS AND REBATES. TRS MAKES

PAYMENTS TO THE COMMERCIAL FIRMS WITH WHICH IT HAS CO-BRAND CARD ARRANGEMENTS.

PAYMENTS BY TRS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND

CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING, AND, UNDER CERTAIN

ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. TRS EXPENSES

AMOUNTS DUE UNDER CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MONTH EARNED. PAYMENT TERMS

VARY BY ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. ONCE TRS MAKES PAYMENT TO

THE CO-BRAND PARTNER, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PARTNER IS SOLELY LIABLE WITH

RESPECT TO PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE CO-BRAND PARTNER'S

OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM.

AFFINITY PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNED AS JOINT MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS

WHEREBY TRS AND THE AFFINITY PARTNER CREATE A PROGRAM WITH JOINT BRANDING AND

OFFERS DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE WITH A RELATIONSHIP OR AFFINITY TO A

PARTICULAR PARTNER-ENTITY OR ASSOCIATION. IN GENERAL, IN AN AFFINITY

ARRANGEMENT, TRS MAKES PAYMENTS TO THE AFFINITY PARTNERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY

BASED ON

PAGE 8

THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED THROUGH THE AFFINITY ARRANGEMENT

AND THE AMOUNT OF ANNUAL CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON SUCH CARDS. THE LENGTHS OF SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGE FROM 5 TO 7 YEARS.

THE COMPANY ALSO ISSUES CARDS UNDER ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS, PRIMARILY

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SUCH BANK DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS INVOLVE THE

OFFERING OF A STANDARD COMPANY PRODUCT (ISSUED BY TRS OR ONE OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES) TO CUSTOMERS OF THE BANK, GENERALLY WITH THE BANK'S LOGO ON THE

CARD. IN A BANK DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANY MAKES PAYMENTS TO THE BANK

PARTNERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND

RETAINED THROUGH THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON SUCH

CARDS. THE LENGTH OF SUCH ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGE FROM 5 TO 7 YEARS. NEW

DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS DURING 2002 WERE SIGNED WITH SOCIETE GENERALE IN

FRANCE, BAN REGIO IN MEXICO, ERSTE BANK IN AUSTRIA AND JOSEPH LEOPOLD BANK IN

THE UK.

IN ADDITION TO THE PAYMENTS TO CO-BRAND, AFFINITY AND BANK PARTNERS

REFERRED TO ABOVE, THE ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH ENTITIES MAY CONTAIN OTHER TERMS

UNIQUE TO THE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE PARTNER, INCLUDING AN OBLIGATION ON THE PART

OF TRS TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

MANY TRS CARDMEMBERS, PARTICULARLY CHARGE CARD HOLDERS, ARE CHARGED AN

ANNUAL FEE WHICH VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD, THE NUMBER OF CARDS FOR EACH

ACCOUNT, THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THE CARD IS DENOMINATED AND THE COUNTRY OF

RESIDENCE OF THE CARDMEMBER. MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS ARE OFFERED WITH NO

ANNUAL FEE. EACH CARDMEMBER MUST MEET STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR

CREDITWORTHINESS THAT ARE APPLIED THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS BOTH AT THE TIME OF

INITIAL SOLICITATION OR APPLICATION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING THE CARD

RELATIONSHIP. THE COMPANY USES SOPHISTICATED CREDIT MODELS AND TECHNIQUES IN ITS

RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS.

SEVERAL PRODUCTS LAUNCHED OR RENEWED BY TRS IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE

LAST FEW YEARS CONTINUED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS RESULTS IN

2002. IN ONE MAJOR MOVE, TRS ENHANCED ITS CLASSIC CHARGE CARD LINEUP BY

INTRODUCING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS REWARDS GREEN AND AMERICAN EXPRESS REWARDS GOLD

CARDS FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THESE CARDS OFFER AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT IN THE

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS'R' PROGRAM AND DOUBLE POINTS FOR EVERYDAY PURCHASES AT

SUPERMARKETS, GAS STATIONS, DRUGSTORES, HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES AND OTHER

LOCATIONS. REWARDS-BASED PRODUCTS NOT ONLY DRIVE HIGHER SPENDING, THEY ALSO HAVE

VERY FAVORABLE ECONOMICS IN TERMS OF CARDMEMBER ATTRITION, CREDIT AND PAYMENT

PERFORMANCE. FOLLOWING THEIR LAUNCH, THE NEW AMERICAN EXPRESS REWARDS GREEN AND

AMERICAN EXPRESS REWARDS GOLD CHARGE CARDS AND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CASH

REBATE CARD HAD GOOD EARLY PERFORMANCE, TOGETHER ATTRACTING ALMOST 500,000 NEW

CARDS IN 2002, WITH MOST COMING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION TO IMPROVING

TRS' U.S. CONSUMER CHARGE CARD OFFERINGS, THESE NEW CARDS PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS

WITH ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES TO EARN REWARDS AND SUPPORT TRS' EFFORTS TO DRIVE

SPENDING AT EVERYDAY LOCATIONS. TRS ALSO LAUNCHED THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CASH

REBATE CARD FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THIS CARD CARRIES NO ANNUAL FEE AND OFFERS UP TO

FIVE PERCENT CASH BACK, BASED ON A CARDMEMBER'S ANNUAL SPENDING AND PAYMENT

ACTIVITY.

IN ADDITION TO THESE NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES, TRS CONTINUED TO GROW ITS

EXISTING REWARDS-BASED LENDING PRODUCTS IN THE U.S., SUCH AS ITS

CO-BRAND PORTFOLIOS WITH DELTA AIR LINES AND COSTCO.

TRS ALSO FOCUSED ON EXPANDING ITS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM -- THE LARGEST

PROGRAM OF ITS KIND, WITH MORE THAN NINE MILLION CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED WORLDWIDE.

TRS CONTINUED TO EXPAND THE ARRAY OF CHOICES IN MEMBERSHIP REWARDS IN 2002,

SIGNING NEW PARTNERS IN RETAIL AND

PAGE 9

ENTERTAINMENT CATEGORIES INCLUDING BANANA REPUBLIC, BLOCKBUSTER, BROADWAY.COM,

CINGULAR WIRELESS, STAPLES, TICKETMASTER, THE HOME DEPOT AND TOYS "R" US. ABOUT

1,200 REDEMPTION PARTNERS NOW PARTICIPATE IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM.

TRS' MEMBERSHIP REWARDS LOYALTY PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE A STRONG DRIVER OF

CARDMEMBER RETENTION AND PROFITABILITY.

TRS MAKES PAYMENTS TO MERCHANTS PURSUANT TO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WHEN

CARDMEMBERS REDEEM THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS AND ESTABLISHES RESERVES IN

CONNECTION WITH ESTIMATED FUTURE REDEMPTIONS. DUE TO HIGHER CHARGE VOLUMES AND

OVERALL REWARD REDEMPTION COSTS, THE EXPENSE OF MEMBERSHIP REWARDS HAS INCREASED

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND CONTINUES TO GROW. DURING 2002, TRS WORKED TO

REDUCE PROGRAM-RELATED COSTS. CARDMEMBERS CAN NOW HANDLE ONLINE MANY

PROGRAM-RELATED ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS ENROLLMENT AND POINT REDEMPTION. BY OFFERING

A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES, TRS HAS IMPROVED CUSTOMER SATISFACTION OF

THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM AND LOWERED THE AVERAGE COST PER POINT THAT IS

REDEEMED. TRS WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK WAYS TO CONTAIN THE OVERALL COST OF THE

PROGRAM AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS.

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM IS A POWERFUL

DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER LOYALTY IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER BUSINESS. TRS NOW

OFFERS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS IN 30 COUNTRIES. IN 2002, TRS ENHANCED ITS REWARDS

PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL MARKETS, OFFERING RICHER AND MORE FLEXIBLE CHOICES THAT

ENABLE CARDMEMBERS TO EARN POINTS MORE QUICKLY. IN ADDITION TO USING THE

INTERNET TO SUPPORT MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, TRS CONTINUED TO DELIVER OTHER ONLINE

TOOLS TO HELP ITS CUSTOMERS EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE

COMPANY.

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, CARDMEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF FREE AND

FEE-BASED SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CARD THEY HAVE

AND THEIR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE. THESE INCLUDE THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM,

GLOBAL ASSIST'R' HOTLINE, BUYER'S ASSURANCE PLAN, CAR RENTAL LOSS AND DAMAGE

INSURANCE, TRAVEL ACCIDENT INSURANCE, PURCHASE PROTECTION PLAN, BEST VALUE

GUARANTEE, EMERGENCY CARD REPLACEMENT, EMERGENCY CHECK CASHING PRIVILEGES,

AUTOMATIC FLIGHT INSURANCE, PREMIUM BAGGAGE PROTECTION, PRIVATE PAYMENTS'R',

ASSURED RESERVATIONS AND ONLINE FRAUD PROTECTION GUARANTEE. CERTAIN CARDS

PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS WITH ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL SERVICES, SUCH AS A YEAR-END

SUMMARY OF CHARGES REPORT. THE PLATINUM CARD, OFFERED TO CERTAIN CARDMEMBERS IN

THE UNITED STATES AND IN VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH TRS ISSUES

CARDS, PROVIDES ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL AND ENHANCED TRAVEL, FINANCIAL, INSURANCE,

PERSONAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER SERVICES. THE CENTURION CARD, WHICH IS OFFERED IN

THE U.S. AND SIX OTHER COUNTRIES, IS AN ULTRA-PREMIUM CHARGE CARD PROVIDING

HIGHLY PERSONALIZED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AN ARRAY OF TRAVEL, LIFESTYLE AND

FINANCIAL BENEFITS. PERSONAL, GOLD, PLATINUM CARD AND CENTURION CARDMEMBERS

RECEIVE THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP STATEMENT, WHICH IS USED TO COMMUNICATE

SPECIAL OFFERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF BOTH MERCHANTS AND THE COMPANY. IT

IS NOW OFFERED IN THE U.S. AS WELL AS IN SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

EXAMPLES OF ADDITIONAL SERVICES OFFERED FOR A FEE TO CARDMEMBERS INCLUDE

TRAVEL, ACCIDENT AND CREDIT INSURANCE PRODUCTS, A CARD REGISTRY AND REPLACEMENT

SERVICE, CREDIT BUREAU MONITORING AND TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES. ADDITIONAL

SERVICES INCLUDE A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE FOR MAGAZINES, A PRE-PAID LEGAL SERVICE

AND VARIOUS MERCHANDISE-RELATED OFFERINGS.

PAGE 10

OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, TRS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE ROSTER OF

MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT TRS' CARD PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES THAT

ACCEPT THE CARD. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN RECENT YEARS, TRS HAS FOCUSED ITS

EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE USE OF ITS CARDS FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING AT SUCH PLACES

AS SUPERMARKETS, GAS STATIONS AND RETAILERS, AS WELL AS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS

SERVICES. CONSUMERS INCREASINGLY WANT TO USE CARDS FOR EVERYDAY PURCHASES AND

TEND TO MAINTAIN THEIR LEVEL OF SPENDING IN THESE AREAS, IN CONTRAST TO SPENDING

FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT, EVEN DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC

WEAKNESS. IN 1990, 65 PERCENT OF ALL OF TRS' U.S. BILLINGS CAME FROM THE TRAVEL

AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 35 PERCENT CAME FROM RETAIL AND OTHER SECTORS. BY

2002, THAT PROPORTION WAS ESSENTIALLY REVERSED, WITH EVERYDAY SPENDING

ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 60 PERCENT OF THE BUSINESS BILLED ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

THIS SHIFT RESULTED FROM THE GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS WHO

BEGAN TO ACCEPT CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' INCREASED

DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR MORE OF THEIR PURCHASES, AND TRS' FOCUS ON

EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO EXPLOIT THESE OPPORTUNITIES. IN 2002, THIS SHIFT

WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF A DECREASE IN SPENDING IN TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT

RESULTING FROM THE OVERALL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.

AS PART OF THE COMPANY-WIDE EFFORT IN 2002 TO FURTHER REDUCE CERTAIN RISKS

TO ITS BALANCE SHEET, TRS CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN STRONG RESERVE COVERAGE TO

ADDRESS CREDIT QUALITY IN ITS CHARGE CARD AND LENDING PORTFOLIO. IN THIS REGARD

TRS INCREASED ITS RESERVE COVERAGE OF PAST DUE BALANCES, WHICH REMAINED IN

EXCESS OF 100 PERCENT.

TRS IS CONCERNED ABOUT FRAUD THROUGHOUT ITS CARD OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO TAKE MEASURES TO ADDRESS FRAUD ISSUES, INCLUDING INVESTING IN NEW

TECHNOLOGIES AND EDUCATING CARDMEMBERS THROUGH FRAUD PROTECTION INITIATIVES. THE

COMPANY HAD SUCCESS IN REDUCING KNOWN FRAUD IN 2002.

TRS CONTINUES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND

INTERNATIONALLY, IN ITS CARD PROCESSING SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW

FASTER INTRODUCTION AND GREATER CUSTOMIZATION OF PRODUCTS. TRS ALSO IS USING

TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE ITS SERVICE CAPABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, TRS

MAINTAINS A SERVICE DELIVERY PLATFORM THAT ITS EMPLOYEES USE IN THE CARD

BUSINESS TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER SERVICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE, UPDATING OF CARDMEMBER INFORMATION, THE

ADDITION OF NEW CARDS TO AN ACCOUNT AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ISSUES. IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, TRS IS BUILDING FLEXIBILITY AND ENHANCING ITS GLOBAL

PLATFORMS AND CAPABILITIES IN REVOLVING CREDIT, ITS FULL SERVICE BANKING

PLATFORM AND CONSUMER PAYMENT OPTIONS. SEE "CORPORATE AND OTHER" FOR A

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY'S ARRANGEMENT TO OUTSOURCE MANY OF ITS TECHNOLOGY

OPERATIONS TO IBM.

TRS IS ALSO A LEADING PROVIDER OF FINANCIAL AND TRAVEL SERVICES TO SMALL

BUSINESSES (I.E., GENERALLY LESS THAN 100 EMPLOYEES AND/OR SALES OF $10 MILLION

OR LESS), A KEY GROWTH AREA IN THE UNITED STATES. IN 2002, TRS TOOK STEPS TO

STRENGTHEN ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THIS CUSTOMER SEGMENT BY INTRODUCING A

NEW SET OF PRODUCTS, SERVICES, CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS, AS WELL

AS INCREASING THE USE OF THE INTERNET TO MEET THE SERVICING NEEDS OF SMALL

BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE UNITED STATES. AS PART OF THIS INITIATIVE, TRS' SMALL

BUSINESS SERVICES GROUP CREATED A NEW SUB-BRAND AND ADOPTED A NEW NAME, OPEN.

THE SMALL BUSINESS NETWORK FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS'SM' ("OSBN"). THIS NETWORK

PROVIDES A ROBUST NEW SET OF PRODUCTS, SERVICES, ONLINE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT TOOLS

AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT OFFER EVERYDAY SAVINGS TO SMALL

PAGE 11

BUSINESSES. A NATIONWIDE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN SUPPORTED THIS EFFORT, REINFORCING

AMERICAN EXPRESS' COMMITMENT TO SERVING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS.

NEW CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN 2002 INCLUDED THE

BUSINESS PURCHASE ACCOUNT'R' (CHARGE), THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT'R'

(CREDIT), AND THE PLATINUM DELTA SKYMILES BUSINESS CREDIT CARD. TRS ALSO ADDED

SEVERAL NEW MERCHANTS TO THE EVERYDAY SAVINGS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESS

CARDMEMBERS, INCLUDING CINGULAR WIRELESS, KINKO'S, NEXTEL AND STAPLES.

TRS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WITH

RESPECT TO THE CARD ISSUING BUSINESS. AS A CARD ISSUER, TRS COMPETES IN THE U.S.

WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIBANK, BANK ONE/FIRST USA, MBNA, JP

MORGAN CHASE AND CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL) THAT ARE MEMBERS OF VISA AND/OR

MASTERCARD AND THAT ISSUE GENERAL PURPOSE CARDS, PRIMARILY UNDER REVOLVING

CREDIT PLANS, ON ONE OR BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS, AND THE MORGAN STANLEY AFFILIATE

THAT ISSUES THE DISCOVER CARD ON THE DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES NETWORK. TRS

ALSO ENCOUNTERS SOME VERY LIMITED COMPETITION FROM BUSINESSES THAT ISSUE THEIR

OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND

AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS ARE NOT GENERALLY SUBSTITUTES FOR

TRS' CARDS BECAUSE OF THEIR LIMITED ACCEPTANCE. AS A RESULT OF CONSOLIDATIONS

AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO

ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF

SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS AND THE LARGEST ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW USING THEIR

GREATER RESOURCES, ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND BRAND RECOGNITION TO COMPETE.

COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT

CARDHOLDERS INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT,

AIRLINE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS AND OTHER REWARD OR REBATE

PROGRAMS, "TEASER" PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CARD ACQUISITION AND

BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND CO-BRANDED ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER BENEFITS

TO CARDHOLDERS. TARGET CUSTOMERS ARE SEGMENTED BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS

FINANCIAL NEEDS AND PREFERENCES, BRAND LOYALTY, INTEREST IN REWARDS PROGRAMS AND

CREDITWORTHINESS, AND SPECIFIC PRODUCTS ARE TAILORED TO SPECIFIC CUSTOMER

SEGMENTS.

MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ALSO ISSUE

DEBIT CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR

POINT OF SALE PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED

ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE VISA OR MASTERCARD

LOGO AND ACCEPTED WHEREVER THOSE BRANDED CREDIT CARDS ARE ACCEPTED. AS A RESULT,

THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE U.S. HAS CONTINUED TO

INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. DEBIT CARDS ARE MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH AND

CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS ARE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL DOLLAR

AMOUNTS. WHILE DEBIT CARDS MAY BE USED INSTEAD OF CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS FOR

CERTAIN KINDS OF TRANSACTIONS, THEY ARE NOT GENERALLY SUBSTITUTES FOR CREDIT OR

CHARGE CARDS. TRS DOES NOT CURRENTLY OFFER POINT-OF-SALE DEBIT CARD PRODUCTS

IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS ARE

(I) THE FEATURES AND THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING REWARDS

PROGRAMS PROVIDED TO CARDMEMBERS; (II) THE NUMBER, SPENDING CHARACTERISTICS AND

CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF CARDMEMBERS; (III) THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE

ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT A CARD; (IV) THE COST OF CARDS TO

PAGE 12

CARDMEMBERS; (V) THE TERMS OF PAYMENT AVAILABLE TO CARDMEMBERS; (VI) THE NUMBER

AND QUALITY OF OTHER PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO CARDMEMBERS; (VII) THE

NATURE AND QUALITY OF EXPENSE MANAGEMENT DATA CAPTURE AND REPORTING CAPABILITY;

(VIII) THE SUCCESS OF TARGETED MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; (IX)

REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION; (X) THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS TO IMPLEMENT

OPERATIONAL AND COST EFFICIENCIES; AND (XI) THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TRS,

ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES ("CREDCO"), PURCHASES MOST CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES

ARISING FROM THE USE OF CARDS ISSUED IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN DESIGNATED

CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO FINANCES THE PURCHASE OF

RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE SALE OF

MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK FINANCES ITS REVOLVING CREDIT

RECEIVABLES THROUGH THE SALE OF SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND CERTIFICATES OF

DEPOSIT. TRS AND CENTURION BANK ALSO FUND RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET

SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS, WHICH COMPRISES PART OF ITS FINANCING STRATEGY. THE

COMPANY UTILIZES THE INCOME FROM ITS SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES TO HELP FUND

CERTAIN MARKETING AND PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. THE COST OF FUNDING CARDMEMBER

RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR EXPENSE OF CARD OPERATIONS. FOR A FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF TRS' AND CENTURION BANK'S SECURITIZATION AND OTHER FINANCING

ACTIVITIES, SEE PAGES 32-33, PAGES 36-37 AND PAGES 41-42 UNDER THE CAPTION

"FINANCIAL REVIEW," AND NOTE 4 ON PAGES 66-67 OF THE COMPANY'S 2002 ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS OF SUCH REPORT ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE.

CENTURION BANK'S DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION ("FDIC") FOR UP TO $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR. CENTURION BANK IS A

UTAH-CHARTERED INDUSTRIAL LOAN COMPANY REGULATED, SUPERVISED AND REGULARLY

EXAMINED BY THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE FDIC. AMONG

THE ACTIVITIES OF CENTURION BANK THAT ARE REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ARE ITS

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN STEPS TO

MAINTAIN A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE STANDARDS. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING INITIATIVES AFFECTING THE COMPANY, SEE

PAGE 58 HEREOF UNDER THE HEADING "CORPORATE AND OTHER."

THE CHARGE CARD, ATM AND CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (WHICH GENERALLY

PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION IN THE GRANTING AND HANDLING OF CREDIT); THE FAIR

CREDIT REPORTING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES USE BY CREDITORS OF

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS AND CREDIT PRESCREENING PRACTICES AND REQUIRES CERTAIN

DISCLOSURES WHEN AN APPLICATION FOR CREDIT IS REJECTED); THE TRUTH IN LENDING

ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS UPON

WHICH CREDIT IS GRANTED); THE FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, REGULATES THE MANNER THAT BILLING INQUIRIES ARE HANDLED AND SPECIFIES

CERTAIN BILLING REQUIREMENTS); THE FAIR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD DISCLOSURE ACT

(WHICH MANDATES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ON CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD APPLICATIONS); AND

THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACT (WHICH REGULATES DISCLOSURES AND SETTLEMENT OF

TRANSACTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS INCLUDING THOSE AT ATMS). CERTAIN

FEDERAL PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE COLLECTION AND USE OF

CUSTOMER INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SEE PAGE 57). FEDERAL

LEGISLATION ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A

NUMBER OF STATES AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION,

DISCLOSURE AND PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS. THE APPLICATION OF FEDERAL AND STATE

BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS

PAGE 13

AFFECT THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS RESULT IN AMOUNTS OWED BEING

CLASSIFIED AS DELINQUENT AND/OR CHARGED OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE. CARD ISSUERS AND

CARD NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND ANTI-TERRORISM

LEGISLATION, INCLUDING THE USA PATRIOT ACT (SEE PAGE 58 FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THIS LEGISLATION AND ITS EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS). CENTURION BANK IS

SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO

FDIC-INSURED, STATE-CHARTERED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS OR IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THEREOF

COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH CENTURION BANK CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS. THE

COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REFINES ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES IN

LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY

TRENDS SO THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND CONSISTENT

WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL

(THE "FFIEC"), AN INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF THE PRINCIPAL FEDERAL ENTITIES

THAT REGULATE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED IN FINAL FORM ITS

GUIDANCE ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES (THE

"GUIDANCE"). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE AREAS: (I) CREDIT LINE MANAGEMENT, (II)

OVER-LIMIT PRACTICES, (III) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION PRACTICES,

(IV) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES, AND (V) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION

AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES.

THE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE

SUPERVISION OF THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT COMPRISE THE FFIEC,

ALTHOUGH IT IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE BANK REGULATORS' IDENTIFYING IN

RECENT EXAMINATIONS OF OTHER CREDIT CARD LENDERS PRACTICES DEEMED BY THEM TO BE

INAPPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, WITH REGARD TO SUBPRIME

LENDING PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY LENDING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE

SUBPRIME MARKET. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ANY

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES, NOR WILL THE GUIDANCE

MANDATE ANY CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S PRACTICES.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL BUSINESS PROVIDES TRAVEL SERVICES TO

CONSUMERS THROUGH: AMERICAN EXPRESS-OWNED TRAVEL SERVICE OFFICES; AMERICAN

EXPRESS REPRESENTATIVES, WHICH ARE TRAVEL OFFICES INDEPENDENTLY OWNED BY THIRD

PARTIES; AND AMERICAN EXPRESS CALL CENTERS, WHICH OFFER TRAVEL SERVICES TO

PLATINUM CARD'R', CENTURION'R' CARD AND OTHER CARDMEMBERS. THROUGH THESE

FACILITIES, CARDMEMBERS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE SERVICE IN PERSON, BY PHONE OR BY

FAX, IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY'S ONLINE SERVICING. THE CONSUMER TRAVEL BUSINESS

ALSO OPERATES A WHOLESALE TRAVEL BUSINESS SELLING TRAVEL PACKAGES TO OTHER

RETAIL TRAVEL AGENTS. SINCE A LARGE NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER AND SMALL

BUSINESS CARDMEMBERS ARE ALSO ACTIVE LEISURE TRAVELERS, TRS SEEKS TO USE ITS

CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK TO BETTER SERVE ITS CUSTOMERS AND GROW THE BUSINESS

DESPITE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING COMPETITIVE PRESSURES. SEE PAGE 16 FOR A

DISCUSSION OF COMPETITION IN THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY.

TRS' TRAVEL NETWORK OF MORE THAN 1,700 RETAIL TRAVEL LOCATIONS IS IMPORTANT

IN SUPPORTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND PROVIDING CUSTOMER SERVICE

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TRS CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THIS STRUCTURE TO DETERMINE THE

BEST WAY TO LEVERAGE THE STRENGTH OF THE TRAVEL NETWORK. AT THE SAME TIME, TRS

IS DEVELOPING WAYS TO BETTER SERVE THE TRAVEL CONSUMER, INCLUDING 1-800 TYPE

SERVICES AND INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

PAGE 14

GLOBAL CORPORATE SERVICES

TRS' GLOBAL CORPORATE SERVICES GROUP ("GCSG") PROVIDES CORPORATE CARD,

CORPORATE TRAVEL, CORPORATE PURCHASING CARD ("CPC") AND CONSULTING SERVICES TO

BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD. IN ADDITION TO BEING A LEADING PROVIDER OF SUCH

SERVICES TO LARGE-MARKET BUSINESSES, GCSG HAS A STRONG PRESENCE AMONG MIDDLE-

MARKET COMPANIES (THOSE IN THE U.S. WITH ANNUAL REVENUES OF $10 MILLION TO

$1 BILLION AND ANNUAL TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENDITURES BETWEEN $100,000

AND $10 MILLION). THE CORPORATE MIDDLE MARKET IS A RAPIDLY EXPANDING SEGMENT

THAT OFFERS GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH. IN 2002, GCSG INVESTED HEAVILY IN THE

MIDDLE MARKET, EXPANDING MARKETING EFFORTS AND ADDING SALES STAFF IN 13

COUNTRIES. IT ALSO LAUNCHED THE SAVINGS AT WORK'SM' PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES U.S.

MID-SIZED FIRMS WITH SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNTS ON EVERYDAY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES AND A RANGE OF BUSINESS SERVICES, AND IT ENHANCED THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO MID-SIZED FIRMS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

COMPANIES ARE OFFERED SERVICES THROUGH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' CORPORATE

CARD, WHICH IS A CHARGE CARD ISSUED TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGH A CORPORATE

ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY THEIR EMPLOYER FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.

THE CPC ASSISTS LARGE- AND MIDDLE-MARKET COMPANIES IN MANAGING INDIRECT

SPENDING, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL PURCHASING ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES. THE CPC IS

USED BY CORPORATIONS TO BUY EVERYDAY GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES

AND INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT, IN 23 MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS TYPE

OF SPENDING BY CORPORATIONS IS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO DOWNTURNS IN DIFFICULT

ECONOMIC TIMES THAN IS TRADITIONAL TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING, AND IS

THEREBY HELPING TO DIVERSIFY THE COMPANY'S SPENDING MIX. DURING 2002, TRS ADDED

OR EXPANDED CORPORATE CARD AND CORPORATE PURCHASING CARD RELATIONSHIPS AROUND

THE WORLD INCLUDING THOSE WITH ACCENTURE, HALLIBURTON, HILTON HOTELS, PEPSICO,

PROCTER & GAMBLE, SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY AND UNISYS CORPORATION.

COMPETITION IN THE COMMERCIAL CARD (CORPORATE CARD AND CPC) BUSINESS IS

INCREASINGLY INTENSE AT BOTH THE CARD NETWORK AND CARD ISSUER LEVELS. AT THE

NETWORK LEVEL, DINERS CLUB REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL COMPETITOR. IN ADDITION,

BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE STEPPED-UP EFFORTS TO SUPPORT CARD ISSUERS SUCH AS

U.S. BANK, JP MORGAN CHASE, GE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CITIBANK (IN THE U.S. AND

GLOBALLY), WHO ARE WILLING TO BUILD AND SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING

NECESSARY TO SATISFY CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, MASTERCARD

HAS PROMOTED ENHANCED WEB-BASED SUPPORT FOR ITS CORPORATE CARD ISSUING MEMBERS,

AND VISA INTERNATIONAL SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF A JOINT VENTURE BY A NUMBER OF

ITS MEMBER BANKS FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO COMPETE AGAINST GCSG AND DINERS CLUB

FOR THE BUSINESS OF MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES. THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE

COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS ARE (I) THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE AND DELIVER DETAILED

TRANSACTION DATA AND EXPENSE MANAGEMENT REPORTS; (II) THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF

BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARDS; (III) PRICING; (IV) THE RANGE AND

INNOVATIVENESS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO SUIT BUSINESS NEEDS; (V) QUALITY OF

CUSTOMER SERVICES; AND (VI) GLOBAL PRESENCE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF COMPETITION

RELATING TO THE CARD ISSUING BUSINESS, SEE PAGES 4 AND 12.

PAGE 15

GCSG OFFERS INTEGRATED COMMERCIAL CARD AND BUSINESS TRAVEL SERVICES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO COMPETE FOR THE BUSINESS TRAVELER

AND TO PROVIDE CLIENT COMPANIES WITH A CUSTOMIZED APPROACH TO MANAGING THEIR

TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT BUDGETS. CLIENTS ARE PROVIDED AN INFORMATION PACKAGE TO

PLAN, ACCOUNT FOR AND CONTROL TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES. CPC SOLUTIONS

CAN ALSO BE PACKAGED AS COMPLIMENTARY EXPENSE MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING TOOLS.

GCSG PROVIDES A WIDE VARIETY OF TRAVEL SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS TRAVELING FOR

BUSINESS AND IS ONE OF THE LEADING BUSINESS TRAVEL PROVIDERS WORLDWIDE. FOR

CORPORATE TRAVEL ACCOUNTS, GCSG PROVIDES CORPORATE TRAVEL POLICY CONSULTATION,

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND GROUP AND INCENTIVE TRAVEL SERVICES IN 37

MARKETS WORLDWIDE, OF WHICH 31 ARE PROPRIETARY OPERATIONS AND SIX ARE MANAGED

THROUGH JOINT VENTURES.

GCSG FACES VIGOROUS COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD FROM

NUMEROUS OTHER TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AS WELL AS

FROM DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS. COMPETITION AMONG

TRAVEL AGENCIES IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE, CONVENIENCE AND PROXIMITY TO

THE CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, COMPETITION COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES

AS MANY COMPANIES HAVE BECOME ACCREDITED AS IN-HOUSE CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS.

IN 2001, FIVE OF THE LARGEST U.S. CARRIERS LAUNCHED ORBITZ, AN ONLINE

TRAVEL AGENCY FROM WHICH TRAVELERS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS INFORMATION REGARDING A

LARGE SELECTION OF AIRFARES FROM MANY AIRLINES, INCLUDING WEB-ONLY FARES,

WHICH MAY IN SOME CASES BE LOWER THAN FARES THAT CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH

TRADITIONAL TRAVEL AGENCIES. THE WEBSITE ALSO PROVIDES OFFERS ON CAR RENTALS

AND OTHER TRAVEL. IN ADDITION, ORBITZ PROVIDES ACCESS TO RATES ON HOTEL ROOMS

IN BOTH INDEPENDENT HOTELS AND HOTELS IN CERTAIN MAJOR NATIONAL CHAINS, WHICH

MAY BE LOWER THAN RATES THAT COULD BE OBTAINED THROUGH TRADITIONAL TRAVEL

AGENCIES. WHILE ORBITZ IS TARGETED PRIMARILY TOWARD THE LEISURE TRAVELER,

BUSINESS TRAVELERS ARE INCREASINGLY USING ORBITZ AND OTHER AIRLINE-OWNED

WEBSITES TO GAIN ACCESS TO WEB-ONLY FARES. OTHER ONLINE AGENCIES, FORMERLY

SPECIALIZING IN TARGETED SALES TO LEISURE TRAVELERS, SUCH AS EXPEDIA AND

TRAVELOCITY, HAVE BEGUN TO PURSUE CORPORATE TRAVEL CUSTOMERS, INITIALLY IN THE

SMALL AND MID-SIZED MARKETS.

IN 2002, GCSG EXPANDED ITS PRESENCE IN ASIA BY OPENING JOINT VENTURE

OPERATIONS THROUGH CITS (CHINA INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL SERVICES) AMERICAN EXPRESS

TRAVEL SERVICES LIMITED, LAUNCHING BUSINESS TRAVEL CENTERS IN BEIJING AND

SHANGHAI. THIS VENTURE SERVES MULTINATIONAL, PAN-REGIONAL AND LOCAL CORPORATIONS

TRAVELING TO AND FROM THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. THE CITS

PAGE 16

AMERICAN EXPRESS PARTNERSHIP IS THE FIRST CORPORATE TRAVEL JOINT VENTURE FULLY

LICENSED TO SELL BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE TICKETS IN CHINA.

AIRLINES HAVE CONTINUED EFFORTS TO REDUCE THEIR DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES. FOR

EXAMPLE, IN MARCH 2002, ALL OF THE MAJOR U.S. AIRLINES AND SOME INTERNATIONAL

CARRIERS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NO LONGER PAY ANY "BASE" COMMISSIONS TO

TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD IN THE U.S. AND CANADA FOR ALL DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL. IN ADDITION, IN 2002, AIRLINES CONTINUED EFFORTS TO MOVE

CORPORATE CUSTOMERS TO THEIR OWN PROPRIETARY DIRECT BILLING AND PAYMENT

PRODUCTS, SUCH AS UATP, AND MADE ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT THE USE OF CREDIT AND CHARGE

CARDS FOR WEB-ONLY CORPORATE FARES. IN ADDITION, AIRLINES CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN

AND EXPAND ALLIANCES FOR MARKETING, CODE SHARE AND OTHER SERVICE DELIVERY

PURPOSES. THOSE ACTIONS AND THE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN HAVE CAUSED SOME

INDEPENDENT TRAVEL AGENCIES TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND, AS REFERENCED ABOVE,

FORCED OTHERS TO SEEK CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES. CONSOLIDATION OF TRAVEL

AGENCIES IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS AGENCIES SEEK TO BETTER SERVE NATIONAL AND

MULTINATIONAL BUSINESS TRAVEL CLIENTS AND NEGOTIATE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE

AIRLINES. IT IS ALSO EXPECTED THAT TRAVEL AGENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR

EXPENSE REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS FOCUSING ON ELECTRONIC TICKETING AND

INTERACTIVE TRAVEL FULFILLMENT SOLUTIONS.

GCSG HAS HISTORICALLY RECEIVED COMMISSIONS AND FEES FOR TICKETING AND

RESERVATIONS FROM AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS, AND MANAGEMENT AND

TRANSACTION FEES FROM CERTAIN CORPORATE TRAVEL ACCOUNTS. THE ONGOING TREND OF

AIRLINE ALLIANCES, AIRLINE WEBSITES PERMITTING TRAVELERS TO BOOK BUSINESS

DIRECTLY AND AIRLINE COMMISSION RATE REDUCTIONS CONTINUES TO RESULT IN DECREASED

BUSINESS TRAVEL REVENUE FOR TRAVEL COMPANIES AND PRICE INCREASES FOR TRAVELERS,

FEWER OPPORTUNITIES FOR DATA AGGREGATION FOR CORPORATIONS AND GREATER PRESSURE

ON THE GCSG TRAVEL BUSINESS. THROUGHOUT 2002, GCSG, SIMILAR TO OTHER TRAVEL

MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, TESTED AND UTILIZED ON BEHALF OF ITS CUSTOMERS MULTIPLE

TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO ASSURE ACCESS TO INVENTORY AND ALL AIRFARES, FORMERLY

CLASSIFIED AS "WEB-ONLY" FARES. LATE IN 2002, GCSG ANNOUNCED ITS TRAVELBAHN'SM'

DISTRIBUTION SOLUTION, A PROPRIETARY NETWORK ALTERNATIVE, WHICH WILL PROVIDE

ACCESS TO ALL AMERICAN AIRLINES INVENTORY AND FARES FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS

CORPORATE TRAVEL CUSTOMERS.

GCSG CONTINUES TO MODIFY ITS BUSINESS MODEL AND INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES

TO ADDRESS THESE ONGOING INDUSTRY CHALLENGES. FOR EXAMPLE, GCSG HAS BEEN

SUCCESSFUL IN ITS EFFORTS TO RELY LESS ON COMMISSION REVENUES FROM SUPPLIERS,

SUCH AS AIRLINES OR HOTELS, AND NOW RELIES MORE ON CUSTOMERS TO PAY TRANSACTION

FEES FOR ITS TRAVEL SERVICES. IN 2002, ONLY 28 PERCENT OF U.S. CORPORATE TRAVEL

REVENUES CAME FROM AIRLINES, HOTELS, RENTAL CAR COMPANIES AND OTHER SUPPLIERS,

AND 72 PERCENT CAME FROM CUSTOMERS. A FEW YEARS AGO, THE MIX WAS APPROXIMATELY

THE REVERSE.

THESE CHANGES TO GCSG'S SOURCES OF REVENUE ENABLED CORPORATE TRAVEL TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE ITS BUSINESS IN ONE OF THE TOUGHEST YEARS IN RECENT HISTORY

FOR THE BUSINESS TRAVEL INDUSTRY. THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE IMPACTED

BY WORLD EVENTS AND CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THREAT OF WAR, TERRORISM

AND A GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAVE DEPRESSED BOTH BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAVEL

AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO. IN 2002, BOTH UNITED AIRLINES AND USAIR FILED FOR

CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN THE U.S., WHILE BOTH AIRLINES CONTINUE TO

OPERATE WITH REDUCED CAPACITY IN ATTEMPTS TO LOWER THEIR COST BASE. 2002 ALSO

SAW THE SIGNIFICANT RISE IN POPULARITY AND PROFITABILITY FOR THE LOW-COST

CARRIER SEGMENT IN THE U.S., EUROPE AND ASIA. IN THE

PAGE 17

PAST, THIS SEGMENT HAD PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON LEISURE TRAVELERS, WHILE 2002 SAW A

DRAMATIC RISE IN THE NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF BUSINESS TRAVELERS USING THESE

LOW-COST AIRLINES.

GCSG TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE DOWNTURN IN TRAVEL TO STEP UP SALES EFFORTS. IT

WAS AWARDED THE CORPORATE TRAVEL BUSINESS OF COMPANIES INCLUDING MONSANTO

COMPANY; NESTLE USA; NOKIA, INC.; PANASONIC; AND THE SHELL COMPANY OF AUSTRALIA

LIMITED.

AS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COMPANY, GCSG HAS MOVED MANY OF ITS BUSINESS

PROCESSES AND CUSTOMER SERVICING ONLINE TO REDUCE COSTS, IMPROVE PROCESSES AND

ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. BY YEAR-END 2002, 16% OF ALL CORPORATE

TRAVEL TRANSACTIONS IN THE U.S. WERE CONDUCTED ONLINE. THIS ONLINE DELIVERY

OPTIMIZES SAVINGS FOR CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND ENHANCES GCSG PROFITABILITY

THROUGH LOWER-COST SERVICING. EXPANDING ON THE MOMENTUM FROM U.S. CORPORATIONS

MIGRATION TO BOOKING THEIR COMPANY TRAVEL ONLINE, GCSG OPENED TWO NEW

E-FULFILLMENT CENTERS IN EUROPE -- IN STOCKHOLM AND NICE -- TO COMPLEMENT THE

NORTH AMERICAN E-FULFILLMENT CENTER IN MIAMI LAKES, FLORIDA, WHICH HAS BEEN

OPERATIONAL SINCE 2001. BY SHIFTING TRAVEL RESERVATIONS FROM THE TELEPHONE

ONTO A WEBSITE, GCSG IS ABLE TO IMPROVE SUBSTANTIALLY EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY AND

DRIVE DOWN COSTS. EMPLOYEES AT ONLINE FULFILLMENT CENTERS PROCESS ALMOST 7,000

TRANSACTIONS PER YEAR COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 1,400 FOR OFFLINE SERVICING.

SIMILARLY, GCSG'S INTERNET APPLICATION FOR THE CORPORATE CARD SEGMENT,

AMEX@WORK, GIVES CLIENTS A FASTER, SIMPLER WAY TO WORK WITH THE COMPANY. DURING

2002, GCSG OFFERED AMERICAN EXPRESS @ WORK'R' EXPENSE REPORTING AND PURCHASE

RECONCILIATION, AN ONLINE TOOL WHICH HELPS COMPANIES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES TRACK

AND FILE EXPENSE REPORTS AND RECONCILE EVERYDAY PURCHASES. TRS ALSO ENHANCED

AMERICAN EXPRESS @ WORK BY ADDING A SEARCHABLE DATABASE THAT CORPORATE TRAVEL

MANAGERS CAN ACCESS TO KEEP TRACK OF EMPLOYEES' TRAVEL RESERVATIONS. OVER 11,000

CORPORATE ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATORS NOW GO ONLINE TO PERFORM MOST OF THEIR ACCOUNT

MAINTENANCE, RATHER THAN CONTACTING THE COMPANY BY PHONE, FAX OR MAIL. SINCE ITS

LAUNCH IN 1999, THE PERCENTAGE OF CORPORATE CARD MAINTENANCE TRANSACTIONS

COMPLETED ONLINE THROUGH AMEX@WORK HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY AND THIS CHANNEL NOW

HANDLES 63 PERCENT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS.

GCSG HAS ALSO DEVELOPED RELATIONSHIPS WITH A NUMBER OF E-COMMERCE FIRMS TO

PROVIDE A FASTER, MORE EFFICIENT WAY FOR CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE OFFICE SUPPLIES

AND RELATED PRODUCTS USING THE CPC. IN MARCH 2002, GCSG ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS

ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH IBM TO JOINTLY DEVELOP A WEB-BASED EXPENSE

REPORTING AND RECONCILIATION TOOL DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE COST OF MANAGING

EVERYDAY BUSINESS EXPENSES. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, GCSG PLANS TO MARKET THE

APPLICATION AS PART OF ITS AMERICAN EXPRESS @ WORK SUITE OF ONLINE EXPENSE

MANAGEMENT TOOLS.

GCSG, THROUGH ITS CONSUMER TRAVEL INTERNATIONAL AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

SERVICES GROUP ("CTI & FES"), PROVIDES TRAVEL SERVICES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND

CARDMEMBER SERVICES THROUGH A RETAIL NETWORK OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-OWNED AND

FRANCHISED OFFICES. CTI & FES EXPANDED ITS GLOBAL RETAIL PRESENCE IN AUSTRALIA

AND SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND EXTENDED ITS PARTNERSHIPS IN INDIA, THAILAND, TURKEY AND

THE UNITED STATES. TRS FURTHER EXPANDED ITS RETAIL NETWORK THROUGH AGGRESSIVE

GROWTH AT INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT LOCATIONS; PARIS' CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT AND

LONDON'S HEATHROW AIRPORT BEING NOTABLE RECENT ADDITIONS TO THE NETWORK. CTI &

FES ALSO PROVIDES ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS THROUGH AN INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS

SERVICE. OFFERED IN THE U.S., AUSTRALIA AND THE UK, THIS SERVICE OFFERS SMALL

BUSINESSES AND BANKING CUSTOMERS AN INTERNET-BASED SOURCE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO

FOREIGN SUPPLIERS.

GLOBAL TRAVELERS CHEQUE AND PREPAID SERVICES

THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS GLOBAL TRAVELERS CHEQUE AND PREPAID SERVICES GROUP

("TCPS"), IS A LEADING ISSUER OF TRAVELERS CHECKS. THE COMPANY ALSO ISSUES MONEY

ORDER AND

PAGE 18

OFFICIAL CHECK PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THE TRAVELFUNDS DIRECT'R'

PRODUCT, WHICH PROVIDES DIRECT DELIVERY OF FOREIGN BANK NOTES AND TRAVELERS

CHEQUES IN SELECTED MARKETS.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' TRAVELERS CHEQUE ("TRAVELERS CHEQUE" OR "CHEQUE")

IS SOLD AS A SAFE AND CONVENIENT ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENCY. THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE

IS A NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT, HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE AND IS PAYABLE BY THE ISSUER

IN THE CURRENCY OF ISSUANCE WHEN PRESENTED FOR THE PURCHASE OF GOODS AND

SERVICES OR FOR REDEMPTION. IN 2002, TCPS LAUNCHED ENHANCED SERVICES FOR

TRAVELERS CHEQUE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING PASSPORT AND CREDIT REPLACEMENT

ASSISTANCE. GIFT CHEQUES, A TYPE OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE, ARE USED FOR GIFT-GIVING

PURPOSES.

TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE ISSUED IN EIGHT CURRENCIES, INCLUDING A

EURO-DENOMINATED TRAVELERS CHEQUE, BOTH DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY AND THROUGH

JOINT VENTURE COMPANIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY GENERALLY HOLDS AN EQUITY INTEREST.

GIFT CHEQUES ARE ISSUED IN TWO CURRENCIES, U.S. DOLLARS AND CANADIAN DOLLARS. AS

A RESULT OF THE FINAL CONVERSION IN EARLY 2002 OF CERTAIN EUROPEAN CURRENCIES TO

THE EURO, THE COMPANY CEASED SELLING THE FRENCH FRANC, GERMAN MARK AND DUTCH

GUILDER TRAVELERS CHEQUES AS OF THE END OF 2001. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL

CONTINUE TO HONOR, REDEEM, AND REFUND CHEQUES IN THESE CURRENCIES FOR EUROS,

SINCE THEY DO NOT EXPIRE.

AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE SOLD THROUGH A BROAD NETWORK OF

SELLING OUTLETS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING TRAVEL OFFICES OF THE COMPANY, ITS

AFFILIATES AND REPRESENTATIVES; TRAVEL AGENTS; COMMERCIAL BANKS; SAVINGS BANKS;

SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS; CREDIT UNIONS; AND OTHER FINANCIAL, TRAVEL AND

COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY SOMETIMES COMPENSATES SELLING OUTLETS FOR

THEIR SALE OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES. IN 2002, THE COMPANY'S SALE OF TRAVELERS

CHEQUES AND GIFT CHEQUES OVER THE INTERNET CONTINUED TO GROW STRONGLY. DURING

THE YEAR, OVERALL TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES DECREASED 6.2 PERCENT GLOBALLY, AND

CONSUMER GIFT CHEQUE SALES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 14 PERCENT. WHILE GIFT CHEQUE

GROWTH CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO NEW ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS, IT IS

BELIEVED THAT THE LAG IN TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES WAS DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUING

GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND THE REDUCTION IN BOTH BUSINESS AND PERSONAL TRAVEL.

PARTNERSHIPS WITH SELLERS CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL TO THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE

GROUP AS TRS EXPANDS ITS SALES DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. IN 2002, TCPS LOST THE

ACCOUNT OF THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION, A MAJOR SELLER IN THE UNITED

STATES, BUT GAINED A NUMBER OF NEW SELLERS, INCLUDING ABBEY NATIONAL IN THE UK;

SAUDI AMERICAN BANK; STA TRAVEL IN GERMANY; AND TOKYO CREDIT SERVICE.

THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY ARE

INVESTED PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY-RATED DEBT SECURITIES CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF

INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS.

ISSUERS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS AND MONEY ORDERS ARE REGULATED UNDER MOST

STATES' "MONEY TRANSMITTER" LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHECK ISSUERS TO

OBTAIN LICENSES, TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD

OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN HIGHLY RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO

PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. MANY STATES AUDIT TRAVELERS CHEQUE AND MONEY ORDER

LICENSEES ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION, TRAVELERS CHEQUE AND MONEY ORDER ISSUERS ARE

REQUIRED TO

PAGE 19

COMPLY WITH STATE AND FOREIGN UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS. THE STATE

LAWS REQUIRE ISSUERS TO PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY TRAVELERS CHEQUE OR

MONEY ORDER THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF YEARS.

OUTSIDE THE U.S., THERE ARE VARYING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME COUNTRIES WITH

REQUIREMENTS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE U.S. ON DECEMBER 31, 2001, NEW FEDERAL

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS BECAME EFFECTIVE. THESE REGULATIONS REQUIRED,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELER CHECK AND MONEY ORDER ISSUERS

AS "MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES" AND COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

RECORDING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY ISSUERS AND SELLING OUTLETS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF OTHER ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES AFFECTING THE

TRAVELERS CHEQUE GROUP, SEE PAGE 58 UNDER THE HEADING "CORPORATE AND OTHER."

TRAVELERS CHEQUES COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT

PRODUCTS. CONSUMERS MAY CHOOSE TO USE THEIR CREDIT OR CHARGE CARDS WHEN THEY

TRAVEL INSTEAD OF CARRYING TRAVELERS CHEQUES, ALTHOUGH A TRAVELERS CHEQUE WOULD

NOT TYPICALLY BE AN ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTE FOR MOST TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH CREDIT

OR CHARGE CARDS. OTHER PAYMENT MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT SUBSTITUTE FOR TRAVELERS

CHEQUES INCLUDE CASH, CHECKS, OTHER BRANDS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, DEBIT CARDS AND

CARDS ACCEPTED AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE NETWORKS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE TRAVELERS CHECK INDUSTRY ARE (I)

THE AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER OF OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT; (II) THE AMOUNT OF

THE FEE CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER; (III) THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF

TRAVELERS CHECKS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD; (IV) THE COMPENSATION PAID TO, AND

FREQUENCY OF SETTLEMENT BY, SELLING OUTLETS; (V) THE ACCESSIBILITY OF TRAVELERS

CHECK SALES AND REFUNDS; (VI) THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL

CAMPAIGNS; AND (VII) THE ABILITY TO SERVICE THE CHECK PURCHASER SATISFACTORILY

IF THE CHECKS ARE LOST OR STOLEN.

TCPS HAS ALSO GROWN ITS PREPAID CARD BUSINESS. IN 2002, THE GROUP LAUNCHED

A GENERAL RETAIL GIFTING PRODUCT, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GIFT CARD, AND CONTINUED

TO OFFER THE BE MY GUEST'R' CARD, A PREPAID CARD PRODUCT USED TO GIVE THE GIFT

OF RESTAURANT DINING. TCPS IS CONTINUALLY LOOKING INTO ADDITIONAL PREPAID

PRODUCTS BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHERS.

OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

INTERACTIVE SERVICES AND NEW BUSINESSES ("IS&NB;") LEVERAGES INTERACTIVE

TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOP NEW BUSINESSES AND ENHANCE EXISTING BUSINESSES. IS&NB;

LEADS AND COORDINATES THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE COMPANY'S ENTERPRISE-WIDE

INTERACTIVE STRATEGY WITH A FOCUS ON PROVIDING INTERNET AND INTERACTIVE

CAPABILITIES TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO LEVERAGE THE INTERNET TO LOWER COSTS AND IMPROVE

SERVICE QUALITY. DURING 2002, IT EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF SERVICES AND

CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS ONLINE AND INCREASED THEIR UTILIZATION. FOR

EXAMPLE, WITHIN THE U.S., APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S CARD

SERVICING TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW AVAILABLE ONLINE. THE COMPANY NOW HAS MORE ONLINE

INTERACTIONS WITH CUSTOMERS THAN IT DOES BY TELEPHONE OR IN PERSON.

AT YEAR-END, APPROXIMATELY NINE MILLION CARDS WERE ENROLLED IN "MANAGE YOUR

CARD ACCOUNT SERVICE." THIS SERVICE ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO REVIEW AND PAY THEIR

AMERICAN EXPRESS BILLS ELECTRONICALLY, VIEW THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS'R' ACCOUNTS

AND CONDUCT VARIOUS OTHER

PAGE 20

FUNCTIONS QUICKLY AND SECURELY ONLINE. THE COMPANY NOW HAS AN ONLINE PRESENCE IN

OVER 50 MARKETS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS TAX AND BUSINESS SERVICES INC. ("TBS") IS A TAX,

ACCOUNTING, CONSULTING AND BUSINESS ADVISORY FIRM FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON SMALL AND

MIDDLE-MARKET COMPANIES. TBS PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES FOR A FEE,

INCLUDING TAX PLANNING AND ACCOUNTING, LITIGATION SUPPORT, BUSINESS

REORGANIZATION, BUSINESS ADVISORY, BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER CONSULTING

SERVICES. IN ADDITION, TBS HAS EXPERTISE IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING

HEALTH CARE, REAL ESTATE, MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION, AMONG OTHERS. TBS

EMPLOYS CPAS BUT IS NOT A LICENSED CPA FIRM. ATTESTATION SERVICES FOR ITS

CLIENTS ARE AVAILABLE FROM LICENSED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS WITH WHOM TBS HAS

CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES RELATIONSHIPS. TBS HAS MORE THAN 50 OFFICES IN

17 STATES WITH APPROXIMATELY 2,700 EMPLOYEES.

AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS

OVERVIEW

THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS BUSINESS UNIT

("AEFA"), MAKES AVAILABLE A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO HELP

INDIVIDUALS, BUSINESSES AND INSTITUTIONS ESTABLISH AND ACHIEVE THEIR FINANCIAL

GOALS. THIS BUSINESS UNIT PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL

CORPORATION ("AEFC") AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES DESCRIBED BELOW. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, AEFA MAINTAINED A NATIONWIDE FIELD SALES FORCE OF OVER 11,600

FINANCIAL ADVISORS, WHICH REPRESENTS A SLIGHT INCREASE OVER 2001 AND WHICH

PROVIDED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MORE THAN TWO MILLION CLIENTS THROUGHOUT THE

U.S.

THE CORE OF AEFA'S BUSINESS IS FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE. AEFA'S

FINANCIAL ADVISORS WORK WITH RETAIL CLIENTS TO DEVELOP STRONG RELATIONSHIPS

AND LONG-TERM FINANCIAL STRATEGIES. TO FULFILL THE NEEDS OF ITS RETAIL

CLIENTS, AEFA ALSO DEVELOPS AND OFFERS A BROAD ARRAY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INCLUDING ANNUITIES; A VARIETY OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LIFE

INSURANCE, DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE AND PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE; A

VARIETY OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES AND MUTUAL

FUNDS; INVESTMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING WRAP PROGRAMS; A VARIETY OF

TAX-QUALIFIED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS,

EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS AND SECTION 529 COLLEGE SAVINGS PLANS;

PERSONAL TRUST SERVICES; AND RETAIL SECURITIES BROKERAGE, INCLUDING ONLINE

DIRECT BROKERAGE SERVICES.

AEFA BELIEVES THAT ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE BROAD-BASED PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES ON A RELATIONSHIP BASIS IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. DUE TO

SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND AN OVERALL DECLINE IN THE EQUITY MARKETS,

INVESTMENT FLOW FROM AEFA'S RETAIL INVESTORS HAS SLOWED AND MANY COMPETITORS

HAVE ALSO SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES. TO COMPETE, MAJOR BROKERAGE FIRMS ARE

ATTEMPTING TO MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR HISTORICAL TRANSACTION ORIENTATION AND MOVE

TOWARD FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE, AEFA'S HISTORICAL FOCUS AND LONGSTANDING

STRENGTH. UNLIKE MANY OF AEFA'S COMPETITORS, WHOSE FIELD FORCES TYPICALLY

COMPRISE BROKERS WHO FOCUS ON COMPLETING TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF AEFA'S ADVISORS

ARE CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER'R''PP'1 PRACTITIONERS WHO ALSO WORK CLOSELY

WITH CLIENTS TO DEVELOP LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLANS. AS A RESULT, AEFA HAS A

CLIENT RETENTION RATE OF 94 PERCENT, AND IN 2002, THE REDEMPTION RATES IN ITS

PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUND PRODUCT CONTINUED TO COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH INDUSTRY

LEVELS, EVEN IN LIGHT OF THE DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT AEFA FACED DURING THE YEAR.

AEFA CONTINUES TO INVEST CONSIDERABLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS AND

TRAINING FOR ITS ADVISORS TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THEIR ABILITY TO OFFER SOUND

ADVICE AND FINANCIAL PLANS. DURING 2002, NEARLY 47 PERCENT OF NEW RETAIL CLIENTS

HAD A FINANCIAL PLAN DEVELOPED FOR THEM BY AN AEFA ADVISOR, UP THREE PERCENT

FROM 2001. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE HISTORICALLY, CLIENTS WITH PLANS TEND TO BUY

MORE PRODUCTS. IN 2002, PRODUCT SALES GENERATED THROUGH FINANCIAL PLANNING AND

ADVICE SERVICES WERE 73 PERCENT OF TOTAL ADVISOR SALES, UP ONE PERCENT FROM LAST

YEAR.

(1)  REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER BOARD OF STANDARDS,

INC.

PAGE 22

AEFA ALSO OFFERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DIRECTLY TO INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS

ASSET MANAGEMENT, INSTITUTIONAL TRUST AND CUSTODY, WORKPLACE-BASED FINANCIAL

EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL PLANNING, AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ADMINISTRATION. AEFA

ALSO MARKETS FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITY AND VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE

PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

IN RECENT YEARS, AEFA HAS INCREASED ITS SALE OF NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS,

PARTICULARLY MUTUAL FUNDS, TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF CLIENTS FOR A BROADER CHOICE

OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS. THE SALES OF NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS ON A STAND-ALONE

BASIS GENERALLY ARE LESS PROFITABLE THAN PROPRIETARY SALES. A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF AEFA'S NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUND SALES ARE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH

WRAP PROGRAMS WHERE CLIENTS PAY AEFA A FEE THAT IS TYPICALLY A PERCENTAGE OF

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, AND WHICH ARE MORE PROFITABLE THAN THE SALE OF

NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS ALONE. IN 2002, OVERALL MUTUAL FUND SALES BY AEFA

DECREASED RELATIVE TO THE SALE OF FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITIES, WHICH HAVE A

LOWER RETURN ON EQUITY.

IN 2002, AEFA TOOK VARIOUS STEPS TO SUPPORT CONTINUED GROWTH OF ITS

BUSINESS.

O    IT FURTHER REFINED THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE FOR ITS FIELD SALES

FORCE TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE FOCUS AND PRODUCTIVITY.

O    IT TOOK VARIOUS ACTIONS TO IMPROVE ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY AND

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE TO INCREASE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF ITS

PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING.

-    LAUNCHING 34 NEW PRODUCTS ACROSS ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT, INSURANCE

AND ANNUITY BUSINESSES, INCLUDING FOUR NEW EQUITY AND FIXED

INCOME INTERNALLY MANAGED MUTUAL FUNDS AND FOUR NEW SUB-ADVISED

EQUITY MUTUAL FUNDS IN THE INTERNATIONAL, MID- AND SMALL-CAP

CATEGORIES BY PARTNERING WITH FUND MANAGERS WITH PROVEN TRACK

RECORDS OF STRONG PERFORMANCE;

-    INCREASING THE STRENGTH AND DEPTH OF ITS OWN INVESTMENT TALENT,

INCLUDING THE HIRING OF A NEW SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF FIXED

INCOME AND SEVERAL OTHER EXPERIENCED INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS AND

THE ACQUISITION OF A QUANTITATIVE INVESTMENT ANALYSIS FIRM. IN

ADDITION, IN EARLY 2003, AEFA REORGANIZED ITS FIXED INCOME

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT STAFF INTO TEAMS RESPONSIBLE FOR RESEARCH,

TRADING AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT IN SPECIFIC FIXED INCOME

SECTORS; AND

-    RESTRUCTURING ITS U.S. EQUITY INVESTMENT OPERATION BY

ESTABLISHING OR EXPANDING SATELLITE OFFICES IN BOSTON, CAMBRIDGE,

NEW YORK AND SAN DIEGO. EACH OF THE SATELLITE OFFICES, IN

ADDITION TO THE MINNEAPOLIS OFFICE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING

SEVERAL EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. MINNEAPOLIS CONTINUES TO BE

A CENTER FOR BOTH PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH.

IN 2002, DEPRESSED EQUITY MARKET LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED AEFA'S

BUSINESS. AMONG OTHER AREAS, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT DECLINED, AS WELL AS

MANAGEMENT FEES RELATED TO SUCH ASSETS, BOTH DUE TO DEPRECIATION IN ASSET

VALUES, AS WELL AS FUND OUTFLOWS, PARTICULARLY THOSE INVESTED IN GROWTH-ORIENTED

MUTUAL FUNDS. IN 2002, OTHER MARKET-BASED EVENTS ALSO IMPACTED

PAGE 23

AEFA'S BUSINESS INCLUDING THE CONTINUATION OF RELATIVELY HIGH DEFAULT RATES IN

THE CORPORATE DEBT MARKETS. SEE "IMPACT OF RECENT MARKET VOLATILITY ON RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS" ON PAGE 46 OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.

DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AEFA HAS THREE PRIMARY FINANCIAL SERVICE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS: RETAIL,

WHICH IS COMPRISED OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND DIRECT ACCESS (ONLINE, TELEPHONE

AND MAIL), INSTITUTIONAL AND THIRD PARTY.

RETAIL DISTRIBUTION

AEFA'S LARGEST DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL IS ITS SALES FORCE OF FINANCIAL

ADVISORS. THROUGH THIS CHANNEL, AEFA OFFERS FINANCIAL PLANNING AND INVESTMENT

ADVISORY SERVICES (FOR WHICH IT CHARGES A FEE) TO INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESS

OWNERS THAT MAY ADDRESS SIX BASIC AREAS OF FINANCIAL PLANNING: FINANCIAL

POSITION, PROTECTION, INVESTMENT, INCOME TAX, RETIREMENT AND ESTATE PLANNING.

AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A BROAD

ARRAY OF PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

AEFA'S ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PROVIDES ADVISORS CHOICES IN HOW THEY

AFFILIATE WITH THE ORGANIZATION, WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF SERVICE, COMPENSATION

AND BRANDING. ADVISORS ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE AN EMPLOYEE ADVISOR PLATFORM, WITH

COMPENSATION BEING PAID AS A DRAW AGAINST COMMISSIONS, A HIGH LEVEL OF SUPPORT

AND A LOWER PAYOUT RATE; A BRANDED INDEPENDENT ADVISOR PLATFORM, STRUCTURED AS A

FRANCHISE SYSTEM, IN WHICH ADVISORS GET A HIGHER PAYOUT RATE AND CAN PURCHASE

THE SUPPORT SERVICES THEY PREFER; OR AN AFFILIATED BUT UNBRANDED BROKER-DEALER

PLATFORM WITH A YET HIGHER PAYOUT. THE UNBRANDED PLATFORM IS SECURITIES AMERICA,

INC., A BROKER-DEALER OWNED BY AEFC. SECURITIES AMERICA IS A DISTRIBUTOR OF

MUTUAL FUNDS, ANNUITIES AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES

AND WRAP PRODUCTS. SECURITIES AMERICA PROVIDED SERVICE TO 1,434 ADVISORS IN

2002.

APPROXIMATELY 24 PERCENT OF AEFA'S 11,600 FINANCIAL ADVISORS ARE AMERICAN

EXPRESS EMPLOYEES; ABOUT 64 PERCENT ARE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED FRANCHISEES;

AND ABOUT 12 PERCENT ARE IN THE UNBRANDED PLATFORM. AEFA BELIEVES IT IS THE ONLY

U.S. COMPANY TO OFFER ALL THREE OF THESE DIFFERENT CAREER TRACKS FOR ADVISORS,

WHICH IT CONSIDERS A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE. DURING 2002, AEFA TIGHTENED THE HIRING

CRITERIA FOR EMPLOYEE ADVISORS SO IT COULD MORE EFFECTIVELY SELECT APPLICANTS

WHO WOULD HAVE THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS. AT THE SAME TIME, AEFA

FOCUSED ON CLIENT ACQUISITION AND REDUCING COSTS IN ITS SYSTEM. AEFA FURTHER

IMPROVED THE SERVICE AND TOOLS PROVIDED TO FRANCHISEE ADVISORS AND FURTHER

ALIGNED METRICS AND COMPENSATION.

AEFA BELIEVES IT NEEDS TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF ITS

DEDICATED FIELD FORCE TO FURTHER ENHANCE ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND SERVE NEW

CLIENTS AND TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE LARGE SALES FORCES OF A FEW

COMPETITORS. IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING MEMBERS OF THE FIELD FORCE, AEFA

COMPETES WITH FINANCIAL PLANNING FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, SECURITIES

BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S GOAL OF LEVERAGING BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

ACROSS ALL OF ITS UNITS, AEFA CONTINUES TO INCREASE ITS SALES TO CUSTOMERS FROM

OTHER AMERICAN EXPRESS

PAGE 24

BUSINESSES. AEFA'S FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND PLANNING SERVICES (FEPS) GROUP

PROVIDES WORKPLACE FINANCIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVISOR

REFERRALS BETWEEN THE ADVISOR CHANNEL AND THE 401(K) CLIENT BASE OF AMERICAN

EXPRESS RETIREMENT SERVICES AND AMERICAN EXPRESS TRUST COMPANY. WITH

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT APPROVAL, ADVISORS PRESENT EDUCATIONAL SEMINARS IN THE

WORKPLACE TO EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED IN THE INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT'S

PROGRAM. IN 2002, AEFA ENHANCED THESE EDUCATIONAL AND REFERRAL ACTIVITIES WITH

401(K) CLIENTS REPRESENTING 250 COMPANIES AND OVER ONE MILLION PARTICIPANTS.

AEFA ALSO HAS FINANCIAL EDUCATION RELATIONSHIPS WITH 75 ADDITIONAL MAJOR U.S.

CORPORATIONS AND 500 SMALLER COMPANIES, ALSO REPRESENTING OVER ONE MILLION

EMPLOYEES. SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF AEFA'S NEW RETAIL CLIENTS IN 2002 CAME FROM THE

COMBINATION OF THESE INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS.

IN 2002, AEFA ALSO BEGAN TO LEVERAGE OTHER AMERICAN EXPRESS RELATIONSHIPS

WITH MAJOR COMPANIES TO CREATE ALLIANCES THAT HELP GENERATE NEW FINANCIAL

SERVICES CLIENTS. THE FIRST TEST OF THIS STRATEGY WAS A MARKETING ALLIANCE WITH

COSTCO, ONE OF THE LARGEST MERCHANTS IN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. THE

AEFA/COSTCO WHOLESALE PROGRAM GENERATES NEW ADVISOR CLIENTS FROM THE COSTCO

MEMBER BASE AT A LOWER ACQUISITION COST THAN TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, WHILE

PROVIDING COSTCO CUSTOMERS AN ARRAY OF MEMBER BENEFITS. AS A RESULT OF THE

INITIAL LAUNCH OF THE COSTCO ALLIANCE IN 2002, FIVE PERCENT OF AEFA'S NEW

CLIENTS CAME FROM THIS RELATIONSHIP AND 94 PERCENT OF ADVISOR CLIENTS OBTAINED

THROUGH THE COSTCO RELATIONSHIP COMPLETED A FINANCIAL PLAN.

AEFA ALSO HAS TAKEN STEPS TO INTEGRATE ITS DIRECT RETAIL DISTRIBUTION

CHANNEL WITH THE ADVISOR CHANNEL. AEFA'S ONLINE BROKERAGE BUSINESS, AMERICAN

EXPRESS BROKERAGE, ALLOWS CLIENTS TO PURCHASE AND SELL SECURITIES ONLINE, OBTAIN

RESEARCH AND INFORMATION ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF SECURITIES, USE ASSET

ALLOCATION AND FINANCIAL PLANNING TOOLS, CONTACT AN ADVISOR, AS WELL AS HAVE

ACCESS TO MORE THAN 3,000 PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS, AMONG

OTHER SERVICES.

THE INTERNET ALSO CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT AND COST EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR

ACQUIRING NEW CUSTOMERS. THE NUMBER OF ADVISOR LEADS GENERATED VIA THE INTERNET

INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2002, AT A SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED COST VERSUS

ALTERNATIVE CHANNELS. ADDITIONALLY, THE INTERNET HAS EMERGED AS A SIGNIFICANT

CHANNEL FOR SERVICE ON THE INSTITUTIONAL AND RETAIL SIDES OF THE BUSINESS.

IN 2002, AEFA LAUNCHED THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ONE'SM' FINANCIAL ACCOUNT, AN

INTEGRATED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT THAT COMBINES CLIENTS' INVESTMENT,

BANKING AND LENDING RELATIONSHIPS INTO A SINGLE ACCOUNT. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

ONE FINANCIAL ACCOUNT ENABLES CLIENTS TO ACCESS A SINGLE CASH ACCOUNT TO FUND A

VARIETY OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN MUTUAL FUNDS AND

OTHER SECURITIES. ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ONE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNT INCLUDE UNLIMITED CHECK WRITING WITH OVERDRAFT PROTECTION, AN AMERICAN

EXPRESS'R' GOLD CARD, ONLINE BILL PAYMENTS, ATM ACCESS AND A HIGH-YIELD SAVINGS

ACCOUNT. BY OFFERING CLIENTS THE BENEFITS OF "ONE-STOP SHOPPING," THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS ONE FINANCIAL ACCOUNT ENABLES AEFA TO ATTRACT A LARGER SHARE OF ITS

CLIENTS' ASSETS.

AEFA ALSO INTRODUCED AMERICAN EXPRESS PLATINUM FINANCIAL SERVICES'R' IN

2002 TO BETTER SERVE THE COMPANY'S MOST AFFLUENT CLIENTS. CLIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR

THIS OFFERING HAVE ACCESS TO CERTAIN SPECIALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND ARE

SERVED BY SPECIALLY TRAINED ADVISORS, MOST OF WHOM HOLD ADVANCED PLANNING

CERTIFICATIONS. IN 2002, AEFA TRAINED OVER 750 TOP ADVISORS TO PARTICIPATE IN

THE PROGRAM AND EXISTING CLIENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE PLATINUM FINANCIAL

SERVICES PROGRAM COMMITTED AN AVERAGE OF $150,000 IN NEW MONEY AS A RESULT.

PAGE 25

THE COMPANY ALSO ENGAGES IN THE BROKERAGE BUSINESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL SERVICES EUROPE LTD. ("AEFSE"). THIS BUSINESS

HAS TRANSFORMED INTO A MORE EXTENSIVE PROVIDER OF DIRECT INVESTMENT SERVICES,

AND NOW OFFERS, THROUGH A MULTI-CURRENCY ACCOUNT, CUSTOMER TRADING IN 11 STOCK

MARKETS, TAX WRAPPERS AND OVER 800 FUNDS. AEFSE IS PART OF THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL

BROKERAGE AND MEMBERSHIP B@NKING'R' ("GBMB") UNIT, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES THE

COMPANY'S U.S. BROKERAGE SERVICES OFFERED THROUGH AEFA AND MEMBERSHIP B@NKING

OFFERED THROUGH CENTURION BANK. GBMB IS HELPING TO COORDINATE THE EXPANSION OF

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS IN THE U.S. AND SELECT INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH AEFA AND TRS.

IN 2002, AEFA ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH MITSUI MUTUAL LIFE

INSURANCE COMPANY (MMLIC) TO LICENSE AEFA'S FINANCIAL PLANNING BUSINESS MODEL IN

JAPAN AND TRANSFER AEFA'S JAPANESE DIRECT MUTUAL FUND SALES BUSINESS. THE AEFA

ADVICE-BASED BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN TAILORED FOR JAPAN AND INCLUDES ADVISOR AND

LEADER TRAINING, MARKETING SUPPORT AND FINANCIAL PLANNING SOFTWARE. MMLIC

LAUNCHED ITS FINANCIAL PLANNING PERSONAL MONEY MANAGEMENT (PMM) SERVICE IN

NOVEMBER 2002. MMLIC HAS EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE MODEL THROUGH 2004. WITH THIS

STRATEGIC ALLIANCE, AEFA EXPECTS TO GAIN EXPERIENCE IN EXPORTING ADVICE

CAPABILITIES. AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION, AEFA CLOSED ITS RETAIL OPERATIONS

IN JAPAN.

INSTITUTIONAL

AMERICAN EXPRESS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP INC. ("AEAMG"), A SUBSIDIARY OF

AEFC AND AN SEC REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER, DIRECTLY OR THROUGH OPERATING

DIVISIONS OR SUBSIDIARIES, PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO.

O    PENSION, PROFIT-SHARING, EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND ENDOWMENT FUNDS OF

LARGE- AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENTAL UNITS AND OTHER LARGE

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS;

O    SMALLER ACCOUNTS OF WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL INSTITUTIONAL

CLIENTS, EITHER DIRECTLY TO SUCH CLIENTS OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH WRAP

PROGRAMS SPONSORED BY VARIOUS AFFILIATED AND UNAFFILIATED ENTITIES;

O    VARIOUS SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLES THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN SECURITIES AND

WHICH ARE BACKED BY HIGH-YIELD BONDS AND BANK LOANS (COLLATERALIZED

DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND SECURED LOAN TRUSTS); AND

O    VARIOUS HEDGE FUNDS STRUCTURED AS LIMITED LIABILITY ENTITIES AND

OFFSHORE CORPORATIONS.

FOR ITS INVESTMENT SERVICES, AEAMG GENERALLY RECEIVES FEES WHICH ARE

ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT. CLIENTS MAY ALSO PAY FEES TO AEAMG BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR

PORTFOLIO.

AEAMG OWNS A 50.1 PERCENT INTEREST IN KENWOOD CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC

("KENWOOD"), WHICH PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO INVESTMENT

COMPANIES, CORPORATIONS, TRUSTS, ESTATES, CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS AND TAX

QUALIFIED PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS. KENWOOD EMPLOYS AN ACTIVE INVESTMENT

STRATEGY THAT IS BASED ON A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO STOCK SELECTION AND

PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT, AND SEEKS TO ACHIEVE CONSISTENT EXCESS RETURNS

PAGE 26

RELATIVE TO PASSIVE INDEX BENCHMARKS FOR THE SMALL-CAP SEGMENT OF THE UNITED

STATES' EQUITY MARKET. AEAMG ALSO OWNS A 50.1 PERCENT INTEREST IN NORTHWINDS

MARKETING GROUP LLC ("NORTHWINDS"), A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER, WHICH MARKETS

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES OF AEAMG AND ITS AFFILIATED INVESTMENT ADVISERS,

AS WELL AS CERTAIN NON-AFFILIATED INVESTMENT ADVISERS, TO LARGE INSTITUTIONS,

PRIMARILY UNION AND PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS.

AEAMG ALSO PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO HEDGE FUNDS

STRUCTURED AS LIMITED LIABILITY ENTITIES AND OFFSHORE CORPORATIONS. AEAMG'S

DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES SERVE AS GENERAL MANAGER AND INVESTMENT MANAGER

OF SUCH ENTITIES. THESE SUBSIDIARIES ALSO SERVE AS COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS FOR

HEDGE FUNDS THAT TRADE IN FUTURES AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE REGISTERED WITH THE

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION ("CFTC") AND THE NATIONAL FUTURES

ASSOCIATION ("NFA"). OTHER ENTITIES AFFILIATED WITH AEAMG, WHICH ARE ALSO

SUBSIDIARIES OF AEFC, JOINTLY PROVIDE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY

SERVICES TO EUROPEAN EQUITY HEDGE FUNDS. AEAMG RECEIVES AN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

FEE, AND MAY ALSO RECEIVE A PERFORMANCE FEE, FOR THE SERVICES IT PROVIDES TO THE

HEDGE FUNDS. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND ANALYSTS FOR THE HEDGE FUNDS MAY, FROM TIME

TO TIME, INVEST THEIR OWN ASSETS IN THE FUNDS THEY MANAGE. INVESTORS IN THE

HEDGE FUNDS INCLUDE INSTITUTIONS, CORPORATIONS, PENSION PLANS, AND HIGH NET

WORTH INDIVIDUALS. INVESTORS MAY BE AFFILIATES OF AEFC. THE HEDGE FUND BUSINESS

FACED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN 2002 AND, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE ASSET LEVELS IN

THESE FUNDS DECLINED. THE BUSINESS FOCUSED ON REPOSITIONING FOR FUTURE GROWTH.

IN 2002, EIGHT NEW FUNDS (FOUR STRATEGIES) WERE LAUNCHED AND FOUR FUNDS (TWO

STRATEGIES) WERE CLOSED. PERSONNEL CHANGES WERE MADE, RESULTING IN A NET

INCREASE IN PERSONNEL DEDICATED TO THE HEDGE FUND BUSINESS.

AEAMG PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AS COLLATERAL MANAGER TO

VARIOUS SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLES THAT ISSUE SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY A

POOL OF ASSETS, I.E., COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS ("CDOS"). AEAMG ALSO

PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO SECURED LOAN TRUSTS ("SLTS"). AEAMG

IS ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, WHICH ADDRESSES

POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN ENTITIES, INCLUDING CDOS AND SLTS. AEAMG OR

ONE OR MORE OF ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES HAS INVESTED ITS OWN MONEY IN SUCH

VEHICLES, INCLUDING IN RESIDUAL EQUITY INTERESTS, WHICH ARE ILLIQUID AND THE

MOST SUBORDINATED (AND ACCORDINGLY, RISKIEST AND MOST VOLATILE) INTERESTS IN

SUCH VEHICLES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE CDO

RESIDUAL TRANCHES AND SLT NOTES WERE $28 MILLION AND $684 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE RETURN ON SUCH INVESTMENTS CORRELATES TO THE PERFORMANCE OF

PORTFOLIOS OF HIGH-YIELD BONDS AND BANK LOANS. GENERALLY, THE SLTS ARE

STRUCTURED SUCH THAT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE LOANS IN THE REFERENCE

PORTFOLIO TO WHICH THE SLTS CORRELATE MAY BE UP TO FIVE TIMES THAT OF THE PAR

AMOUNT OF THE NOTES HELD BY AEFA. DETERIORATION IN THE VALUE OF HIGH-YIELD

BONDS OR BANK LOANS WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN DETERIORATION OF INVESTMENT RETURN

ON THE RELEVANT CDO OR SLT, AS THE CASE MAY BE. IN THE EVENT OF SIGNIFICANT

DETERIORATION OF A PORTFOLIO, THE RELEVANT CDO OR SLT MAY BE SUBJECT TO EARLY

LIQUIDATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FURTHER DETERIORATION OF THE INVESTMENT

RETURN, OR IN SEVERE CASES, LOSS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT. DETERIORATION OF A

PORTFOLIO WOULD LIKELY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT FEES.

DURING 2001, AEFA PLACED A MAJORITY OF ITS RATED CDO SECURITIES AND

RELATED ACCRUED INTEREST, AS WELL AS A RELATIVELY MINOR AMOUNT OF OTHER LIQUID

SECURITIES, HAVING AN AGGREGATE BOOK VALUE OF $905 MILLION, INTO A

SECURITIZATION TRUST. IN RETURN, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $120 MILLION IN CASH

(EXCLUDING TRANSACTION EXPENSES) RELATING TO SALES TO UNAFFILIATED INVESTORS AND

RETAINED INTERESTS IN THE TRUST WITH ALLOCATED BOOK AMOUNTS AGGREGATING $785

MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE RETAINED INTERESTS HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF

$754 MILLION, OF WHICH $520 MILLION IS CONSIDERED INVESTMENT GRADE. THE COMPANY

HAS NO OBLIGATIONS, CONTINGENT OR OTHERWISE, TO SUCH UNAFFILIATED INVESTORS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AEAMG MANAGED SECURITIES PORTFOLIOS IN THE U.S.

TOTALING $14.8 BILLION COMPARED TO $18.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001.

INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES ARE OFFERED TO DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS AND MUTUAL FUNDS BY OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF

AEFC WHICH HAVE OFFICES IN

PAGE 27

LONDON, SINGAPORE AND TOKYO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THESE ENTITIES IN THE

AGGREGATE MANAGED $4.5 BILLION, OF WHICH $2.7 BILLION REPRESENTS MUTUAL FUND

ASSETS.

THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND

2002 WAS A CHALLENGING YEAR IN WHICH THERE WAS AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT. AEAMG AND ITS AFFILIATES MUST COMPETE AGAINST A SUBSTANTIAL

NUMBER OF LARGER FIRMS IN SEEKING TO ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT. COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCLUDE FEES, INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING THE QUALITY AND "TRACK RECORD" OF PORTFOLIO MANAGERS,

GLOBAL CAPABILITIES, RANGE OF PORTFOLIOS OFFERED AND CLIENT SERVICE.

AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT SERVICES ("AERS"), A BUSINESS UNIT OF AMERICAN

EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS INC., AND AMERICAN EXPRESS TRUST COMPANY ("AETC"),

TOGETHER PROVIDE RETIREMENT PLAN-RELATED SERVICES TO MID- TO LARGE-SIZE PRIVATE

EMPLOYERS, GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND UNIONS. TOGETHER, AERS AND AETC BUNDLE A

VARIETY OF SERVICE OFFERINGS FOR CLIENTS, INCLUDING A WIDE ARRAY OF INVESTMENT

OPTIONS, PARTICIPANT EDUCATION OFFERINGS, AND BOTH PHONE AND INTERNET-BASED PLAN

SERVICING. THE PRIMARY MARKET IS FOR RETIREMENT PLANS WITH AT LEAST $10 MILLION

IN ASSETS. AS NOTED IN GREATER DETAIL ABOVE, THE FEPS GROUP, WHICH IS A PART OF

THE AERS BUSINESS UNIT, PROVIDES WORKPLACE FINANCIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND AN

OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVISOR REFERRALS BETWEEN THE ADVISOR CHANNEL AND THE

INSTITUTIONAL CHANNEL, WHICH INCLUDES THE CLIENT BASE OF AERS AND AETC.

AETC IS A MINNESOTA CHARTERED, LIMITED SERVICE TRUST COMPANY WHICH

PRIMARILY PROVIDES TRUSTEE, CUSTODIAL, RECORD KEEPING, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT,

SECURITIES LENDING AND COMMON TRUST FUND SERVICES FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED

RETIREMENT PLANS, INCLUDING PENSION, PROFIT SHARING, 401(K) AND OTHER QUALIFIED

AND NON-QUALIFIED EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS. BASED UPON RECENTLY PUBLISHED

INDUSTRY FIGURES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY, THROUGH AERS AND AETC, IS A

LEADING EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED

STATES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AETC ACTED AS DIRECTED TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN OF 341

BENEFIT PLANS WHICH REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY $26.8 BILLION IN ASSETS MANAGED OR

ADMINISTERED, AND APPROXIMATELY 1.1 MILLION PARTICIPANTS. THIS INCLUDES

APPROXIMATELY $5.3 BILLION INVESTED IN PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS, $4.0 BILLION

INVESTED IN NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS, $11.5 BILLION ACTIVELY MANAGED BY

AETC THROUGH BOTH SEPARATE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS AND COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT

FUNDS, $5.9 BILLION OF ASSETS ADMINISTERED BY AETC, $69.1 MILLION INVESTED

THROUGH PARTICIPANT DIRECTED BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, AND $29.9 MILLION INVESTED IN

ANNUITIES.

FOR ITS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AETC RECEIVES FEES THAT ARE

GENERALLY BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT. AETC CLIENTS TYPICALLY DO NOT PAY FEES TO AETC BASED ON THE

PERFORMANCE OF THEIR PORTFOLIO. AEFA, THROUGH AERS, WILL ALSO RECEIVE REVENUES

BASED UPON SERVICING AGREEMENTS FROM BOTH THE PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY

MUTUAL FUNDS THAT ARE GENERALLY BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET VALUE OF

ASSETS INVESTED IN THE MUTUAL FUNDS, AND, IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, MAY ALSO

INCLUDE REVENUES ON A PER PARTICIPANT BASIS. WHILE AETC AND AERS MAY ALSO

RECEIVE FEES WHICH ARE ASSESSED AS A FLAT FEE OR ON A PER PARTICIPANT BASIS,

REVENUES ARE PRINCIPALLY BASED UPON THE VALUE OF ASSETS MANAGED OR ADMINISTERED,

WHICH MAY FLUCTUATE DUE TO MANY FACTORS, MOST NOTABLY DUE TO NET INFLOWS OR

OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS AND FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN THE EQUITY AND FIXED-INCOME MARKETS.

THROUGH ITS

PAGE 28

TRUSTEE AND CUSTODIAL SERVICES, AETC MAY ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE

SERVICES TO QUALIFIED EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS HOLDING EMPLOYER

STOCK.

THE BUSINESS CLIMATE FOR AERS AND AETC IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. AS WITH

AEAMG, AERS AND AETC EXPERIENCED A CHALLENGING YEAR IN 2002, REFLECTING AN

OVERALL DECLINE IN ASSETS BOTH MANAGED AND ADMINISTERED. AETC MUST COMPETE

AGAINST A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF LARGER FIRMS IN SEEKING TO ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCLUDE FEES,

RECORD KEEPING AND TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND CLIENT

SERVICING.

AETC IS PRIMARILY REGULATED BY THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

(BANKING DIVISION), AND IS SUBJECT TO NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER MINNESOTA

LAW. AETC MAY NOT ACCEPT DEPOSITS OR MAKE PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL LOANS. BECAUSE

AETC IS A SERVICE PROVIDER TO RETIREMENT PLANS, AETC IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

OVERSIGHT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY,

PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974

("ERISA").

AETC ALSO PROVIDES INSTITUTIONAL ASSET CUSTODIAL SERVICES TO AEFC AND THE

AEFA AFFILIATES PROVIDING MUTUAL FUNDS, INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES, ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND LIFE INSURANCE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AETC'S INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS

UNDER CUSTODY ARE APPROXIMATELY $102.2 BILLION. AETC CUSTODY REVENUES ARE

PRINCIPALLY BASED UPON THE VALUE OF ASSETS IN CUSTODY, WHICH MAY FLUCTUATE DUE

TO MANY FACTORS, MOST NOTABLY DUE TO NET INFLOWS OR OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS AND

FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN THE EQUITY AND FIXED-INCOME MARKETS.

THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION

IN ADDITION TO THE RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AEFA

CONTINUES TO EXPAND DISTRIBUTION BY DELIVERING PROPRIETARY INSURANCE AND ANNUITY

PRODUCTS THROUGH NON-AFFILIATED REPRESENTATIVES AND AGENTS OF THIRD-PARTY

DISTRIBUTORS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE OFFERED THROUGH AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE

INSURANCE COMPANY ("AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE") AND ITS AFFILIATE AMERICAN

CENTURION LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY ("AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE"), BOTH SUBSIDIARIES

OF IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("IDS LIFE"). AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE PROVIDES

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES TO SUPPORT THEIR RETAIL INSURANCE AND ANNUITY OPERATIONS. IT

DISTRIBUTES VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE AND FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACTS,

PRIMARILY THROUGH REGIONAL AND NATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND REGIONAL

AND/OR INDEPENDENT BROKER-DEALERS, IN ALL STATES EXCEPT NEW YORK AND NEW

HAMPSHIRE. AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE MARKETS FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITIES IN NEW

YORK.

DURING THE YEAR, AEFA CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS NETWORK OF THIRD-PARTY

DISTRIBUTORS THROUGH AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE AND AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE AND

ITS RANGE OF VARIABLE ANNUITY PRODUCTS OFFERED THROUGH THEM, RESULTING IN

STRONG THIRD-PARTY SALES EFFORTS. (AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE ALSO OFFERS ANNUITIES

DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS, GENERALLY PERSONS HOLDING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' CARD.)

AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE IMPROVED ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION DURING THE YEAR,

INCREASING MARKET SHARE, SUBSTANTIALLY ADDING TO ITS CLIENT BASE, AND FURTHER

BROADENING ITS VARIABLE ANNUITY PRODUCT LINEUP. AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE ALSO

EXPANDED AND STRENGTHENED ITS DISTRIBUTION AND TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY. AMERICAN

ENTERPRISE LIFE COMPETES DIRECTLY WITH SEVERAL OTHER INSURERS IN THE THIRD-PARTY

DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL.

PAGE 29

ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES

IN 2002, AEFA CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS SECURITIES BROKERAGE SERVICES.

AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INVESTMENT SERVICES INC. ("AEIS"), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY

OF AEFC, PROVIDES SECURITIES EXECUTION AND CLEARANCE SERVICES FOR APPROXIMATELY

963,000 RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS OF AEFA. AEIS HOLDS OVER $42 BILLION IN

ASSETS FOR CLIENTS. AEIS IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER WITH THE SEC, IS A

MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS, INC. ("NASD") AND THE

CHICAGO STOCK EXCHANGE AND IS REGISTERED WITH APPROPRIATE STATES.

AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS INC. ("AEFAI"), AEFC'S PRINCIPAL

MARKETING SUBSIDIARY, DOES BUSINESS AS A BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISOR IN

ALL 50 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND PUERTO RICO. AEFAI IS REGISTERED AS

A BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISOR REGULATED BY THE SEC AND IS A MEMBER OF

THE NASD. AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS MUST OBTAIN ALL REQUIRED STATE AND NASD

LICENSES.

AEFA ALSO ACTS AS CUSTODIAN AND BROKER FOR INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS,

TAX-SHELTERED CUSTODIAL ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RETIREMENT PLANS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND

SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THESE TAX-QUALIFIED

ASSETS EQUALED $63.6 BILLION, WHICH IS IN EXCESS OF 25% OF ALL INSTITUTIONAL AND

RETAIL ASSETS OWNED, MANAGED AND ADMINISTERED BY AEFA.

TO INCREASE ITS SERVICING FLEXIBILITY, SEVERAL AEFA PROCESSES WERE MIGRATED

UNDER THE GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION ("GIO") INITIATIVE AND ARE SERVICED

BY THREE SEPARATE VENDORS LOCATED IN THE PHILIPPINES AND INDIA. THESE SERVICE

CENTERS PROVIDE FRONT-END AEFA MUTUAL FUND AND BROKERAGE CALL CENTER SERVICES

AND A VARIETY OF BACK OFFICE SERVICES INCLUDING CASE MANAGEMENT AND PAY BY

PHONE. AEFA CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE STAFFING LEVELS WITHIN THE UNITED

STATES TO MEET GLOBAL UNCERTAINTIES AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS.

REGULATION

AEFA HAS EXPERIENCED, AND BELIEVES IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO,

INCREASED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF THE SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES INDUSTRIES AT

ALL LEVELS. IN 2002, THE SEC AND NASD HEIGHTENED APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS BY

ADOPTING SEVERAL NEW REGULATIONS, INCLUDING NEW BOOKS AND RECORDS RULES, NEW

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING RULES AND NEW BUSINESS CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS. AS A

PROVIDER OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS AND IRAS,

CERTAIN ASPECTS OF AEFA'S BUSINESS FALL WITHIN THE COMPLIANCE OVERSIGHT OF THE

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ("DOL") AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY

("TREASURY"), PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

APPLICABLE TO SUCH ACCOUNTS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE AND OTHER REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS ADDS TO THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF OPERATING AEFA'S BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION, THE SEC, DOL, TREASURY, SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS AND STATE

SECURITIES AND INSURANCE REGULATORS MAY CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS AND

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF

CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS OR SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A BROKER-DEALER OR AN

INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ITS OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS ALSO CAN

BRING COMPLAINTS AGAINST AEFA. MOREOVER, AEFA BELIEVES IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST

FINANCIAL

PAGE 30

INSTITUTIONS TO STRUCTURE ITSELF AS A FRANCHISE SYSTEM. AS SUCH, AEFA IS SUBJECT

TO FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND STATE FRANCHISE REQUIREMENTS.

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT

COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON COST,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, YIELD, CONVENIENCE, SERVICE, RELIABILITY, SAFETY,

INNOVATION, DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION. COMPETITION

IN THIS INDUSTRY IS VERY INTENSE. AEFA COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS BANKS, SECURITIES BROKERS, MUTUAL FUNDS AND INSURANCE

COMPANIES. SOME OF THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE LARGER, HAVE GREATER RESOURCES AND ARE

MORE GLOBAL THAN AEFA, AND THE CONTINUING TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION AND

GLOBALIZATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY MAY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

THESE STRONGER COMPETITORS. MANY OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALSO HAVE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT INCREASINGLY CROSS OVER THE TRADITIONAL LINES THAT

PREVIOUSLY DIFFERENTIATED ONE TYPE OF INSTITUTION FROM ANOTHER, THEREBY

HEIGHTENING COMPETITION FOR AEFA. THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

TO OFFER ONLINE INVESTMENT AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAS ALSO AFFECTED THE

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. REFLECTING THE OVERALL

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO SEEK

TO HIRE AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS.

AEFA'S BUSINESS DOES NOT, AS A WHOLE, EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATIONS.

INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES

LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES ARE IMPORTANT AEFA PRODUCTS. AEFA SELLS THESE

PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH IDS LIFE. A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AEFC, IDS LIFE

IS A STOCK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ORGANIZED UNDER MINNESOTA LAW.

IDS LIFE SERVES RESIDENTS OF ALL STATES EXCEPT NEW YORK AND DISTRIBUTES ITS

PRODUCTS EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH AEFA'S RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL. IDS LIFE ALSO

HAS FOUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES THAT DISTRIBUTE THEIR PRODUCTS THROUGH THE

VARIOUS AEFA DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK ("IDS

LIFE OF NEW YORK") SERVES NEW YORK RESIDENTS AND DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS

EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH THE RETAIL CHANNEL. AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE, AN INDIANA

CORPORATION, AND AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE, A NEW YORK CORPORATION, DISTRIBUTE

THEIR PRODUCTS THROUGH THE THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE"), AN ARIZONA

CORPORATION, DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THE DIRECT ACCESS CHANNEL OUTSIDE

OF NEW YORK. AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE ALSO DISTRIBUTES THROUGH THE DIRECT ACCESS

CHANNEL IN NEW YORK. IDS LIFE AND ITS FOUR INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES ARE

REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION AS THE "IDS LIFE COMPANIES."

BUSINESS SOLD THROUGH AEFA'S RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL FOR IDS LIFE AND

IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK REPRESENTS THE MAJORITY OF THE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY

BUSINESS FOR THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES. BUSINESS SOLD THROUGH THIRD PARTY

DISTRIBUTION FOR AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE AND AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE RANKS

SECOND. BUSINESS SOLD THROUGH THE DIRECT CHANNEL FOR AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE

AND AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE RANKS A DISTANT THIRD.

PAGE 31

REGULATION

IDS LIFE, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE AND AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE ARE SUBJECT

TO COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION BY THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (INSURANCE

DIVISION), THE INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, AND THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF

INSURANCE, RESPECTIVELY. AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ARE

REGULATED BY THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. THE LAWS OF THE OTHER

STATES IN WHICH THESE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS ALSO REGULATE SUCH MATTERS AS THE

LICENSING OF SALES PERSONNEL AND, IN SOME CASES, THE MARKETING AND CONTENTS OF

INSURANCE POLICIES AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF SUCH REGULATION

AND SUPERVISION IS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF MARKET CONDUCT PRACTICES OF INSURANCE COMPANIES,

INCLUDING SALES, MARKETING AND REPLACEMENTS OF LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES AND

"BONUS" ANNUITIES, HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS AND IS AFFECTING

THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPANIES APPROACH VARIOUS OPERATIONAL ISSUES, INCLUDING

COMPLIANCE. THE NUMBER OF PRIVATE LAWSUITS ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF LAWS IN

CONNECTION WITH INSURANCE AND ANNUITY MARKET CONDUCT HAS INCREASED. (SEE "LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS" BELOW.) VIRTUALLY ALL STATES MANDATE PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE

GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ASSESS INSURANCE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO FUND CLAIMS

OF CONTRACT OWNERS OF INSOLVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES.

ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL, THERE IS PERIODIC INTEREST IN ENACTING NEW

REGULATIONS RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING

TAXATION OF ANNUITIES AND LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES, AS

WELL AS THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF GENDER, WITH RESPECT TO

TERMS, CONDITIONS, RATES OR BENEFITS OF AN INSURANCE CONTRACT. NEW FEDERAL

REGULATION IN ANY OF THESE AREAS COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT UPON

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

AIMED AT PROMOTING TAX-ADVANTAGED SAVINGS THROUGH LIFETIME SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND

RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND THE DIVIDEND EXCLUSION PROPOSAL MAY ADVERSELY

IMPACT IDS LIFE COMPANIES' SALES OF ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS IF

ENACTED.

RATINGS

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES HAD CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 OF

APPROXIMATELY $60 BILLION, BASED ON GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES,

AND HAD TOTAL STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 OF $2.4

BILLION.

IDS LIFE RECEIVES RATINGS FROM INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES. GENERALLY, ITS

FOUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT RECEIVE AN INDIVIDUAL RATING, BUT RECEIVE THE

SAME RATING AS IDS LIFE. THESE AGENCIES EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS AND

CLAIMS-PAYING ABILITY OF INSURANCE COMPANIES BASED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

FACTORS. THE RATINGS REFLECT EACH AGENCY'S ESTIMATION OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES'

ABILITY TO MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS MAKING ANNUITY PAYOUTS AND

PAYING DEATH BENEFITS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE CONTRACTS. AS SUCH, THE

RATINGS RELATE TO THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' GENERAL ACCOUNTS AND NOT TO THE

VARIABLE ACCOUNTS. THIS INFORMATION GENERALLY DOES NOT RELATE TO THE MANAGEMENT

OR PERFORMANCE OF THE VARIABLE SUBACCOUNTS OF THE CONTRACTS.

PAGE 32

RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO MAINTAINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES. LOWERING OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' RATINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THEIR ABILITY TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS AND COULD LEAD TO

INCREASED SURRENDERS OF THEIR PRODUCTS. RATING AGENCIES CONTINUALLY REVIEW

THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CONDITION OF INSURERS. AS OF THE END OF 2002, IDS

LIFE WAS RATED "A+" (SUPERIOR) BY A.M. BEST COMPANY, INC. AND ITS CLAIMS-PAYING

ABILITY/FINANCIAL STRENGTH WAS RATED "AA3" (EXCELLENT) BY MOODY'S INVESTORS

SERVICE, INC. (MOODY'S), AND "AA" (VERY STRONG) BY FITCH. IN LIGHT OF THE

COMPANY'S DESIRE TO MAINTAIN THESE RATINGS, IDS LIFE'S PARENT CONTRIBUTED $400

MILLION OF CAPITAL TO IDS LIFE IN 2002.

THE FOREGOING RATINGS REFLECT EACH RATING AGENCY'S OPINION OF THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' FINANCIAL STRENGTH, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY TO MEET ITS

OBLIGATIONS TO CONTRACT OWNERS. SUCH FACTORS ARE OF PRIMARY CONCERN TO CONTRACT

OWNERS, AGENTS AND INTERMEDIARIES, BUT ALSO MAY BE OF INTEREST TO INVESTORS.

RISK BASED CAPITAL

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS ("NAIC") ADOPTED RISK

BASED CAPITAL ("RBC") REQUIREMENTS FOR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE RBC

REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BE USED AS MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THE NAIC AND

STATES TO IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MERIT FURTHER REGULATORY ACTION. AT DECEMBER

31, 2002, IDS LIFE HAD TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY $2.6 BILLION.

AS DEFINED BY THE NAIC, TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL INCLUDES CERTAIN ASSET VALUATION

RESERVES EXCLUDED FROM THE $2.4 BILLION OF STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS

REFERRED TO ABOVE. THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, IDS LIFE'S INSURANCE

REGULATOR, REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM RBC CALLED THE

"AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL." IF TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL FELL BELOW THE

AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL, THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WOULD BE

AUTHORIZED TO EXERCISE MANAGEMENT CONTROL OVER IDS LIFE. FOR IDS LIFE,

AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL CAPITAL WAS $435 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

IN ADDITION, INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN HIGHER CAPITAL

AT A LEVEL ABOVE THAT WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A COMPANY TO FILE AN ACTION PLAN WITH

THE DEPARTMENT. THIS IS REFERRED TO AS THE "COMPANY ACTION LEVEL." FOR IDS LIFE,

COMPANY ACTION LEVEL CAPITAL WAS $870 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IDS LIFE MAINTAINS LEVELS OF RBC FAR IN EXCESS OF THE

AUTHORIZED CONTROL AND COMPANY ACTION LEVELS REQUIRED BY THE MINNESOTA

DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL MAINTAINED IN IDS LIFE IS THOUGHT

TO BE APPROPRIATE BY MANAGEMENT AND IS MORE COMMENSURATE WITH STANDARDS

NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN IDS LIFE'S RATINGS WITH THE VARIOUS CREDIT AND

CLAIMS-PAYING RATING AGENCIES.

THE GENERAL ACCOUNT

ASSETS SUPPORTING CONTRACT VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH FIXED ACCOUNT LIFE

INSURANCE AND ANNUITY PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH FIXED ACCOUNT

OPTIONS UNDER VARIABLE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY PRODUCTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE

"FIXED ACCOUNTS"), ARE PART OF AN INSURER'S "GENERAL ACCOUNT." UNDER FIXED

ACCOUNTS, THE INSURER BEARS THE INVESTMENT RISK. IN INVESTING THEIR GENERAL

ACCOUNT ASSETS, IDS LIFE COMPANIES SEEK TO MAINTAIN A DEPENDABLE AND TARGETED

PAGE 33

DIFFERENCE OR "SPREAD" BETWEEN THE INTEREST RATE EARNED ON GENERAL ACCOUNT

ASSETS AND THE INTEREST RATE THE INSURER CREDITS TO CONTRACT OWNERS' FIXED

ACCOUNTS. THIS SPREAD IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF NET INCOME FOR THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES.

THE GENERAL ACCOUNT ASSETS ALSO INCLUDE FUNDS ACCUMULATED THROUGH INSURANCE

PREMIUMS AND COST OF INSURANCE CHARGES. THESE PREMIUMS AND CHARGES ARE MAJOR

SOURCES OF REVENUE FOR IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK.

IN THE GENERAL ACCOUNT, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES PRIMARILY INVEST IN FIXED

INCOME SECURITIES OVER A BROAD RANGE OF MATURITIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING

A TARGETED RATE OF RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENTS WHILE CONTROLLING RISK. THE

MAJORITY OF THESE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE INTEREST BEARING INVESTMENTS SUCH

AS GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, MORTGAGE BACKED OBLIGATIONS AND VARIOUS CORPORATE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES DO NOT INVEST IN SECURITIES TO GENERATE

TRADING PROFITS.

EACH OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES HAS AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE THAT MEETS

PERIODICALLY TO REVIEW MODELS PROJECTING DIFFERENT INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS,

RISK/RETURN MEASURES, AND THEIR EFFECT ON PROFITABILITY. THE COMMITTEE ALSO

REVIEWS THE DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO BY TYPE AND CREDIT RISK

SECTOR. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE COMMITTEE IS TO STRUCTURE THE INVESTMENT SECURITY

PORTFOLIO BASED UPON THE TYPE AND EXPECTED BEHAVIOR OF PRODUCTS IN THE

LIABILITY PORTFOLIO SO AS TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ACHIEVE TARGETED

LEVELS OF PROFITABILITY WITHIN DEFINED RISK PARAMETERS.

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES HAVE THE DISCRETION TO SET THE RATE OF INTEREST

CREDITED TO CONTRACT OWNERS' ACCOUNTS. HOWEVER, THIS DISCRETION IS LIMITED BY

THE CONTRACT'S GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST RATE. THIS RATE VARIES AMONG FIXED

ACCOUNTS AND IS AS LOW AS 3% AND AS HIGH AS 5%. (APPROXIMATELY TEN STATES HAVE

ADOPTED REGULATIONS PROVIDING FOR A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST RATE THAT IS

LESS THAN 3%. IN SOME STATES IT IS AS LOW AS 1.5%; IN OTHER STATES IT IS TIED

TO AN INDEX. THE NAIC RECENTLY ADOPTED A MODEL REGULATION PROVIDING FOR AN

INDEXED GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST RATE, AND IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT A NUMBER

OF STATES WILL FOLLOW THIS MODEL.) THE INTEREST RATES CREDITED TO CONTRACT

OWNERS' FIXED ACCOUNTS ARE GENERALLY RESET AT SHORTER INTERVALS THAN THE

MATURITY OF UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. THEREFORE, MARGINS MAY BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY INCREASES IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES. PART OF THE

INVESTMENT COMMITTEE'S STRATEGY INCLUDES THE USE OF DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS

INTEREST RATE CAPS, SWAPS AND FLOORS, FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THESE

DERIVATIVES HELP PROTECT MARGINS BY INCREASING INVESTMENT RETURNS IF THERE IS

A SUDDEN AND SEVERE RISE IN INTEREST RATES, THEREBY MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF

AN INCREASE IN RATES CREDITED TO CONTRACT OWNERS' FIXED ACCOUNTS. CONVERSELY,

IN A LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS THAT EXPERIENCED RECENTLY, MARGINS

MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS THE INTEREST RATES AVAILABLE ON THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' INVESTED ASSETS APPROACH GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST RATES ON THE

INSURANCE OR ANNUITY CONTRACTS. THIS NEGATIVE IMPACT MAY BE COMPOUNDED BY THE

FACT THAT MANY OF THESE INTEREST BEARING INVESTMENTS ARE CALLABLE OR

PREPAYABLE BY THE ISSUER AND CALLS AND PREPAYMENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN

A LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES SOLD APPROXIMATELY $10.5 BILLION OF THEIR INVESTED

ASSETS DURING THE YEAR, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY $3

BILLION IN ASSETS WERE REDEEMED DURING THE YEAR. THE CASH GENERATED BY THESE

SALES AND REDEMPTIONS HAS BEEN OR WILL BE INVESTED.

PAGE 34

THE VARIABLE ACCOUNTS

VARIABLE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY PRODUCTS OFFER VARIABLE ACCOUNT INVESTMENT

OPTIONS IN ADDITION TO THE FIXED ACCOUNT OPTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. UNDER VARIABLE

ACCOUNTS, CONTRACT OWNERS BEAR THE INVESTMENT RISK. THE VARIABLE ACCOUNTS ARE

REGISTERED AS UNIT INVESTMENT TRUSTS UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940.

GENERALLY, THE VARIABLE ACCOUNTS CONSIST OF A NUMBER OF SUBACCOUNTS, EACH OF

WHICH INVESTS IN SHARES OF A PARTICULAR FUND.

CONTRACT OWNERS CAN ALLOCATE THEIR PAYMENTS AMONG VARIABLE SUBACCOUNTS THAT

INVEST IN UNDERLYING FUNDS. THE UNDERLYING FUNDS ARE MANAGED BOTH BY INTERNAL

AND THIRD-PARTY MONEY MANAGERS. INTERNALLY MANAGED FUNDS FOR THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' VARIABLE ANNUITIES INCLUDE THE 19 AXP'R' VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS.

INTERNALLY MANAGED FUNDS FOR THE VARIABLE LIFE BUSINESS INCLUDE THE AXP VARIABLE

PORTFOLIO FUNDS AND THE SEVEN IDS LIFE SERIES FUND PORTFOLIOS. THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES ALSO OFFER FUNDS MANAGED BY

THIRD-PARTY MONEY MANAGERS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS UNDER THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT ADVISOR ADVANTAGE'R' VARIABLE ANNUITY AND THE

WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, LLC. THESE FUNDS INVEST IN PORTFOLIOS CONTAINING A

VARIETY OF SECURITIES INCLUDING COMMON STOCKS, BONDS, MANAGED ASSETS AND/OR

SHORT-TERM SECURITIES. THE VALUE OF THESE SUBACCOUNTS FLUCTUATES WITH THE

INVESTMENT RETURN OF THE FUNDS IN WHICH THE SUBACCOUNTS INVEST. THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' MAJOR SOURCE OF REVENUE FROM THE VARIABLE PRODUCTS IS THE FEES IT

RECEIVES. THESE FEES MAY INCLUDE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES FROM UNDERLYING

INTERNALLY MANAGED FUNDS, REVENUES FROM UNDERLYING OUTSIDE-MANAGED FUNDS AND

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK FEES FROM VARIABLE SUBACCOUNTS.

VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES ARE "SEPARATE ACCOUNT" RATHER THAN

GENERAL ACCOUNT PRODUCTS. THIS MEANS THAT STATE INSURANCE LAW PROHIBITS CHARGING

VARIABLE ACCOUNTS WITH LIABILITIES OF THE GENERAL BUSINESS. UNDER THE

SUBACCOUNTS OF EACH VARIABLE ACCOUNT, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES CREDIT OR CHARGE

INCOME, CAPITAL GAINS AND CAPITAL LOSSES ONLY TO THAT SUBACCOUNT.

INSURANCE: PRODUCT FEATURES AND RISKS

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES ISSUE A WIDE RANGE OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS INCLUDING

VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE, UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE, TRADITIONAL WHOLE LIFE AND

TERM LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS, LONG-

PAGE 35

TERM CARE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES HAVE

NO SHORT-DURATION LIFE INSURANCE LIABILITIES. THE COMPANIES ISSUE ONLY

NON-PARTICIPATING CONTRACTS. IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY AND AMEX

ASSURANCE COMPANY (COLLECTIVELY, "IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY") OFFER PERSONAL AUTO

AND HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE.

VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE. IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S BIGGEST

SELLING LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. RETAIL

ADVISORS OF AEFA SELL PRIMARILY IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S VARIABLE

LIFE INSURANCE. VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE PROVIDES LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE ALONG

WITH INVESTMENT RETURNS LINKED TO THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS THE POLICYHOLDER

CHOOSES. THESE PRODUCTS ALSO OFFER A FIXED ACCOUNT WITH A GUARANTEED MINIMUM

INTEREST RATE OF 4% OR 4.5%. IDS LIFE RANKED FOURTH IN VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE

SALES IN 2002. BEGINNING IN 1999 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE

OF NEW YORK REINSURED 80% OF THE MORTALITY RISK ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW SALES OF

INDIVIDUAL FLEXIBLE PREMIUM VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE. THIS MEANS THAT ON THESE

MORE RECENT PRODUCT SALES, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ARE AT RISK FOR

ONLY 20% OF EACH POLICY'S DEATH BENEFIT FROM THE FIRST DOLLAR OF COVERAGE. IN

CONTRAST AND PRIOR TO THIS ARRANGEMENT, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK

GENERALLY RETAINED RISK UP TO $750,000 ON EACH INSURED LIFE AND REINSURED ONLY

AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF $750,000. GENERALLY, THE PRIOR ARRANGEMENT LEFT IDS LIFE

AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK WITH MORE OF THE RISK FOR THE DEATH BENEFIT THAN THE

MORE RECENT PRACTICE. BEGINNING IN LATE 2002, IDS LIFE BEGAN REINSURING 90%

OF THE MORTALITY RISK ON NEW SALES OF INDIVIDUAL FLEXIBLE PREMIUM VARIABLE LIFE

AND FIXED UNIVERSAL LIFE.

IDS LIFE'S VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS INCLUDE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R'

VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE IV/VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE IV - ESTATE SERIES WHICH ARE

INDIVIDUAL FLEXIBLE PREMIUM POLICIES. THE ESTATE SERIES POLICY IS AVAILABLE TO

POLICYHOLDERS WITH INITIAL SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF $1 MILLION OR MORE. THESE

POLICIES WERE INTRODUCED IN DECEMBER 2002. IDS LIFE ALSO ISSUES AMERICAN EXPRESS

SUCCESSION SELECT, A FLEXIBLE PREMIUM SURVIVORSHIP POLICY THAT INSURES TWO

LIVES. SUCCESSION SELECT IS OFTEN USED FOR ESTATE PLANNING PURPOSES. FINALLY,

IDS LIFE ISSUES AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' SINGLE PREMIUM VARIABLE LIFE, AN INDIVIDUAL

SINGLE PREMIUM VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY.

UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE. IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S UNIVERSAL

LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS PROVIDE LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND CASH VALUE THAT

INCREASES BY A FIXED INTEREST RATE. THE RATE IS PERIODICALLY RESET ACCORDING TO

THE TERMS OF THE POLICY AT THE DISCRETION OF THE ISSUING COMPANY. POLICIES

ISSUED BY IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ALSO PROVIDE A GUARANTEED MINIMUM

INTEREST RATE, GENERALLY 4% OR 4.5%, AND A FEW AS HIGH AS 5%.

IDS LIFE'S UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS INCLUDE LIFE PROTECTION PLUS,

LIFE PROTECTION - SELECT AND LIFE PROTECTION SELECT'SM' - ESTATE SERIES. THE

ESTATE SERIES POLICY IS AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH INITIAL SPECIFIED

AMOUNTS OF $1 MILLION OR MORE.

TRADITIONAL LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS. IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S

TRADITIONAL LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS INCLUDE WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE AND TERM LIFE

INSURANCE. WHOLE

PAGE 36

LIFE INSURANCE COMBINES A DEATH BENEFIT WITH A CASH VALUE THAT GENERALLY

INCREASES GRADUALLY IN AMOUNT OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS AND DOES NOT PAY A

DIVIDEND. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK HAVE SOLD VERY LITTLE TRADITIONAL

WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE IN RECENT YEARS. TERM LIFE INSURANCE PROVIDES ONLY A DEATH

BENEFIT, DOES NOT BUILD UP CASH VALUE AND DOES NOT PAY A DIVIDEND. THE

POLICYHOLDER CHOOSES THE TERM OF COVERAGE AT THE TIME OF ISSUE. DURING THE

CHOSEN TERM, THE COMPANY CANNOT RAISE PREMIUM RATES EVEN IF CLAIMS EXPERIENCE

WERE TO DETERIORATE. BEGINNING IN 2001 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, IDS LIFE AND IDS

LIFE OF NEW YORK HAVE REINSURED 90% OF THE MORTALITY RISK ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW

TERM INSURANCE SALES. THIS MEANS THAT ON THESE MORE RECENT PRODUCT SALES, IDS

LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ARE AT RISK FOR ONLY 10% OF EACH POLICY'S

DEATH BENEFIT FROM THE FIRST DOLLAR OF COVERAGE. IN CONTRAST AND PRIOR TO THIS

ARRANGEMENT, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK GENERALLY RETAINED RISK UP TO

$750,000 ON EACH INSURED LIFE AND REINSURED ONLY AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF $750,000.

GENERALLY, THE PRIOR ARRANGEMENT LEFT IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK WITH

MORE OF THE RISK FOR THE DEATH BENEFIT THAN THE MORE RECENT PRACTICE.

LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ENTERED THE

INDIVIDUAL LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE ("LTC") MARKET IN 1989 AND BELIEVE THEY HAVE

A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN THIS MARKET. IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S

LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE PRODUCTS PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR DOCUMENTED NURSING HOME,

ASSISTED LIVING OR HOME OR HEALTH CARE EXPENSES. THESE PRODUCTS WERE SOLD ON A

GUARANTEED RENEWABLE BASIS, WHEREBY THE OWNERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO RENEW THE

POLICIES EACH YEAR AS LONG AS PREMIUMS ARE PAID, BUT THE COMPANIES HAVE THE

RIGHT TO INCREASE PREMIUM RATES ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS.

IN RECENT YEARS, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK HAVE EXPERIENCED GREATER

THAN EXPECTED CLAIMS AND LOWER THAN EXPECTED LAPSE RATES WITH RESPECT TO ITS LTC

BLOCK. TO RESPOND TO THIS TREND, THE COMPANIES HAVE PURSUED AND ARE PURSUING

MANY COURSES OF ACTION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW

YORK HAVE DISCONTINUED UNDERWRITING LTC INSURANCE. RETAIL ADVISORS OF AEFA WILL

NOW SELL ONLY NON-PROPRIETARY LTC PRODUCTS OFFERED BY GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL

ASSURANCE COMPANY ("GECA"). IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ARE ALSO EXPECTING

TO OUTSOURCE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION IN MAY 2003 TO GECA.

DISABILITY INCOME. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ALSO ISSUE DISABILITY

INCOME ("DI") INSURANCE. DI INSURANCE PROVIDES MONTHLY BENEFITS TO INDIVIDUALS

WHO ARE UNABLE TO EARN INCOME AT EITHER THEIR OCCUPATION AT TIME OF DISABILITY

("OWN OCCUPATION") OR AT ANY SUITABLE OCCUPATION ("ANY OCCUPATION"). DEPENDING

UPON OCCUPATIONAL AND MEDICAL UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, APPLICANTS FOR DI INSURANCE

CAN CHOOSE "OWN OCCUPATION" AND "ANY OCCUPATION" COVERAGE FOR VARYING BENEFIT

PERIODS UP TO AGE 65. APPLICANTS MAY ALSO CHOOSE VARIOUS BENEFIT RIDERS TO HELP

THEM INTEGRATE INDIVIDUAL DI BENEFITS WITH SOCIAL SECURITY OR SIMILAR BENEFIT

PLANS AND TO HELP THEM PROTECT THEIR DI BENEFITS FROM THE RISK OF INFLATION. IDS

LIFE BELIEVES IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN THE DI MARKET.

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE. IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED

SUBSIDIARY, AMEX ASSURANCE COMPANY, PROVIDE PERSONAL AUTO AND HOMEOWNER'S

COVERAGE TO CLIENTS IN 37 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. IDS PROPERTY

CASUALTY IS REGULATED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE FOR WISCONSIN. AMEX

ASSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH ALSO PROVIDES CERTAIN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD RELATED

INSURANCE PRODUCTS, IS REGULATED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE FOR ILLINOIS.

IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY MARKETS THROUGH ALLIANCES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND

DIRECT TO AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS. IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY HAS A MAJOR

DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

PAGE 37

WITH COSTCO'S AFFILIATED INSURANCE AGENCY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THIS

ARRANGEMENT OFFERED IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY'S AUTO INSURANCE IN 30 STATES AND

HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE IN 29 STATES TO COSTCO MEMBERS.

INSURANCE RISKS. IDS LIFE'S SALES OF INDIVIDUAL LIFE INSURANCE IN 2002, AS

MEASURED BY SCHEDULED ANNUAL PREMIUMS AND EXCLUDING LUMP SUM PREMIUMS, CONSISTED

OF 82% VARIABLE LIFE, 8% UNIVERSAL LIFE AND 10% TERM LIFE.

THE INSURANCE BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND COMPETITORS CONSIST OF

BOTH STOCK AND MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANIES. COMPETITIVE FACTORS APPLICABLE TO THE

INSURANCE BUSINESS INCLUDE PRODUCT FEATURES, THE INTEREST RATES CREDITED TO

PRODUCTS, THE CHARGES DEDUCTED FROM THE CASH VALUES OF SUCH PRODUCTS, INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE, THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE ORGANIZATION, DISTRIBUTION AND

MANAGEMENT EXPENSES, CLAIMS PAYING RATINGS AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO

POLICYHOLDERS.

FOR LONG-TERM PROFITABILITY, IT IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PRICING TO

COVER INSURANCE RISKS AND TO ACCUMULATE ADEQUATE RESERVES. RESERVES ARE A

MEASURE OF THE ASSETS THAT THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES ESTIMATE ARE NEEDED NOW TO

ADEQUATELY PROVIDE FOR FUTURE BENEFITS AND EXPENSES.

ANNUITIES: PRODUCT FEATURES AND RISKS

IDS LIFE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OFFER VARIABLE AND FIXED ANNUITIES, IMMEDIATE

AND DEFERRED, TO A BROAD RANGE OF CONSUMERS THROUGH MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS. RETAIL ADVISORS OF AEFA CAN OFFER ONLY IDS LIFE OR IDS LIFE OF NEW

YORK VARIABLE AND FIXED ANNUITIES AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, VARIABLE AND

FIXED ANNUITIES OFFERED BY AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE. RETAIL ADVISORS DO NOT

OFFER ANNUITY PRODUCTS OF AEFA'S COMPETITORS. ANNUITIES MAY BE DEFERRED, WHERE

ASSETS ACCUMULATE UNTIL THE CONTRACT IS SURRENDERED, THE CONTRACT OWNER DIES, OR

THE CONTRACT OWNER BEGINS RECEIVING BENEFITS UNDER AN ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTION; OR

IMMEDIATE, WHERE PAYMENTS BEGIN WITHIN ONE YEAR OF ISSUE AND CONTINUE FOR LIFE

OR FOR A FIXED PERIOD ONLY.

IDS LIFE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST ISSUERS OF ANNUITIES IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2002, IDS LIFE, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, RANKED ELEVENTH AMONG THE TOP

ANNUITY WRITERS. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES POSTED ANNUITY SALES IN 2002 OF OVER

$7.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 60% ACROSS ALL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

VARIABLE ANNUITIES. LIKE VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE, VARIABLE ANNUITIES

PROVIDE CONTRACT OWNERS WITH INVESTMENT RETURNS LINKED TO THE UNDERLYING

INVESTMENTS THE CONTRACT OWNER CHOOSES. THESE PRODUCTS ALSO OFFER A FIXED

ACCOUNT WITH A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST RATE OF 3% TO 4%. ONE OF IDS LIFE'S

VARIABLE ANNUITIES, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT ADVISOR ADVANTAGE'R'

VARIABLE ANNUITY WAS THE FOURTH LARGEST-SELLING ANNUITY IN THE COUNTRY IN 2002.

FIXED ANNUITIES. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' FIXED ANNUITIES PROVIDE CASH VALUE

THAT INCREASES BY A FIXED INTEREST RATE. THE RATE IS PERIODICALLY RESET

ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AT THE DISCRETION OF THE ISSUER. THE

CONTRACTS PROVIDE A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST RATE, GENERALLY 3% TO 4%.

PAGE 38

ANNUITY RISKS. THE RELATIVE PROPORTION BETWEEN FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITIES

SALES IS GENERALLY DRIVEN BY THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE EQUITY AND FIXED

INCOME MARKETS. IN TIMES OF LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE IN EQUITY MARKETS, FIXED

SALES ARE GENERALLY STRONGER. IN TIMES OF SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE IN EQUITY

MARKETS, VARIABLE SALES ARE GENERALLY STRONGER. IN ADDITION, INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE IS CRITICAL TO THE PROFITABILITY OF AN ANNUITY BUSINESS.

IN PAST YEARS, INNOVATIVE FEATURES FOR ANNUITY PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN

CONTINUALLY EVOLVING. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE MINIMUM DEATH BENEFIT GUARANTEES

THAT PROTECT BENEFICIARIES FROM A DROP IN DEATH BENEFITS DUE TO PERFORMANCE OF

THE RELATED UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. IDS LIFE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ISSUE ANNUITY

CONTRACTS WITH A VARIETY OF GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFIT FEATURES. THESE

GUARANTEES ARE SUPPORTED BY GENERAL ACCOUNT ASSETS. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES'

EXPOSURE TO RISK FROM THESE GUARANTEES WILL GENERALLY INCREASE WHEN EQUITY

MARKETS DECLINE.

THE STANDARD GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFIT IN THE CURRENT "FLAGSHIP"

ANNUITY OFFERED BY IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK, AMERICAN EXPRESS

RETIREMENT ADVISOR ADVANTAGE VARIABLE ANNUITY, PROVIDES THAT IF THE CONTRACT

OWNER AND ANNUITANT ARE AGE 80 OR YOUNGER ON THE DATE OF DEATH, THE BENEFICIARY

WILL RECEIVE THE GREATEST OF (I) THE CONTRACT VALUE, (II) PURCHASE PAYMENTS

MINUS ADJUSTED PARTIAL SURRENDERS, OR (III) THE CONTRACT VALUE AS OF THE MOST

RECENT SIXTH CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY, PLUS PURCHASE PAYMENTS AND MINUS ADJUSTED

PARTIAL SURRENDERS SINCE THAT ANNIVERSARY.

FOR ADDITIONAL PROTECTION, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK CONTRACT

OWNERS MAY PURCHASE A MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE DEATH BENEFIT. IDS LIFE CONTRACT

OWNERS ALSO MAY PURCHASE AN ENHANCED EARNINGS DEATH BENEFIT AND AN ENHANCED

EARNINGS PLUS DEATH BENEFIT. THESE ARE OPTIONAL BENEFITS AVAILABLE FOR AN

ADDITIONAL CHARGE. THE MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE DEATH BENEFIT GUARANTEES THAT

THE DEATH BENEFIT WILL NOT BE LESS THAN THE HIGHEST CONTRACT VALUE ACHIEVED ON A

CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY BEFORE THE CONTRACT HOLDER REACHES THE AGE OF 81, ADJUSTED

FOR PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS. THE ENHANCED EARNINGS DEATH BENEFIT RIDERS ARE INTENDED

TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TO A BENEFICIARY TO OFFSET EXPENSES AFTER THE

CONTRACT OWNER'S DEATH. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK BEAR THE RISK THAT

PROTRACTED UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD RESULT IN GUARANTEED

MINIMUM DEATH BENEFITS BEING HIGHER THAN WHAT ACCUMULATED CONTRACT OWNER ACCOUNT

BALANCES WOULD SUPPORT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ULTIMATE ACTUAL

EXPERIENCE WILL NOT DIFFER FROM IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S ESTIMATES.

AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF IDS LIFE ALSO OFFER

VARIABLE ANNUITIES WITH A VARIETY OF GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFIT FEATURES

AND CERTAIN OPTIONAL BENEFITS.

TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFIT IS HIGHER THAN THE

CURRENT ACCOUNT VALUE AT THE TIME OF DEATH, A COST IS INCURRED BY THE ISSUER OF

THE POLICY. CURRENT ACCOUNTING LITERATURE DOES NOT PRESCRIBE ADVANCE RECOGNITION

OF THE PROJECTED FUTURE NET COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GUARANTEES, AND

ACCORDINGLY, IDS LIFE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CURRENTLY DO NOT RECORD A LIABILITY

CORRESPONDING TO THESE FUTURE OBLIGATIONS FOR DEATH BENEFITS IN EXCESS OF

ANNUITY ACCOUNT VALUE. AT PRESENT, THE AMOUNT PAID IN EXCESS OF CONTRACT VALUE

IS EXPENSED WHEN PAYABLE. AMOUNTS EXPENSED IN 2002 AND 2001 WERE $37 MILLION AND

$16 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A PROPOSED AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION, "ACCOUNTING

AND REPORTING BY INSURANCE ENTERPRISES FOR CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION

CONTRACTS AND FOR SEPARATE ACCOUNTS" (THE "PROPOSED SOP"), WOULD REQUIRE THE

RECORDING OF A LIABILITY FOR THE EXPECTED NET

PAGE 39

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GUARANTEES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, IF ADOPTED

AS PROPOSED. THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED SOP IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED.

INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES: LIABILITIES AND RESERVES

INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND RESERVES. THE LIABILITIES FOR REPORTED AND UNPAID

LIFE INSURANCE CLAIMS ARE EQUAL TO THE DEATH BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER THE

POLICIES. FOR DI AND LTC CLAIMS, UNPAID CLAIM LIABILITIES ARE EQUAL TO BENEFIT

AMOUNTS DUE AND ACCRUED. FOR LIFE, DI, AND LTC, LIABILITIES FOR INCURRED BUT NOT

REPORTED CLAIMS ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON PERIODIC ANALYSIS OF THE ACTUAL REPORTED

HISTORICAL CLAIM LAG. WHERE APPLICABLE, AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS

(I.E., OTHER INSURERS WHO SHARE IN THE RISK OF THE PRODUCTS THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' OFFER) ARE SEPARATELY RECORDED AS RECEIVABLES.

THE CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR DI AND LTC ARE BASED ON THE CLAIM

RESERVES. THESE RESERVES REPRESENT THE EXPENSE OF REVIEWING CLAIMS AND MAKING

BENEFIT PAYMENT DETERMINATIONS. FOR LIFE INSURANCE, NO CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

RESERVE IS HELD.

POLICY LIABILITIES FOR FIXED AND VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE ARE

ACCUMULATION VALUES, I.E., THE AGGREGATE OF THE VALUES CONTRACT HOLDERS HAVE

ON ACCOUNT.

POLICY RESERVES FOR FUTURE BENEFITS ON TERM AND WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE ARE

BASED ON THE NET LEVEL PREMIUM METHOD, USING ANTICIPATED MORTALITY RATES (THE

LIKELIHOOD OF AN INSURED'S DEATH), POLICY PERSISTENCY RATES AND INTEREST RATES

EARNED ON THE ASSETS SUPPORTING RESERVES. ANTICIPATED MORTALITY RATES ARE BASED

ON ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY MORTALITY TABLES, WITH MODIFICATIONS BASED ON THE IDS

LIFE COMPANIES' EXPERIENCE. ANTICIPATED POLICY PERSISTENCY RATES VARY BY POLICY

FORM, ISSUE AGE AND POLICY DURATION. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK GENERALLY

ANTICIPATE PERSISTENCY RATES ON LEVEL TERM AND CASH VALUE PLANS TO BE BETTER

THAN PERSISTENCY ON YEARLY RENEWABLE TERM INSURANCE PLANS. ANTICIPATED INTEREST

RATES ON ASSETS HELD TO SUPPORT RESERVES RANGE FROM 4% TO 10%, DEPENDING ON

POLICY FORM, ISSUE YEAR AND POLICY DURATION.

LIABILITIES FOR FUTURE DI AND LTC POLICY BENEFITS INCLUDE BOTH POLICY

RESERVES AND CLAIM RESERVES. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK BASE POLICY

RESERVES ON THE NET LEVEL PREMIUM METHOD, USING ANTICIPATED MORBIDITY RATES

(MEANING, CLAIM FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY), MORTALITY RATES (THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN

INSURED'S DEATH, WHICH MEANS NO DI OR LTC BENEFITS WILL BECOME PAYABLE), POLICY

PERSISTENCY RATES, AND INTEREST RATES EARNED ON THE ASSETS SUPPORTING RESERVES.

THEY BASE ANTICIPATED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY RATES ON ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY

MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY TABLES. ANTICIPATED POLICY PERSISTENCY RATES VARY BY

POLICY FORM, ISSUE AGE, POLICY DURATION AND, FOR DI POLICIES, OCCUPATION CLASS.

ANTICIPATED INTEREST RATES ON ASSETS HELD TO SUPPORT DI AND LTC POLICY RESERVES

ARE 3% TO 9.5% AT POLICY ISSUE AND LEVEL OFF AT ULTIMATE RATES OF 5% TO 7% OVER

5 TO 10 YEARS.

IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK CALCULATE CLAIM RESERVES FOR DI AND LTC

BASED ON CLAIM CONTINUANCE TABLES AND ANTICIPATED INTEREST RATES EARNED ON

ASSETS SUPPORTING THESE RESERVES. THEY BASE ANTICIPATED

PAGE 40

CLAIM CONTINUANCE RATES ON ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY TABLES. ANTICIPATED INTEREST

RATES ON ASSETS HELD TO SUPPORT CLAIM RESERVES FOR BOTH DI AND LTC RANGE FROM 5%

TO 8%.

ANNUITY LIABILITIES. LIABILITIES FOR FIXED AND VARIABLE DEFERRED ANNUITIES

ARE ACCUMULATION VALUES, I.E., THE AGGREGATE OF THE VALUES CONTRACT OWNERS HAVE

ON ACCOUNT.

LIABILITIES FOR FIXED ANNUITIES IN A BENEFIT OR "PAYOUT" STATUS ARE BASED

ON ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY MORTALITY TABLES AND INTEREST RATES ESTABLISHED IN THE

YEAR OF ISSUE OR COMMENCEMENT OF PAYOUT. THE LATTER RANGE FROM 5% TO 9.5%, WITH

AN AVERAGE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 6.5%.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS ("DAC")

THE IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES DEFER THE COSTS OF ACQUIRING NEW BUSINESS

ON THE SALE OF INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS, INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE, DIRECT

SALES COMMISSIONS, RELATED SALES INCENTIVE BONUSES AND AWARDS, AND UNDERWRITING

COSTS, POLICY ISSUE COSTS AND OTHER RELATED COSTS. THE DAC FOR UNIVERSAL LIFE

AND VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE AND CERTAIN INSTALLMENT ANNUITIES ARE

AMORTIZED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE ESTIMATED GROSS PROFITS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED

ON THE POLICIES. DAC FOR OTHER ANNUITIES ARE AMORTIZED USING THE INTEREST

METHOD. FOR TRADITIONAL LIFE, DISABILITY INCOME AND LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE

POLICIES, THE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED IN PROPORTION TO PREMIUM REVENUE.

AMORTIZATION OF DAC REQUIRES THE USE OF CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING

INTEREST MARGINS, MORTALITY RATES, PERSISTENCY RATES, MAINTENANCE EXPENSE LEVELS

AND CUSTOMER ASSET VALUE GROWTH RATES FOR VARIABLE PRODUCTS. THE CUSTOMER ASSET

VALUE GROWTH RATE IS THE RATE AT WHICH CONTRACT VALUES ARE ASSUMED TO APPRECIATE

IN THE FUTURE. THIS RATE IS NET OF ASSET FEES, AND ANTICIPATES A BLEND OF EQUITY

AND FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. MANAGEMENT ROUTINELY MONITORS A WIDE VARIETY OF

TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING COMPARISONS OF ACTUAL AND ASSUMED EXPERIENCE.

MANAGEMENT REVIEWS AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, ADJUSTS ITS ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT

TO CUSTOMER ASSET VALUE GROWTH RATES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

MANAGEMENT MONITORS OTHER PRINCIPAL DAC ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS PERSISTENCY

RATES, MORTALITY RATES, INTEREST MARGINS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE LEVELS, EACH

QUARTER. UNLESS MANAGEMENT IDENTIFIES A MATERIAL DEVIATION OVER THE COURSE OF

THE QUARTERLY MONITORING, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS AND UPDATES THESE DAC ASSUMPTIONS

ANNUALLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. WHEN ASSUMPTIONS ARE CHANGED, THE

PERCENTAGE OF ESTIMATED GROSS PROFITS OR PORTION OF INTEREST MARGINS USED TO

AMORTIZE DAC MAY ALSO CHANGE. A CHANGE IN THE REQUIRED AMORTIZATION PERCENTAGE

IS APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY; AN INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION PERCENTAGE WILL RESULT

IN AN ACCELERATION OF DAC AMORTIZATION WHILE A DECREASE IN AMORTIZATION

PERCENTAGE WILL RESULT IN A DECELERATION OF DAC AMORTIZATION. THE IMPACT ON

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF CHANGING ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE AMORTIZATION

OF DAC CAN BE EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD AND IS

REFLECTED IN THE PERIOD THAT SUCH CHANGES ARE MADE.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002, AEFA COMPLETED A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF

ITS DAC-RELATED PRACTICES THAT RESULTED IN A NET $44 MILLION INCREASE IN

EXPENSES FOR THE QUARTER, OF WHICH $37 MILLION RELATED TO THE IDS LIFE INSURANCE

COMPANIES. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF DAC AND THE COMPANY'S REVIEW OF ITS

DAC-RELATED PRACTICES, SEE PAGES 45 THROUGH 46 UNDER THE CAPTION

INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES

AMERICAN EXPRESS CERTIFICATE COMPANY ("AECC"), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

AEFC, ISSUES FACE-AMOUNT INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES. AECC IS REGISTERED AS AN

INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940. AECC CURRENTLY

ISSUES 10 TYPES OF FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES. OWNERS OF AECC CERTIFICATES ARE

ENTITLED TO RECEIVE, AT MATURITY, A STATED AMOUNT OF MONEY EQUAL TO THE

AGGREGATE INVESTMENTS IN THE CERTIFICATE PLUS INTEREST AT RATES DECLARED FROM

TIME TO TIME BY AECC. IN ADDITION, PERSONS OWNING THREE TYPES OF CERTIFICATES

MAY HAVE THEIR INTEREST CALCULATED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BASED ON ANY UPWARD

MOVEMENT IN A BROAD-BASED STOCK MARKET INDEX UP TO A VARIABLE MAXIMUM RETURN.

THE CERTIFICATES ISSUED BY AECC ARE NOT INSURED BY ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY. AEFC

ACTS AS INVESTMENT MANAGER FOR AECC. CERTIFICATES ARE SOLD BY AEFA'S FIELD

FORCE. AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK ALSO DISTRIBUTES CERTIFICATES.

AECC BELIEVES IT IS THE LARGEST ISSUER OF FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES IN THE

UNITED STATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, IT HAD APPROXIMATELY $5.2 BILLION IN

ASSETS. AECC'S CERTIFICATES COMPETE WITH MANY OTHER INVESTMENTS OFFERED BY

BANKS, SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS, CREDIT UNIONS, MUTUAL FUNDS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES AND SIMILAR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH MAY BE VIEWED BY POTENTIAL

CUSTOMERS AS OFFERING A COMPARABLE OR SUPERIOR COMBINATION OF SAFETY AND RETURN

ON INVESTMENT.

MUTUAL FUNDS

AEFA OFFERS A VARIETY OF PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS, FOR WHICH AEFAI ACTS AS

PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER (DISTRIBUTOR OF SHARES). AEFC ACTS AS INVESTMENT MANAGER

AND PERFORMS VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' FUNDS

CONSIST OF 58 RETAIL MUTUAL FUNDS, WITH VARIED INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND

INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, MONEY MARKET, TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT BOND AND STOCK FUNDS.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FUNDS, WITH COMBINED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 OF $64

BILLION, WAS THE 29TH LARGEST MUTUAL FUND FAMILY IN THE UNITED STATES AND,

EXCLUDING MONEY MARKET FUNDS, WAS THE 13TH LARGEST.

AEFC EARNS MANAGEMENT FEES FOR MANAGING THE ASSETS OF THE PROPRIETARY

MUTUAL FUNDS BASED ON THE UNDERLYING ASSET VALUES. MOST OF THE PROPRIETARY

MUTUAL FUNDS HAVE A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE ADJUSTMENT ("PIA"). THIS PIA ADJUSTS

THE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED, BOTH UPWARD AND DOWNWARD, BASED ON THE

SPECIFIC FUND'S RELATIVE PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED AGAINST A DESIGNATED

PAGE 42

EXTERNAL INDEX. AEFA EARNS FEES PRIMARILY FOR DISTRIBUTING THE PROPRIETARY

MUTUAL FUNDS, POINT-OF-SALE FEES (I.E., SALES CHARGES) AND DISTRIBUTION FEES

(12B-1 FEES) BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS FUNDS ARE SOLD IN SIX CLASSES. FOR MOST FUNDS, SHARES ARE

SOLD IN FOUR CLASSES - A, B, C AND Y. INDEX FUND SHARES ARE SOLD IN TWO CLASSES

- D AND E. CLASS A SHARES ARE SOLD AT NET ASSET VALUE PLUS ANY APPLICABLE SALES

CHARGE. THE MAXIMUM SALES CHARGE IS 5.75% FOR EQUITY FUNDS AND 4.75% FOR INCOME

FUNDS, WITH REDUCED SALES CHARGES FOR LARGER PURCHASES. THE SALES CHARGE MAY BE

WAIVED FOR CERTAIN PURCHASES, INCLUDING THOSE MADE THROUGH AN INVESTMENT PRODUCT

SPONSORED BY AEFAI OR ANOTHER AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY. CLASS B SHARES

ARE SOLD WITH A CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE OR BACK-END LOAD. THE MAXIMUM

DEFERRED SALES CHARGE IS 5%, DECLINING TO NO CHARGE FOR SHARES HELD MORE THAN

SIX YEARS. CLASS C SHARES DO NOT HAVE A FRONT-END SALES CHARGE. A 1% CONTINGENT

DEFERRED SALES CHARGE MAY APPLY TO SHARES REDEEMED LESS THAN ONE YEAR AFTER

PURCHASE. CLASS Y SHARES ARE PRIMARILY SOLD TO INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS WITH NO

LOAD. THERE ARE TWO INDEX FUNDS, WHICH ARE SOLD IN TWO NO-LOAD CLASSES. CLASS D

SHARES ARE SOLD WITH A 0.25% FEE FOR DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, BUT WITHOUT A SALES

CHARGE, THROUGH AN INVESTMENT PRODUCT SPONSORED BY AEFA OR ANOTHER AUTHORIZED

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. CLASS E SHARES ARE SOLD WITHOUT A SALES OR DISTRIBUTION

FEE THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND QUALIFYING INSTITUTIONAL

ACCOUNTS.

FIFTEEN OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FUNDS ARE STRUCTURED AS FEEDER FUNDS

INVESTING IN THE PREFERRED MASTER TRUST GROUP, A GROUP OF 15 MASTER FUNDS,

ADVISED BY AEFC. THIS FEEDER STRUCTURE PROVIDES FOR POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF

ADDITIONAL CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION.

IN ADDITION TO FULL-COMMISSION AND DISCOUNT BROKERAGE FIRMS, COMPETITORS

INCLUDE OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES.

TRENDS IN THE MARKET OVER THE LAST DECADE, INCLUDING THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR

MUTUAL FUNDS BY RETAIL INVESTORS, EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS IN THE

INDUSTRY. SOME COMPETITORS ARE LARGER, MORE DIVERSIFIED AND OFFER A GREATER

NUMBER OF PRODUCTS, AND MAY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THEIR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND

RETAIN CUSTOMERS ON THE BASIS OF ONE-STOP SHOPPING. THE COMPETITIVE FACTORS

AFFECTING THE SALE OF MUTUAL FUNDS INCLUDE SALES CHARGES ("LOADS") PAID,

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, SERVICES RECEIVED, THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A

NETWORK OF THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, FUND RATINGS ISSUED

BY THIRD-PARTIES SUCH AS MORNINGSTAR, THE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

OFFERED, THE CONVENIENCE TO THE INVESTOR, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION CAMPAIGNS,

AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS. THE FUNDS COMPETE WITH OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING FUNDS THAT HAVE NO SALES CHARGE ("NO-LOAD" FUNDS) AND FUNDS

DISTRIBUTED THROUGH INDEPENDENT BROKERAGE FIRMS, AND EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS.

OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AEFAI SPONSORS TWO WRAP PROGRAMS MARKETED THROUGH FINANCIAL ADVISORS,

MARKETING EMPLOYEES AND THIRD-PARTY REFERRALS. AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' WEALTH

MANAGEMENT SERVICE IS A PROFESSIONALLY MANAGED DISCRETIONARY WRAP ACCOUNT BASED

ON MODEL PORTFOLIOS OF INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES. AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' STRATEGIC

PORTFOLIO SERVICE ADVANTAGE IS A NON-DISCRETIONARY MUTUAL FUND AND INDIVIDUAL

SECURITY WRAP PROGRAM BUILT AROUND ASSET-ALLOCATION STRATEGIES. AT DECEMBER 31,

2002, ASSETS IN BOTH WRAP PROGRAMS OFFERED BY AEFAI TOTALED $17.5 BILLION FOR

APPROXIMATELY 246,576 ACCOUNTS.

INTEREST INCOME IS RECOGNIZED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. LOANS OTHER THAN CERTAIN

CONSUMER LOANS ARE PLACED ON NON-PERFORMING STATUS WHEN PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL OR

INTEREST ARE 90 DAYS PAST DUE OR IF, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, THE BORROWER IS

UNLIKELY TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WHEN LOANS ARE PLACED ON

NON-PERFORMING STATUS, ALL PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST IS REVERSED

AGAINST CURRENT INTEREST INCOME. CASH RECEIPTS OF INTEREST ON NON-PERFORMING

LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED EITHER AS INTEREST INCOME OR AS A REDUCTION OF PRINCIPAL,

BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT AS TO THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF PRINCIPAL.

GENERALLY, A NON-PERFORMING LOAN MAY BE RETURNED TO PERFORMING STATUS WHEN ALL

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS DUE ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF REPAYMENT WITHIN A REASONABLE

PERIOD AND THE BORROWER SHOWS SUSTAINED REPAYMENT PERFORMANCE, IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN OR WHEN THE LOAN HAS BECOME WELL SECURED

AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.

CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES, INTEREST-EARNING ADVANCES UNDER LINES OF CREDIT

AND OTHER SIMILAR CONSUMER LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE RESERVE FOR CREDIT

LOSSES UPON REACHING SPECIFIED CONTRACTUAL DELINQUENCY STAGES, OR EARLIER IN THE

EVENT OF THE BORROWER'S PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY OR IF THE LOAN IS OTHERWISE DEEMED

UNCOLLECTIBLE. INTEREST INCOME ON THESE LOANS GENERALLY ACCRUES UNTIL THE LOAN

IS WRITTEN OFF.

AEB SEPARATELY MAINTAINS AND PROVIDES FOR RESERVES RELATING TO CREDIT

LOSSES FOR LOANS, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER CREDIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE RESERVE

IS ESTABLISHED BY CHARGING A PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AGAINST INCOME. THE

AMOUNT CHARGED TO INCOME IS BASED UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL

CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN RELATION TO OUTSTANDING CREDITS, A CONTINUOUS

ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF EACH CREDIT, AND MANAGEMENT EVALUATION OF

EXPOSURES IN EACH APPLICABLE COUNTRY AS RELATED TO CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY OF

THE RESERVE IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE, AS SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED.

AMOUNTS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE ARE CHARGED AGAINST THE RESERVE AND SUBSEQUENT

RECOVERIES, IF ANY, ARE CREDITED TO THE RESERVE.

THE RESERVE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO LOANS IS REPORTED AS A REDUCTION

OF LOANS. THE RESERVE RELATED TO DERIVATIVES IS REPORTED AS A REDUCTION OF

TRADING ASSETS AND THE RESERVE RELATED TO OTHER CREDIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS

REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES.

RISKS

THE GLOBAL NATURE OF AEB'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IS SUCH THAT CONCENTRATIONS

OF CREDIT TO PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS ARE NOT UNUSUAL. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, AEB HAD SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN ON- AND

OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY REPRESENTED BY

DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES, LOANS, FORWARD CONTRACTS, CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS

OF LETTERS OF CREDIT (STANDBY AND COMMERCIAL) AND GUARANTEES. THE COUNTERPARTIES

TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WERE PRIMARILY UNRELATED TO AEB, AND PRINCIPALLY

CONSISTED OF BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND VARIOUS COMMERCIAL AND

INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES OPERATING GEOGRAPHICALLY WITHIN THE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION,

EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA, LATIN AMERICA AND THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT. AEB

CONTINUALLY MONITORS AND ACTIVELY MANAGES ITS CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS TO REDUCE

THE ASSOCIATED RISK.

PAGE 53

IN DECEMBER 2001 AND JANUARY 2002, THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT MANDATED THE

CONVERSION OF U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED ASSETS INTO ARGENTINE PESOS AND

SIMULTANEOUSLY DEVALUED THE PESO. AEB'S CREDIT EXPOSURES TO ARGENTINA AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001 WERE $28 MILLION AND $56 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH

INCLUDE LOANS OF $17 MILLION AND $25 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

DURING LATE 2001 AND 2002, THE HONG KONG MARKET EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT

INCREASE IN BANKRUPTCY FILINGS DUE TO AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND CHANGES IN HONG

KONG LAW REGARDING PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY. ACCORDINGLY, DURING 2002 AEB

SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED ITS PROVISION FOR CONSUMER LOAN LOSSES TO REFLECT THE

EXPECTATION OF HIGHER BANKRUPTCY RELATED WRITE-OFFS. IN ADDITION, AEB TOOK

CERTAIN ACTIONS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT TO ITS CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING

SUSPENDING ALL NEW LOAN ORIGINATIONS IN HONG KONG BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2002. RECENT TRENDS SHOW THAT LOSSES IN THIS PORTFOLIO HAVE BEGUN TO

STABILIZE. AEB CONTINUES TO CLOSELY MONITOR THIS PORTFOLIO.

IN AN ONGOING EFFORT TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AEB'S CREDIT RISKS, AS WELL

AS ITS DECISION TO SHIFT ITS BUSINESS FOCUS FROM CORPORATIONS TO INDIVIDUALS,

AEB CONTINUED TO REDUCE ITS WHOLESALE CREDIT EXPOSURE IN 2002, PARTICULARLY WITH

RESPECT TO ITS ASIA/PACIFIC COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO. AEB CONTINUES TO

CAREFULLY MONITOR ITS CREDIT EXPOSURES.

AEB'S EARNINGS ARE SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, AS IT IS

NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO MATCH PRECISELY THE MATURITIES OF INTEREST-RELATED ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, STRICT EARNINGS AT RISK LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED AT BOTH

THE COUNTRY AND OVERALL BANK LEVEL TO LIMIT AEB'S EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE

FLUCTUATIONS. ON OCCASION, AEB MAY DECIDE TO MISMATCH IN ANTICIPATION OF A

CHANGE IN FUTURE INTEREST RATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE GUIDELINES. TERM LOANS

EXTENDED BY AEB INCLUDE BOTH FLOATING AND FIXED INTEREST RATE LOANS.

BECAUSE AEB CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS IN EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES AND

IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE LESS POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY STABLE THAN THOSE IN THE

UNITED STATES OR WESTERN EUROPE, ITS PRIVATE BANKING, PFS AND CORRESPONDENT

BANKING ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO GREATER CREDIT AND COMPLIANCE RISKS THAN

ARE FOUND IN MORE WELL-DEVELOPED JURISDICTIONS. AEB CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS ITS

EXPOSURES IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, AND REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS CLIENT BASE TO

IDENTIFY POTENTIAL LEGAL RISKS AS A RESULT OF CLIENTS' USE OF AEB'S BANKING

SERVICES.

FOR A DISCUSSION RELATING TO AEB'S USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

SEE PAGE 51 UNDER THE CAPTION "RISK MANAGEMENT," AND NOTE 9 ON PAGES 70 THROUGH

72 OF THE COMPANY'S 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS OF SUCH

REPORT ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

COMPETITION

THE BANKING SERVICES OF AEB ARE SUBJECT TO VIGOROUS COMPETITION EVERYWHERE

AEB OPERATES. COMPETITORS INCLUDE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL BANKS WHOSE ASSETS

OFTEN EXCEED THOSE OF AEB, OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING CERTAIN OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY) AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.

PAGE 54

REGULATION

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. ("AEBL") IS A WHOLLY OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANKING CORP. ("AEBC"). AEBC IS A NEW YORK INVESTMENT COMPANY

ORGANIZED UNDER ARTICLE XII OF THE NEW YORK BANKING LAW AND IS A WHOLLY OWNED

DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. AEBC, AEBL AND AEBL'S GLOBAL NETWORK OF

OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS SUPERVISION AND

EXAMINATION BY THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT ("NYSBD") PURSUANT TO THE

NEW YORK BANKING LAW. AEBC DOES NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN BANKING ACTIVITIES.

AEBL'S BRANCHES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE LICENSED AND

REGULATED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE

SAME LOCAL REQUIREMENTS AS OTHER COMPETITORS THAT HAVE THE SAME LICENSE. WITHIN

THE UNITED STATES, AEBL'S NEW YORK AGENCY IS SUPERVISED AND REGULARLY EXAMINED

BY THE NYSBD. IN ADDITION, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

(THE "FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD") REGULATES, SUPERVISES AND EXAMINES AEBI AND THE

CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISES AND EXAMINES AEBL'S

SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO FACILITY OFFICES.

SINCE AEBL DOES NOT DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, EXCEPT AS AN INCIDENT

TO ITS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY'S AFFILIATION WITH AEBL

NEITHER CAUSES THE COMPANY TO BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BANK HOLDING

COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED, NOR REQUIRES IT TO REGISTER AS A BANK HOLDING

COMPANY UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD'S REGULATION Y. AEBL IS NOT A MEMBER OF

THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, IS NOT SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION BY THE FDIC, AND IS

NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE COMPETITIVE EQUALITY

BANKING ACT OF 1987 OTHER THAN ANTI-TIE-IN RULES WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS

INVOLVING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES. AEBL IS NOT A

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT.

AEBL IS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD'S RISK-BASED

CAPITAL GUIDELINES AND COMPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE CONSTRAINT APPLICABLE TO

STATE-CHARTERED BANKS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. PURSUANT

TO THE FDIC IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AMONG OTHER

FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES, ADOPTED REGULATIONS DEFINING LEVELS OF CAPITAL

ADEQUACY. UNDER THESE REGULATIONS, A BANK IS DEEMED TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED IF IT

MAINTAINS A TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST SIX PERCENT, A TOTAL

RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10.0 PERCENT, AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT

LEAST FIVE PERCENT. BASED ON AEBL'S TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE

RATIOS, WHICH ARE SET FORTH ON PAGE 47, AEBL IS CONSIDERED TO BE WELL

CAPITALIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

IN RECENT YEARS U.S. AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, TOGETHER WITH

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE RAISED INCREASING CONCERNS OVER THE ABILITY OF

CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CORRUPT PERSONS TO USE GLOBAL FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES TO FACILITATE MONEY LAUNDERING. IN THE U.S., THE SECRETARY OF THE

TREASURY HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO THE USA PATRIOT ACT THAT

SPECIFICALLY IMPACT CERTAIN MONEY LAUNDERING PREVENTION ACTIVITIES OF ENTITIES

INVOLVED, AS AEBL IS, IN CORRESPONDENT AND PRIVATE BANKING ACTIVITIES. AEBL HAS

TAKEN STEPS AS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS, AND INCREASED ITS

COMPLIANCE EFFORTS TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING GENERALLY. AEBL MAY INCREASE THESE

EFFORTS TO ADDRESS FURTHER REGULATIONS EXPECTED UNDER THE

PAGE 55

USA PATRIOT ACT AS WELL AS OTHER EVOLVING SUPERVISORY STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS

IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH AEBL DOES BUSINESS.

IN JANUARY 2002 THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE "BASEL

COMMITTEE") RELEASED A PROPOSAL FOR A NEW RISK-BASED BANK CAPITAL ACCORD TO

REPLACE A PRIOR ACCORD THAT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE 1988. THE BASEL COMMITTEE

IS COMPRISED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF CENTRAL BANKS AND CERTAIN BANK SUPERVISORS

FROM THE "GROUP OF TEN" COUNTRIES AND ESTABLISHES GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

GOVERNING THE PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS. THE PROPOSAL WOULD

REFINE THE CURRENT CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT RISK AND MARKET RISK AND

WOULD ADD CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATIONAL RISK. OPERATIONAL RISK MEANS THE

RISK OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT LOSS RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED INTERNAL

PROCESSES, PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS OR FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. MEMBER COUNTRIES ARE

EXPECTED TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW ACCORD BY 2006, ALTHOUGH THE ULTIMATE TIMING FOR A

NEW ACCORD AND SPECIFIC CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE UNCERTAIN. AEBL BELIEVES THAT

IMPLEMENTATION OF AND COMPLIANCE EFFORTS REQUIRED BY THE NEW ACCORD, TO THE

EXTENT APPLICABLE TO AEBL, COULD INCREASE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO AEBL AND RESULT IN CERTAIN CHANGES TO CERTAIN OF

AEBL'S INFORMATION SYSTEMS, PROCESSES AND EMPLOYEE TRAINING.

PAGE 56

CORPORATE AND OTHER

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES - TRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY,

QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE - ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON THE BRAND BY EDUCATING EMPLOYEES ABOUT ITS ATTRIBUTES AND

BY FURTHER INCORPORATING THESE ATTRIBUTES INTO ITS PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS STRATEGY TO OBTAIN PATENTS FOR

ITS BUSINESSES. IN 2002, THE COMPANY FILED MORE THAN 100 U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENT

APPLICATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS DEVOTED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO ITS GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY

PLATFORMS AND UNDERTAKEN SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO PROTECT AND MANAGE ITS

PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS AND THE DATA COLLECTED AND STORED ON SUCH SYSTEMS. IN THIS

VEIN, THE COMPANY HAS CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON WAYS TO SECURE SUCH SYSTEMS FROM

"HACKERS" AND OTHER UNAUTHORIZED USERS.

THE COMPANY USES INFORMATION ABOUT ITS CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED SERVICES. REGULATORY ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS

OF PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES TO GROW WORLDWIDE AND IS GENERALLY

BEING DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY AND CONCOMITANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE

RAPID AND WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION AND USE OF INFORMATION. FEDERAL REGULATIONS

IMPLEMENTING THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT ("GLBA") BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1,

2001. GLBA PROVIDES FOR DISCLOSURE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION'S PRIVACY POLICIES

AND PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO "OPT OUT" OF THE INSTITUTION'S

DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES

(WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS). THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS THAT

AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS, AND SEVERAL STATES AND

MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ADOPTED SUCH LEGISLATION. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE ITS

EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW

AND ITS INTERNAL DATA PROTECTION POLICIES, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE

POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT, WHILE SEEKING TO PROPERLY COLLECT AND USE DATA TO

ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.

IN ADDITION, PROVISIONS OF THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT THAT PREEMPT

STATES FROM ENACTING LEGISLATION REGARDING THE SHARING OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION

AMONG AFFILIATES AND REGARDING CERTAIN USES OF CONSUMER REPORT INFORMATION

EXPIRE ON JANUARY 1, 2004. WITHOUT FURTHER CONGRESSIONAL ACTION, STATES WOULD BE

PERMITTED TO ENACT LAWS THAT PLACE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON HOW CUSTOMER DATA MAY

BE SHARED AMONG COMPANY AFFILIATES AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S USE

OF CONSUMER REPORT DATA. IF SUCH LAWS WERE ENACTED, COMPLYING WITH VARYING STATE

REQUIREMENTS MIGHT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVELY

PERSONALIZED SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

FEDERAL PRIVACY RULES PROMULGATED UNDER THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY

AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996 ("HIPAA") WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 14,

2003. THE RULES ADDRESS THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF HEALTH CARE CUSTOMERS AND THE

OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY WHEN OBTAINING AND USING PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION.

IN ADDITION, BOTH HIPPA AND GLBA REGULATIONS REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF SECURITY

STANDARDS TO SAFEGUARD THE INTEGRITY, CONFIDENTIALITY AND ACCESS OF HEALTH AND

FINANCIAL CUSTOMER DATA.

PAGE 57

IN 2002, THE COMPANY OUTSOURCED MOST OF ITS TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS WORK TO

IBM. THIS ARRANGEMENT, WHICH HAS A SEVEN-YEAR TERM WITH OPTIONS TO EXTEND, WILL

ENABLE THE COMPANY TO BENEFIT FROM IBM'S EXPERTISE WHILE LOWERING ITS

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS. IBM HAS TAKEN ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANAGING MOST

OF THE COMPANY'S DAY-TO-DAY TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING

MAINFRAME, MIDRANGE AND DESKTOP SYSTEMS; WEB HOSTING; DATABASE ADMINISTRATION;

HELP DESK SERVICES; AND DATA CENTER OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGIES

ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO RETAIN ITS CORE TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCIES, INCLUDING

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY, MANAGING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH

TECHNOLOGIES' PARTNERS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING APPLICATIONS AND DATABASES,

AND MANAGING THE TECHNOLOGIES' PORTFOLIOS OF ITS BUSINESSES.

IN THE U.S., THE USA PATRIOT ACT (THE "PATRIOT ACT") WAS ENACTED IN OCTOBER

2001 IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11TH TERRORIST ATTACKS. THE PATRIOT ACT

CONTAINS A WIDE VARIETY OF PROVISIONS AIMED AT FIGHTING TERRORISM, INCLUDING

PROVISIONS AIMED AT ATTACKING TERRORISTS' ABILITY TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED

IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PATRIOT ACT DIRECTS

FEDERAL REGULATORS, LED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, TO PROMULGATE

REGULATIONS OR TAKE OTHER STEPS TO REQUIRE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING EXPANDED

REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS.

WHILE THE COMPANY HAS LONG MAINTAINED MONEY LAUNDERING PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN

ITS BUSINESSES, THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS UNDER THE

PATRIOT ACT APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED

WITHIN AEB, TRS, AEFA AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, PRESCRIBING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR

SUCH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS, AND IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT FURTHER

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THESE AND TO CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER BUSINESSES

WILL BE ISSUED IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN APRIL 2002, THE U.S. TREASURY

ISSUED DRAFT REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OPERATORS OF CREDIT CARD NETWORKS (SUCH

AS VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB, DISCOVER AND AMERICAN EXPRESS) THAT WOULD

REQUIRE CREDIT CARD NETWORKS TO HAVE RISK-BASED PROGRAMS TO SCREEN INSTITUTIONS

THAT ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE CARDS OR ACQUIRE TRANSACTIONS FROM MERCHANTS ON THEIR

NETWORKS, IN ORDER TO HELP PREVENT THESE NETWORKS FROM BEING USED FOR MONEY

LAUNDERING AND FINANCING TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY HAS INITIATED SUCH A

PROGRAM FOR ITS GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS. TREASURY WILL ALSO BE ISSUING

REGULATIONS REGARDING CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO MANY OF

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANY

REGULATIONS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY PROMULGATED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL TAKE

STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING INITIATIVES ADOPTED IN OTHER

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT CONDUCTS BUSINESS.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUES FROM THE USE OF

THE CARD, TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUES TO BROADEN THE USE OF

THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THE COMPANY'S REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SEE NOTE 18 TO THE COMPANY'S

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT, WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 80 THROUGH 82 OF

THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.) POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

IN THESE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE

PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL

CARDMEMBERS' SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY

CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN OTHER THAN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCY, AND FOR THE

REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES) CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON

THE COMPANY'S REVENUES. SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL

CARDMEMBERS' CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE

PAGE 58

LOCAL ISSUER OF THE CARD IN CONNECTION WITH SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY.

THE MAJORITY OF AEB'S REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM BUSINESS CONDUCTED IN COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SOME OF THE RISKS ATTENDANT TO THOSE OPERATIONS

INCLUDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL

ENVIRONMENTS IN EACH SUCH COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE

POSSIBILITY THAT, BECAUSE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR MAY BE

REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESSER THAN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT

WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECORDED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE

PURCHASE BY CARDMEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE

CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A TRAVELERS

CHEQUE DENOMINATED IN A SECOND CURRENCY; FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS HELD BY AEB

AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ITS CLIENT-RELATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING OPERATIONS; AND,

IN MOST INSTANCES, INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS, UNLESS

PROPERLY MONITORED AND MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S

OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S POLICY IN THIS AREA IS GENERALLY TO MONITOR CLOSELY ALL

FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS AND TO MINIMIZE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES,

FOR EXAMPLE, BY OFFSETTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY

LIABILITIES, AS IN THE CASE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE

FINANCED IN THE SAME CURRENCY. AN ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUE USED TO MANAGE EXPOSURES

IS THE SPOT AND FORWARD PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AS A HEDGE OF NET

EXPOSURES IN THOSE CURRENCIES AS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF THE CARDMEMBER AND

TRAVELERS CHEQUE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, CARDMEMBERS MAY BE

CHARGED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS FOR THEIR SPENDING OUTSIDE THEIR LOCAL COUNTRY.

THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE HEDGED BY FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS OR BY IDENTIFIABLE TRANSACTIONS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

IMPORTANT FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

VARIOUS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS FORM 10-K ANNUAL

REPORT. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY ALSO BE MADE IN THE COMPANY'S OTHER

REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC, IN ITS PRESS RELEASES AND IN OTHER DOCUMENTS. IN

ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY THROUGH ITS MANAGEMENT MAY MAKE ORAL

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED BELOW, WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM SUCH STATEMENTS. THE WORDS "BELIEVE,"

"EXPECT," "ANTICIPATE," "OPTIMISTIC," "INTEND," "PLAN," "AIM," "WILL," "SHOULD,"

"COULD," "LIKELY" AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. READERS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THEY

ARE MADE. THE COMPANY UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE PUBLICLY OR REVISE ANY

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANY'S FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING.

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO.

O    SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT A BUSINESS MODEL THAT ALLOWS FOR SIGNIFICANT

EARNINGS GROWTH BASED ON REVENUE GROWTH THAT IS LOWER THAN HISTORICAL

LEVELS, INCLUDING

PAGE 59

THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE ITS OPERATING EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN

THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME, WHICH WILL DEPEND IN PART ON THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES, AS

WELL AS FACTORS IMPACTING THE COMPANY'S REVENUES;

O    GROW ITS BUSINESS AND MEET OR EXCEED ITS RETURN ON EQUITY TARGET BY

REINVESTING APPROXIMATELY 35% OF ANNUALLY GENERATED CAPITAL AND

RETURNING APPROXIMATELY 65% OF SUCH CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS, OVER

TIME, WHICH WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE

ITS CAPITAL NEEDS AND THE EFFECT OF BUSINESS MIX, ACQUISITIONS AND

RATING AGENCY REQUIREMENTS;

O    INCREASE INVESTMENT SPENDING, WHICH WILL DEPEND IN PART ON THE EQUITY

MARKETS, OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING REVENUES AND THE SUCCESS OF

REENGINEERING PROGRAMS, AND CAPITALIZE ON SUCH INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE

BUSINESS METRICS;

O    EXTEND THE VALUE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS

BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE CARD AND TRAVEL BUSINESSES (E.G., PERCEPTION

OF TRUST, SECURITY AND QUALITY SERVICE), TO A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY;

O    MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS, MERCHANT

BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND

ABROAD, INCLUDING UNSEASONED BALANCES IN TRS' LENDING PORTFOLIOS;

O    ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN THE COMPANY'S

OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES;

O    ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN THE COMPANY'S

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, AND, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

NOT READILY MARKETABLE;

O    SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE IN A TIMELY MANNER SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS AND

OTHER BENEFITS FROM THE REENGINEERING EFFORTS BEING IMPLEMENTED OR

CONSIDERED BY THE COMPANY, INCLUDING COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND

STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER COST

OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE

INTERNET TO SAVE COSTS, THE SCALE-BACK OF CORPORATE LENDING IN CERTAIN

REGIONS, AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF SUCH

REENGINEERING ACTIONS;

O    SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND ITS ONLINE AND OFFLINE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND

CROSS-SELLING FOR FINANCIAL, TRAVEL, CARD AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMER BASE, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY;

O    PARTICIPATE IN PAYMENT AND OTHER SYSTEMS MATERIAL TO ITS BUSINESSES ON

A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE BASIS;

PAGE 60

O    CONTROL AND MANAGE OPERATING, INFRASTRUCTURE, ADVERTISING AND

PROMOTION AND OTHER EXPENSES AS BUSINESS EXPANDS OR CHANGES, INCLUDING

BALANCING THE NEED FOR LONGER TERM INVESTMENT SPENDING;

O    ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE PROVISION FOR THE COST OF THE COMPANY'S

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS'R' PROGRAM;

O    INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES, E.G., TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA

AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS;

O    RECOVER UNDER ITS INSURANCE POLICIES FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE

SEPTEMBER 11TH TERRORIST ATTACKS;

OTHERS WHICH COULD HASTEN BUSINESS MODEL OBSOLESCENCE OR, BECAUSE OF

PATENT RIGHTS HELD BY SUCH COMPETITORS OR OTHERS, LIMIT OR RESTRICT

THE COMPANY'S USE OF DESIRED BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY OR PROCESSES;

O    DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT SUCCESSFULLY ENTERPRISE-WIDE INTERACTIVE

STRATEGIES;

O    IMPROVE ONLINE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, WEBSITE PERFORMANCE AND ONLINE

AVAILABILITY FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS;

O    EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGE ITS ASSETS, SUCH AS ITS BRAND, CUSTOMERS AND

INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE, IN THE INTERNET ENVIRONMENT; AND

O    ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN ALL ITS BUSINESSES.

TRS' ABILITY TO.

O    INCREASE CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON ITS CREDIT

AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES PRODUCTS, GAIN MARKET

SHARE AND DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT CAPTURE

GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS' TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON ITS

NETWORK BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS;

O    EXECUTE THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL CORPORATE SERVICES STRATEGY INCLUDING

GREATER PENETRATION OF MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES, INCREASING CAPTURE OF

NON-T&E; SPENDING THROUGH GREATER USE OF THE COMPANY'S CORPORATE

PURCHASING CARD AND OTHER MEANS, AND FURTHER GLOBALIZING BUSINESS

CAPABILITIES;

O    MANAGE CREDIT RISK AND EXPOSURE IN A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT;

PAGE 61

O    COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS;

O    EXPAND THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS;

O    ENHANCE SIGNIFICANTLY ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, WHICH WILL DEPEND

IN PART ON ITS ABILITY TO REDUCE EXPENSES FOR REINVESTMENT IN THE

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND EXPAND THE PROPRIETARY AND THIRD

PARTY-ISSUED CARD BUSINESSES;

O    RETAIN CARDMEMBERS IN CONSUMER LENDING PRODUCTS AFTER LOW INTRODUCTORY

RATE PERIODS HAVE EXPIRED; AND

O    SUSTAIN PREMIUM DISCOUNT RATES, INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE AND REDUCE

SUPPRESSION, ALL OF WHICH WILL DEPEND IN PART ON ITS ABILITY TO

MAINTAIN A CUSTOMER BASE THAT APPEALS TO MERCHANTS AND TO DEVELOP

DEEPER MERCHANT RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

AEFA'S ABILITY TO.

O    SELL CERTAIN HIGH-YIELD INVESTMENTS AT EXPECTED VALUES AND WITHIN

ANTICIPATED TIMEFRAMES AND TO MAINTAIN ITS HIGH-YIELD PORTFOLIO AT

CERTAIN LEVELS IN THE FUTURE;

O    IMPROVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE IN AEFA'S BUSINESSES, INCLUDING

ATTRACTING AND RETAINING HIGH-QUALITY PERSONNEL;

MARKETS, A SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL MARKET CRASH OR A LONG-TERM FINANCIAL

MARKET DECLINE OR STAGNATION, OR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF RELATIVELY LOW

OR HIGH INTEREST RATES, ANY OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT AND TYPES

OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS SOLD BY AEFA, AEFA'S ABILITY TO EARN TARGET

SPREADS ON FIXED ACCOUNT LIABILITIES, THE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT,

DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER FEES RECEIVED BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF

MANAGED ASSETS, AEFA'S ABILITY TO RECOVER DAC AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF

THAT DAC AMORTIZATION, AND THE LEVEL OF GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH

BENEFITS PAID TO CLIENTS;

O    RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO CHANGES TO OR ELIMINATION OF FEDERAL TAX

BENEFITS FOR AEFA'S PRODUCTS AND OTHER CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS

(INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO THE FEDERAL ESTATE TAX AND RETIREMENT

SAVINGS LAWS) WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES OF INSURANCE AND

ANNUITY PRODUCTS;

PAGE 66

HAS A 48% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. IN 2002, AN AFFILIATE OF

BROOKFIELD FINANCIAL PROPERTIES ACQUIRED THE 52 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE

BUILDING, WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN OWNED BY LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.

DUE TO ITS PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS

WAS DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11TH, 2001. AS A

RESULT OF THESE EVENTS, THE COMPANY HAD TO TEMPORARILY RELOCATE ITS HEADQUARTERS

AND THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO FIVE NEW LEASES FOR APPROXIMATELY 750,000 SQUARE

FEET OF SPACE IN THE NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY AND CONNECTICUT AREA. THE REPAIR WORK

TO THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS WAS COMPLETED ON SCHEDULE DURING 2002 AND THE

COMPANY RELOCATED BACK INTO THE COMPANY HEADQUARTERS. THE COMPANY HAS COMMENCED

EFFORTS TO SUBLEASE PORTIONS OF THE ADDITIONAL SPACE IN THE TRI-STATE AREA. THE

COMPANY FURTHER RELOCATED BACK TO THE WORLD FINANCIAL CENTER EMPLOYEES AT ITS

JERSEY CITY FACILITY WHO HAD BEEN PERMANENTLY BASED AT SUCH LOCATION PRIOR TO

SEPTEMBER 11TH. THE COMPANY HAS COMMENCED TO SUBLEASE THIS SPACE AS WELL.

CAROLINA; SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH; AND THE AMEX CANADA INC. HEADQUARTERS IN

CENTER, A TRAINING FACILITY AND CONFERENCE CENTER IN CHASKA, MINNESOTA.

HEADQUARTERS IN GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN.

SUBSIDIARIES ARE BELIEVED TO BE ADEQUATE FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY ARE

USED AND ARE WELL MAINTAINED.

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT A PARTY TO, NOR ARE ANY OF ITS PROPERTIES THE

SUBJECT OF, ANY PENDING LEGAL OR ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF

ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

ANY PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD AS THE PROCEEDINGS ARE RESOLVED. CERTAIN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE COMPANY ARE SET FORTH BELOW.

BEGINNING IN MID-JULY 2002, 12 PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. IN

EXPRESS COMPANY SECURITIES LITIGATION. THESE LAWSUITS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF THE

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND THE COMMON LAW IN CONNECTION WITH ALLEGED

MISSTATEMENTS REGARDING CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN HIGH-YIELD BONDS AND WRITE DOWNS

COMPLAINT PRINCIPALLY ALLEGES THAT CLASS MEMBERS IMPROPERLY WERE CHARGED DAILY

COMPOUNDED INTEREST ON THE OPTIMA LINE OF CREDIT CARDS AND THAT AECB IMPROPERLY

APPLIED CREDITS FOR RETURNED MERCHANDISE AGAINST OPTIMA BALANCE TRANSFER

BALANCES. LINDMARK ASSERTS VARIOUS CLAIMS INCLUDING VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL

TRUTH IN LENDING ACT, BREACH OF CONTRACT, FRAUD AND UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE

PRACTICES AND VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT. THE

ACTION SEEKS STATUTORY AND ACTUAL DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THIS ACTION, IN

LIGHT OF THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE BURDEN AND EXPENSE OF LENGTHY

LITIGATION, THE COMPANY REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE LAWSUIT. ON NOVEMBER

4, 2002 THE COURT PRELIMINARILY APPROVED THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT FILED BY THE

PARTIES. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT PROVIDES FOR CERTIFICATION OF TWO CLASSES. THE

FIRST CLASS, DEFINED AS THE "FINANCE CHARGE" CLASS, INCLUDES ALL CUSTOMERS WHO

SETTLEMENT OF THE FIRST CLASS CONSISTS OF A SETTLEMENT FUND IN THE AMOUNT OF

WHO ARE ENTITLED TO A REFUND. THE SECOND CLASS, DEFINED AS THE "DELAYED NOTICE"

CLASS, INCLUDES ALL CUSTOMERS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE CHANGE IN TERMS NOTICES AND

WHO, AS A RESULT, INCURRED INCREASED CHARGES BETWEEN

PAGE 68

SEPTEMBER 2001 AND SEPTEMBER 2002. THESE CLASS MEMBERS WILL RECEIVE A REFUND OF

CHARGES AFFECTED BY THE TERMS CHANGES THAT WERE INCURRED DURING THE CLASS

PERIOD. THE COURT IS EXPECTED TO HOLD A HEARING TO CONSIDER FINAL APPROVAL OF

THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IN APRIL 2003. THE COMPANY HAS MADE APPROPRIATE RESERVES

DECISION HAS THE EFFECT OF REQUIRING CORPORATE CUSTOMERS WHO WISH TO USE CREDIT

OR CHARGE CARDS FOR U.K. CORPORATE NET FARES TO PURCHASE TICKETS THROUGH TRAVEL

AGENTS AND PAY A SURCHARGE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BRITISH AIRWAYS' ACTION IS

A MATERIAL BREACH OF ITS MERCHANT AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY. BRITISH AIRWAYS'

COMPLAINT ASKS THE COURT FOR A DECLARATION OF WHETHER ITS CONDUCT IS PROPER.

BRITISH AIRWAYS' COMPLAINT ALSO SEEKS UNSPECIFIED MONETARY DAMAGES, INTEREST,

COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES. BRITISH AIRWAYS HAS ALSO AMENDED ITS ORIGINAL

COMPLAINT TO ADD VARIOUS CLAIMS ALLEGING BREACHES BY THE COMPANY OF VARIOUS
