ITEM 1. BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

("AMERICAN EXPRESS", THE "COMPANY", "WE", "US" OR "OUR"), IS A LEADING PROVIDER

OF TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES, PAYMENT SERVICES, FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND

INTERNATIONAL BANKING SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1850 AS

A JOINT STOCK ASSOCIATION. WE WERE INCORPORATED IN 1965 AS A NEW YORK

CORPORATION.

OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK IN LOWER MANHATTAN. WE

ALSO HAVE OFFICES IN OTHER LOCATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. WE HAVE THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS: TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES ("TRS"),

AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS ("AEFA") AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK ("AEB"),

EACH OF WHOSE BUSINESSES WE WILL DESCRIBE BELOW.

REPORT FILED WITH THE SEC.

2004 HIGHLIGHTS

WE ACHIEVED RECORD REVENUES AND EARNINGS IN 2004, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN OUR

CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD BUSINESSES, GAINS IN OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS AND

A REBOUND IN TRAVEL ACTIVITY. WE BEGAN THE YEAR WITH GOOD MOMENTUM BUILT DURING

THE LATTER HALF OF 2003, AND AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED, OUR PERFORMANCE

STRENGTHENED.

* SOME OF THE STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT CONSTITUTE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

IN SOME CASES, YOU CAN IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY WORDS SUCH AS

"BELIEVE," "EXPECT," "ANTICIPATE," "OPTIMISTIC," "INTEND," "PLAN," "AIM,"

"WILL," "MAY," "SHOULD," "COULD," "WOULD," "LIKELY", "ESTIMATE," "PREDICT,"

"POTENTIAL," OR "CONTINUE" OR THE NEGATIVE OF THESE TERMS OR OTHER SIMILAR

EXPRESSIONS. WE DISCUSS CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO

DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS UNDER "IMPORTANT

FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS" BELOW.

1

WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE RECORD REVENUES AND NET INCOME WHILE AT THE SAME

TIME CONTINUING TO INVEST IN OUR FUTURE BY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING OUR SPENDING

ON BUSINESS-BUILDING ACTIVITIES, WHICH RESULTED IN GROWTH IN SPENDING ON OUR

CARD PRODUCTS AND CARDS-IN-FORCE, HIGHER SALES AND ASSET LEVELS AT AEFA AND

HIGHER PRIVATE BANKING HOLDINGS AT AEB.

COMPARED WITH 2003, WE DELIVERED.

-     REVENUES OF $29.1 BILLION, UP 13% FROM $25.8 BILLION

-     NET INCOME OF $3.4 BILLION, UP 15% FROM $3.0 BILLION

-     DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.68, UP 17% FROM $2.30

-     RETURN ON EQUITY OF 22.0%, COMPARED WITH 20.6%

THESE RESULTS EXCEEDED OUR LONG-TERM TARGETS OF 12% TO 15% EARNINGS PER

SHARE GROWTH, 8% REVENUE GROWTH AND 18% TO 20% RETURN ON EQUITY, ON AVERAGE AND

OVER TIME.

FOR A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL

INFORMATION REGARDING EACH OF OUR THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS, SEE PAGES 26-123

OF THE COMPANY'S 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED

HEREIN BY REFERENCE. FOR A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY AND OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS,

AND A DISCUSSION OF OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF REVENUE, SEE PAGES 26-29 AND

PAGES 82-84 OF THE 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.

SPIN-OFF OF AEFA

ON FEBRUARY 1, 2005, WE ANNOUNCED OUR INTENTION TO PURSUE A SPIN-OFF OF

OUR AEFA OPERATING UNIT TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. IN THE TRANSACTION, AMERICAN

EXPRESS SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE 100% OF THE COMMON SHARES OF AMERICAN EXPRESS

FINANCIAL CORPORATION ("AEFC"), THE WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY THAT DIRECTLY AND

THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES CONDUCTS OUR AEFA BUSINESS. THE

TRANSACTION IS INTENDED TO BE TAX FREE TO SHAREHOLDERS AND IS EXPECTED TO BE

COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE SPIN-OFF, OUR SHAREHOLDERS WOULD HAVE A SEPARATE

INTEREST IN TWO DISTINCT CORPORATE GROUPS - THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GROUP AND THE

AEFC GROUP. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GROUP WOULD CONSIST PRIMARILY OF THE NETWORK,

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD, TRAVELERS CHEQUE AND PREPAID SERVICES AND TRAVEL

BUSINESSES OF THE TRS OPERATING SEGMENT. IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE THE CONSUMER

FINANCIAL SERVICES, PRIVATE BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BUSINESSES OF THE

AEB OPERATING SEGMENT. THE AEFC GROUP WOULD BE COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF THE ASSET

ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS AND INSURANCE BUSINESSES, WHOSE PRODUCTS ARE

OFFERED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH AEFA'S NETWORK OF OVER 12,300 FINANCIAL ADVISORS.

THE TWO GROUPS WOULD BE INDEPENDENT, HAVE SEPARATE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP, BOARDS OF

DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT. TO FACILITATE AEFC'S SEPARATION FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS,

THE COMPANIES PRESENTLY INTEND TO CONTINUE CERTAIN EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS FOR A

TRANSITIONAL PERIOD FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION.

AT THE TIME OF THE SPIN-OFF, WE INTEND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO

AEFC THAT WILL ENABLE IT TO ACHIEVE A SENIOR DEBT RATING THAT PERMITS IT

EFFICIENT ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY, AMERICAN EXPRESS INTENDS

TO CAPITALIZE THE AEFC GROUP'S INSURANCE BUSINESS IN A MANNER THAT WOULD CONFIRM

ITS CURRENT FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS.

2

FOLLOWING THE SPIN-OFF, WE PLAN TO RAISE OUR RETURN ON EQUITY TARGET FROM

18-20 PERCENT TO 28-30 PERCENT, ON AVERAGE AND OVER TIME, AND MAINTAIN OUR

CURRENT DIVIDEND.

WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL INCUR SPIN-OFF RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH

ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY. CUMULATIVELY, THESE EXPENSES COULD BE

SIGNIFICANT. WE EXPECT TO DISCLOSE THESE TRANSITIONAL OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR

FUTURE FILINGS WITH THE SEC, AS WELL AS IN THE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF OUR QUARTERLY

RESULTS.

THE SPIN-OFF IS SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE NECESSARY REGULATORY

APPROVALS, THE RECEIPT OF A FAVORABLE TAX RULING FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE

SERVICE AND/OR A FAVORABLE TAX OPINION FROM OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND FINAL APPROVAL

BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WE HAVE NOT YET DETERMINED THE FINAL TERMS OF THE

TRANSACTION AND PLAN TO DISCLOSE THESE IN OUR FUTURE FILINGS WITH THE SEC.

THIS REPORT DESCRIBES AMERICAN EXPRESS AS PRESENTLY STRUCTURED AND

OPERATED. WHERE APPROPRIATE, WE MAKE REFERENCE TO THE PROPOSED SPIN-OFF

TRANSACTION.

TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES

THE TRS OPERATING SEGMENT INCLUDES OUR CARD, MERCHANT, NETWORK, TRAVELERS

CHEQUE AND TRAVEL BUSINESSES. IT PROVIDES A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS.

-     GLOBAL CARD NETWORK SERVICES;

-     CHARGE CARD AND CREDIT CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE;

-     CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS LENDING PRODUCTS;

-     AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARD PRODUCTS;

-     BUSINESS EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;

-     BUSINESS TRAVEL AND TRAVEL MANAGEMENT SERVICES;

-     CONSUMER TRAVEL SERVICES;

-     MERCHANT ACQUIRING AND TRANSACTION PROCESSING;

-     POINT-OF-SALE AND BACK-OFFICE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS;

-     TAX, ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS CONSULTING SERVICES; AND

-     MAGAZINE PUBLISHING.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WE HAVE GRANTED LICENSES TO PARTIALLY-OWNED AFFILIATES AND

UNAFFILIATED ENTITIES TO OFFER SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

OUR GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK AND CARD ISSUING BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL IN

SCOPE. WE ARE A WORLD LEADER IN PROVIDING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO CONSUMERS,

SMALL BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. AMERICAN EXPRESS(R)-BRANDED CARDS ("CARDS")

ARE CURRENTLY ISSUED IN OVER 45 CURRENCIES. THIS INCLUDES CARDS ISSUED BY

THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. IN 2004, TRS' WORLDWIDE BILLED

BUSINESS (SPENDING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, INCLUDING OUR BRANDED CARDS ISSUED

BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS $416 BILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY $111 BILLION COMING FROM

CARDMEMBERS DOMICILED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. OUR CARDS PERMIT CARDMEMBERS TO

CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT THE

MILLIONS OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO. TRS ADDED A NET TOTAL

OF 4.9 MILLION CARDS IN 2004, BRINGING

3

TOTAL WORLDWIDE CARDS-IN-FORCE TO 65.4 MILLION (INCLUDING OUR BRANDED CARDS

ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES).

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR "SPEND-CENTRIC" BUSINESS MODEL (IN WHICH WE FOCUS

PRIMARILY ON GENERATING REVENUES BY DRIVING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND

SECONDARILY BY FINANCE CHARGES AND FEES) HAS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES.

CARD ISSUERS GENERATE THE MAJORITY OF THEIR INCOME THROUGH SOME COMBINATION OF

CUSTOMER SPENDING (WHICH GENERATES PAYMENTS FROM MERCHANTS FOR CARD

TRANSACTIONS), LENDING (WHICH GENERATES FINANCE CHARGES ON REVOLVING CREDIT

BALANCES) AND CUSTOMER FEES. WE HAVE STRENGTH IN ALL THREE REVENUE STREAMS, AND

WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE EDGE IN SPENDING. ON AVERAGE, U.S. CARDMEMBERS SPEND ABOUT

FOUR TIMES AS MUCH ON THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AS THEY DO ON OTHER CARDS.

FOR MERCHANTS, OUR CARDMEMBERS' HIGHER SPENDING REPRESENTS GREATER VALUE TO THEM

IN THE FORM OF HIGHER SALES AND LOYAL CUSTOMERS, WHICH GIVES US THE ABILITY TO

EARN A PREMIUM DISCOUNT RATE. AS A RESULT, WE CAN GENERATE HIGHER REVENUES FROM

SPENDING AND HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE REWARDS AND OTHER

INCENTIVES TO KEEP CUSTOMERS SPENDING MORE ON THEIR CARDS. THIS, IN TURN, DRIVES

MORE BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS. THIS BUSINESS MODEL

GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WE SEEK TO LEVERAGE TO PROVIDE MORE VALUE

TO CARDMEMBERS, MERCHANTS AND CARD-ISSUING PARTNERS.

TRS' BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATIONS, ALTHOUGH TRAVEL SALES TEND TO BE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER;

TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES OUTSTANDING TEND TO BE GREATEST

EACH YEAR IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD QUARTER; AND CARD-BILLED

BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IN OTHER

QUARTERS.

TRS PLACES SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON ITS TRADEMARKS AND SERVICEMARKS AND

DILIGENTLY PROTECTS ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

TRS OPERATES A GLOBAL GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK

THROUGH ITS GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES ("GNS") BUSINESS. NETWORK FUNCTIONS INCLUDE

OPERATIONS, SERVICE DELIVERY, SYSTEMS, AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING, SETTLEMENT AND

BRAND ADVERTISING AND MARKETING; THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS

FOR THE NETWORK; AND ESTABLISHING AND ENHANCING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS

GLOBALLY, BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE.

SINCE MAY 1996, WE HAVE BEEN PURSUING A STRATEGY OF INVITING U.S. BANKS

AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS ON THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS MERCHANT NETWORK, BUILDING ON A BUSINESS STRATEGY WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED

SUCCESSFULLY IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHERE WE HAVE

MANY BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ISSUING CARDS ON THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS NETWORK. BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL OF THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WE AIM TO BROADEN OUR CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT BASE FOR

OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. OUR GNS BUSINESS HAS ESTABLISHED 87 CARD-ISSUING OR

MERCHANT ACQUIRING PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN

OVER 95 COUNTRIES.

A KEY ASSET OF OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WHICH

IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST HIGHLY RECOGNIZED AND RESPECTED BRANDS. CARDS BEARING

OUR LOGO ARE ISSUED BY TRS

4

AND BY QUALIFIED LICENSED INSTITUTIONS, AND ARE ACCEPTED AT ALL MERCHANT

LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. IN ADDITION,

DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO MAY ALSO BE ACCEPTED AT ALL ATM

LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. TRS ISSUES THE

VAST MAJORITY OF CARDS ON OUR NETWORK.

GNS FOCUSES ON PARTNERING WITH QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS ACCEPTED ON OUR GLOBAL

MERCHANT NETWORK. WHILE TRS' NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS ARE CUSTOMIZED TO THE

PARTICULAR MARKET AND PARTNER REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANS IN

THAT MARKETPLACE, ALL GNS PARTNERSHIPS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP OUR PARTNERS DEVELOP

PRODUCTS FOR THEIR HIGHEST-SPENDING AND MOST AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND TO SUPPORT

THE VALUE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MERCHANTS. WE CHOOSE GNS

PARTNERS WHO SHARE A CORE SET OF ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY

STANDARDS, STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE AND COMPATIBILITY WITH THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS BRAND, AND WE REQUIRE OUR GNS PARTNERS TO ADHERE TO OUR PRODUCT, BRAND

AND SERVICE STANDARDS.

OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS FALL INTO THREE MAIN CATEGORIES. THE FIRST AND MOST

COMMON TYPE OF GNS PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS A NETWORK CARD LICENSE

("NCL") (WHICH WE FORMERLY REFERRED TO AS A NON-PROPRIETARY LICENSE). AT THE END

OF 2004, WE HAD 45 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, WE

GRANT THE PARTNER A LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. WE

GENERALLY PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN MARKETS WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE A STRONG,

WELL-ESTABLISHED LOCAL BUSINESS. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, AMERICAN EXPRESS

MAINTAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ACQUIRE AND SERVICE THE MERCHANTS IN THE LOCAL

MARKET THAT ACCEPT CARDS. OUR NCL PARTNER OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS FOR

ALL CARDS IT ISSUES, PROVIDES SERVICE, BILLING AND CREDIT MANAGEMENT, AND

DESIGNS THE CARD PRODUCT FEATURES, SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS. WE

OPERATE THE MERCHANT NETWORK AND ROUTE AND PROCESS CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE

MERCHANT'S POINT OF SALE THROUGH SUBMISSION TO THE ISSUING PARTNER, AND SETTLE

WITH ISSUING PARTNERS. THE NCL IS THE MODEL THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING WITH BANKS IN

THE UNITED STATES. EXAMPLES OF NCL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH

MBNA AMERICA BANK, N.A. ("MBNA") AND BANCO POPULAR IN PUERTO RICO.

GNS' REVENUES IN NCL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DERIVED FROM THE LEVEL OF CARDMEMBER

SPENDING, ROYALTIES AND FEES CHARGED TO THE CARD ISSUER BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME,

AND OUR PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR THE ISSUER'S CARDS SUCH AS

CARDMEMBER INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER CARD FEATURES AND BENEFITS. AS INDICATED

ABOVE, THE NCL PARTNER BEARS THE CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL AS

THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION COSTS, FRAUD COSTS AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND

OTHER LOYALTY INITIATIVES. WE BEAR THE RISK ARISING FROM THE GNS PARTNER'S

POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE THIS

RISK BY SELECTING GNS PARTNERS WHOM WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL

MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING OUR GNS PARTNERS' FINANCIAL HEALTH,

THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL

AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, WE GENERALLY

REQUIRE GNS PARTNERS TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER

COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

THE SECOND TYPE OF GNS PARTNERSHIP IS KNOWN AS AN INDEPENDENT OPERATOR

("IO") ARRANGEMENT. AS OF THE END OF 2004, WE HAD OVER 30 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS

AROUND THE WORLD. UNDER THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT, OUR BANK PARTNER ISSUES LOCAL

CURRENCY CARDS IN THE PARTICULAR MARKET(S) IN WHICH IT IS LOCATED AND ALSO

SERVES AS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR.

5

OUR LOCAL IO PARTNER OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIT RISK FOR THE

ISSUED CARDS, AND MAKES THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL BE ISSUED

CARDS. GNS' SOURCES OF REVENUES IN IO ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE FEES PAID BY THE IO

PARTNER THAT ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE NUMBER OF CARDS ISSUED BY OUR IO

PARTNERS, BY THE SUBSEQUENT SPENDING ON THOSE CARDS AND BY TOTAL CHARGE VOLUME

ON ALL CARDS AT MERCHANTS WITH WHOM THE GNS PARTNER HAS AN AGREEMENT TO ACCEPT

OUR BRANDED CARDS. OUR IO PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATIONS,

BILLING, PRICING, CARDMEMBER SERVICING AND FUNDING CARD RECEIVABLES. IN

ADDITION, ALL ISSUERS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK BENEFIT FROM THE EXPANDED

MERCHANT COVERAGE DRIVEN BY OUR IO PARTNER, WHICH ACCOMMODATES INBOUND SPENDING

BY CARDMEMBERS FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. THAT, IN TURN, GENERATES

ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR THE ISSUER IN THE CARDMEMBER'S HOME MARKET.

WE TYPICALLY ESTABLISH IO ARRANGEMENTS IN MARKETS WHERE WE HAVE NOT BUILT

A SIGNIFICANT LOCAL CURRENCY CARD BUSINESS OF OUR OWN. THE IO PARTNER'S LOCAL

PRESENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS HELP THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK REACH MERCHANT

COVERAGE GOALS MORE QUICKLY, AND OPERATE AT ECONOMIC SCALES AND COST LEVELS THAT

WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES WHERE WE

HAVE ENTERED INTO IO ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE DENMARK, ECUADOR, PAKISTAN, CROATIA,

PERU AND VIETNAM.

THE THIRD TYPE OF GNS PARTNERSHIP IS A JOINT VENTURE. WE HAVE UTILIZED

THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT IN SWITZERLAND, BELGIUM AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES. IN

THESE MARKETS, TRS JOINS WITH A THIRD PARTY TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN

WHICH TRS HAS A SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP STAKE. THE JOINT VENTURE TYPICALLY SIGNS

NEW MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND ISSUES LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS

LOCALLY THAT CARRY OUR LOGO. IN A JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENT, THE JOINT VENTURE

ASSUMES THE CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK, AND BEARS THE OPERATING AND MARKETING COSTS.

THE ECONOMICS OF THE JOINT VENTURE ARE SIMILAR TO OUR PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING

BUSINESS, WHICH WE DISCUSS BELOW UNDER "CONSUMER CARD, SMALL BUSINESS AND

CONSUMER TRAVEL SERVICES," AND WE RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE JOINT VENTURE'S

INCOME DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST.

GROSS REVENUES WE RECEIVE PER DOLLAR SPENT ON A CARD ISSUED BY A GNS

PARTNER ARE LOWER THAN THOSE FROM OUR PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GNS PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE OPERATING COSTS

AND RISK OF ITS CARD ISSUING BUSINESS, OUR EXPENSES ARE LOWER THAN THOSE IN OUR

PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS. THE GNS BUSINESS MODEL GENERATES AN

ATTRACTIVE EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE THAT REQUIRES A LOWER LEVEL OF

CAPITAL SUPPORT. THE RETURN ON EQUITY IN OUR GNS BUSINESS CAN THUS BE

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS. BECAUSE

THE MAJORITY OF GNS COSTS ARE FIXED, THE GNS BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SCALABLE. GNS

PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND

THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND AND DIFFERENTIATE

THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS WITH INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.

IN 2004, WE SIGNED NEW GNS RELATIONSHIPS WITH 14 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

GNS PARTNERS LAUNCHED A TOTAL OF 67 NEW PRODUCTS DURING 2004, BRINGING THE TOTAL

NUMBER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS PARTNER PRODUCTS TO OVER 400. DURING THE

YEAR, WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED TWO ARRANGEMENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH

THE GNS PARTNER ACTS AS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER IN A PARTICULAR MARKET, BUT

DOES NOT ISSUE CARDS.

6

SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR GNS BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN

2004 INCLUDE.

-     AN AGREEMENT WITH THE INDUSTRIAL & COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA, THE

LARGEST BANK IN CHINA (WITH 20,000 BRANCH LOCATIONS), TO ISSUE THE

FIRST AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CREDIT CARDS IN CHINA, DENOMINATED IN

BOTH LOCAL CHINESE CURRENCY AND U.S. DOLLARS, INCLUDING THE FIRST

ISSUANCE OF THOSE CARDS IN DECEMBER 2004;

-     AN AGREEMENT WITH CORPBANCA IN CHILE TO ISSUE AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED GOLD CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS DENOMINATED IN CHILEAN

PESOS AND U.S. DOLLARS;

-     A PARTNERSHIP WITH WESTPAC BANKING IN AUSTRALIA TO ISSUE THE

COBRANDED ALTITUDE AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CARD, A COMPANION CARD TO

QUALIFIED WESTPAC ALTITUDE CARDMEMBERS;

-     THE LAUNCH OF TWO SN BRUSSELS AIRLINES AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARDS

FROM SN BRUSSELS AIRLINES AND OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER, FORTIS

BANK, WHICH COMBINES THE FEATURES OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD WITH

THE BENEFITS OF SN BRUSSELS AIRLINES FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM.

IN ADDITION, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH HSBC BANK INTERNATIONAL LIMITED

TO MARKET HSBC-BRANDED AMERICAN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY GOLD AND PLATINUM

CHARGE CARDS IN BOTH EUROS AND U.S. DOLLARS TO HSBC'S OFFSHORE BANKING

CUSTOMERS.

IN CONTRAST TO THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHERE BANKS AND

OTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS HAVE ISSUED CARDS ON OUR NETWORK FOR MANY YEARS,

UNTIL 2004 NO MAJOR U.S. BANKS HAD ISSUED CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL MERCHANT NETWORK. THIS SITUATION WAS THE RESULT OF RULES

AND POLICIES OF VISA U.S.A. AND VISA INTERNATIONAL SERVICE ASSOCIATION

(TOGETHER, "VISA") AND MASTERCARD, INCORPORATED AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL,

INC. (TOGETHER, "MASTERCARD") IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH MANDATED EXPULSION OF

MEMBERS WHO ISSUED AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. NO BANK WAS WILLING TO RISK

FORFEITING MEMBERSHIP IN VISA AND/OR MASTERCARD TO ISSUE CARDS ON OUR NETWORK.

IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN OCTOBER 1998 AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD, THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALLEGED THAT THESE RULES AND POLICIES VIOLATED THE

ANTITRUST LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. THE LAWSUIT WENT TO TRIAL IN THE SUMMER OF

2000, AND IN OCTOBER 2001, THE TRIAL JUDGE RULED IN FAVOR OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT

OF JUSTICE, HOLDING THAT THESE RULES AND POLICIES VIOLATE THE ANTITRUST LAWS.

VISA AND MASTERCARD APPEALED THE DECISION AND WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN A STAY OF THE

COURT'S JUDGMENT THROUGHOUT THE APPEALS PROCESS.

AFTER THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE TRIAL

COURT'S DECISION, WE RENEWED OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH BANKS ABOUT ESTABLISHING NCL

PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN JANUARY 2004, WE ANNOUNCED AN

AGREEMENT WITH MBNA UNDER WHICH MBNA WOULD ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS

IN THE UNITED STATES ONCE THE LEGAL PROCESS WAS CONCLUDED AND THE RESTRICTIVE

RULES WERE FINALLY STRUCK DOWN.

7

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO HEAR VISA'S AND

MASTERCARD'S APPEAL. THIS DECISION MARKED THE END OF THE VISA AND MASTERCARD

RULES THAT PREVENTED THEIR MEMBER BANKS FROM ISSUING CARDS ON COMPETITIVE

NETWORKS AND CLEARED THE WAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRIAL COURT'S ORDER

REQUIRING THE REPEAL OF THE ILLEGAL RULES. WE VIEW THIS DECISION AS A MAJOR

VICTORY FOR U.S. CONSUMERS AS WELL AS U.S. BANKS BECAUSE IT OPENS THE DOOR TO

MORE VIGOROUS NETWORK COMPETITION AND MORE INNOVATIVE CARD PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION MEANS THAT WE ARE NOW

ABLE TO OPEN OUR NETWORK TO OTHER CARD ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES, JUST AS WE

HAVE DONE INTERNATIONALLY. BUILDING A NETWORK BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT

OPERATES IN ADDITION TO OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS PROVIDES US WITH NEW AND

SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH.

IN EARLY NOVEMBER 2004, MBNA LAUNCHED ITS FIRST AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED

CREDIT CARDS THROUGH MORE THAN 1,000 AFFINITY GROUPS AFFILIATED WITH MBNA,

INCLUDING ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS, PROFESSIONAL GROUPS AND RECREATIONAL AND

PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS. IN DECEMBER 2004, WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT WITH

CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA) TO ISSUE CARDS THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED ON OUR GLOBAL

MERCHANT NETWORK. WE EXPECT THAT CITIBANK WILL BEGIN TO ISSUE AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, WE FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST VISA, MASTERCARD AND CERTAIN

OF THEIR MEMBER BANKS SEEKING MONETARY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE ILLEGAL RULES

THAT WERE STRUCK DOWN IN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LAWSUIT DISCUSSED ABOVE.

(YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT THIS LAWSUIT IN THE "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" SECTION OF THIS

REPORT BELOW.)

WITH MORE THAN 400 DIFFERENT CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED SO FAR BY OUR BANK

PARTNERS, GNS IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT IS STRENGTHENING OUR

MARKET PRESENCE, DRIVING MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO OUR MERCHANT NETWORK AND

INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. SINCE

THE CREATION OF THE GNS BUSINESS UNIT, GNS PARTNERS HAVE ADDED OVER 8.6 MILLION

NEW CARDS TO OUR NETWORK (NET OF ATTRITION). SINCE 1999, CARDS-IN-FORCE ISSUED

BY GNS PARTNERS HAVE GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 25%. OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES, ONE OF EVERY TWO CARDS ACQUIRED IN 2004 WAS A CARD ISSUED BY ONE

OF OUR GNS PARTNERS, AND GNS PARTNERS BROUGHT NEARLY ONE OF EVERY THREE

MERCHANTS INTO OUR NETWORK. SPENDING ON THESE CARDS HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUND

ANNUAL RATE OF 18% SINCE 1999 AND TOTALED MORE THAN $17.7 BILLION IN 2004.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING TRS' ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS

AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH SUCH ARRANGEMENTS

EXIST, BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY LICENSED TO

ISSUE GENERAL PURPOSE CARDS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR GNS PARTNERS HAVE GENERALLY NOT

HAD DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE MARKETS

IN WHICH TRS HAS CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO GNS PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS.

COMPETITION

OUR NETWORK COMPETES WITH OTHER CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS,

VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB (WHICH, IN THE UNITED STATES, IS BEING FOLDED INTO

THE NETWORK OPERATED BY MASTERCARD), DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES, A BUSINESS UNIT

OF MORGAN STANLEY (PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES), AND JCB CO., LTD. (PRIMARILY

IN ASIA). THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK BUSINESS

INCLUDE.

-     THE NUMBER OF CARDS IN FORCE AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THESE CARDS;

-     THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE PLACES WHERE THE CARDS CAN BE USED;

-     THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS

OF PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK;

-     THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS;

-     REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION;

-     INNOVATION IN SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS; AND

-     THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

GLOBAL ESTABLISHMENT SERVICES

TRS OPERATES A GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING

MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT OUR BRANDED CARDS (MERCHANT ACQUISITION) AND ACCEPTING AND

PROCESSING CARD TRANSACTIONS AND PAYING MERCHANTS (TRANSACTION PROCESSING) THAT

ACCEPT CARDS FOR PURCHASES MADE BY CARDMEMBERS WITH CARDS ("CHARGES"). TRS ALSO

PROVIDES POINT-OF-SALE AND BACK OFFICE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MERCHANTS.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE MERCHANT COVERAGE SO THAT CARDMEMBERS ARE ABLE

TO USE THE CARD WHEREVER AND HOWEVER THEY DESIRE, AS WELL AS TO INCREASE

COVERAGE IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND IN NEW INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT, TO DATE,

ACCEPTED GENERAL PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT. WE ADD

NEW MERCHANTS TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER OF SALES CHANNELS: A PROPRIETARY

SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY SALES AGENTS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH BANKS, THE

INTERNET, TELEMARKETING AND INBOUND "WANT TO HONOR" CALLS (I.E., MERCHANTS

DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD CONTACTING US DIRECTLY).

SINCE THE EARLY 1990'S, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF

MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES THAT

ACCEPT THE CARD. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE

USE OF OUR CARDS FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 65% OF OUR U.S. BILLINGS CAME

FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 35% CAME FROM RETAIL AND OTHER

SECTORS. THAT PROPORTION HAS NOW BEEN MORE THAN REVERSED. IN 2004, U.S.

NON-TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT BILLINGS REPRESENTED 67% OF THE U.S. BILLED

BUSINESS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. THIS SHIFT RESULTED FROM THE GROWTH, OVER

TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS WHO BEGAN TO ACCEPT CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN

RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' INCREASED DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR MORE OF THEIR

PURCHASES, AND OUR FOCUS ON EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MEET CARDMEMBERS'

NEEDS. IN RECENT YEARS, THIS SHIFT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF A DECREASE IN

SPENDING IN TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT RESULTING FROM THE OVERALL ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.

DURING 2004, TRS CONTINUED ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO

USE THE CARD FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. TRS CONTINUED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER AND

TYPES OF MERCHANTS IN RETAIL

9

AND EVERYDAY SPENDING CATEGORIES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD, SUCH AS QUICK-SERVE

RESTAURANTS, RETAIL STORES, SUPERMARKETS AND GAS STATIONS.

KEY SIGNINGS OF MERCHANTS IN 2004 BROUGHT CARD ACCEPTANCE TO INDUSTRIES

WHERE CASH OR CHECKS ARE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF PAYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, TRS

SIGNED AGREEMENTS THIS PAST YEAR WITH TRANSPORT FOR LONDON UNDERGROUND, METROGAS

UTILITIES IN ARGENTINA, SIGMA PHARMACEUTICALS IN AUSTRALIA AND SAFEWAY INC. AND

ALLSTATE GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, CARD ACCEPTANCE AT HOTELS AND

CONFERENCE CENTERS FOR BUSINESS MEETINGS AND EVENTS, BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS

PURCHASES AND APARTMENT RENTALS ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF NEW INDUSTRIES IN WHICH

THE CARD IS NOW ACCEPTED, AND WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO

INCREASING OUR AVERAGE CARDMEMBER SPENDING.

AS IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2004, WE CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE

OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO REFINE OUR APPROACH TO CALCULATING

MERCHANT COVERAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE. GLOBALLY,

ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS CONTINUES TO INCREASE,

INCLUDING AMONG MERCHANTS IN INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. ADDITIONALLY, AS OUR GNS PARTNERS HELP GROW MERCHANT

ACCEPTANCE IN THEIR LOCAL MARKETS, AND AS AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ISSUANCE EXPANDS

IN EMERGING MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE BEGUN TO INCLUDE MERCHANT

COVERAGE INFORMATION DATA FROM GNS MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND FROM THESE EMERGING

MARKETS. AS A RESULT OF THIS REFINED APPROACH, MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT, AS OF

THE END OF 2004, TRS' MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE

THAN 90% OF CARDMEMBERS' GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING, AND

OUR INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT NETWORK ACCOMMODATED OVER 80% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS'

GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING.

WE EARN "DISCOUNT" REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR ACCEPTING

CARDS AS PAYMENT FOR GOODS OR SERVICES SOLD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS THE FEE

CHARGED TO THE MERCHANT FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AND IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A

PERCENTAGE OF THE AMOUNT CHARGED ON A CARD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE IS

GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT THAT THE "MERCHANT ACQUIRER"

(IN MOST CASES, TRS) PAYS TO A MERCHANT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A MERCHANT

ACQUIRER IS THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE MERCHANT,

ACCEPTS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANT, PAYS THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT FOR THESE

TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS THROUGH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK

TO THE APPROPRIATE CARD ISSUER FOR BILLING TO THE CARDMEMBER. WHEN A CARDMEMBER

PRESENTS THE CARD FOR PAYMENT, THE MERCHANT CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR THE

TRANSACTION AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT. THE MERCHANT

DISCOUNT IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM PAYMENT TO THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT WHERE

TRS IS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE

TIME THE TRANSACTION IS CAPTURED. WHERE WE ACT AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE

CARD PRESENTED AT A MERCHANT IS ISSUED BY A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF SOME OF OUR GNS PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS, WE

WILL MAKE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT TO THE MERCHANT AND RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT REVENUE.

WE WILL ALSO RECEIVE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT FROM THE CARD ISSUER, WHO RECEIVES AN

ISSUER RATE (I.E., THE AMOUNT THAT CARD ISSUERS RECEIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS CHARGED

ON OUR NETWORK WITH CARDS THAT THEY ISSUE, WHICH IS USUALLY EXPRESSED AS A

PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGED AMOUNT). THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT REVENUE

AND THE ISSUER RATE GENERATES A RETURN TO THE NETWORK. WHERE WE ARE THE CARD

ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION,

WE RECEIVE AN ISSUER RATE IN OUR SETTLEMENT WITH THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER.

10

THE LEVEL OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE THAT WE CHARGE IS PRINCIPALLY

DETERMINED BY THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO THE MERCHANT AND GENERALLY REPRESENTS

A PREMIUM OVER OTHER CARD NETWORKS. WE DELIVER VALUE TO THE MERCHANT THROUGH

HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS RELATIVE TO CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETING CARD NETWORKS,

THE OVERALL HIGHER VOLUME OF SPENDING BY ALL CARDMEMBERS, MARKETING PROGRAMS AND

THE INSISTENCE OF CARDMEMBERS TO USE THEIR CARDS WHEN ENROLLED IN REWARDS OR

OTHER CARD LOYALTY PROGRAMS.

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE VARIES WITH THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE MERCHANT

DOES BUSINESS, THE CHARGE VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT TO THE

MERCHANT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE

SCOPE OF THE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH US (LOCAL OR GLOBAL), AND THE

AVERAGE CHARGE AMOUNT. IN 2004, AS IN PRIOR YEARS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME

REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF STRONGER THAN AVERAGE GROWTH IN THE LOWER RATE

"EVERYDAY SPEND" MERCHANT CATEGORIES. BASED ON OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE EXPECT

TO SEE CONTINUED CHANGES IN THE MIX OF BUSINESS. THIS, ALONG WITH VOLUME-RELATED

PRICING DISCOUNTS AND SELECTIVE REPRICING INITIATIVES, WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO

RESULT IN SOME EROSION OVER TIME OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE.

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE ANNOUNCED A NUMBER OF

INCREASES IN THEIR U.S. CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE RATES, WHICH CAN INCREASE THE

COST TO MERCHANTS OF ACCEPTING VISA AND MASTERCARD CARDS.

WHILE MOST MERCHANTS UNDERSTAND OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE PRICING IN

RELATION TO THE VALUE PROVIDED, WE DO ENCOUNTER A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, BUT TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER TO

ACCEPT ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT AND, CONSEQUENTLY, SUPPRESS USE OF THE CARD. WE

DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE. WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS BY.

CONCENTRATING ON ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD;

CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE PROVIDE BY PROGRAMS SUCH AS "AMERICAN EXPRESS

SELECTS", WHICH ENABLES MERCHANTS TO GAIN VALUABLE EXPOSURE AND ADDITIONAL SALES

BY MAKING ONLINE OFFERS, SUCH AS DISCOUNTS ON PURCHASES AVAILABLE TO CARDMEMBERS

ON A WEB SITE MAINTAINED BY US; PROVIDING BETTER AND EARLIER COMMUNICATION OF

OUR VALUE PROPOSITION; AND WHEN NECESSARY, BY CANCELING MERCHANTS WHO SUPPRESS

THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

MERCHANT SATISFACTION IS A KEY GOAL OF OUR GLOBAL ESTABLISHMENT SERVICES

BUSINESS. WE FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE

MERCHANT SATISFACTION, EXECUTING PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS

AND STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS THROUGH AN EXPANDING ROSTER

OF SERVICES THAT HELP THEM MEET THEIR BUSINESS GOALS. WE OFFER A FULL RANGE OF

POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING TERMINALS, INTEGRATED POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS

AND DIRECT LINKS THAT ALLOW OUR MERCHANT PARTNERS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS

CARDS, AS WELL AS BANKCARDS, DEBIT CARDS AND CHECKS. ALL PROPRIETARY

POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS SUPPORT DIRECT PROCESSING (I.E., DIRECT CONNECTIVITY) TO

AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH LOWERS A MERCHANT'S COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE AND AVOIDS

ANY PAYMENT DELAYS CAUSED BY A THIRD PARTY. DURING 2004, WE ALSO LAUNCHED

BUSINESS SAVINGS FOR ALL U.S. MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS,

WHICH PROVIDES THEM WITH WAYS TO REDUCE EXPENSES FOR OFFICE SUPPLIES, CELLULAR

PHONE SERVICE, TEMPORARY STAFFING AND SHIPPING THROUGH PRE-NEGOTIATED DISCOUNTS

AT SELECT PARTNERS.

11

WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE FAST-GROWING RECURRING BILLING INDUSTRY THROUGH

THE AUTOMATED BILL PAYMENT PLATFORM, A PRODUCT THAT ALLOWS MERCHANTS TO BILL

CARDMEMBERS ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR RECURRING CHARGES SUCH AS INSURANCE PREMIUMS,

NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTIONS, HEALTH CLUB MEMBERSHIPS, COMMUTATION COSTS AND CABLE TV

SERVICE. WE HAVE ALSO MADE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR HOST AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM TO

APPROVE MORE TRANSACTIONS AND REDUCE CARDMEMBER INCONVENIENCE AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN FRAUD OR CREDIT LOSSES.

WHEREVER WE MANAGE BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS AND THE

CARD-ISSUING SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A "CLOSED LOOP," WHICH DISTINGUISHES

OUR NETWORK FROM THE BANKCARD NETWORKS IN THAT THERE IS ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT

BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD TRANSACTION. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING

FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS,

SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CARD ISSUING

BANK PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS CLOSED LOOP, WHICH PERMITS THEM

TO CUSTOMIZE MARKETING EFFORTS, DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO THEIR CARDMEMBERS AND

HELP US TO DIRECT INCREASED BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT THE CARD.

AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WE HAVE CERTAIN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES THAT

ARISE IF A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS SETTLED IN

FAVOR OF THE CARDMEMBER. DRIVERS OF THIS LIABILITY ARE RETURNS IN THE NORMAL

COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER FRAUDULENT CHARGES, THE QUALITY OR

NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, WE OFFSET THE

AMOUNT DUE TO THE CARDMEMBER AGAINST THE MERCHANT'S CURRENT OR FUTURE

SUBMISSIONS FOR PAYMENT. WE CAN REALIZE LOSSES WHEN OFFSETTING SUBMISSIONS

CEASE, SUCH AS WHEN THE MERCHANT COMMENCES A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR GOES OUT

OF BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE RISK OF THIS

EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE TO A

GIVEN MERCHANT BY EITHER HOLDING CASH RESERVES FUNDED THROUGH CASH HOLDBACKS

FROM A MERCHANT OR LENGTHENING THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE MERCHANT SUBMITS A

CHARGE FOR PAYMENT AND WHEN WE PAY THE MERCHANT. WE ALSO ESTABLISH RESERVES ON

OUR BALANCE SHEET FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES.

IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, THIRD PARTY PROCESSORS AND SOME BANKCARD ACQUIRERS HAVE BEGUN TO OFFER

MERCHANTS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVERTING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE LOCAL

CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF THE CARDHOLDER'S RESIDENCE (I.E., THE CARDHOLDER'S

BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE POINT-OF-SALE, AND SUBMITTING THE TRANSACTION IN THE

CARDHOLDER'S BILLING CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY

CONVERSION PROCESS OF THE CARD NETWORK. THIS PRACTICE IS KNOWN AS "DYNAMIC

CURRENCY CONVERSION." IF A MERCHANT UTILIZES A DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION

PROCESS, THE MERCHANT AND PROCESSOR SHARE ANY FEE ASSESSED OR SPREAD EARNED FOR

CONVERTING THE TRANSACTION AT THE POINT OF SALE, THUS REDUCING OR ELIMINATING

REVENUE FOR CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION OF FOREIGN

CHARGES TO THE CARDHOLDER'S BILLING CURRENCY. THIS PRACTICE IS NOT WIDESPREAD,

AND IT IS UNCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT CONSUMERS WILL PREFER TO HAVE FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS CONVERTED BY MERCHANTS IN THIS WAY. OUR POLICY GENERALLY

REQUIRES MERCHANTS TO SUBMIT CHARGES AND BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY

IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND WE CONVERT THE TRANSACTION TO THE

CARDMEMBER'S BILLING CURRENCY. WE ARE REVIEWING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF DYNAMIC

CURRENCY CONVERSION, INCLUDING CONSIDERING WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT WE SHOULD

DEVELOP OUR OWN DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS.

12

REGULATION

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES

INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE FEES MERCHANTS

ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPEAN UNION,

AUSTRALIA, MEXICO AND SWITZERLAND, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED, AND ARE

CONTINUING TO CONDUCT, INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE WAY BANKCARD NETWORK MEMBERS

COLLECTIVELY SET THE "INTERCHANGE," WHICH IS THE FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD

MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD-ISSUING BANK. THE INTERCHANGE FEE IS GENERALLY THE

LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS BY THE

MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR BANKCARD CHARGES. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS' FOCUS HAS

PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS, GOVERNMENT

REGULATION OF THE BANKCARD ASSOCIATIONS' PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL

CARD SERVICE PROVIDERS BY REQUIRING REDUCTION OF THE LEVELS OF INTERCHANGE,

WHICH WILL DRIVE DOWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES. DOWNWARD MOVEMENT OF INTERCHANGE

AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT FEES MAY AFFECT THE RELATIVE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO

CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS OF PARTICIPATION IN A PARTICULAR NETWORK.

LOSS OF MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD SERVICE PROVIDERS TO LOOK FOR

OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS ANNUAL CARD FEES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY

SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS. REDUCTIONS IN BANKCARD INTERCHANGE

MANDATED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA IN 2003 HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER

MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR VISA AND MASTERCARD. AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE

MARKETPLACE, WE HAVE REDUCED OUR OWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES IN AUSTRALIA

ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE STRONG ECONOMICS IN THAT MARKET. IN

ADDITION, UNDER LEGISLATION RECENTLY ENACTED IN ARGENTINA, A MERCHANT ACQUIRER

IS REQUIRED TO CHARGE THE SAME MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE TO ALL MERCHANTS IN THE

SAME INDUSTRY CATEGORY, AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES CANNOT EXCEED 3%. IN THE

EVENT GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE CONTINUES OR

INCREASES, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

REGULATORS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED THE INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF PROHIBITING

MERCHANTS FROM PASSING THE COST OF MERCHANT DISCOUNT FEES ALONG TO CONSUMERS

THROUGH SURCHARGES ON CARD PURCHASES. ALTHOUGH SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE

UNITED KINGDOM, AND MORE RECENTLY, AUSTRALIA, PERMIT MERCHANTS TO LEVY A

SURCHARGE ON CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, THERE HAS BEEN A RELATIVELY LOW INCIDENCE OF

SURCHARGING, AS MERCHANTS DO NOT WANT TO RISK OFFENDING CUSTOMERS OR LOSING

CUSTOMERS TO THOSE COMPETITORS THAT DO NOT ASSESS SURCHARGES FOR CREDIT CARD

PURCHASES.

CONSUMER CARD, SMALL BUSINESS AND CONSUMER TRAVEL SERVICES

AS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF ITS PROPRIETARY CARD ISSUING BUSINESS, TRS ISSUES

A WIDE RANGE OF CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO

SMALL BUSINESSES PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR CONSUMER TRAVEL BUSINESS,

WHICH PROVIDES TRAVEL SERVICES TO CARDMEMBERS AND OTHER CONSUMERS, COMPLEMENTS

OUR CARD BUSINESS. THE PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS OFFERS A BROAD SET OF CARD

PRODUCTS TO ATTRACT A GREATER NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. CORE ELEMENTS OF OUR STRATEGY

ARE.

-     FOCUSING ON ACQUIRING AND RETAINING HIGH-SPENDING, CREDITWORTHY

CARDMEMBERS ACROSS MULTIPLE GROUPS;

-     DESIGNING CARD PRODUCTS WITH FEATURES THAT APPEAL TO SPECIFIC

CUSTOMER SEGMENTS;

-     THE USE OF STRONG INCENTIVES TO DRIVE SPENDING ON OUR VARIOUS CARD

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS(R) PROGRAM AND OTHER

REWARDS FEATURES;

13

-     THE USE OF LOYALTY PROGRAMS SUCH AS DELTA SKYMILES, SPONSORED BY OUR

COBRAND AND OTHER PARTNERS TO DRIVE SPENDING;

-     THE DEVELOPMENT AND NURTURING OF WIDE-RANGING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

COBRAND AND OTHER PARTNERS;

-     A MULTI-CARD STRATEGY (HAVING MULTIPLE CARD PRODUCTS IN CUSTOMERS'

WALLETS); AND

-     HIGH-QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE.

WE AND OUR LICENSEES OFFER INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER CHARGE CARDS SUCH AS THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) GOLD CARD, THE PLATINUM CARD(R),

AND THE ULTRA-PREMIUM CENTURION(R) CARD; REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS SUCH AS BLUE

FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS(R), BLUE CASH(R) FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THE OPTIMA(R)

CARD, AMONG OTHERS; AND A VARIETY OF CARDS SPONSORED BY AND COBRANDED WITH OTHER

CORPORATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE DELTA SKYMILES(R) CREDIT CARD FROM

AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) PLATINUM CASH REBATE CARD AND TRUE

EARNINGS CARD EXCLUSIVELY FOR COSTCO MEMBERS AND THE HILTON HHONORS PLATINUM

CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS.

CHARGE CARDS

OUR CHARGE CARDS, WHICH ARE MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER

COUNTRIES AND CARRY NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A

METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR

SERVICES. CHARGES ARE APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A

CARDMEMBER'S ACCOUNT HISTORY, CREDIT RECORD AND PERSONAL RESOURCES. CARDMEMBERS

GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH, AND NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE

ASSESSED. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO

A DELINQUENCY ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE CANCELED.

THE NO-PRESET-SPENDING LIMIT AND PAY-IN-FULL NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS ATTRACT

HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS WHO WANT TO USE A CHARGE CARD TO FACILITATE LARGER

PAYMENTS.

THE SIGN & TRAVEL PROGRAM GIVES QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF

EXTENDED PAYMENTS FOR AIRLINE, CRUISE AND CERTAIN TRAVEL CHARGES THAT ARE

PURCHASED WITH OUR CHARGE CARDS. THE EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION OFFERS QUALIFIED

U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDING PAYMENT FOR CERTAIN CHARGES ON THE

CHARGE CARD IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED AMOUNT. VARIOUS FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS

ARE OFFERED TO CARDMEMBERS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AS WELL.

REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS

TRS AND ITS LICENSEES ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS IN

THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE CARDS HAVE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT

PAYMENT TERMS, GRACE PERIODS AND RATE AND FEE STRUCTURES. SINCE LATE 1994, WHEN

WE BEGAN AGGRESSIVELY TO EXPAND OUR CREDIT CARD BUSINESS, OUR LENDING BALANCE

GROWTH HAS BEEN AMONG THE TOP TIER OF CARD ISSUERS. MUCH OF THIS GROWTH HAS BEEN

DUE TO THE BREADTH OF OUR LENDING PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS,

BLUE CASH FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THE DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN

EXPRESS, AS WELL AS THE INCREASED NUMBER OF CHARGE CARDMEMBERS WHO HAVE TAKEN

ADVANTAGE OF OUR "LENDING ON CHARGE" OPTIONS (SUCH AS THE SIGN & TRAVEL(R) AND

EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION PROGRAMS DESCRIBED ABOVE).

14

AMONG OTHER PRODUCTS INTRODUCED IN 2004, WE LAUNCHED THE IN:NYC CARD, A

FEE-FREE CREDIT CARD THAT HELPS CARDMEMBERS GET THE MOST OUT OF NEW YORK CITY BY

PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE OFFERS FOR CARDMEMBERS AND DOUBLE POINTS THROUGH A UNIQUE

LOYALTY PROGRAM, INSIDE REWARDS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB AS ISSUERS OF

CERTAIN CARDS

OUR REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE ISSUED BY AMERICAN

EXPRESS CENTURION BANK ("CENTURION BANK"), AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB

("AEBFSB"), EACH OF WHICH IS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN EXPRESS

TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. CENTURION BANK ISSUES BLUE FROM AMERICAN

EXPRESS, BLUE CASH FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE OPTIMA CARD, AND CERTAIN OTHER

AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN

ADDITION, CENTURION BANK HAS OUTSTANDING LINES OF CREDIT IN ASSOCIATION WITH

CERTAIN CHARGE CARDS AND OFFERS UNSECURED LOANS TO CARDMEMBERS IN CONNECTION

WITH THE SIGN & TRAVEL AND EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION PROGRAMS. CENTURION BANK IS

ALSO THE ISSUER OF CERTAIN CHARGE CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2004, AEBFSB ACQUIRED CERTAIN CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS AND RECEIVABLES FROM

CENTURION BANK AND TRS AND HOME EQUITY LOANS, DEPOSITS AND OTHER LENDING

PORTFOLIOS FROM CENTURION BANK. IN ADDITION, AEBFSB BECAME THE ISSUING BANK OF

THE RELATED AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING THE

CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT CARDS COBRANDED WITH DELTA AIR LINES AND

COSTCO WHOLESALE AND CERTAIN CHARGE CARDS ISSUED TO SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS.

INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS

TRS CONTINUED TO BOLSTER ITS INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS

THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF MORE THAN 80 NEW OR ENHANCED CARD PRODUCTS DURING 2004.

THESE ARE CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, EITHER ON OUR OWN OR, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW,

AS COBRANDS WITH PARTNERING INSTITUTIONS. THIS PAST YEAR, AMONG OTHER NEW

PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE INTRODUCED.

-     CENTURION CARDS IN THE NETHERLANDS, SWEDEN, FRANCE, ITALY, SPAIN AND

AUSTRALIA;

-     A PLATINUM CARD IN AUSTRIA;

-     A NEW AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CARD IN THAILAND; AND

-     NEW PLATINUM CREDIT CARDS IN THE PHILIPPINES, PUERTO RICO, SINGAPORE

AND TAIWAN.

COBRAND CARDS

TRS ISSUES CARDS UNDER COBRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS

BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. EXAMPLES OF NEW OR ENHANCED

COBRAND PRODUCTS INTRODUCED IN 2004 INCLUDE.

-     AGREEMENTS WITH COSTCO WHOLESALE TO ISSUE THE TRUE EARNINGS CARD FOR

CONSUMERS AND THE TRUE EARNINGS BUSINESS CARD FOR SMALL BUSINESSES;

-     A COBRANDED CREDIT CARD WITH BMW IN THAILAND;

15

-     A COBRANDED CHARGE CARD WITH HOTEL OKURA CO., LTD., FEATURING THE

OKURA CLUB POINT PROGRAM; AND

-     A COBRANDED CREDIT CARD WITH INDIAN AIRLINES.

DURING 2004, WE ALSO EXTENDED OUR EXISTING COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE UNITED

STATES WITH TWO OF OUR LARGEST COBRAND PARTNERS, DELTA AIR LINES AND COSTCO

WHOLESALE.

THE COMPETITION AMONG CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS FOR ATTRACTIVE COBRAND

CARD PARTNERSHIPS IS QUITE INTENSE BECAUSE THEY CAN GENERATE HIGH-SPENDING LOYAL

CARDHOLDERS. THE DURATION OF OUR COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGE FROM FIVE

TO TEN YEARS. CARDMEMBERS EARN REWARDS PROVIDED BY THE PARTNERS' RESPECTIVE

LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR SPENDING ON THE COBRAND CARDS, SUCH AS

FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY POINTS AND CASH BACK. WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO

OUR COBRAND PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF

CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER

CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. WE

EXPENSE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MONTH EARNED. PAYMENT

TERMS VARY BY ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. ONCE WE MAKE PAYMENT TO

THE COBRAND PARTNER, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PARTNER IS SOLELY LIABLE WITH

RESPECT TO PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE COBRAND PARTNER'S OWN

LOYALTY PROGRAM. AS THE ISSUER OF THE COBRAND CARD, WE RETAIN ALL THE CREDIT

RISK WITH THE CARDMEMBER AND BEAR THE RECEIVABLES FUNDING AND OPERATING EXPENSES

WITH RESPECT TO SUCH CARDS. THE COBRAND PARTNER RETAINS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

THE MILES, POINTS OR OTHER CURRENCY EARNED BY THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE PARTNER'S

LOYALTY PROGRAM.

BANK DISTRIBUTION OF PROPRIETARY CARDS

WE ALSO ISSUE CARDS UNDER DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS, PRIMARILY

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SUCH BANK DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS INVOLVE THE

OFFERING OF A STANDARD PRODUCT (ISSUED BY TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) TO

CUSTOMERS OF THE BANK, GENERALLY WITH THE BANK'S LOGO ON THE CARD. IN A BANK

DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENT, WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE BANK PARTNERS THAT ARE

PRIMARILY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED THROUGH THE

ARRANGEMENT AND THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON SUCH CARDS. THE DURATION OF

SUCH ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS.

WE ALSO SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO DISTRIBUTE AMERICAN EXPRESS PLATINUM AND

GOLD CARDS TO CUSTOMERS OF BANCO BANIF, THE PRIVATE BANKING DIVISION OF GRUPO

SANTANDER IN SPAIN, AND A DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH ALANDSBANKEN IN FINLAND TO

DISTRIBUTE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED PRODUCTS AS PART OF THAT BANK'S NEW PREMIUM

SERVICE.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS IS AFFINITY CARDS WITH

FRATERNAL, PROFESSIONAL, EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WE

HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PENETRATING THE AFFINITY CARD SEGMENT IN AUSTRALIA,

WHERE WE ISSUE CARDS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGEST PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS

IN THAT COUNTRY. IN AUSTRALIA, AFFINITY CARDS ARE A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR

TOTAL REVOLVING PORTFOLIO AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR PROPRIETARY CONSUMER LENDING

ACTIVITIES.

16

CARD PRICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

CERTAIN OF OUR CARDS, PARTICULARLY CHARGE CARDS, CHARGE AN ANNUAL FEE THAT

VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD, THE NUMBER OF CARDS FOR EACH ACCOUNT, THE

CURRENCY IN WHICH THE CARD IS DENOMINATED AND THE COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE OF THE

CARDMEMBER. WE ALSO OFFER MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS WITH NO ANNUAL FEE BUT ON

WHICH WE ASSESS FINANCE CHARGES FOR REVOLVING BALANCES. DEPENDING ON THE

PRODUCT, WE ALSO CHARGE CARDMEMBER FEES TO PARTICIPATE IN REWARDS PROGRAMS, IN

RESPECT OF ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE (E.G., LATE FEES) OR FOR CERTAIN SERVICES (E.G.,

ADDITIONAL COPIES OF ACCOUNT STATEMENTS). WE APPLY STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR

CREDITWORTHINESS TO EACH CARDMEMBER THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS BOTH AT THE TIME

OF INITIAL SOLICITATION OR APPLICATION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING THE CARD

RELATIONSHIP. WE USE SOPHISTICATED CREDIT MODELS AND TECHNIQUES IN OUR RISK

MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS AND BELIEVE THAT OUR STRONG RISK MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES

PROVIDE US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS(R) PROGRAM

DURING 2004, WE ALSO CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR U.S. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM - - THE LARGEST PROGRAM OF ITS KIND. CUSTOMERS ENROLLED IN THE

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM EARN POINTS TOWARD A VARIETY OF TRAVEL,

ENTERTAINMENT, AND RETAIL REWARDS. CUSTOMERS EARN ONE POINT FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY

DOLLAR THEY SPEND. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE AS LONG AS

THE CUSTOMER MAINTAINS A MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNT WITH AN ELIGIBLE, ENROLLED

CARD. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF POINTS EARNED, AND BONUS POINT

OPPORTUNITIES HELP OUR CUSTOMERS EARN REWARDS FASTER. WE CONTINUED TO ADD NEW

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PARTNERS TO THE U.S. PROGRAM, INCLUDING JETBLUE AIRWAYS,

FAIRMONT HOTELS, WYNDHAM HOTELS AND RESORTS, BLOOMINGDALE'S, RESTORATION

HARDWARE AND BENIHANA. OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE AN

IMPORTANT DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND LOYALTY.

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, REWARDS PROGRAMS ARE A STRONG DRIVER OF

CARDMEMBER SPENDING IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER BUSINESS. WE HAVE OVER 1,200

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PARTNERS THAT PARTICIPATE IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAMS WITH AN AVERAGE OF 70 PARTNERS IN EACH COUNTRY; FEWER THAN 30%

OF THESE PARTNERS ARE IN THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. CARDMEMBERS CAN REDEEM THEIR

POINTS WITH 35 AIRLINES AND OVER 275 HOTEL CHAINS. OUR NON-TRAVEL REDEMPTION

OPTIONS INCLUDE RETAIL - RANGING FROM THE GAP TO TAKASHIMAYA, AN UPSCALE

JAPANESE DEPARTMENT STORE. OTHER REDEMPTION CATEGORIES INCLUDE DINING, SPAS,

CHARITIES, MOVIE THEATRES, AUTOMOBILES, AND SPECIAL EVENTS LIKE THE MTV MUSIC

VIDEO AWARDS IN EUROPE. IN 2004, WE SIGNED 50 NEW MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PARTNERS

AND CONTINUED TO ENHANCE OUR REWARDS PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL MARKETS, OFFERING MORE

FLEXIBLE CHOICES THAT ENABLE CARDMEMBERS TO REDEEM POINTS MORE QUICKLY. IN THIS

VEIN, DURING 2004 WE LAUNCHED THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS DIRECT TICKET IN NEW

ZEALAND, WHICH LOWERED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY CARDMEMBERS NEED TO SPEND IN ORDER TO

EARN FREE TRAVEL AND ALLOWS THE CARDMEMBER TO REDEEM POINTS DIRECTLY WITH US TO

PURCHASE A TRAVEL AWARD RATHER THAN HAVING TO FIRST TRANSFER POINTS TO A

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PARTNER. WE LAUNCHED DOUBLE POINTS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS IN

INDONESIA AND AN ENHANCED MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM IN JAPAN THAT ALLOWS

CARDMEMBERS TO CARRY OVER THEIR EARNED MEMBERSHIP PLUS POINTS INDEFINITELY.

WHEN A CARDMEMBER ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM USES THE

CARD, WE ESTABLISH BALANCE SHEET RESERVES IN CONNECTION WITH ESTIMATED FUTURE

REWARD REDEMPTIONS. WHEN A MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ENROLLEE REDEEMS A REWARD

USING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS, WE MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM PARTNER PROVIDING THE

17

REWARD PURSUANT TO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. BECAUSE OF HIGHER CHARGE VOLUMES

AND GREATER REDEMPTION RATES, THE EXPENSE OF THE PROGRAM HAS INCREASED BOTH IN

THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND CONTINUES

TO GROW. DESPITE THE INCREASING COSTS OF MEMBERSHIP REWARDS AS PENETRATION AND

USAGE EXPAND, THIS PROGRAM PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN OUR PROFITABILITY. WE BELIEVE,

BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THAT CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS AND COBRAND

PROGRAMS YIELD HIGHER SPEND, BETTER RETENTION, STRONGER CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND

GREATER PROFIT FOR US. BY OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES, WE

HAVE IMPROVED CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM AND

LOWERED OUR AVERAGE COST PER POINT. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO CONTAIN THE OVERALL

COST OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS.

CARDMEMBER SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, CARDMEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF FREE AND

SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE

WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND

INTERNATIONALLY, IN OUR CARD SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW FASTER

INTRODUCTION AND GREATER CUSTOMIZATION OF PRODUCTS. WE ALSO ARE USING TECHNOLOGY

TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICE CAPABILITIES TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER A HIGH

QUALITY CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAINTAIN A SERVICE DELIVERY

PLATFORM THAT OUR EMPLOYEES USE IN THE CARD BUSINESS TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF

CUSTOMER SERVICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ACCOUNT

MAINTENANCE, UPDATING OF CARDMEMBER INFORMATION, THE ADDITION OF NEW CARDS TO AN

ACCOUNT AND RESOLVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ISSUES. IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE

ARE BUILDING FLEXIBILITY AND ENHANCING OUR GLOBAL PLATFORMS AND CAPABILITIES IN

REVOLVING CREDIT, OUR FULL SERVICE BANKING PLATFORM CALLED IWEALTHVIEW, AND

CONSUMER PAYMENT OPTIONS. YOU CAN FIND A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ARRANGEMENT

REGARDING THE OUTSOURCING OF MANY OF OUR TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS TO IBM IN THE

"CORPORATE AND OTHER" SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

WE CONTINUED TO LEVERAGE THE INTERNET TO LOWER COSTS AND IMPROVE SERVICE

QUALITY. DURING 2004, WE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF SERVICES AND CAPABILITIES

AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS ONLINE AND INCREASED THEIR UTILIZATION. FOR EXAMPLE,

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 90% OF OUR CARD SERVICING CALL VOLUME

CAN NOW BE HANDLED ONLINE. WE NOW HAVE MORE ONLINE INTERACTIONS WITH U.S.

CUSTOMERS THAN WE DO BY TELEPHONE OR IN PERSON. OUR ONLINE CARD SALES GREW

STEADILY IN 2004 AS WELL.

AT YEAR-END, CUSTOMERS ENROLLED APPROXIMATELY 15 MILLION CARDS IN OUR

"MANAGE YOUR CARD ACCOUNT SERVICE." THIS SERVICE ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO REVIEW

AND PAY THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS BILLS ELECTRONICALLY, VIEW AND SERVICE THEIR

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ACCOUNTS AND CONDUCT VARIOUS OTHER FUNCTIONS QUICKLY

AND SECURELY ONLINE. WE NOW HAVE AN ONLINE PRESENCE IN 48 MARKETS.

OPEN: THE SMALL BUSINESS NETWORK(SM) FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS

ALSO A LEADING PROVIDER OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO SMALL BUSINESSES (FIRMS THAT

GENERALLY HAVE LESS THAN 100 EMPLOYEES AND/OR SALES OF $10 MILLION OR LESS), A

MANAGEMENT REPORTS, IMPROVED INFORMATION CONCERNING CATEGORIES OF SPEND AND

LIMITS ON SUPPLEMENTAL CARDS (THE ABILITY TO SET A SPENDING LIMIT ON CARDS

ISSUED ON A CARDMEMBER'S ACCOUNT TO PERSONS AUTHORIZED BY THE CARDMEMBER).

19

IN 2004, WE SOLD THE LEASING PRODUCT LINE OF OPEN'S SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING

UNIT, AMERICAN EXPRESS BUSINESS FINANCE CORPORATION, WITH A LOAN PORTFOLIO OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK -- USA

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK -- USA PROVIDES TRAVEL,

FINANCIAL AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS-OWNED

TRAVEL SERVICE OFFICES, CALL CENTERS AND PARTICIPATING AMERICAN EXPRESS

REPRESENTATIVES (INDEPENDENTLY-OWNED TRAVEL AGENCY LOCATIONS THAT OPERATE UNDER

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND). U.S. CONSUMER TRAVEL HAS DISTINGUISHED ITSELF IN

THE LUXURY MARKETPLACE THROUGH ITS PLATINUM TRAVEL SERVICES AND CENTURION TRAVEL

SERVICES, WHICH PROVIDE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE PROGRAM,

WHICH OFFERS TWO-FOR-ONE FARES ON INTERNATIONAL FIRST AND BUSINESS CLASS

TICKETS, AND THE FINE HOTELS & RESORTS PROGRAM, A LUXURY HOTEL PROGRAM OFFERING

ROOM UPGRADES AND VALUE-ADDED AMENITIES. OTHER PREMIUM PROGRAMS DEVELOPED BY

CONSUMER TRAVEL FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARDMEMBERS INCLUDE CRUISE

PRIVILEGES, CENTURION AND PLATINUM DESTINATIONS VACATIONS AND THE PRIVATE JETS

PROGRAM.

IN ADDITION, THE CONSUMER TRAVEL BUSINESS OPERATES A WHOLESALE TRAVEL

BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. (A WHOLESALER PURCHASES INVENTORY, SUCH AS HOTEL

ROOMS OR AIRLINE SEATS, FROM SUPPLIERS AND THEN RESELLS THE SERVICES TO THE

CUSTOMER AT RETAIL PRICES THAT THE WHOLESALER DETERMINES.) OUR WHOLESALE TRAVEL

BUSINESS PACKAGES AMERICAN EXPRESS VACATIONS AND DISTRIBUTES TRAVEL PACKAGES

THROUGH OTHER RETAIL TRAVEL AGENTS, AND A CRUISE SUBSIDIARY IN THE UNITED

STATES, WHICH MARKETS VALUE-ADDED CRUISE PRODUCTS CALLED THE MARINER'S CLUB.

CONSUMER TRAVEL ALSO PROVIDES MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM CRUISE AND TOUR

FULFILLMENT, FEE-FREE AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELERS CHEQUES, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

SERVICES.

IN 2004, WE ENHANCED OUR CONSUMER TRAVEL WEB SITE WITH PRIVATE-LABEL

VERSIONS OF THE TRAVELOCITY INC. BOOKING SERVICE FOR AIR, HOTEL AND CAR RENTAL

RESERVATIONS, AND A PRIVATE-LABEL ONLINE CRUISE BOOKING SERVICE FROM

OURVACATIONSTORE.COM. OUR WEB SITE NOW OFFERS CONSUMERS FARES AND RATES THAT ARE

COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER LEADING TRAVEL WEB SITES, ALONG WITH VALUE-ADDED BENEFITS

FOR CARDMEMBERS, INCLUDING DOUBLE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS.

WE ALSO ATTRACTED 13 NEW MEMBERS LAST YEAR TO OUR REPRESENTATIVE NETWORK,

INCLUDING CRUISE PLANNER, INC., THE FIRST CRUISE FRANCHISER TO JOIN THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS TRAVEL NETWORK.

TRS' WORLDWIDE TRAVEL NETWORK OF MORE THAN 1,700 RETAIL TRAVEL LOCATIONS

IS IMPORTANT IN SUPPORTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND PROVIDING CUSTOMER

SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

COMPETITION

OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INTENSE

COMPETITION. AS A CARD ISSUER, WE COMPETE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIBANK, BANK OF AMERICA, JPMORGAN CHASE, MBNA AND

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL) THAT ARE MEMBERS OF VISA AND/OR MASTERCARD AND THAT ISSUE

GENERAL PURPOSE CREDIT CARDS, PRIMARILY UNDER REVOLVING CREDIT PLANS, ON ONE OR

BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS, AND THE MORGAN STANLEY AFFILIATE THAT ISSUES THE DISCOVER

CARD

20

ON THE DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES NETWORK. INTERNATIONALLY, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT

TO COMPETITION FROM MULTINATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS CITIBANK, HSBC AND BANCO

SANTANDER, AS WELL AS MANY LOCAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. GLOBALLY, WE

VIEW CITIBANK AND HSBC AS OUR STRONGEST COMPETITORS AS THEY OFFER CARD PRODUCTS

IN A LARGE NUMBER OF MARKETS. WE ALSO ENCOUNTER LIMITED COMPETITION FROM

BUSINESSES THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR

CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS ARE

NOT GENERALLY SUBSTITUTES FOR OUR CARDS BECAUSE OF THEIR LIMITED ACCEPTANCE. AS

A RESULT OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES

COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE

ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS AND THE LARGEST ISSUERS HAVE

CONTINUED TO GROW USING THEIR GREATER RESOURCES, ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND BRAND

RECOGNITION TO COMPETE.

COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT

CARDHOLDERS INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT,

AIRLINE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS, CASH REBATES AND OTHER REWARD OR

REBATE PROGRAMS, "TEASER" PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CREDIT CARD

ACQUISITION AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND COBRANDED ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT

OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS.

MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ALSO ISSUE

DEBIT CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR

POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED

ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE VISA OR MASTERCARD

LOGO. AS A RESULT, THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE

UNITED STATES HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AND, IN THE UNITED STATES,

HAS GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS. DEBIT CARDS ARE

MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH AND CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT

CARDS ARE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS. WHILE DEBIT CARDS MAY BE USED

INSTEAD OF CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF TRANSACTIONS, THE

ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE DEBIT CARDS FOR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS IS LIMITED BECAUSE

THE CONSUMER MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN HIS OR HER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TO

COVER THE TRANSACTION IN QUESTION. FOR EXAMPLE, LARGER PURCHASES OR DELAYED

PURCHASES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR DEBIT CARDS. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ISSUE

POINT-OF-SALE DEBIT CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT NETWORK.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS

ARE.

-     THE FEATURES AND THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING REWARDS

PROGRAMS, PROVIDED TO CARDMEMBERS;

-     THE NUMBER, SPENDING CHARACTERISTICS AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF

CARDMEMBERS;

-     THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT A CARD;

-     THE COST OF CARDS TO CARDMEMBERS;

-     PRICING, PAYMENT AND OTHER CARD ACCOUNT TERMS AND CONDITIONS;

-     THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF OTHER PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO

CARDMEMBERS;

-     THE NATURE AND QUALITY OF EXPENSE MANAGEMENT DATA CAPTURE AND

REPORTING CAPABILITY;

-     THE SUCCESS OF TARGETED MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS;

-     REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION;

-     THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS TO IMPLEMENT OPERATIONAL AND COST

EFFICIENCIES; AND

-     THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

21

AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL "BRICK AND

MORTAR" TRAVEL AGENTS, ONLINE TRAVEL AGENTS AND TRAVEL SUPPLIERS THAT DISTRIBUTE

THEIR PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS DIRECTLY VIA THE INTERNET OR TELEPHONE-BASED

CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTERS. IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASING

COMPETITION FROM ONLINE TRAVEL AGENTS UTILIZING THE MERCHANT BUSINESS MODEL

UNDER WHICH THE AGENT RECEIVES INVENTORY (HOTEL ROOMS, AIRLINE SEATS, CAR

RENTALS, DESTINATION SERVICES) FROM SUPPLIERS AT NEGOTIATED RATES. THE AGENT

THEN DETERMINES THE RETAIL PRICE PAID BY THE CUSTOMER AND PROCESSES THE

TRANSACTIONS AS THE MERCHANT OF RECORD FOR THE TRANSACTION. WE BELIEVE THE

MERCHANT MODEL WAS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE DURING THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS WHEN TRAVEL VOLUMES WERE DEPRESSED AND

SUPPLIERS TENDED TO MAKE GREATER AMOUNTS OF THEIR INVENTORY AVAILABLE TO

AGENCIES UTILIZING THIS MODEL.

NEW COMPETITION HAS ALSO EMERGED IN THE PAST YEAR IN THE FORM OF SEVERAL

SOFTWARE COMPANIES THAT OFFER ROBOTIC SEARCHES OF OTHER WEB SITES TO DIRECT

CONSUMERS TO THE SITE THAT OFFERS THE LOWEST PRICES ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOMER'S

SEARCH PARAMETERS.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TRS,

ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES ("CREDCO"), PURCHASES THE MAJORITY OF CHARGE CARD

RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE USE OF CARDS ISSUED IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN

CERTAIN CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO FINANCES THE PURCHASE OF

RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE SALE OF

MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB FINANCE THEIR REVOLVING

CREDIT RECEIVABLES THROUGH THE SALE OF SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT IN THE UNITED STATES. TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB

ALSO FUND RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS. THE COST OF FUNDING

CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR EXPENSE OF CARD OPERATIONS. (YOU CAN

FIND A DISCUSSION OF TRS' AND CENTURION BANK'S SECURITIZATION AND OTHER

FINANCING ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 26-27, PAGE 35, PAGES 37-40, PAGE 41, PAGES 45-47,

AND PAGES 51-56 UNDER THE CAPTION "FINANCIAL REVIEW," AND NOTE 4 ON PAGES 97-98

OF THE COMPANY'S 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS WE

INCORPORATE HEREIN BY REFERENCE.)

REGULATION

CENTURION BANK IS A UTAH-CHARTERED INDUSTRIAL LOAN COMPANY REGULATED,

SUPERVISED AND REGULARLY EXAMINED BY THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION ("FDIC"). CENTURION

BANK IS AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. AEBFSB IS A FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK

REGULATED AND SUPERVISED BY THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION ("OTS"), A

DIVISION OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. AEBFSB IS AN

FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. AMONG THE ACTIVITIES OF CENTURION BANK AND

AEBFSB THAT ARE REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ARE THEIR RESPECTIVE ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE

PROGRAMS FOR ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS CONSISTENT WITH

APPLICABLE STANDARDS. YOU CAN FIND A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING INITIATIVES AFFECTING US UNDER "CORPORATE AND OTHER" BELOW.

22

CENTURION BANK IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS

PROMULGATED BY THE FDIC.  UNDER THESE REGULATIONS, A BANK IS DEEMED TO BE WELL-

CAPITALIZED IF IT MAINTAINS A TIER ONE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%,

A TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10% AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT

LEAST 5%. BASED ON CENTURION BANK'S TIER ONE RISK-BASED CAPITAL, TOTAL

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS, CENTURION BANK WAS CONSIDERED TO BE

WELL-CAPITALIZED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004.

AEBFSB IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS

PROMULGATED BY THE OTS. UNDER THESE REGULATIONS, A FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK IS

DEEMED TO BE WELL-CAPITALIZED IF IT MAINTAINS A TIER ONE RISK-BASED CAPITAL

RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%, A TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10%, AND A

TIER ONE CORE CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%. BASED ON AEBFSB'S TIER ONE

RISK-BASED CAPITAL, TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND TIER ONE CORE CAPITAL RATIOS,

AEBFSB WAS CONSIDERED TO BE WELL-CAPITALIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

IN 2003, AEBFSB AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES RECEIVED OTS APPROVAL TO,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, OFFER CERTAIN CREDIT, CHARGE AND CONSUMER LENDING PRODUCTS,

SMALL BUSINESS LOANS, MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED PRODUCTS AND TO OPERATE A

TRANSACTIONAL INTERNET SITE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CHANGES TO AEBFSB'S

BUSINESS PLAN, WHICH PROVIDES MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR US, BEGAN IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2004 WITH THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN CARD ACCOUNTS AND OTHER ASSETS FROM

CENTURION BANK TO AEBFSB. AEBFSB CONTINUES TO PROVIDE PERSONAL TRUST, CUSTODIAL,

AGENCY AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS OF AEFA. AEBFSB

IS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER. AEBFSB IS AUTHORIZED TO

TRANSACT BUSINESS IN ALL 50 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND UTILIZES

AEFA AS ITS PRIMARY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL FOR THESE SERVICES.

THE CHARGE CARD AND CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE

REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IN THE

UNITED STATES, THE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING.

-     THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (WHICH GENERALLY PROHIBITS

DISCRIMINATION IN THE GRANTING AND HANDLING OF CREDIT);

-     THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES

USE BY CREDITORS OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS AND CREDIT PRESCREENING

PRACTICES AND REQUIRES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES WHEN AN APPLICATION FOR

CREDIT IS REJECTED);

-     THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES

EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS UPON WHICH CREDIT IS GRANTED);

-     THE FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES

THE MANNER THAT BILLING INQUIRIES ARE HANDLED AND SPECIFIES CERTAIN

BILLING REQUIREMENTS);

-     THE FAIR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD DISCLOSURE ACT (WHICH MANDATES

CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ON CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD APPLICATIONS); AND

-     THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACT (WHICH REGULATES DISCLOSURES AND

SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS INCLUDING

THOSE AT ATMS).

CERTAIN FEDERAL PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE COLLECTION

AND USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SEE "CORPORATE AND

OTHER" BELOW). FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION

PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND MANY FOREIGN

COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION,

DISCLOSURE AND PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN THE

LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES). THE APPLICATION OF BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS

AFFECT US TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS RESULT IN AMOUNTS OWED BEING CLASSIFIED

AS DELINQUENT AND/OR CHARGED OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE. CARD ISSUERS AND CARD

NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION,

INCLUDING, IN THE UNITED STATES, THE USA PATRIOT ACT. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS

LEGISLATION AND ITS EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS SEE, "CORPORATE AND OTHER" BELOW.)

23

CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB AND OUR OTHER BANK ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A

VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN

SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATION THEREOF COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS

AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR CARD AND

LENDING BUSINESSES OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASING COMPLEX AND ROBUST. MORE

RECENTLY, REGULATORS (AS WELL AS VARIOUS CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS) HAVE BEGUN TO

FOCUS INCREASING ATTENTION ON THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF FEES CHARGED BY CARD

ISSUERS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LATE PAYMENTS, RETURNED CHECKS, PAYMENTS BY

TELEPHONE, COPIES OF STATEMENTS AND THE LIKE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW AND, AS

APPROPRIATE, REFINE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED

DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO

MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND

EXPECTATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL

(THE "FFIEC"), AN INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL

ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED NEW

GUIDANCE TO THE INDUSTRY ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE

PRACTICES (THE "GUIDANCE"). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE AREAS: (I) CREDIT LINE

MANAGEMENT, (II) OVER-LIMIT PRACTICES, (III) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE

AMORTIZATION PRACTICES, (IV) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES, AND (V) CERTAIN

INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES. THE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY

APPLICABLE TO ALL INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FEDERAL BANK

REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT COMPRISE THE FFIEC, ALTHOUGH IT IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT

OF THE IDENTIFICATION BY BANK REGULATORS IN THEIR EXAMINATIONS OF OTHER CREDIT

CARD LENDERS PRACTICES DEEMED BY THEM TO BE INAPPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY, BUT NOT

EXCLUSIVELY, WITH REGARD TO SUBPRIME LENDING PROGRAMS. AT PRESENT, WE DO NOT

HAVE ANY LENDING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE SUBPRIME MARKET. THE GUIDANCE HAS NOT

HAD ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE

THAT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE,

NOR DOES THE GUIDANCE MANDATE ANY CHANGES TO OUR PRACTICES.

GLOBAL CORPORATE SERVICES

TRS' GLOBAL CORPORATE SERVICES BUSINESS ("GCS") HELPS COMPANIES AROUND THE

WORLD BETTER MANAGE THE COSTS AND PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH A RANGE OF EXPENSES,

INCLUDING TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT AND EVERYDAY PURCHASES OF BUSINESS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. GCS OFFERS THREE PRIMARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

-     CORPORATE CARD, ISSUED TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGH A CORPORATE ACCOUNT

ESTABLISHED BY THEIR EMPLOYER AND DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING;

-     CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS, AN ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY A COMPANY

TO PAY FOR EVERYDAY BUSINESS EXPENSES SUCH AS OFFICE AND COMPUTER

SUPPLIES; AND

-     BUSINESS TRAVEL, WHICH HELPS BUSINESSES MANAGE THEIR TRAVEL EXPENSES

THROUGH A VARIETY OF TRAVEL-RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

CORPORATE CARD AND CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) CORPORATE CARD IS A CHARGE CARD THAT INDIVIDUALS

MAY OBTAIN THROUGH A CORPORATE ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY THEIR EMPLOYER FOR

BUSINESS PURPOSES. THROUGH THE CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM, COMPANIES CAN MANAGE

THEIR TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT AND PURCHASING

24

EXPENSES AND IMPROVE NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE WITH SUPPLIERS, AMONG OTHER BENEFITS.

WE USE OUR DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS TO OFFER CORPORATE CARD CLIENTS

SUPERIOR DATA ABOUT COMPANY SPENDING, AS WELL AS STREAMLINED DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

WE ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CORPORATE CARDS IN 36 COUNTRIES, WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE

THROUGH PROPRIETARY OPERATIONS AND PARTNER BANKS, AND INTERNATIONAL DOLLAR

CORPORATE CARDS IN 85 COUNTRIES. ADDITIONALLY, WITH THE LAUNCH OF OUR GLOBAL

DOLLAR CARD OFFERING, WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO OFFER OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS

IN OVER 200 COUNTRIES. IN 2004, WE LAUNCHED THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GOLD CORPORATE

CARD IN BRAZIL AND THE PLATINUM CARD IN CANADA.

CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS ("CPS") HELPS LARGE AND MIDDLE MARKET

COMPANIES MANAGE THEIR EVERYDAY SPENDING. CPS IS USED BY CORPORATIONS TO BUY

EVERYDAY GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES AND INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIES AND

EQUIPMENT, IN 24 MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS TYPE OF SPENDING BY CORPORATIONS

IS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS THAN TRADITIONAL TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING AND HELPS TO DIVERSIFY THE SPENDING MIX ON OUR CARDS.

GCS IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO GLOBAL,

MULTINATIONAL AND LARGE BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE. GCS ESTABLISHED THE GLOBAL

BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS GROUP WHICH SERVES A HIGHLY SELECT GROUP OF FORTUNE 100

COMPANIES THAT HAVE GLOBALIZED THEIR APPROACH TO TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT

EXPENSE MANAGEMENT AND HAVE STRUCTURED THEIR PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS IN A GLOBAL

MANNER TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND OPTIMIZE THEIR INVESTMENTS IN TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT, AS WELL AS EVERYDAY CORPORATE EXPENSES.

IN ADDITION, OUR GCS BUSINESS PROVIDES CORPORATE CARD AND TRAVEL EXPENSE

MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES (DEFINED IN THE UNITED STATES AS

FIRMS WITH ANNUAL REVENUES OF $10 MILLION TO $1 BILLION) IN DEVELOPED ECONOMIES

WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE,

SWEDEN, GERMANY, AUSTRALIA, SINGAPORE AND MEXICO. GCS IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUING

TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS WITH MIDSIZE COMPANIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE PRESENT US WITH

SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. BUSINESSES OF THIS SIZE OFTEN DO NOT HAVE

CORPORATE CARD PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, ONCE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM, MIDSIZED

COMPANIES, WHICH USUALLY DO NOT HAVE WELL-DEFINED PURCHASING PROGRAMS, WILL

TYPICALLY PUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR BUSINESS SPENDING (BOTH TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT AND NON-T&E;, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES) ON THE CARD BECAUSE THEY CAN

GAIN CONTROL, SAVINGS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. IN 2004, OUR GCS BUSINESS INVESTED

IN A WIDE RANGE OF MARKETING PROGRAMS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS, AND ADDED SALES

STAFF TO GENERATE MORE CARD AND TRAVEL BUSINESS WITH MIDSIZE FIRMS. GCS ALSO

OFFERS THE SAVINGS AT WORKSM PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS SIMILAR

PROGRAMS GLOBALLY, WHICH PROVIDES COMPANIES WITH DISCOUNTS ON EVERYDAY PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES, AND A RANGE OF BUSINESS SERVICES.

DURING 2004, WE ADDED OR RETAINED SEVERAL MAJOR CLIENTS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FOR THE CORPORATE CARD, INCLUDING JOHNSON & JOHNSON,

MOTOROLA, ICI, AVAYA, OWENS CORNING, SCHERING-PLOUGH, MEDTRONIC, AND SIEMENS.

IN 2004, WE ALSO ANNOUNCED A NEW BUSINESS ALLIANCE WITH CORPVAT UNDER

WHICH IT PROVIDES CERTAIN VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) RECOVERY SERVICES TO GCS

COMMERCIAL CARD CLIENTS. WE ALSO ANNOUNCED A NEW ALLIANCE WITH DEUTSCHE BANK TO

LAUNCH A JOINTLY-BRANDED CORPORATE CARD AND BUSINESS TRAVEL ACCOUNT PROGRAM TO

DEUTSCHE BANK'S CORPORATE CUSTOMERS. TRS ALSO

25

ENTERED INTO A COBRAND CARD ALLIANCE WITH PARADIGM TOTAL SALARY MANAGEMENT IN

AUSTRALIA FOR BOTH EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS TO BENEFIT FROM OUTSOURCED SALARY

PACKAGING ADMINISTRATION.

IN ADDITION, IN 2004, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH NAVIGANT

INTERNATIONAL, INC., A LEADING PROVIDER OF TRAVEL MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN THE

UNITED STATES, TO DISTRIBUTE OUR CORPORATE CARDS TO ITS CLIENTS IN THE UNITED

STATES.

WITH THE INCREASED FOCUS ON COST CONTAINMENT BY FIRMS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED

SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN THE CORPORATE MEETING CARD, WHICH

HELPS U.S.-BASED COMPANIES CONTROL COMPANY MEETING EXPENSES. THE CORPORATE

MEETING CARD PROVIDES CLIENTS WITH A TOOL TO CAPTURE SUCH SPENDING AND PROVIDES

COMPANY MEETING PLANNERS WITH A TOOL TO SIMPLIFY THE MEETINGS PAYMENT PROCESS

AND ACCESS TO DATA TO NEGOTIATE WITH SUPPLIERS. GCS ALSO OFFERS THE CORPORATE

DEFINED EXPENSE PROGRAM. THIS PRODUCT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO SET A MAXIMUM AMOUNT

TO BE CHARGED ON A CARD BEFORE EXPIRATION AND PERMITS THEM TO SEGREGATE SPENDING

DATA FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES ON PROJECTS. IT IS DESIGNED FOR COMPANIES THAT WANT

TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE RELOCATIONS OR

TRAINING.

GCS ALSO OFFERS AMERICAN EXPRESS @ WORK(R), A SECURE, WEB-BASED SUITE OF

ONLINE TOOLS THAT ENABLES CORPORATE CARD, CPS AND CORPORATE TRAVEL CUSTOMERS TO

PERFORM ACCOUNT REVIEW AND SERVICING AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT REPORTS ON A 24/7

BASIS THROUGH A SINGLE USER INTERFACE. THIS SUITE HELPS COMPANIES MANAGE

EXPENSES AND MANIPULATE SPEND DATA MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN OFFLINE ALTERNATIVES,

WHILE DECREASING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICING. THESE PRODUCTS ENABLE

COMPANIES TO REVIEW, COMBINE AND MANIPULATE CORPORATE CARD, CORPORATE TRAVEL AND

CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS DATA. ONE OF THE PRODUCTS ALSO ALLOWS COMPANIES

TO RECONCILE THE DATA WITH ITS INTERNAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

COMPETITION - GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS

COMPETITION IN THE COMMERCIAL CARD (CORPORATE CARD AND CPS) BUSINESS IS

INCREASINGLY INTENSE AT BOTH THE CARD NETWORK AND CARD ISSUER LEVELS. AT THE

NETWORK LEVEL, DINERS CLUB (WHICH, AS MENTIONED ABOVE, IS BEING FOLDED INTO THE

NETWORK OPERATED BY MASTERCARD IN THE UNITED STATES) REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT

GLOBAL COMPETITOR. IN ADDITION, BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE INCREASED EFFORTS

TO SUPPORT CARD ISSUERS SUCH AS U.S. BANK, JPMORGAN CHASE, GE CAPITAL FINANCIAL

INC. AND CITIBANK (IN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY), WHO ARE WILLING TO BUILD

AND SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING NECESSARY TO SATISFY CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, MASTERCARD HAS PROMOTED ENHANCED WEB-BASED

SUPPORT FOR ITS CORPORATE CARD ISSUING MEMBERS, AND VISA INTERNATIONAL SUPPORTED

THE CREATION OF A JOINT VENTURE BY A NUMBER OF ITS MEMBER BANKS FROM AROUND THE

WORLD TO COMPETE AGAINST US AND DINERS CLUB FOR THE BUSINESS OF MULTINATIONAL

COMPANIES. THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS ARE, IN

ADDITION TO THE FACTORS CITED ABOVE UNDER "CONSUMER CARD, SMALL BUSINESS AND

CONSUMER TRAVEL SERVICES -- COMPETITION".

-     THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE AND DELIVER DETAILED TRANSACTION DATA AND

EXPENSE MANAGEMENT REPORTS;

-     THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARDS;

-     PRICING;

26

-     THE RANGE AND INNOVATIVENESS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO SUIT

BUSINESS NEEDS

-     QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICES; AND

-     GLOBAL PRESENCE.

GLOBAL TRAVEL SERVICES

GCS GLOBAL TRAVEL SERVICES CONSISTS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS BUSINESS TRAVEL

(BT) AND CONSUMER TRAVEL INTERNATIONAL & FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES (CTI&FES;).

AMERICAN EXPRESS BUSINESS TRAVEL PROVIDES TRAVEL RESERVATION ADVICE AND

BOOKING TRANSACTION PROCESSING; TRAVEL EXPENSE MANAGEMENT POLICY CONSULTATION;

SUPPLIER NEGOTIATION AND CONSULTATION; MANAGEMENT INFORMATION REPORTING, DATA

ANALYSIS AND BENCHMARKING; AND GROUP AND INCENTIVE TRAVEL SERVICES.

BUSINESS TRAVEL SERVICES CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY IN 36 KEY MARKETS WORLDWIDE,

OF WHICH 31 ARE PROPRIETARY OPERATIONS AND FIVE ARE MANAGED THROUGH JOINT

VENTURES. IN ADDITION, BUSINESS TRAVEL ALSO SERVES CUSTOMERS IN NUMEROUS OTHER

MARKETS THROUGH FRANCHISE PARTNERSHIPS. WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR GLOBAL REACH

WITH OUR 2003 ACQUISITION OF ROSENBLUTH INTERNATIONAL, THE INTEGRATION OF WHICH

WAS COMPLETED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2004. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ROSENBLUTH

ACQUISITION HAS HELPED US EXPAND AN ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER COMPETITORS BY

ENHANCING OUR SERVICING CAPABILITIES, THE INTEGRATION OF SUPERIOR CUSTOMER

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ADDING HIGH PERFORMING TALENT AND CREATING ECONOMIES OF

SCALE.

IN 2004, WE WERE AWARDED THE CORPORATE TRAVEL BUSINESS OF, AMONG OTHER NEW

CLIENTS, GENERAL MOTORS, ELECTRONIC DATA SYSTEMS A.T. KEARNY, THE EUROPEAN

AERONAUTIC DEFENCE AND SPACE COMPANY, DHL AND THE U.K. MINISTRY OF DEFENCE.

BUSINESS TRAVEL CONTINUES TO MODIFY ITS ECONOMIC MODEL AND INVEST IN NEW

PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ADDRESS ONGOING TRAVEL INDUSTRY

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED OUR

RELIANCE ON COMMISSION REVENUES FROM SUPPLIERS (SUCH AS AIRLINES OR HOTELS), AND

NOW GENERATE REVENUES PRIMARILY FROM CUSTOMERS WHO PAY FOR THE SERVICES THAT WE

PROVIDE. WE ANNOUNCED A COMPREHENSIVE COST-SAVING TRAVEL MANAGEMENT OFFERING FOR

THE SMALL- AND MID-SIZED BUSINESS TRAVEL SEGMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, FEATURING

WEBFARE GUARANTEES, A NEW TRAVEL MANAGEMENT LOYALTY PROGRAM WITH DOUBLE

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS(R) POINTS FOR INDIVIDUAL TRAVELERS AND AUTOMATIC TICKET

REFUNDS. IN ADDITION, BUSINESS TRAVEL LAUNCHED THE PREFERRED EXTRAS HOTEL

PROGRAM AND PREFERRED SAVINGS PROGRAMS FOR OUR NORTH AMERICA CUSTOMER BASE.

BUSINESS TRAVEL ALSO OFFERS THE TRAVELBAHN(R) DISTRIBUTION SOLUTION, A

PROPRIETARY DISTRIBUTION SOLUTION ALTERNATIVE THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE BEST

AIRLINE INVENTORY AND FARES FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS BUSINESS TRAVEL CUSTOMERS WITH

A NUMBER OF CARRIERS, IN NORTH AMERICA AND IN SELECT INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

BUSINESS TRAVEL HAS MOVED MANY OF ITS BUSINESS PROCESSES AND CUSTOMER

SERVICING ONLINE, WHICH STREAMLINES PROCESSES, REDUCES COSTS, INCREASES

PRODUCTIVITY AND ENHANCES THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. TO THIS END, WE

LAUNCHED A REDESIGN OF OUR BUSINESS TRAVEL WEBSITE AT THE END OF 2004. BY THE

END OF 2004, IN THE UNITED STATES, 33% OF ALL OF GCS' CORPORATE TRAVEL

27

TRANSACTIONS WERE PROCESSED ONLINE, AND ONLINE PENETRATION RATES IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, CANADA, MEXICO AND AUSTRALIA ACHIEVED LEVELS WITHIN THE 6% TO 18%

RANGE.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CUSTOMERS AROUND THE GLOBE WITH TRAVEL RELATED PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. CTI&FES; ENCOMPASSES FOUR KEY AREAS OF BUSINESS: PREMIUM TRAVEL AND

LIFESTYLE SERVICES, TRAVEL SERVICE NETWORK, RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND

PLATINUM AND CENTURION CARD CUSTOMERS THROUGH 22 EXCLUSIVELY DEDICATED

INTERNATIONAL CALL CENTERS. OUR RETAIL LEISURE TRAVEL SERVICE NETWORK MANAGES

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS ON OUR BEHALF WORLDWIDE THROUGH MORE THAN 1,700 TRAVEL

OFFICE LOCATIONS IN MORE THAN 130 COUNTRIES. WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY EXPANDING OUR

RETAIL PRESENCE WORLDWIDE THROUGH FRANCHISING, NEARLY TRIPLING THE SIZE OF OUR

INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE NETWORK IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ALONE.

OUR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESS HAS A PRESENCE IN MANY OF OUR TRAVEL

OFFICES, AS WELL AS IN 26 OF THE WORLD'S MAJOR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS, INCLUDING

LONDON'S HEATHROW, THE AEROPORTS DE PARIS AND CHANGI AIRPORT IN SINGAPORE.

TODAY, AMERICAN EXPRESS IS THE THIRD LARGEST CURRENCY PROVIDER IN AIRPORTS. FOR

CORPORATE CLIENTS, OUR INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS ONLINE PAYMENT PRODUCT ALLOWS

COMPANIES AND BANKS TO MAKE CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS IN MORE THAN 110 FOREIGN

COMPETITION - TRAVEL SERVICES

BUSINESS TRAVEL FACES INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND

INTERNATIONALLY FROM NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT

COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS.

COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE,

CONVENIENCE, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION,

COMPETITION COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES, AS SOME COMPANIES HAVE

BECOME ACCREDITED AS IN-HOUSE CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS.

IN 2004, SEVERAL U.S.-BASED ONLINE TRAVEL AGENCIES EXPANDED THEIR

OFFERINGS AND MARKETING EFFORTS BEYOND THEIR TRADITIONAL TARGET CUSTOMER SET,

WITH INCREASING FOCUS ON CORPORATE TRAVEL. ORBITZ, EXPEDIA AND TRAVELOCITY HAVE

ALL BEGUN TO PURSUE MIDSIZED AND LARGER CORPORATE TRAVEL CUSTOMERS IN NORTH

AMERICA. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THE ONLINE AGENCIES' EFFORTS TO PENETRATE THE

MANAGED CORPORATE TRAVEL SECTOR HAS TO DATE OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES, IT IS

LIKELY THAT THEY WILL FOCUS MORE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO EXPAND INTO KEY, DEVELOPED

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS LIKE CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER EUROPEAN MARKETS

IN 2005.

SINCE 1995, TRAVEL AGENTS HAVE RECEIVED REDUCED LEVELS OF REVENUE FROM

AIRLINES, AND THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN

UNDER SEVERE FINANCIAL PRESSURE IN RECENT YEARS AND, AS A RESULT, HAS INCREASED

ITS EFFORTS TO REDUCE DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES. IN MARCH 2002, U.S. AIRLINES AND

SOME INTERNATIONAL CARRIERS STOPPED PAYING "BASE" COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL

28

AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA ON ALL DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL. SUBSEQUENTLY, AIRLINES IN MANY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS

FOLLOWED SUIT. IN ADDITION, LOW-COST CARRIERS HAVE BEGUN TO TARGET BUSINESS

TRAVELERS TO HELP FUEL THEIR GROWTH, PUTTING FURTHER STRAIN ON THE ABILITY OF

THE TRADITIONAL CARRIERS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. LOW-COST CARRIERS DO NOT RELY ON

TRAVEL AGENTS TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE TRADITIONAL

CARRIERS HAVE ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THEY BOOK DIRECTLY

THROUGH THEIR WEB SITES AND OTHER MEANS. THESE TRENDS HAVE REDUCED THE REVENUE

OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL AGENTS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE DISTRIBUTION REVENUE FROM

DIRECTLY BOOKED TRANSACTIONS.

OVERALL, THE ONGOING TRENDS OF AIRLINE DIRECT TRANSACTIONS, RISE OF

LOW-COST CARRIERS AND ONGOING REDUCTIONS IN AIRLINE COMMISSIONS CONTINUE TO PUT

PRESSURE ON REVENUE FOR TRAVEL AGENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE

BUSINESS MODEL OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, TRANSITIONING MANY OF OUR SERVICES

ONLINE AND REDUCING OTHER COSTS HAS HELPED US TO BALANCE THESE REVENUE

PRESSURES.

GLOBAL TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID SERVICES

WE HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF ISSUING AND SELLING TRAVELERS CHECKS FOR

WELL OVER 100 YEARS. TODAY, THAT BUSINESS IS OPERATED THROUGH OUR GLOBAL

TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID SERVICES GROUP ("TCPS"). TCPS ALSO OFFERS THE

TRAVELFUNDS DIRECT(R) SERVICE, WHICH PROVIDES DIRECT DELIVERY OF FOREIGN BANK

NOTES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES IN SELECTED MARKETS.

WE SELL THE AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELERS CHEQUE ("TRAVELERS CHEQUE" OR

"CHEQUE") AS A SAFE AND CONVENIENT ALTERNATIVE TO CASH. THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE HAS

NO EXPIRATION DATE AND IS PAYABLE BY THE ISSUER IN THE CURRENCY OF ISSUANCE WHEN

PRESENTED FOR THE PURCHASE OF GOODS AND SERVICES OR FOR REDEMPTION. TRAVELERS

CHEQUES ARE AVAILABLE IN NINE CURRENCIES, INCLUDING EUROS. WE ALSO ISSUE AND

SELL OTHER FORMS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS: AMERICAN EXPRESS GIFT CHEQUES ARE DESIGNED

FOR GIFT-GIVING PURPOSES, AND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS-SECURE FUNDS IS OFFERED IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES AS A SAFE WAY TO KEEP CASH AT HOME. AMERICAN EXPRESS GIFT

CHEQUES ARE AVAILABLE IN U.S. AND CANADIAN DOLLARS. AMERICAN EXPRESS

CHEQUES-SECURE FUNDS ARE ISSUED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND EUROS.

SINCE 2002, WE BEGAN TO EXPAND OUR PREPAID OFFERINGS BEYOND PAPER INTO

PLASTIC CARDS. IN 2004, TCPS CONTINUED TO OFFER TWO PREPAID GIFT CARDS IN THE

UNITED STATES: THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GIFT CARD, WHICH CAN BE USED IN THE UNITED

STATES AT RETAIL AS WELL AS RESTAURANT ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN

EXPRESS CARDS, AND THE BE MY GUEST(R) CARD, SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR RESTAURANT

DINING. ALSO IN 2004, TCPS EXPANDED SALES OF GIFT CARDS THROUGH SHOPPING MALLS

AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. AT THE END

OF 2004, TCPS BEGAN TO SELL A JAPANESE YEN-DENOMINATED AMERICAN EXPRESS GIFT

CARD IN JAPAN FOR USE IN THAT COUNTRY AT SELECTED RETAIL LOCATIONS THAT ACCEPT

OUR CARDS.

IN OCTOBER 2003, WE LAUNCHED THE AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELFUNDS CARD

("TFC") IN THE UNITED STATES, AND IN 2004, WE LAUNCHED TFC IN GERMANY UNDER THE

NAME "TRAVELERS CHEQUE CARD." THE TFC IS A RELOADABLE, PREPAID CARD THAT WE

MARKET AS A PLASTIC FORM OF OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUE. THE TFC IS AVAILABLE IN U.S.

DOLLARS, BRITISH POUNDS STERLING AND EUROS, IS SOLD IN THE

29

UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY AND CAN BE USED WORLDWIDE AT ALL

MERCHANTS AND ATMS THAT ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. THE TFC OFFERS THE

SAME CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SECURITY OF THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE, INCLUDING PASSPORT

AND CREDIT CARD REPLACEMENT ASSISTANCE.

TCPS IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATING ADDITIONAL PREPAID PRODUCTS TO OFFER TO OUR

CUSTOMERS.

AS NOTED, WE SELL AMERICAN EXPRESS PAPER AND PLASTIC PREPAID CARD PRODUCTS

THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS. WE SELL THESE PRODUCTS OURSELVES DIRECTLY TO

CONSUMERS VIA PHONE AND THE INTERNET, AND THESE SALES, WHILE REPRESENTING A

RELATIVELY SMALL PORTION OF ALL SALES, CONTINUED TO GROW IN 2004. PAPER

TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND GIFT CHEQUES ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH A BROAD NETWORK OF

SELLING OUTLETS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL OFFICES;

INDEPENDENT TRAVEL AGENTS; FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; AND MANY OTHER FINANCIAL,

TRAVEL AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THE SAME SELLERS ALSO SELL OUR PREPAID

CARDS. WE SOMETIMES COMPENSATE SELLING OUTLETS FOR THEIR SALES. WE ARE

INCREASINGLY SEEKING NEW TRAVEL AND COMMERCIAL SELLERS FOR OUR PREPAID CARDS. WE

ALSO CONTINUED TO EXPAND THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR PREPAID PRODUCTS WITH THE

ADDITION OF RETAIL, AIRLINE, CAR RENTAL, AND HOTEL SELLERS, AS WELL AS POSTAL

SERVICES IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.

ARRANGEMENTS WITH A DIVERSE GROUP OF SELLERS CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL TO

TCPS' EXPANSION OF ITS SALES DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. IN 2004, TCPS GAINED A NUMBER

OF NEW DISTRIBUTORS, INCLUDING DEPARTMENT STORES AND CONVENIENCE STORES.

DURING THE YEAR, OVERALL TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES (INCLUDING TFC SALES)

INCREASED 2% GLOBALLY, AND CONSUMER GIFT PRODUCT SALES (INCLUDING SALES OF PAPER

GIFT CHEQUES AND GIFT CARDS) INCREASED 49%. GIFT CHEQUE GROWTH, WHICH IS

CALCULATED FROM A MUCH LOWER BASE THAN TRAVELERS CHEQUES, IS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF NEW ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS. AN IMPROVED TRAVEL ENVIRONMENT

CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN BOTH TRAVELER'S CHEQUE AND TFC SALES.

WE INVEST THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID

CARDS ISSUED BY TRS PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY RATED DEBT SECURITIES CONSISTING

PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS.

REGULATION - TRAVELERS CHECKS AND PREPAID CARDS

AS AN ISSUER OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, TRS IS REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES

UNDER THE "MONEY TRANSMITTER" LAWS OF MOST STATES. THESE LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS

CHECK (AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, PREPAID CARD) ISSUERS TO OBTAIN LICENSES, TO MEET

CERTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN

HIGHLY RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. MANY

STATES AUDIT LICENSEES ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION, TRAVELERS CHECK ISSUERS ARE

REQUIRED BY THE LAWS OF MANY STATES TO COMPLY WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED

PROPERTY LAWS UNDER WHICH ISSUERS MUST PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY

TRAVELERS CHECK THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER 15 YEARS. A FEW STATES HAVE

AMENDED THEIR ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS TO APPLY TO PREPAID CARDS. SOME STATES

HAVE RECENTLY ENACTED LAWS PERTAINING TO THE ISSUANCE AND THE SALE OF GIFT

CERTIFICATES, WHICH MAY ALSO COVER THE GIFT CARDS WE ISSUE. SOME OF THESE LAWS

RESTRICT THE FEES THAT CONSUMERS CAN BE CHARGED AND THE EXPIRATION DATES OF THE

CARDS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA VERY

CLOSELY TO ENSURE WE COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE

30

REGULATION, WHICH VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE. FEDERAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

REGULATIONS REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELER CHECK

ISSUERS AS "MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES" AND COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

RECORDING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY ISSUERS AND SELLING OUTLETS. AT THIS

TIME, STORED VALUE ISSUERS AND REDEEMERS, WHILE CONSIDERED TO BE "MONEY SERVICE

BUSINESSES," ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE

VARYING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE SIMILAR TO

THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.

COMPETITION - TRAVELERS CHECKS AND PREPAID CARDS

TRAVELERS CHEQUES COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CASH, FOREIGN CURRENCY, CHECKS, OTHER BRANDS OF TRAVELERS

CHECKS, AND, INCREASINGLY, DEBIT AND ATM CARDS, AS WELL AS CREDIT AND CHARGE

CARDS (EVEN THOUGH TRAVELERS CHECKS AND PREPAID CARDS ARE NOT SUBSTITUTES FOR

CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS) AND, TO A LIMITED EXTENT, COMPETING PREPAID CARDS. THE

PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE TRAVELERS CHECK AND PREPAID CARD

INDUSTRY ARE.

-     THE NUMBER AND LOCATION OF MERCHANTS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE FORM OF

PAYMENT;

-     THE AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER OF OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT;

-     THE AMOUNT OF FEES CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER;

-     THE COMPENSATION PAID TO, AND FREQUENCY OF SETTLEMENT BY, SELLING

OUTLETS;

-     THE ACCESSIBILITY OF SALES AND REFUNDS FOR THE PRODUCTS;

-     THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; AND

-     THE ABILITY TO SERVICE THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTORILY, INCLUDING FOR

LOST OR STOLEN INSTRUMENTS.

OUR PREPAID CARDS (CARDS THAT CAN BE USED AT MANY DIFFERENT UNAFFILIATED

LOCATIONS) COMPETE WITH ALL OF THE SAME PAYMENT METHODS; HOWEVER, GIFT CARDS

COMPETE PRIMARILY WITH CASH AND CHECKS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS

OUR AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS OPERATING SEGMENT ("AEFA")

PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL CORPORATION ("AEFC") AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES DESCRIBED BELOW. AEFA HAS TWO PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

-     ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS PROVIDED BY AEFC AND CERTAIN OF

ITS SUBSIDIARIES; AND

-     INSURANCE PRODUCTS ISSUED BY IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("IDS LIFE")

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, THE "IDS LIFE COMPANIES"), AS

WELL AS IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY ("IDS PROPERTY

CASUALTY") AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE PRINCIPALLY OFFERED THROUGH

AEFA'S NETWORK OF OVER 12,300 FINANCIAL ADVISORS. THROUGH THIS BUSINESS MODEL,

AEFA BUILDS LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS BASED ON TRUSTED, KNOWLEDGEABLE

ADVICE.

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S PLANS TO PURSUE A SPIN-OFF OF AEFA, SEE

THE "INTRODUCTION" TO THIS REPORT ABOVE.

ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS

THROUGH ITS ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS BUSINESS, AEFA OFFERS A

BROAD ARRAY OF PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

TO HELP RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS MEET THEIR FINANCIAL GOALS. FOR RETAIL

CLIENTS, AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS ARE GUIDED BY THE FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS

AS DEFINED BY THE "PRINCIPLES FOR FINANCIAL PLANNING," ISSUED BY THE CERTIFIED

FINANCIAL PLANNER BOARD OF STANDARDS, INC. RETAIL CLIENTS, INCLUDING CLIENTS

WITH AN AEFA FINANCIAL PLAN, AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS SELECT AMONG INVESTMENT

PRODUCTS SUCH AS MUTUAL FUNDS, ANNUITIES, FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES, COLLECTIVE

FUNDS, REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND HEDGE

FUNDS; AND INVESTMENT SERVICES INCLUDING WRAP PROGRAMS, FINANCIAL PLANNING

SERVICES AND SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS. ADDITIONALLY, AEFA OFFERS A VARIETY OF

TAX-QUALIFIED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS,

EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS AND SECTION 529 COLLEGE SAVINGS PLANS;

PERSONAL TRUST SERVICES; AND RETAIL SECURITIES BROKERAGE THROUGH AMERICAN

EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS INC. ("AEFAI"), AN AEFC SUBSIDIARY.

APPROXIMATELY 76% OF AEFA'S REVENUES AND 70% OF AEFA'S PRE-TAX INCOME IN

2004 WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO ITS ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS BUSINESS. OUR

ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS BUSINESS PRIMARILY DERIVES REVENUES FROM THE

FEES WE RECEIVE FROM THE ASSET MANAGEMENT, FINANCIAL PLANNING AND DISTRIBUTION

SERVICES WE PROVIDE, ALONG WITH THE SPREAD INCOME EARNED ON ANNUITY ASSETS HELD

IN FIXED ACCOUNTS. AEFA CURRENTLY HAS OVER $410 BILLION IN ASSETS OWNED, MANAGED

AND ADMINISTERED.

ONE OF OUR PRIMARY GOALS IS TO INCREASE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF AEFA'S

PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR BOTH RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS.

IN FURTHERANCE OF THIS GOAL, THERE WERE SEVERAL KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS DURING 2004

THAT HELPED TO ENHANCE PRODUCT AND RETAIL SERVICE OFFERINGS,

33

IMPROVE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, STRENGTHEN OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES,

AND IMPROVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING.

-     CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF OUR AXP FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS, INCLUDING

THE MERGER OF SEVERAL EQUITY FUNDS AND THE LAUNCH OF A SERIES OF

STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS;

-     NATIONWIDE ROLLOUT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS GOLD FINANCIAL SERVICES,

DESIGNED FOR RETAIL CLIENTS WITH MORE THAN $100,000 IN ASSETS WITH

AEFA;

-     BROADENING OF OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT REACH INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH THE

SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF THREADNEEDLE ASSET MANAGEMENT HOLDINGS

LIMITED ("THREADNEEDLE"), AN AEFC SUBSIDIARY, AND THE CREATION OF A

GLOBAL FUND OF HEDGE FUNDS PLATFORM; AND

-     ENHANCING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP, TALENT AND

INFRASTRUCTURE.

WE ACHIEVED RECORD FINANCIAL PLANNING SALES AND FEE REVENUE IN 2004. OUR

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BENEFITED IN 2004 FROM AN INCREASE IN MANAGEMENT

FEE REVENUE RESULTING FROM HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. THIS

REFLECTED, IN LARGE PART, THE FULL-YEAR IMPACT OF THE THREADNEEDLE ACQUISITION

IN THE FALL OF 2003, ALONG WITH IMPROVED EQUITY MARKET PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL

NET ASSET INFLOWS FOR AEFA. OUTFLOWS FROM THE AXP RETAIL MUTUAL FUNDS (THE "AXP

FUNDS") AND NON-THREADNEEDLE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS PARTIALLY OFFSET THE GAINS IN

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. SINCE MOST FEES THAT AEFA RECEIVES FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT

AND RELATED SERVICES ARE BASED ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, MARKET APPRECIATION

RESULTS IN INCREASED REVENUES, AND INVERSELY, MARKET DEPRECIATION WILL ACT TO

DEPRESS REVENUES. REVENUES WILL ALSO FLUCTUATE DUE TO NET INFLOWS OR OUTFLOWS OF

ASSETS.

RETAIL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AXP FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS

AEFAI ACTS AS THE PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER (DISTRIBUTOR OF SHARES) FOR THE

AXP FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS. IN ADDITION, AEFC ACTS AS INVESTMENT MANAGER AND

AEFC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES PERFORM VARIOUS SERVICES FOR THE FUNDS, INCLUDING

ACCOUNTING, ADMINISTRATIVE, TRANSFER AGENCY AND CUSTODIAL SERVICES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE AXP FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS CONSISTED OF TWO GROUPS OF

FUNDS: (1) THE AXP FUNDS, A GROUP OF RETAIL MUTUAL FUNDS OFFERED TO THE PUBLIC

PRIMARILY THROUGH PROPRIETARY CHANNELS, AND (2) THE AXP VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS

("VP FUNDS"), WHICH ARE A SERIES OF VARIABLE PRODUCT PORTFOLIOS. THE VP FUNDS

ARE AVAILABLE ONLY AS UNDERLYING INVESTMENT OPTIONS IN OUR PROPRIETARY VARIABLE

ANNUITY AND VARIABLE LIFE PRODUCTS AND THROUGH CERTAIN NON-PROPRIETARY VARIABLE

ANNUITY PRODUCTS. BOTH THE AXP FUNDS AND THE VP FUNDS INCLUDE DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY, FIXED INCOME, CASH MANAGEMENT AND BALANCED FUNDS WITH A

VARIETY OF INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.

THE AXP FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS HAS INCREASED ITS USE OF SUBADVISORS OVER

THE LAST FEW YEARS TO DIVERSIFY AND ENHANCE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE. AS

OF JUNE 2004, THREADNEEDLE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED ("TINTL"), A THREADNEEDLE

COMPANY AND AN INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AEFC, BEGAN SUBADVISING THE

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY FUNDS WITHIN THE AXP FAMILY OF FUNDS. PREVIOUSLY, THESE

MUTUAL FUNDS WERE MANAGED BY THREADNEEDLE PERSONNEL THROUGH AN ARRANGEMENT WITH

AMERICAN EXPRESS ASSET MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL, INC. ("AEAMI"). KENWOOD CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT LLC ("KENWOOD"), ANOTHER AEFC AFFILIATE, ALSO

34

PROVIDES SUB-ADVISORY SERVICES TO ONE SMALL CAP AXP FUND AND ONE SMALL CAP VP

FUND. IN ADDITION TO TINTL AND KENWOOD, 20 UNAFFILIATED SUB-ADVISORS PROVIDE

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO THE AXP PARTNERS FUNDS, PART OF THE AXP FUNDS.

EIGHT NEW AXP FUNDS AND FOUR NEW VP FUNDS WERE LAUNCHED DURING 2004.

-     SIX AXP(R) PORTFOLIO BUILDER SERIES MUTUAL FUNDS, A COLLECTION OF

STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS OF MUTUAL FUNDS THAT ADDRESS

MULTIPLE INVESTMENT NEEDS;

-     THE AXP REAL ESTATE FUND, WHICH INVESTS PRIMARILY IN STOCKS OF REAL

ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITS);

-     THE AXP INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES FUND, WHICH INVESTS PRIMARILY

IN INFLATION-INDEXED BONDS; AND

-     FOUR VP FUNDS WITH A VARIETY OF FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY STRATEGIES.

IN 2004, SEVERAL AXP FUNDS AND VP FUNDS WERE ALSO MERGED INTO EXISTING AXP

FUNDS AND VP FUNDS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE BY

COMBINING SIMILAR FUNDS INTO LARGER FUNDS. IN ADDITION, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OF AXP MIDCAP INDEX FUND APPROVED THE LIQUIDATION OF THAT FUND.

THE AXP FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS NOW HAS 89 FUNDS WITH MORE THAN $83.5

BILLION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT COMPARED TO 83 FUNDS WITH MORE THAN $84.5

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE AXP FUNDS CONSISTED

OF 66 RETAIL MUTUAL FUNDS, INCLUDING THE EIGHT LAUNCHED IN 2004, WITH VARIED

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. THE AXP FUNDS HAD COMBINED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 OF

$65.3 BILLION COMPARED TO $68.8 BILLION AT THE END OF 2003. AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, THE AXP FUNDS WERE THE 31ST LARGEST RETAIL MUTUAL FUND FAMILY IN THE

UNITED STATES AND, EXCLUDING MONEY MARKET FUNDS, WERE THE 23RD LARGEST ACCORDING

TO STRATEGIC INSIGHT. THE VP FUNDS CONSIST OF 23 VARIABLE PRODUCT PORTFOLIOS

(FOUR OF WHICH COMMENCED OPERATIONS IN 2004) THAT OFFER A VARIETY OF INVESTMENT

STRATEGIES INCLUDING CASH MANAGEMENT, FIXED INCOME AND DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY. THE VP FUNDS HAD COMBINED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, OF

$18.2 BILLION COMPARED TO $15.7 BILLION AT THE END OF 2003.

AS STATED ABOVE, WE HAVE TAKEN SOME MAJOR STEPS TO IMPROVE INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE OF THE AXP FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS BY ENHANCING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

LEADERSHIP, TALENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE. FOCUSED ON OUTPERFORMING SPECIFIC

BENCHMARKS, WE BEGAN IMPROVING OUR FIXED INCOME PERFORMANCE IN 2003, FOLLOWED UP

WITH A STRONG 2004. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED BLACKROCK SOLUTIONS(R) AS OUR PRIMARY

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR FIXED INCOME

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. IN EQUITIES, WE SAW STRONG RESULTS IN MANY FUNDS,

PARTICULARLY THOSE IN WHICH NEW FUND MANAGERS WERE HIRED OVER THE PAST FEW

YEARS. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE EFFORTS, A FEW LARGE AXP EQUITY FUNDS

UNDERPERFORMED THEIR BENCHMARKS IN 2004. ALSO, MANY OF THE AXP FUNDS HAVE

CERTAIN ASSET LEVELS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO BENEFIT FROM THE ECONOMIES OF

SCALE EXPERIENCED BY OUR COMPETITORS, WHICH RESULTS IN EXPENSE RATIOS THAT MAY

BE HIGHER THAN COMPETING FUNDS. OVERALL, THE AXP FUNDS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT

ASSET OUTFLOWS IN 2004.

AEFC EARNS MANAGEMENT FEES FOR MANAGING THE ASSETS OF THE AXP FAMILY OF

MUTUAL FUNDS BASED ON THE UNDERLYING ASSET VALUES. AEFC AND CERTAIN OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES ALSO EARN FEES BY

35

PROVIDING OTHER SERVICES TO THE AXP FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS. AXP FUNDS THAT ARE

EQUITY OR BALANCED FUNDS HAVE A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE ADJUSTMENT ("PIA"). THIS

PIA ADJUSTS THE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED, BOTH UPWARD AND DOWNWARD,

BASED ON THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED AGAINST A DESIGNATED EXTERNAL INDEX

OF PEERS, WHICH HAS A CORRESPONDING IMPACT ON MANAGEMENT FEE REVENUE. AGGREGATE

MANAGEMENT FEES FROM THE AXP FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS WERE ADJUSTED DOWNWARD BY

$21.1 MILLION FOR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE ADJUSTMENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CALENDAR

YEAR 2004.

AEFAI EARNS COMMISSIONS FOR DISTRIBUTING THE AXP FUNDS THROUGH SALES

CHARGES (FRONT-END OR BACK-END LOADS) ON CERTAIN CLASSES OF SHARES AND

DISTRIBUTION (12B-1) FEES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF FUND ASSETS, AND RECEIVES

INTERCOMPANY ALLOCATION PAYMENTS FROM AEFC.

AEFC AFFILIATES ALSO SERVE AS SUB-ADVISORS TO CERTAIN OFFSHORE MUTUAL

FUNDS SPONSORED BY AEB THAT ARE ORGANIZED AS LUXEMBOURG FUNDS AND ADVISED BY

AMERICAN EXPRESS ASSET MANAGEMENT (CAYMAN) LTD.

NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS

WE HAVE INCREASED OUR SALE OF NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY

MUTUAL FUNDS, TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF CLIENTS FOR A BROADER CHOICE OF INVESTMENT

PRODUCTS. IN 2004, OUR RETAIL SALES OF NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS ACCOUNTED

FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR TOTAL RETAIL MUTUAL FUND SALES. WE OFFER MORE

THAN 2,000 NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS FROM MORE THAN 200 MUTUAL FUND FAMILIES.

IN 2003, WE CREATED THE SELECT GROUP PROGRAM FOR MUTUAL FUNDS. AS OF THE END OF

2004, THIS PROGRAM CONSISTED OF 12 FUND FAMILIES, INCLUDING THE AXP FUNDS,

OFFERING APPROXIMATELY 790 MUTUAL FUNDS. WE CHOSE NON-PROPRIETARY FUND FAMILIES

TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SELECT GROUP PROGRAM BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA INCLUDING

BRAND RECOGNITION, PRODUCT BREADTH, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, ADVISOR TRAINING AND

WHOLESALING SUPPORT, AND REVENUE SHARING PAYMENTS. IN EXCHANGE FOR CERTAIN

BENEFITS, SUCH AS BROADER ACCESS TO OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS, NON-PROPRIETARY FUND

FAMILIES IN THE SELECT GROUP PROGRAM ARE REQUIRED TO PAY US FOR PARTICIPATION IN

THE PROGRAM BY SHARING A PORTION OF THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SALES OF

THOSE FUNDS AND FROM THE ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF FUND ASSETS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR

CLIENTS' OWNERSHIP IN SHARES OF SELECT GROUP FUNDS. WE ALSO RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM

CERTAIN OTHER NON-PROPRIETARY FUND FAMILIES WHOSE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH

OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND ONLINE BROKERAGE. AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER

"REGULATION - ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS," AEFA AND OTHER INDUSTRY

PARTICIPANTS ARE THE SUBJECT OF VARIOUS REGULATORY INQUIRIES WITH RESPECT TO

SEVERAL MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY PRACTICES, INCLUDING REVENUE SHARING. WE EXPECT TO

ADOPT REVISED REVENUE SHARING PRACTICES IN 2005, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO RESULT IN A

REDUCTION OF REVENUE SHARING RATES AND COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN REVENUES.

WE ALSO RECEIVE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FEES FROM MOST MUTUAL FUNDS SOLD THROUGH

OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.

WE MAKE AVAILABLE BOTH PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS ON A

"STAND-ALONE" BASIS (I.E., OUTSIDE OF WRAP ACCOUNTS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED UNDER

"WRAP ACCOUNTS" BELOW). SALES OF NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS ON A STAND-ALONE

BASIS GENERALLY ARE LESS PROFITABLE TO US THAN SALES OF PROPRIETARY MUTUAL

FUNDS.

36

WRAP ACCOUNTS

IN ADDITION TO PURCHASES OF PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS

ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, CLIENTS MAY PURCHASE MUTUAL FUNDS, AMONG OTHER

SECURITIES, IN CONNECTION WITH "WRAP" AND OTHER FEE-BASED PROGRAMS OR SERVICES

AND PAY FEES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR ASSETS. INVESTORS IN WRAP ACCOUNTS

GENERALLY PAY AN ASSET-BASED FEE ON INVESTMENTS MADE WITHIN THE WRAP ACCOUNT. IN

2004, A SMALL PORTION OF OUR PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUND SALES AND APPROXIMATELY

ONE-HALF OF OUR NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUND SALES WERE MADE IN THESE WRAP

PROGRAMS. THE SALE OF MUTUAL FUNDS MADE THROUGH WRAP PROGRAMS GENERALLY IS MORE

PROFITABLE THAN THE SALE OF MUTUAL FUNDS ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

ONE SUCH WRAP PROGRAM WE SPONSOR IS AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) STRATEGIC

PORTFOLIO SERVICE ADVANTAGE ("SPS"), A NON-DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT ADVISORY

WRAP PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR INVESTMENTS IN PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL

FUNDS AND OTHER INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES. THE SPS WRAP PROGRAM HAD TOTAL CLIENT

ASSETS VALUED AT $35 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO $24 BILLION AT THE

END OF 2003.

WE ALSO PROVIDE AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) PREMIER PORTFOLIO SERVICES

("PREMIER"), A SERVICE THAT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE CONSOLIDATED REPORTING

AND INFORMATION ON ONE OR MORE FEE-BASED ACCOUNTS. THE FEE-BASED ACCOUNTS

AVAILABLE IN PREMIER CURRENTLY INCLUDE NON-DISCRETIONARY BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, FOR

WHICH CLIENTS PAY AN ASSET-BASED FEE IN LIEU OF INDIVIDUAL SALES CHARGES AND/OR

COMMISSIONS ON MUTUAL FUND AND INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. ALSO

AVAILABLE IN PREMIER IS THE SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNT PROGRAM, AN INVESTMENT

ADVISORY WRAP PROGRAM IN WHICH CLIENTS SELECT ONE OR MORE PROFESSIONAL

INDEPENDENT AND/OR AFFILIATED INVESTMENT MANAGERS TO PROVIDE DISCRETIONARY ASSET

MANAGEMENT SERVICES. CLIENTS IN AMERICAN EXPRESS(R) WEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE

("WMS"), ANOTHER PROFESSIONALLY MANAGED DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT ADVISORY WRAP

SERVICE SPONSORED BY AEFAI THAT IS BEING DISCONTINUED, HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE

OPTION TO TRANSITION TO THE SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNT PROGRAM WITHIN PREMIER.

THE PREMIER AND WMS WRAP PROGRAMS HAD TOTAL COMBINED CLIENT ASSETS VALUED AT

$1.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO $1.6 BILLION AT THE END OF 2003.

AN OPERATING DIVISION OF AMERICAN EXPRESS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP INC.

("AEAMG"), AN AEFC SUBSIDIARY, ALSO SERVES AS THE DISCRETIONARY MANAGER FOR

CLIENTS PARTICIPATING IN DISCRETIONARY WRAP PROGRAMS SPONSORED BY AEAMI AND AEB.

ANNUITIES

AEFA OFFERS BOTH VARIABLE AND FIXED ANNUITY PRODUCTS ISSUED PRIMARILY BY

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES. OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS DO NOT OFFER ANNUITY PRODUCTS OF

OUR COMPETITORS, EXCEPT FOR ANNUITIES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR USE IN THE SMALL

EMPLOYER 401(K) MARKET THAT ARE ISSUED BY TWO INSURANCE COMPANIES NOT AFFILIATED

WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS. AEFAI SERVES AS THE DISTRIBUTOR OF VARIABLE ANNUITIES

ISSUED BY IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK.

IDS LIFE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST ISSUERS OF ANNUITIES IN THE UNITED STATES.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES, ON A CONSOLIDATED

BASIS, RANKED ELEVENTH IN NEW SALES OF VARIABLE ANNUITIES ACCORDING TO VARDS(R),

AN INDEPENDENT ANNUITY RATING SERVICE. AEFA CONTINUES TO EXPAND DISTRIBUTION BY

DELIVERING ANNUITY PRODUCTS ISSUED BY

37

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES THROUGH NON-AFFILIATED REPRESENTATIVES AND AGENTS OF

THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE SPECIFICALLY OFFERED THROUGH

AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE") AND

AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY ("AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE"), BOTH IDS

LIFE SUBSIDIARIES.

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES POSTED FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITY CASH SALES IN

2004 OF $6.1 BILLION, A SLIGHT DECREASE FROM 2003, REFLECTING INCREASED VARIABLE

ANNUITY SALES, OFFSET BY DECREASED FIXED ANNUITY SALES. THE RELATIVE PROPORTION

BETWEEN FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITY SALES IS GENERALLY DRIVEN BY THE RELATIVE

PERFORMANCE OF THE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME MARKETS. IN TIMES OF LACKLUSTER

PERFORMANCE IN EQUITY MARKETS, FIXED SALES ARE GENERALLY STRONGER. IN TIMES OF

SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE IN EQUITY MARKETS, VARIABLE SALES ARE GENERALLY STRONGER.

THE RELATIVE PROPORTION BETWEEN FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITY SALES IS ALSO

INFLUENCED BY PRODUCT DESIGN AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' EARNINGS FROM FIXED ANNUITIES ARE BASED UPON THE

SPREAD BETWEEN THE INTEREST CREDITING RATE ON OUR FIXED ANNUITY CONTRACTS AND

THE RETURNS EARNED ON INVESTMENT OF PREMIUMS AND DEPOSITS IN THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' GENERAL ACCOUNTS. VARIABLE ANNUITIES PROVIDE US WITH FEE-BASED

REVENUE IN THE FORM OF MORTALITY AND EXPENSE CHARGES, AND FEES CHARGED FOR

OPTIONAL FEATURES ELECTED BY THE CONTRACT OWNER AND OTHER CONTRACT CHARGES. WE

ALSO RECEIVE FEES CHARGED ON ASSETS ALLOCATED TO OUR SEPARATE ACCOUNTS TO COVER

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AS WELL AS A PORTION OF THE MANAGEMENT FEES FROM THE

UNDERLYING INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS IN WHICH ASSETS ARE INVESTED, AS DISCUSSED BELOW

UNDER "VARIABLE ANNUITIES." INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE IS CRITICAL TO THE

PROFITABILITY OF OUR ANNUITY BUSINESS.

VARIABLE AND FIXED ANNUITIES ISSUED BY IDS LIFE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MAY

BE DEFERRED, WHERE ASSETS ACCUMULATE UNTIL THE CONTRACT IS SURRENDERED, THE

CONTRACT OWNER DIES, OR THE CONTRACT OWNER BEGINS RECEIVING BENEFITS UNDER AN

ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTION; OR IMMEDIATE, WHERE PAYMENTS BEGIN WITHIN ONE YEAR OF

ISSUE AND CONTINUE FOR LIFE OR FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME.

A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN INSURANCE-RELATED ASPECTS OF THE ANNUITY PRODUCTS

WE PROVIDE, INCLUDING A DISCUSSION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS AND OUR

INSURANCE COMPANY RATINGS, IS INCLUDED UNDER THE "INSURANCE" SECTION BELOW.

VARIABLE ANNUITIES. A VARIABLE ANNUITY PROVIDES A CONTRACT OWNER WITH

INVESTMENT RETURNS LINKED TO UNDERLYING INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS OF THE CONTRACT

OWNER'S CHOICE. THESE INVESTMENT OPTIONS MAY INCLUDE THE VP FUNDS DISCUSSED

ABOVE AS WELL AS NON-PROPRIETARY FUNDS. VARIABLE ANNUITY PRODUCTS ALSO OFFER A

FIXED ACCOUNT INVESTMENT OPTION WITH GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATES

RANGING FROM 0% TO 4% AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

CONTRACT OWNERS CAN ALSO CHOOSE AMONG VARIOUS CONTRACT PROVISIONS,

INCLUDING GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFIT ("GMDB") AND GUARANTEED MINIMUM

INCOME BENEFIT ("GMIB") RIDERS. THE GMDB RIDER PROTECTS CONTRACT BENEFICIARIES

FROM A DROP IN DEATH BENEFITS DUE TO PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING SUBACCOUNTS.

THE GMIB RIDER GUARANTEES, AFTER A CERTAIN WAITING PERIOD FROM CONTRACT

ISSUANCE, MINIMUM ANNUITY PAYMENTS BASED ON A SPECIFIED RATE OF CONTRACT

ACCUMULATION VALUE GROWTH AND PREDETERMINED ANNUITY PURCHASE RATES. THE GENERAL

ACCOUNT ASSETS OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES SUPPORT THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE GMDB

AND GMIB RIDERS (SEE "INSTITUTIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES - IDS LIFE COMPANIES

GENERAL ACCOUNTS" SECTION

38

BELOW). AS A RESULT, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES BEAR THE RISK THAT PROTRACTED

UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD RESULT IN GMDBS AND GMIBS BEING

HIGHER THAN WHAT CURRENT ACCOUNT VALUES WOULD SUPPORT. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES'

EXPOSURE TO RISK FROM GMDBS AND GMIBS GENERALLY WILL INCREASE WHEN EQUITY

MARKETS DECLINE.

FIXED ANNUITIES. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' FIXED ANNUITY PRODUCTS PROVIDE

CASH VALUE THAT INCREASES BY A FIXED INTEREST RATE. THE RATE IS PERIODICALLY

RESET AT THE DISCRETION OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN POLICY

TERMS RELATIVE TO MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATES. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES RESET

INTEREST RATES BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SCENARIO

MODELS AND RISK/RETURN MEASURES. THE ANNUITY CONTRACTS ISSUED BY THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES PROVIDE GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATES RANGING FROM 1.5%

TO 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN 2003 AND IN RESPONSE TO A DECLINING INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT, SEVERAL STATES ADOPTED AN INTERIM REGULATION ALLOWING FOR A

GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATE OF 1.5% AND/OR A MODEL REGULATION

PROVIDING FOR A GUARANTEED RATE THAT WAS INDEXED. A NUMBER OF STATES NOW FOLLOW

THE MODEL REGULATION. IN RESPONSE, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES FILED A NUMBER OF

CONTRACT CHANGES IN 2003 AND 2004 TO BEGIN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LOWER MINIMUM

GUARANTEES. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT CONTRACT CHANGES

AS STATES ADOPT THE NEW MODEL REGULATION OR AS THE INTERIM REGULATION SUNSETS.

LIABILITIES AND RESERVES. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES MUST MAINTAIN ADEQUATE

FINANCIAL RESERVES TO COVER THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GMDB, GMIB AND CERTAIN

OTHER RIDERS THEY OFFER. GENERALLY, RESERVES REPRESENT ESTIMATED ASSETS THAT THE

IDS LIFE COMPANIES NEED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR FUTURE BENEFITS AND EXPENSES.

ACTUAL EXPERIENCE MAY DIFFER FROM THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' ESTIMATES. YOU CAN

FIND A DISCUSSION OF LIABILITIES AND RESERVES RELATED TO OUR ANNUITY PRODUCTS IN

NOTE 1 TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER "INSURANCE AND

ANNUITY RESERVES" ON PAGES 89-90 OF OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS,

WHICH PORTION OF SUCH REPORT IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES

AMERICAN EXPRESS CERTIFICATE COMPANY ("AECC"), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY

OF AEFC, ISSUES FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS. AECC IS

REGISTERED AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940.

AECC CURRENTLY ISSUES NINE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CERTIFICATE PRODUCTS. OWNERS OF

AECC CERTIFICATES INVEST FUNDS WITH AECC AND ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE, AT

MATURITY OR THE END OF A STATED TERM, A DETERMINABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY EQUAL TO

THEIR AGGREGATE INVESTMENTS IN THE CERTIFICATE PLUS INTEREST AT RATES DECLARED

FROM TIME TO TIME BY AECC, LESS ANY WITHDRAWALS AND EARLY WITHDRAWAL PENALTIES.

FOR THREE TYPES OF CERTIFICATE PRODUCTS, THE RATE OF INTEREST IS CALCULATED IN

WHOLE OR IN PART BASED ON ANY UPWARD MOVEMENT IN A BROAD-BASED STOCK MARKET

INDEX UP TO A VARIABLE MAXIMUM RETURN.

WE BELIEVE THAT AECC IS THE LARGEST ISSUER OF FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES IN

THE UNITED STATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, IT HAD APPROXIMATELY $6 BILLION IN

ASSETS. AECC'S EARNINGS ARE BASED UPON THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE INTEREST RATES

CREDITED TO CERTIFICATE HOLDERS AND THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE CERTIFICATE

ASSETS INVESTED BY AECC. A PORTION OF THESE EARNINGS ARE USED TO COMPENSATE THE

VARIOUS AFFILIATED AND UNAFFILIATED ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE MANAGEMENT,

ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER SERVICES TO AECC. AECC'S CERTIFICATES COMPETE WITH MANY

OTHER

39

INVESTMENTS OFFERED BY BANKS, SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS, CREDIT UNIONS,

MUTUAL FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SIMILAR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH MAY

BE VIEWED BY POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AS OFFERING A COMPARABLE OR SUPERIOR

COMBINATION OF SAFETY AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT. IN TIMES OF WEAK PERFORMANCE IN

THE EQUITY MARKETS, CERTIFICATE SALES ARE GENERALLY STRONGER. AEFAI SERVES AS

THE DISTRIBUTOR OF FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES ISSUED BY AECC.

AEFC ALSO OPERATES A JOINT VENTURE CALLED AMERICAN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL

DEPOSIT COMPANY ("AEIDC") IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS WITH ITS AFFILIATE, AEB. AEIDC

OFFERS DEPOSITS SIMILAR TO FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES IN U.S. DOLLAR, EURO, POUND

STERLING AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR DENOMINATIONS.

FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES

AEFA'S FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES ASSIST CLIENTS IN MEETING IMPORTANT

FINANCIAL GOALS, LIKE RETIREMENT, EDUCATION AND HOME BUYING. THE FINANCIAL

PLANNING PROCESS GENERALLY BEGINS WITH GATHERING CLIENT DATA, INCLUDING GOALS.

THE FINANCIAL ADVISORS PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH A WRITTEN ANALYSIS BASED ON THE

CLIENTS' PERSONAL GOALS AND NEEDS. BASED ON THE WRITTEN ADVICE, OUR FINANCIAL

ADVISORS WORK WITH THEIR CLIENTS TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE PROPRIETARY AND

NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO HELP THEM MEET THEIR NEEDS AND ACHIEVE

THEIR FINANCIAL GOALS.

IN PROVIDING OUR FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES, WE ARE GUIDED BY THE

"PRINCIPLES FOR FINANCIAL PLANNING," ISSUED BY THE CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER

BOARD OF STANDARDS, INC. CLIENTS PAY FEES TO US FOR FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES

BASED UPON THE SERVICES THEY SELECT AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THEIR FINANCIAL

SITUATION. WE CHARGE CLIENTS A FLAT FEE, AN HOURLY RATE OR A COMBINATION OF THE

TWO. THE FEE IS NOT BASED ON, OR RELATED TO, THE PERFORMANCE OF A CLIENT'S FUNDS

OR ASSETS. DEPENDING ON WHAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR SITUATION, CLIENTS MAY

SELECT A LIMITED ENGAGEMENT PERIOD OR MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE ONGOING FINANCIAL

PLANNING SERVICES FROM THEIR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. FINANCIAL PLANNING CLIENTS ARE

UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM AEFA IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE

RECOMMENDATIONS IN THEIR FINANCIAL PLAN, BUT IF THEY CHOOSE TO IMPLEMENT WITH

US, AEFA AND OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS GENERALLY RECEIVE A SALES COMMISSION FOR THE

INVESTMENT, INSURANCE AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THAT CLIENTS PURCHASE, WHICH

IS SEPARATE FROM AND IN ADDITION TO THE FEE THEY RECEIVE FOR THE PROVISION OF

FINANCIAL PLANNING ADVICE.

WE ACHIEVED RECORD FINANCIAL PLANNING SALES AND FEE REVENUE IN 2004. PLAN

SALES INCREASED BY 14% AND FEES FROM FINANCIAL PLANNING RELATIONSHIPS INCREASED

BY 15% OVER 2003. DURING 2004, JUST OVER 52% OF OUR NEW RETAIL CLIENTS HAD A

FINANCIAL PLAN DEVELOPED FOR THEM BY ONE OF OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS, UP SLIGHTLY

FROM 51% IN 2003. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FOUND THAT FINANCIAL PLANNING CLIENTS

TEND TO HAVE DEEPER AND LONGER-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH US. PRODUCT SALES

GENERATED THROUGH FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES WERE 75% OF TOTAL ADVISOR SALES IN

2003 AND 2004. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE HAD OVER ONE MILLION CURRENT CLIENTS

WITH A FINANCIAL PLAN, AN INCREASE OF 3% OVER 2003.

WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS AND TRAINING FOR OUR

FINANCIAL ADVISORS TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THEIR ABILITY TO OFFER SOUND ADVICE AND

ONGOING FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES. IN LATE 2002, WE CONTRACTED WITH

MORNINGSTAR ASSOCIATES, LLC TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE TOOLS THAT SERVE BOTH

RETAIL AND WORKPLACE MARKETS. AS A COMPLEMENT TO OUR OWN PROPRIETARY

40

SUITE OF FINANCIAL PLANNING TOOLS, WE ROLLED-OUT MORNINGSTAR(R) ADVISOR

WORKSTATION(SM) (WHICH INCLUDES THE PROPRIETARY AMERICAN EXPRESS LIFETIME

OPTIMIZER(SM)) TO ALL ADVISORS IN 2004. THIS TOOL FURTHER ENABLES OUR ADVISORS

TO MEET THE ONGOING FINANCIAL AND INVESTMENT PLANNING NEEDS OF CLIENTS,

ESPECIALLY THE NEEDS OF MORE AFFLUENT CLIENTS.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FOCUS ON FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE, COUPLED WITH

AN ABILITY TO PROVIDE BROAD-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON A RELATIONSHIP BASIS,

IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS MORE RELEVANT

TODAY THAN IN THE PAST AS A RESULT OF THE SIGNIFICANT MARKET VOLATILITY

EXPERIENCED DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE INCREASED NUMBER AND TYPES OF

PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS, INCREASED CONSUMER FOCUS ON PREPARING FOR

RETIREMENT, AND THE INCREASED COMPLEXITY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.

BROKERAGE SERVICES AND OTHER PRODUCTS

OUR ONLINE BROKERAGE BUSINESS, AMERICAN EXPRESS BROKERAGE, ALLOWS CLIENTS

TO PURCHASE AND SELL SECURITIES ONLINE, OBTAIN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND

INFORMATION ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF SECURITIES, USE SELF-DIRECTED ASSET

ALSO ALLOWS CLIENTS TO ADD THIRD PARTY ACCOUNT INFORMATION, PROVIDING A

CONSOLIDATED VIEW OF THEIR FINANCIAL SERVICES ACCOUNT RELATIONSHIPS.

OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS MAY ALSO SELL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS

DISTRIBUTORS OF PRIVATELY-ISSUED REITS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, WE

SERVICE, BUT DO NOT SELL, MANAGED FUTURES LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS IN WHICH AN AEFC

SUBSIDIARY IS A CO-GENERAL PARTNER. THESE PRODUCTS SUBJECT AEFAI AND ITS

CO-GENERAL PARTNER SUBSIDIARY TO REGULATION BY THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING

SUBSIDIARY OF AEFC, PROVIDES SECURITIES EXECUTION AND CLEARANCE SERVICES FOR OUR

RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, OUR AEIS SUBSIDIARY

MORTGAGE-RELATED PRODUCTS AND OPERATE A TRANSACTIONAL INTERNET SITE. YOU CAN

FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING AEBFSB UNDER "CONSUMER CARD, SMALL

RETAIL DISTRIBUTION

FINANCIAL ADVISORS

AEFA'S INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO RETAIL CLIENTS

PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR NETWORK OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS. OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS WORK

WITH RETAIL CLIENTS TO DEVELOP STRONG RELATIONSHIPS AND LONG-TERM FINANCIAL

STRATEGIES. AS REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES OF AEFAI, OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS ALSO

PROVIDE CLIENTS ACCESS TO THE BROAD ARRAY OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

DISCUSSED ABOVE, AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LIFE

INSURANCE, DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE, LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE, AND PROPERTY

AND CASUALTY INSURANCE DESCRIBED UNDER "INSURANCE" BELOW. AEFA ALSO OPERATES A

NON-AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED INDEPENDENT PLATFORM, SECURITIES AMERICA, INC.

("SAI"), A BROKER-DEALER OWNED BY AEFC. SAI DISTRIBUTES MUTUAL FUNDS, ANNUITIES

AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS, IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING SECURITIES BROKERAGE SERVICES

TO ITS CLIENTS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE MAINTAINED A NATIONWIDE SALES FORCE OF OVER

12,300 FINANCIAL ADVISORS, INCLUDING OVER 10,700 AFFILIATED WITH AEFAI AND OVER

1,600 AFFILIATED WITH SAI, WHICH REPRESENTED A 1.8% INCREASE OVER 2003. OUR

FINANCIAL ADVISORS SERVED MORE THAN 2.7 MILLION CLIENTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

STATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, COMPARED TO MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION CLIENTS AT THE

END OF 2003.

AEFAI'S ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE CONSISTS OF TWO OPTIONS FOR BRANDED

ADVISORS TO AFFILIATE WITH THE ORGANIZATION. EACH AFFILIATION OFFERS SEPARATE

LEVELS OF SUPPORT AND COMPENSATION.

-     EMPLOYEE ADVISORS. THE EMPLOYEE FINANCIAL ADVISOR AFFILIATION

PROVIDES COMPENSATION TO THE ADVISOR, AN AMERICAN EXPRESS EMPLOYEE,

AS A DRAW AGAINST COMMISSIONS. OUR EMPLOYEE ADVISORS RECEIVE A

HIGHER LEVEL OF SUPPORT IN EXCHANGE FOR A LOWER PAYOUT RATE.

-     AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED FRANCHISEE ADVISORS AND ASSOCIATE ADVISORS.

IN OUR BRANDED FRANCHISEE ADVISOR AFFILIATION, ADVISORS ARE

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR FRANCHISEES AFFILIATED WITH AEFAI, WHO HAVE

THE RIGHT TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH THE AMERICAN

42

EXPRESS BRAND. FRANCHISEE ADVISORS EARN A HIGHER PAYOUT RATE, BUT

PAY THEIR OWN BUSINESS EXPENSES, SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AND STAFF,

INCLUDING ANY ASSOCIATE ADVISORS EMPLOYED BY THE FRANCHISEE.

APPROXIMATELY 26% OF AEFAI'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS ARE AMERICAN EXPRESS

EMPLOYEES; APPROXIMATELY 61% ARE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED FRANCHISEES; AND

APPROXIMATELY 13% ARE ASSOCIATE ADVISORS. AEFAI PAYS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THE REVENUE RECEIVED IN THE FORM OF FINANCIAL PLANNING FEES, WRAP ACCOUNT FEES,

SALES CHARGES AND 12B-1 DISTRIBUTION FEES TO ADVISORS FOR THEIR ROLE IN SERVING

CLIENTS. THE RATE OF COMMISSION AEFAI PAYS TO EACH ADVISOR IS DETERMINED BY A

SCHEDULE THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE TYPE OF SERVICE PROVIDED OR PRODUCT SOLD,

THE TYPE OF ADVISOR AFFILIATION AND OTHER CRITERIA.

DURING 2004, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUR RECRUITMENT, SELECTION

AND TRAINING OF EMPLOYEE ADVISORS, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN IMPROVED RETENTION OF

FIRST-YEAR ADVISORS. WE ALSO IMPROVED THE SERVICE AND TOOLS PROVIDED TO

FRANCHISEE ADVISORS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUED EFFORTS TO INCREASE OUR DEDICATED

FIELD FORCE TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND SERVE NEW CLIENTS AND

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE LARGE SALES FORCES OF CERTAIN COMPETITORS. AS NOTED

ABOVE, WE DID REALIZE A NET INCREASE IN THE FIELD FORCE IN 2004.

AEFA'S STRATEGY FOCUSES ON BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIGH-VALUE CLIENTS

IN THE MASS AFFLUENT SEGMENT -- INDIVIDUALS WITH $100,000 TO $1 MILLION IN

INVESTABLE ASSETS. IN MAY 2004, WE BEGAN THE NATIONWIDE ROLLOUT OF AMERICAN

EXPRESS GOLD FINANCIAL SERVICES TO OFFER PERSONALIZED SOLUTIONS TO RECOGNIZE

AND REWARD OUR CLIENTS WITH MORE THAN $100,000 INVESTED WITH US. CLIENTS WITH

OVER $500,000 INVESTED WITH US MAY QUALIFY FOR PLATINUM FINANCIAL SERVICES,

OFFERED BY A SUBSET OF SPECIALLY QUALIFIED FINANCIAL ADVISORS WHO ARE TRAINED TO

PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THESE CLIENTS' SPECIAL FINANCIAL NEEDS. CLIENTS MUST MEET

DETAILED ELIGIBILITY AND MAINTENANCE RULES TO QUALIFY FOR AND RETAIN GOLD OR

PLATINUM STATUS. THESE TIERED OFFERINGS PROVIDE A ONE-ON-ONE RELATIONSHIP WITH

ONE OF OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS, FRONT-OF-THE-LINE CUSTOMER SERVICE, ANNUAL FEE

WAIVER ON IRA ROLLOVERS, QUARTERLY FEE WAIVER ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ONE(R)

FINANCIAL ACCOUNT, UPGRADE TO THE HIGHEST TIER INTEREST RATE ON THE ONE

HIGH-YIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND PREFERRED PRICING AND BONUS RATES ON SPECIAL

PRODUCT OFFERS, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THOSE OFFERS. FINANCIAL PLANNING

SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR A SEPARATE FEE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER "RETAIL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES - FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES." IN ADDITION, GOLD AND

PLATINUM FINANCIAL SERVICES CLIENTS RECEIVE A FEE-WAIVED AMERICAN EXPRESS

PREFERRED REWARDS GOLD OR PLATINUM CARD(SM), RESPECTIVELY, WITH ACCESS TO ALL

THE PRIVILEGES AND SERVICES THAT CARD MEMBERSHIP PROVIDES.

ALLIANCES

AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF AEFA'S STRATEGY IS TO LEVERAGE THE CLIENT

RELATIONSHIPS OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES BY WORKING WITH MAJOR COMPANIES TO CREATE

ALLIANCES THAT HELP GENERATE NEW FINANCIAL SERVICES CLIENTS FOR US. IN 2004, WE

CONTINUED OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION ("COSTCO") AND

DELTA LOYALTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INC. ("DELTA") IN 2004 AND

43

CREATED NEW ALLIANCES WITH AMERICAN CENTURY SERVICES CORPORATION ("AMERICAN

CENTURY"), TARGET CORPORATION ("TARGET") AND MARRIOTT OWNERSHIP RESORTS, INC.

("MARRIOTT"). THE RELATIONSHIP WITH COSTCO OFFERS ADVISORS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

MARKET FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE SERVICES TO MILLIONS OF COSTCO MEMBERS

THROUGH VARIOUS MARKETING CHANNELS. THE DELTA MARKETING ALLIANCE PROVIDES US

WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO MARKET FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE SERVICES TO THE

MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS WHO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH DELTA AIR LINES THROUGH ITS

DELTA SKYMILES(R) PROGRAM, INCLUDING THOSE CONSUMERS WHO ALREADY CARRY THE

COBRANDED AMERICAN EXPRESS/DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARD. IN APRIL 2004, WE ENTERED

INTO A NEW MARKETING ALLIANCE WITH AMERICAN CENTURY. THIS ALLIANCE PROVIDES US

WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO MARKET OUR FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE SERVICES TO

SHAREHOLDERS OF AMERICAN CENTURY'S PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUND FAMILY. IN MAY 2004,

WE ESTABLISHED A RELATIONSHIP WITH TARGET THAT PROVIDES US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY

TO MARKET OUR FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE SERVICES TO TARGET CUSTOMERS. UNDER

OUR AGREEMENT WITH MARRIOTT, WHICH WAS ENTERED INTO IN NOVEMBER 2004, OUR

ADVISORS CONDUCT FINANCIAL EDUCATION SESSIONS AT VACATION OWNERSHIP PROPERTIES

MARKETED BY MARRIOTT UNDER ITS MARRIOTT VACATION CLUB INTERNATIONAL LABEL.

FINANCIAL SERVICES CENTER

IN 2004, WE ESTABLISHED THE FINANCIAL SERVICES CENTER, A SPECIAL CALL

CENTER FOR REMOTE-BASED SALES AND SERVICE. THE FINANCIAL SERVICES CENTER

PROVIDES CLIENT SERVICES FOR THOSE RETAIL CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO OR

DO NOT NEED A FACE-TO-FACE RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ADVISOR. FINANCIAL CONSULTANTS

IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES CENTER PROVIDE PERSONAL SERVICE AND GUIDANCE THROUGH

PHONE-BASED INTERACTIONS AND MAY PROVIDE PRODUCT CHOICES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

CLIENTS' NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES.

INSTITUTIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS

AEAMG PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO PENSION, PROFIT-SHARING,

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND ENDOWMENT FUNDS, THE ACCOUNTS OF LARGE- AND MEDIUM-SIZED

BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTAL CLIENTS, AS WELL AS THE ACCOUNTS OF HIGH-NET-WORTH

INDIVIDUALS AND SMALLER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, INCLUDING TAX-EXEMPT AND

NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AEAMG OFFERS INCLUDE THE

INVESTMENT OF FUNDS ON A DISCRETIONARY OR NON-DISCRETIONARY BASIS, AND RELATED

SERVICES INCLUDING TRADING, CASH MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING. AEAMG AND OTHER AEFC

AFFILIATES SHARE CERTAIN PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND TRADING PERSONNEL ACROSS

ENTITIES.

AEAMG OFFERS VARIOUS FIXED AND EQUITY INVESTMENT STRATEGIES FOR

INSTITUTIONAL SEPARATE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND ADVICE. THROUGH A SUBADVISORY

ARRANGEMENT WITH TINTL AND KENWOOD, AEAMG ALSO OFFERS CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL AND

U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AEAMG, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH ITS AFFILIATES,

MANAGED INSTITUTIONAL SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS (INCLUDING

ASSETS MANAGED OR ADMINISTERED ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES) OF

$6.8 BILLION COMPARED TO $9.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

44

FOR ITS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AEAMG GENERALLY RECEIVES FEES

BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. CLIENTS MAY ALSO PAY FEES

TO AEAMG BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR PORTFOLIO.

IDS LIFE COMPANIES GENERAL ACCOUNTS

AEFC AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES PROVIDE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES

FOR ASSETS HELD IN THE "GENERAL ACCOUNTS" OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES. THE GENERAL

ACCOUNT ASSETS ARE MANAGED ACCORDING TO A FIXED-INCOME STRATEGY DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE FOR A CONSOLIDATED AND TARGETED RATE OF RETURN ON INVESTMENTS WHILE

CONTROLLING RISK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AEFC MANAGED GENERAL ACCOUNT ASSETS ON

BEHALF OF IDS LIFE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES OF APPROXIMATELY $32 BILLION, WHICH WAS

UNCHANGED FROM THE END OF 2003.

TO GUIDE AEFC IN ITS MANAGEMENT OF THE GENERAL ACCOUNT ASSETS, AND IN

ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY INVESTMENT GUIDELINES, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES,

THROUGH THEIR RESPECTIVE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS' INVESTMENT COMMITTEES OR STAFF

FUNCTIONS, REVIEW MODELS PROJECTING DIFFERENT INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS,

RISK/RETURN MEASURES, AND THEIR EFFECT ON PROFITABILITY. THEY ALSO REVIEW THE

DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO BY TYPE AND CREDIT RISK SECTOR. THE

OBJECTIVE IS TO STRUCTURE THE INVESTMENT SECURITY PORTFOLIO IN THE GENERAL

ACCOUNTS TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR INSURANCE AND ANNUITY

PRODUCTS AND ACHIEVE TARGETED LEVELS OF PROFITABILITY WITHIN DEFINED RISK

PARAMETERS.

HEDGE FUNDS

AEAMG AND AEAMI PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE AND RELATED SERVICES TO PRIVATE,

POOLED INVESTMENT VEHICLES ORGANIZED AS LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, LIMITED LIABILITY

CORPORATIONS OR FOREIGN (NON-U.S.) ENTITIES. THESE FUNDS ARE EXEMPT FROM U.S.

FUND REGISTRATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 AND ARE ORGANIZED AS

EITHER DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN FUNDS. AEFC AFFILIATES ALSO SERVE AS INVESTMENT

ADVISERS TO SEVERAL SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS THAT OFFER A HEDGE FUND

INVESTMENT OPTION. AEFC ALSO PROVIDES INVESTMENT ADVICE AND RELATED SERVICES TO

AN SEC-REGISTERED CLOSED-END, NON-DIVERSIFIED MANAGEMENT COMPANY THAT IS A FUND

OF HEDGE FUNDS.

IN 2004, WE STRATEGICALLY ALIGNED OUR FUNDS TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF

THE MARKETPLACE BY ADDING FOUR NEW FUND STRATEGIES, INCLUDING INCREASING OUR

OFFERING OF OPPORTUNISTIC FUNDS, AND EXITING TWO FUND STRATEGIES. IN FEBRUARY

2004, WE ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF A GLOBAL FUND OF HEDGE FUNDS PLATFORM THAT

INCLUDES FUNDS OF HEDGE FUNDS MANAGED IN THE UNITED STATES AND SWITZERLAND. THIS

PLATFORM IS OPERATED BY BOTH AEB AND AEFA.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AEFC AFFILIATES MANAGED HEDGE FUND ASSETS (INCLUDING

SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS WITH A HEDGE FUND STRATEGY) TOTALING $2.2 BILLION.

INCLUDED IN THIS TOTAL IS $936 MILLION FROM FUNDS OF HEDGE FUND ASSETS THAT WERE

MIGRATED TO AEAMI FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK (CAYMAN).

FOR THEIR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AEFC AFFILIATES GENERALLY

RECEIVE FEES BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. DEPENDING ON

THE FUND, AEFC AFFILIATES MAY ALSO RECEIVE PERFORMANCE-BASED FEES.

45

CDOS/SLTS

AEAMG PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AS COLLATERAL MANAGER TO

SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLES THAT ISSUE COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS ("CDOS"),

WHICH ARE SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY A POOL OF ASSETS, TYPICALLY HIGH-YIELD

BONDS AND BANK LOANS. AEAMG ALSO PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO

SECURED LOAN TRUSTS ("SLTS"), WHICH PROVIDE RETURNS TO INVESTORS PRIMARILY BASED

ON THE PERFORMANCE OF AN UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO OF BANK LOANS. FOR ITS MANAGEMENT

OF CDOS AND SLTS, AEAMG EARNS FEES BASED ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND MAY ALSO

RECEIVE PERFORMANCE-BASED FEES. IN 2004, AEAMG ASSUMED THE MANAGEMENT OF THE

COLLATERAL POOL FOR ONE NEW CDO. AEAMG ALSO CEASED MANAGEMENT OF AN SLT THAT WAS

LIQUIDATED IN 2004.

AEAMG OR ONE OR MORE OTHER AEFC AFFILIATES HAS INVESTED ITS OWN MONEY IN

CDOS AND SLTS, INCLUDING IN RESIDUAL OR "EQUITY" INTERESTS, WHICH ARE ILLIQUID

AND THE MOST SUBORDINATED (AND ACCORDINGLY, RISKIEST AND MOST VOLATILE)

INTERESTS IN SUCH VEHICLES. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES AND AEFC ALSO HAVE AN

INTEREST IN A SECURITIZATION TRUST DISCUSSED BELOW, WHICH IS COMPRISED

PRINCIPALLY OF CDO SECURITIES. CDOS ARE ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2004, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE CDO RESIDUAL TRANCHES OWNED BY AEAMG OR ANOTHER

AEFA AFFILIATE BUT NOT CONSOLIDATED PURSUANT TO FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, AS

REVISED ("FIN 46") WAS $27 MILLION.

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' AND AEFC'S INVESTMENT RETURN ON A CDO CORRELATES

TO THE PERFORMANCE OF PORTFOLIOS OF HIGH-YIELD BONDS AND/OR BANK LOANS INCLUDED

IN THAT CDO. DETERIORATION IN THE VALUE OF HIGH-YIELD BONDS OR BANK LOANS WOULD

LIKELY RESULT IN DETERIORATION OF INVESTMENT RETURN ON THE RELEVANT CDO. IN THE

EVENT OF SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION OF A PORTFOLIO, THE RELEVANT CDO MAY BE

SUBJECT TO EARLY LIQUIDATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FURTHER DETERIORATION OF THE

INVESTMENT RETURN OR, IN SEVERE CASES, LOSS OF THE CDO CARRYING AMOUNT.

DETERIORATION OF A PORTFOLIO WOULD LIKELY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON COLLATERAL

MANAGEMENT FEES.

DURING 2001, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES AND AEFC PLACED A MAJORITY OF THEIR

RATED CDOS AND RELATED ACCRUED INTEREST, AS WELL AS A RELATIVELY MINOR AMOUNT OF

OTHER LIQUID SECURITIES, HAVING AN AGGREGATE BOOK VALUE AT SUCH TIME OF $905

MILLION, INTO A SECURITIZATION TRUST. IN RETURN, IDS LIFE COMPANIES AND AEFC

COMBINED RECEIVED A TOTAL OF $120 MILLION IN CASH (EXCLUDING TRANSACTION

EXPENSES) RELATING TO SALES TO UNAFFILIATED INVESTORS AND RETAINED INTERESTS IN

THE TRUST WITH ALLOCATED BOOK AMOUNTS AGGREGATING $785 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2004, THE RETAINED INTERESTS HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF $705 MILLION, OF WHICH

$523 MILLION IS CONSIDERED INVESTMENT GRADE. NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS

AEFA SUBSIDIARIES HAVE ANY OBLIGATIONS, CONTINGENT OR OTHERWISE, TO THE

UNAFFILIATED INVESTORS TO WHOM INTERESTS IN THE TRUST WERE SOLD, NOR DO THEY

PROVIDE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO THE TRUST.

COLLECTIVE FUNDS

AMERICAN EXPRESS TRUST COMPANY ("AETC"), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

AEFC, IS A MINNESOTA CHARTERED, LIMITED SERVICE TRUST COMPANY THAT PROVIDES

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS AND ALSO PROVIDES

THE SERVICES DESCRIBED UNDER "ADDITIONAL SERVICES -- RETIREMENT SERVICES" BELOW.

COLLECTIVE FUNDS ARE NON-SEC REGISTERED INVESTMENT FUNDS OFFERED PRIMARILY

THROUGH BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS SUCH AS

RETIREMENT, PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS. IN

46

SOME SITUATIONS, AETC MAY UTILIZE THE ASSISTANCE OF AN AFFILIATED OR

UNAFFILIATED INVESTMENT ADVISER IN MANAGING A PARTICULAR COLLECTIVE FUND. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004, AETC SERVED AS INVESTMENT MANAGER TO 47 COLLECTIVE FUNDS

COVERING A BROAD SPECTRUM OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. FOR ITS INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AETC RECEIVES FEES THAT ARE GENERALLY BASED UPON A

PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. AETC CLIENTS

TYPICALLY DO NOT PAY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES TO AETC BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE

OF THEIR PORTFOLIO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AETC HAD $12.1 BILLION IN COLLECTIVE

FUND ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT COMPARED TO $12.6 BILLION AT THE END OF 2003.

INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES - THREADNEEDLE

WE ALSO OFFER INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES THROUGH OUR

U.K.-BASED THREADNEEDLE SUBSIDIARY. THE THREADNEEDLE GROUP OF COMPANIES CONSISTS

ASSET MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING SEGREGATED ASSET MANAGEMENT, MUTUAL FUNDS

THROUGH ITS TINTL SUBSIDIARY, THREADNEEDLE ALSO OFFERS INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO U.S. INVESTMENT COMPANIES AND OTHER U.S. INSTITUTIONAL

CLIENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN AXP FUNDS AND VP FUNDS.

THE ACQUISITION OF THREADNEEDLE BY AEFC IN SEPTEMBER 2003 HAS HELPED

FACILITATE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM. THREADNEEDLE HAS BENEFITED FROM GROWTH IN ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT BOTH THROUGH NEW CLIENT BUSINESS AND ORGANIC MARKET GROWTH OF

EXISTING FUNDS.

THREADNEEDLE IS HEADQUARTERED IN LONDON AND HAS A BRANCH OFFICE IN

GERMANY, AND REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES IN AUSTRIA, FRANCE AND SWITZERLAND.

THREADNEEDLE HAS APPROXIMATELY 785 EMPLOYEES.

THREADNEEDLE'S DISTRIBUTION IS ORGANIZED ALONG THREE LINES: RETAIL,

INSTITUTIONAL AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES.

RETAIL. THE RETAIL BUSINESS LINE INCLUDES THREADNEEDLE'S U.K. MUTUAL FUND

FAMILY, WHICH RANKS AS THE THIRD LARGEST RETAIL FUND COMPLEX IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM IN TERMS OF RETAIL ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. THREADNEEDLE SELLS MUTUAL

FUNDS MOSTLY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY THROUGH FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES

AND INSTITUTIONS. THE RETAIL BUSINESS UNIT ALSO INCLUDES THREADNEEDLE'S HEDGE

FUNDS COMPRISING THREE LONG/SHORT EQUITY FUNDS AND ONE FIXED INCOME FUND.

INSTITUTIONAL. THREADNEEDLE'S INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS OFFERS TRADITIONAL

SEGREGATED ASSET MANAGEMENT TO U.K. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION FUNDS AND OTHER

47

MUTUAL FUND AND INSURANCE-BASED PRODUCTS TO PENSION CLIENTS. THREADNEEDLE

2004.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. THREADNEEDLE'S STRATEGIC ALLIANCES BUSINESS COMPRISES

THE ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THREADNEEDLE FOR THE ZURICH GROUP,

AND FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANIES AND CERTAIN OTHER CLIENTS. THE ZURICH GROUP

IS THREADNEEDLE'S SINGLE LARGEST CLIENT. THREADNEEDLE MANAGES ASSETS FOR THE

ZURICH GROUP FOR BOTH ITS U.K. AND INTERNATIONAL LIFE FUNDS AND FOR ITS GENERAL

INSURANCE ASSETS, AS WELL AS OFFERING THREADNEEDLE MANAGED FUNDS THROUGH

ZURICH'S SALES DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT AEFC

ENTERED INTO WITH THE ZURICH GROUP WHEN AEFC ACQUIRED THREADNEEDLE, THREADNEEDLE

WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE CERTAIN ASSETS OF ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES U.K., WHICH

INCLUDES A MAJORITY OF THREADNEEDLE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, SUBJECT TO ITS

MEETING STANDARD PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. THERE ARE UNDER SEVEN YEARS REMAINING

UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

THREADNEEDLE ALSO HAS A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN AN INSTITUTIONAL

MULTI-MANAGER BUSINESS (MM ASSET MANAGEMENT, FORMERLY KNOWN AS ATTICA ASSET

MANAGEMENT) WITH $1.1 BILLION UNDER MANAGEMENT. THIS BUSINESS MANAGES TWO

DUBLIN-BASED INSTITUTIONAL FUND-OF-FUNDS THAT ARE SOLD TO SMALLER PENSION FUND

CLIENTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THROUGH CONSULTING ACTUARY FIRMS. THREADNEEDLE

INTENDS TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THIS BUSINESS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL

AND MULTI-MANAGER MARKETS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

THREADNEEDLE EXPECTS TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHER PRODUCTS

FOR BOTH THE RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL MARKETS AS WELL AS TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS

TO ATTRACT NEW RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS. IN 2004, THREADNEEDLE WAS THE

FIRST GROUP TO LAUNCH U.K.-DOMICILED MUTUAL FUNDS WITH TRUE PERFORMANCE FEES IN

ITS NEW ACCELERANDO FUNDS AND INTRODUCED ITS FIRST FUND OF HEDGE FUNDS AIMED

PRIMARILY AT THE GERMAN RETAIL MARKET.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE THREADNEEDLE GROUP OF COMPANIES MANAGED $116.9

BILLION IN THE AGGREGATE COMPARED TO $95.6 BILLION AT THE END OF 2003.

ADDITIONAL SERVICES

RETIREMENT SERVICES

COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT FUND ASSETS, DESCRIBED ABOVE, AETC, OFTEN THROUGH THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT SERVICES ("AERS") BANNER, ALSO PROVIDES TRUSTEE,

CUSTODIAL, RECORDKEEPING, SECURITIES LENDING AND COMMON TRUST FUND SERVICES FOR

EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS, INCLUDING PENSION, PROFIT SHARING, 401(K)

48

IN 2004, WE INTRODUCED A RETIREMENT PLAN PRODUCT CALLED "NEXTPLAN" AIMED

AT RETIREMENT PLANS WITH BETWEEN $5 AND $50 MILLION IN ASSETS. THE NEXTPLAN

PRODUCT IS INTRODUCED TO PLAN SPONSORS BY THE AERS DIRECT SALES FORCE,

UNAFFILIATED BROKER-DEALERS, AND AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS. PLAN

THIRD-PARTY RECORDKEEPER.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AETC ACTED AS DIRECTED TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN OF 263

BENEFIT PLANS, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY $31.4 BILLION IN ASSETS MANAGED

IN ADDITION TO THE SERVICES DESCRIBED ABOVE, AETC ALSO ACTS AS CUSTODIAN,

RETAIL ASSETS OWNED, MANAGED AND ADMINISTERED BY AEFA.

AETC ALSO PROVIDES INSTITUTIONAL ASSET CUSTODIAL SERVICES TO AEFC

SERVICES THAT ARE GENERALLY BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET VALUE OF

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. AETC ALSO RECEIVES TRANSACTION-RELATED FEES FOR ITS

INSTITUTIONAL CUSTODY SERVICES.

FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND PLANNING SERVICES

AEFA'S FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND PLANNING SERVICES ("FEPS") GROUP PROVIDES

WORKPLACE FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND ADVISORY SERVICES PROGRAMS TO THE 401(K)

CLIENT BASE OF AERS AND AETC AND TO OTHER MAJOR CORPORATIONS AND SMALL

BUSINESSES. FEPS FOCUSES ON THE GOAL OF CREATING ADVISOR RELATIONSHIPS WITH

INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES OF CLIENT COMPANIES. IT TRAINS AND SUPPORTS ADVISORS

WORKING ON-SITE AT COMPANY LOCATIONS TO PRESENT EDUCATIONAL SEMINARS, CONDUCT

ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS AND PARTICIPATE IN CLIENT EDUCATIONAL EVENTS. IN 2004, WE

EXPANDED OUR ON-SITE ACTIVITIES WITH 401(K) CLIENTS AND INCREASED SALES OF

FINANCIAL EDUCATION RELATIONSHIPS TO COMPANIES THAT DO NOT HAVE A 401(K)

RELATIONSHIP WITH AERS.

WE ALSO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ADVICE SERVICE OFFERINGS, SUCH AS FEPS EXECUTIVE

FINANCIAL SERVICES, TAILORED TO DISCRETE EMPLOYEE SEGMENTS. THE GROWTH AND

SUCCESS OF FEPS IS CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND OUR BELIEF THAT

MARKETPLACE DEMAND FOR EMPLOYEE FINANCIAL EDUCATION IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGH,

PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CONTINUING TREND TOWARD INCREASED EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITY

FOR SELECTING RETIREMENT INVESTMENTS. AS THIS SERVICE NEED GROWS, SO TOO DOES

THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS SEEKING TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEE EDUCATION AND PLANNING

SERVICES.

COMPETITION - ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS

COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON COST,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, YIELD, DEPTH AND BREADTH OF PRODUCTS, CONVENIENCE,

SERVICE, RELIABILITY, SAFETY,

49

INNOVATION, DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, REPUTATION, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND INSURANCE

COMPANY RATINGS. REPUTATION AND BRAND INTEGRITY ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE

IMPORTANT AS THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY GENERALLY AND CERTAIN FIRMS IN PARTICULAR

HAVE COME UNDER REGULATORY AND MEDIA SCRUTINY. SEE "REGULATION - ASSET

ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS" BELOW. COMPETITION IN THIS INDUSTRY IS VERY

INTENSE. AEFA COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS BANKS,

SECURITIES BROKERS, MUTUAL FUNDS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. SOME OF THESE

INSTITUTIONS ARE LARGER, HAVE GREATER RESOURCES AND HAVE A GREATER GLOBAL

PRESENCE THAN AEFA. MANY OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALSO HAVE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES THAT INCREASINGLY CROSS OVER THE TRADITIONAL LINES THAT PREVIOUSLY

DISTINGUISHED ONE TYPE OF INSTITUTION FROM ANOTHER, THEREBY HEIGHTENING

COMPETITION FOR AEFA. THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER

ONLINE INVESTMENT AND INFORMATION SERVICES HAS ALSO AFFECTED THE COMPETITIVE

LANDSCAPE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

FOLLOWING ARE COMPETITIVE FACTORS RELATED TO SPECIFIC PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH OUR ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS BUSINESS.

ASSET MANAGEMENT. AEFA COMPETES AGAINST A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF LARGER

FIRMS TO ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN

THE ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS INCLUDE.

-     THE QUALITY, REPUTATION AND "TRACK RECORD" OF PORTFOLIO MANAGERS;

-     RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE;

-     GLOBAL CAPABILITIES;

-     THE RANGE OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES OFFERED;

-     THE ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MARKET INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES;

-     THE QUALITY AND TIMELINESS OF CLIENT SERVICE; AND

-     FEE ARRANGEMENTS.

AEFA ALSO FACES INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY DEPENDS UPON OUR

ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SKILLED AND HIGH PERFORMING INVESTMENT

PROFESSIONALS AND NON-INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS WHO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE

ADMINISTRATION OF OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS.

MUTUAL FUNDS. THE AXP FUNDS FACE COMPETITION FROM NON-PROPRIETARY FUNDS,

INCLUDING FUNDS THAT HAVE NO SALES CHARGE ("NO-LOAD" FUNDS), FUNDS DISTRIBUTED

THROUGH INDEPENDENT BROKERAGE FIRMS AND EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS. MUTUAL FUNDS ALSO

FACE COMPETITION FROM AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS.

THE COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE SALE OF MUTUAL FUNDS INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING.

-     RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE;

-     THE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED;

-     SALES CHARGES PAID;

-     ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES;

-     THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE;

-     THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A NETWORK OF THIRD-PARTY

DISTRIBUTORS;

-     CONVENIENCE TO THE INVESTOR;

-     THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; AND

50

-     GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, FOR MUTUAL FUNDS, HIGH RATINGS FROM RATING SERVICES, SUCH AS

MORNINGSTAR AND LIPPER, OR FAVORABLE MENTION IN FINANCIAL PUBLICATIONS MAY

INFLUENCE SALES AND LEAD TO INCREASES IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. AS A MUTUAL

FUND'S ASSETS INCREASE, MANAGEMENT FEE REVENUE INCREASES AND THE FUND MAY

ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS BECAUSE OF

POTENTIAL RESULTING REDUCTIONS IN THE FUND'S EXPENSE RATIO.

ANNUITIES. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' ANNUITY BUSINESS COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS

OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN BANKS, SECURITIES BROKERAGE FIRMS,

INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT MARKET

ANNUITIES, MUTUAL FUNDS AND OTHER RETIREMENT-ORIENTED PRODUCTS. COMPETITIVE

FACTORS AFFECTING THE SALE OF ANNUITIES INCLUDE.

-     MORTALITY, EXPENSE AND OTHER CONTRACT CHARGES;

-     INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE;

-     FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS FROM RATING AGENCIES SUCH AS A.M. BEST;

-     THE BREADTH, QUALITY AND DESIGN OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED;

-     THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS;

-     REPUTATION AND RECOGNITION IN THE MARKETPLACE;

-     DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES AND COMPENSATION;

-     THE LEVEL OF INTEREST CREDITING RATES; AND

-     THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

WITH RESPECT TO VARIABLE ANNUITIES, CUSTOMERS ALSO FOCUS ON GUARANTEED

PAYMENT FEATURES THAT HELP TO INSULATE THEM FROM EQUITY MARKET RISK.

RETAIL DISTRIBUTION. OUR AEFAI SUBSIDIARY COMPETES WITH FINANCIAL PLANNING

FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING MEMBERS OF THE FIELD FORCE.

RETIREMENT SERVICES. THE RETIREMENT SERVICES BUSINESS IS HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. AERS COMPETES AGAINST A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF LARGER FIRMS IN

SEEKING TO ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN

THIS BUSINESS INCLUDE FEES, RECORDKEEPING AND TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND CLIENT SERVICING.

REGULATION - ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS

AEFA'S ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS BUSINESS IS REGULATED BY THE

SEC, NASD, THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, THE NATIONAL FUTURES

ASSOCIATION, STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS AND STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS. CERTAIN

ASPECTS OF AEFA'S RETIREMENT SERVICES BUSINESS ARE REGULATED BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ("DOL") AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY ("TREASURY"). AS

HAS THE REST OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, AEFA HAS EXPERIENCED, AND

BELIEVES IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO, INCREASED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF

THE SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES INDUSTRIES AT ALL LEVELS. DURING THE PAST YEAR,

MUTUAL FUNDS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS WERE REQUIRED BY THE SEC TO ADOPT AND

IMPLEMENT WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO

51

PREVENT VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND TO DESIGNATE A CHIEF

COMPLIANCE OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

THE SEC AND NASD HAVE ALSO HEIGHTENED REQUIREMENTS FOR AND CONTINUED SCRUTINY OF

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS OF

BROKER-DEALERS, INCLUDING CERTIFICATION BY SENIOR OFFICERS REGARDING THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROCEDURES AND PROGRAMS. THE SEC AND NASD RECENTLY

ADOPTED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING REVENUE SHARING, MARKET TIMING,

INCREASED DISCLOSURES OF BREAKPOINT DISCOUNTS IN MUTUAL FUND PROSPECTUSES AND AN

INVESTMENT ADVISER CODE OF ETHICS. BECAUSE THESE NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

HAVE BEEN EITHER RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED OR ADOPTED, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY OVER HOW

THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY IMPACT AEFA'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE

EXTENT TO WHICH INCREASED TECHNOLOGY EXPENDITURES MAY BE NECESSARY TO COMPLY

WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE SEC AND NASD PROPOSED REVISIONS TO

RULES ON TRADING AND MARKET STRUCTURE FOR BROKER-DEALERS, SUITABILITY

REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIABLE ANNUITY SALES, AS WELL AS INCREASED TRANSACTION

DISCLOSURE INFORMATION ON CUSTOMER CONFIRMATIONS. WHILE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES MAY

ULTIMATELY BE ADOPTED, THESE INITIATIVES COULD AFFECT INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS'

RESULTS, INCLUDING AEFA'S, IN FUTURE PERIODS.

AEFAI DOES BUSINESS AS A BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER IN ALL 50

STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. AEFAI IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER AND

INVESTMENT ADVISOR REGULATED BY THE SEC AND IS A MEMBER OF THE NASD. AEFAI'S

FINANCIAL ADVISORS MUST OBTAIN ALL REQUIRED STATE AND NASD LICENSES AND

REGISTRATIONS. AEIS IS ALSO REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER WITH THE SEC, IS A

MEMBER OF THE NASD AND THE CHICAGO STOCK EXCHANGE AND IS REGISTERED WITH

APPROPRIATE STATES.

AEFC AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES ALSO DO BUSINESS AS REGISTERED INVESTMENT

ADVISERS AND ARE REGULATED BY THE SEC AND STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS WHERE

REQUIRED. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY STATE INSURANCE

REGULATORS AS DESCRIBED UNDER "INSURANCE - REGULATION OF INSURANCE." IDS LIFE IS

ALSO REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER WITH THE SEC AND IS A MEMBER OF THE NASD.

AETC IS PRIMARILY REGULATED BY THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

(BANKING DIVISION) AND IS SUBJECT TO NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER MINNESOTA

LAW. AETC MAY NOT ACCEPT DEPOSITS OR MAKE PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL LOANS. AS A

PROVIDER OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS AND IRAS,

CERTAIN ASPECTS OF AEFA'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE ACTIVITIES OF AETC, FALL

WITHIN THE COMPLIANCE OVERSIGHT OF THE DOL AND THE TREASURY, PARTICULARLY THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 ("ERISA") AND THE TAX REPORTING

REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO SUCH ACCOUNTS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ADDS TO THE COST

AND COMPLEXITY OF OPERATING AEFA'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE SEC, DOL,

TREASURY, SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS AND STATE SECURITIES AND INSURANCE

REGULATORS MAY CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS,

WHICH MAY RESULT IN CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS OR

SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A BROKER-DEALER OR AN INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ITS

OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS ALSO CAN BRING COMPLAINTS AGAINST

AEFA. BECAUSE AEFA IS STRUCTURED AS A FRANCHISE SYSTEM, IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND STATE FRANCHISE REQUIREMENTS.

52

AS HAS BEEN WIDELY REPORTED, THE SEC, THE NASD AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS

GENERAL HAVE BROUGHT NUMEROUS ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS CHALLENGING SEVERAL MUTUAL

FUND INDUSTRY PRACTICES, INCLUDING LATE TRADING (ALLOWING MUTUAL FUND CUSTOMERS

TO RECEIVE 4:00 PM ET PRICES FOR ORDERS PLACED OR CONFIRMED AFTER 4:00 PM ET),

MARKET TIMING (ABUSIVE RAPID TRADING IN MUTUAL FUND SHARES), DISCLOSURE OF

REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS (PAYMENTS BY FUND ADVISERS OR COMPANIES TO

BROKERAGE FIRMS WHO AGREE TO SELL THOSE FUNDS), AND INAPPROPRIATE SALES OF (NO

FRONT END LOAD) CLASS B SHARES. AEFA HAS RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND

HAS BEEN CONTACTED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES CONCERNING ITS PRACTICES AND IS

COOPERATING FULLY WITH THESE INQUIRIES. IN MAY 2004, AEFAI RECEIVED NOTIFICATION

FROM THE NASD INDICATING THAT IT HAD MADE A PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION TO

RECOMMEND ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST AEFAI FOR POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SEC AND THE NASD.

THE NASD'S ALLEGATIONS RELATE TO AEFAI'S REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS DESCRIBED

UNDER "RETAIL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES -- NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS" ABOVE. IN

FEBRUARY 2005, THE NEW HAMPSHIRE BUREAU OF SECURITIES REGULATION FILED A

PETITION ALLEGING THAT AEFAI FAILED TO DISCLOSE REVENUE SHARING AND DIRECTED

BROKERAGE PAYMENTS, INCENTIVES FOR ADVISORS TO SELL PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND

OTHER ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. AEFAI ALSO HAS SETTLED AN NASD ENFORCEMENT

ACTION REGARDING MUTUAL FUND BREAKPOINTS (DISCOUNTS FROM SALES CHARGES ON MUTUAL

FUND PURCHASES). YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT THESE ISSUES IN THE "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"

SECTION.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE INSURANCE-RELATED REGULATION OF AEFA'S ANNUITIES

BUSINESS CAN BE FOUND UNDER "REGULATION - INSURANCE" BELOW.

INSURANCE

IDS LIFE AND IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES,

COLLECTIVELY, ARE THE ISSUERS OF A VARIETY OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING LIFE

INSURANCE, DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE, LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE, AND PROPERTY

AND CASUALTY INSURANCE. IDS LIFE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO THE ISSUERS OF

THE ANNUITY PRODUCTS DESCRIBED UNDER "ASSET ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS -

RETAIL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES - ANNUITIES." THE INSURANCE PRODUCTS WE PROVIDE ARE

IMPORTANT PRODUCTS TO AEFA'S OVERALL BUSINESS. APPROXIMATELY 24% OF AEFA'S

REVENUES AND 30% OF AEFA'S PRE-TAX INCOME IN 2004 WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

INSURANCE BUSINESS. AEFA'S INSURANCE BUSINESSES GENERATE INCOME FROM THE SPREAD

BETWEEN THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' EARNINGS ON THE INVESTMENT OF GENERAL ACCOUNT

ASSETS AND THE INTEREST RATES CREDITED TO CONTRACT OWNERS FIXED ACCOUNTS, AND

FROM FEES AND CHARGES UNDER THE POLICIES IT ISSUES, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES

AND THE COST OF INSURANCE.

IDS LIFE COMPANIES

IDS LIFE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE ISSUERS OF VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE,

UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE, TRADITIONAL LIFE INSURANCE, INCLUDING WHOLE LIFE AND

TERM LIFE, DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE AND LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. A WHOLLY

OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AEFC, IDS LIFE IS A STOCK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ORGANIZED

UNDER MINNESOTA LAW. IDS LIFE HAS FOUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES: IDS LIFE

INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK, A NEW YORK STOCK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("IDS

LIFE OF NEW YORK"); AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, AN ARIZONA

53

STOCK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE"); AMERICAN ENTERPRISE

LIFE, AN INDIANA STOCK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY; AND AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE, A

NEW YORK STOCK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY. FOR CONVENIENCE, WE REFER TO IDS LIFE AND

ITS FOUR INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES AS THE "IDS LIFE COMPANIES" AND

INDIVIDUALLY AS AN "IDS LIFE COMPANY."

-     IDS LIFE ISSUES INSURANCE AND ANNUITY PRODUCTS TO RESIDENTS OF THE

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND ALL STATES EXCEPT NEW YORK.

-     IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ISSUES INSURANCE AND ANNUITY PRODUCTS TO NEW

YORK RESIDENTS.

-     AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE ISSUES ITS ANNUITY PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO

CONSUMERS, GENERALLY PERSONS HOLDING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD,

OUTSIDE NEW YORK.

-     AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE ISSUES FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITY

CONTRACTS TO NEW YORK RESIDENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND INDEPENDENT BROKER-DEALERS, AND ALSO MARKETS

DIRECTLY TO PERSONS GENERALLY HOLDING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD.

-     AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE ISSUES FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACTS

PRIMARILY THROUGH REGIONAL AND NATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND

REGIONAL AND/OR INDEPENDENT BROKER-DEALERS, IN ALL STATES EXCEPT NEW

YORK.

INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND FEATURES

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES ISSUE A WIDE RANGE OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS, EACH

DESCRIBED BELOW. IDS LIFE'S SALES OF INDIVIDUAL LIFE INSURANCE IN 2004, AS

MEASURED BY SCHEDULED ANNUAL PREMIUMS AND EXCLUDING LUMP SUM AND EXCESS

PREMIUMS, CONSISTED OF 87% VARIABLE LIFE, 43% UNIVERSAL LIFE AND 10% TERM AND

WHOLE LIFE, BASED ON YEAR-END CASH SALES REPORTS. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES ISSUE

ONLY NON-PARTICIPATING POLICIES, WHICH DO NOT PAY DIVIDENDS TO POLICYHOLDERS

FROM THE INSURER'S EARNINGS.

ASSETS SUPPORTING POLICY VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH FIXED ACCOUNT LIFE

INSURANCE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THOSE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH FIXED ACCOUNT

INVESTMENT OPTIONS UNDER VARIABLE INSURANCE PRODUCTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "FIXED

ACCOUNTS"), ARE PART OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' GENERAL ACCOUNTS. UNDER FIXED

ACCOUNTS EACH IDS LIFE COMPANY BEARS THE INVESTMENT RISK. MORE INFORMATION ON

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES GENERAL ACCOUNTS IS FOUND IN THE "INSTITUTIONAL PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES - IDS LIFE COMPANIES GENERAL ACCOUNTS" SECTION UNDER "ASSET

ACCUMULATION AND INVESTMENTS" ABOVE.

VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE. IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S BIGGEST

SELLING LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. VARIABLE

LIFE INSURANCE PROVIDES LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE ALONG WITH INVESTMENT RETURNS

LINKED TO UNDERLYING INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS OF THE POLICYHOLDER'S CHOICE, OPTIONS

WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE VP FUNDS DISCUSSED ABOVE AS WELL AS NON-PROPRIETARY FUNDS.

THESE PRODUCTS ALSO OFFER A FIXED ACCOUNT INVESTMENT OPTION WITH GUARANTEED

MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATES RANGING FROM 4.0% TO 4.5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, IDS LIFE RANKED SECOND IN VARIABLE LIFE

INSURANCE SALES ON THE BASIS OF PREMIUMS, ACCORDING TO THE VALUE SURVEY PROVIDED

BY TILLINGHAST, A CONSULTING FIRM THAT PROVIDES RESEARCH, CONSULTING AND OTHER

SERVICES TO INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES WORLDWIDE.

54

UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE. IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S UNIVERSAL

LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS PROVIDE LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND CASH VALUE THAT

INCREASES BY A FIXED INTEREST RATE. THE RATE IS PERIODICALLY RESET AT THE

DISCRETION OF THE ISSUING COMPANY SUBJECT TO CERTAIN POLICY TERMS RELATIVE TO

MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATES. POLICIES PROVIDE GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST

CREDITING RATES RANGING FROM 4% TO 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

TRADITIONAL LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS. IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S

TRADITIONAL LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS INCLUDE WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE AND TERM LIFE

INSURANCE. WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE COMBINES A DEATH BENEFIT WITH A CASH VALUE THAT

GENERALLY INCREASES GRADUALLY IN AMOUNT OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS AND DOES NOT PAY

A DIVIDEND (NON-PARTICIPATING). IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK HAVE SOLD VERY

LITTLE TRADITIONAL WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE IN RECENT YEARS. TERM LIFE INSURANCE

PROVIDES ONLY A DEATH BENEFIT, DOES NOT BUILD UP CASH VALUE AND DOES NOT PAY A

DIVIDEND. THE POLICYHOLDER CHOOSES THE TERM OF COVERAGE WITH GUARANTEED PREMIUMS

AT THE TIME OF ISSUE. DURING THE CHOSEN TERM, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK

CANNOT RAISE PREMIUM RATES EVEN IF CLAIMS EXPERIENCE WERE TO DETERIORATE. AT THE

END OF THE CHOSEN TERM, COVERAGE CONTINUES WITH HIGHER PREMIUMS UNTIL THE

MAXIMUM AGE IS ATTAINED, AT WHICH POINT THE POLICY EXPIRES WITH NO VALUE.

DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ALSO ISSUE

DISABILITY INCOME ("DI") INSURANCE. DI INSURANCE PROVIDES MONTHLY BENEFITS TO

INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNABLE TO EARN INCOME AT EITHER THEIR OCCUPATION AT TIME OF

DISABILITY ("OWN OCCUPATION") OR AT ANY SUITABLE OCCUPATION ("ANY OCCUPATION").

DEPENDING UPON OCCUPATIONAL AND MEDICAL UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, APPLICANTS FOR DI

INSURANCE CAN CHOOSE "OWN OCCUPATION" AND "ANY OCCUPATION" COVERAGE FOR VARYING

BENEFIT PERIODS UP TO AGE 65. APPLICANTS MAY ALSO CHOOSE VARIOUS BENEFIT RIDERS

TO HELP THEM INTEGRATE INDIVIDUAL DI INSURANCE BENEFITS WITH SOCIAL SECURITY OR

SIMILAR BENEFIT PLANS AND TO HELP THEM PROTECT THEIR DI INSURANCE BENEFITS FROM

THE RISK OF INFLATION. IDS LIFE BELIEVES IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN THE DI

INSURANCE MARKET.

LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE

OF NEW YORK GENERALLY DISCONTINUED UNDERWRITING LONG-TERM CARE ("LTC")

INSURANCE. ALTHOUGH NEW PRODUCT SALES WERE GENERALLY DISCONTINUED DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK RETAINED 50% OF THE

RISK ON EXISTING CONTRACTS AND CEDED THE REMAINING 50% OF THE RISK TO GENERAL

ELECTRIC CAPITAL ASSURANCE COMPANY, ONE OF THE GENWORTH FINANCIAL INSURANCE

COMPANIES ("GECA"). IN ADDITION, IN MAY 2003, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK

BEGAN OUTSOURCING CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION ON THEIR EXISTING BLOCK OF LTC POLICIES

TO GECA.

IN 2004, IDS LIFE FILED FOR APPROVAL TO IMPLEMENT RATE INCREASES ON ITS

EXISTING BLOCK OF NURSING HOME ONLY INDEMNITY LTC INSURANCE POLICIES.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RATE INCREASES BEGAN IN EARLY 2005 AND WILL CONTINUE

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS REGULATORY APPROVALS ARE OBTAINED.

OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS NOW SELL ONLY NON-PROPRIETARY LTC INSURANCE,

PRIMARILY PRODUCTS OFFERED BY GECA. IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, ADVISORS MAY SELL

LTC PRODUCTS OF OTHER UNAFFILIATED INSURERS.

55

DISTRIBUTION OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES SELL INSURANCE PRODUCTS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH

AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS. IN TURN, OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS OFFER INSURANCE

PRODUCTS ISSUED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES, BUT DO OFFER

INSURANCE PRODUCTS OF OTHER UNAFFILIATED CARRIERS IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU

CAN FIND A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF AEFAI'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS IN THE "RETAIL

DISTRIBUTION - FINANCIAL ADVISORS" SECTION UNDER "ASSET ACCUMULATION AND

INVESTMENTS" ABOVE.

LIABILITIES AND RESERVES

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES MUST MAINTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESERVES TO COVER

THE INSURANCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSURANCE PRODUCTS THEY ISSUE.

GENERALLY, RESERVES REPRESENT ESTIMATED ASSETS THAT THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES NEED

TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR FUTURE BENEFITS AND EXPENSES. YOU CAN FIND A

DISCUSSION OF LIABILITIES AND RESERVES RELATED TO OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS IN NOTE

1 TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER "INSURANCE AND

ANNUITY RESERVES" ON PAGES 89-90 OF OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTION OF SUCH REPORT IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

THE IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES' DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS ("DAC")

REPRESENT THE COSTS OF ACQUIRING NEW BUSINESS, PRINCIPALLY DIRECT SALES

COMMISSIONS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTION AND UNDERWRITING COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN

DEFERRED ON THE SALE OF INSURANCE AND THE ANNUITY PRODUCTS DESCRIBED IN THE

"RETAIL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES - ANNUITIES" SECTION UNDER "ASSET ACCUMULATION

AND INVESTMENTS" ABOVE. THESE COSTS ARE DEFERRED TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE

RECOVERABLE FROM FUTURE PROFITS. DAC ARE AMORTIZED OVER PERIODS APPROXIMATING

THE LIVES OF THE BUSINESS, PRINCIPALLY AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUMS OR ESTIMATED

GROSS PROFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTS.

YOU CAN FIND A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF DAC ON PAGES 35-36, PAGES 59-60 AND

PAGES 87-88 OF OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTION OF SUCH

REPORT IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

REINSURANCE

IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK REINSURE A PORTION OF THE INSURANCE

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR LIFE AND LTC INSURANCE PRODUCTS THROUGH REINSURANCE

AGREEMENTS WITH UNAFFILIATED INSURANCE COMPANIES. REINSURANCE IS USED IN ORDER

TO LIMIT LOSSES, REDUCE EXPOSURE TO LARGE RISKS, PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY

FOR FUTURE GROWTH AND TO EFFECT BUSINESS-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS. IDS LIFE AND IDS

LIFE OF NEW YORK EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF REINSURERS TO MINIMIZE

EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURER INSOLVENCIES. IDS LIFE AND IDS

LIFE OF NEW YORK REMAIN PRIMARILY LIABLE AS THE DIRECT INSURERS ON ALL RISKS

REINSURED.

GENERALLY, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK REINSURE 90% OF THE DEATH

BENEFIT LIABILITY RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL VARIABLE, UNIVERSAL, AND TERM LIFE

INSURANCE PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK TYPICALLY

RETAIN, AND ARE AT RISK FOR, AT MOST, 10% OF EACH POLICY'S DEATH BENEFIT FROM

THE FIRST DOLLAR OF COVERAGE FOR NEW SALES OF THESE POLICIES. IDS LIFE BEGAN

REINSURING RISKS AT THIS LEVEL DURING 2001 FOR TERM

56

LIFE INSURANCE AND 2002 FOR VARIABLE AND UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE. IDS LIFE OF

NEW YORK BEGAN REINSURING RISKS AT THIS LEVEL DURING 2002 FOR TERM LIFE

INSURANCE AND 2003 FOR VARIABLE AND UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE. POLICIES ISSUED

PRIOR TO THESE DATES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THESE SAME REINSURANCE LEVELS.

GENERALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIFE INSURANCE RISK RETAINED BY IDS LIFE AND

IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK IS $750,000 ON ANY POLICY INSURING A SINGLE LIFE AND $1.5

MILLION ON ANY FLEXIBLE PREMIUM SURVIVORSHIP VARIABLE LIFE POLICY. FOR EXISTING

LTC POLICIES, IDS LIFE (AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK FOR 1996 AND LATER ISSUES)

RETAINED 50% OF THE RISK AND CEDED THE REMAINING 50% RISK TO GECA. RISK ON

VARIABLE LIFE AND UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES IS REINSURED ON A YEARLY RENEWABLE

TERM BASIS. RISK ON RECENT TERM LIFE AND LTC POLICIES IS REINSURED ON A

COINSURANCE BASIS, A TYPE OF REINSURANCE IN WHICH THE REINSURER PARTICIPATES

PROPORTIONATELY IN ALL MATERIAL RISKS AND PREMIUMS ASSOCIATED WITH A POLICY.

IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK RETAIN ALL RISK FOR CLAIMS ON DISABILITY

INCOME CONTRACTS. RISK IS CURRENTLY MANAGED BY LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF DISABILITY

INSURANCE WRITTEN ON ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ALSO

RETAIN ALL RISK ON ACCIDENTAL DEATH BENEFIT CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF PREMIUM

PROVISIONS.

RATINGS

IDS LIFE RECEIVES RATINGS FROM INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES. GENERALLY, ITS

FOUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT RECEIVE AN INDIVIDUAL RATING, BUT RECEIVE THE

SAME RATING AS IDS LIFE. THESE AGENCIES EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS AND

CLAIMS-PAYING ABILITY OF INSURANCE COMPANIES BASED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

FACTORS. THE RATINGS REFLECT EACH AGENCY'S ESTIMATION OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES'

ABILITY TO MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS MAKING ANNUITY PAYOUTS AND

PAYING DEATH BENEFITS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS TO CONTRACT HOLDERS, AS WELL AS

MORE GENERALLY, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND OPERATING

PERFORMANCE. AS SUCH, THE RATINGS RELATE TO THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' GENERAL

ACCOUNTS AND NOT TO THE MANAGEMENT OR PERFORMANCE OF THE VARIABLE ACCOUNTS OF

THE CONTRACTS.

RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO MAINTAINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES. LOWERING OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' RATINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THEIR ABILITY TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS AND COULD LEAD TO

INCREASED SURRENDERS OF THEIR PRODUCTS. RATING AGENCIES CONTINUALLY REVIEW THE

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CONDITION OF INSURERS. AS OF THE END OF 2004, IDS LIFE

WAS RATED "A+" (SUPERIOR) BY A.M. BEST COMPANY, INC. AND ITS CLAIMS-PAYING

ABILITY/FINANCIAL STRENGTH WAS RATED "AA3" (EXCELLENT) BY MOODY'S INVESTORS

SERVICE, INC. ("MOODY'S"), AND "AA" (VERY STRONG) BY FITCH. ON FEBRUARY 1, 2005,

A.M. BEST PLACED THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATING OF A+ UNDER

REVIEW WITH NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS AND FITCH LOWERED IDS LIFE COMPANIES'

FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATING TO "AA-" AND PLACED THEM ON "RATING WATCH NEGATIVE"

FOLLOWING THE COMPANY'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT INTENDS TO PURSUE A SPIN-OFF OF ITS

FULL OWNERSHIP OF AEFC, THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE SPIN-OFF, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL

TO AEFA'S INSURANCE BUSINESSES TO CONFIRM ITS CURRENT FINANCIAL STRENGTH

RATINGS.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS ("NAIC") DEFINES

RISK-BASED CAPITAL ("RBC") REQUIREMENTS FOR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE RBC

REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BE USED AS MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THE NAIC AND

STATES TO IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MERIT FURTHER REGULATORY ACTION. AT DECEMBER

31, 2004, IDS LIFE HAD TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION ON

A STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS. THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, IDS LIFE'S

PRIMARY INSURANCE REGULATOR, REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM

RBC CALLED THE "AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL." IF TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL FELL BELOW

THE AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL, THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WOULD BE

AUTHORIZED TO EXERCISE MANAGEMENT CONTROL OVER IDS LIFE. FOR IDS LIFE, THE

AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL RBC WAS $372.9 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

IN ADDITION, IDS LIFE, LIKE OTHER LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES, IS EXPECTED TO

MAINTAIN CAPITAL ABOVE THE LEVEL AT WHICH IDS LIFE WOULD REQUIRE IT TO FILE AN

ACTION PLAN WITH THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. THIS IS REFERRED TO AS

THE "COMPANY ACTION LEVEL." FOR IDS LIFE, THE COMPANY ACTION LEVEL RBC WAS

$745.9 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES MAINTAIN LEVELS OF RBC IN

EXCESS OF THE AUTHORIZED CONTROL AND COMPANY ACTION LEVELS REQUIRED BY THEIR

STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS.

IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY

IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, AMEX ASSURANCE

COMPANY ("AMEX ASSURANCE") (COLLECTIVELY, THE "PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES"),

OFFER AUTO, HOMEOWNERS AND AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD-RELATED INSURANCE PRODUCTS. IDS

PROPERTY CASUALTY, A SUBSIDIARY OF AEFC, IS A STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY ORGANIZED

UNDER THE LAWS OF WISCONSIN. AMEX ASSURANCE IS A STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY

ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF ILLINOIS.

THE PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES PROVIDE PERSONAL AUTO AND HOMEOWNER'S

COVERAGE TO CLIENTS IN 37 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. AMEX ASSURANCE

ALSO PROVIDES CERTAIN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD-RELATED INSURANCE PRODUCTS SUCH AS

TRAVEL ACCIDENT INSURANCE. THE PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS

THROUGH ALLIANCES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AFFINITY GROUPS, SUCH AS ALUMNI

ASSOCIATIONS, AND DIRECTLY TO AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS AND THE GENERAL

PUBLIC. THE PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES HAVE A MAJOR DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH

COSTCO INSURANCE AGENCY, INC., COSTCO'S AFFILIATED INSURANCE AGENCY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004, THIS ARRANGEMENT OFFERED AUTO INSURANCE IN 36 STATES AND THE

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE IN 35 STATES TO COSTCO MEMBERS.

THE PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES RECEIVE TWO RATINGS FROM A.M. BEST, ONE

RELATED TO AMEX ASSURANCE AS A SEPARATE COMPANY AND ONE FOR THE COMBINED

PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES. THE RATING ASSIGNED IS DEVELOPED FROM AN IN-DEPTH

EVALUATION OF A COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH, OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND

BUSINESS PROFILE. BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET

ITS CURRENT AND ONGOING OBLIGATIONS TO ITS POLICYHOLDERS AND INCLUDES ANALYSIS

OF THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL ADEQUACY. THE EVALUATION OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE

CENTERS ON THE STABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SOURCES OF

EARNINGS. THE ANALYSIS OF BUSINESS PROFILE REVIEWS THE COMPANY'S MIX OF

BUSINESS, MARKET POSITION AND DEPTH AND EXPERIENCE OF MANAGEMENT. AS OF THE END

OF 2004, BOTH AMEX ASSURANCE AND THE COMBINED PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES

RECEIVED A RATINGS (EXCELLENT) BY A.M. BEST.

REGULATION - INSURANCE

THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (INSURANCE DIVISION), THE INDIANA

DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, THE WISCONSIN

OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE AND THE ILLINOIS INSURANCE DEPARTMENT

(COLLECTIVELY, AND WITH THE NEW YORK INSURANCE DEPARTMENT, "DOMICILIARY

REGULATORS") REGULATE IDS LIFE, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE, AMERICAN PARTNERS

LIFE, AND IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY AND AMEX ASSURANCE, RESPECTIVELY. THE NEW YORK

STATE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE REGULATES AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF

NEW YORK. IN ADDITION TO BEING REGULATED BY THEIR DOMICILIARY REGULATORS, THE

IDS LIFE COMPANIES AND THE PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES ARE ALSO REGULATED BY

EACH OF THE INSURANCE REGULATORS IN THE STATES WHERE EACH IS AUTHORIZED TO

TRANSACT THE BUSINESS OF INSURANCE. THESE OTHER STATES ALSO REGULATE SUCH

MATTERS AS THE LICENSING OF SALES PERSONNEL AND, IN SOME CASES, THE MARKETING

AND CONTENTS OF INSURANCE POLICIES AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF

SUCH REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS AND

CONTRACT HOLDERS. FINANCIAL REGULATION OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES AND THE

PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES IS EXTENSIVE, AND THEIR FINANCIAL AND INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS INTERCOMPANY DIVIDENDS, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND

INVESTMENT ACTIVITY) ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO PRE-NOTIFICATION AND CONTINUING

EVALUATION BY THE DOMICILIARY REGULATORS. VIRTUALLY ALL STATES REQUIRE

PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ASSESS FEES TO INSURANCE

COMPANIES IN ORDER TO FUND CLAIMS OF POLICYHOLDERS AND CONTRACT OWNERS OF

INSOLVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES.

INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING

REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL SCRUTINY. NUMEROUS STATE AND FEDERAL

REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE COMMENCED INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING SALES AND MARKETING

PRACTICES, COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS AND ANTICOMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES, AND MARKET

TIMING AND LATE TRADING IN CONNECTION WITH INSURANCE, ANNUITY AND MUTUAL FUND

PRODUCTS. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES AND THE PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN

CONTACTED BY REGULATORY AGENCIES FOR INFORMATION RELATING TO SOME OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS AND ARE COOPERATING WITH THOSE INQUIRIES. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES

AND THE PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANIES ARE REVIEWING THEIR COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER OPERATIONS THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY THESE REGULATORY

INVESTIGATIONS, AND THE LEGAL PRECEDENTS AND NEW INDUSTRY-WIDE LEGISLATION,

RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY ARISE FROM THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

59

AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, THERE IS PERIODIC INTEREST IN ENACTING NEW

REGULATIONS RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING

TAXATION OF ANNUITIES AND LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES, AS

WELL AS THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF GENDER, WITH RESPECT TO

TERMS, CONDITIONS, RATES OR BENEFITS OF AN INSURANCE POLICY. NEW FEDERAL

REGULATION IN ANY OF THESE AREAS COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT UPON

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES. ALSO, RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AIMED AT THE

PROMOTION OF TAX-ADVANTAGED SAVINGS THROUGH LIFETIME SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND

RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT IDS LIFE COMPANIES' SALES OF

ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS IF ENACTED.

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK

OUR AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK OPERATING SEGMENT ("AEB") OFFERS PRODUCTS THAT

MEET THE FINANCIAL SERVICE NEEDS OF THREE PRIMARY CLIENT GROUPS: RETAIL

CUSTOMERS, WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AEB'S OPERATIONS ARE

CONDUCTED PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR INDIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN

EXPRESS BANK LTD., AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AEB DOES NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY DO

BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES EXCEPT AS MAY BE INCIDENTAL TO ITS ACTIVITIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATING TO AEB

GENERALLY DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN U.S.- AND NON-U.S.-BASED ACTIVITIES.

AEB'S THREE PRIMARY BUSINESS LINES ARE CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES

("CFS"), THE PRIVATE BANK AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GROUP ("FIG"). CFS

PROVIDES CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC FINANCIAL NEEDS OF

RETAIL CUSTOMERS AND INCLUDES INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS, UNSECURED LINES OF

CREDIT, INSTALLMENT LOANS, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, MORTGAGE LOANS, AUTO LOANS AND

MUTUAL FUNDS. THE PRIVATE BANK FOCUSES ON HIGH NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS BY

PROVIDING THEM WITH INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, TRUST AND ESTATE PLANNING AND BANKING

SERVICES, INCLUDING SECURED LENDING. FIG PROVIDES FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS

INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION OF AEB OFFSHORE MUTUAL FUNDS. AEB ALSO

PROVIDES TREASURY AND CAPITAL MARKET PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING FOREIGN EXCHANGE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTIONS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES AND

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS.

WITH THE EXIT OF ITS CORPORATE BANKING BUSINESS VIRTUALLY COMPLETED DURING

2004, AEB CONTINUED ITS STRATEGY OF GROWING ITS CONSUMER AND FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS BUSINESSES. CORPORATE CLIENTS NOW REPRESENT ONLY 1% OF AEB'S TOTAL

LOAN PORTFOLIO. THESE CHANGES ALIGN AEB'S BUSINESSES MORE CLOSELY WITH THOSE OF

OUR OTHER BUSINESS UNITS AND POSITIONS IT TO PLAY A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE

DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES ON A GLOBAL BASIS. THIS CHANGE IN STRATEGY IS

REFLECTED IN THE FOLLOWING LOAN INFORMATION: AEB REDUCED ITS CORPORATE BANKING

LOANS BY $97 MILLION TO $76 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, INCREASED ITS CONSUMER

AND PRIVATE BANKING LOANS BY $377 MILLION, AND INCREASED ITS FIG LOANS BY $121

MILLION. LOANS OUTSTANDING WORLDWIDE WERE $6.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND

$6.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. DURING 2004, THE PRIVATE BANK CLIENT HOLDINGS

ROSE 15% TO A TOTAL OF $18.6 BILLION, CLIENT HOLDINGS IN CFS DECREASED 4% AND

FIG-RELATED NON-CREDIT FEE REVENUE INCREASED BY 28%.

AEB'S FUND PRODUCTS ARE SOLD BY THE PRIVATE BANK AND CFS BUSINESS LINES TO

INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS AND BY FIG THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS IN SEVERAL FOREIGN MARKETS.

AEB CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS NUMBER OF THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS IN EUROPE AND

ASIA. DURING 2004, AEB SIGNED APPROXIMATELY 60 DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS IN EUROPE

AND ASIA FOR THE SALE OF ITS OWN AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING A

STRATEGIC ALLIANCE IN TAIWAN WITH SHANGHAI COMMERCIAL & SAVINGS BANK LTD. TO

DISTRIBUTE PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS OF AEB, AEFA AND AEFA'S THREADNEEDLE

SUBSIDIARY. AEB'S ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN ITS FUND PRODUCTS AND RELATED

MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND ADMINISTERED ASSETS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $5.7 BILLION AT

YEAR-END (AS COMPARED WITH $5.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003).

61

IN 2004 AEB ADDED A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS AND SHARE CLASSES TO

ITS EXISTING LUXEMBOURG INVESTMENT COMPANY UMBRELLA FUND. IN ADDITION, AEB

TRANSFERRED ITS FUND OF FUNDS PORTFOLIOS FROM A CAYMAN-DOMICILED HEDGE FUND

STRUCTURE TO AMERICAN EXPRESS ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUND (LUX), A NEWLY

ESTABLISHED LUXEMBOURG FUND OF FUNDS. BY PUBLICLY REGISTERING ITS SHARES IN

LUXEMBOURG, THE FUND WILL BE ALLOWED TO SEEK PUBLIC REGISTRATION OF ITS SHARES

IN A VARIETY OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND THEREBY ENHANCE AEB'S DISTRIBUTION

ACTIVITIES. AEB ALSO INTRODUCED NEW INVESTMENT OPTIONS, WHICH COMBINE STANDARD

MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS AND CASH PRODUCTS WITHIN ITS DISCRETIONARY ASSET

MANAGEMENT WRAP STRUCTURE AND INCREASED THE NUMBER OF THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS

AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS OF AEFA (WHICH INCLUDES

THREADNEEDLE) PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO MANY OF AEB'S

LUXEMBOURG UMBRELLA FUND PORTFOLIOS.

AEB ALSO CONTINUED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHER PARTS OF AMERICAN EXPRESS TO

CROSS-SELL A RANGE OF PAYMENT, LENDING, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SERVICE PRODUCTS

AND BUILD DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFLUENT AND PRE-AFFLUENT CONSUMER AND SMALL

BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. AEB MARKETS PRIVATE BANK

SERVICES TO A HIGHLY SELECTIVE GROUP OF CARDMEMBERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

AEB OFFERS CREDIT PRODUCTS SUCH AS INSTALLMENT LOANS AND REVOLVING LINES OF

CREDIT TO BOTH CARDMEMBERS AND NON-CARDMEMBERS IN GERMANY, GREECE, UNITED

KINGDOM, HONG KONG, INDIA, SINGAPORE AND TAIWAN. AEB ALSO MARKETS A WIDE RANGE

OF INVESTMENT AND SAVINGS PRODUCTS TO CARDMEMBERS AND SELECT NON-CARDMEMBERS IN

GERMANY, GREECE, HONG KONG, INDIA, INDONESIA, SINGAPORE, TAIWAN AND PHILIPPINES.

AEB HAS ALSO CONTRACTED WITH AECC TO MARKET AECC'S INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES, AND

SEPARATELY OPERATES A JOINT VENTURE (AMERICAN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL DEPOSIT

COMPANY) WITH AEFC IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS THAT ISSUES DEPOSIT CERTIFICATES

DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, EUROS, POUNDS STERLING AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS.

AEB HAS A GLOBAL NETWORK WITH OFFICES IN 45 COUNTRIES. ITS WORLDWIDE

HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY. IT MAINTAINS AN INTERNATIONAL BANKING

AGENCY IN NEW YORK CITY AND FACILITY OFFICES IN SAN FRANCISCO, SAN DIEGO AND LOS

ANGELES, CALIFORNIA. ITS WHOLLY OWNED EDGE ACT SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK

INTERNATIONAL ("AEBI"), IS HEADQUARTERED IN MIAMI, FLORIDA, AND HAS BRANCHES IN

NEW YORK CITY AND MIAMI.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, AEB ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL CERTAIN OF ITS

OPERATIONS IN LUXEMBOURG. THE SALE WAS COMPLETED IN JANUARY 2005. IN ADDITION,

IN DECEMBER 2004, AEB MADE THE DECISION TO SELL CERTAIN OF ITS OPERATIONS IN

BANGLADESH, EGYPT AND PAKISTAN.

AEB'S BUSINESS DOES NOT, AS A WHOLE, EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATIONS.

SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING AEB

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES,

AEB PROVIDES BANKING SERVICES TO THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AEB IS ONLY

ONE OF MANY INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL BANKS USED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ITS OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES. AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONSTITUTE ONLY A FEW OF

AEB'S MANY CUSTOMERS.

62

AEB'S TOTAL ASSETS WERE $13.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND $14.2

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. LIQUID ASSETS, CONSISTING OF CASH AND DEPOSITS

WITH BANKS, TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS, WERE $4.7 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND $5.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT INFORMATION ABOUT AEB'S IMPAIRED (OR

NON-PERFORMING) LOANS. AEB DEFINES AN IMPAIRED LOAN AS ANY LOAN (OTHER THAN

CERTAIN SMALLER-BALANCE CONSUMER LOANS) ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS

DISCONTINUED BECAUSE THE CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST HAS BECOME

90 DAYS PAST DUE OR IF, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, THE BORROWER IS UNLIKELY TO

MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. FOR SMALLER-BALANCE CONSUMER LOANS, MANAGEMENT

ESTABLISHES RESERVES IT BELIEVES TO BE ADEQUATE TO ABSORB CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT

IN THE PORTFOLIO. GENERALLY, THESE LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF IN FULL WHEN AN

IMPAIRMENT IS DETERMINED (E.G., BORROWER'S PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY) OR WHEN THE LOAN

BECOMES 120 OR 180 DAYS PAST DUE, DEPENDING ON LOAN TYPE.

AEB RECOGNIZES INTEREST INCOME ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. WHEN AEB'S MANAGEMENT

PLACES LOANS ON NON-PERFORMING STATUS, IT REVERSES ALL PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED BUT

UNPAID INTEREST AGAINST CURRENT INTEREST INCOME. AEB RECOGNIZES CASH RECEIPTS OF

INTEREST ON NON-PERFORMING LOANS EITHER AS INTEREST INCOME OR AS A REDUCTION OF

PRINCIPAL, BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT AS TO THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF

PRINCIPAL. GENERALLY, A NON-PERFORMING LOAN MAY BE RETURNED TO PERFORMING STATUS

WHEN ALL CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS DUE ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF REPAYMENT WITHIN A

REASONABLE PERIOD AND THE BORROWER SHOWS SUSTAINED REPAYMENT PERFORMANCE, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN OR WHEN THE LOAN HAS BECOME

WELL SECURED AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.

INTEREST-EARNING ADVANCES UNDER LINES OF CREDIT AND OTHER SIMILAR CONSUMER

LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE RESERVE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UPON REACHING

SPECIFIED CONTRACTUAL DELINQUENCY STAGES, OR EARLIER IN THE EVENT OF THE

BORROWER'S PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY OR IF THE LOAN IS OTHERWISE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE.

INTEREST INCOME ON THESE LOANS GENERALLY ACCRUES UNTIL THE LOAN IS WRITTEN OFF.

AEB SEPARATELY MAINTAINS AND PROVIDES FOR RESERVES RELATING TO CREDIT

LOSSES FOR LOANS, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER CREDIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE RESERVE

IS ESTABLISHED BY CHARGING A PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AGAINST INCOME. THE

AMOUNT CHARGED TO INCOME IS BASED UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL

CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN RELATION TO OUTSTANDING CREDITS, A CONTINUOUS

ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF EACH CREDIT AND MANAGEMENT EVALUATION OF

EXPOSURES IN EACH APPLICABLE COUNTRY AS RELATED TO CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY OF

THE RESERVE IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE, AS SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED.

AMOUNTS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE ARE CHARGED AGAINST THE RESERVE AND SUBSEQUENT

RECOVERIES, IF ANY, ARE CREDITED TO THE RESERVE.

THE RESERVE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO LOANS IS REPORTED AS A REDUCTION

OF LOANS. THE RESERVE RELATED TO DERIVATIVES IS REPORTED AS A REDUCTION OF

TRADING ASSETS, AND THE RESERVE RELATED TO OTHER CREDIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS

REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES.

RISKS

THE GLOBAL NATURE OF AEB'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IS SUCH THAT CONCENTRATIONS

OF CREDIT TO GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS ARE NOT UNUSUAL. AEB CONTINUALLY MONITORS AND

ACTIVELY MANAGES ITS CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS TO REDUCE THE ASSOCIATED RISK. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004, AEB HAD SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN ON- AND

OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY REPRESENTED BY

DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES, LOANS, FORWARD CONTRACTS, CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS

OF LETTERS OF CREDIT (STANDBY AND COMMERCIAL) AND GUARANTEES. THE COUNTERPARTIES

TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WERE PRIMARILY UNRELATED TO AEB, AND PRINCIPALLY

CONSISTED OF CONSUMERS TO WHOM AEB HAS EXTENDED LOANS, BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OPERATING GEOGRAPHICALLY WITHIN THE

ASIA/PACIFIC REGION, EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA, LATIN AMERICA, THE INDIAN

SUBCONTINENT AND MIDDLE EAST/AFRICA.

AEB'S EARNINGS ARE SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE

MATURITY OF LIABILITIES DOES NOT, GENERALLY, MATCH THE MATURITY OF ASSETS. AEB

INVESTS EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN HIGH GRADE FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND

MAINTAINS MANDATORY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS IN A NUMBER

69

OF COUNTRIES AS REQUIRED BY CENTRAL BANKS. AEB MONITORS AND CONTROLS INTEREST

RATE RISK THROUGH A RIGOROUS EARNINGS AT RISK PROCESS BOTH ON A COUNTRY AND

GLOBAL LEVEL. AEB MANAGES THE DURATION/MATURITY MISMATCH OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES THROUGH ADJUSTING THE DURATION/MATURITY OF ASSETS AND/OR BY USING

DERIVATIVES. ON OCCASION, AEB MAY DECIDE TO MISMATCH IN ANTICIPATION OF A CHANGE

IN FUTURE INTEREST RATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDELINES. AEB SELLS FOREIGN

EXCHANGE PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND MAY DECIDE TO TAKE PROPRIETARY

TRADING POSITIONS AS A RESULT OF THIS BUSINESS. THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK IS

MANAGED AT THE BRANCH AND GLOBAL LEVEL THROUGH A RIGOROUS VALUE AT RISK PROCESS.

AEB MANAGES COUNTERPARTY CREDIT EXPOSURE ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE

DERIVATIVES THROUGH A DYNAMIC MARK-TO-MARKET AND POTENTIAL FUTURE EXPOSURE

PROCESS, IN WHICH THE CURRENT POSITIVE FAIR VALUE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE EXPOSURE

ARE CALCULATED AND MANAGED AGAINST COUNTERPARTY LOAN EQUIVALENT LIMITS. YOU CAN

FIND MORE INFORMATION ON AEB'S MANAGEMENT OF ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON PAGES

43-44 AND PAGE 67 UNDER THE CAPTION "AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY RISK MANAGEMENT -

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS" IN OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH

PORTION OF SUCH REPORT IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

BECAUSE AEB CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS IN EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES AND

IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE LESS POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY STABLE THAN THE UNITED

STATES OR THOSE IN WESTERN EUROPE, ITS PRIVATE BANKING, CFS AND FIG ACTIVITIES

MAY BE SUBJECT TO GREATER CREDIT AND COMPLIANCE RISKS THAN ARE FOUND IN MORE

WELL-DEVELOPED JURISDICTIONS. AEB CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURES IN SUCH

JURISDICTIONS, AND REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS CLIENT BASE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL

LEGAL RISKS AS A RESULT OF CLIENTS' USE OF AEB'S BANKING SERVICES.

YOU CAN FIND A DISCUSSION OF AEB'S USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, ON PAGES 43-44 AND PAGE 67 UNDER THE CAPTION "AMERICAN EXPRESS

COMPANY RISK MANAGEMENT - MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS," AND IN NOTE 9 ON

PAGES 104-105 OF OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS OF SUCH

REPORT ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

COMPETITION - BANKING SERVICES

THE BANKING SERVICES OF AEB ARE SUBJECT TO VIGOROUS COMPETITION EVERYWHERE

AEB OPERATES. COMPETITORS INCLUDE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL BANKS WHOSE ASSETS

OFTEN EXCEED THOSE OF AEB, OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING CERTAIN OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES OF OURS) AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.

REGULATION - BANKING SERVICES

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANKING CORP. ("AEBC") IS A NEW YORK INVESTMENT COMPANY

ORGANIZED UNDER ARTICLE XII OF THE NEW YORK BANKING LAW AND IS A WHOLLY OWNED

DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF AMERICAN EXPRESS. AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. ("AEBL") IS A

WHOLLY OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF AEBC. AEBC, AEBL AND AEBL'S GLOBAL NETWORK OF

OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO CONTINUOUS SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION

BY THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT ("NYSBD") PURSUANT TO THE NEW YORK

BANKING LAW. AEBC DOES NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN BANKING ACTIVITIES.

AEBL'S BRANCHES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE LICENSED AND

REGULATED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE

SAME LOCAL REQUIREMENTS AS

70

OTHER COMPETITORS THAT HAVE THE SAME LICENSE. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, AEBL'S

NEW YORK AGENCY IS SUPERVISED AND REGULARLY EXAMINED BY THE NYSBD. IN ADDITION,

THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE "FEDERAL RESERVE

BOARD") REGULATES, SUPERVISES AND EXAMINES AEBI AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISES AND EXAMINES AEBL'S SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES

AND SAN DIEGO FACILITY OFFICES.

SINCE AEBC AND AEBL DO NOT DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, EXCEPT AS MAY

BE INCIDENTAL TO THEIR ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, OUR AFFILIATION

WITH AEBC AND AEBL NEITHER CAUSES US TO BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BANK

HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED, NOR REQUIRES US TO REGISTER AS A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD'S REGULATION Y. AEBC AND AEBL

ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION BY

THE FDIC, AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE

COMPETITIVE EQUALITY BANKING ACT OF 1987 OTHER THAN ANTI-TIE-IN RULES WITH

RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF CERTAIN OF ITS

AFFILIATES. AEBC AND AEBL ARE NOT FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE

GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT.

THE NYSBD REQUIRES AEBC, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, TO MONITOR ITS FINANCIAL

CONDITION IN REFERENCE TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD'S RISK-BASED CAPITAL

GUIDELINES AND COMPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE CONSTRAINTS APPLICABLE TO STATE-CHARTERED

BANKS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. PURSUANT TO THE FDIC

IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991, THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD, AMONG OTHER FEDERAL BANKING

AGENCIES, ADOPTED REGULATIONS DEFINING LEVELS OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY. UNDER THESE

REGULATIONS, A BANK IS DEEMED TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED IF IT MAINTAINS A TIER 1

RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%, A TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT

LEAST 10%, AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%. BASED ON AEBC'S TIER 1

RISK-BASED CAPITAL, TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS, AEBC IS

CONSIDERED TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

IN RECENT YEARS, U.S. AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, TOGETHER WITH

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE RAISED INCREASING CONCERNS OVER THE ABILITY OF

CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CORRUPT PERSONS TO USE GLOBAL FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES TO FACILITATE MONEY LAUNDERING. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO THE USA PATRIOT ACT

OF 2001 (THE "PATRIOT ACT") THAT SPECIFICALLY IMPACT CERTAIN MONEY LAUNDERING

PREVENTION ACTIVITIES OF ENTITIES INVOLVED, AS AEBL IS, IN CORRESPONDENT AND

PRIVATE BANKING ACTIVITIES. COMPLIANCE EFFORTS TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING REMAIN

A HIGH PRIORITY FOR AEBL AND IT MAY INCREASE THESE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS FURTHER

REGULATIONS EXPECTED UNDER THE PATRIOT ACT AS WELL AS OTHER EVOLVING SUPERVISORY

STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH AEBL DOES BUSINESS.

IN APRIL 2003, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE "BASEL

COMMITTEE") ISSUED A FINAL CONSULTATIVE PAPER ON THE PROPOSED NEW BASEL CAPITAL

ACCORD ("NEW ACCORD"). THE NEW ACCORD PROPOSES RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES

THAT WILL REPLACE THE PREVIOUS GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE 1988.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF CENTRAL BANKS AND BANK

SUPERVISORS FROM THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND DEVELOPS BROAD

SUPERVISORY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION OF

BANKING INSTITUTIONS. THE NEW ACCORD SETS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATIONAL

RISK AND REFINES THE EXISTING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT AND MARKET RISK

EXPOSURES. ON MAY 11, 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED IT ACHIEVED CONSENSUS

ON THE NEW ACCORD AND PUBLISHED THE TEXT OF THE

71

FRAMEWORK ON JUNE 26, 2004. DESPITE THE RELEASE OF THE FRAMEWORK, IT IS NOT

CLEAR AT THIS TIME WHETHER AND IN WHAT MANNER THE NEW ACCORD WILL BE ADOPTED BY

BANK REGULATORS WITH RESPECT TO BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY SUPERVISE AND

REGULATE. AEBC WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR REGULATORY ACTION ON THIS MATTER AND

ASSESS ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT. AEBC BELIEVES THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW

ACCORD, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE TO AEBC, COULD INCREASE MINIMUM RISK-BASED

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND RESULT IN CHANGES TO CERTAIN OF AEBC'S INFORMATION

SYSTEMS, PROCESSES AND EMPLOYEE TRAINING.

72

CORPORATE AND OTHER

BRAND

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES -- TRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY, QUALITY AND

CUSTOMER SERVICE -- ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE

BRAND BY EDUCATING EMPLOYEES ABOUT THESE ATTRIBUTES AND BY INCORPORATING THEM

INTO OUR PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

TECHNOLOGY

WE HAVE DEVOTED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO OUR GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS

AND HAVE UNDERTAKEN SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO PROTECT AND MANAGE OUR PROPRIETARY

SYSTEMS AND THE DATA COLLECTED AND STORED ON OUR SYSTEMS. IN THIS VEIN, WE HAVE

CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON WAYS TO SECURE OUR SYSTEMS FROM "HACKERS" AND OTHER

UNAUTHORIZED USERS.

IN 2002, WE OUTSOURCED MOST OF OUR TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS WORK TO IBM. THIS

ARRANGEMENT, WHICH HAS A SEVEN-YEAR TERM WITH OPTIONS TO EXTEND, ENABLES US TO

BENEFIT FROM IBM'S EXPERTISE WHILE LOWERING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS.

IBM HAS TAKEN ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANAGING MOST OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY TECHNOLOGY

OPERATIONS FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING MAINFRAME, MIDRANGE AND DESKTOP SYSTEMS; WEB

HOSTING; DATABASE ADMINISTRATION; HELP DESK SERVICES AND DATA CENTER OPERATIONS.

OUR INTERNAL IT ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO RETAIN THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY

COMPETENCIES, INCLUDING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY, MANAGING STRATEGIC

RELATIONSHIPS WITH TECHNOLOGIES' PARTNERS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING

APPLICATIONS AND DATABASES AND MANAGING THE TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIOS OF OUR

BUSINESSES.

REGULATION - GENERAL

MOST ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS REGULATION BY U.S.

FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND BY NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR REGULATORY BODIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES. CERTAIN OF

OUR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND RELATED REGULATIONS

AND RULES OF THE SEC AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. NEW LAWS OR

REGULATIONS OR CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN

INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT) COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TO THE

EXTENT THAT DIFFERENT REGULATORY SYSTEMS IMPOSE OVERLAPPING OR INCONSISTENT

REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE FACE COMPLEXITY AND ADDITIONAL

COSTS IN OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AND TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED SERVICES. REGULATORY ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES TO GROW WORLDWIDE AND IS GENERALLY BEING

DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT THE RAPID AND

WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION AND USE OF INFORMATION.

THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT ("GLBA") BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2001. GLBA

PROVIDES FOR DISCLOSURE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION'S PRIVACY POLICIES AND

PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO "OPT OUT" OF THE INSTITUTION'S

DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL

73

INFORMATION TO UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS). THIS

LEGISLATION DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS THAT AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

TO CONSUMERS, AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE ADOPTED SUCH LEGISLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN

2003 CALIFORNIA ENACTED THAT STATE'S FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT. WE WILL

CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH

APPLICABLE LAW AND OUR INTERNAL DATA PROTECTION POLICIES, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS

TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT, WHILE SEEKING TO COLLECT AND USE

DATA TO PROPERLY ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.

THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT OF 1970 ("FCRA") REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER

CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER COMPANIES. PROVISIONS OF FCRA THAT

PREEMPT STATES FROM ENACTING LEGISLATION REGARDING THE SHARING OF CUSTOMER

INFORMATION AMONG AFFILIATES AND CERTAIN OTHER USES OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT

INFORMATION WERE SET TO EXPIRE ON JANUARY 1, 2004. THE JANUARY 1, 2004

EXPIRATION DATE OF THESE PROVISIONS WAS REMOVED BY THE ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER

2003 OF THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT ("FACT ACT"). THE FACT ACT

SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDS THE FCRA TO MAKE THE EXCHANGE OF CONSUMER INFORMATION AMONG

AFFILIATES, TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER ACTIVITIES INVOLVING CONSUMER CREDIT

REPORT INFORMATION, SUBJECT TO ONLY FEDERAL LAW. (THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL

INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT ("SB1") BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2004. SB1 REQUIRES,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EITHER STOP SHARING PERSONAL

FINANCIAL INFORMATION AMONG AFFILIATES THAT ARE NOT IN THE SAME LINE OF

BUSINESS, OR PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF THE DISCLOSURE

OF THE INFORMATION TO THE AFFILIATE. PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE, THE AMERICAN

BANKERS ASSOCIATION FILED A LAWSUIT IN AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT CERTAIN PROVISIONS

OF SB1 FROM TAKING EFFECT. ON JUNE 30, 2004, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ISSUED A DECISION HOLDING THAT SB1 WAS NOT

PREEMPTED BY THE FCRA. THE DECISION HAS BEEN APPEALED TO THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT, AND A DECISION ON THE APPEAL IS EXPECTED TO BE

ISSUED DURING 2005.) AT THE SAME TIME, THE FACT ACT REQUIRES ANY COMPANY THAT

RECEIVES INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN AFFILIATE TO PERMIT THE

CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM HAVING THAT INFORMATION USED TO MARKET THE COMPANY'S

PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER.

THE FACT ACT FURTHER AMENDS THE FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW PROVISIONS

DESIGNED TO PREVENT OR DECREASE IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF

CONSUMER CREDIT INFORMATION. NEW DUTIES ARE IMPOSED ON BOTH CONSUMER REPORTING

AGENCIES AND ON BUSINESSES THAT FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CONSUMER

CREDIT REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FURNISHER OF INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT

PROCEDURES TO PREVENT THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE

RESULT OF IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO, IF A CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY OF

INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, THE FURNISHER OF THAT

INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A

TIMELY FASHION. THE FACT ACT ALSO REQUIRES GRANTORS OF CREDIT THAT USE CONSUMER

CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO OFFER A BORROWER CREDIT

ON TERMS THAT ARE "MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE" THAN THE TERMS OFFERED TO MOST OF

THE LENDER'S OTHER CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE BORROWER THAT THE TERMS ARE BASED ON

A CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. IN SUCH A CASE THE BORROWER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A

FREE COPY OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. BEGINNING AUGUST 1,

2005, GRANTORS OF CREDIT USING PRE-SCREENED CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION

IN CREDIT SOLICITATIONS MUST INCLUDE AN ENHANCED NOTICE TO CONSUMERS THAT THEY

HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT FROM RECEIVING FURTHER PRE-SCREENED OFFERS OF CREDIT.

THE EFFECTIVE DATES AND IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS FOR MANY OF THE OTHER

PROVISIONS OF THE FACT ACT ARE EXPECTED TO BE

74

ISSUED BY VARIOUS FEDERAL REGULATORY AGENCIES DURING 2005. THE COMPANY IS

CONTINUING TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF THE FACT ACT AND THE IMPLEMENTING

REGULATIONS ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE

PERSONALIZED SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 WAS ENACTED IN OCTOBER 2001

IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11TH TERRORIST ATTACKS. THE PATRIOT ACT

SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENED EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION AND THE

EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THE PATRIOT ACT CONTAINS A

WIDE VARIETY OF PROVISIONS AIMED AT FIGHTING TERRORISM, INCLUDING PROVISIONS

AIMED AT IMPEDING TERRORISTS' ABILITY TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN SUPPORT

OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PATRIOT ACT REQUIRES FEDERAL

REGULATORS, LED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, TO REGULATE OR TAKE OTHER

STEPS TO REQUIRE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED

INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS. WHILE AMERICAN EXPRESS

HAS LONG MAINTAINED ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS IN OUR BUSINESSES, THE

SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS UNDER THE PATRIOT ACT

APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED WITHIN AEB, TRS, AEFA

AND THEIR AFFILIATES, PRESCRIBING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SUCH ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING PROGRAMS, AND WE HAVE ENHANCED EXISTING PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPED AND

IMPLEMENTED NEW ONES IN RESPONSE TO THESE NEW REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN APRIL

2002, THE U.S. TREASURY ISSUED DRAFT REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OPERATORS OF

CREDIT CARD NETWORKS (SUCH AS VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB, DISCOVER AND

AMERICAN EXPRESS) THAT WOULD REQUIRE CREDIT CARD NETWORKS TO HAVE RISK-BASED

PROGRAMS TO SCREEN INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE CARDS OR ACQUIRE

MERCHANTS ON THEIR NETWORKS. AS A RESULT, WE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM

FOR OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS, AND IN 2004 COMPLETED OUR SCREENING OF

EXISTING LICENSED INSTITUTIONS AND WILL APPLY THE SCREENING UNDER THIS PROGRAM

TO ALL NEW LICENSING RELATIONSHIPS. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A

CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM APPLICABLE TO MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, AND HAVE

ENHANCED OUR KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER AND ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAMS IN OTHERS.

WE INTEND TO TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE

ADOPTED. IN ADDITION, WE WILL TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

INITIATIVES ADOPTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING A NUMBER

OF REGULATED BUSINESSES. WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EU LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS

IN THE OTHER MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO

COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING EUROPEAN UNION

DIRECTIVES APPLICABLE TO CREDIT INSTITUTIONS, INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. SIGNIFICANT EU DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE THE EU INSURANCE

MEDIATION DIRECTIVE PURSUANT TO WHICH EACH EU MEMBER STATE WAS REQUIRED TO

AUTHORIZE GENERAL INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES IN ITS STATE BY MID-JANUARY 2005.

SUBJECT TO THIS AUTHORIZATION, INTERMEDIARIES WILL THEN BE PERMITTED TO CONDUCT

INSURANCE INTERMEDIATION IN OTHER MEMBER STATES VIA THE EU "PASSPORTING" REGIME.

IN ADDITION, THE EU DIRECTIVE ON THE SUPPLEMENTARY SUPERVISION OF FINANCIAL

CONGLOMERATES CONTEMPLATES THAT CERTAIN FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATES INVOLVED IN

BANKING, INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES WILL BE SUBJECT TO A SYSTEM OF

SUPPLEMENTARY SUPERVISION AT THE LEVEL OF THE HOLDING COMPANY CONSTITUTING THE

FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATE. THE DIRECTIVE REQUIRES SUCH FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATES TO,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPLEMENT MEASURES TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE LEVERAGE AND

MULTIPLE GEARING OF CAPITAL, AND TO MAINTAIN INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESSES TO

ADDRESS RISK CONCENTRATIONS AS WELL AS RISKS ARISING FROM SIGNIFICANT INTRAGROUP

75

TRANSACTIONS. WE ARE EVALUATING THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS DIRECTIVE TO OUR

BUSINESS IN LIGHT OF THE PROPOSED SPIN-OFF OF AEFC.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM THE USE OF OUR CARD

PRODUCTS, TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN

COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR

REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENT, WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON PAGES 117-120 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS AND WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.) OUR REVENUES CAN BE

AFFECTED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE

AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF

OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS' SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY, FOR

THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN OTHER THAN THEIR

LOCAL CURRENCY, AND FOR THE REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE

SALES). SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS' CURRENCY CAN

ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF THE CARD IN

CONNECTION WITH SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY. THE MAJORITY OF AEB'S

REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM BUSINESS CONDUCTED IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES. SOME OF THE RISKS ATTENDANT TO THOSE OPERATIONS INCLUDE CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS IN EACH

SUCH COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE POSSIBILITY

THAT, BECAUSE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR MAY BE REALIZED IN

AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESS THAN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY ARE

CURRENTLY RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF

TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE PURCHASE BY CARDMEMBERS OF

GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE

BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A TRAVELERS CHEQUE DENOMINATED IN A SECOND

CURRENCY; FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS HELD BY AEB AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ITS

CLIENT-RELATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING OPERATIONS; AND, IN MOST INSTANCES,

INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS, UNLESS PROPERLY MONITORED AND

MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

OUR POLICY IN THIS AREA IS GENERALLY TO MONITOR CLOSELY ALL FOREIGN

EXCHANGE POSITIONS AND TO MINIMIZE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES, FOR

EXAMPLE, BY OFFSETTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY

LIABILITIES, AS IN THE CASE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE

FINANCED IN THE SAME CURRENCY. AN ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUE THAT WE MAY USE TO MANAGE

EXPOSURES IS THE SPOT AND FORWARD PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AS A

HEDGE OF NET EXPOSURES IN THOSE CURRENCIES. ADDITIONALLY, CARDMEMBERS MAY BE

CHARGED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS FOR THEIR SPENDING OUTSIDE THEIR LOCAL COUNTRY.

OUR INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE HEDGED BY FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

OR BY IDENTIFIABLE TRANSACTIONS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

IMPORTANT FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY ALSO BE MADE IN OUR OTHER REPORTS FILED WITH THE

SEC, IN OUR PRESS RELEASES AND IN

76

OTHER DOCUMENTS. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE, THROUGH OUR MANAGEMENT, MAY

MAKE ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED BELOW, WHICH COULD CAUSE

ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM SUCH STATEMENTS. THE WORDS "BELIEVE,"

"EXPECT," "ANTICIPATE," "OPTIMISTIC," "INTEND," "PLAN," "AIM," "WILL," "MAY,"

"SHOULD," "COULD," "WOULD," "LIKELY" AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO

IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. READERS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE

RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON

WHICH THEY ARE MADE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE PUBLICLY OR REVISE ANY

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,

THE FOLLOWING.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY'S ABILITY TO.

-     COMPLETE OUR PLAN TO SPIN-OFF THE AEFA BUSINESS UNIT TO OUR

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO FINAL APPROVAL BY OUR BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, THE RECEIPT OF NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS AND A

PORTFOLIO AND, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT READILY

MARKETABLE, INCLUDING THE VALUATION OF THE INTEREST-ONLY (I/O)

STRIP RELATING TO TRS' LENDING SECURITIZATIONS; AND

-     ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN ALL OUR BUSINESSES.

78

TRS' ABILITY TO.

-     INCREASE CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR TRAVEL

RELATED SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND

TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS AND GROWTH IN CARD

LENDING BALANCES, WHICH DEPEND IN PART ON THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND

ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND INCREASE

REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS, ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE

CARDMEMBER ATTRITION, INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE, AND CAPTURE A

GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS' TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON OUR

NETWORK BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS;

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE IN A 51-STORY, 2.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT

BUILDING LOCATED IN LOWER MANHATTAN, WHICH ALSO SERVES AS THE HEADQUARTERS FOR

TRS AND AEB. THIS BUILDING, WHICH IS ON LAND LEASED FROM THE BATTERY PARK CITY

AUTHORITY FOR A TERM EXPIRING IN 2069, IS ONE OF FOUR OFFICE BUILDINGS IN A

COMPLEX KNOWN AS THE WORLD FINANCIAL CENTER. WE HAVE A 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

THE BUILDING. IN 2002, AN AFFILIATE OF BROOKFIELD FINANCIAL PROPERTIES ACQUIRED

THE 51% INTEREST IN THE BUILDING THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN OWNED BY LEHMAN

BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.

BECAUSE OF ITS PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE

DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. AS A RESULT

OF THESE EVENTS, WE WERE REQUIRED TO TEMPORARILY RELOCATE OUR HEADQUARTERS AND

WE ENTERED INTO FIVE NEW LEASES FOR APPROXIMATELY 750,000 SQUARE FEET OF SPACE

IN THE NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY AND CONNECTICUT AREA. THE REPAIR WORK TO OUR

HEADQUARTERS WAS COMPLETED ON SCHEDULE DURING 2002 AND WE RELOCATED BACK INTO

THE COMPANY HEADQUARTERS. WE HAVE SUBLEASED A PORTION OF THE TEMPORARY SPACE,

AND WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SUBLEASE OUT THE REMAINING ADDITIONAL SPACE IN

THE TRI-STATE AREA. WE ALSO RELOCATED BACK TO THE WORLD FINANCIAL CENTER

EMPLOYEES FROM OUR JERSEY CITY FACILITY WHO HAD BEEN PERMANENTLY BASED AT SUCH

LOCATION BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. WE HAVE SUBLEASED THE JERSEY CITY SPACE TO A

THIRD PARTY.

OTHER PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS OF TRS INCLUDE: THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE

CENTERS IN FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA; PHOENIX, ARIZONA; GREENSBORO, NORTH

CAROLINA; SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH; AND THE AMEX CANADA INC. HEADQUARTERS IN

MARKHAM, ONTARIO, CANADA.

AEFA OPERATES ITS BUSINESS FROM TWO PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

LOCATED IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA: THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL CENTER, WHICH

WE LEASE, AND THE CLIENT SERVICE CENTER, WHICH WE OWN. TITLE TO A THIRD

PROPERTY, THE OPERATIONS CENTER, WHICH HAD BEEN OWNED BY AEFA, WAS TRANSFERRED

TO TRS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 TO BETTER REFLECT THE OPERATIONS BEING

PERFORMED IN THE FACILITY. AEFA'S LEASE TERM FOR THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL

CENTER, WHICH BEGAN IN NOVEMBER 2000, IS FOR 20 YEARS WITH SEVERAL OPTIONS TO

EXTEND THE TERM. AEFA ALSO OWNS OAK RIDGE CONFERENCE CENTER, A TRAINING FACILITY

AND CONFERENCE CENTER IN CHASKA, MINNESOTA.

IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY, A SUBSIDIARY OF AEFA, HAS ITS CORPORATE

HEADQUARTERS IN ASHWAUBENON, WISCONSIN, A SUBURB OF GREEN BAY.

84

IN DECEMBER 2004, SEVERAL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO

SELL AND LEASE BACK A TOTAL OF SEVEN REAL PROPERTIES LOCATED IN THE UNITED

STATES TO DESIGNATED AFFILIATES OF THE INLAND REAL ESTATE GROUP, INC. ("INLAND")

AND CLOSED ON THE SALE OF SIX OF THOSE PROPERTIES. THE SIX PROPERTIES THAT WERE

SOLD IN DECEMBER 2004 WERE THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE CENTERS IN FORT

LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA; GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA; AND PHOENIX, ARIZONA; THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS DATA CENTER IN MINNEAPOLIS; THE IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE

CORPORATION HEADQUARTERS IN ASHWAUBENON, WISCONSIN; AND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

FINANCE CENTER IN PHOENIX. THE REMAINING PROPERTY TO BE SOLD UNDER THIS

AGREEMENT IS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE CENTER IN SALT LAKE CITY AND THAT

TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN MARCH 2005, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING

CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, IN JANUARY 2005, ONE OF OUR CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES

CLOSED ON THE SALE AND LEASE BACK OF THE AMEX CANADA HEADQUARTERS PROPERTY

REFERRED TO ABOVE IN MARKHAM, ONTARIO, CANADA. THESE SALE AND LEASEBACK

TRANSACTIONS WILL ENABLE US TO MONETIZE THE VALUE OF THESE PROPERTIES AND USE

THE PROCEEDS FOR RE-INVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESSES.

AT EACH CLOSING, AN AFFILIATE OF INLAND LEASED THE RELEVANT PROPERTY BACK

TO ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES FOR A TEN-YEAR TERM, WITH AN OPTION GIVEN TO US TO

RENEW THE LEASE FOR UP TO SIX RENEWAL TERMS OF FIVE YEARS EACH. (THE SAME

PROCEDURE WILL APPLY TO THE REMAINING PROPERTY REFERENCED ABOVE.) THE LEASES ARE

NET LEASES WHEREBY EACH AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITY THAT LEASES BACK THE PROPERTY IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING

MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, UTILITIES, OPERATING EXPENSES AND INSURANCE COSTS) IN

ADDITION TO ANNUAL RENT. THE EIGHT PROPERTIES COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 2.6 MILLION

SQUARE FEET AND HAVE AN AGGREGATE NET BOOK VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $235 MILLION

AND AN AGGREGATE SALES PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $390 MILLION. THE AGGREGATE ANNUAL

RENT FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE LEASES FOR ALL THE EIGHT PROPERTIES WILL BE

APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION. THE SALE LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS WILL NOT MATERIALLY

IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY YEAR. GAINS RESULTING FROM COMPLETED SALE

AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE INITIAL TEN-YEAR LEASE

PERIODS. WE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER WHETHER SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE

APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER PROPERTIES THAT WE CURRENTLY OWN.

IN FEBRUARY 2000, WE ENTERED INTO A TEN-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH TRAMMELL CROW

CORPORATE SERVICES, INC. FOR FACILITIES, PROJECT AND TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT AND

OTHER RELATED SERVICES. THE AGREEMENT COVERS NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA AND PARTS

OF EUROPE.

GENERALLY, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES LEASE THE PREMISES WE OCCUPY IN OTHER

LOCATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FACILITIES WE OWN OR OCCUPY SUIT OUR NEEDS AND

ARE WELL MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND

ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN

CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WE BELIEVE

WE HAVE MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO EACH OF THESE ACTIONS AND WE INTEND TO DEFEND

THEM VIGOROUSLY. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE NOT A PARTY TO, NOR ARE ANY OF OUR

PROPERTIES THE SUBJECT OF, ANY PENDING LEGAL OR ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS THAT

WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF

ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

85

IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD AS THE

PROCEEDINGS ARE RESOLVED. CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE COMPANY ARE

DESCRIBED BELOW.

THAT, BY AGREEING TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS, MBNA AND CITIBANK

ISSUING AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ALSO

BELIEVES THAT THIS LAWSUIT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE SAME DEFENSES AVAILABLE TO THE

FOR THE BUSINESS LOST AS A RESULT OF THE ILLEGAL, ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES OF

THE CARD ASSOCIATIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY LOCKED THE COMPANY OUT OF THE BANK-ISSUED

CARD BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE LAWSUIT FOLLOWS THE U.S. SUPREME COURT'S

OCTOBER 2004 DECISION NOT TO HEAR AN APPEAL FROM VISA AND MASTERCARD THAT SOUGHT

TO OVERTURN A LOWER COURT RULING THAT FOUND THE TWO CARD ASSOCIATIONS IN

VIOLATION OF U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS.

AEFA HAD RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM THE STAFF OF THE NASD INDICATING THAT IT HAD

MADE A PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION TO RECOMMEND THAT THE NASD BRING AN ACTION

AGAINST AEFA FOR POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND THE RULES

AND REGULATIONS OF THE SEC AND THE NASD. THE NOTICE RECEIVED BY AEFA COMES IN

THE CONTEXT OF A BROADER INDUSTRY-WIDE REVIEW OF THE MUTUAL FUND AND BROKERAGE

INDUSTRIES THAT IS BEING CONDUCTED BY VARIOUS REGULATORS. THE NASD STAFF'S

ALLEGATIONS RELATE TO AEFA'S PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO VARIOUS REVENUE SHARING

ARRANGEMENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH AEFA RECEIVES PAYMENTS FROM CERTAIN

NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS FOR AGREEING TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS AVAILABLE

THROUGH AEFA'S NATIONAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. IN PARTICULAR, THE NASD HAS

ALLEGED THAT AEFA (I) FAILED TO PROPERLY DISCLOSE SUCH REVENUE SHARING

ARRANGEMENTS FROM JANUARY 2001 UNTIL MAY 2003, (II) FAILED TO PROPERLY DISCLOSE

SUCH REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS IN ITS BROKERAGE CONFIRMATIONS AND (III)

RECEIVED DIRECTED BROKERAGE FROM JANUARY 2001 UNTIL DECEMBER 2003. THE NOTICE

FROM THE NASD STAFF IS INTENDED TO GIVE AEFA AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE

ISSUES IT HAS RAISED. AEFA HAS BEEN AVAILING ITSELF OF THIS OPPORTUNITY AND

CONTINUES TO COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE NASD'S INQUIRY REGARDING THIS MATTER, AS

WELL AS WITH ALL OTHER REGULATORY INQUIRIES.

ON FEBRUARY 17, 2005, THE NEW HAMPSHIRE BUREAU OF SECURITIES REGULATION

FILED A PETITION AGAINST AEFA. THE PETITION ALLEGES THAT AEFA VIOLATED NEW

HAMPSHIRE AND FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE REVENUE SHARING AND

DIRECTED BROKERAGE PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS FOR

AGREEING TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS AVAILABLE THROUGH AEFA'S NATIONAL DISTRIBUTION

NETWORK. THE PETITION ALSO ALLEGES THAT AEFA FAILED TO DISCLOSE INCENTIVES FOR

ADVISORS TO SELL PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND OTHER ALLEGED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

THE PETITION SEEKS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WHY AEFA'S

BROKER-DEALER LICENSE SHOULD NOT BE DENIED, SUSPENDED OR REVOKED, A PROPOSED

FINE AND RESTITUTION OF FINANCIAL PLANNING FEES DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD

(PRINCIPALLY 1999 TO 2003) IN THE AMOUNT OF $17.5 MILLION, AND DISGORGEMENT OF

REVENUE SHARING AND DIRECTED BROKERAGE PAYMENTS AND OTHER RELIEF. AEFA INTENDS

TO COOPERATE FULLY IN THIS MATTER.

IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, IN FEBRUARY, 2004 AEFA WAS ONE OF 15 FIRMS

THAT SETTLED AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION BROUGHT BY THE SEC AND THE NASD RELATING TO

BREAKPOINT DISCOUNTS (I.E., VOLUME DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS WHO MAKE

LARGE MUTUAL FUND PURCHASES) PURSUANT TO WHICH AEFA AGREED TO PAY A FINE OF $3.7

MILLION AND TO REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS TO WHOM THE FIRM FAILED TO DELIVER SUCH

DISCOUNTS.

IN JUNE 2004, AN ACTION CAPTIONED JOHN E. GALLUS ET AL. V. AMERICAN

EXPRESS FINANCIAL CORP. AND AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS, INC. WAS FILED

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA. THE PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE THAT THEY ARE INVESTORS IN SEVERAL "AXP" MUTUAL FUNDS AND THEY PURPORT TO

BRING THE ACTION DERIVATIVELY ON BEHALF OF THOSE FUNDS UNDER THE INVESTMENT

COMPANY ACT OF 1940. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT FEES ALLEGEDLY PAID TO THE

DEFENDANTS BY THE FUNDS FOR INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ARE

EXCESSIVE. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK REMEDIES INCLUDING RESTITUTION AND RESCISSION OF

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS. THE PLAINTIFFS VOLUNTARILY

AGREED TO TRANSFER THIS CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA. THE COMPANY HAS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT.
