ITEM 1. BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY (INCLUDING ITS SUBSIDIARIES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT

INDICATES OTHERWISE, THE "COMPANY") WAS FOUNDED IN 1850 AS A JOINT STOCK

ASSOCIATION AND WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN

1965. THE COMPANY IS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING TRAVEL

RELATED SERVICES, FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND INTERNATIONAL BANKING SERVICES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN INVESTOR RELATIONS WEB SITE ON THE INTERNET AT

HTTP://IR.AMERICANEXPRESS.COM. THE COMPANY'S FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("SEC"), INCLUDING ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY

REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K AND ALL AMENDMENTS TO THOSE

REPORTS ARE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE FOLLOWING

THE TIME THEY ARE FILED WITH OR FURNISHED TO THE SEC BY CLICKING ON THE "SEC

FILINGS" LINK FOUND ON THE INVESTOR RELATIONS HOMEPAGE. INTERESTED PERSONS ARE

ALSO ABLE TO ACCESS THE COMPANY'S INVESTOR RELATIONS WEB SITE THROUGH THE

COMPANY'S MAIN WEB SITE AT WWW.AMERICANEXPRESS.COM BY CLICKING ON THE "ABOUT

AMERICAN EXPRESS" LINK, WHICH IS LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE COMPANY'S

HOMEPAGE. INFORMATION ON SUCH WEBSITE IS NOT INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS

REPORT.

AMERICAN EXPRESS ACHIEVED RECORD EARNINGS IN 2003, WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASING ITS INVESTMENTS IN ITS BUSINESSES TO GENERATE FUTURE GROWTH. THE

COMPANY ENTERED THE YEAR IN A DEFENSIVE POSTURE AND WITH A CAUTIOUS VIEW OF THE

ENVIRONMENT AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED WEAK CORPORATE SPENDING AND EQUITY MARKETS,

THE WAR IN IRAQ AND SARS. NONETHELESS, DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR, THE

COMPANY WAS ABLE TO BUILD STRONG MOMENTUM AS EQUITY MARKETS GAINED STRENGTH, THE

U.S. ECONOMY GREW AND THE GLOBAL TRAVEL INDUSTRY BEGAN TO GROW AGAIN FROM THE

DEPRESSED LEVELS OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD BUSINESS, STRONG

CREDIT QUALITY, THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY'S ONGOING REENGINEERING EFFORTS

(WHICH YIELDED BENEFITS IN EXCESS OF $1 BILLION FOR THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE YEAR)

AND PROGRESS AT AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS ("AEFA") ALL PLAYED A ROLE

IN 2003 PERFORMANCE. FOR THE YEAR, THE COMPANY DELIVERED.

O    REVENUES OF $25.9 BILLION, UP 9% FROM $23.8 BILLION IN 2002

O    NET INCOME OF $2.99 BILLION, UP 12% FROM $2.67 BILLION IN 2002

O    DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.30, UP 14% FROM $2.01 IN 2002

O    RETURN ON EQUITY OF 20.6%, COMPARED WITH 20.2% IN 2002

FOR A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING

FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING EACH OF THE COMPANY'S THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS,

SEE PAGES 27 THROUGH 108 OF THE COMPANY'S 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

(THE "2003 ANNUAL REPORT"), WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. FOR

A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND DISCUSSION OF THE

COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF REVENUE, SEE PAGES 78 THROUGH 80 OF THE 2003

ANNUAL REPORT.

---------------

* VARIOUS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE MADE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K, WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDE THE WORDS "BELIEVE," "EXPECT,"

"ANTICIPATE," "OPTIMISTIC," "INTEND," "PLAN," "AIM," "WILL," "MAY," "SHOULD,"

"COULD," "WOULD," "LIKELY" AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS. CERTAIN FACTORS THAT

MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED ON PAGES 65-70.

1

THESE RESULTS MET OR EXCEEDED THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM TARGETS OF 12% TO 15%

EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH, 8% REVENUE GROWTH AND 18% TO 20% RETURN ON EQUITY, ON

AVERAGE AND OVER TIME.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS 2003 RESULTS REFLECT ITS ABILITY TO

CAPITALIZE ON THE CHANGES IT BEGAN TO INITIATE IN 2001 TO BUILD A MORE FLEXIBLE

AND ADAPTABLE BUSINESS. THESE CHANGES FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE COMPANY'S

ECONOMICS, DIVERSIFYING ITS CARD BUSINESS, LOWERING ITS RISK AND INVESTING IN

GROWTH. THEY WERE DESIGNED TO HELP THE COMPANY MEET ITS LONG-TERM FINANCIAL

TARGETS IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND MARKET APPRECIATION. IN

ADDITION, THESE CHANGES WERE INTENDED TO HELP IT CAPITALIZE QUICKLY ON IMPROVING

MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT WAS ABLE TO DO IN 2003 AS IT

INCREASED EXPENDITURES IN BUSINESS BUILDING INITIATIVES AS THE ECONOMY AND

MARKETS IMPROVED DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE YEAR. THESE EXPENDITURES WERE

USED FOR THE LAUNCH OF MANY NEW CARD PRODUCTS, INCREASED MARKETING EFFORTS AND

THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF TWO TARGETED ACQUISITIONS, ALL OF WHICH HELPED TO

DRIVE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER GROWTH IN CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND LOANS AT THE TRS

OPERATING SEGMENT AND HIGHER RESULTS AT THE AEFA OPERATING SEGMENT.

TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES

AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. (INCLUDING ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE, "TRS"), WHICH INCLUDES THE

COMPANY'S CARD, TRAVEL, MERCHANT AND NETWORK BUSINESSES, PROVIDES A VARIETY OF

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, GLOBAL CARD NETWORK,

ISSUING AND PROCESSING SERVICES, CUSTOMIZED CHARGE CARD AND CREDIT CARDS FOR

CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE, OTHER CONSUMER AND CORPORATE LENDING AND

BANKING PRODUCTS, AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARD

PRODUCTS, BUSINESS EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, CORPORATE TRAVEL

AND TRAVEL MANAGEMENT SERVICES, CONSUMER TRAVEL SERVICES, TAX, ACCOUNTING AND

BUSINESS CONSULTING SERVICES, MAGAZINE PUBLISHING, MERCHANT TRANSACTION

PROCESSING AND POINT-OF-SALE AND BACK-OFFICE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, PARTLY OWNED AFFILIATES AND UNAFFILIATED ENTITIES OFFER SOME OF THESE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER LICENSES FROM TRS.

TRS' GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK AND CARD ISSUING BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL IN

SCOPE. TRS IS A WORLD LEADER IN PROVIDING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO CONSUMERS,

SMALL BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' CARDS ARE CURRENTLY

ISSUED IN 47 CURRENCIES, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER

QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS. IN 2003, TRS' WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS (SPENDING ON

AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS $352

BILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY $90 BILLION COMING FROM CARDMEMBERS DOMICILED

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CARDS PERMIT CARDMEMBERS TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS

AND SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT THE MILLIONS OF MERCHANTS

THAT ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. IN 2003, TRS ROLLED OUT NUMEROUS NEW CARD

PRODUCTS AND ENTERED INTO VARIOUS COBRAND AND OTHER CARD ARRANGEMENTS. TRS ADDED

A NET TOTAL OF 3.5 MILLION CARDS IN 2003, BRINGING TOTAL WORLDWIDE

CARDS-IN-FORCE TO 60.5 MILLION (INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES). AS A

RESULT OF THE GLOBAL REACH OF AMERICAN EXPRESS' BRAND, ITS CARD ISSUING

CAPABILITIES AND ITS GENERAL PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, THE COMPANY IS POSITIONED TO

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS SERVICES

BUSINESS.

2

FURTHER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS "SPEND-CENTRIC" BUSINESS MODEL HAS

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. CARD ISSUERS GENERATE THE MAJORITY OF THEIR

INCOME THROUGH SOME COMBINATION OF CUSTOMER SPENDING (WHICH GENERATES PAYMENTS

FROM MERCHANTS FOR CARD TRANSACTIONS), LENDING (WHICH GENERATES FINANCE CHARGES

ON REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES) AND CUSTOMER FEES. THE COMPANY HAS STRENGTH IN ALL

THREE REVENUE STREAMS, BUT HAS A UNIQUE EDGE IN SPENDING. ON AVERAGE, U.S.

CONSUMERS SPEND ABOUT FOUR TIMES AS MUCH ON THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AS THEY

DO ON OTHER CARDS. TRS GENERATES REVENUE FROM THIS SPENDING THROUGH THE DISCOUNT

RATE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR CARD TRANSACTIONS. BECAUSE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS

CARDMEMBERS' SPENDING PATTERNS, TRS CAN DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN

THE FORM OF HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS AND THEREFORE EARN A PREMIUM DISCOUNT

RATE. AS A RESULT, TRS CAN GENERATE HIGHER REVENUES FROM SPENDING AND HAS THE

FLEXIBILITY TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO KEEP

CUSTOMERS SPENDING MORE ON THEIR CARDS. THIS, IN TURN, DRIVES MORE BUSINESS TO

MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT THE CARD. THIS BUSINESS MODEL GIVES TRS A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE THAT TRS SEEKS TO LEVERAGE TO PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO ITS CUSTOMERS,

MERCHANTS AND CARD-ISSUING PARTNERS.

TRS' BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATION, ALTHOUGH TRAVEL SALES TEND TO BE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER,

TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES OUTSTANDING TEND TO BE GREATEST

EACH YEAR IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD QUARTER, AND CARD-BILLED

BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IN OTHER

QUARTERS.

TRS PLACES SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON ITS TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS AND

DILIGENTLY PROTECTS ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

TRS OPERATES A GLOBAL GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK.

NETWORK FUNCTIONS INCLUDE OPERATIONS, SERVICE DELIVERY, SYSTEMS, AUTHORIZATION,

CLEARING, SETTLEMENT AND BRAND ADVERTISING AND MARKETING; THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS FOR THE NETWORK; AND ESTABLISHING AND ENHANCING

RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS GLOBALLY, BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE. SINCE MAY 1996,

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN PURSUING A STRATEGY OF INVITING U.S. BANKS AND OTHER

INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

MERCHANT NETWORK, BUILDING ON A BUSINESS STRATEGY IT HAS IMPLEMENTED

SUCCESSFULLY IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. BY LEVERAGING

ITS GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, THE

COMPANY AIMS TO GAIN EVEN BROADER REACH FOR ITS NETWORK WORLDWIDE. AMERICAN

EXPRESS HAS ESTABLISHED 79 CARD-ISSUING PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS IN 89

COUNTRIES. IN JANUARY 2004, TRS AND MBNA AMERICA BANK, NA ("MBNA") SIGNED AN

AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH MBNA WILL ISSUE ITS OWN AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CREDIT

CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CONFIRMED PLANS FOR MBNA TO ISSUE AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED CREDIT CARDS IN CANADA, SPAIN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. AS A

RESULT OF THIS AGREEMENT, MBNA WILL BECOME THE FIRST MAJOR U.S. BANK TO ISSUE

CREDIT CARDS THAT ARE ACCEPTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT NETWORK. MBNA'S

ISSUANCE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS IS SUBJECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF VISA

USA, INC.'S ("VISA") AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INCORPORATED'S ("MASTERCARD")

RULES PROHIBITING SUCH ISSUANCE (SEE THE DISCUSSION BELOW DESCRIBING THE

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LITIGATION).

3

ONE OF THE KEY ASSETS OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT NETWORK IS THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST HIGHLY RECOGNIZED AND

RESPECTED BRANDS. CARDS BEARING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS LOGO ("CARDS") ARE ISSUED

BY TRS AND BY QUALIFIED LICENSED INSTITUTIONS, AND ARE ACCEPTED AT ATMS AND AT

ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. TRS

ISSUES THE VAST MAJORITY OF CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS ("GNS") OF TRS AUTHORIZES THIRD-PARTY

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS THAT ARE ACCEPTED

ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT NETWORK. WHILE TRS' NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS ARE

CUSTOMIZED TO THE PARTICULAR MARKET AND PARTNER REQUIREMENTS, ALL GNS

PARTNERSHIPS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ITS PARTNERS DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR THEIR

HIGH-SPENDING AND BEST CUSTOMERS. NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE INDEPENDENT

OPERATOR ("IO") ARRANGEMENTS, UNDER WHICH GNS' PARTNER ISSUES LOCAL CURRENCY

AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS IN A PARTICULAR MARKET AND SERVES AS THE LOCAL MERCHANT

ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR; JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS, UNDER WHICH A JOINT VENTURE

IN WHICH TRS HAS AN OWNERSHIP STAKE ACTS AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND ISSUES

CARDS LOCALLY; AND NON-PROPRIETARY LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS, UNDER WHICH TRS GRANTS

THE PARTNER A LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND THE PARTNER OWNS THE

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, PROVIDES SERVICE, BILLING, AND CREDIT MANAGEMENT AND

DESIGNS THE CARD PRODUCT FEATURES AND TRS PROCESSES THE TRANSACTIONS AND

MAINTAINS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS. IN 2003, TRS ALSO

ENTERED INTO SEVERAL ARRANGEMENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE GNS

PARTNER ACTS AS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER IN A PARTICULAR MARKET, BUT DOES NOT

ISSUE CARDS. TRS CHOOSES GNS PARTNERS WHO SHARE A CORE SET OF ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS

COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS, STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE AND

COMPATIBILITY WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, AND TRS REQUIRES ITS GNS PARTNERS

TO ADHERE TO ITS PRODUCT, BRAND AND SERVICE STANDARDS.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO NINE NEW GNS RELATIONSHIPS WITH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. GNS PARTNERS LAUNCHED A TOTAL OF 30 NEW PRODUCTS DURING 2003,

BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS PARTNER PRODUCTS TO

OVER 350. IN 2003, FOR EXAMPLE, NEDCOR BANK LAUNCHED A GOLD CREDIT CARD AND

A GOLD CORPORATE CARD IN SOUTH AFRICA, BANCO COMERCIAL PORTUGUES LAUNCHED

BLUE V2, THE FIRST CREDIT CARD WITH A SMART CHIP IN PORTUGAL AND THE NATIONS

TRUST BANK IN SRI LANKA ISSUED AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL AND GOLD CREDIT CARDS.

GNS IS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC BUSINESS THAT HELPS TO INCREASE AMERICAN

EXPRESS' MARKET PRESENCE, DRIVE MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS MERCHANT NETWORK AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. SINCE THE CREATION OF THE GNS BUSINESS IN 1997, GNS

PARTNERS HAVE ADDED 6.4 MILLION NEW CARDS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (NET

OF ATTRITION). IN ADDITION, GNS MERCHANT ACQUIRING PARTNERS HAVE ADDED MORE THAN

2.5 MILLION NEW ESTABLISHMENTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD.

SINCE 1999, CARDS-IN-FORCE ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS HAVE GROWN AT A COMPOUNDED

ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 24%. SPENDING ON THESE CARDS HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUNDED

ANNUAL RATE OF 16% AND TOTALED MORE THAN $12 BILLION IN 2003.

GNS' SOURCES OF REVENUES IN IO ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE FEES THAT ARE LARGELY

DRIVEN BY THE NUMBER OF CARDS ISSUED AND SPENDING ON THOSE CARDS. THE CREDIT

RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS RESIDES WITH THE LOCAL ISSUER, NOT WITH THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, TRS BENEFITS FROM EXPANDED MERCHANT

4

COVERAGE, WHICH ACCOMMODATES MORE INBOUND SPENDING BY CARDMEMBERS FROM OTHER

PARTS OF THE WORLD. IN JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS, THE ECONOMICS OF THE JOINT

VENTURE ARE SIMILAR TO TRS' PROPRIETARY BUSINESS, AND TRS RECEIVES ITS

CONTRACTUAL PORTION OF THE VENTURE'S INCOME.

GNS' REVENUES IN NON-PROPRIETARY LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS ARE DERIVED FROM THE

LEVEL OF CARDHOLDER SPENDING, ROYALTIES AND FEES CHARGED TO THE CARD ISSUER

BASED ON TRANSACTION VOLUME, AND THE PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED ISSUER SERVICES

SUCH AS INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND CONSULTING SERVICES. THE GNS PARTNER BEARS THE

CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL AS THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION

COSTS, FRAUD COSTS AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND OTHER LOYALTY INITIATIVES; HOWEVER,

TRS DOES BEAR THE RISK ARISING FROM THE GNS PARTNER'S POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET

ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO TRS AS A RESULT OF THE GNS PARTNER'S INABILITY OR

UNWILLINGNESS TO MAKE PAYMENT TO TRS IN RESPECT OF TRANSACTIONS MADE ON THE

COMPANY'S NETWORK. TRS MITIGATES THIS RISK BY SELECTING GNS PARTNERS WHOM IT

BELIEVES WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND BY MONITORING ITS GNS PARTNERS'

FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH TRS

AND THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN CERTAIN

INSTANCES, TRS MAY REQUIRE GNS PARTNERS TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK

GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

EVEN THOUGH TRS' GROSS REVENUES FROM GNS BUSINESS VOLUMES ARE LOWER THAN

FROM TRS' PROPRIETARY ISSUING BUSINESS, SINCE THE GNS PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR MOST OF THE OPERATING COSTS AND RISK, TRS' EXPENSES ARE LOWER AS WELL. THE

RESULT IS A HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE, REQUIRING

MODEST CAPITAL SUPPORT. THE LEVERAGE INHERENT IN THE GNS BUSINESS COST

STRUCTURE IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND WILL BECOME EVEN MORE VALUABLE AS THE GNS

BUSINESS GROWS. SINCE THE MAJORITY OF GNS COSTS ARE FIXED, THE GNS BUSINESS IS

HIGHLY SCALABLE. GNS PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS BRAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND

AND DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS.

LOCAL RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING TRS' ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS

AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH SUCH ARRANGEMENTS

EXIST, BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY LICENSED TO

ISSUE CARDS (E.G., VISA AND MASTERCARD CARDS) PRIOR TO THEIR ISSUING CARDS ON

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. ACCORDINGLY, TRS' GNS PARTNERS HAVE GENERALLY NOT

HAD DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE MARKETS

IN WHICH TRS HAS CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO THESE PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS.

IN CONTRAST TO THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHERE BANKS AND

OTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONS HAVE ISSUED CARDS ON THE NETWORK FOR MANY YEARS,

THERE HAVE BEEN NO MAJOR U.S. BANKS ISSUING CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS SITUATION IS THE RESULT OF RULES AND POLICIES

OF VISA AND MASTERCARD IN THE UNITED STATES CALLING FOR EXPULSION OF MEMBERS WHO

ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. NO BANKS HAVE BEEN WILLING TO FORFEIT

MEMBERSHIP IN VISA AND/OR MASTERCARD TO ISSUE CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

NETWORK. IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN OCTOBER 1998 AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD, THE

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALLEGED THAT THESE RULES AND POLICIES VIOLATE THE

ANTITRUST LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. IN OCTOBER 2001, THE TRIAL JUDGE RULED IN

FAVOR OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, HOLDING THAT THESE RULES AND POLICIES

DO VIOLATE SUCH LAWS. TRS VIEWS THIS DECISION AS A MAJOR VICTORY FOR U.S.

CONSUMERS BECAUSE IT WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO MORE VIGOROUS NETWORK COMPETITION

AND MORE INNOVATIVE CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

VISA AND MASTERCARD APPEALED THE DECISION AND OBTAINED A STAY OF THE

COURT'S JUDGMENT DURING THE APPEALS PROCESS. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE U.S. COURT

OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION, AND IN

JANUARY 2004, THE COURT OF APPEALS DENIED VISA AND MASTERCARD'S MOTIONS FOR

REHEARING. IN FEBRUARY 2004, THE COURT OF APPEALS CONTINUED THE STAY OF THE

TRIAL COURT'S JUDGMENT WHILE VISA AND MASTERCARD FILE PETITIONS FOR CERTIORARI

WITH THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S

AFFIRMATION OF THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION, FOLLOWED BY ITS DENIAL OF VISA AND

MASTERCARD'S MOTIONS FOR REHEARING, THE COMPANY

5

HAS RENEWED ITS DISCUSSIONS WITH BANKS ABOUT ESTABLISHING NETWORK PARTNERSHIP

AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN THIS REGARD, AS STATED ABOVE, THE COMPANY

ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT WITH MBNA IN JANUARY 2004 UNDER WHICH MBNA WILL ISSUE

AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CREDIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES ONCE VISA AND

MASTERCARD'S RULES ARE NO LONGER IN PLACE.

AS A NETWORK, TRS COMPETES WITH OTHER CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB, DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES, A BUSINESS

UNIT OF MORGAN STANLEY (PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES), AND JCB CO., LTD.

(PRIMARILY IN ASIA). THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK

BUSINESS ARE (I) THE NUMBER OF CARDS IN FORCE AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THESE

CARDS; (II) THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT THE CARDS;

(III) THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS OF

PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK; (IV) THE SUCCESS OF TARGETED MARKETING AND

PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; (V) REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION; (VI) INNOVATION IN

SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS; AND (VII) THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER

SERVICE.

GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES

TRS OPERATES A GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING-UP

MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND RECEIVING, PROCESSING AND PAYING

CARDMEMBER CHARGES FOR MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS. DURING 2003, TRS CONTINUED

ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO USE THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD AS

THEIR CARD OF CHOICE FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING AT ESTABLISHMENTS, AS WELL AS FOR

THEIR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING. TRS ALSO CONTINUED TO INCREASE THE

RANGE OF MERCHANTS IN RETAIL AND EVERYDAY SPENDING CATEGORIES THAT ACCEPT THE

CARD, SUCH AS QUICK-SERVE RESTAURANTS, RETAIL STORES, SUPERMARKETS AND GAS

STATIONS.

OTHER KEY SIGNINGS OF MERCHANTS ALSO HELPED THE COMPANY TO BRING CARD

ACCEPTANCE TO INDUSTRIES WHERE CASH OR CHECKS ARE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF

PAYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, TRS SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH EIGHT MAJOR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

COMPANIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES TO ACCEPT THE CARD FOR RENTAL PAYMENTS AT

THEIR LUXURY PROPERTIES BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER TO TEN. TRS ALSO SIGNED AIG

MARKETING, INC. TO ACCEPT THE CARD FOR INSURANCE PREMIUM PAYMENTS.

TRS' OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE MERCHANT COVERAGE WHEREVER AND HOWEVER

CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD, AS WELL AS TO INCREASE COVERAGE IN KEY

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND NEW INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT, TO DATE, ACCEPTED GENERAL

PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT. TRS ADDS NEW MERCHANTS TO

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER OF SALES CHANNELS: A PROPRIETARY

SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY SALES AGENTS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH BANKS, THE

INTERNET, TELEMARKETING AND INBOUND "WANT TO HONOR" CALLS (I.E., MERCHANTS

DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD CONTACTING THE COMPANY DIRECTLY).

AS IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2003, TRS CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE

OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO REFINE ITS APPROACH TO

CALCULATING MERCHANT COVERAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE.

GLOBALLY, ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS CONTINUES TO

INCREASE, INCLUDING AMONG MERCHANTS THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED CHARGE

AND CREDIT CARDS. ADDITIONALLY, AS THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS SIGNS

PARTNERS IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHO HELP TO GROW MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE IN

THEIR LOCAL MARKETS, AND AS AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ISSUANCE EXPANDS IN "EMERGING

MARKETS" OUTSIDE THE

6

UNITED STATES, TRS HAS BEGUN TO INCLUDE MERCHANT COVERAGE INFORMATION FROM GNS

MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND FROM THESE "EMERGING MARKETS". AS A RESULT OF THIS

REFINED APPROACH, TRS ESTIMATES THAT, AS OF THE END OF 2003, TRS' MERCHANT

NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN 90% OF CARDMEMBERS' GENERAL

PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING, AND ITS INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT NETWORK

ACCOMMODATED OVER 80% OF CARDMEMBERS' GENERAL PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD

SPENDING.

TRS EARNS "DISCOUNT" REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO "SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS"

FOR ACCEPTING CARDS. THE DISCOUNT, WHICH IS THE FEE CHARGED TO THE SERVICE

ESTABLISHMENT FOR ACCEPTING CARDS, IS DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT

THAT THE "MERCHANT ACQUIRER" (GENERALLY TRS) PAYS TO A SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT FOR

CHARGES SUBMITTED. A SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT IS DEFINED AS A MERCHANT THAT ENTERS

INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACCEPT CARDS AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE

SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT, RECEIVES ALL CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE SERVICE

ESTABLISHMENT, PAYS THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS

THE TRANSACTIONS TO TRS, WHICH IN TURN SUBMITS THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE CARD

ISSUER FOR BILLING TO THE CARDMEMBER. WHEN A CARDMEMBER PRESENTS THE CARD FOR

PAYMENT, THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR THE

TRANSACTION AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT. THE DISCOUNT IS

DEDUCTED FROM PAYMENT TO THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT WHERE TRS IS THE MERCHANT

ACQUIRER AND IS RECORDED BY TRS AS DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE TIME THE TRANSACTION

IS CAPTURED. WHERE TRS ACTS AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE CARD PRESENTED AT A

SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT IS ISSUED BY A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION,

SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF SOME OF TRS' GNS PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS, TRS WILL MAKE

FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE CARD ISSUER. SUCH SHARED AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED BY

TRS AS A REDUCTION OF DISCOUNT REVENUE. WHERE THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A

THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TRS ALSO RECEIVES A PORTION OF THE

DISCOUNT REVENUE CHARGED TO SUCH SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS. SUCH AMOUNTS SHARED

WITH AND PAID TO TRS ARE RECORDED BY TRS AS DISCOUNT REVENUE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE, WHICH IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE

AMOUNT CHARGED ON A CARD, IS CONTRACTUALLY AGREED WITH THE SERVICE

ESTABLISHMENT. THE LEVEL OF THE DISCOUNT RATE CHARGED BY TRS IS PRINCIPALLY

DETERMINED BY THE VALUE THAT IS DELIVERED TO THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT AND

GENERALLY INCLUDES A PREMIUM OVER OTHER CARD NETWORKS. VALUE IS DELIVERED TO THE

SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS RELATIVE TO COMPETING

CARD NETWORKS, THE VOLUME OF SPENDING BY ALL CARDMEMBERS, MARKETING PROGRAMS AND

THE INSISTENCE OF CARDMEMBERS TO USE THEIR CARDS WHEN ENROLLED IN REWARDS OR

OTHER CARD LOYALTY PROGRAMS.

THE DISCOUNT RATE VARIES WITH THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE SERVICE

ESTABLISHMENT DOES BUSINESS, THE CHARGE VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT

TO THE SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN

CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE SCOPE OF THE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH TRS

(LOCAL OR GLOBAL), THE AVERAGE CHARGE AMOUNT AND THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION

PROVIDED. TRS HAS GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES TO

PARTICIPATING SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS THAN ITS COMPETITORS AS A RESULT OF TRS'

ATTRACTIVE CARDMEMBER BASE. IN 2003, AS IN PRIOR YEARS, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED

SOME EROSION IN ITS DISCOUNT RATE, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF STRONGER

THAN AVERAGE GROWTH IN THE LOWER RATE "EVERYDAY SPEND" MERCHANT CATEGORIES.

BASED ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS STRATEGY, IT EXPECTS TO SEE CONTINUED CHANGES IN

THE MIX OF BUSINESS. THIS, ALONG WITH VOLUME-RELATED PRICING DISCOUNTS

7

AND SELECTIVE RE-PRICING INITIATIVES, WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN SOME

DISCOUNT RATE EROSION OVER TIME.

WHILE MANY ESTABLISHMENTS UNDERSTAND THE PRICING IN RELATION TO THE VALUE

PROVIDED, TRS HAS CONTINUED TO ENCOUNTER MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS, BUT PREFER

ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT AND, CONSEQUENTLY, SUPPRESS USE OF THE CARD. TRS

CONTINUES TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE, AND HAS MADE

PROGRESS BY CONCENTRATING ON ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE

THE CARD, PROVIDING BETTER AND EARLIER COMMUNICATION OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

VALUE PROPOSITION AND, WHEN NECESSARY, BY CANCELING MERCHANTS WHO SUPPRESS USE

OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

TRS FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING KEY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE

MERCHANT SATISFACTION, ON EXECUTING PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT

MERCHANTS AND ON STRENGTHENING ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS THROUGH AN

EXPANDED ROSTER OF SERVICES THAT HELP THEM MEET THEIR BUSINESS GOALS. TRS OFFERS

A FULL RANGE OF POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW ITS MERCHANT PARTNERS TO

ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AS WELL AS BANKCARDS, DEBIT CARDS AND CHECKS. ALL

PROPRIETARY POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS SUPPORT DIRECT PROCESSING (I.E., DIRECT

CONNECTIVITY) TO AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH LOWERS A MERCHANT'S COST OF CARD

ACCEPTANCE AND AVOIDS ANY PAYMENT DELAYS CAUSED BY A THIRD PARTY.

IN 2003, TRS INTRODUCED SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY WITHIN ITS POINT-OF-SALE

PRODUCT PORTFOLIO TO MEET THE INCREASING MERCHANT DEMAND FOR HIGH SPEED CREDIT

CARD PROCESSING. TRS CONTINUES TO INVEST IN VARIOUS BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY

OPTIONS, INCLUDING WIRELESS AND IP-BASED TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO FACILITATE CARD

ACCEPTANCE IN NEW AND EMERGING INDUSTRIES.

TRS CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE FAST-GROWING RECURRING BILLING INDUSTRY

THROUGH THE AUTOMATED BILL PAYMENT PLATFORM, A PRODUCT THAT ALLOWS MERCHANTS TO

BILL CARDMEMBERS ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR REPEATED CHARGES SUCH AS INSURANCE

PREMIUMS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS. IN 2003, TRS ALSO MADE MODIFICATIONS TO ITS HOST

AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM IN ORDER TO APPROVE MORE TRANSACTIONS AND REDUCE CARDMEMBER

DISRUPTION AT THE POINT-OF-SALE WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN FRAUD OR

CREDIT LOSSES. THESE ENHANCEMENTS WERE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE RECURRING

BILLING INDUSTRY. TRS ALSO INTRODUCED ADDRESS VERIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS, WHICH

ASSIST MERCHANTS IN REDUCING THE RISK OF FRAUD BY VALIDATING ADDRESSES FOR

SHIPMENTS TO ADDRESSES OTHER THAN THE CARDMEMBER'S BILLING ADDRESS.

WHEREVER TRS MANAGES BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS AND THE

CARD-ISSUING SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A "CLOSED LOOP," WHICH DISTINGUISHES

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK FROM THE BANKCARD NETWORKS IN THAT THERE IS ACCESS

TO INFORMATION AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD TRANSACTION. THIS ENABLES TRS TO PROVIDE

TARGETED MARKETING FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A

VARIETY OF CHANNELS. IN ADDITION, THE CLOSED LOOP ALLOWS TRS'S CARD-ISSUING BANK

PARTNERS TO FURTHER CUSTOMIZE MARKETING EFFORTS AND TO WORK WITH TRS TO DRIVE

BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT THE CARD.

TRS, AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, HAS CERTAIN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES THAT

ARISE IN THE EVENT THAT A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS

SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE CARDMEMBER. DRIVERS OF THIS LIABILITY ARE RETURNS IN THE

NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER QUALITY OR NON-

8

DELIVERY, AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, THE AMOUNT DUE TO THE CARDMEMBER IS

OFFSET AGAINST CURRENT OR FUTURE SUBMISSIONS FROM THE MERCHANT. TRS CAN REALIZE

LOSSES WHEN OFFSETTING SUBMISSIONS CEASE, SUCH AS WHEN THE MERCHANT COMMENCES A

BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. TRS ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS

MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE RISK OF THIS EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY

WILL TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN MERCHANT BY EITHER

HOLDING A SET AMOUNT OF THE MERCHANT'S FUNDS OR LENGTHENING THE TIME BETWEEN

WHEN THE MERCHANT SUBMITS A CHARGE FOR PAYMENT AND WHEN TRS PAYS THE MERCHANT.

TRS ALSO HOLDS RESERVES AGAINST THESE CONTINGENCIES.

IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST ON THE PART OF A

NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD REGARDING THE FEES INVOLVED IN

THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE FEES THAT MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO

ACCEPT CARDS. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPEAN

UNION, AUSTRALIA AND SWITZERLAND HAVE CONDUCTED, AND ARE CONTINUING TO CONDUCT,

INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE WAY THAT BANKCARD NETWORK MEMBERS COLLECTIVELY SET THE

"INTERCHANGE," WHICH IS THE FEE PAID BY THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE

CARD-ISSUING BANK. THE INTERCHANGE FEE IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE

MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS BY THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER WITH

RESPECT TO BANKCARD CHARGES. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS' FOCUS HAS FOR THE MOST

PART BEEN SPECIFICALLY ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS,

GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE CARD ASSOCIATIONS' PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT

ALL CARD SERVICE PROVIDERS BY MANDATING REDUCTION OF THE LEVELS OF INTERCHANGE

AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT. DOWNWARD MOVEMENT OF INTERCHANGE AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT

FEES MAY IMPACT THE RELATIVE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND

MERCHANT ACQUIRERS OF PARTICIPATING IN A PARTICULAR NETWORK, AND MAY DRIVE CARD

SERVICE PROVIDERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS ANNUAL CARD FEES,

AS WELL AS REDUCTION OF COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

IN SPAIN, A PARLIAMENTARY RESOLUTION IN 2003 CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE

ACTION TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE. IN OCTOBER 2003, NEW

REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA CAME INTO FORCE THAT LIMIT

THE INTERCHANGE FEES THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD MAY CHARGE TO A "COST" BASIS

FORMULA. AMERICAN EXPRESS AND DINERS CLUB WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF

THESE REGULATIONS. HOWEVER, AMERICAN EXPRESS AND DINERS CLUB MAY FACE INCREASED

PRESSURE ON MERCHANT RATES IN AUSTRALIA AS THE VISA AND MASTERCARD RATES ARE

LOWERED.

REGULATORS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED THE INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF PROHIBITING

MERCHANTS FROM PASSING THE COST OF MERCHANT DISCOUNT FEES ALONG TO CONSUMERS

THROUGH SURCHARGES ON CARD PURCHASES. AS A RESULT OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE RESERVE

BANK OF AUSTRALIA, AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003, MERCHANTS IN AUSTRALIA ARE PERMITTED

TO SURCHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD TRANSACTIONS. TO

DATE, ONLY LIMITED INCIDENCE OF SURCHARGING HAS OCCURRED IN AUSTRALIA. ALTHOUGH

SURCHARGING OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES HAS BEEN PERMITTED IN OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH

AS THE UNITED KINGDOM, FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LOW

INCIDENCE OF SURCHARGING, AS MERCHANTS DO NOT WISH TO RISK OFFENDING CUSTOMERS

OR LOSING CUSTOMERS TO COMPETITORS WHO DO NOT SURCHARGE.

IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, THIRD PARTY PROCESSORS HAVE BEGUN TO OFFER MERCHANTS THE CAPABILITY OF

CONVERTING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF

THE CARDHOLDER'S RESIDENCE (I.E., THE CARDHOLDER'S BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE, AND SUBMITTING THE TRANSACTION IN THE

9

CARDHOLDER'S BILLING CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY

CONVERSION PROCESS OF THE CARD NETWORK AND CARD ISSUER. THE MERCHANT AND

PROCESSOR WOULD RETAIN SOME OR ALL OF THE REVENUE RESULTING FROM THE

POINT-OF-SALE CONVERSION, THUS REDUCING OR ELIMINATING REVENUE FOR CARD ISSUERS

AND CARD NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CHARGES TO THE BILLING

CURRENCY. THIS PRACTICE IS NOT WIDESPREAD, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT

CONSUMERS WILL PREFER TO HAVE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS CONVERTED BY

MERCHANTS RATHER THAN THEIR CARD ISSUER IN ACCORDANCE WITH TERMS DISCLOSED BY

THE ISSUER IN THE CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND ELSEWHERE. AMERICAN EXPRESS IS

REVIEWING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF POINT-OF-SALE FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION ON

REVENUES AND CARDMEMBERS. AMERICAN EXPRESS' POLICY GENERALLY REQUIRES MERCHANTS

TO SUBMIT CHARGES AND BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE

TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND AMERICAN EXPRESS ITSELF CONVERTS THE TRANSACTION TO THE

CARDMEMBER'S BILLING CURRENCY.

CONSUMER CARD, SMALL BUSINESS AND CONSUMER TRAVEL SERVICES

TRS' CARD BUSINESS HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE WORLDWIDE AND SERVES A RANGE

OF CUSTOMER GROUPS, INCLUDING CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. TRS' CONSUMER CARD

BUSINESS IS COMPLEMENTED BY ITS CONSUMER TRAVEL BUSINESS, WHICH PROVIDES TRAVEL

SERVICES TO CARDMEMBERS AND OTHER CONSUMERS. TRS' CARD BUSINESS IS FOCUSED ON

OFFERING A BROAD SET OF CARD PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CUSTOMIZING EXISTING PRODUCTS

TO REACH A GREATER NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. CORE ELEMENTS OF TRS' STRATEGY ARE ITS

FOCUS ON ACQUIRING AND RETAINING HIGH-SPENDING, CREDITWORTHY CARDMEMBERS ACROSS

MULTIPLE GROUPS; ITS BREADTH OF PRODUCT OFFERING; THE USE OF STRONG INCENTIVES

TO DRIVE SPENDING ON THE CARD; THE DEVELOPMENT AND NURTURING OF WIDE-RANGING

RELATIONSHIPS WITH COBRAND, MEMBERSHIP REWARDS'R' PROGRAM AND OTHER PARTNERS; A

MULTI-CARD STRATEGY (HAVING MULTIPLE CARD PRODUCTS IN A CUSTOMER'S WALLET); AND

HIGH-QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE.

TRS AND ITS LICENSEES OFFER INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS CHARGE CARDS SUCH AS THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' GOLD CARD, THE PLATINUM CARD'R',

AND THE ULTRA-PREMIUM CENTURION'R' CARD; REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS SUCH AS BLUE

FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS'R', BLUE CASH'R' FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THE OPTIMA'R'

CARD, AMONG OTHERS; AND A VARIETY OF CARDS SPONSORED BY AND COBRANDED WITH OTHER

CORPORATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE DELTA SKYMILES'R' CREDIT CARD FROM

AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' PLATINUM CASH REBATE CARD EXCLUSIVELY

FOR COSTCO MEMBERS AND THE HILTON HHONORS PLATINUM CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN

EXPRESS.

CHARGE CARDS, WHICH ARE MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER

COUNTRIES AND CARRY NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A

METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR

SERVICES. CHARGES ARE APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A

CARDMEMBER'S ACCOUNT HISTORY, CREDIT RECORD AND PERSONAL RESOURCES. CHARGE CARDS

GENERALLY REQUIRE PAYMENT BY THE CARDMEMBER OF THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH

MONTH, AND NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST

DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT

TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE CANCELED. THE NO-PRESET-SPENDING LIMIT AND PAY-IN-FULL

NATURE OF THIS PRODUCT ATTRACTS HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS WHO WANT TO USE A

CHARGE CARD TO FACILITATE LARGER PAYMENTS.

TRS AND ITS LICENSEES ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE CARDS HAVE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT PAYMENT

TERMS, GRACE PERIODS AND RATE AND FEE STRUCTURES. SINCE LATE 1994, WHEN THE

COMPANY BEGAN AGGRESSIVELY TO EXPAND ITS CREDIT

10

CARD BUSINESS, ITS LENDING BALANCE GROWTH HAS BEEN AMONG THE TOP TIER OF CARD

ISSUERS. MUCH OF THIS GROWTH HAS BEEN DUE TO THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANY'S

LENDING PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, BLUE CASH FROM AMERICAN

EXPRESS AND THE DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, AS WELL AS THE

INCREASED NUMBER OF CHARGE CARDMEMBERS WHO HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE COMPANY'S

"LENDING ON CHARGE" OPTIONS (SUCH AS THE SIGN & TRAVEL'R' AND EXTENDED PAYMENT

OPTION PROGRAMS).

THE SIGN & TRAVEL PROGRAM GIVES QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF

EXTENDED PAYMENTS FOR AIRLINE, CRUISE AND CERTAIN TRAVEL CHARGES THAT ARE

PURCHASED WITH THE CHARGE CARD. THE EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION OFFERS QUALIFIED

U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDING PAYMENT FOR CERTAIN CHARGES ON THE

CHARGE CARD IN EXCESS OF A SPECIFIED AMOUNT. VARIOUS FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS

ARE OFFERED TO CARDMEMBERS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AS WELL.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK ("CENTURION BANK"), A WHOLLY OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF TRS, ISSUES BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, BLUE CASH FROM AMERICAN

EXPRESS, THE OPTIMA CARD, AND ALL OTHER AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED REVOLVING

CREDIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, CENTURION BANK HAS OUTSTANDING

LINES OF CREDIT IN ASSOCIATION WITH CERTAIN CHARGE CARDS AND OFFERS UNSECURED

LOANS TO CARDMEMBERS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS SIGN & TRAVEL AND EXTENDED PAYMENT

OPTION PROGRAMS. CENTURION BANK IS ALSO THE ISSUER OF CERTAIN CHARGE CARDS IN

THE UNITED STATES.

TRS CONTINUED TO BOLSTER ITS PROPRIETARY INTERNATIONAL CARD BUSINESS

THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF MORE THAN 80 NEW OR ENHANCED CARD PRODUCTS DURING 2003.

THESE ARE CARDS THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS ISSUES, EITHER ON ITS OWN OR COBRANDED

WITH PARTNERING INSTITUTIONS. THEY INCLUDED CENTURION CARDS IN MEXICO AND JAPAN,

THE INTERNATIONAL DOLLAR PLATINUM CARD IN 43 LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN

MARKETS, AND SEVERAL GOLD CARD PRODUCTS IN MARKETS INCLUDING INDIA, JAPAN AND

INDONESIA, AS WELL AS CARDS WITH PREMIER PARTNERS LIKE HOLT RENFREW IN CANADA,

BMW IN AUSTRALIA AND E-PLUS IN GERMANY.

TRS ISSUES CARDS UNDER COBRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS

BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. EXAMPLES OF TRS' COBRAND

ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIAN AIRLINES, KLM, HOLT RENFREW,

AEROPLAN, A SUBSIDIARY OF AIR CANADA, PENINSULA HOTEL (HONG KONG), AEROMEXICO,

AIR FRANCE, LOYALTY MANAGEMENT GROUP CANADA, INC. (AIR MILES'R'*), ALITALIA,

DELTA AIR LINES, BRITISH AIRWAYS, COSTCO, HILTON HOTELS, SHOP RITE SUPERMARKETS,

SINGAPORE AIRLINES AND STARWOOD HOTELS AND RESORTS. THE DURATION OF SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGE FROM FIVE TO TEN YEARS. CARDMEMBERS EARN REWARDS

PROVIDED BY THE COMMERCIAL FIRMS' RESPECTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR

SPENDING ON THE COBRAND CARDS, SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY

POINTS AND REBATES. TRS MAKES PAYMENTS TO ITS COBRAND PARTNERS BASED PRIMARILY

ON THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH

SPENDING, AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED

AND RETAINED. TRS EXPENSES AMOUNTS DUE UNDER COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MONTH

EARNED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. ONCE

TRS MAKES PAYMENT TO THE COBRAND PARTNER, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PARTNER IS

SOLELY LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE

COBRAND PARTNER'S OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM.

11

THE COMPANY ALSO ISSUES CARDS UNDER DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS,

PRIMARILY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SUCH BANK DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS INVOLVE

THE OFFERING OF A STANDARD COMPANY PRODUCT (ISSUED BY TRS OR ONE OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES) TO CUSTOMERS OF THE BANK, GENERALLY WITH THE BANK'S LOGO ON THE

CARD. IN A BANK DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANY MAKES PAYMENTS TO THE BANK

PARTNERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND

RETAINED THROUGH THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON SUCH

CARDS. THE DURATION OF SUCH ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGE FROM FIVE TO SEVEN

YEARS. DURING 2003, NEW DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WERE SIGNED WITH MEESPIERSON

ASIA LIMITED IN HONG KONG, PHILLIPS SECURITIES IN SINGAPORE AND ING COMERCIAL

AMERICA IN MEXICO.

IN ADDITION TO THE PAYMENTS TO COBRAND AND BANK PARTNERS REFERRED TO ABOVE,

THE ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH ENTITIES MAY CONTAIN OTHER TERMS UNIQUE TO THE

ARRANGEMENT WITH THE PARTNER, INCLUDING AN OBLIGATION ON THE PART OF TRS TO MAKE

PAYMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

MANY TRS CARDMEMBERS, PARTICULARLY CHARGE CARD HOLDERS, ARE CHARGED AN

ANNUAL FEE THAT VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD, THE NUMBER OF CARDS FOR EACH

ACCOUNT, THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THE CARD IS DENOMINATED AND THE COUNTRY OF

RESIDENCE OF THE CARDMEMBER. MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS ARE OFFERED WITH NO

ANNUAL FEE. EACH CARDMEMBER MUST MEET STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR

CREDITWORTHINESS THAT ARE APPLIED THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS BOTH AT THE TIME OF

INITIAL SOLICITATION OR APPLICATION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING THE CARD

RELATIONSHIP. THE COMPANY USES SOPHISTICATED CREDIT MODELS AND TECHNIQUES IN ITS

RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS AND BELIEVES THAT ITS STRONG RISK MANAGEMENT

CAPABILITIES PROVIDE IT WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

SEVERAL PRODUCTS LAUNCHED OR RENEWED BY TRS IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE

LAST FEW YEARS CONTINUED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS RESULTS IN

2003, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' REWARDS GREEN AND AMERICAN EXPRESS'R'

REWARDS GOLD CARDS FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THESE CARDS OFFER AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT IN

THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM AND DOUBLE POINTS FOR PURCHASES AT SUPERMARKETS,

GAS STATIONS, DRUGSTORES, AND OTHER EVERYDAY SPEND LOCATIONS. REWARDS-BASED

PRODUCTS NOT ONLY DRIVE HIGHER SPENDING, THEY ALSO HAVE VERY FAVORABLE ECONOMICS

IN TERMS OF CARDMEMBER ATTRITION, CREDIT AND PAYMENT PERFORMANCE. THESE CARDS

PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS WITH ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES TO EARN REWARDS AND SUPPORT TRS'

EFFORTS TO DRIVE SPENDING AT EVERYDAY SPEND LOCATIONS. EARLY IN 2003, TRS

INTRODUCED BLUE CASH FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS FOR U.S. CONSUMERS. THIS CARD, WHICH

IS IN LARGE PART REPLACING THE COMPANY'S CASH REBATE CARD IN THE UNITED STATES,

CARRIES NO ANNUAL FEE AND OFFERS UP TO FIVE PERCENT CASH BACK ON CERTAIN TYPES

OF SPENDING, BASED ON A CARDMEMBER'S ANNUAL SPENDING AND PAYMENT ACTIVITY.

DURING 2003, TRS ALSO CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS U.S. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM - THE LARGEST PROGRAM OF ITS KIND. TRS CONTINUED TO ADD NEW MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PARTNERS IN A RANGE OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING ELIZABETH ARDEN RED DOOR

SALONS, HYATT HOTELS AND RESORTS, TELECHARGE.COM, SEAWORLD AND BUSCH GARDENS

ADVENTURE PARKS, FORTUNOFF AND ESCADA. TRS ALSO INTRODUCED A NEW OFFERING CALLED

YOUR REWARD'R' THAT ALLOWS ENROLLEES TO CREATE THEIR OWN UNIQUE REDEMPTION

PACKAGES, AS WELL AS TO SELECT FROM A DIVERSE MENU OF READY-MADE ADVENTURES AND

EXPERIENCES. TRS' MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER

OF

12

CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND LOYALTY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES, BASED ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE, THAT CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS AND CO-BRAND PROGRAMS YIELD

HIGHER SPEND, BETTER RETENTION, STRONGER CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND GREATER PROFIT

FOR THE COMPANY.

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, REWARDS ARE A STRONG DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING

IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER BUSINESS. IN 2003, TRS CONTINUED TO ENHANCE ITS

REWARDS PROGRAMS IN SEVERAL MARKETS, OFFERING RICHER AND MORE FLEXIBLE CHOICES

THAT ENABLE CARDMEMBERS TO EARN POINTS MORE QUICKLY, INCLUDING THE LAUNCH IN NEW

ZEALAND OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS PLATINUM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS'SM' CREDIT CARD

AND THE REWARDS MAXIMISER CARD IN AUSTRALIA. TRS ALSO INTRODUCED A REWARDS

"ACCELERATOR" PROGRAM IN TEN MARKETS THAT DRIVES SPENDING BY ENABLING

CARDMEMBERS TO EARN POINTS FASTER.

WHEN A CARDMEMBER ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM USES THE CARD,

TRS ESTABLISHES RESERVES IN CONNECTION WITH ESTIMATED FUTURE REWARD REDEMPTIONS.

WHEN A MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ENROLLEE REDEEMS A REWARD USING THE MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM POINTS, TRS MAKES A PAYMENT TO THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM

PARTNER PROVIDING THE REWARD PURSUANT TO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. DUE TO HIGHER

CHARGE VOLUMES AND GREATER PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AND PENETRATION, THE EXPENSE OF

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS HAS INCREASED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND CONTINUES TO

GROW. BY OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES, TRS HAS IMPROVED

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. TRS CONTINUALLY SEEKS

WAYS TO CONTAIN THE OVERALL COST OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS

VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS.

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, CARDMEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF FREE AND

FEE-BASED SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CARD THEY HAVE

AND THEIR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE. THESE INCLUDE THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM,

GLOBAL ASSIST'R' HOTLINE, BUYER'S ASSURANCE PLAN, CAR RENTAL LOSS AND DAMAGE

INSURANCE, TRAVEL ACCIDENT INSURANCE, PURCHASE PROTECTION PLAN, BEST VALUE

GUARANTEE, EMERGENCY CARD REPLACEMENT, EMERGENCY CHECK CASHING PRIVILEGES,

AUTOMATIC FLIGHT INSURANCE, PREMIUM BAGGAGE PROTECTION, ASSURED RESERVATIONS,

ONLINE FRAUD PROTECTION GUARANTEE, CREDIT CARD REGISTRY, CREDIT BUREAU

MONITORING AND CREDIT INSURANCE SERVICES. CERTAIN CARDS PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS WITH

ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL SERVICES, SUCH AS A YEAR-END SUMMARY OF CHARGES REPORT.

THE PLATINUM CARD, A CHARGE CARD OFFERED TO CONSUMERS IN THE UNITED STATES

AND IN VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH TRS ISSUES CARDS, PROVIDES ACCESS

TO ADDITIONAL AND ENHANCED TRAVEL, FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, PERSONAL ASSISTANCE AND

OTHER SERVICES. THE CENTURION CARD, WHICH IS OFFERED BY INVITATION TO CONSUMERS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND FIVE OTHER COUNTRIES, IS AN ULTRA-PREMIUM CHARGE CARD

PROVIDING HIGHLY PERSONALIZED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AN ARRAY OF TRAVEL, LIFESTYLE

AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS. PERSONAL, GOLD, PLATINUM AND CENTURION CARDMEMBERS

RECEIVE THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP STATEMENT, WHICH IS USED TO COMMUNICATE

SPECIAL OFFERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF BOTH MERCHANTS AND THE COMPANY.

OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, TRS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF

SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT TRS' CARD PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF

BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN RECENT YEARS, TRS HAS

FOCUSED ITS EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE USE OF

13

ITS CARDS FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 65% OF ALL OF TRS' U.S. BILLINGS CAME

FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 35% CAME FROM RETAIL AND OTHER

SECTORS. BY 2003, THAT PROPORTION WAS REVERSED, WITH RETAIL AND NON-TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 65% OF

THE BUSINESS BILLED ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. THIS SHIFT RESULTED FROM THE

GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS WHO BEGAN TO ACCEPT CHARGE AND

CREDIT CARDS IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' INCREASED DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR

MORE OF THEIR PURCHASES, AND TRS' FOCUS ON EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO EXPLOIT

THESE OPPORTUNITIES. IN RECENT YEARS, THIS SHIFT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF A

DECREASE IN SPENDING IN TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT RESULTING FROM THE OVERALL

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.

TRS CONTINUES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES

AND INTERNATIONALLY, IN ITS CARD PROCESSING SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW

FASTER INTRODUCTION AND GREATER CUSTOMIZATION OF PRODUCTS. TRS ALSO IS USING

TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE ITS SERVICE CAPABILITIES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE

TO DELIVER A HIGH QUALITY CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, TRS MAINTAINS A

SERVICE DELIVERY PLATFORM THAT ITS EMPLOYEES USE IN THE CARD BUSINESS TO SUPPORT

A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER SERVICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS

ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE, UPDATING OF CARDMEMBER INFORMATION, THE ADDITION OF NEW

CARDS TO AN ACCOUNT AND RESOLVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ISSUES. IN INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS, TRS IS BUILDING FLEXIBILITY AND ENHANCING ITS GLOBAL PLATFORMS AND

CAPABILITIES IN REVOLVING CREDIT, ITS FULL SERVICE BANKING PLATFORM CALLED

IWEALTHVIEW, AND CONSUMER PAYMENT OPTIONS. SEE "CORPORATE AND OTHER" FOR A

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY'S ARRANGEMENT REGARDING THE OUTSOURCING OF MANY OF

ITS TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS TO IBM.

THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO LEVERAGE THE INTERNET TO LOWER COSTS AND IMPROVE

SERVICE QUALITY. DURING 2003, IT EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF SERVICES AND

CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS ONLINE AND INCREASED THEIR UTILIZATION. FOR

EXAMPLE, WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 86% OF THE COMPANY'S CARD

SERVICING CALL VOLUME CAN NOW BE HANDLED ONLINE. THE COMPANY NOW HAS MORE ONLINE

INTERACTIONS WITH U.S. CUSTOMERS THAN IT DOES BY TELEPHONE OR IN PERSON. ONLINE

CARD SALES GREW STEADILY IN 2003 AS WELL.

AT YEAR-END, APPROXIMATELY TWELVE MILLION CARDS WERE ENROLLED IN "MANAGE

YOUR CARD ACCOUNT SERVICE". THIS SERVICE ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO REVIEW AND PAY

THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS BILLS ELECTRONICALLY, VIEW AND SERVICE THEIR MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM ACCOUNTS AND CONDUCT VARIOUS OTHER FUNCTIONS QUICKLY AND

SECURELY ONLINE. THE COMPANY NOW HAS AN ONLINE PRESENCE IN 55 MARKETS.

IN ADDITION TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER CARD BUSINESSES, TRS IS

ALSO A LEADING PROVIDER OF FINANCIAL AND TRAVEL SERVICES TO SMALL BUSINESSES

(FIRMS THAT GENERALLY HAVE LESS THAN 100 EMPLOYEES AND/OR SALES OF $10 MILLION

OR LESS), A KEY GROWTH AREA IN THE UNITED STATES. OPEN: THE SMALL BUSINESS

NETWORK'SM' FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS ("OPEN NETWORK") OFFERS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

A WIDE RANGE OF TOOLS, SERVICES AND SAVINGS DESIGNED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS,

INCLUDING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS, ACCESS TO WORKING CAPITAL, EXPENSE MANAGEMENT

REPORTING, ENHANCED ONLINE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES AND SAVINGS ON

BUSINESS SERVICES FROM OPEN NETWORK PARTNERS.

DURING 2003, TRS CONTINUED TO EXPAND THE OPEN NETWORK BREADTH OF PRODUCTS

AND

14

SERVICES, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BUSINESS CASH REBATE CREDIT CARD AND

THE PLATINUM BUSINESS CREDIT CARD. TRS ALSO EXPANDED ITS ABILITY TO OFFER

LINE-OF-CREDIT PRODUCTS TO U.S. SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGH SBA EXPRESS, AN

INNOVATIVE FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAM THAT ENABLES TRS TO OFFER LINES OF CREDIT BACKED

BY THE U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. DURING 2003, TRS INTRODUCED ONLINE

EXPENSE MANAGEMENT REPORTS, AN ONLINE TOOL THAT HELPS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

TRACK AND MANAGE THEIR BUSINESS EXPENSES, AND ONLINE UPGRADES, WHICH PROVIDES

CARDMEMBERS A QUICK AND CONVENIENT NEW WAY TO UPGRADE THEIR ACCOUNTS. THE OPEN

NETWORK ALSO PROVIDES SMALL BUSINESS CARDMEMBERS WITH THE BENEFITS OF ITS

EVERYDAY SAVINGS PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES SAVINGS TO CARDMEMBERS WHEN THEY USE

THEIR CARDS TO MAKE PURCHASES AT PROGRAM PARTNERS. EVERYDAY SAVINGS PARTNERS ARE

LEADERS IN CATEGORIES RELEVANT TO BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CAR RENTAL, DOCUMENT

REPRODUCTION, OFFICE SUPPLIES, SHIPPING AND WIRELESS PHONES.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CONSUMER TRAVEL NETWORK PROVIDES TRAVEL, FINANCIAL AND

CARDMEMBER SERVICES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS-OWNED TRAVEL SERVICE

OFFICES, CALL CENTERS AND PARTICIPATING AMERICAN EXPRESS REPRESENTATIVES

(INDEPENDENTLY-OWNED TRAVEL AGENCY LOCATIONS). CONSUMER TRAVEL'S VISION AND

STRATEGY IS TO BE THE PREMIUM TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDER OF CHOICE TO AMERICAN

EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS. CONSUMER TRAVEL MARKETS UNIQUE TRAVEL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CARD TO PROVIDE AN END-TO-END EXPERIENCE. U.S. CONSUMER

TRAVEL HAS DISTINGUISHED ITSELF IN THE LUXURY MARKETPLACE THROUGH ITS PLATINUM

TRAVEL SERVICES AND CENTURION TRAVEL SERVICES, WHICH PROVIDE PROGRAMS SUCH AS

THE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE PROGRAM, WHICH OFFERS TWO-FOR-ONE FARES ON

INTERNATIONAL FIRST AND BUSINESS CLASS TICKETS, AND THE FINE HOTELS & RESORTS

PROGRAM, A LUXURY HOTEL PROGRAM OFFERING ROOM UPGRADES AND VALUE-ADDED

AMENITIES.

IN ADDITION, THE CONSUMER TRAVEL BUSINESS OPERATES A WHOLESALE TRAVEL

BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH PACKAGES AMERICAN EXPRESS VACATIONS AND

DISTRIBUTES TRAVEL PACKAGES THROUGH OTHER RETAIL TRAVEL AGENTS, AND A CRUISE

SUBSIDIARY IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH MARKETS VALUE-ADDED CRUISE PRODUCTS

CALLED THE MARINER'S CLUB. CONSUMER TRAVEL ALSO PROVIDES MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM CRUISE AND TOUR FULFILLMENT, FEE-FREE TRAVELER'S CHEQUES, AND FOREIGN

EXCHANGE.

TRS' WORLDWIDE TRAVEL NETWORK OF MORE THAN 1,700 RETAIL TRAVEL LOCATIONS IS

IMPORTANT IN SUPPORTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND PROVIDING CUSTOMER

SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

TRS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WITH

RESPECT TO THE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. AS A CARD ISSUER, TRS COMPETES IN THE

UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIBANK, BANK ONE AND

JPMORGAN CHASE (WHICH ANNOUNCED THEIR PLANS TO MERGE), MBNA, AND CAPITAL ONE

FINANCIAL) THAT ARE MEMBERS OF VISA AND/OR MASTERCARD AND THAT ISSUE GENERAL

PURPOSE CARDS, PRIMARILY UNDER REVOLVING CREDIT PLANS, ON ONE OR BOTH OF THOSE

SYSTEMS, AND THE MORGAN STANLEY AFFILIATE THAT ISSUES THE DISCOVER CARD ON THE

DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES NETWORK. INTERNATIONALLY, TRS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

COMPETITION FROM MULTINATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS CITIBANK, HSBC AND BANCO

SANTANDER, AS WELL AS MANY LOCAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. TRS ALSO

ENCOUNTERS LIMITED COMPETITION FROM BUSINESSES THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR

OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND AIRLINE

ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS ARE NOT GENERALLY SUBSTITUTES FOR TRS' CARDS

BECAUSE OF THEIR LIMITED ACCEPTANCE. AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS

AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT

15

CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER

NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS AND THE LARGEST ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW

USING THEIR GREATER RESOURCES, ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND BRAND RECOGNITION TO

COMPETE.

COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT

CARDHOLDERS INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT,

AIRLINE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS AND OTHER REWARD OR REBATE

PROGRAMS, "TEASER" PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CREDIT CARD ACQUISITION

AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND COBRANDED ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER

BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS. TARGET CUSTOMERS ARE SEGMENTED BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS

FINANCIAL NEEDS AND PREFERENCES, BRAND LOYALTY, INTEREST IN REWARDS PROGRAMS AND

CREDITWORTHINESS, AND SPECIFIC PRODUCTS ARE TAILORED TO SPECIFIC CUSTOMER

SEGMENTS.

MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ALSO ISSUE

DEBIT CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR

POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED

ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE VISA OR MASTERCARD

LOGO. AS A RESULT, THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE

UNITED STATES HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AND, IN THE UNITED STATES,

HAS GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS. DEBIT CARDS ARE

MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH AND CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT

CARDS ARE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS. WHILE DEBIT CARDS MAY BE USED

INSTEAD OF CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF TRANSACTIONS, THE

ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE DEBIT CARDS FOR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS IS LIMITED BECAUSE

THE CONSUMER MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN HIS OR HER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TO

COVER THE TRANSACTION IN QUESTION. FOR EXAMPLE, LARGER PURCHASES OR DELAYED

PURCHASES MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR DEBIT CARDS. TRS DOES NOT CURRENTLY ISSUE

POINT-OF-SALE DEBIT CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT NETWORK.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS ARE

(I) THE FEATURES AND THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING REWARDS

PROGRAMS PROVIDED TO CARDMEMBERS; (II) THE NUMBER, SPENDING CHARACTERISTICS AND

CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF CARDMEMBERS; (III) THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE

ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT A CARD; (IV) THE COST OF CARDS TO CARDMEMBERS; (V)

THE TERMS OF PAYMENT AVAILABLE TO CARDMEMBERS; (VI) THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF

OTHER PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO CARDMEMBERS; (VII) THE NATURE AND QUALITY

OF EXPENSE MANAGEMENT DATA CAPTURE AND REPORTING CAPABILITY; (VIII) THE SUCCESS

OF TARGETED MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; (IX) REPUTATION AND BRAND

RECOGNITION; (X) THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS TO IMPLEMENT OPERATIONAL AND COST

EFFICIENCIES; AND (XI) THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TRS,

ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES ("CREDCO"), PURCHASES THE MAJORITY OF CHARGE CARD

RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE USE OF CARDS ISSUED IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN

DESIGNATED CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO FINANCES THE PURCHASE OF

RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE SALE OF

MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK FINANCES ITS REVOLVING CREDIT

RECEIVABLES THROUGH THE SALE OF SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND CERTIFICATES OF

DEPOSIT IN THE UNITED STATES. TRS AND CENTURION BANK ALSO FUND RECEIVABLES

THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE GAINS FROM ITS

SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES TO HELP FUND CERTAIN MARKETING AND PROMOTION

ACTIVITIES. THE COST OF FUNDING CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR

EXPENSE OF CARD OPERATIONS. (FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF TRS' AND CENTURION

BANK'S

16

SECURITIZATION AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SEE PAGE 27, PAGES 37 THROUGH 38,

PAGE 43, PAGES 44 THROUGH 47 AND PAGES 53 THROUGH 57 UNDER THE CAPTION

"FINANCIAL REVIEW," AND NOTE 4 ON PAGES 88 THROUGH 90 OF THE COMPANY'S 2003

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS OF SUCH REPORT ARE INCORPORATED

HEREIN BY REFERENCE.)

CENTURION BANK'S DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

CORPORATION ("FDIC") FOR UP TO $100,000 PER DEPOSITOR. CENTURION BANK IS A

UTAH-CHARTERED INDUSTRIAL LOAN COMPANY REGULATED, SUPERVISED AND REGULARLY

EXAMINED BY THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE FDIC. AMONG

THE ACTIVITIES OF CENTURION BANK THAT ARE REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ARE ITS

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN STEPS TO

MAINTAIN A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE STANDARDS. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING INITIATIVES AFFECTING THE COMPANY, SEE

"CORPORATE AND OTHER" BELOW. CENTURION BANK IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL

ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS PROMULGATED BY THE FDIC. UNDER THESE REGULATIONS, A BANK

IS DEEMED TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED IF IT MAINTAINS A TIER ONE RISK-BASED CAPITAL

RATIO OF AT LEAST 6%, A TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10%, AND A

LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, AECB MET THE "WELL

CAPITALIZED" STANDARD, WITH A TIER ONE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF 9.00%, A

TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF 10.33%, AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF 11.55%.

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB ("AEBFSB") IS A FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK REGULATED

AND SUPERVISED BY THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION ("OTS"). IN DECEMBER 2003,

AEBFSB AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES RECEIVED OTS APPROVAL TO, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF THE FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK FROM AEFA TO TRS,

RELOCATE ITS HEADQUARTERS FROM MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA TO WEST VALLEY, UTAH, AND

AMEND ITS BUSINESS PLAN TO PERMIT AEBFSB TO OFFER CERTAIN CREDIT, CHARGE AND

CONSUMER LENDING PRODUCTS, SMALL BUSINESS LOANS, MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED

PRODUCTS AND TO OPERATE A TRANSACTIONAL INTERNET SITE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

CHANGES TO AEBFSB'S BUSINESS PLAN, WHICH WILL PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE

COMPANY, BEGAN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 WITH THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN CARD

ACCOUNTS FROM CENTURION BANK TO AEBFSB. AEBFSB CONTINUES TO PROVIDE PERSONAL

TRUST, CUSTODIAL, AGENCY AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO INDIVIDUAL

CLIENTS OF AEFA. AEBFSB IS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER.

AEBFSB IS AUTHORIZED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN ALL 50 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA, AND UTILIZES AEFA AS ITS PRIMARY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL FOR THESE

SERVICES.

THE CHARGE CARD, ATM AND CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (WHICH GENERALLY

PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION IN THE GRANTING AND HANDLING OF CREDIT); THE FAIR

CREDIT REPORTING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATES USE BY CREDITORS OF

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS AND CREDIT PRESCREENING PRACTICES AND REQUIRES CERTAIN

DISCLOSURES WHEN AN APPLICATION FOR CREDIT IS REJECTED); THE TRUTH IN LENDING

ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS UPON

WHICH CREDIT IS GRANTED); THE FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT (WHICH, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, REGULATES THE MANNER THAT BILLING INQUIRIES ARE HANDLED AND SPECIFIES

CERTAIN BILLING REQUIREMENTS); THE FAIR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD DISCLOSURE ACT

(WHICH MANDATES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ON CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD APPLICATIONS); AND

THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACT (WHICH REGULATES DISCLOSURES AND SETTLEMENT OF

TRANSACTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS INCLUDING THOSE AT ATMS). CERTAIN

FEDERAL PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERN

17

THE COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SEE

"CORPORATE AND OTHER" BELOW). FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT

COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND

MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER

CREDIT PROTECTION, DISCLOSURE AND PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE

STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES). THE APPLICATION OF BANKRUPTCY

AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS AFFECT THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS RESULT

IN AMOUNTS OWED BEING CLASSIFIED AS DELINQUENT AND/OR CHARGED OFF AS

UNCOLLECTIBLE. CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING AND ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION, INCLUDING, IN THE UNITED STATES,

THE USA PATRIOT ACT. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS LEGISLATION AND ITS EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY'S BUSINESS SEE "CORPORATE AND OTHER" BELOW.) CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB

AND THE COMPANY'S OTHER BANK ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS OR IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THEREOF

COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS AND THE COSTS

OF COMPLIANCE. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S CARD AND

LENDING BUSINESSES OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASING COMPLEX AND ROBUST. THE

COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REFINES ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES

IN LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND

INDUSTRY TRENDS SO THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND

CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL

(THE "FFIEC"), AN INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL

ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED IN FINAL

FORM ITS GUIDANCE ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES

(THE "GUIDANCE"). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE AREAS: (I) CREDIT LINE MANAGEMENT,

(II) OVER-LIMIT PRACTICES, (III) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION

PRACTICES, (IV) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES, AND (V) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE)

RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES. THE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE

TO ALL INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY

AGENCIES THAT COMPRISE THE FFIEC, ALTHOUGH IT IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE

IDENTIFICATION BY BANK REGULATORS IN THEIR EXAMINATIONS OF OTHER CREDIT CARD

LENDERS PRACTICES DEEMED BY THEM TO BE INAPPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY, BUT NOT

EXCLUSIVELY, WITH REGARD TO SUBPRIME LENDING PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE

ANY LENDING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE SUBPRIME MARKET. THE GUIDANCE HAS NOT HAD

ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES AND THE COMPANY

DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS

PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE, NOR DOES THE GUIDANCE MANDATE ANY CHANGES TO THE

COMPANY'S PRACTICES.

GLOBAL CORPORATE SERVICES

TRS' GLOBAL CORPORATE SERVICES BUSINESS ("GCS") HELPS COMPANIES AROUND THE

WORLD BETTER MANAGE THE COSTS AND PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH A RANGE OF EXPENSES,

INCLUDING TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT AND EVERYDAY BUSINESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

GCS OFFERS THREE PRIMARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES: CORPORATE CARD, ISSUED TO

INDIVIDUALS THROUGH A CORPORATE ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY THEIR EMPLOYER AND

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING; CORPORATE PURCHASING

SOLUTIONS, AN ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY A COMPANY TO PAY FOR EVERYDAY BUSINESS

EXPENSES SUCH AS OFFICE AND COMPUTER SUPPLIES; AND CORPORATE TRAVEL, A LARGE

CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENCY, WHICH HELPS BUSINESSES MANAGE THEIR TRAVEL EXPENSES

THROUGH A VARIETY OF TRAVEL-RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

18

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' CORPORATE CARD IS A CHARGE CARD ISSUED TO

INDIVIDUALS THROUGH A CORPORATE ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED BY THEIR EMPLOYER FOR

BUSINESS PURPOSES. THROUGH THE CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM, COMPANIES CAN MONITOR

TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES AND IMPROVE NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE WITH

SUPPLIERS, AMONG OTHER BENEFITS. AMERICAN EXPRESS USES ITS DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS

WITH MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT THE CARD TO OFFER CORPORATE CARD CLIENTS SUPERIOR

DATA ABOUT COMPANY SPENDING, AS WELL AS STREAMLINED DISPUTE RESOLUTION. AMERICAN

EXPRESS ISSUES LOCAL CURRENCY CORPORATE CARDS IN 37 COUNTRIES (BOTH THROUGH

PROPRIETARY OPERATIONS AND PARTNER BANKS), AND INTERNATIONAL DOLLAR CORPORATE

CARDS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS ("CPS") PROVIDES LARGE AND MIDDLE MARKET

COMPANIES WITH TOOLS TO BETTER MANAGE THEIR EVERYDAY SPENDING. CPS IS USED BY

CORPORATIONS TO BUY EVERYDAY GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES AND

INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT, IN 24 MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS TYPE OF

SPENDING BY CORPORATIONS IS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS THAN

TRADITIONAL TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING AND HELPS TO DIVERSIFY THE

SPENDING MIX ON THE COMPANY'S CARDS.

GCS IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO GLOBAL,

MULTINATIONAL AND LARGE BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE. GCS ESTABLISHED THE GLOBAL

BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS GROUP WHICH SERVES A HIGHLY SELECT GROUP OF FORTUNE 100

COMPANIES THAT HAVE GLOBALIZED THEIR APPROACH TO TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT

EXPENSE MANAGEMENT AND HAVE STRUCTURED THEIR PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS IN A GLOBAL

MANNER TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND OPTIMIZE THEIR INVESTMENTS IN TRAVEL AND

ENTERTAINMENT, AS WELL AS EVERYDAY CORPORATE EXPENSES.

IN ADDITION, GCS PROVIDES CORPORATE CARD AND TRAVEL EXPENSE MANAGEMENT

SERVICES TO MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES (DEFINED IN THE UNITED STATES AS FIRMS WITH

ANNUAL REVENUES OF $10 MILLION TO $1 BILLION) IN MATURE ECONOMIES WORLDWIDE,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, SWEDEN,

GERMANY, AUSTRALIA, SINGAPORE AND MEXICO. GCS IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO EXPAND

ITS BUSINESS WITH MIDSIZE COMPANIES AND BELIEVES THIS MARKET OFFERS A STRONG

GROWTH OPPORTUNITY, AS IT ENCOMPASSES A SEGMENT OF CUSTOMERS THAT TYPICALLY DO

NOT HAVE CORPORATE CARD PROGRAMS. IN 2003, GCS INVESTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF

MARKETING PROGRAMS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS, AND ADDED SALES STAFF TO GENERATE

MORE CARD AND TRAVEL BUSINESS WITH MIDSIZE FIRMS. TO ENHANCE THE CARD PRODUCT

FOR MIDSIZE AND CERTAIN LARGE MARKET FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES, IN 2003 GCS

EXPANDED ITS SAVINGS AT WORK'SM' PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES COMPANIES WITH

DISCOUNTS ON EVERYDAY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES, AND A

RANGE OF BUSINESS SERVICES.

DURING 2003, GCS ADDED SEVERAL MAJOR CLIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND

INTERNATIONALLY FOR THE CORPORATE CARD, INCLUDING ORACLE, MERRILL LYNCH, SONY

CORPORATION OF AMERICA AND BEARINGPOINT. RAYTHEON AND NOVARTIS BECAME CPS

CLIENTS DURING THE YEAR.

IN 2003, TRS ANNOUNCED A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES IN THE U.S.

CORPORATE CARD BUSINESS. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BUSINESS EXTRAA CORPORATE CARD, A

COBRANDED CARD FOR MIDSIZE AND CERTAIN LARGE MARKET COMPANIES, DELIVERS SAVINGS

IN THE FORM OF CASH REBATES ON A COMPANY'S AIRLINE SPENDING, AS WELL AS BONUS

POINTS AND DISCOUNTS ON EVERYDAY BUSINESS SPENDING. THE NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH

AMERICAN AIRLINES ADDS A NEW LEVEL OF PREMIUM VALUE TO

19

TRS' CORPORATE CARD PORTFOLIO, PROVIDING A GROWTH OPPORTUNITY IN ATTRACTING

AND CULTIVATING THE LOYALTY OF MIDSIZE COMPANIES. TRS ALSO ANNOUNCED SIMILAR

COBRAND ISSUING ARRANGEMENTS WITH QANTAS AIRWAYS, KLM ROYAL DUTCH AIRLINES AND

AEROPLAN, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AIR CANADA.

WITH THE INCREASED FOCUS ON COST CONTAINMENT BY FIRMS, GCS HAS SEEN

SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN THE CORPORATE MEETING CARD, WHICH

HELPS U.S.-BASED COMPANIES CONTROL COMPANY MEETING EXPENSES. THE CORPORATE

MEETING CARD PROVIDES CLIENTS WITH A TOOL TO CAPTURE SUCH SPENDING AND PROVIDES

COMPANY MEETING PLANNERS WITH A TOOL TO SIMPLIFY THE MEETINGS PAYMENT PROCESS

AND ACCESS TO DATA TO NEGOTIATE WITH SUPPLIERS. GCS ALSO LAUNCHED THE CORPORATE

DEFINED EXPENSE PROGRAM IN 2003. THIS PRODUCT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO SET A MAXIMUM

AMOUNT TO BE CHARGED ON A CARD BEFORE EXPIRATION AND PERMITS THEM TO SEGREGATE

SPENDING DATA FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES ON PROJECTS. IT IS DESIGNED FOR COMPANIES

THAT WANT TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE RELOCATIONS

OR TRAINING.

IN 2003, GCS EXPANDED SALES OF AMERICAN EXPRESS @ WORK'R', A SECURE,

WEB-BASED SUITE OF ONLINE TOOLS THAT ENABLES CORPORATE CARD, CPS AND CORPORATE

TRAVEL CUSTOMERS TO PERFORM ACCOUNT REVIEW AND SERVICING AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT

REPORTS ON A 24/7 BASIS THROUGH A SINGLE USER INTERFACE. THIS SUITE HELPS

COMPANIES MANAGE EXPENSES AND MANIPULATE SPEND DATA MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN

OFFLINE ALTERNATIVES, WHILE DECREASING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICING.

THESE PRODUCTS ENABLE COMPANIES TO REVIEW, COMBINE AND MANIPULATE CORPORATE

CARD, CORPORATE TRAVEL AND CORPORATE PURCHASING SOLUTIONS DATA. ONE OF THE

PRODUCTS ALSO ALLOWS COMPANIES TO RECONCILE THE DATA WITH ITS INTERNAL

ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.

COMPETITION IN THE COMMERCIAL CARD (CORPORATE CARD AND CPS) BUSINESS IS

INCREASINGLY INTENSE AT BOTH THE CARD NETWORK AND CARD ISSUER LEVELS. AT THE

NETWORK LEVEL, DINERS CLUB REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL COMPETITOR. IN ADDITION,

BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE INCREASED EFFORTS TO SUPPORT CARD ISSUERS SUCH AS

U.S. BANK, JPMORGAN CHASE, GE CAPITAL FINANCIAL INC. AND CITIBANK (IN THE UNITED

STATES AND GLOBALLY), WHO ARE WILLING TO BUILD AND SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION AND

REPORTING NECESSARY TO SATISFY CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS,

MASTERCARD HAS PROMOTED ENHANCED WEB-BASED SUPPORT FOR ITS CORPORATE CARD

ISSUING MEMBERS, AND VISA INTERNATIONAL SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF A JOINT

VENTURE BY A NUMBER OF ITS MEMBER BANKS FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO COMPETE AGAINST

GCS AND DINERS CLUB FOR THE BUSINESS OF MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES. THE KEY

COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS ARE, IN ADDITION TO THE

FACTORS CITED ON PAGE 16, (I) THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE AND DELIVER DETAILED

TRANSACTION DATA AND EXPENSE MANAGEMENT REPORTS; (II) THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF

BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARDS; (III) PRICING; (IV) THE RANGE AND

INNOVATIVENESS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO SUIT BUSINESS NEEDS; (V) QUALITY OF

CUSTOMER SERVICES; AND (VI) GLOBAL PRESENCE.

GCS ALSO PROVIDES A WIDE VARIETY OF TRAVEL SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS TRAVELING

FOR BUSINESS AND IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST CORPORATE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT

COMPANIES. AMERICAN EXPRESS CORPORATE TRAVEL PROVIDES TRAVEL RESERVATION ADVICE

AND BOOKING TRANSACTION PROCESSING; TRAVEL EXPENSE MANAGEMENT POLICY

CONSULTATION; SUPPLIER NEGOTIATION AND CONSULTATION; MANAGEMENT INFORMATION

REPORTING, DATA ANALYSIS AND BENCHMARKING; AND GROUP AND INCENTIVE TRAVEL

SERVICES. CORPORATE TRAVEL SERVICES CUSTOMERS IN 37 KEY MARKETS WORLDWIDE, OF

WHICH 31 ARE PROPRIETARY OPERATIONS AND SIX ARE MANAGED THROUGH JOINT VENTURES.

IN 2003, GCS WAS AWARDED THE CORPORATE

20

TRAVEL BUSINESS OF COMPANIES INCLUDING BEARINGPOINT, BRITISH TELECOM AND THE

FRENCH GOVERNMENT'S MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.

IN OCTOBER 2003, THE COMPANY CONTINUED PURSUING ITS GROWTH STRATEGY AND

EXPANDED ITS GLOBAL REACH BY COMPLETING THE ACQUISITION OF ROSENBLUTH

INTERNATIONAL, A CORPORATE TRAVEL COMPANY THAT WAS THE FIFTH-LARGEST TRAVEL

MANAGEMENT COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ROSENBLUTH ACQUISITION ADDED NEARLY

400 SERVICING LOCATIONS AND, AS OF YEAR-END, APPROXIMATELY 2,700 EMPLOYEES IN

THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AS WELL AS OTHER STRATEGIC

MARKETS IN EUROPE, ASIA AND THE PACIFIC RIM. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE

ROSENBLUTH ACQUISITION HELPS THE COMPANY EXPAND AN ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER

COMPETITORS AND ONLINE TRAVEL AGENCIES THAT DO NOT OFFER SIMILAR WORLDWIDE

SERVICING CAPABILITIES. THE ROSENBLUTH ACQUISITION ALSO HAS INCREASED CUSTOMER

VOLUME IN BOTH THE LARGE AND MIDDLE MARKET SEGMENTS AND WILL ENABLE THE

CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT AND SERVICES PORTFOLIO BY

INTEGRATING THE TECHNOLOGY AND CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS FROM BOTH COMPANIES.

GCS CONTINUES TO MODIFY ITS ECONOMIC MODEL AND INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES

TO ADDRESS ONGOING TRAVEL INDUSTRY CHALLENGES. FOR EXAMPLE, GCS HAS BEEN

SUCCESSFUL IN ITS EFFORTS TO DIMINISH ITS RELIANCE ON COMMISSION REVENUES FROM

SUPPLIERS, SUCH AS AIRLINES OR HOTELS, AND NOW RELIES MORE ON CUSTOMERS TO PAY

TRANSACTION OR MANAGEMENT FEES FOR ITS TRAVEL SERVICES. IN 2003, A SMALLER

PORTION OF U.S. CORPORATE TRAVEL REVENUES CAME FROM AIRLINES, HOTELS, RENTAL CAR

COMPANIES AND OTHER SUPPLIERS, AND A MAJORITY CAME FROM CUSTOMERS. A FEW YEARS

AGO, THAT MIX WAS THE REVERSE. IN ADDITION, GCS HAS MOVED MANY OF ITS BUSINESS

PROCESSES AND CUSTOMER SERVICING FOR CORPORATE TRAVEL ONLINE. KEY INITIATIVES

INCLUDED THE ACCELERATION OF THE USE OF INTERACTIVE TRAVEL PROCESSES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER KEY MARKETS, WHICH STREAMLINES PROCESSES, INCREASES

PRODUCTIVITY, ENHANCES THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SATISFACTION AND

IMPROVES OVERALL GCS PROFITABILITY. BY THE END OF 2003, IN THE UNITED STATES,

25% OF ALL OF GCS' CORPORATE TRAVEL TRANSACTIONS WERE PROCESSED ONLINE, AND

ONLINE PENETRATION RATES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, MEXICO AND AUSTRALIA

ACHIEVED LEVELS WITHIN THE 5% TO 10% RANGE.

THE CORPORATE TRAVEL DIVISION OF GCS FACES VIGOROUS COMPETITION IN THE

UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FROM NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE TRAVEL

MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL

SUPPLIERS. COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED ON

PRICE, SERVICE, CONVENIENCE, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER.

IN ADDITION, COMPETITION COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES, AS SOME

COMPANIES HAVE BECOME ACCREDITED AS IN-HOUSE CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS.

IN 2003, SEVERAL U.S.-BASED ONLINE TRAVEL AGENCIES STRATEGICALLY EXPANDED

THEIR OFFERINGS AND MARKETING EFFORTS BEYOND THEIR TRADITIONAL TARGET CUSTOMER

SET, WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN PRIMARILY THE LEISURE TRAVELER, WITH INCREASING

FOCUS ON SMALL OR MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES. ORBITZ, EXPEDIA

AND TRAVELOCITY HAVE ALL BEGUN TO PURSUE MIDSIZED AND LARGER CORPORATE TRAVEL

CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THE ONLINE AGENCIES' EFFORTS

TO PENETRATE THE MANAGED CORPORATE TRAVEL SECTOR HAS TO DATE OCCURRED IN THE

UNITED STATES, IT IS LIKELY THAT THESE EFFORTS WILL BE EXPANDED TO CANADA, THE

UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER MATURE EUROPEAN MARKETS IN 2004. COMPETITION FOR THESE

LARGER CORPORATE TRAVEL CUSTOMERS WILL INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS.

21

AIRLINES HAVE CONTINUED THEIR EFFORTS TO REDUCE DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES.

FOLLOWING THE INDUSTRY-WIDE ACTION IN MARCH 2002 WHEN U.S. AIRLINES AND SOME

INTERNATIONAL CARRIERS ANNOUNCED THEY WOULD NO LONGER PAY "BASE" COMMISSIONS TO

TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA ON ALL DOMESTIC

AND INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL, AIRLINES IN OTHER MARKETS FOLLOWED SUIT. DURING LATE

2002 AND THROUGHOUT 2003, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, SCANDINAVIA, THE NETHERLANDS,

AUSTRALIA, MEXICO, BRAZIL, AND SOME ASIA PACIFIC COUNTRIES, THE LEADING MARKET

AIRLINE HAS DISCONTINUED OR DRASTICALLY REDUCED BASE COMMISSION PAYMENTS TO

TRAVEL AGENCIES. SIMILAR ACTIONS ARE EXPECTED IN FRANCE AND GERMANY IN 2004.

THE IMPACT IN 2003 OF GLOBAL MACRO EVENTS, INCLUDING THE CONTINUED

WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, THE WAR IN IRAQ, FEAR OF TERRORISM AND OTHER

GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AND SARS, ADVERSELY IMPACTED THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY AND

CAUSED SOME TRAVEL AGENCIES TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND ENCOURAGED OTHERS TO SEEK

CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NORTH AMERICAN AIRLINES REPORTING

CORPORATION ("ARC") REPORTED 13% FEWER ARC-ACCREDITED AGENCIES OPERATING IN

NORTH AMERICA IN 2003 VERSUS THE NUMBER OF AGENCIES IN 2002.

THIS YEAR ALSO SAW THE CONTINUED RISE IN POPULARITY, RELEVANCE AND

PROFITABILITY OF THE LOW-COST AIR CARRIER SEGMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE

AND ASIA, INCLUDING THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF SEVERAL NEW LOW-COST CARRIERS, SOME

OF WHICH ARE SUBSIDIARIES OF FINANCIALLY TROUBLED U.S. "MAINLINE" CARRIERS.

WHILE THIS SEGMENT HAS FOCUSED IN THE PAST PRIMARILY ON LEISURE TRAVELERS, 2003

SAW A CONTINUED RISE IN THE NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF BUSINESS TRAVELERS USING

THESE LOW-COST AIRLINES.

UNTIL THE LAST FEW YEARS, GCS HAD RECEIVED COMMISSIONS AND FEES FOR

TICKETING AND RESERVATIONS FROM AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS, AND

MANAGEMENT AND TRANSACTION FEES FROM CORPORATE TRAVEL CUSTOMERS. THE ONGOING

TRENDS OF AIRLINE ALLIANCES, AIRLINE WEBSITES PERMITTING TRAVELERS TO BOOK

BUSINESS DIRECTLY AND ONGOING RATE REDUCTIONS IN AIRLINE COMMISSIONS CONTINUE TO

REDUCE REVENUE FOR TRAVEL COMPANIES AND RAISE COSTS FOR TRAVELERS. IN 2003, GCS

ANNOUNCED ITS TRAVELBAHN'R' DISTRIBUTION SOLUTION IN NORTH AMERICA, A

PROPRIETARY DISTRIBUTION NETWORK ALTERNATIVE THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO BEST

AIRLINE INVENTORY AND FARES FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS CORPORATE TRAVEL CUSTOMERS WITH

A NUMBER OF CARRIERS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES ITS NEGOTIATIONS WITH ADDITIONAL

AIRLINE CARRIERS TO FINALIZE SIMILAR DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS.

IN RESPONSE TO THE CHANGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND THE ACCELERATED

FLUIDITY IN AIRLINE AND HOTEL PRICING CAUSED BY UNSTEADY CAPACITY AND DEMAND,

GCS HAS CONSULTED WITH CUSTOMERS REGARDING THE GROWING NEED TO DEVELOP NEW, MORE

FLUID PURCHASING MODELS. THESE NEW MODELS ATTEMPT TO UTILIZE NEGOTIATED ANNUAL

CORPORATE FARES FOR AIRLINE AND HOTEL INVENTORY OFTEN ON SHORT NOTICE OR ON A

LAST-MINUTE BASIS. LATE IN 2003, GCS LAUNCHED THE PREFERREDEXTRAS'SM' HOTEL

PROGRAM, DESIGNED TO GUARANTEE NORTH AMERICAN CORPORATE TRAVEL CUSTOMERS THE

LOWEST AVAILABLE HOTEL RATES AT 1,400 LOCATIONS GLOBALLY AMONG A SELECT

PORTFOLIO OF PREFERRED HOTEL PARTNERS.

GCS, THROUGH ITS CONSUMER TRAVEL INTERNATIONAL AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

SERVICES GROUP ("CTI & FES"), PROVIDES LEISURE TRAVEL SERVICES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES AND RETAIL AND WHOLESALE CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES

WORLDWIDE THROUGH A GLOBAL RETAIL NETWORK OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-OWNED AND

FRANCHISED OFFICES. THE DIVISION EXPERIENCED MATERIAL

22

VOLUME DECREASES DUE TO THE WAR IN IRAQ, THE IMPACT OF THE SARS VIRUS ON GLOBAL

TRAVEL VOLUMES AND THE FEAR OF TERRORISM, ALL OF WHICH WERE PARTICULARLY

DETRIMENTAL TO LEISURE TRAVEL SPENDING.

CTI & FES EXPANDED ITS RETAIL PRESENCE IN THE AIRPORTS WITH NEW SIGNINGS AT

NEW DELHI, NEWARK AND MUNICH AIRPORTS, AND WITH CONTRACT EXPANSIONS OR

EXTENSIONS AT RIO DE JANEIRO, MEXICO CITY AND SAO PAOLO AIRPORTS. CTI & FES ALSO

PROVIDES ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER SERVICES, PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES,

CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND AUSTRALIA. THESE SERVICES OFFER SMALL AND MIDSIZE

BUSINESSES AN INTERNET-BASED SOLUTION TO TRANSFER, RECORD AND TRACK PAYMENTS TO

INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIERS AND BANKS. CTI & FES ALSO OFFERS WHOLESALE CURRENCY

SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND KEY CORPORATE CLIENTS FROM ITS

DISTRIBUTION AND PROCESSING CENTERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND AUSTRALIA.

IN RETAIL CONSUMER TRAVEL, THE GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED ITS NUMBER OF

RETAIL LOCATIONS IN AUSTRALIA AND CHINA THROUGH LARGE PARTNER FRANCHISE

AGREEMENTS IN THOSE MARKETS. MEMBERSHIP TRAVEL SERVICES ("MTS") PROVIDES CARD,

TRAVEL AND LIFESTYLE SERVICING TO THE COMPANY'S PREMIUM CARDMEMBERS, INCLUDING

GOLD, PLATINUM AND CENTURION CARDMEMBERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE

MAJORITY OF OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, ITALY, GERMANY, SPAIN,

BELGIUM, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, HONG KONG, SINGAPORE AND MEXICO. IN 2003, MTS FOCUSED

ON RATIONALIZING ITS CUSTOMER SERVICING PLATFORMS AND STANDARDIZING ITS SERVICE

DELIVERY, AS WELL AS INVESTING IN EXCLUSIVE CARDMEMBER BENEFITS FOR TRAVEL,

ENTERTAINMENT, RECREATION AND DINING OFFERS THROUGH A NETWORK OF PREFERRED

SUPPLIERS.

GLOBAL TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID SERVICES

THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS GLOBAL TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID SERVICES

GROUP ("TCPS"), IS A LEADING ISSUER OF TRAVELERS CHECKS. IN 2001, THE COMPANY

MADE THE DECISION TO STOP OFFERING MONEY ORDER AND OFFICIAL CHECK PRODUCTS AND

WILL BE FULLY EXITED FROM THIS BUSINESS BY AUGUST 2004. THE COMPANY WILL,

HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO HONOR ALL PREVIOUSLY ISSUED AND SOLD MONEY ORDERS AND

OFFICIAL CHECKS. TCPS ALSO OFFERS THE TRAVELFUNDS DIRECT'R' SERVICE, WHICH

PROVIDES DIRECT DELIVERY OF FOREIGN BANK NOTES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES IN SELECTED

MARKETS.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELERS CHEQUE ("TRAVELERS CHEQUE" OR "CHEQUE") IS

SOLD AS A SAFE AND CONVENIENT ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENCY. THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE IS A

NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT, HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE AND IS PAYABLE BY THE ISSUER IN

THE CURRENCY OF ISSUANCE WHEN PRESENTED FOR THE PURCHASE OF GOODS AND SERVICES

OR FOR REDEMPTION. DURING 2003, TCPS LAUNCHED A NEW TRAVELERS CHEQUE PRODUCT IN

RUSSIA AND ARGENTINA, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CHEQUE - SECURE FUNDS. THIS PRODUCT

OFFERS THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY AND SECURITY AS A TRAVELERS CHEQUE AND ADDRESSES

CONSUMERS' DESIRE TO KEEP EXTRA FUNDS AVAILABLE AT HOME. GIFT CHEQUES, ANOTHER

TYPE OF TRAVELERS CHECK, ARE USED FOR GIFT-GIVING PURPOSES.

TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE ISSUED IN EIGHT CURRENCIES, INCLUDING A

EURO-DENOMINATED TRAVELERS CHEQUE, BOTH DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY AND THROUGH A

JOINT VENTURE COMPANY IN WHICH THE COMPANY HOLDS AN EQUITY INTEREST. AMERICAN

EXPRESS CHEQUE - SECURE FUNDS IS ISSUED IN TWO CURRENCIES, U.S. DOLLARS AND

EUROS. GIFT CHEQUES ARE ISSUED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND CANADIAN DOLLARS.

23

AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE SOLD THROUGH A BROAD NETWORK OF

SELLING OUTLETS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING TRAVEL OFFICES OF THE COMPANY, ITS

AFFILIATES AND REPRESENTATIVES; TRAVEL AGENTS; COMMERCIAL BANKS; SAVINGS BANKS;

SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS; CREDIT UNIONS; AND OTHER FINANCIAL, TRAVEL AND

COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY SOMETIMES COMPENSATES SELLING OUTLETS FOR

THEIR SALE OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES.

ARRANGEMENTS WITH SELLERS CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL TO TCPS' EXPANSION OF ITS

SALES DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. IN 2003, TCPS GAINED A NUMBER OF NEW DISTRIBUTORS,

INCLUDING AARP IN THE UNITED STATES, TUI IN GERMANY, AEROMEXICO IN MEXICO AND

THE THOMAS COOK UK LIMITED WEBSITE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S SALE OF TRAVELERS

CHEQUES AND GIFT CHEQUES OVER THE INTERNET CONTINUED TO GROW.

TCPS HAS ALSO GROWN ITS PREPAID CARD BUSINESS. IN 2003, TCPS INTRODUCED THE

TRAVELFUNDS'SM' CARD ("TFC"), A PREPAID, RELOADABLE TRAVEL MONEY CARD. THE TFC

IS AVAILABLE IN U.S. DOLLARS, BRITISH POUNDS STERLING AND EUROS, AND CAN BE USED

WORLDWIDE AT ALL MERCHANTS AND ATMS THAT ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. THE

TFC OFFERS THE SAME CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SECURITY OF THE TRAVELERS CHEQUE,

INCLUDING PASSPORT AND CREDIT CARD REPLACEMENT ASSISTANCE. THE GROUP ALSO

CONTINUED TO EXPAND THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR PREPAID PRODUCTS WITH THE

ADDITION OF RETAIL, AIRLINE, CAR RENTAL, HOTEL AND TRAVEL AGENCY SELLERS, AS

WELL AS POSTAL SERVICES IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES. IN 2003,

TCPS ALSO CONTINUED TO OFFER TWO PREPAID GIFT PRODUCTS, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

GIFT CARD, WHICH CAN BE USED AT RETAIL AS WELL AS RESTAURANT ESTABLISHMENTS THAT

ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND THE BE MY GUEST'R' CARD, SPECIFICALLY

DESIGNED FOR RESTAURANT DINING. TCPS IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATING ADDITIONAL

PREPAID PRODUCTS TO OFFER A VARIETY OF CONSUMER SEGMENTS.

DURING THE YEAR, OVERALL TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES (INCLUDING TFC SALES)

DECREASED 13.7% GLOBALLY, AND CONSUMER GIFT PRODUCT SALES (INCLUDING SALES OF

PAPER GIFT CHEQUES AND GIFT CARDS) INCREASED 28%. GIFT CHEQUE GROWTH, WHICH IS

OFF A MUCH LOWER BASE THAN TRAVELERS CHEQUES, IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF NEW

ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS. THE LAG IN TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES WAS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUING GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, THE LOSS OF THE AAA

ACCOUNT AND BY INCREASING COMPETITION FROM OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT (INCLUDING THE

CONVENIENT ACCESS TO CASH THROUGH ATMS).

THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS ISSUED BY

TRS ARE INVESTED PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY RATED DEBT SECURITIES CONSISTING

PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS.

ISSUERS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS ARE REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER MOST

STATES' "MONEY TRANSMITTER" LAWS. SOME STATES ALSO REGULATE ISSUERS OF PREPAID

CARDS IN THE SAME MANNER. THESE LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHECK (AND, WHERE

APPLICABLE, PREPAID CARD) ISSUERS TO OBTAIN LICENSES, TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND

SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN HIGHLY RATED AND

SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. MANY STATES AUDIT LICENSEES

ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION, TRAVELERS CHECK ISSUERS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH STATE

UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS. THE U.S. STATE LAWS REQUIRE ISSUERS TO

PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY TRAVELERS CHECK THAT IS UNCASHED OR

UNREDEEMED AFTER 15 YEARS. A FEW STATES HAVE AMENDED THEIR ABANDONED PROPERTY

LAWS TO APPLY TO PREPAID CARDS. ON DECEMBER 31, 2001, NEW FEDERAL ANTI-

24

MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS BECAME EFFECTIVE. THESE REGULATIONS REQUIRED, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELER CHECK ISSUERS AS "MONEY SERVICE

BUSINESSES" AND COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING RECORDING AND REPORTING

REQUIREMENTS BY ISSUERS AND SELLING OUTLETS. AT THIS TIME, STORED VALUE ISSUERS

AND REDEEMERS, WHILE CONSIDERED TO BE "MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES", ARE NOT

REQUIRED TO REGISTER. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE VARYING ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED

STATES.

TRAVELERS CHEQUES COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT

PRODUCTS. CONSUMERS MAY CHOOSE TO USE THEIR CREDIT OR CHARGE CARDS WHEN THEY

TRAVEL INSTEAD OF CARRYING TRAVELERS CHEQUES, ALTHOUGH A TRAVELERS CHEQUE WOULD

NOT TYPICALLY BE AN ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTE FOR MOST TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH CREDIT

OR CHARGE CARDS. OTHER PAYMENT MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT SUBSTITUTE FOR TRAVELERS

CHEQUES INCLUDE CASH, CHECKS, OTHER BRANDS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, DEBIT CARDS AND

CARDS ACCEPTED AT ATM NETWORKS. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE

TRAVELERS CHECK INDUSTRY ARE (I) THE AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER OF OTHER FORMS

OF PAYMENT; (II) THE AMOUNT OF THE FEE CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER; (III) THE

AVAILABILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF TRAVELERS CHECKS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD; (IV)

THE COMPENSATION PAID TO, AND FREQUENCY OF SETTLEMENT BY, SELLING OUTLETS; (V)

THE ACCESSIBILITY OF TRAVELERS CHECK SALES AND REFUNDS; (VI) THE SUCCESS OF

MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS; AND (VII) THE ABILITY TO SERVICE THE CHECK

PURCHASER SATISFACTORILY IF THE CHECKS ARE LOST OR STOLEN.

AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS

THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS OPERATING

SEGMENT ("AEFA"), MAKES AVAILABLE A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

TO HELP INDIVIDUALS, BUSINESSES AND INSTITUTIONS ESTABLISH AND ACHIEVE THEIR

FINANCIAL GOALS. FINANCIAL PLANNING IS AT THE CORE OF AEFA'S BUSINESS, WHICH

HELPS CLIENTS MEET THEIR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GOALS. THE AEFA OPERATING SEGMENT

PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL CORPORATION ("AEFC") AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES DESCRIBED BELOW. AEFA'S BUSINESS CONSISTS OF THREE

PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS: RETAIL DISTRIBUTION, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INSURANCE AND

ANNUITIES.

RETAIL DISTRIBUTION

AEFA STRIVES TO HELP CLIENTS ACHIEVE THEIR FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES PRUDENTLY

AND THOUGHTFULLY THROUGH A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP BASED ON TRUSTED,

KNOWLEDGEABLE ADVICE. AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS WORK WITH RETAIL CLIENTS TO

DEVELOP STRONG RELATIONSHIPS AND LONG-TERM FINANCIAL STRATEGIES. AEFA'S

FINANCIAL ADVISORS ALSO PROVIDE EACH CLIENT ACCESS TO A BROAD ARRAY OF

PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCT AND SERVICE SOLUTIONS TO MEET THEIR

INDIVIDUAL NEEDS, INCLUDING ANNUITIES; A VARIETY OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING LIFE INSURANCE, DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE, LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE,

AND PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE; A VARIETY OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES AND MUTUAL FUNDS; INVESTMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING WRAP

PROGRAMS; A VARIETY OF TAX-QUALIFIED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT

ACCOUNTS, EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS AND SECTION 529 COLLEGE SAVINGS

PLANS; PERSONAL TRUST SERVICES; AND RETAIL SECURITIES BROKERAGE. AEFA ALSO

OFFERS ONLINE DIRECT BROKERAGE SERVICES.

SALES FORCE

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AEFA MAINTAINED A NATIONWIDE FIELD SALES FORCE OF

OVER 12,100 FINANCIAL ADVISORS, WHICH REPRESENTED A 4% INCREASE OVER 2002

AND SERVED MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION CLIENTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.

AEFA'S ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PROVIDES ADVISORS SEVERAL CHOICES IN HOW THEY

AFFILIATE WITH THE ORGANIZATION, EACH HAVING SEPARATE LEVELS OF SERVICE AND

COMPENSATION. THE EMPLOYEE ADVISOR PLATFORM PROVIDES COMPENSATION AS A DRAW

AGAINST COMMISSION. THE EMPLOYEE ADVISORS RECEIVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF SUPPORT IN

EXCHANGE FOR A LOWER PAYOUT RATE. IN THE BRANDED INDEPENDENT FRANCHISEE ADVISOR

PLATFORM, ADVISORS EARN A HIGHER PAYOUT RATE, BUT COVER THEIR OWN EXPENSES,

INCLUDING REAL ESTATE AND STAFF. AEFA ALSO OPERATES A NON-AMERICAN EXPRESS

BRANDED INDEPENDENT PLATFORM, SECURITIES AMERICA, INC., A BROKER-DEALER OWNED BY

AEFC. SECURITIES AMERICA DISTRIBUTES MUTUAL FUNDS, ANNUITIES AND INSURANCE

PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES AND WRAP PRODUCTS.

APPROXIMATELY 25% OF AEFA'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS ARE AMERICAN EXPRESS

EMPLOYEES; APPROXIMATELY 62% ARE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED FRANCHISEES; AND

APPROXIMATELY 13% ARE IN THE UNBRANDED PLATFORM. AS DISCUSSED BELOW, AEFA

RECEIVES A VARIETY OF FEES AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCTS SOLD BY

ITS FINANCIAL ADVISORS. IN TURN, AEFA PAYS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE REVENUE

RECEIVED IN THE FORM OF SALES CHARGES AND 12B-1 DISTRIBUTION FEES TO

26

ADVISORS FOR THEIR ROLE IN SERVING CLIENTS. THE RATE OF COMMISSION PAID TO EACH

ADVISOR IS DETERMINED BY A SCHEDULE THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE TYPE OF PRODUCT

SOLD, THE MANNER IN WHICH THE ADVISOR IS AFFILIATED WITH AEFA (AS DISCUSSED

ABOVE) AND OTHER CRITERIA.

DURING 2003, AEFA CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON IMPROVED RECRUITING AND SELECTION

OF EMPLOYEE ADVISORS TO DRIVE HIGHER RETENTION OF FIRST YEAR ADVISORS. AEFA

FURTHER IMPROVED THE SERVICE AND TOOLS PROVIDED TO FRANCHISEE ADVISORS. AEFA

ALSO CONTINUED EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF ITS DEDICATED FIELD FORCE TO

FURTHER ENHANCE ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND SERVE NEW CLIENTS AND TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY WITH THE LARGE SALES FORCES OF CERTAIN COMPETITORS. IN ATTRACTING

AND RETAINING MEMBERS OF THE FIELD FORCE, AEFA COMPETES WITH FINANCIAL PLANNING

FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS.

FINANCIAL PLANNING

AEFA'S FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO HELP CLIENTS MEET

IMPORTANT FINANCIAL GOALS, SUCH AS PROVIDING AN EDUCATION TO THEIR CHILDREN,

PURCHASING A HOME AND PROVIDING FOR THEIR RETIREMENT YEARS. THE FINANCIAL

PLANNING PROCESS GENERALLY BEGINS WITH A WRITTEN ANALYSIS AND PLAN BASED ON THE

CLIENT'S PERSONAL INFORMATION, GOALS AND NEEDS. ADVISORS TYPICALLY RECOMMEND A

RANGE OF PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BASED

ON SUCH PLAN AND WORK WITH THE CLIENT TO OBTAIN SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR

THE CLIENT'S ACCOUNT.

FOR ITS FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES, AEFA GENERALLY RECEIVES FEES BASED

UPON THE SERVICES THAT THE CLIENT SELECTS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CLIENT'S

FINANCIAL SITUATION. CLIENTS MAY BE CHARGED A FLAT FEE, AN HOURLY RATE OR A

COMBINATION OF THE TWO. THE FEE IS NOT BASED ON OR RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF

A CLIENT'S FUNDS OR ASSETS. DEPENDING ON WHAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR

SITUATION, CLIENTS MAY SELECT A LIMITED ENGAGEMENT PERIOD OR MAY ELECT TO

RECEIVE ONGOING FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES FROM THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS

FINANCIAL ADVISOR. THE FEES PAID IN CONNECTION WITH FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES

ARE SEPARATE FROM AND IN ADDITION TO FEES PAID FOR ANY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES PURCHASED FROM OR THROUGH AEFA OR ITS AFFILIATES.

AEFA ACHIEVED RECORD FINANCIAL PLANNING SALES AND FEE REVENUE IN 2003. PLAN

SALES INCREASED BY 13% AND FEES FROM FINANCIAL PLANS AND OTHER FEE-BASED ADVICE

INCREASED BY 6% OVER 2002. DURING 2003, NEARLY 51% OF NEW RETAIL CLIENTS HAD A

FINANCIAL PLAN DEVELOPED FOR THEM BY AN AEFA ADVISOR, UP 4% FROM 2002. AS HAS

BEEN THE CASE HISTORICALLY, CLIENTS WITH PLANS TEND TO BUY MORE PRODUCTS. ON

AVERAGE, THEY OWN ALMOST THREE TIMES AS MANY ACCOUNTS AS NON-PLANNING CLIENTS

AND HAVE MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH CASH INVESTED WITH AEFA. IN 2003, PRODUCT SALES

GENERATED THROUGH FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES WERE 75% OF TOTAL ADVISOR SALES,

AN INCREASE OF 2% OVER 2002. ALSO IN 2003, AEFA REACHED A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE,

EXCEEDING ONE MILLION CURRENT CLIENTS WITH A FINANCIAL PLAN.

AEFA CONTINUES TO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS AND TRAINING FOR ITS

ADVISORS TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN ITS ABILITY TO OFFER SOUND ADVICE AND ONGOING

FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES. IN DECEMBER 2002, AEFA CONTRACTED WITH MORNINGSTAR

ASSOCIATES, LLC TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE TOOLS THAT SERVE BOTH RETAIL AND

WORKPLACE MARKETS. AS A COMPLEMENT TO AEFA'S OWN PROPRIETARY SUITE OF FINANCIAL

PLANNING TOOLS, THE MORNINGSTAR'R' TOOLS ARE INTENDED TO ENABLE ADVISORS TO MEET

THE ONGOING FINANCIAL AND INVESTMENT PLANNING NEEDS OF MORE AFFLUENT CLIENTS.

AEFA LAUNCHED THE RESEARCH AND ILLUSTRATION FEATURES OF THESE TOOLS IN NOVEMBER

2003.

27

BROKERAGE SERVICES

AEFA HAS TAKEN STEPS TO INTEGRATE ITS DIRECT RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL

WITH THE ADVISOR CHANNEL. AEFA'S ONLINE BROKERAGE BUSINESS, AMERICAN EXPRESS

BROKERAGE, ALLOWS CLIENTS TO PURCHASE AND SELL SECURITIES ONLINE, OBTAIN

RESEARCH AND INFORMATION ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF SECURITIES, USE SELF-DIRECTED

ASSET ALLOCATION AND FINANCIAL PLANNING TOOLS, CONTACT AN ADVISOR, AS WELL AS

HAVE ACCESS TO MORE THAN 3,000 PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS,

AMONG OTHER SERVICES.

AEFA'S AMERICAN EXPRESS ONE'R' FINANCIAL ACCOUNT IS AN INTEGRATED FINANCIAL

MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT THAT COMBINES CLIENTS' INVESTMENT, BANKING AND LENDING

RELATIONSHIPS INTO A SINGLE ACCOUNT. THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ONE FINANCIAL ACCOUNT

ENABLES CLIENTS TO ACCESS A SINGLE CASH ACCOUNT TO FUND A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL

TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN MUTUAL FUNDS AND OTHER SECURITIES.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ONE FINANCIAL ACCOUNT INCLUDE

UNLIMITED CHECK WRITING WITH OVERDRAFT PROTECTION, AN AMERICAN EXPRESS GOLD

CARD, ONLINE BILL PAYMENTS, ATM ACCESS AND A HIGH-YIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

IN 2003, AEFA LAUNCHED AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT PAYS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS'R'

PROGRAM BONUS POINTS AND AMERICAN EXPRESS GIFT CHEQUES TO PERSONS OPENING AND

FUNDING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS ONE FINANCIAL ACCOUNT AND WHO THEN TAKE ADDITIONAL

STEPS TO TRANSFER FUNDS INTO THE ACCOUNT ON AN ONGOING BASIS THROUGH DIRECT

DEPOSIT OR BANK AUTHORIZATION.

AEFA ALSO LAUNCHED ITS FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS DATA AGGREGATION SERVICE, WHICH

IS AN ONLINE CAPABILITY THAT ENABLES CLIENTS TO VIEW AND MANAGE THEIR ENTIRE

AMERICAN EXPRESS RELATIONSHIP (I.E., BROKERAGE, CARD, 401(K), BANKING, FINANCIAL

ADVISOR) IN ONE PLACE VIA THE INTERNET. THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS SERVICE ALSO

ALLOWS CLIENTS TO ADD THIRD PARTY ACCOUNT INFORMATION, PROVIDING A CONSOLIDATED

VIEW OF THEIR FINANCIAL SERVICES ACCOUNT RELATIONSHIPS.

IN RECENT YEARS, AEFA HAS INCREASED ITS SALE OF NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS,

PARTICULARLY MUTUAL FUNDS, TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF CLIENTS FOR A BROADER CHOICE

OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS. DURING THE PAST YEAR, AEFA CREATED THE SELECT GROUP

PROGRAM FOR MUTUAL FUNDS. AS OF YEAR END 2003, THIS PROGRAM CONSISTED OF TWELVE

FUND FAMILIES, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS FUNDS, OFFERING MORE THAN 700 MUTUAL

FUNDS. FUND FAMILIES ARE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SELECT GROUP PROGRAM

BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA INCLUDING BRAND RECOGNITION, PRODUCT BREADTH,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND TRAINING AND WHOLESALING SUPPORT. IN EXCHANGE FOR

CERTAIN BENEFITS, SUCH AS BROADER ACCESS TO AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS,

FUND FAMILIES IN THE SELECT GROUP PROGRAM ARE REQUIRED TO PAY AEFA FOR

PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM BY SHARING WITH AEFA A PORTION OF THE REVENUE

GENERATED FROM THE SALES AND ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF FUND SHARES. AEFA MAY ALSO

RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM OTHER NON-PROPRIETARY FUND FAMILIES WHOSE PRODUCTS ARE

AVAILABLE THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND ONLINE BROKERAGE. AEFA

ALSO RECEIVES ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FEES FROM MOST FUNDS SOLD THROUGH ITS

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. SALES OF NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS

GENERALLY ARE LESS PROFITABLE THAN PROPRIETARY SALES.

IN ADDITION TO PURCHASES OF NON-PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS ON A STAND-ALONE

BASIS, CLIENTS MAY PURCHASE MUTUAL FUNDS IN CONNECTION WITH FEE-BASED PROGRAMS

OR SERVICES AND PAY A FEE BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS. ONE SUCH PROGRAM

28

SPONSORED BY AEFA IS AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' STRATEGIC PORTFOLIO SERVICE ADVANTAGE,

A NON-DISCRETIONARY WRAP PROGRAM FOR INVESTMENTS IN PROPRIETARY AND

NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS AND INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES BUILT AROUND

ASSET-ALLOCATION STRATEGIES. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF AEFA'S NON-PROPRIETARY

MUTUAL FUND SALES ARE MADE IN THESE PROGRAMS, AND THEY TEND TO BE MORE

PROFITABLE THAN THE SALE OF NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS ALONE.

DURING 2003, AEFA LAUNCHED AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' PREMIER PORTFOLIO SERVICES

("PREMIER"), A SERVICE THAT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE CONSOLIDATED REPORTING

AND INFORMATION ON ONE OR MORE FEE-BASED ACCOUNTS. THE FEE-BASED ACCOUNTS

AVAILABLE IN PREMIER INCLUDE NON-DISCRETIONARY BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, FOR WHICH

CLIENTS PAY A FLAT ASSET-BASED FEE IN LIEU OF INDIVIDUAL COMMISSIONS ON

TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED IN MUTUAL FUNDS AND INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES. ALSO AVAILABLE

IN PREMIER IS THE SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNT PROGRAM, A WRAP FEE PROGRAM IN

WHICH CLIENTS SELECT ONE OR MORE PROFESSIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS TO PROVIDE

DISCRETIONARY ASSET MANAGEMENT SERVICES. CLIENTS IN AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' WEALTH

MANAGEMENT SERVICE ("WMS"), ANOTHER PROFESSIONALLY MANAGED DISCRETIONARY WRAP

SERVICE SPONSORED BY AEFA THAT IS BEING DISCONTINUED, HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPTION

TO TRANSITION TO THE SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNT PROGRAM WITHIN PREMIER.

AEFA FINANCIAL ADVISORS ALSO SELL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS SPONSORED

BY OTHER COMPANIES. AEFA ALSO SERVICES, BUT DOES NOT SELL, MANAGED FUTURES

LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS IN WHICH AN AEFC SUBSIDIARY IS A CO-GENERAL PARTNER, WHICH

SUBJECTS AEFA AND ITS AFFILIATED CO-GENERAL PARTNER TO REGULATION BY THE CFTC.

ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES

IN 2003, AEFA CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS SECURITIES BROKERAGE SERVICES.

AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INVESTMENT SERVICES INC. ("AEIS"), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY

OF AEFC, PROVIDES SECURITIES EXECUTION AND CLEARANCE SERVICES FOR RETAIL AND

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS OF AEFA. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, AEIS HELD OVER $60

BILLION IN ASSETS FOR CLIENTS, AN INCREASE OF $18 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31,

2002. AEIS IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER-DEALER WITH THE SEC, IS A MEMBER OF THE

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS, INC. ("NASD") AND THE CHICAGO STOCK

EXCHANGE AND IS REGISTERED WITH APPROPRIATE STATES.

AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS INC. ("AEFAI"), AEFC'S PRINCIPAL

AND REGISTRATIONS.

SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THESE TAX-QUALIFIED

ASSETS EQUALED $77.5 BILLION, WHICH IS IN EXCESS OF 21% OF TOTAL INSTITUTIONAL

AND RETAIL ASSETS OWNED, MANAGED AND ADMINISTERED BY AEFA.

29

AEFA IS THE PRIMARY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL FOR THE PERSONAL TRUST SERVICES

DIVISION ("PTS") OF AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB ("AEBFSB"), WHICH PROVIDES

PERSONAL TRUST, CUSTODIAL, AGENCY AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO

INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS. AEBFSB IS A FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK REGULATED AND SUPERVISED BY

THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION (THE "OTS") AND REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AS AN

INVESTMENT ADVISER. AS DISCLOSED ABOVE (IN "TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES") IN

DECEMBER, 2003, AEBFSB AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES RECEIVED OTS APPROVAL TO

AMEND ITS BUSINESS PLAN TO PERMIT IT TO OFFER CERTAIN CREDIT, CHARGE AND

CONSUMER LENDING PRODUCTS, SMALL BUSINESS LOANS, MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE-RELATED

PRODUCTS AND TO OPERATE A TRANSACTIONAL INTERNET SITE.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S GOAL OF LEVERAGING BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

ACROSS ALL OF ITS UNITS, AEFA CONTINUES TO INCREASE ITS SALES TO CUSTOMERS FROM

OTHER AMERICAN EXPRESS BUSINESSES. AEFA'S FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND PLANNING

SERVICES ("FEPS") GROUP PROVIDES WORKPLACE FINANCIAL EDUCATION AND ADVISORY

SERVICES PROGRAMS TO THE 401(K) CLIENT BASE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT

SERVICES ("AERS") AND AMERICAN EXPRESS TRUST COMPANY AND TO OTHER MAJOR

CORPORATIONS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. FOCUSED ON THE GOAL OF CREATING ADVISOR

RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES OF CLIENT COMPANIES, FEPS TRAINS AND

SUPPORTS ADVISORS WORKING ON-SITE AT COMPANY LOCATIONS PRESENTING EDUCATIONAL

SEMINARS, CONDUCTING ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS AND PARTICIPATING IN COMPANY

EDUCATIONAL EVENTS. IN 2003, AEFA EXPANDED ITS ON-SITE ACTIVITIES WITH 401(K)

CLIENTS AND HAD SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SALES OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION

RELATIONSHIPS TO COMPANIES THAT DO NOT HAVE A 401(K) RELATIONSHIP WITH AERS.

DURING 2003, AEFA ALSO PROVIDED FINANCIAL ADVICE SERVICE OFFERINGS TAILORED

TO DISCRETE EMPLOYEE SEGMENTS, SUCH AS FEPS EXECUTIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES. THE

GROWTH AND SUCCESS OF FEPS IS CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND AEFA'S

BELIEF THAT MARKETPLACE DEMAND FOR EMPLOYEE FINANCIAL EDUCATION IS EXPECTED TO

REMAIN HIGH, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CONTINUING TREND TOWARD INCREASED EMPLOYEE

RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTING RETIREMENT INVESTMENTS. AS THIS SERVICE NEED GROWS,

SO TOO DOES THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS SEEKING TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEE EDUCATION AND

PLANNING SERVICES.

IN 2003, AEFA CONTINUED TO LEVERAGE OTHER AMERICAN EXPRESS RELATIONSHIPS

WITH MAJOR COMPANIES TO CREATE ALLIANCES THAT HELP GENERATE NEW FINANCIAL

SERVICES CLIENTS. AEFA CONTINUED ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH COSTCO WHOLESALE IN 2003.

THE COSTCO WHOLESALE/AEFA RELATIONSHIP OFFERS ADVISORS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MARKET

FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE SERVICES TO MILLIONS OF COSTCO WHOLESALE MEMBERS,

THROUGH VARIOUS MARKETING CHANNELS. IN 2003, AEFA ENTERED INTO A NEW MARKETING

ALLIANCE WITH DELTA AIR LINES. THE DELTA/AEFA MARKETING ALLIANCE PROVIDES AEFA

WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO MARKET TO THE MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS WHO HAVE A

RELATIONSHIP WITH DELTA THROUGH ITS DELTA SKYMILES'R' PROGRAM, INCLUDING THOSE

CONSUMERS WHO ALREADY CARRY THE COBRANDED AMERICAN EXPRESS/DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT

CARD. AEFA ALSO HAS A MARKETING AGREEMENT WITH SALLIE MAE, INC., THE EDUCATIONAL

LOAN COMPANY. THE AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS EXECUTED IN JULY 2003, ALLOWS SALLIE MAE

CUSTOMERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SPECIAL FINANCIAL ADVICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS

THROUGH AEFA INTERNET, E-MAIL, DIRECT MAIL AND NEWSLETTER PROMOTIONS.

30

THE INTERNET ALSO CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT AND COST EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR

ACQUIRING NEW CUSTOMERS. ADVISOR LEADS ARE GENERATED VIA THE INTERNET AT A

SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED COST VERSUS ALTERNATIVE CHANNELS. ADDITIONALLY, THE

INTERNET CONTINUES TO REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT VEHICLE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ACROSS

ALL CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION.

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT

COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON COST,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, YIELD, CONVENIENCE, SERVICE, RELIABILITY, SAFETY,

INNOVATION, DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION. ALSO,

REPUTATION AND BRAND INTEGRITY ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE IMPORTANT AS THE

MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY GENERALLY AND CERTAIN FIRMS IN PARTICULAR HAVE COME UNDER

REGULATORY AND MEDIA SCRUTINY. SEE " - REGULATION OF RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND

ASSET MANAGEMENT" BELOW. COMPETITION IN THIS INDUSTRY IS VERY INTENSE. AEFA

COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS BANKS, SECURITIES

BROKERS, MUTUAL FUNDS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. SOME OF THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE

LARGER, HAVE GREATER RESOURCES AND ARE MORE GLOBAL THAN AEFA. MANY OF THESE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALSO HAVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT INCREASINGLY CROSS

OVER THE TRADITIONAL LINES THAT PREVIOUSLY DIFFERENTIATED ONE TYPE OF

INSTITUTION FROM ANOTHER, THEREBY HEIGHTENING COMPETITION FOR AEFA. THE ABILITY

OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO OFFER ONLINE INVESTMENT AND INFORMATION

SERVICES HAS ALSO AFFECTED THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

AEFA BELIEVES THAT ITS FOCUS ON FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE, COUPLED WITH

AN ABILITY TO PROVIDE BROAD-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON A RELATIONSHIP BASIS,

IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS MORE

RELEVANT TODAY THAN IN THE PAST AS A RESULT OF THE SIGNIFICANT MARKET VOLATILITY

EXPERIENCED DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS.

UNLIKE MANY OF AEFA'S COMPETITORS, WHOSE FIELD FORCES TYPICALLY COMPRISE

BROKERS WHO FOCUS ON COMPLETING TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF AEFA'S ADVISORS ARE

CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER'R'* PRACTITIONERS WHO WORK CLOSELY WITH CLIENTS TO

DEVELOP LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLANS. AEFA BELIEVES THAT THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO AN

ANNUAL CLIENT RETENTION RATE THAT EXCEEDS 94%. MANY MAJOR BROKERAGE FIRMS ARE

ATTEMPTING TO MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR HISTORICAL TRANSACTION ORIENTATION AND TOWARD

FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ADVICE, AEFA'S HISTORICAL FOCUS AND LONGSTANDING

STRENGTH.

AEFA'S BUSINESS DOES NOT, AS A WHOLE, EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATIONS.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

AEFA'S ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS OFFERS A RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

INCLUDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR FIXED INCOME, EQUITY AND

INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. AEFA AFFILIATES PROVIDE ASSET MANAGEMENT

AND RELATED SERVICES TO TWO MAJOR GROUPS OF RETAIL INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, THE AXP

FUNDS, AMERICAN EXPRESS'S FAMILY OF PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS, AND AMERICAN

EXPRESS CERTIFICATE COMPANY, AN ISSUER OF FACE AMOUNT INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES.

ADDITIONALLY, AEFA PROVIDES ASSET MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS

INSURANCE COMPANIES' GENERAL AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. THE SEPARATE ACCOUNTS ARE

ORGANIZED AS UNIT INVESTMENT TRUSTS, WHICH IN TURN INVEST IN VARIOUS PROPRIETARY

AND NON-PROPRIETARY REGISTERED

----------

* REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER BOARD OF STANDARDS INC.

31

INVESTMENT COMPANIES. AEFA'S ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS PROVIDES INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO THE PROPRIETARY REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES THAT

INCLUDE THE VP FUNDS, A PART OF THE AXP FUND FAMILY, IDS LIFE SERIES FUNDS, INC.

AND FUNDS A & B. FOR INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS, AEFA OFFERS SERVICES SUCH AS

SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSET MANAGEMENT, INSTITUTIONAL TRUST AND CUSTODY, AND EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLAN ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS HEDGE FUNDS.

IN 2003, ONE OF AEFA'S GOALS WAS TO INCREASE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF ITS

PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR BOTH RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS.

IN FURTHERANCE OF THIS GOAL AEFA TOOK SEVERAL STEPS TO STRENGTHEN ITS ASSET

MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING.

O    THE ACQUISITION OF THREADNEEDLE ASSET MANAGEMENT HOLDINGS LTD.

("THREADNEEDLE"), A GROUP BASED IN LONDON THAT MANAGES ASSETS FOR

INSURANCE COMPANIES, PRIVATE INVESTORS, CORPORATIONS, INVESTMENT

FUNDS, PENSION PLANS, AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF ZURICH

FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, THE PARTY FROM WHICH THREADNEEDLE WAS

ACQUIRED;

O    THE REORGANIZATION OF ITS FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

STAFF INTO TEAMS RESPONSIBLE FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND

TRADING, AND TEAMS RESPONSIBLE FOR RESEARCH FOR INVESTMENT GRADE

CORPORATE BONDS, HIGH YIELD BONDS, AND CASH; AND

O    THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PLANS TO MERGE SEVERAL EQUITY MUTUAL FUNDS IN

2004.

OVERALL, DESPITE SOME WEAKER THAN TARGETED PERFORMANCE IN SOME OF AEFA'S

EQUITY FUNDS IN 2003, AEFA HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. NONETHELESS, AEFA RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO

CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THIS PROGRESS IN ORDER TO INCREASE ITS COMPETITIVENESS IN

THE INDUSTRY.

AEFA'S INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS BENEFITED IN 2003 FROM AN INCREASE IN

MANAGEMENT FEES RESULTING FROM HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT,

REFLECTING THE THREADNEEDLE ACQUISITION. SINCE MOST FEES THAT AEFA RECEIVES FOR

ASSET MANAGEMENT SERVICES ARE BASED ON ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, MARKET

APPRECIATION RESULTS IN INCREASED REVENUES, AND INVERSELY, MARKET DEPRECIATION

WILL DEPRESS AEFA'S REVENUES.

MUTUAL FUNDS

AEFA OFFERS A VARIETY OF PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS, FOR WHICH AEFAI ACTS AS

PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER (DISTRIBUTOR OF SHARES). AEFA MUTUAL FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED

EXCLUSIVELY BY AEFA ADVISORS AND THROUGH THE RETIREMENT SERVICES AND INSURANCE

THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES DISCUSSED BELOW. AEFC ACTS AS INVESTMENT

MANAGER FOR THE FUNDS, AND AEFC AND ITS AFFILIATES PERFORM VARIOUS

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FOR THE FUNDS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE AXP FUNDS

CONSISTED OF 64 RETAIL MUTUAL FUNDS, OF WHICH SIX WERE LAUNCHED IN 2003, WITH

VARIED INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES. THE AXP FUNDS, WITH COMBINED ASSETS AT DECEMBER

31, 2003, OF $68.8 BILLION, WERE THE 29TH LARGEST MUTUAL FUND FAMILY IN THE

UNITED STATES AND, EXCLUDING MONEY MARKET FUNDS, WERE THE 17TH LARGEST. THE VP

FUNDS CONSIST OF 22 VARIABLE PRODUCT PORTFOLIOS (INCLUDING THREE

32

PORTFOLIOS THAT WERE ADDED IN EARLY 2004) THAT OFFER A VARIETY OF INVESTMENT

STRATEGIES INCLUDING CASH MANAGEMENT, FIXED INCOME AND DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY. THE VP FUNDS HAD COMBINED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, OF

$15.7 BILLION.

LATE IN 2003, THREADNEEDLE PERSONNEL, AS ASSOCIATED PERSONS OF AMERICAN

EXPRESS ASSET MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL, INC., ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR SEVERAL

OF AEFA'S INTERNATIONAL EQUITY PORTFOLIOS, INCLUDING SEVERAL OF THE AXP AND VP

FUNDS. IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO IMPROVE ITS LINE OF MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTS, AEFA

PROPOSED TO THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF THE AXP FUNDS THAT SEVERAL FUNDS BE

MERGED. SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR-END, THE FUND BOARDS APPROVED THE PROPOSED MERGERS

AND RECOMMENDED THAT THEY BE PUT TO VOTE OF THE FUNDS' RESPECTIVE SHAREHOLDERS,

WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004.

AEFC EARNS MANAGEMENT FEES FOR MANAGING THE ASSETS OF THE AXP FUNDS BASED

ON THE UNDERLYING ASSET VALUES. MOST OF THE PROPRIETARY EQUITY MUTUAL FUNDS HAVE

A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE ADJUSTMENT ("PIA"). THIS PIA ADJUSTS THE LEVEL OF

MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED, BOTH UPWARD AND DOWNWARD, BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FUND'S

RELATIVE PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED AGAINST A DESIGNATED EXTERNAL INDEX OF PEERS.

AEFA EARNS FEES FOR DISTRIBUTING THE AXP FUNDS THROUGH POINT-OF-SALE FEES (SALES

CHARGES OR LOADS) AND DISTRIBUTION FEES (12B-1 FEES) BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF

ASSETS.

THE AXP FUNDS ARE SOLD IN MULTIPLE CLASSES. FOR MOST FUNDS, SHARES ARE SOLD

IN FOUR CLASSES - A, B, C AND Y. INDEX FUND SHARES ARE SOLD IN TWO CLASSES - D

AND E. CLASS A SHARES ARE SOLD AT NET ASSET VALUE PLUS ANY APPLICABLE SALES

CHARGE. THE MAXIMUM SALES CHARGE IS 5.75% FOR EQUITY FUNDS AND 4.75% FOR INCOME

FUNDS, WITH REDUCED SALES CHARGES FOR LARGER PURCHASES. THE SALES CHARGE MAY BE

WAIVED FOR CERTAIN PURCHASES, INCLUDING THOSE MADE THROUGH AN INVESTMENT PRODUCT

SPONSORED BY AEFAI OR ANOTHER AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY. CLASS B SHARES

ARE SOLD WITH A CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE OR BACK-END LOAD. THE MAXIMUM

DEFERRED SALES CHARGE IS 5%, DECLINING TO NO CHARGE FOR SHARES HELD MORE THAN

SIX YEARS. CLASS C SHARES DO NOT HAVE A FRONT-END SALES CHARGE. A 1% CONTINGENT

DEFERRED SALES CHARGE MAY APPLY TO SHARES REDEEMED LESS THAN ONE YEAR AFTER

PURCHASE. CLASS Y SHARES ARE PRIMARILY SOLD TO INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS WITH NO

LOAD. THERE ARE TWO INDEX FUNDS, WHICH ARE SOLD IN TWO NO-LOAD CLASSES. CLASS D

SHARES ARE SOLD WITH A 0.25% FEE FOR DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, BUT WITHOUT A SALES

CHARGE, THROUGH AN INVESTMENT PRODUCT SPONSORED BY AEFAI OR ANOTHER AUTHORIZED

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. CLASS E SHARES ARE SOLD WITHOUT A SALES OR DISTRIBUTION

FEE THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS AND QUALIFYING INSTITUTIONAL

ACCOUNTS.

FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES

AMERICAN EXPRESS CERTIFICATE COMPANY ("AECC"), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

AEFC, ISSUES FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES. AECC IS REGISTERED AS AN INVESTMENT

COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940. AECC CURRENTLY ISSUES NINE

TYPES OF FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES. OWNERS OF AECC CERTIFICATES ARE ENTITLED TO

RECEIVE, AT MATURITY, A STATED AMOUNT OF MONEY EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE

INVESTMENTS IN THE CERTIFICATE PLUS INTEREST AT RATES DECLARED FROM TIME TO TIME

BY AECC. IN ADDITION, PERSONS OWNING THREE TYPES OF CERTIFICATES MAY HAVE THEIR

INTEREST CALCULATED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BASED ON ANY UPWARD MOVEMENT IN A

BROAD-BASED STOCK MARKET INDEX UP TO A VARIABLE MAXIMUM RETURN. THE CERTIFICATES

ISSUED BY AECC ARE NOT INSURED

33

BY ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY. AEFC ACTS AS INVESTMENT MANAGER FOR AECC. CERTIFICATES

ARE SOLD BY AEFA'S FIELD FORCE. AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK ALSO MARKETS AECC

CERTIFICATES.

AECC BELIEVES IT IS THE LARGEST ISSUER OF FACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES IN THE

UNITED STATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, IT HAD APPROXIMATELY $5.3 BILLION IN

ASSETS. AECC'S CERTIFICATES COMPETE WITH MANY OTHER INVESTMENTS OFFERED BY

BANKS, SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS, CREDIT UNIONS, MUTUAL FUNDS, INSURANCE

COMPANIES AND SIMILAR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH MAY BE VIEWED BY POTENTIAL

CUSTOMERS AS OFFERING A COMPARABLE OR SUPERIOR COMBINATION OF SAFETY AND RETURN

ON INVESTMENT. IN TIMES OF WEAK PERFORMANCE IN THE EQUITY MARKETS, CERTIFICATE

SALES ARE GENERALLY STRONGER.

AEFC ALSO OPERATES A JOINT VENTURE IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS WITH ITS

AFFILIATE, AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, THAT ISSUES DEPOSIT CERTIFICATES DENOMINATED

IN U.S. DOLLARS, EUROS, POUNDS STERLING AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS.

INSTITUTIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

(COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS ("CDO")).

FOR ITS INVESTMENT SERVICES, AEAMG GENERALLY RECEIVES FEES BASED ON THE

MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. CLIENTS MAY ALSO PAY FEES TO AEAMG

BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR PORTFOLIO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AEAMG MANAGED

ASSETS ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS (INCLUDING ASSETS MANAGED OR ADMINISTERED ON BEHALF

OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES) IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS AND ALTERNATIVE

INVESTMENT VEHICLES IN THE UNITED STATES TOTALING $15.1 BILLION COMPARED TO

$14.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

AEAMG PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AS COLLATERAL MANAGER TO

VARIOUS SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLES THAT ISSUE SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY A POOL

OF ASSETS, I.E., CDOS. AEAMG ALSO PROVIDES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO

SECURED LOAN TRUSTS ("SLTS"). AEAMG OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES

HAS INVESTED ITS OWN MONEY IN SUCH VEHICLES, INCLUDING IN RESIDUAL OR "EQUITY"

INTERESTS, WHICH ARE ILLIQUID AND THE MOST SUBORDINATED (AND ACCORDINGLY,

RISKIEST AND MOST VOLATILE) INTERESTS IN SUCH VEHICLES. PURSUANT TO ITS ADOPTION

OF

34

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, "CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES" ("FIN

46"), AEFA WAS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE ONE CDO AND THREE SLTS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2003, WHICH RESULTED IN A NON-CASH CHARGE OF $13 MILLION ($20 MILLION PRETAX)

AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF $1.2 BILLION IN NEW ASSETS AND $500 MILLION IN NEW

LIABILITIES. ONGOING VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE

APPLICATION OF FIN 46 TO THE CDO ARE ALSO NON-CASH AND WILL BE REFLECTED IN

OPERATING RESULTS OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE STRUCTURE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS,

IN THE AGGREGATE, SUCH GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE CDO, INCLUDING THE

IMPLEMENTATION CHARGE, TO REVERSE THEMSELVES OVER TIME AS THE STRUCTURE MATURES,

BECAUSE THE DEBT ISSUED TO THE INVESTORS IN THE CDO IS NON-RECOURSE TO THE

COMPANY, AND FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSETS WILL BE ABSORBED

BY THE THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS. TO THE EXTENT LOSSES ARE INCURRED ON THE SLT

PORTFOLIO, CHARGES COULD BE INCURRED THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE REVERSED. FOR A

COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF FIN 46 ON AEFA AND THE COMPANY, SEE PAGES

29 THROUGH 30 AND PAGES 66 THROUGH 67 OF THE 2003 ANNUAL REPORT, AS WELL AS NOTE

1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY ON PAGE 78 AND PAGES

83 THROUGH 84 OF THE 2003 ANNUAL REPORT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE CDO RESIDUAL TRANCHES

AND SLT NOTES MANAGED BY AEFA BUT NOT CONSOLIDATED PURSUANT TO FIN 46 WERE $16

MILLION AND NIL, RESPECTIVELY. AEFA ALSO HAS AN INTEREST IN A CDO SECURITIZATION

(SEE " - INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES - SECURITIZATION OF CERTAIN INSURANCE ASSETS"),

AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL $28 MILLION IN RATED CDO TRANCHES AND $27 MILLION IN

MINORITY-OWNED SLTS, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THIRD PARTIES AND NOT

CONSOLIDATED PURSUANT TO FIN 46. CDOS AND SLTS ARE ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS. AEFA'S

INVESTMENT RETURN ON CDOS CORRELATES TO THE PERFORMANCE OF PORTFOLIOS OF

HIGH-YIELD BONDS AND/OR BANK LOANS AND ITS RETURN ON SLTS IS BASED ON A

REFERENCE PORTFOLIO OF LOANS. GENERALLY, THE SLTS ARE STRUCTURED SUCH THAT THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE LOANS IN THE REFERENCE PORTFOLIO TO WHICH THE SLTS

CORRELATE MAY BE UP TO FIVE TIMES THAT OF THE PAR AMOUNT OF THE NOTES HELD BY

AEFA. DETERIORATION IN THE VALUE OF HIGH-YIELD BONDS OR BANK LOANS WOULD LIKELY

RESULT IN DETERIORATION OF INVESTMENT RETURN ON THE RELEVANT CDO OR SLT, AS THE

CASE MAY BE. IN THE EVENT OF SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION OF A PORTFOLIO, THE

RELEVANT CDO OR SLT MAY BE SUBJECT TO EARLY LIQUIDATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN

FURTHER DETERIORATION OF THE INVESTMENT RETURN OR, IN SEVERE CASES, LOSS OF THE

CARRYING AMOUNT. DETERIORATION OF A PORTFOLIO WOULD LIKELY HAVE A NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT FEES.

INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES ARE OFFERED TO DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS AND MUTUAL FUNDS BY OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF

AEFC. THE ACQUISITION OF THREADNEEDLE IN SEPTEMBER 2003 HELPED FACILITATE

CONSOLIDATION OF INTERNATIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, RESULTING IN THE CESSATION OF MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN SINGAPORE AND

TOKYO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AEAMG'S INTERNATIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT SUBSIDIARY

MANAGED $3.4 BILLION IN THE AGGREGATE, OF WHICH $2.4 BILLION REPRESENTED MUTUAL

FUND ASSETS.

THREADNEEDLE

AEFA'S INTERNATIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS IS BASED IN LONDON AND

OPERATES UNDER THE THREADNEEDLE GROUP OF COMPANIES. THREADNEEDLE OFFERS ASSET

MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING SEGREGATED ASSET MANAGEMENT, MUTUAL FUNDS AND

HEDGE FUNDS TO INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS AND TO INTERMEDIARIES, BANKS AND FUNDS

PLATFORMS PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, GERMANY,

35

AUSTRIA AND ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE. WITH THE RECOVERY OF MARKETS IN 2003,

THREADNEEDLE BENEFITED FROM GROWTH IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT BOTH THROUGH NEW

CLIENT BUSINESS AND ORGANIC MARKET GROWTH OF EXISTING FUNDS. THOSE ASSETS

COMPRISE MOST ASSET CLASSES INCLUDING EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME, CASH AND REAL

ESTATE.

THREADNEEDLE EMPLOYS APPROXIMATELY 1,000 PERSONS AND MAINTAINS ALL OF ITS

ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS. THREADNEEDLE HAS A SALES AND

MARKETING PRESENCE IN GERMANY AND REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES IN FRANCE AND

SWITZERLAND.

THREADNEEDLE'S BUSINESSES ARE ORGANIZED ALONG THREE LINES, NAMELY, RETAIL,

INSTITUTIONAL AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES.

THE RETAIL BUSINESS LINE INCLUDES THREADNEEDLE'S U.K. MUTUAL FUND FAMILY,

WHICH RANKS AS THE SECOND LARGEST RETAIL FUND COMPLEX IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

THREADNEEDLE MUTUAL FUNDS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND GERMANY

THROUGH FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES AND INSTITUTIONS. IN 2003 THREADNEEDLE SAW A

CONTINUED TREND IN THE AGGREGATION OF RETAIL BUSINESS IN EUROPE THROUGH FUNDS OF

FUNDS, BANKS AND FUNDS PLATFORMS. THE RETAIL BUSINESS UNIT ALSO INCLUDES

THREADNEEDLE'S HEDGE FUNDS COMPRISING TWO LONG/SHORT EQUITY FUNDS AND ONE FIXED

INCOME FUND. INFLOWS INTO THESE HEDGE FUND PRODUCTS DURING 2003 BROUGHT ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT IN THESE PRODUCTS TO $1.3 BILLION.

THE INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS OFFERS TRADITIONAL SEGREGATED ASSET MANAGEMENT

TO U.K. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION FUNDS AND INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS OFFERING

MUTUAL FUND-BASED PRODUCTS TO PENSION FUNDS. THREADNEEDLE EXPERIENCED CONTINUED

GROWTH IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ASSETS FOR U.K. INSTITUTIONS DURING 2003 AS IT

ATTRACTED SEVERAL NEW CLIENTS.

THREADNEEDLE'S STRATEGIC ALLIANCES BUSINESS COMPRISES THE ASSET MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THREADNEEDLE FOR THE ZURICH GROUP AND FOR OTHER

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANIES AND CLIENTS. THE ZURICH GROUP REPRESENTS

THREADNEEDLE'S SINGLE LARGEST CLIENT. THREADNEEDLE MANAGES ASSETS FOR THE ZURICH

GROUP FOR BOTH ITS U.K. AND INTERNATIONAL LIFE FUNDS AND FOR ITS GENERAL

INSURANCE ASSETS AS WELL AS OFFERING THREADNEEDLE MUTUAL FUNDS PRODUCTS THROUGH

ZURICH'S U.K. SALES FORCE. THREADNEEDLE WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE CERTAIN ASSETS

OF ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES U.K., WHICH COMPRISE A MAJORITY OF THREADNEEDLE

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, SUBJECT TO

ITS MEETING STANDARD PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. AS A RESULT OF ITS ACQUISITION BY

AEFA, THREADNEEDLE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERTAKE ASSET

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ITS CLIENTS, WHICH ADDED

APPROXIMATELY $3.7 BILLION OF ASSETS UNDER THREADNEEDLE'S MANAGEMENT DURING THE

LATTER PART OF 2003 CONSISTING OF MUTUAL FUNDS SOLD BY OTHER BUSINESS GROUPS

WITHIN AEFA AND THE COMPANY AND INSTITUTIONAL SEGREGATED ACCOUNT BUSINESS, OF

WHICH $3.3 BILLION WAS CO-MANAGED BY AEFA.

IN ADDITION TO THESE THREE MAIN LINES OF BUSINESS, DURING 2003 THREADNEEDLE

ALSO ACQUIRED A SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST IN AN INSTITUTIONAL MULTI-MANAGER BUSINESS

(MM ASSET MANAGEMENT (FORMERLY KNOWN AS ATTICA ASSET MANAGEMENT)) WITH $612

MILLION UNDER MANAGEMENT. THIS BUSINESS MANAGES TWO DUBLIN-BASED INSTITUTIONAL

FUNDS-OF-FUNDS THAT ARE SOLD TO SMALL MARKET PENSION FUND CLIENTS IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM THROUGH CONSULTING ACTUARY FIRMS. THREADNEEDLE

36

INTENDS TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THIS BUSINESS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL

AND MULTI-MANAGER MARKETS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

THREADNEEDLE'S OVERALL STRATEGY IS TO CONTINUE TO GROW ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT IN EACH OF ITS THREE BUSINESSES AT EFFECTIVE MARGINS. TO EXECUTE THIS

STRATEGY THREADNEEDLE EXPECTS TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHER

PRODUCTS FOR BOTH THE RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL MARKETS AS WELL AS CONTINUED

EFFORTS TO ATTRACT NEW RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS.

ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES

THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS TRUST COMPANY ("AETC"), AEFA OFFERS RETIREMENT

PLAN-RELATED SERVICES TO MID- AND LARGE-SIZE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS, GOVERNMENTAL

ENTITIES AND LABOR UNIONS. THE PRIMARY MARKET IS FOR RETIREMENT PLANS WITH AT

LEAST $10 MILLION IN ASSETS. AETC IS A MINNESOTA CHARTERED, LIMITED SERVICE

TRUST COMPANY THAT PRIMARILY PROVIDES TRUSTEE, CUSTODIAL, RECORD KEEPING,

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, SECURITIES LENDING AND COMMON TRUST FUND SERVICES FOR

EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS, INCLUDING PENSION, PROFIT SHARING, 401(K)

AND OTHER QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS. SERVICES

INCLUDE A WIDE ARRAY OF INVESTMENT OPTIONS, PARTICIPANT EDUCATION OFFERINGS AND

BOTH TELEPHONE AND INTERNET-BASED PLAN SERVICING.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AETC ACTED AS DIRECTED TRUSTEE OR CUSTODIAN OF 297

BENEFIT PLANS, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY $31.5 BILLION IN ASSETS MANAGED

OR ADMINISTERED (INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION OF ASSETS MANAGED OR

ADMINISTERED ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES), AND APPROXIMATELY ONE

MILLION PARTICIPANTS. THIS INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $5.5 BILLION INVESTED IN

PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS, $5.8 BILLION INVESTED IN NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS,

$12.6 BILLION ACTIVELY MANAGED BY AETC THROUGH BOTH SEPARATE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS

AND COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS, $7.6 BILLION OF ASSETS ADMINISTERED BY AETC,

$57.6 MILLION INVESTED THROUGH PARTICIPANT DIRECTED BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS, AND

$20.0 MILLION INVESTED IN ANNUITIES.

FOR ITS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AETC RECEIVES FEES THAT ARE

GENERALLY BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT. AETC CLIENTS TYPICALLY DO NOT PAY FEES TO AETC BASED ON THE

PERFORMANCE OF THEIR PORTFOLIO. AEFA WILL ALSO RECEIVE REVENUES BASED UPON

SERVICING AGREEMENTS FROM BOTH THE PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY MUTUAL FUNDS

THAT ARE GENERALLY BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS

INVESTED IN THE MUTUAL FUNDS, AND, IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, MAY ALSO INCLUDE

REVENUES ON A PER PARTICIPANT BASIS. WHILE AETC AND AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT

SERVICES MAY ALSO RECEIVE FEES THAT ARE ASSESSED AS A FLAT FEE OR ON A PER

PARTICIPANT BASIS, REVENUES ARE PRINCIPALLY BASED UPON THE VALUE OF ASSETS

MANAGED OR ADMINISTERED, WHICH MAY FLUCTUATE DUE TO MANY FACTORS, MOST NOTABLY

DUE TO NET INFLOWS OR OUTFLOWS OF ASSETS AND FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN THE EQUITY AND

FIXED-INCOME MARKETS. THROUGH ITS TRUSTEE AND CUSTODIAL SERVICES, AETC MAY ENTER

INTO AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO QUALIFIED EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT

PLANS HOLDING EMPLOYER STOCK.

AETC ALSO PROVIDES INSTITUTIONAL ASSET CUSTODIAL SERVICES TO AEFC AND THE

AEFA AFFILIATES PROVIDING MUTUAL FUNDS, INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES, ASSET

MANAGEMENT AND LIFE INSURANCE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, AETC'S INSTITUTIONAL

ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY WERE APPROXIMATELY $110.8 BILLION. AETC CUSTODY REVENUES

ARE PRINCIPALLY BASED UPON THE VALUE OF ASSETS IN CUSTODY, WHICH

37

MAY FLUCTUATE DUE TO MANY FACTORS, MOST NOTABLY DUE TO NET INFLOWS OR OUTFLOWS

OF ASSETS AND FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN THE EQUITY AND FIXED-INCOME MARKETS.

COMPETITION

AEFA'S ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITION. IN

ADDITION TO FULL-COMMISSION AND DISCOUNT BROKERAGE FIRMS, COMPETITORS INCLUDE

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. TRENDS IN

THE MARKET OVER THE LAST DECADE, INCLUDING THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR MUTUAL FUNDS

BY RETAIL INVESTORS, HAVE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS IN THE INDUSTRY.

SOME COMPETITORS ARE LARGER AND MORE DIVERSIFIED, OFFER A GREATER NUMBER OF

PRODUCTS AND MAY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER AEFA IN THEIR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND

RETAIN CUSTOMERS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR BEING ABLE TO MARKET THEMSELVES AS A

"ONE-STOP SHOP" THAT CAN MEET ALL OF THEIR CLIENTS' PERSONAL FINANCIAL NEEDS OR

IN THEIR ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR FUNDS THROUGH MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF

DISTRIBUTION. THE COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE SALE OF MUTUAL FUNDS INCLUDE

SALES CHARGES PAID, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, SERVICES RECEIVED, THE ABILITY TO

ATTRACT AND RETAIN A NETWORK OF THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS, INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE, FUND RATINGS ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTIES SUCH AS MORNINGSTAR, THE

VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED, CONVENIENCE TO THE INVESTOR,

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION CAMPAIGNS AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS. THE MUTUAL

FUNDS COMPETE WITH OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING FUNDS THAT HAVE NO SALES

CHARGE ("NO-LOAD" FUNDS), FUNDS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH INDEPENDENT BROKERAGE FIRMS

AND EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS.

THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND

2003 WAS A CHALLENGING YEAR IN WHICH THERE WAS AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN AEFA'S

INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (EXCLUDING THE THREADNEEDLE ACQUISITION).

AEAMG AND ITS AFFILIATES MUST COMPETE AGAINST A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF LARGER

FIRMS IN SEEKING TO ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. COMPETITIVE

FACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCLUDE FEES, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING THE

QUALITY AND "TRACK RECORD" OF PORTFOLIO MANAGERS, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES, RANGE OF

PORTFOLIOS OFFERED AND CLIENT SERVICE.

AEFA ALSO FACES INTENSE COMPETITION IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES. ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL DEPEND UPON ITS

ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SKILLED AND HIGH PERFORMING ASSET MANAGEMENT

PROFESSIONALS.

THE BUSINESS CLIMATE FOR RETIREMENT SERVICES IS ALSO HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

AERS COMPETES AGAINST A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF LARGER FIRMS IN SEEKING TO ACQUIRE

AND MAINTAIN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS

INCLUDE FEES, RECORD KEEPING AND TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES, INVESTMENT

PERFORMANCE AND CLIENT SERVICING. DUE IN PART TO FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS,

AERS'S ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND ASSETS ADMINISTERED IN THE RETIREMENT

SERVICES BUSINESS INCREASED BY 14% AND 30%, RESPECTIVELY, OVER 2002.

REGULATION OF RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND ASSET MANAGEMENT

AEFA'S RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES ARE REGULATED BY

THE SEC, NASD, THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, THE NATIONAL FUTURES

ASSOCIATION AND STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS. AEFA HAS EXPERIENCED, AND BELIEVES

IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO, INCREASED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF THE

SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES INDUSTRIES AT ALL LEVELS. IN

38

ADDITION, THE SEC AND NASD HEIGHTENED APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS FOR AND CONTINUED

SCRUTINY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS

GENERALLY, AS WELL AS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROCEDURES FOR AND OVERSIGHT OF

RECENTLY ADOPTED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING BOOKS AND RECORDS, BUSINESS

CONTINUATION PLANNING AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING. THE SEC AND NASD ALSO RECENTLY

ADOPTED REVISIONS TO VARIOUS ADVERTISING RULES FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES AND

BROKER DEALERS, NEW PROXY RULES AND OTHER COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR INVESTMENT

ADVISERS AND INVESTMENT COMPANIES, INCLUDING A REQUIREMENT TO APPOINT A SEPARATE

CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER.

AETC IS PRIMARILY REGULATED BY THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

(BANKING DIVISION), AND AS SUCH, IS SUBJECT TO NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER

MINNESOTA LAW. AETC MAY NOT ACCEPT DEPOSITS OR MAKE PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL

LOANS. AS A PROVIDER OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS

AND IRAS, CERTAIN ASPECTS OF AEFA'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE ACTIVITIES OF AETC,

FALL WITHIN THE COMPLIANCE OVERSIGHT OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ("DOL") AND

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY ("TREASURY"), PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 ("ERISA") AND THE TAX REPORTING

REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO SUCH ACCOUNTS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ADDS TO THE COST

AND COMPLEXITY OF OPERATING AEFA'S BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE SEC, DOL,

TREASURY, SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS AND STATE SECURITIES AND INSURANCE

REGULATORS MAY CONDUCT PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS,

WHICH MAY RESULT IN CENSURE, FINE, THE ISSUANCE OF CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS OR

SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION OF A BROKER-DEALER OR AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ITS

OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES. INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS ALSO CAN BRING COMPLAINTS AGAINST

AEFA. BECAUSE AEFA IS STRUCTURED AS A FRANCHISE SYSTEM, IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND STATE FRANCHISE REQUIREMENTS.

AS HAS BEEN WIDELY REPORTED, THE SEC, THE NASD AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS

GENERAL HAVE BROUGHT PROCEEDINGS CHALLENGING SEVERAL MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY

PRACTICES, INCLUDING LATE TRADING, MARKET TIMING, CHARGING OF 12B-1 FEES,

DISCLOSURE OF REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS AND INAPPROPRIATE SALES OF B SHARES.

AEFA HAS RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING ITS PRACTICES AND IS

PROVIDING INFORMATION AND COOPERATING FULLY WITH THESE INQUIRIES.

IN FEBRUARY 2004 AEFA WAS ONE OF 15 FIRMS THAT SETTLED AN ENFORCEMENT

ACTION BROUGHT BY THE SEC AND THE NASD RELATING TO BREAKPOINT DISCOUNTS (WHICH

ARE VOLUME DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE TO INVESTORS WHO MAKE LARGE MUTUAL FUND

PURCHASES) PURSUANT TO WHICH AEFA AGREED TO PAY A FINE OF $3.7 MILLION AND TO

REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS TO WHOM THE FIRM FAILED TO DELIVER SUCH DISCOUNTS. THESE

AMOUNTS WERE ACCRUED BY AEFA IN 2003.

IN ADDITION, CONGRESS HAS PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND THE SEC HAS PROPOSED

AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, ADOPTED RULES RELATING TO THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY,

INCLUDING EXPENSES AND FEES, MUTUAL FUND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND DISCLOSURES TO

CUSTOMERS. WHILE THERE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES MAY ULTIMATELY BE ADOPTED, THESE

INITIATIVES COULD IMPACT MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS' RESULTS, INCLUDING

AEFA'S, IN FUTURE PERIODS.

39

INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES

INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES ARE IMPORTANT AEFA PRODUCTS. AEFA SELLS THESE

PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("IDS LIFE") AND ITS

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF AEFC, IDS LIFE IS A STOCK

LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ORGANIZED UNDER MINNESOTA LAW. IDS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY

INSURANCE COMPANY AND AMEX ASSURANCE COMPANY - SUBSIDIARIES OF AEFC - OFFER

AUTOMOTIVE, HOMEOWNERS AND AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD-RELATED INSURANCE PRODUCTS. IDS

INSURANCE COMPANY, AN ARIZONA CORPORATION ("AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE"); AMERICAN

ENTERPRISE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, AN INDIANA CORPORATION ("AMERICAN ENTERPRISE

LIFE"); AND AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION

("AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE"). IDS LIFE AND ITS FOUR INSURANCE COMPANY

SUBSIDIARIES ARE REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY IN THIS SECTION AS THE "IDS LIFE

IDS LIFE SERVES RESIDENTS OF ALL STATES EXCEPT NEW YORK AND DISTRIBUTES ITS

PRODUCTS EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH AEFA'S RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL. IDS LIFE OF NEW

YORK SERVES NEW YORK RESIDENTS AND ALSO DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS EXCLUSIVELY

THROUGH AEFA'S RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL. GENERALLY, RETAIL ADVISORS OF AEFA

OFFER ONLY IDS LIFE OR IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK VARIABLE AND FIXED ANNUITIES AND, IN

CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, VARIABLE AND FIXED ANNUITIES ISSUED BY AMERICAN

ENTERPRISE LIFE. RETAIL ADVISORS AFFILIATED WITH AEFAI DO NOT OFFER ANNUITY

PRODUCTS OF AEFA'S COMPETITORS, EXCEPT FOR ANNUITIES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR

USE IN THE SMALL EMPLOYER 401(K) MARKET ISSUED BY TWO UNAFFILIATED FIRMS. RETAIL

ADVISORS AFFILIATED WITH AEFAI MAY ALSO OFFER LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS OF AEFA'S

COMPETITORS UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES OF

SECURITIES AMERICA, INC. OFFER ANNUITIES AND INSURANCE OF MANY UNAFFILIATED

ISSUERS. AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS,

GENERALLY PERSONS HOLDING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD, OUTSIDE NEW YORK. AMERICAN

CENTURION LIFE OFFERS ONE OF ITS ANNUITIES DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN NEW YORK.

IN ADDITION, AEFA CONTINUES TO EXPAND DISTRIBUTION BY DELIVERING

PROPRIETARY INSURANCE AND ANNUITY PRODUCTS THROUGH NON-AFFILIATED

REPRESENTATIVES AND AGENTS OF THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE

OFFERED THROUGH AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE AND AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE. AMERICAN

ENTERPRISE LIFE PROVIDES FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS WITH AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND WHOLESALING SERVICES TO SUPPORT THEIR

RETAIL INSURANCE AND ANNUITY OPERATIONS. IT UNDERWRITES VARIABLE ANNUITY

CONTRACTS, FIXED ANNUITY CONTRACTS AND VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE PRIMARILY THROUGH

REGIONAL AND NATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND REGIONAL AND/OR INDEPENDENT

BROKER-DEALERS, IN ALL STATES EXCEPT NEW YORK AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. AMERICAN

CENTURION LIFE MARKETS FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITIES IN NEW YORK. AMERICAN

ENTERPRISE LIFE REMAINED COMPETITIVE DURING THE YEAR DUE TO ITS CONTINUED GROWTH

AND ATTENTION TO EXPENSE AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF ITS PRODUCT LINE. IN ADDITION,

IN RECOGNITION OF EXCELLENCE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR VARIABLE AND FIXED

ANNUITIES, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE WAS AWARDED THE 2003 KEY HONORS AWARD BY

DALBAR, INC., A RECOGNIZED INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES RESEARCH ORGANIZATION.

BUSINESS SOLD THROUGH AEFA'S RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL BY IDS LIFE AND

IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK REPRESENTS THE MAJORITY OF THE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY

BUSINESS FOR THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES. BUSINESS SOLD THROUGH THIRD PARTY

DISTRIBUTION BY AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE AND

40

AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE RANKS SECOND. BUSINESS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS BY

AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE AND AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE RANKS A DISTANT THIRD.

INSURANCE: PRODUCT FEATURES AND RISKS

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES ISSUE A WIDE RANGE OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS INCLUDING

VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE, UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE, TRADITIONAL WHOLE LIFE

INSURANCE, TRADITIONAL TERM LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE. IDS

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY AND AMEX ASSURANCE COMPANY, AFFILIATES OF

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES, OFFER PERSONAL AUTO AND HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE. THE IDS

LIFE COMPANIES ISSUE NO SHORT-DURATION LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES ISSUE ONLY NON-PARTICIPATING CONTRACTS.

VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE. IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S BIGGEST

SELLING LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. VARIABLE

LIFE INSURANCE PROVIDES LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE ALONG WITH INVESTMENT RETURNS

LINKED TO THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS THE POLICYHOLDER CHOOSES. THESE PRODUCTS

ALSO OFFER A FIXED ACCOUNT WITH A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATE

RANGING FROM 4.0% TO 4.5%. ACCORDING TO LIMRA, IDS LIFE RANKED THIRD IN VARIABLE

LIFE INSURANCE SALES ON THE BASIS OF PREMIUMS IN 2003.

IDS LIFE'S VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS INCLUDE AMERICAN EXPRESS'R'

VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE IV/AMERICAN EXPRESS'R' VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE IV -

ESTATE SERIES, WHICH ARE INDIVIDUAL FLEXIBLE PREMIUM POLICIES. THE ESTATE SERIES

POLICY IS AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH INITIAL SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF $1

MILLION OR MORE. IDS LIFE ALSO ISSUES AMERICAN EXPRESS SUCCESSION SELECT, A

FLEXIBLE PREMIUM SURVIVORSHIP POLICY THAT INSURES TWO LIVES. SUCCESSION SELECT

IS OFTEN USED FOR ESTATE PLANNING PURPOSES. FINALLY, IDS LIFE ISSUES AMERICAN

EXPRESS'R' SINGLE PREMIUM VARIABLE LIFE, AN INDIVIDUAL SINGLE PREMIUM VARIABLE

LIFE INSURANCE POLICY.

BEGINNING IN 1999 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK

REINSURED 80% OF THE MORTALITY RISK ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW SALES OF INDIVIDUAL

FLEXIBLE PREMIUM VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE. THIS MEANS THAT ON THESE PRODUCT

SALES, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ARE AT RISK FOR ONLY 20% OF EACH

POLICY'S DEATH BENEFIT FROM THE FIRST DOLLAR OF COVERAGE. BEGINNING AT THE END

OF 2002 FOR IDS LIFE AND THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 FOR IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK, THE

AMOUNT REINSURED WAS INCREASED TO 90%, WITH 10% RETAINED BY THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES. IN CONTRAST AND PRIOR TO THIS ARRANGEMENT, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF

NEW YORK GENERALLY RETAINED RISK UP TO $750,000 ON EACH INSURED LIFE AND

REINSURED ONLY THOSE AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF $750,000. GENERALLY, THE PRIOR

ARRANGEMENT LEFT IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK WITH MORE OF THE RISK FOR THE

DEATH BENEFIT THAN THE MORE RECENT PRACTICE.

UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE. IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S UNIVERSAL

LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS PROVIDE LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND CASH VALUE THAT

INCREASES BY A FIXED INTEREST RATE. THE RATE IS PERIODICALLY RESET ACCORDING TO

THE TERMS OF THE POLICY AT THE DISCRETION OF THE ISSUING COMPANY. POLICIES

ISSUED BY IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ALSO PROVIDE A GUARANTEED MINIMUM

INTEREST CREDITING RATE RANGING FROM 4% TO 5%.

41

IDS LIFE'S UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS INCLUDE LIFE PROTECTION PLUS,

LIFE PROTECTION SELECT AND LIFE PROTECTION SELECT ESTATE SERIES. THE ESTATE

SERIES POLICY IS AVAILABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS WITH INITIAL SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF $1

MILLION OR MORE.

TRADITIONAL LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS. IDS LIFE'S AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK'S

TRADITIONAL LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS INCLUDE WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE AND TERM LIFE

INSURANCE. WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE COMBINES A DEATH BENEFIT WITH A CASH VALUE THAT

GENERALLY INCREASES GRADUALLY IN AMOUNT OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS AND DOES NOT PAY

A DIVIDEND. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK HAVE SOLD VERY LITTLE TRADITIONAL

WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE IN RECENT YEARS. TERM LIFE INSURANCE PROVIDES ONLY A DEATH

BENEFIT, DOES NOT BUILD UP CASH VALUE AND DOES NOT PAY A DIVIDEND. THE

POLICYHOLDER CHOOSES THE TERM OF COVERAGE AT THE TIME OF ISSUE. DURING THE

CHOSEN TERM, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK CANNOT RAISE PREMIUM RATES EVEN

IF CLAIMS EXPERIENCE WERE TO DETERIORATE. BEGINNING IN 2001 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK HAVE REINSURED 90% OF THE

MORTALITY RISK ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW TERM INSURANCE SALES. THIS MEANS THAT ON

THESE MORE RECENT PRODUCT SALES, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ARE AT RISK

FOR ONLY 10% OF EACH POLICY'S DEATH BENEFIT FROM THE FIRST DOLLAR OF COVERAGE.

IN CONTRAST AND PRIOR TO THIS ARRANGEMENT, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK

GENERALLY RETAINED RISK UP TO $750,000 ON EACH INSURED LIFE AND REINSURED ONLY

AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF $750,000. GENERALLY, THE PRIOR ARRANGEMENT LEFT IDS LIFE

AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK WITH MORE OF THE RISK FOR THE DEATH BENEFIT THAN THE

MORE RECENT PRACTICE.

DISABILITY INCOME INSURANCE. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK ALSO ISSUE

DISABILITY INCOME ("DI") INSURANCE. DI INSURANCE PROVIDES MONTHLY BENEFITS TO

INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNABLE TO EARN INCOME AT EITHER THEIR OCCUPATION AT TIME OF

DISABILITY ("OWN OCCUPATION") OR AT ANY SUITABLE OCCUPATION ("ANY OCCUPATION").

DEPENDING UPON OCCUPATIONAL AND MEDICAL UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, APPLICANTS FOR DI

INSURANCE CAN CHOOSE "OWN OCCUPATION" AND "ANY OCCUPATION" COVERAGE FOR VARYING

BENEFIT PERIODS UP TO AGE 65. APPLICANTS MAY ALSO CHOOSE VARIOUS BENEFIT RIDERS

TO HELP THEM INTEGRATE INDIVIDUAL DI INSURANCE BENEFITS WITH SOCIAL SECURITY OR

SIMILAR BENEFIT PLANS AND TO HELP THEM PROTECT THEIR DI INSURANCE BENEFITS FROM

THE RISK OF INFLATION. IDS LIFE BELIEVES IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN THE DI

INSURANCE MARKET.

LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK NO LONGER ISSUE

LONG-TERM CARE ("LTC") INSURANCE, BUT DO RETAIN RISK ON A LARGE BLOCK OF

EXISTING CONTRACTS, 50% OF WHICH IS REINSURED BY GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL

ASSURANCE COMPANY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK

GENERALLY DISCONTINUED UNDERWRITING LTC INSURANCE. (A SMALL NUMBER OF

APPLICATIONS WERE TAKEN IN EARLY 2003.) RETAIL ADVISORS OF AEFA NOW SELL ONLY

NON-PROPRIETARY LTC INSURANCE, PRIMARILY PRODUCTS OFFERED BY GENERAL ELECTRIC

CAPITAL ASSURANCE COMPANY ("GECA") AND, IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THOSE OF OTHER

UNAFFILIATED INSURERS. IN ADDITION, IN MAY 2003, IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW

YORK BEGAN OUTSOURCING CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION TO GECA.

PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE. IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY AND

ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, AMEX ASSURANCE COMPANY, PROVIDE PERSONAL AUTO AND

HOMEOWNER'S COVERAGE TO CLIENTS IN 37 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. IDS

PROPERTY CASUALTY IS REGULATED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE FOR WISCONSIN.

AMEX ASSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH ALSO PROVIDES CERTAIN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD

RELATED INSURANCE PRODUCTS, IS REGULATED BY THE

42

COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE FOR ILLINOIS. IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY AND AMEX ASSURANCE

MARKET THROUGH ALLIANCES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AFFINITY GROUPS, SUCH AS

ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS, AND DIRECT TO AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS AND THE GENERAL

PUBLIC. IDS PROPERTY CASUALTY AND AMEX ASSURANCE HAVE A MAJOR DISTRIBUTION

AGREEMENT WITH COSTCO'S AFFILIATED INSURANCE AGENCY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003,

THIS ARRANGEMENT OFFERED AUTO INSURANCE IN 36 STATES AND HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE

IN 35 STATES TO COSTCO MEMBERS.

INSURANCE RISKS. IDS LIFE'S SALES OF INDIVIDUAL LIFE INSURANCE IN 2003, AS

MEASURED BY SCHEDULED ANNUAL PREMIUMS AND EXCLUDING LUMP SUM PREMIUMS, CONSISTED

OF 82% VARIABLE LIFE, 6% UNIVERSAL LIFE AND 12% TERM LIFE.

COMPETITIVE FACTORS APPLICABLE TO THE INSURANCE BUSINESS INCLUDE PRODUCT

FEATURES, THE INTEREST RATES CREDITED TO PRODUCTS, THE CHARGES DEDUCTED FROM THE

CASH VALUES OF SUCH PRODUCTS, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF

THE ORGANIZATION, DISTRIBUTION AND MANAGEMENT EXPENSES, CLAIMS PAYING RATINGS

AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO POLICYHOLDERS.

FOR LONG-TERM PROFITABILITY, IT IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PRICING TO

COVER INSURANCE RISKS AND TO ACCUMULATE ADEQUATE RESERVES. RESERVES ARE A

MEASURE OF THE ASSETS THAT THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES ESTIMATE ARE NEEDED TO

ADEQUATELY PROVIDE FOR FUTURE BENEFITS AND EXPENSES.

ANNUITIES: PRODUCT FEATURES AND RISKS

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES OFFER VARIABLE AND FIXED ANNUITIES TO A BROAD RANGE

OF CONSUMERS THROUGH MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. ANNUITIES MAY BE DEFERRED,

WHERE ASSETS ACCUMULATE UNTIL THE CONTRACT IS SURRENDERED, THE CONTRACT OWNER

DIES, OR THE CONTRACT OWNER BEGINS RECEIVING BENEFITS UNDER AN ANNUITY PAYOUT

OPTION; OR IMMEDIATE, WHERE PAYMENTS BEGIN WITHIN ONE YEAR OF ISSUE AND CONTINUE

FOR LIFE OR FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME.

IDS LIFE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST ISSUERS OF ANNUITIES IN THE UNITED STATES.

AS OF THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, IDS LIFE, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS,

RANKED 11TH AMONG THE TOP ANNUITY WRITERS. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES POSTED ANNUITY

CASH SALES IN 2003 OF OVER $8 BILLION, A DECREASE OF 2% ACROSS ALL DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS.

VARIABLE ANNUITIES. LIKE VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE, VARIABLE ANNUITIES

PROVIDE CONTRACT OWNERS WITH INVESTMENT RETURNS LINKED TO THE UNDERLYING

INVESTMENTS THE CONTRACT OWNER CHOOSES. THESE PRODUCTS ALSO OFFER A FIXED

ACCOUNT WITH A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATE RANGING FROM 1.5% TO

4%. ONE OF IDS LIFE'S VARIABLE ANNUITIES, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT

ADVISOR ADVANTAGE'R' VARIABLE ANNUITY, WAS THE 12TH LARGEST-SELLING ANNUITY IN

THE COUNTRY IN 2003. IN JANUARY 2004 IDS LIFE INTRODUCED AN ENHANCED VERSION OF

THIS ANNUITY NAMED AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT ADVISOR ADVANTAGE PLUS'SM'

VARIABLE ANNUITY.

FIXED ANNUITIES. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' FIXED ANNUITIES PROVIDE CASH VALUE

THAT INCREASES BY A FIXED INTEREST RATE. THE RATE IS PERIODICALLY RESET

ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AT THE DISCRETION OF THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES. THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATE

RANGING FROM 1.5% TO 4%. IN 2003, A NUMBER OF STATES ADOPTED A MODEL REGULATION

PROVIDING FOR AN INDEXED GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATE, AND A

43

NUMBER OF STATES NOW FOLLOW THIS MODEL. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES FILED A NUMBER OF

CONTRACT CHANGES TO BEGIN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE LOWER RATE GUARANTEE OFFER ON

NEW PRODUCT SALES.

ANNUITY RISKS. THE RELATIVE PROPORTION BETWEEN FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITIES

SALES IS GENERALLY DRIVEN BY THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE EQUITY AND FIXED

INCOME MARKETS. IN TIMES OF LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE IN EQUITY MARKETS, FIXED

SALES ARE GENERALLY STRONGER. IN TIMES OF SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE IN EQUITY

MARKETS, VARIABLE SALES ARE GENERALLY STRONGER. IN ADDITION, INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE IS CRITICAL TO THE PROFITABILITY OF AN ANNUITY BUSINESS.

IN PAST YEARS, INNOVATIVE FEATURES FOR ANNUITY PRODUCTS HAVE CONTINUALLY

BEEN EVOLVING. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFITS

("GMDBS") THAT PROTECT BENEFICIARIES FROM A DROP IN DEATH BENEFITS DUE TO

PERFORMANCE OF THE RELATED UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. THE STANDARD GMDB IN THE

"FLAGSHIP" ANNUITY OFFERED BY IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK IN 2003, THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT ADVISOR ADVANTAGE VARIABLE ANNUITY, PROVIDES THAT IF

THE CONTRACT OWNER AND ANNUITANT ARE AGE 80 OR YOUNGER ON THE DATE OF DEATH, THE

BENEFICIARY WILL RECEIVE THE GREATEST OF (I) THE CONTRACT VALUE, (II) PURCHASE

PAYMENTS MINUS ADJUSTED PARTIAL SURRENDERS, OR (III) THE CONTRACT VALUE AS OF

THE MOST RECENT SIXTH CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY, PLUS PURCHASE PAYMENTS AND MINUS

ADJUSTED PARTIAL SURRENDERS SINCE THAT ANNIVERSARY. UNDER THE NEW AMERICAN

EXPRESS RETIREMENT ADVISOR ADVANTAGE PLUS'SM' VARIABLE ANNUITY, THE STANDARD

GMDB PROVIDES THAT IF THE CONTRACT OWNER IS AGE 75 OR YOUNGER ON THE DATE OF

DEATH, THE BENEFICIARY WILL RECEIVE THE GREATER OF (I) THE CONTRACT VALUE LESS A

PRO RATA PORTION OF ANY RIDER FEES, OR (II) PURCHASE PAYMENTS MINUS ADJUSTED

PARTIAL SURRENDERS.

ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL GMDBS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, IDS LIFE AND IDS

LIFE OF NEW YORK CONTRACT OWNERS MAY PURCHASE A MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE DEATH

BENEFIT FOR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE. THIS DEATH BENEFIT RIDER GUARANTEES THAT THE

DEATH BENEFIT WILL NOT BE LESS THAN THE HIGHEST CONTRACT VALUE ACHIEVED ON A

CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY BEFORE THE CONTRACT OWNER REACHES THE AGE OF 81, ADJUSTED

FOR PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS. IDS LIFE CONTRACT OWNERS ALSO MAY PURCHASE AN ENHANCED

EARNINGS DEATH BENEFIT OR AN ENHANCED EARNINGS PLUS DEATH BENEFIT FOR AN

ADDITIONAL CHARGE. THESE DEATH BENEFIT RIDERS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

BENEFITS TO A BENEFICIARY TO OFFSET EXPENSES AFTER THE CONTRACT OWNER'S DEATH.

OTHER IDS LIFE COMPANIES ALSO ISSUE ANNUITY CONTRACTS WITH A VARIETY OF STANDARD

AND OPTIONAL GMDBS.

TO THE EXTENT A GMDB IS HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT ACCOUNT VALUE AT THE TIME

OF DEATH, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES INCUR A COST. FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING BEFORE

DECEMBER 16, 2003, GAAP DID NOT PRESCRIBE ADVANCE RECOGNITION OF THE PROJECTED

FUTURE NET COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GUARANTEES, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY CORRESPONDING TO THESE FUTURE OBLIGATIONS

FOR DEATH BENEFITS IN EXCESS OF ANNUITY ACCOUNT VALUE. THROUGH DECEMBER 31,

2003, THE AMOUNT PAID IN EXCESS OF CONTRACT VALUE WAS EXPENSED WHEN PAYABLE.

AMOUNTS EXPENSED IN 2003 AND 2002 WERE $32 MILLION AND $37 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. IN JULY 2003, THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTANTS ("AICPA") ISSUED STATEMENT OF POSITION 03-1, "ACCOUNTING AND

REPORTING BY INSURANCE ENTERPRISES FOR CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION

CONTRACTS AND FOR SEPARATE ACCOUNTS" ("SOP 03-1"). THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES WILL

ADOPT SOP 03-1 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 (WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY

1, 2004), AND WILL THEN BE REQUIRED BY THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES TO BEGIN TO

ESTABLISH RESERVES RELATED TO

44

GMDBS. THE IMPACT OF THAT REQUIREMENT AS WELL AS OTHER PROVISIONS OF SOP 03-1

ARE STILL SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION AND ARE CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED.

THE GENERAL ACCOUNT ASSETS OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES SUPPORT THESE GMDBS

(SEE "THE GENERAL ACCOUNTS" BELOW). THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES BEAR THE RISK THAT

PROTRACTED UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD RESULT IN GMDBS

BEING HIGHER THAN WHAT CURRENT ACCOUNT VALUES WOULD SUPPORT. ACTUAL EXPERIENCE

MAY DIFFER FROM THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' ESTIMATES. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES'

EXPOSURE TO RISK FROM THESE GUARANTEES GENERALLY WILL INCREASE WHEN EQUITY

MARKETS DECLINE.

THE GENERAL ACCOUNTS

ASSETS SUPPORTING CONTRACT VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH FIXED ACCOUNT LIFE

INSURANCE AND ANNUITY PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH FIXED ACCOUNT

OPTIONS UNDER VARIABLE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY PRODUCTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "FIXED

ACCOUNTS"), ARE PART OF EACH IDS LIFE COMPANY'S "GENERAL ACCOUNT." UNDER FIXED

ACCOUNTS, EACH IDS LIFE COMPANY BEARS THE INVESTMENT RISK. IN INVESTING THEIR

GENERAL ACCOUNT ASSETS, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES SEEK TO MAINTAIN A DEPENDABLE AND

TARGETED DIFFERENCE OR "SPREAD" BETWEEN THE INTEREST RATE EARNED ON GENERAL

ACCOUNT ASSETS AND THE INTEREST RATE THE IDS LIFE COMPANY CREDITS TO CONTRACT

OWNERS' FIXED ACCOUNTS. THIS SPREAD IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF NET INCOME FOR THE IDS

LIFE COMPANIES.

THE GENERAL ACCOUNT ASSETS ALSO INCLUDE FUNDS ACCUMULATED THROUGH INSURANCE

PREMIUMS AND COST OF INSURANCE AND ANNUITY PRODUCT CHARGES. THESE PREMIUMS AND

CHARGES ARE MAJOR SOURCES OF REVENUE FOR IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK.

IN THE GENERAL ACCOUNT, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES PRIMARILY INVEST IN FIXED

INCOME SECURITIES OVER A BROAD RANGE OF MATURITIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING

A TARGETED RATE OF RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENTS WHILE CONTROLLING RISK. THE

MAJORITY OF THESE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS SUCH

AS GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, MORTGAGE BACKED OBLIGATIONS AND VARIOUS CORPORATE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES DO NOT INVEST IN SECURITIES TO GENERATE

TRADING PROFITS.

EACH OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES, THROUGH THEIR RESPECTIVE BOARDS OF

DIRECTORS' INVESTMENT COMMITTEES OR STAFF FUNCTIONS, REVIEWS MODELS PROJECTING

DIFFERENT INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, RISK/RETURN MEASURES, AND THEIR EFFECT ON

PROFITABILITY. THEY ALSO REVIEW THE DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO BY

TYPE AND CREDIT RISK SECTOR. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO STRUCTURE THE INVESTMENT

SECURITY PORTFOLIO BASED UPON THE TYPE AND EXPECTED BEHAVIOR OF PRODUCTS IN THE

LIABILITY PORTFOLIO TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND ACHIEVE TARGETED LEVELS

OF PROFITABILITY WITHIN DEFINED RISK PARAMETERS.

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES HAVE THE DISCRETION TO SET THE RATE OF INTEREST

CREDITED TO CONTRACT OWNERS' ACCOUNTS. HOWEVER, THIS DISCRETION IS LIMITED BY

THE CONTRACT'S GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST CREDITING RATE. PRIOR TO 2003, THIS

RATE VARIED AMONG FIXED ACCOUNTS AND WAS AS LOW AS 3% AND AS HIGH AS 5%. TO THE

EXTENT THE YIELD ON IDS LIFE COMPANIES' INVESTED GENERAL ACCOUNT ASSET PORTFOLIO

DECLINES BELOW ITS TARGET SPREAD PLUS THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE, THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' PROFITABILITY WOULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

45

THE INTEREST RATES CREDITED TO CONTRACT OWNERS' FIXED ACCOUNTS ARE

GENERALLY RESET AT SHORTER INTERVALS THAN THE MATURITY OF UNDERLYING

INVESTMENTS. THEREFORE, MARGINS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASES IN THE

GENERAL LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES. PART OF EACH IDS LIFE COMPANY'S STRATEGY

INCLUDES THE USE OF DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATE CAPS, SWAPS AND FLOORS,

FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THESE DERIVATIVES HELP PROTECT MARGINS BY

INCREASING INVESTMENT RETURNS IF THERE IS A SUDDEN AND SEVERE RISE IN INTEREST

RATES, THEREBY MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN RATES CREDITED TO

CONTRACT OWNERS' FIXED ACCOUNTS. CONVERSELY, IN A LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT,

SUCH AS THAT EXPERIENCED RECENTLY, MARGINS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS THE

INTEREST RATES AVAILABLE ON THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' INVESTED ASSETS APPROACH

GUARANTEED MINIMUM INTEREST RATES ON THE INSURANCE OR ANNUITY CONTRACTS. THIS

NEGATIVE IMPACT MAY BE COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE

INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS ARE CALLABLE OR PREPAYABLE BY THE ISSUER AND CALLS

AND PREPAYMENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN A LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. IN

LIGHT OF THE PRESENT ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH INTEREST RATES ARE AT HISTORIC LOWS,

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES IMPOSED FIXED ACCOUNT ALLOCATION AND TRANSFER RULES FOR

NEW VARIABLE ANNUITY SALES IN THE SUMMER OF 2003.

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES SOLD APPROXIMATELY $16 BILLION OF THEIR INVESTED

ASSETS DURING THE YEAR, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY $3

BILLION IN ASSETS WERE REDEEMED DURING THE YEAR. THE CASH GENERATED BY THESE

SALES AND REDEMPTIONS HAS BEEN OR WILL BE REINVESTED.

THE VARIABLE ACCOUNTS

VARIABLE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY PRODUCTS ALSO OFFER VARIABLE ACCOUNT

INVESTMENT OPTIONS IN ADDITION TO FIXED ACCOUNT OPTIONS. UNDER VARIABLE

ACCOUNTS, CONTRACT OWNERS BEAR THE INVESTMENT RISK. THE VARIABLE ACCOUNTS ARE

REGISTERED AS UNIT INVESTMENT TRUSTS UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940.

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' MAJOR SOURCE OF REVENUE FROM THE VARIABLE INSURANCE

AND ANNUITIES IS THE FEES IT RECEIVES, INCLUDING MORTALITY AND EXPENSE FEES.

PRIOR TO 2003, THESE FEES INCLUDED INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES FOR INTERNALLY

MANAGED FUNDS. IN 2003, AEFC ASSUMED THESE DUTIES FOR THE FUNDS AND RETAINED IDS

LIFE, AND ITS NON-NEW YORK SUBSIDIARIES, TO PROVIDE UNDERLYING ADMINISTRATIVE

SERVICES. IN MARCH 2004, A SIMILAR STRUCTURE FOR THE NEW YORK SUBSIDIARIES WAS

APPROVED BY THE NEW YORK INSURANCE DEPARTMENT EFFECTIVE AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2004.

FEES PAYABLE FROM AEFC TO THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES INCLUDE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE

FEES.

GENERALLY, THE VARIABLE ACCOUNTS CONSIST OF A NUMBER OF SUBACCOUNTS, EACH

OF WHICH INVESTS IN SHARES OF A PARTICULAR FUND. CONTRACT OWNERS CAN ALLOCATE

THEIR PAYMENTS AMONG THESE VARIABLE SUBACCOUNTS. THE UNDERLYING FUNDS ARE

MANAGED BOTH BY INTERNAL AND UNAFFILIATED THIRD-PARTY MONEY MANAGERS. THESE

FUNDS INVEST IN PORTFOLIOS CONTAINING A VARIETY OF SECURITIES INCLUDING COMMON

STOCKS, BONDS, MANAGED ASSETS AND/OR SHORT-TERM SECURITIES. THE VALUE OF THE

SUBACCOUNTS FLUCTUATES WITH THE INVESTMENT RETURN OF THE FUNDS IN WHICH THE

SUBACCOUNTS INVEST.

VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES ARE "SEPARATE ACCOUNT" RATHER THAN

GENERAL ACCOUNT PRODUCTS. THIS MEANS THAT STATE INSURANCE LAW PROHIBITS CHARGING

VARIABLE ACCOUNTS WITH

46

LIABILITIES OF THE GENERAL BUSINESS. UNDER THE SUBACCOUNTS OF EACH VARIABLE

ACCOUNT, THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES CREDIT OR CHARGE INCOME, CAPITAL GAINS AND

CAPITAL LOSSES ONLY TO THAT SUBACCOUNT.

COMPETITION

THE INSURANCE BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES'

COMPETITORS CONSIST OF BOTH STOCK AND MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS

OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES' MARKETING INSURANCE PRODUCTS. AMERICAN

ENTERPRISE LIFE AND AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH MANY OTHER

INSURERS IN THE THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL.

COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE SALE OF LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS INCLUDE

COST OF INSURANCE AND OTHER CONTRACT CHARGES, THE LEVEL OF PREMIUM RATES,

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, THE LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES, FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS

FROM THIRD PARTY AGENCIES SUCH AS A. M. BEST, THE BREADTH AND QUALITY OF

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED, THE QUALITY OF UNDERWRITING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE

AND ANY ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION CAMPAIGNS.

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' ANNUITY BUSINESS COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS OTHER

INSURANCE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN BANKS, SECURITIES BROKERAGE FIRMS,

INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT MARKET

ANNUITIES, MUTUAL FUNDS AND OTHER RETIREMENT-ORIENTED PRODUCTS. COMPETITIVE

FACTORS AFFECTING THE SALE OF ANNUITIES INCLUDE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND

FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS, PRODUCT DESIGN, REPUTATION AND RECOGNITION IN THE

MARKETPLACE, DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES, LEVELS OF CHARGES AND CREDITED RATES AND

CUSTOMER SERVICE. WITH RESPECT TO VARIABLE ANNUITIES, CUSTOMERS ALSO FOCUS ON

EQUITY MARKET GUARANTEE FEATURES THAT HELP THEM INVEST IN A VOLATILE EQUITY

MARKET.

REGULATION

IDS LIFE, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE LIFE AND AMERICAN PARTNERS LIFE ARE SUBJECT

TO COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION BY THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (INSURANCE

DIVISION), THE INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, AND THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF

INSURANCE, RESPECTIVELY (COLLECTIVELY, AND WITH THE NEW YORK INSURANCE

DEPARTMENT, "DOMICILIARY REGULATORS"). AMERICAN CENTURION LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF

NEW YORK ARE REGULATED BY THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. THE LAWS

OF THE OTHER STATES IN WHICH THESE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS ALSO REGULATE SUCH

MATTERS AS THE LICENSING OF SALES PERSONNEL AND, IN SOME CASES, THE MARKETING

AND CONTENTS OF INSURANCE POLICIES AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF

SUCH REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF POLICYHOLDERS.

FINANCIAL REGULATION OF THE IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES IS EXTENSIVE. THE IDS

LIFE COMPANIES' FINANCIAL AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS INTERCOMPANY

DIVIDENDS, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY) ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO

PRE-APPROVAL AND CONTINUING EVALUATION BY THE DOMICILIARY REGULATORS.

REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL SCRUTINY OF MARKET CONDUCT PRACTICES OF INSURANCE

COMPANIES, INCLUDING SALES, MARKETING AND REPLACEMENTS OF LIFE INSURANCE AND

ANNUITIES, AGENT PRACTICES, "BONUS" ANNUITIES AND MARKET TIMING AND LATE TRADING

UNDER VARIABLE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES, INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS

AND CONTINUES TO AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH COMPANIES APPROACH VARIOUS

OPERATIONAL ISSUES, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE. VIRTUALLY ALL STATES MANDATE

47

PARTICIPATION IN INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATIONS, WHICH ASSESS INSURANCE

COMPANIES IN ORDER TO FUND CLAIMS OF CONTRACT OWNERS OF INSOLVENT INSURANCE

COMPANIES.

ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL, THERE IS PERIODIC INTEREST IN ENACTING NEW

REGULATIONS RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING

TAXATION OF ANNUITIES AND LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES, AS

WELL AS THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF GENDER, WITH RESPECT TO

TERMS, CONDITIONS, RATES OR BENEFITS OF AN INSURANCE CONTRACT. NEW FEDERAL

REGULATION IN ANY OF THESE AREAS COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT UPON

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

AIMED AT THE PROMOTION OF TAX-ADVANTAGED SAVINGS THROUGH LIFETIME SAVINGS

ACCOUNTS AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' SALES OF ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS IF ENACTED.

RATINGS

THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES HAD CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 OF

APPROXIMATELY $66 BILLION, BASED ON U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND HAD TOTAL CAPITAL AND SURPLUS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 OF $2.8

BILLION, ON A STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS.

IDS LIFE RECEIVES RATINGS FROM INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES. GENERALLY, ITS

FOUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT RECEIVE AN INDIVIDUAL RATING, BUT RECEIVE THE

SAME RATING AS IDS LIFE. THESE AGENCIES EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS AND

CLAIMS-PAYING ABILITY OF INSURANCE COMPANIES BASED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

FACTORS. THE RATINGS REFLECT EACH AGENCY'S ESTIMATION OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES'

ABILITY TO MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS MAKING ANNUITY PAYOUTS AND

PAYING DEATH BENEFITS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE CONTRACTS. AS SUCH, THE

RATINGS RELATE TO THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' GENERAL ACCOUNTS AND NOT TO THE

MANAGEMENT OR PERFORMANCE OF THE VARIABLE ACCOUNTS OF THE CONTRACTS.

RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO MAINTAINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES. LOWERING OF THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES' RATINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THEIR ABILITY TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS AND COULD LEAD TO

INCREASED SURRENDERS OF THEIR PRODUCTS. RATING AGENCIES CONTINUALLY REVIEW THE

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CONDITION OF INSURERS. AS OF THE END OF 2003, IDS LIFE

WAS RATED "A+" (SUPERIOR) BY A.M. BEST COMPANY, INC. AND ITS CLAIMS-PAYING

ABILITY/FINANCIAL STRENGTH WAS RATED "AA3" (EXCELLENT) BY MOODY'S INVESTORS

SERVICE, INC. (MOODY'S), AND "AA" (VERY STRONG) BY FITCH.

THE FOREGOING RATINGS REFLECT EACH RATING AGENCY'S OPINION OF THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' FINANCIAL STRENGTH, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY TO MEET ITS

OBLIGATIONS TO CONTRACT OWNERS. SUCH FACTORS ARE OF PRIMARY CONCERN TO CONTRACT

OWNERS, AGENTS AND INTERMEDIARIES, BUT ALSO MAY BE OF INTEREST TO INVESTORS.

RISK BASED CAPITAL

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS ("NAIC") ADOPTED RISK

BASED CAPITAL ("RBC") REQUIREMENTS FOR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE RBC

REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BE USED AS MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BY THE NAIC AND

STATES TO IDENTIFY COMPANIES THAT MERIT

48

FURTHER REGULATORY ACTION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, IDS LIFE HAD TOTAL ADJUSTED

CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION ON A STATUTORY ACCOUNTING BASIS. AS

DEFINED BY THE NAIC, TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL INCLUDES CERTAIN ASSET VALUATION

RESERVES EXCLUDED FROM THE $2.8 BILLION OF STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS

REFERRED TO ABOVE. THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, IDS LIFE'S INSURANCE

REGULATOR, REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM RBC CALLED THE

"AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL." IF TOTAL ADJUSTED CAPITAL FELL BELOW THE AUTHORIZED

CONTROL LEVEL, THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WOULD BE AUTHORIZED TO

EXERCISE MANAGEMENT CONTROL OVER IDS LIFE. FOR IDS LIFE, THE AUTHORIZED CONTROL

LEVEL CAPITAL WAS $507.1 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

IN ADDITION, IDS LIFE, LIKE OTHER LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES, IS EXPECTED TO

MAINTAIN CAPITAL AT A LEVEL ABOVE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A COMPANY TO FILE AN

ACTION PLAN WITH THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. THIS IS REFERRED TO AS

THE "COMPANY ACTION LEVEL." FOR IDS LIFE, THE COMPANY ACTION LEVEL CAPITAL WAS

$1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IDS LIFE MAINTAINS LEVELS OF RBC FAR IN EXCESS OF THE

AUTHORIZED CONTROL AND COMPANY ACTION LEVELS REQUIRED BY THE MINNESOTA

DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL MAINTAINED IN IDS LIFE IS THOUGHT

TO BE APPROPRIATE BY MANAGEMENT AND IS MORE COMMENSURATE WITH STANDARDS

NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN IDS LIFE'S RATINGS WITH THE VARIOUS CREDIT AND

CLAIMS-PAYING RATING AGENCIES.

LIABILITIES AND RESERVES

INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND RESERVES. THE LIABILITIES FOR REPORTED AND UNPAID

LIFE INSURANCE CLAIMS ARE EQUAL TO THE DEATH BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER THE

POLICIES. FOR DI INSURANCE AND LTC INSURANCE CLAIMS, UNPAID CLAIM LIABILITIES

ARE EQUAL TO BENEFIT AMOUNTS DUE AND ACCRUED. FOR LIFE INSURANCE, DI INSURANCE,

AND LTC INSURANCE, LIABILITIES FOR INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED CLAIMS ARE

ESTIMATED BASED ON PERIODIC ANALYSIS OF THE ACTUAL REPORTED HISTORICAL CLAIM

LAG. WHERE APPLICABLE, AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS (I.E., OTHER INSURERS

WHO SHARE IN THE RISK OF THE PRODUCTS THE IDS LIFE COMPANIES OFFER) ARE

SEPARATELY RECORDED AS RECEIVABLES.

THE CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES FOR DI INSURANCE AND LTC INSURANCE

ARE BASED ON THE CLAIM RESERVES. THESE RESERVES REPRESENT THE EXPENSE OF

REVIEWING CLAIMS AND MAKING BENEFIT PAYMENT DETERMINATIONS. FOR LIFE INSURANCE,

NO CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVE IS HELD.

POLICY LIABILITIES FOR FIXED AND VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE ARE

ACCUMULATION VALUES, I.E., THE AGGREGATE OF THE VALUES CONTRACT OWNERS HAVE ON

ACCOUNT. POLICY RESERVES FOR FUTURE BENEFITS ON TERM AND WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE

ARE BASED ON THE NET LEVEL PREMIUM METHOD, USING ANTICIPATED MORTALITY RATES

(THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN INSURED'S DEATH), POLICY PERSISTENCY RATES (THE LIKELIHOOD

THAT A POLICY WILL BE CONTINUED BY THE POLICYHOLDER), AND INTEREST RATES EARNED

ON THE ASSETS SUPPORTING RESERVES. ANTICIPATED MORTALITY RATES ARE BASED ON

ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY MORTALITY TABLES, WITH MODIFICATIONS BASED ON THE IDS LIFE

COMPANIES' EXPERIENCE. ANTICIPATED POLICY PERSISTENCY RATES VARY BY POLICY FORM,

ISSUE AGE AND POLICY DURATION. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK GENERALLY

ANTICIPATE PERSISTENCY RATES ON LEVEL TERM AND CASH VALUE PLANS TO BE BETTER

THAN PERSISTENCY ON YEARLY RENEWABLE TERM INSURANCE PLANS. ANTICIPATED INTEREST

RATES ON

49

ASSETS HELD TO SUPPORT RESERVES RANGE FROM 4% TO 10%, DEPENDING ON POLICY FORM,

ISSUE YEAR AND POLICY DURATION.

LIABILITIES FOR FUTURE DI INSURANCE AND LTC INSURANCE POLICY BENEFITS

INCLUDE BOTH POLICY RESERVES AND CLAIM RESERVES. IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW

YORK BASE POLICY RESERVES ON THE NET LEVEL PREMIUM METHOD, USING ANTICIPATED

MORBIDITY RATES (MEANING, CLAIM FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY), MORTALITY RATES (THE

LIKELIHOOD OF AN INSURED'S DEATH, WHICH MEANS NO DI INSURANCE OR LTC INSURANCE

BENEFITS WILL BECOME PAYABLE), POLICY PERSISTENCY RATES, AND INTEREST RATES

EARNED ON THE ASSETS SUPPORTING RESERVES. THEY BASE ANTICIPATED MORBIDITY AND

MORTALITY RATES ON ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY TABLES.

ANTICIPATED POLICY PERSISTENCY RATES VARY BY POLICY FORM, ISSUE AGE, POLICY

DURATION AND, FOR DI INSURANCE POLICIES, OCCUPATION CLASS. ANTICIPATED INTEREST

RATES ON ASSETS SUPPORTING DI POLICY RESERVES ARE 7.5% AT POLICY ISSUE AND GRADE

TO 5% OVER FIVE YEARS. ANTICIPATED INTEREST RATES ON ASSETS SUPPORTING LTC

POLICY RESERVES ARE CURRENTLY 5.9% AND GRADE UP TO 8.9% OVER 30 YEARS.

IDS LIFE AND IDS LIFE OF NEW YORK CALCULATE CLAIM RESERVES FOR DI INSURANCE

AND LTC INSURANCE BASED ON CLAIM CONTINUANCE TABLES AND ANTICIPATED INTEREST

RATES EARNED ON ASSETS SUPPORTING THESE RESERVES. THEY BASE ANTICIPATED CLAIM

CONTINUANCE RATES ON ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY TABLES. ANTICIPATED INTEREST RATES ON

ASSETS HELD TO SUPPORT CLAIM RESERVES FOR BOTH DI INSURANCE AND LTC INSURANCE

RANGE FROM 5% TO 8%, WITH AN AVERAGE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 5.7%.

ANNUITY LIABILITIES. LIABILITIES FOR FIXED AND VARIABLE DEFERRED ANNUITIES

ARE ACCUMULATION VALUES, I.E., THE AGGREGATE OF THE VALUES CONTRACT OWNERS HAVE

ON ACCOUNT.

LIABILITIES FOR FIXED ANNUITIES IN A BENEFIT OR "PAYOUT" STATUS ARE BASED

ON ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY MORTALITY TABLES AND INTEREST RATES ESTABLISHED IN THE

YEAR OF ISSUE OR COMMENCEMENT OF PAYOUT. THE LATTER RANGE FROM 4.6% TO 9.5%,

WITH AN AVERAGE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 6.3%.

DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

THE IDS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS REPRESENT THE

COSTS OF ACQUIRING NEW BUSINESS, PRINCIPALLY DIRECT SALES COMMISSIONS AND OTHER

DISTRIBUTION AND UNDERWRITING COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED ON THE SALE OF

ANNUITY AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS. FOR THESE PRODUCTS, DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

ARE AMORTIZED OVER PERIODS APPROXIMATING THE LIVES OF THE BUSINESS, GENERALLY AS

A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUMS OR ESTIMATED GROSS PROFITS OR AS A PORTION OF THE

INTEREST MARGINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTS.

FOR A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS, SEE PAGES 34

THROUGH 35, PAGES 62 THROUGH 63 AND PAGE 81 OF THE COMPANY'S 2003 ANNUAL REPORT,

WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

SECURITIZATION OF CERTAIN INSURANCE ASSETS

DURING 2001, AEFA PLACED A MAJORITY OF ITS RATED CDO SECURITIES AND RELATED

ACCRUED INTEREST, AS WELL AS A RELATIVELY MINOR AMOUNT OF OTHER LIQUID

SECURITIES, HAVING AN AGGREGATE BOOK VALUE OF $905 MILLION, INTO A

SECURITIZATION TRUST. IN RETURN, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $120 MILLION

50

IN CASH (EXCLUDING TRANSACTION EXPENSES) RELATING TO SALES TO UNAFFILIATED

INVESTORS AND RETAINED INTERESTS IN THE TRUST WITH ALLOCATED BOOK AMOUNTS

AGGREGATING $785 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE RETAINED INTERESTS HAD A

CARRYING VALUE OF $694 MILLION, OF WHICH $512 MILLION IS CONSIDERED INVESTMENT

GRADE. NEITHER AEFA NOR THE COMPANY HAS ANY OBLIGATIONS, CONTINGENT OR

OTHERWISE, TO SUCH UNAFFILIATED INVESTORS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK

THE COMPANY'S AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK OPERATING SEGMENT ("AEB") OFFERS

PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE FINANCIAL SERVICE NEEDS OF THREE PRIMARY CLIENT GROUPS.

RETAIL CUSTOMERS, WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AEB'S

OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD., A

WHOLLY OWNED INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AEB DOES

NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES EXCEPT AS AN

INCIDENT TO ITS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION RELATING TO AEB GENERALLY DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN UNITED STATES

AND NON-UNITED STATES BASED ACTIVITIES.

AEB'S THREE PRIMARY BUSINESS LINES ARE PERSONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES ("PFS"),

THE PRIVATE BANK AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GROUP ("FIG"). PFS PROVIDES

CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC FINANCIAL NEEDS OF RETAIL

CUSTOMERS AND INCLUDES INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS, UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT,

INSTALLMENT LOANS, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, MORTGAGE LOANS, AUTO LOANS AND MUTUAL

FUNDS. THE PRIVATE BANK FOCUSES ON HIGH NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS BY PROVIDING SUCH

CUSTOMERS WITH INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, TRUST AND ESTATE PLANNING AND BANKING

SERVICES, INCLUDING SECURED LENDING. FIG PROVIDES FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS

WITH A WIDE RANGE OF CORRESPONDENT BANKING PRODUCTS INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL

PAYMENTS PROCESSING (WIRE TRANSFERS AND CHECKS), TRADE-RELATED PAYMENTS AND

FINANCING, CASH MANAGEMENT, LOANS, EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT AND INVESTMENT PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION OF AEB OFFSHORE MUTUAL FUNDS. AEB ALSO

PROVIDES TREASURY AND CAPITAL MARKET PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING FOREIGN EXCHANGE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTIONS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES AND

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS.

IN 2003 AEB NEARED COMPLETION OF ITS SHIFT IN EMPHASIS FROM CORPORATE

CLIENTS TO INDIVIDUALS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS CHANGE ALIGNS AEB'S

BUSINESSES MORE CLOSELY WITH THOSE OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER BUSINESS UNITS AND

POSITIONS IT TO PLAY A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES

ON A GLOBAL BASIS. ALSO, DURING THE YEAR, APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION OF LOANS

PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS "OTHER" WERE RECLASSIFIED TO THE CONSUMER CATEGORY.

THESE RECLASSIFIED LOANS REPRESENT NON-PFS CONSUMER LOANS THAT ARE AN ONGOING

PART OF AEB'S CONSUMER BUSINESS. BOTH THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY AND THE

RECLASSIFICATION REFERRED TO IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCES ARE REFLECTED IN THE

FOLLOWING LOAN INFORMATION: AEB REDUCED ITS CORPORATE BANKING LOANS BY $156

MILLION TO $173 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, INCREASED ITS CONSUMER AND PRIVATE

BANKING LOANS BY $558 MILLION, AND INCREASED ITS FIG LOANS BY $464 MILLION.

LOANS OUTSTANDING WORLDWIDE WERE $6.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND $5.6

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. DURING 2003, THE PRIVATE BANK CLIENT HOLDINGS ROSE

16% TO A TOTAL OF $16.2 BILLION, CLIENT VOLUMES IN PFS INCREASED 2% AND

FIG-RELATED NON-CREDIT FEE REVENUE INCREASED BY 14%.

51

AEB CONTINUED TO BROADEN ITS OFFERING OF OFFSHORE MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS

AND OTHER MANAGED PRODUCTS IN 2003. AEB'S FUND PRODUCTS ARE SOLD BY THE PRIVATE

BANK AND PFS BUSINESS LINES TO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS AND BY FIG THROUGH

DISTRIBUTORS IN SEVERAL FOREIGN MARKETS. AEB CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS NUMBER OF

THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS IN EUROPE AND ASIA. DURING 2003, AEB SIGNED MORE THAN

60 DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS IN EUROPE AND ASIA FOR THE SALE OF ITS OWN AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED PRODUCTS. AEB'S ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN ITS FUND PRODUCTS AND

RELATED MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND ADMINISTERED ASSETS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $5.3

BILLION AT YEAR-END (AS COMPARED WITH $3.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002).

IN 2003 AEB ADDED A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS AND SHARE CLASSES TO

ITS EXISTING LUXEMBOURG INVESTMENT COMPANY UMBRELLA FUND AND ITS CAYMAN

DOMICILED HEDGE FUND STRUCTURE. AEB ALSO INTRODUCED NEW INVESTMENT OPTIONS,

WHICH COMBINE STANDARD MUTUAL FUNDS, HEDGE FUNDS AND CASH PRODUCTS WITHIN A

WRAP STRUCTURE AND INCREASED THE NUMBER OF THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO

CUSTOMERS. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS OF AEB'S AFFILIATE, AEFA (WHICH

INCLUDES ITS NEWLY ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARY, THREADNEEDLE ASSET MANAGEMENT), PROVIDES

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO MANY OF THE LUXEMBOURG UMBRELLA FUND

PORTFOLIOS.

AEB ALSO CONTINUED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE COMPANY TO

CROSS-SELL A RANGE OF PAYMENT, LENDING, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SERVICE PRODUCTS

AND BUILD DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFLUENT AND PRE-AFFLUENT CONSUMER AND SMALL

BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. AEB MARKETS THE PRIVATE BANK

SERVICES TO A HIGHLY SELECTIVE GROUP OF CARDMEMBERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

AEB OFFERS CREDIT PRODUCTS SUCH AS INSTALLMENT LOANS AND REVOLVING LINES OF

CREDIT TO BOTH CARDMEMBERS AND NON-CARDMEMBERS IN GERMANY, GREECE, UNITED

KINGDOM, HONG KONG, INDIA, SINGAPORE AND TAIWAN. AEB ALSO MARKETS A WIDE RANGE

OF INVESTMENT AND SAVINGS PRODUCTS TO TRS CARDMEMBERS AND SELECT NON-CARDMEMBERS

IN GERMANY, GREECE, HONG KONG, INDIA, INDONESIA, SINGAPORE, TAIWAN AND

PHILIPPINES. AEB HAS ALSO CONTRACTED WITH AECC TO MARKET AECC'S INVESTMENT

CERTIFICATES, AND SEPARATELY OPERATES A JOINT VENTURE (AMERICAN EXPRESS

INTERNATIONAL DEPOSIT COMPANY) WITH AEFC IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS THAT ISSUES

DEPOSIT CERTIFICATES DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, EUROS, POUNDS STERLING AND

AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS.

AEB HAS A GLOBAL NETWORK WITH OFFICES IN 44 COUNTRIES. ITS WORLDWIDE

HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY. IT MAINTAINS AN INTERNATIONAL BANKING

AGENCY IN NEW YORK CITY AND FACILITY OFFICES IN SAN FRANCISCO, SAN DIEGO AND LOS

ANGELES, CALIFORNIA. ITS WHOLLY OWNED EDGE ACT SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK

INTERNATIONAL ("AEBI"), IS HEADQUARTERED IN MIAMI, FLORIDA AND HAS BRANCHES IN

NEW YORK CITY AND MIAMI.

AEB'S BUSINESS DOES NOT, AS A WHOLE, EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL

FLUCTUATIONS.

SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING AEB

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES,

AEB PROVIDES BANKING SERVICES TO THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AEB IS ONLY

ONE OF MANY INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL BANKS USED BY THE COMPANY AND ITS OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CONSTITUTE ONLY A FEW OF AEB'S

MANY CUSTOMERS.

52

AEB'S TOTAL ASSETS WERE $14.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND $13.2

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. LIQUID ASSETS, CONSISTING OF CASH AND DEPOSITS

WITH BANKS, TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS, WERE $5.4 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND $5.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT INFORMATION ABOUT AEB'S IMPAIRED (OR

NON-PERFORMING) LOANS. AEB DEFINES AN IMPAIRED LOAN AS ANY LOAN (OTHER THAN

CERTAIN SMALLER-BALANCE CONSUMER LOANS) ON WHICH THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST IS

DISCONTINUED BECAUSE THE CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST HAS BECOME

90 DAYS PAST DUE OR IF, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, THE BORROWER IS UNLIKELY TO

MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. FOR SMALLER-BALANCE CONSUMER LOANS, MANAGEMENT

ESTABLISHES RESERVES IT BELIEVES TO BE ADEQUATE TO ABSORB CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT

IN THE PORTFOLIO. GENERALLY, THESE LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF IN FULL WHEN AN

IMPAIRMENT IS DETERMINED (E.G., BORROWER'S

56

PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY) OR WHEN THE LOAN BECOMES 120 OR 180 DAYS PAST DUE,

DEPENDING ON LOAN TYPE.

KONG. THE PROVISION FOR 2001 INCLUDES A RESTRUCTURING-RELATED PROVISION OF

$26 MILLION RELATING TO THE FURTHER REDUCTION OF CORPORATE LENDING

INTEREST INCOME IS RECOGNIZED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. WHEN LOANS ARE PLACED ON

NON-PERFORMING STATUS, ALL PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST IS REVERSED

AGAINST CURRENT INTEREST INCOME. CASH RECEIPTS OF INTEREST ON NON-PERFORMING

LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED EITHER AS INTEREST INCOME OR AS A REDUCTION OF PRINCIPAL,

BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT AS TO THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF PRINCIPAL.

GENERALLY, A NON-PERFORMING LOAN MAY BE RETURNED TO PERFORMING STATUS WHEN ALL

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS DUE ARE REASONABLY ASSURED OF REPAYMENT WITHIN A REASONABLE

PERIOD AND THE BORROWER SHOWS SUSTAINED REPAYMENT PERFORMANCE, IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE LOAN OR WHEN THE LOAN HAS BECOME WELL SECURED

AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.

INTEREST-EARNING ADVANCES UNDER LINES OF CREDIT AND OTHER SIMILAR CONSUMER

LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE RESERVE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UPON REACHING

SPECIFIED CONTRACTUAL DELINQUENCY STAGES, OR EARLIER IN THE EVENT OF THE

BORROWER'S PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY OR IF THE LOAN IS OTHERWISE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE.

INTEREST INCOME ON THESE LOANS GENERALLY ACCRUES UNTIL THE LOAN IS WRITTEN OFF.

58

AEB SEPARATELY MAINTAINS AND PROVIDES FOR RESERVES RELATING TO CREDIT

LOSSES FOR LOANS, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER CREDIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS. THE RESERVE

IS ESTABLISHED BY CHARGING A PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AGAINST INCOME. THE

AMOUNT CHARGED TO INCOME IS BASED UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL

CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE IN RELATION TO OUTSTANDING CREDITS, A CONTINUOUS

ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF EACH CREDIT, AND MANAGEMENT EVALUATION OF

EXPOSURES IN EACH APPLICABLE COUNTRY AS RELATED TO CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY OF

THE RESERVE IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE, AS SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED.

AMOUNTS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE ARE CHARGED AGAINST THE RESERVE AND SUBSEQUENT

RECOVERIES, IF ANY, ARE CREDITED TO THE RESERVE.

THE RESERVE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO LOANS IS REPORTED AS A REDUCTION

OF LOANS. THE RESERVE RELATED TO DERIVATIVES IS REPORTED AS A REDUCTION OF

TRADING ASSETS AND THE RESERVE RELATED TO OTHER CREDIT-RELATED COMMITMENTS IS

REPORTED IN OTHER LIABILITIES.

RISKS

THE GLOBAL NATURE OF AEB'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IS SUCH THAT CONCENTRATIONS

OF CREDIT TO PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS ARE NOT UNUSUAL. AEB

CONTINUALLY MONITORS AND ACTIVELY MANAGES ITS CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS TO REDUCE

THE ASSOCIATED RISK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AEB HAD SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN

CERTAIN ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY

REPRESENTED BY DEPOSITS WITH BANKS, SECURITIES, LOANS, FORWARD CONTRACTS,

CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT (STANDBY AND COMMERCIAL) AND

GUARANTEES. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WERE PRIMARILY

UNRELATED TO AEB, AND PRINCIPALLY CONSISTED OF CONSUMERS TO WHOM AEB HAS

EXTENDED LOANS, BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND VARIOUS COMMERCIAL

AND INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OPERATING

GEOGRAPHICALLY WITHIN THE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION, EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA, LATIN

AMERICA, THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT AND MIDDLE EAST/AFRICA.

DURING LATE 2001 AND 2002, THE HONG KONG MARKET EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT

INCREASE IN BANKRUPTCY FILINGS DUE TO AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND CHANGES IN HONG

KONG LAW REGARDING PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY. ACCORDINGLY, DURING 2002 AEB

SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED ITS PROVISION FOR CONSUMER LOAN LOSSES IN ITS PFS

BUSINESS TO REFLECT THE EXPECTATION OF HIGHER BANKRUPTCY RELATED WRITE-OFFS AND

SUSPENDED ALL NEW LOAN ORIGINATIONS IN HONG KONG. IN 2003 LOSSES IN THIS PFS

PORTFOLIO STABILIZED. AEB CONTINUES TO CLOSELY MONITOR THIS PORTFOLIO.

AEB'S EARNINGS ARE SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE

MATURITY OF LIABILITIES DOES NOT, GENERALLY, MATCH THE MATURITY OF ASSETS. AEB

INVESTS EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN HIGH GRADE FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND

MAINTAINS MANDATORY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AS REQUIRED

BY CENTRAL BANKS. AEB MONITORS AND CONTROLS INTEREST RATE RISK THROUGH A

RIGOROUS EARNINGS AT RISK PROCESS BOTH ON A COUNTRY AND GLOBAL LEVEL. AEB

MANAGES THE DURATION/MATURITY MISMATCH OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THROUGH

ADJUSTING THE DURATION/MATURITY OF ASSETS AND/OR BY USING DERIVATIVES. ON

OCCASION, AEB MAY DECIDE TO MISMATCH IN ANTICIPATION OF A CHANGE IN FUTURE

INTEREST RATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDELINES. AEB SELLS FOREIGN EXCHANGE

PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND MAY DECIDE TO TAKE PROPRIETARY TRADING

POSITIONS AS A RESULT OF THIS BUSINESS. THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK IS MANAGED AT

THE BRANCH AND GLOBAL LEVEL THROUGH A

59

RIGOROUS VALUE AT RISK PROCESS. AEB MANAGES COUNTERPARTY CREDIT EXPOSURE ON

FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES WITH A MATURITY GREATER THAN ONE

YEAR THROUGH A DYNAMIC MARK-TO-MARKET AND POTENTIAL FUTURE EXPOSURE PROCESS, IN

WHICH THE CURRENT POSITIVE FAIR VALUE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE EXPOSURE ARE

CALCULATED AND MANAGED AGAINST COUNTERPARTY LOAN EQUIVALENT LIMITS.

BECAUSE AEB CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS IN EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES AND

IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE LESS POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY STABLE THAN THE UNITED

STATES OR THOSE IN WESTERN EUROPE, ITS PRIVATE BANKING, PFS AND FIG ACTIVITIES

MAY BE SUBJECT TO GREATER CREDIT AND COMPLIANCE RISKS THAN ARE FOUND IN MORE

WELL-DEVELOPED JURISDICTIONS. AEB CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURES IN SUCH

JURISDICTIONS, AND REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS CLIENT BASE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL

LEGAL RISKS AS A RESULT OF CLIENTS' USE OF AEB'S BANKING SERVICES.

FOR A DISCUSSION RELATING TO AEB'S USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

SEE PAGE 72 UNDER THE CAPTION "RISK MANAGEMENT," AND NOTE 9 ON PAGES 93 THROUGH

95 OF THE COMPANY'S 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS OF SUCH

REPORT ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

COMPETITION

THE BANKING SERVICES OF AEB ARE SUBJECT TO VIGOROUS COMPETITION EVERYWHERE

AEB OPERATES. COMPETITORS INCLUDE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL BANKS WHOSE ASSETS

OFTEN EXCEED THOSE OF AEB, OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING CERTAIN OTHER

SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY) AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.

REGULATION

AMERICAN EXPRESS BANKING CORP. ("AEBC") IS A NEW YORK INVESTMENT COMPANY

ORGANIZED UNDER ARTICLE XII OF THE NEW YORK BANKING LAW AND IS A WHOLLY OWNED

DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. ("AEBL") IS A

WHOLLY OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF AEBC. AEBC, AEBL AND AEBL'S GLOBAL NETWORK OF

OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO CONTINUOUS SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION

BY THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING DEPARTMENT ("NYSBD") PURSUANT TO THE NEW YORK

BANKING LAW. AEBC DOES NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN BANKING ACTIVITIES.

AEBL'S BRANCHES, REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES ARE LICENSED AND

REGULATED IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE

SAME LOCAL REQUIREMENTS AS OTHER COMPETITORS THAT HAVE THE SAME LICENSE. WITHIN

THE UNITED STATES, AEBL'S NEW YORK AGENCY IS SUPERVISED AND REGULARLY EXAMINED

BY THE NYSBD. IN ADDITION, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

(THE "FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD") REGULATES, SUPERVISES AND EXAMINES AEBI AND THE

CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISES AND EXAMINES AEBL'S

SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO FACILITY OFFICES.

SINCE AEBC AND AEBL DO NOT DO BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES, EXCEPT AS AN

INCIDENT TO THEIR ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY'S

AFFILIATION WITH AEBC AND AEBL NEITHER CAUSES THE COMPANY TO BE SUBJECT TO THE

PROVISIONS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED, NOR REQUIRES IT

TO REGISTER AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE FEDERAL

60

RESERVE BOARD'S REGULATION Y. AEBC AND AEBL ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE SYSTEM, ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION BY THE FDIC, AND ARE NOT SUBJECT

TO ANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE COMPETITIVE EQUALITY BANKING ACT OF

1987 OTHER THAN ANTI-TIE-IN RULES WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES. AEBC AND AEBL ARE NOT

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT.

THE NYSBD REQUIRES AEBC, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, TO COMPLY WITH THE

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD'S RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES AND COMPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE

CONSTRAINTS APPLICABLE TO STATE-CHARTERED BANKS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE SYSTEM. PURSUANT TO THE FDIC IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991, THE FEDERAL

RESERVE BOARD, AMONG OTHER FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES, ADOPTED REGULATIONS

DEFINING LEVELS OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY. UNDER THESE REGULATIONS, A BANK IS DEEMED

TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED IF IT MAINTAINS A TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT

LEAST 6%, A TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10%, AND A LEVERAGE RATIO

OF AT LEAST 5%. BASED ON AEBC'S TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL, TOTAL RISK-BASED

CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS, AEBC IS CONSIDERED TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003.

IN RECENT YEARS U.S. AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, TOGETHER WITH

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE RAISED INCREASING CONCERNS OVER THE ABILITY OF

CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CORRUPT PERSONS TO USE GLOBAL FINANCIAL

INTERMEDIARIES TO FACILITATE MONEY LAUNDERING. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO THE USA PATRIOT ACT

(THE "PATRIOT ACT") THAT SPECIFICALLY IMPACT CERTAIN MONEY LAUNDERING PREVENTION

ACTIVITIES OF ENTITIES INVOLVED, AS AEBL IS, IN CORRESPONDENT AND PRIVATE

BANKING ACTIVITIES. AEBL HAS TAKEN STEPS AS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THESE

REGULATIONS, AND INCREASED ITS COMPLIANCE EFFORTS TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING

GENERALLY. AEBL MAY INCREASE THESE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS FURTHER REGULATIONS

EXPECTED UNDER THE USA PATRIOT ACT AS WELL AS OTHER EVOLVING SUPERVISORY

STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH AEBL DOES BUSINESS.

IN APRIL 2003 THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE "BASEL

COMMITTEE") ISSUED A FINAL CONSULTATIVE PAPER ON THE PROPOSED NEW BASEL CAPITAL

ACCORD ("NEW ACCORD"). THE NEW ACCORD PROPOSES RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES

THAT WILL REPLACE THE PREVIOUS GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE 1988.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF CENTRAL BANKS AND BANK

SUPERVISORS FROM THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND DEVELOPS BROAD

SUPERVISORY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE PRUDENTIAL SUPERVISION OF

BANKING INSTITUTIONS. THE NEW ACCORD SETS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATIONAL

RISK AND REFINES THE EXISTING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT AND MARKET RISK

EXPOSURES. THE GOAL OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE IS TO COMPLETE THE NEW ACCORD BY

MID-YEAR 2004, WITH IMPLEMENTATION TO TAKE EFFECT IN MEMBER COUNTRIES BY

YEAR-END 2006. AEBC IS MONITORING THE STATUS AND PROGRESS OF THE NEW ACCORD.

AEBC BELIEVES THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW ACCORD, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE TO

AEBC, COULD INCREASE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND RESULT IN

CHANGES TO CERTAIN OF AEBC'S INFORMATION SYSTEMS, PROCESSES AND EMPLOYEE

TRAINING.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES - TRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY,

QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE - ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON THE

61

BRAND BY EDUCATING EMPLOYEES ABOUT ITS ATTRIBUTES AND BY FURTHER INCORPORATING

THESE ATTRIBUTES INTO ITS PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS STRATEGY TO OBTAIN PATENTS FOR

ITS BUSINESSES. IN 2003, THE COMPANY FILED 65 U.S. PATENT APPLICATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS DEVOTED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO ITS GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY

PLATFORMS AND UNDERTAKEN SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO PROTECT AND MANAGE ITS

PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS AND THE DATA COLLECTED AND STORED ON SUCH SYSTEMS. IN THIS

VEIN, THE COMPANY HAS CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON WAYS TO SECURE SUCH SYSTEMS FROM

"HACKERS" AND OTHER UNAUTHORIZED USERS.

THE COMPANY USES INFORMATION ABOUT ITS CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED SERVICES. REGULATORY ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS

OF PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CONTINUES TO GROW WORLDWIDE AND IS GENERALLY

BEING DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY AND CONCOMITANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE

RAPID AND WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION AND USE OF INFORMATION.

THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT ("GLBA") BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2001. GLBA

PROVIDES FOR DISCLOSURE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION'S PRIVACY POLICIES AND

PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO "OPT OUT" OF THE INSTITUTION'S

DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES

(WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS). THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS THAT

AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS, AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE ADOPTED

SUCH LEGISLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2003 CALIFORNIA ENACTED THAT STATE'S FINANCIAL

INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE

DATA ENTRUSTED TO IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND ITS INTERNAL DATA

PROTECTION POLICIES, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY

THEFT, WHILE SEEKING TO PROPERLY COLLECT AND USE DATA TO ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS

OBJECTIVES.

THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT OF 1970 ("FCRA") REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER

CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER COMPANIES. PROVISIONS OF FCRA THAT

PREEMPT STATES FROM ENACTING LEGISLATION REGARDING THE SHARING OF CUSTOMER

INFORMATION AMONG AFFILIATES AND CERTAIN OTHER USES OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT

INFORMATION WERE SET TO EXPIRE ON JANUARY 1, 2004. THE JANUARY 1, 2004

EXPIRATION DATE OF THESE PROVISIONS WAS REMOVED BY THE ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER

2003 OF THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT ("FACT ACT"). THE FACT ACT

SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDS THE FCRA TO MAKE THE EXCHANGE OF CONSUMER INFORMATION AMONG

AFFILIATES, TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER ACTIVITIES INVOLVING CONSUMER CREDIT

REPORT INFORMATION, SUBJECT TO ONLY FEDERAL LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, THE FACT ACT

REQUIRES ANY COMPANY THAT RECEIVES INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN

AFFILIATE TO PERMIT THE CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM HAVING THAT INFORMATION USED TO

MARKET THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER.

THE FACT ACT FURTHER AMENDS FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW PROVISIONS DESIGNED

TO PREVENT OR MITIGATE IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CONSUMER

CREDIT INFORMATION. NEW DUTIES ARE IMPOSED ON BOTH CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES

AND ON BUSINESSES THAT FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CONSUMER CREDIT

REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FURNISHER OF INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT

PROCEDURES TO PREVENT THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE

RESULT OF IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO, IF A CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY OF

INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A

62

CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, THE FURNISHER OF THAT INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN

INVESTIGATION AND RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A TIMELY FASHION. THE FACT ACT ALSO

REQUIRES GRANTORS OF CREDIT THAT USE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION TO OFFER

A BORROWER CREDIT ON TERMS THAT ARE "MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE" THAN THE TERMS

OFFERED TO MOST OF THE LENDER'S OTHER CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE BORROWER THAT THE

TERMS ARE BASED ON A CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT AND THAT THE BORROWER IS ENTITLED TO

RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE

EFFECTIVE DATES AND IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS FOR MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE

FACT ACT ARE EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED BY VARIOUS FEDERAL REGULATORY AGENCIES DURING

2004. THE FACT ACT AND THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE

PERSONALIZED SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE PATRIOT ACT WAS ENACTED IN OCTOBER 2001 IN THE

WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11TH TERRORIST ATTACKS. THE PATRIOT ACT CONTAINS A WIDE

VARIETY OF PROVISIONS AIMED AT FIGHTING TERRORISM, INCLUDING PROVISIONS AIMED

AT IMPEDING TERRORISTS' ABILITY TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN SUPPORT OF

TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PATRIOT ACT DIRECTS FEDERAL

REGULATORS, LED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS

OR TAKE OTHER STEPS TO REQUIRE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH ANTI-MONEY

LAUNDERING PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING EXPANDED REPORTING

AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS. WHILE THE

COMPANY HAS LONG MAINTAINED ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS IN ITS BUSINESSES,

THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS UNDER THE PATRIOT ACT

APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED WITHIN

AEB, TRS, AEFA AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, PRESCRIBING MINIMUM

STANDARDS FOR SUCH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS, AND THE COMPANY HAS ENHANCED

EXISTING PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED NEW ONES IN RESPONSE TO THESE

NEW REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN APRIL 2002, THE U.S. TREASURY ISSUED DRAFT

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OPERATORS OF CREDIT CARD NETWORKS (SUCH AS VISA,

MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB, DISCOVER AND AMERICAN EXPRESS) THAT WOULD REQUIRE

CREDIT CARD NETWORKS TO HAVE RISK-BASED PROGRAMS TO SCREEN INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

LICENSED TO ISSUE CARDS OR ACQUIRE TRANSACTIONS FROM MERCHANTS ON THEIR

NETWORKS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM FOR ITS

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS, AND IN 2003 COMPLETED ITS SCREENING OF ALMOST

ALL SUCH LICENSED INSTITUTIONS. IN 2004 AND BEYOND, THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

BUSINESS WILL COMPLETE ITS SCREENING OF EXISTING LICENSED INSTITUTIONS AND APPLY

THE SCREENING UNDER THIS PROGRAM TO ALL NEW LICENSING RELATIONSHIPS. THE COMPANY

HAS ALSO DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM APPLICABLE

TO MANY OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES, AND HAS ENHANCED ITS KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER AND

ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAMS IN OTHERS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO TAKE STEPS TO

COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE PROMULGATED. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY WILL TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING INITIATIVES ADOPTED

IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT CONDUCTS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING A

NUMBER OF REGULATED BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS IN EU

LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS IN THE OTHER MARKETS IN WHICH IT OPERATES, IN ORDER TO

ENSURE THAT IT IS IN A POSITION TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL

REQUIREMENTS. SIGNIFICANT EU DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE THE EU INSURANCE MEDIATION

DIRECTIVE PURSUANT TO WHICH EACH EU MEMBER STATE IS REQUIRED TO AUTHORIZE

GENERAL INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES IN ITS STATE BY MID-JANUARY 2005. SUBJECT TO

THIS AUTHORIZATION, INTERMEDIARIES WILL THEN BE PERMITTED TO CONDUCT INSURANCE

INTERMEDIATION IN OTHER MEMBER STATES VIA THE EU "PASSPORTING" REGIME. IN

ADDITION, THE EU DIRECTIVE ON THE SUPPLEMENTARY SUPERVISION

63

OF FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATES IS REQUIRED TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY EACH EU MEMBER STATE

BY JANUARY 2005. THIS DIRECTIVE CONTEMPLATES THAT CERTAIN FINANCIAL

CONGLOMERATES INVOLVED IN BANKING, INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES WILL BE

SUBJECT TO A SYSTEM OF SUPPLEMENTARY SUPERVISION AT THE LEVEL OF THE HOLDING

COMPANY CONSTITUTING THE FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATE. THE DIRECTIVE REQUIRES SUCH

FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPLEMENT MEASURES TO PREVENT

EXCESSIVE LEVERAGE AND MULTIPLE GEARING OF CAPITAL, AND TO MAINTAIN INTERNAL

CONTROL PROCESSES TO ADDRESS RISK CONCENTRATIONS AS WELL AS RISKS ARISING FROM

SIGNIFICANT INTRAGROUP TRANSACTIONS.

IN 2002, THE COMPANY OUTSOURCED MOST OF ITS TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS WORK TO

IBM. THIS ARRANGEMENT, WHICH HAS A SEVEN-YEAR TERM WITH OPTIONS TO EXTEND,

ENABLES THE COMPANY TO BENEFIT FROM IBM'S EXPERTISE WHILE LOWERING ITS

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS. IBM HAS TAKEN ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANAGING MOST

OF THE COMPANY'S DAY-TO-DAY TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING

MAINFRAME, MIDRANGE AND DESKTOP SYSTEMS; WEB HOSTING; DATABASE ADMINISTRATION;

HELP DESK SERVICES; AND DATA CENTER OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGIES

ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO RETAIN ITS CORE TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCIES, INCLUDING

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY, MANAGING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH

TECHNOLOGIES' PARTNERS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING APPLICATIONS AND DATABASES,

AND MANAGING THE TECHNOLOGIES' PORTFOLIOS OF ITS BUSINESSES.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUES FROM THE USE OF

THE CARD, TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN

COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUES TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

COMPANY'S REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SEE NOTE 18 TO THE COMPANY'S

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT, WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 104 THROUGH 106 OF

THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.) POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

IN THESE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE

PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL

CARDMEMBERS' SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY

CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN OTHER THAN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCY, AND FOR THE

REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES) CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY'S REVENUES. SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS'

CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF

THE CARD IN CONNECTION WITH SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY. THE MAJORITY OF

AEB'S REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM BUSINESS CONDUCTED IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. SOME OF THE RISKS ATTENDANT TO THOSE OPERATIONS INCLUDE CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS IN EACH

SUCH COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE

POSSIBILITY THAT, BECAUSE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR MAY BE

REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESS THAN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT

WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECORDED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE

PURCHASE BY CARDMEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE

CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A TRAVELERS

CHEQUE DENOMINATED IN A SECOND CURRENCY; FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS HELD BY AEB

AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ITS CLIENT-RELATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING

64

OPERATIONS; AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE

RISKS, UNLESS PROPERLY MONITORED AND MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S POLICY IN THIS AREA IS GENERALLY TO MONITOR CLOSELY ALL

FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS AND TO MINIMIZE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES,

FOR EXAMPLE, BY OFFSETTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY

LIABILITIES, AS IN THE CASE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE

FINANCED IN THE SAME CURRENCY. AN ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUE USED TO MANAGE EXPOSURES

IS THE SPOT AND FORWARD PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AS A HEDGE OF NET

EXPOSURES IN THOSE CURRENCIES AS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF THE CARDMEMBER AND

TRAVELERS CHEQUE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, CARDMEMBERS MAY BE

CHARGED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS FOR THEIR SPENDING OUTSIDE THEIR LOCAL COUNTRY.

THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE HEDGED BY FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS OR BY IDENTIFIABLE TRANSACTIONS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.

IMPORTANT FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

VARIOUS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS FORM 10-K ANNUAL

REPORT. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY ALSO BE MADE IN THE COMPANY'S OTHER

REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC, IN ITS PRESS RELEASES AND IN OTHER DOCUMENTS. IN

ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY THROUGH ITS MANAGEMENT MAY MAKE ORAL

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED BELOW, WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM SUCH STATEMENTS. THE WORDS "BELIEVE,"

"EXPECT," "ANTICIPATE," "OPTIMISTIC," "INTEND," "PLAN," "AIM," "WILL," "MAY,"

"SHOULD," "COULD," "WOULD," "LIKELY" AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO

IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. READERS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE

RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON

WHICH THEY ARE MADE. THE COMPANY UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE PUBLICLY OR

REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS

TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANY'S FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE, BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING.

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO.

O    SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT A BUSINESS MODEL THAT ALLOWS FOR SIGNIFICANT

EARNINGS GROWTH BASED ON REVENUE GROWTH THAT IS LOWER THAN HISTORICAL

LEVELS, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE ITS OPERATING EXPENSE TO

REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME, WHICH WILL DEPEND

IN PART ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL

INITIATIVES, AS WELL AS FACTORS IMPACTING THE COMPANY'S REVENUES;

O    GROW ITS BUSINESS AND MEET OR EXCEED ITS RETURN ON EQUITY TARGET BY

REINVESTING APPROXIMATELY 35% OF ANNUALLY GENERATED CAPITAL AND

RETURNING APPROXIMATELY 65% OF SUCH CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS, OVER

TIME, WHICH WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE

ITS CAPITAL NEEDS AND THE EFFECT OF BUSINESS MIX, ACQUISITIONS AND

RATING AGENCY REQUIREMENTS;

65

O    INCREASE INVESTMENT SPENDING, WHICH WILL DEPEND IN PART ON THE EQUITY

MARKETS, OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING REVENUES AND THE SUCCESS OF

REENGINEERING PROGRAMS, AND CAPITALIZE ON SUCH INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE

BUSINESS METRICS;

BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE CARD AND TRAVEL BUSINESSES (E.G., PERCEPTION

OF TRUST, SECURITY AND QUALITY SERVICE), TO A BROAD RANGE OF FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY;

O    MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS, MERCHANT

BANKRUPTCIES AND OTHER CREDIT EXPOSURES, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND

ABROAD, INCLUDING UNSEASONED BALANCES IN TRS' LENDING PORTFOLIOS;

O    ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN THE COMPANY'S

OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES;

O    ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN THE COMPANY'S

NOT READILY MARKETABLE;

O    SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE IN A TIMELY MANNER SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS AND

OTHER BENEFITS (TOTALING AT LEAST $1 BILLION IN THE AGGREGATE) FROM

THE REENGINEERING EFFORTS BEING IMPLEMENTED OR CONSIDERED BY THE

COMPANY, INCLUDING COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES

SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION,

OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES

OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER COST OVERSEAS

LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET TO

SAVE COSTS, THE SCALE-BACK OF CORPORATE LENDING IN CERTAIN REGIONS,

AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF SUCH REENGINEERING

ACTIONS;

O    SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND ITS ONLINE AND OFFLINE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND

CROSS-SELLING FOR FINANCIAL, TRAVEL, CARD AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMER BASE, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND

INTERNATIONALLY;

O    PARTICIPATE IN PAYMENT AND OTHER SYSTEMS MATERIAL TO ITS BUSINESSES ON

A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE BASIS;

O    CONTROL AND MANAGE OPERATING, INFRASTRUCTURE, ADVERTISING AND

PROMOTION AND OTHER EXPENSES AS BUSINESS EXPANDS OR CHANGES, INCLUDING

BALANCING THE NEED FOR LONGER TERM INVESTMENT SPENDING;

O    INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGY

AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS;

66

O    RECOVER UNDER ITS INSURANCE POLICIES FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE

SEPTEMBER 11TH TERRORIST ATTACKS;

THE COMPANY'S USE OF DESIRED BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY OR PROCESSES;

O    DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT SUCCESSFULLY ENTERPRISE-WIDE INTERACTIVE

STRATEGIES;

O    IMPROVE ONLINE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, WEB SITE PERFORMANCE AND ONLINE

AVAILABILITY FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS;

O    EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGE ITS ASSETS, SUCH AS ITS BRAND, CUSTOMERS AND

INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE IN THE INTERNET ENVIRONMENT; AND

O    ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN ALL ITS BUSINESSES.

TRS' ABILITY TO.

O    INCREASE CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON ITS CREDIT

AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES PRODUCTS, GAIN MARKET

SHARE AND DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT CAPTURE

GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS' TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON ITS

NETWORK BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS;

O    EXECUTE THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL CORPORATE SERVICES STRATEGY INCLUDING

GREATER PENETRATION OF MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES, INCREASING CAPTURE OF

NON-T&E; SPENDING THROUGH GREATER USE OF THE COMPANY'S CORPORATE

PURCHASING SOLUTIONS AND OTHER MEANS, AND FURTHER GLOBALIZING BUSINESS

CAPABILITIES;

O    MANAGE CREDIT RISK AND EXPOSURE IN A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT;

O    COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING

MODERATING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES;

O    ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE PROVISION FOR THE COST OF THE COMPANY'S

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM;

O    EXPAND THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH, IN THE CASE OF

EXPANSION IN THE UNITED STATES, WILL DEPEND ON THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME IN

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SUIT AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD CHALLENGING

THEIR RESTRICTIONS ON MEMBER BANKS' ISSUING CARDS ON THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES, AND WHICH WILL DEPEND MORE

GENERALLY ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH BUSINESS ENHANCES THE COMPANY'S

BRAND, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO LEVERAGE ITS TRANSACTION PROCESSING

SCALE, EXPANDS MERCHANT COVERAGE OF THE NETWORK OVERALL,

67

PROVIDES GNS PARTNERS WITH THE BENEFITS OF GREATER CARDMEMBER LOYALTY

AND HIGHER SPEND PER CUSTOMER, AND BENEFITS MERCHANTS THROUGH GREATER

TRANSACTION VOLUME AND ADDITIONAL HIGHER SPEND CUSTOMERS;

O    ENHANCE SIGNIFICANTLY ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, WHICH WILL DEPEND

IN PART ON ITS ABILITY TO REDUCE EXPENSES FOR REINVESTMENT IN THE

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND EXPAND THE PROPRIETARY AND THIRD

PARTY-ISSUED CARD BUSINESSES;

O    RETAIN CARDMEMBERS IN CONSUMER LENDING PRODUCTS AFTER LOW INTRODUCTORY

RATE PERIODS HAVE EXPIRED; AND

O    SUSTAIN PREMIUM DISCOUNT RATES, INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE AND REDUCE

SUPPRESSION, ALL OF WHICH WILL DEPEND IN PART ON ITS ABILITY TO

MAINTAIN A CUSTOMER BASE THAT APPEALS TO MERCHANTS AND TO DEVELOP

DEEPER MERCHANT RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

AEFA'S ABILITY TO.

O    SELL CERTAIN HIGH-YIELD INVESTMENTS AT EXPECTED VALUES AND WITHIN

ANTICIPATED TIMEFRAMES AND TO MAINTAIN ITS HIGH-YIELD PORTFOLIO AT

PRODUCTIVE NEW ADVISORS AND CREATE EFFICIENCIES IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE;

O    RESOLVE THE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS INHERENT IN ITS GROWING MULTI-CHANNEL

INSURANCE AND CERTAIN MUTUAL FUND PRODUCTS;

O    RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO FLUCTUATION IN THE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME

MARKETS, A SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL MARKET CRASH OR A LONG-TERM FINANCIAL

MARKET DECLINE OR STAGNATION, OR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF RELATIVELY LOW

OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS SOLD BY AEFA, AEFA'S ABILITY TO EARN TARGET

SPREADS ON FIXED ACCOUNT LIABILITIES, THE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT,

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF A DEBENTURE WILL BE EQUAL TO THE ORIGINAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT

OF $1,000 PER DEBENTURE INCREASED DAILY BY A YIELD, WHICH UNTIL NOVEMBER, 30,

2006 WILL BE EQUAL TO 0% PER ANNUM, AND THEREAFTER WILL BE RESET TO 1.85% PER

ANNUM; PROVIDED THAT IF A REMARKETING RESET EVENT (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) OCCURS,

THE YIELD WILL EQUAL THE RATE DETERMINED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REMARKETING OF

THE DEBENTURES UNLESS THE COMPANY ELECTS, IN CONNECTION WITH A REMARKETING, TO

HAVE THE DEBENTURES BEAR CASH INTEREST. THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO DELIVER ON

CONVERSION OF DEBENTURES, IN LIEU OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK, CASH

OR A COMBINATION OF COMMON STOCK AND CASH, PROVIDED THAT AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO

MATURITY, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT IRREVOCABLY TO PAY IN CASH THE ACCRETED

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ANY DEBENTURES SUBMITTED FOR CONVERSION PLUS ACCRUED AND

UNPAID INTEREST AS OF THE CONVERSION DATE.

IF THE DEBENTURES ARE CONVERTED BEFORE DECEMBER 1, 2006, (A) IF THE

APPLICABLE STOCK PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK (WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE

AVERAGE OF THE CLOSING SALE PRICES OF THE COMMON STOCK OVER THE TEN TRADING DAY

PERIOD STARTING ON THE THIRD TRADING DAY FOLLOWING THE CONVERSION DATE OF THE

DEBENTURES) IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO THE BASE CONVERSION PRICE, A HOLDER WILL

RECEIVE A NUMBER OF SHARES FOR EACH DEBENTURE EQUAL TO THE BASE CONVERSION RATE,

AND (B) IF THE APPLICABLE STOCK PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK IS GREATER

THAN THE BASE CONVERSION PRICE, A HOLDER WILL RECEIVE A NUMBER OF SHARES FOR

EACH DEBENTURE EQUAL TO THE BASE CONVERSION RATE PLUS AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF

SHARES BASED UPON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE APPLICABLE STOCK PRICE OF THE

COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK EXCEEDS THE BASE CONVERSION PRICE, SUBJECT TO AN

AGGREGATE LIMIT OF 22.7633 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER DEBENTURE (SUCH LIMIT

BEING SUBJECT TO THE SAME ADJUSTMENTS AS APPLY TO THE BASE CONVERSION RATE

DISCUSSED BELOW). THE BASE CONVERSION RATE IS 14.4073 SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR

(I) STOCK DIVIDENDS, (II) SUBDIVISIONS OR COMBINATIONS, OR CERTAIN

RECLASSIFICATIONS, OF THE SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK, (III)

DISTRIBUTIONS TO ALL HOLDERS OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK OF CERTAIN

RIGHTS OR WARRANTS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK, (IV)

DISTRIBUTIONS TO ALL HOLDERS OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK OF SHARES

OF THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL STOCK OR THE COMPANY'S ASSETS OR EVIDENCES OF

INDEBTEDNESS, (V) CASH DIVIDENDS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT CASH

DIVIDENDS, OR (VI) CERTAIN PAYMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH

TENDER OFFERS AND EXCHANGE OFFERS.

79

IF THE DEBENTURES ARE CONVERTED ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 1, 2006, A HOLDER WILL

RECEIVE A NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK FOR EACH DEBENTURE

EQUAL TO THE FIXED CONVERSION RATE. THE FIXED CONVERSION RATE WILL BE

ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH

ASSUMING A CONVERSION DATE THAT IS 13 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO DECEMBER 1, 2006,

AND IS SUBJECT TO THE SAME ADJUSTMENTS AS APPLY TO THE BASE CONVERSION RATE.

IF A REMARKETING RESET EVENT OCCURS, THE DEBENTURES WILL NO LONGER BE

CONVERTIBLE. OTHERWISE, THE ABILITY TO SURRENDER DEBENTURES FOR CONVERSION WILL

EXPIRE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON THEIR STATED MATURITY DATE, UNLESS THEY HAVE

PREVIOUSLY BEEN REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED. A REMARKETING RESET EVENT WILL OCCUR IF

THE AVERAGE CLOSING SALE PRICES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK OVER A TEN TRADING

DAY PERIOD ENDING ON THE TRADING DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING DECEMBER 1 OF 2006,

2008, 2013, 2018, 2023 OR 2028 IS LESS THAN THE EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE AS OF

SUCH TRADING DAY. THE EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE IS EQUAL TO THE ACCRETED

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PER DEBENTURE (INITIALLY $1,000) DIVIDED BY THE CONVERSION RATE

THEN IN EFFECT (ASSUMING A CONVERSION DATE 13 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE DATE OF

DETERMINATION).

UNLESS A REMARKETING RESET EVENT OCCURS, THE COMPANY CAN REDEEM ALL OR A

PORTION OF THE DEBENTURES AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 1, 2006 AT A PRICE

EQUAL TO 100% OF THE ACCRETED PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBENTURES TO BE REDEEMED

PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST TO BUT EXCLUDING THE REDEMPTION DATE.

THE HOLDERS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR

DEBENTURES ON DECEMBER 1 OF 2006, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2023 OR 2028 IF THE

DEBENTURES ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY CONVERTIBLE ON SUCH DATE AND A REMARKETING RESET

EVENT HAS NOT OCCURRED. THE HOLDERS MAY ALSO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE ALL

OR A PORTION OF THEIR DEBENTURES UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL. THE PURCHASE PRICE IS

EQUAL TO 100% OF THE ACCRETED PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBENTURES TO BE PURCHASED

PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST UP TO BUT EXCLUDING THE DATE OF PURCHASE.

THE COMPANY USED THE AGGREGATE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING OF DEBENTURES

FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.
