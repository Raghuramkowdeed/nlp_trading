BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (AMERICAN EXPRESS, THE COMPANY, WE, US OR OUR), IS A GLOBAL SERVICES

COMPANY THAT PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO PRODUCTS, INSIGHTS AND EXPERIENCES THAT ENRICH LIVES AND BUILD BUSINESS SUCCESS. OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CHARGE AND CREDIT PAYMENT CARD PRODUCTS AND TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES OFFERED TO

CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD.

WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1850 AS A JOINT STOCK ASSOCIATION. WE WERE INCORPORATED IN 1965

AS A NEW YORK CORPORATION. AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND ITS PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC. (TRS), ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956, AS AMENDED

(THE BHC ACT), SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE).

OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK IN LOWER MANHATTAN. WE ALSO HAVE OFFICES IN OTHER LOCATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

WE ARE PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED IN BUSINESSES COMPRISING FOUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: U.S. CARD SERVICES, INTERNATIONAL CARD

SERVICES, GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES AND GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. CORPORATE FUNCTIONS AND AUXILIARY BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP, ARE INCLUDED IN

CORPORATE & OTHER.

WE COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WITH CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS, ISSUERS

AND ACQUIRERS, AS WELL AS EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS. AS THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE ARE FACING INCREASING COMPETITION FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS THAT LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND

CUSTOMERS EXISTING CARD ACCOUNTS AND BANK RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT OR OTHER FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS. WE ARE TRANSFORMING OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES AND CREATING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR THE DIGITAL MARKETPLACE AS WE SEEK TO ENHANCE OUR

CUSTOMERS DIGITAL EXPERIENCES AND DEVELOP PLATFORMS FOR ONLINE AND MOBILE COMMERCE. EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ALSO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT HELP NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMER SEGMENTS MOVE AND MANAGE THEIR

MONEY, WHICH WE ARE PURSUING THROUGH OUR ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP.

2013 HIGHLIGHTS

OUR RESULTS FOR 2013 REFLECTED HEALTHY SPENDING GROWTH, CONTINUING STRONG CREDIT QUALITY, EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF OPERATING

EXPENSES AND A STRONG CAPITAL POSITION. COMPARED WITH 2012, WE DELIVERED.



TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE OF $33.0 BILLION, UP 4 PERCENT FROM $31.6 BILLION



NET INCOME OF $5.4 BILLION, UP 20 PERCENT FROM $4.5 BILLION

DESPITE A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, BILLED BUSINESS GREW 7 PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. OUR AVERAGE LOANS ALSO CONTINUED TO GROW

REMAINED CONSISTENTLY LOW DURING THE YEAR. WE EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED OUR EXPENSES, WHILE CONTINUING TO INVEST IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY.

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES GENERATE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF REVENUE.



DISCOUNT REVENUE, OUR LARGEST REVENUE SOURCE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES GENERALLY CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARD MEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS

AND SERVICES AT MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK



INTEREST ON LOANS, WHICH PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTS INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES

OUR GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING AND PROCESSING BUSINESSES ARE GLOBAL IN SCOPE.

WE ARE A WORLD LEADER IN PROVIDING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO CONSUMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. THESE CARDS INCLUDE CARDS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS AS WELL AS CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED BY

MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (COLLECTIVELY, CARDS). AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS PERMIT CARD MEMBERS TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT THE MILLIONS OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS

BEARING OUR LOGO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE HAD TOTAL WORLDWIDE CARDS-IN-FORCE OF 107.2 MILLION (INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES). IN 2013, OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS (SPENDING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CARDS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS $952.4 BILLION.

OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, ALTHOUGH CARD BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY

HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS. AS A RESULT, THE AMOUNT OF CARD MEMBER LOANS OUTSTANDING TENDS TO BE MODERATELY HIGHER DURING THAT QUARTER. THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE ALSO TENDS TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER DUE

TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF RETAIL-RELATED BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK AND SPEND-CENTRIC

MODEL

WE BELIEVE OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK AND SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS MODEL CONTINUE TO BE

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES BY GIVING US THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO CARD MEMBERS, MERCHANTS AND OUR CARD-ISSUING PARTNERS.

WHEREVER WE MANAGE BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS AND THE CARD-ISSUING SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A

CLOSED-LOOP, WHICH DISTINGUISHES OUR NETWORK FROM THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, IN THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD TRANSACTION. WE MAINTAIN DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH OUR CARD

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MEMBERS (AS A CARD ISSUER) AND OUR MERCHANTS (AS AN ACQUIRER), AND WE HANDLE ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. THIS ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE INFORMATION ON CARD MEMBER SPENDING AND BUILD

ALGORITHMS AND OTHER ANALYTICAL TOOLS THAT ENABLE US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING AND OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS AND SERVICES TO CARD MEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RESPECTING CARD

MEMBER PREFERENCES AND PROTECTING CARD MEMBER DATA IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE POLICIES AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

OUR

SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS MODEL FOCUSES ON GENERATING REVENUES PRIMARILY BY DRIVING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND SECONDARILY BY FINANCE CHARGES AND FEES. SPENDING ON OUR CARDS, WHICH IS HIGHER ON AVERAGE ON A PER-CARD BASIS VERSUS OUR

COMPETITORS, OFFERS GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN THE FORM OF LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND HIGHER SALES. THIS ENABLES US TO EARN DISCOUNT REVENUE THAT ALLOWS US TO INVEST IN GREATER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBERS. BECAUSE OF THE REVENUES

GENERATED FROM HAVING HIGHER-SPENDING CARD MEMBERS, WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO INVEST IN ATTRACTIVE REWARDS AND OTHER BENEFITS TO CARD MEMBERS, AS WELL AS TARGETED MARKETING AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND INVESTMENTS FOR MERCHANTS, ALL OF WHICH IN TURN

CREATE INCENTIVES FOR CARD MEMBERS TO SPEND MORE ON THEIR CARDS. THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE MAKE IN REWARDS AND OTHER COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITIONS FOR CARD MEMBERS INCENT CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBER LOYALTY.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES  TRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY, QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE  ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR BRAND, AND OUR PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES ARE EVIDENCE OF OUR COMMITMENT TO ITS ATTRIBUTES. OUR BRAND HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN RATED ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE BRANDS IN THE WORLD IN PUBLISHED STUDIES, AND WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

WE BELIEVE OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS, AND WE INVEST HEAVILY IN MANAGING, MARKETING, PROMOTING AND

PROTECTING IT. WE PLACE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS AND PATENTS, AND SEEK TO SECURE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES

THE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES (GNMS) SEGMENT OPERATES A GLOBAL PAYMENTS NETWORK THAT PROCESSES AND SETTLES

PROPRIETARY AND NON-PROPRIETARY CARD TRANSACTIONS. GNMS ACQUIRES MERCHANTS, PROVIDES POINT-OF-SALE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND LEVERAGES OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK TO OFFER MULTI-CHANNEL MARKETING PROGRAMS AND CAPABILITIES, SERVICES, AND REPORTING AND

ANALYTICAL DATA TO OUR MERCHANTS AROUND THE WORLD. IT ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY CARD ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS, LICENSING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND EXTENDING THE REACH OF THE GLOBAL NETWORK.

THE MAJORITY OF CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE ISSUED BY OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, TRS, BY THE COMPANYS U.S. BANKING

SUBSIDIARIES, AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK (CENTURION BANK) AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB (AEBFSB), AND BY OTHER OPERATING AND BANKING SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, OUR GNS BUSINESS ESTABLISHES AND

MAINTAINS RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ISSUE CARDS AND, IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, ACQUIRE LOCAL MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GNS IS KEY TO OUR STRATEGY OF BROADENING THE CARD MEMBER AND MERCHANT

BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE ACCEPTED AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS AND, DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, THEY ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED AT ATM LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT

CARDS.

OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES (GMS) BUSINESS PROVIDES US WITH ACCESS TO TRANSACTION AND MERCHANT DATA

THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, WHICH ENCOMPASSES RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THE CARD MEMBER AND THE MERCHANT. THIS CAPABILITY HELPS US ACQUIRE NEW MERCHANTS, DEEPEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING MERCHANTS, PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, AND PROVIDE TARGETED

MARKETING, ANALYTICS AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK. IN ADDITION, IT ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE TRENDS AND SPENDING PATTERNS AMONG VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE A STRATEGY, THROUGH OUR GNS BUSINESS, OF INVITING U.S. AND FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE CARDS AND,

IN SOME COUNTRIES, ACT AS MERCHANT ACQUIRERS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WE BROADEN OUR CARD MEMBER AND MERCHANT BASES FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. THIS

STRATEGY ALSO ENABLES US TO ENHANCE OUR PRESENCE IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE ALREADY DO BUSINESS AND EXPAND OUR PRESENCE INTO NEW GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AT ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. THE GNS BUSINESS HAS

ESTABLISHED 148 CARD-ISSUING AND/OR MERCHANT-ACQUIRING ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN 136 COUNTRIES. IN ASSESSING WHETHER WE SHOULD PURSUE A PROPRIETARY OR GNS STRATEGY IN A GIVEN COUNTRY, OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF, WE CONSIDER

A WIDE RANGE OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STABILITY AND ATTRACTIVENESS OF FINANCIAL RETURNS, THE SIZE OF THE AFFLUENT SEGMENT, THE STRENGTH OF AVAILABLE MARKETING AND CREDIT DATA, THE SIZE OF CO-BRAND OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW WE CAN BEST

CREATE STRONG MERCHANT VALUE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, SEE U.S. CARD SERVICES AND INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES BELOW.

IN 2013, GNS SIGNED FIVE NEW PARTNERS TO ISSUE CARDS AND/OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK,

INCLUDING NEW CARD-ISSUING PARTNERSHIPS WITH WELLS FARGO AND U.S. BANK IN THE UNITED STATES, SHANGHAI PUDONG DEVELOPMENT BANK IN CHINA, INDUSIND BANK IN INDIA AND BARCLAYCARD IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. GNS ALSO SUPPORTED EXISTING PARTNERS IN LAUNCHING

APPROXIMATELY 95 NEW PRODUCTS DURING 2013, WITH THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS PARTNER PRODUCTS STANDING AT OVER 1,200. NEW PRODUCTS LAUNCHED IN 2013 INCLUDE THE CENTURION

®

CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS ISSUED BY NEDBANK IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE TSB AVIOS CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE KB KOOKMIN GOOD DAY

PLATINUM AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CARD IN SOUTH KOREA.

GNS FOCUSES ON PARTNERING WITH QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE CARDS ACCEPTED ON OUR GLOBAL NETWORK AND/OR

ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK. ALTHOUGH WE CUSTOMIZE OUR NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS TO THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND EACH PARTNERS REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANS IN THAT MARKETPLACE, ALL GNS ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ISSUERS

DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR THEIR HIGHEST-SPENDING AND MOST AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND TO SUPPORT THE VALUE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MERCHANTS. WE CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT SHARE A CORE SET OF ATTRIBUTES COMPATIBLE WITH THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, SUCH AS COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS AND STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND WE REQUIRE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRODUCT, BRAND AND SERVICE STANDARDS.**

WITH OVER 1,200 DIFFERENT CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED ON OUR NETWORK SO FAR BY OUR PARTNERS, GNS IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT IS STRENGTHENING OUR BRAND VISIBILITY AROUND THE WORLD, DRIVING MORE

TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO OUR MERCHANT NETWORK AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS CHOOSING TO ACCEPT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. GNS ENABLES US TO EXPAND OUR NETWORKS GLOBAL PRESENCE GENERALLY WITHOUT ASSUMING ADDITIONAL CARD MEMBER CREDIT

RISK OR HAVING TO INVEST A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, AS OUR GNS PARTNERS ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED ATTRACTIVE CUSTOMER BASES TO WHOM THEY CAN TARGET AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED PRODUCTS, AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

THE CARDS THEY ISSUE. SINCE 1999, CARDS-IN-FORCE ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS HAVE GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 21 PERCENT, AND TOTALED OVER 40 MILLION CARDS AT THE END OF 2013. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF NEW

CARDS ISSUED IN 2013 WERE CARDS ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS. SPENDING ON GNS CARDS HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE OF 23 PERCENT SINCE 1999, WITH SPENDING ON THESE CARDS AT $144 BILLION IN 2013, UP 12 PERCENT FROM A YEAR AGO.

GNS ARRANGEMENTS

ALTHOUGH THE STRUCTURES AND DETAILS OF EACH OF THE GNS ARRANGEMENTS VARY, ALL OF THEM GENERATE REVENUES FOR US FROM THE CARD TRANSACTION

VOLUMES THEY DRIVE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GROSS REVENUES WE RECEIVE

**

THE USE OF THE TERM PARTNER OR PARTNERING DOES NOT MEAN OR IMPLY A FORMAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP, AND IS NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY TO ALTER THE TERMS OF

AMERICAN EXPRESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THIRD-PARTY ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PER DOLLAR SPENT ON A CARD ISSUED BY A GNS PARTNER ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE FROM OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GNS PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE

OPERATING COSTS AND RISK OF ITS CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND CREDIT LOSSES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE IN OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. THE GNS BUSINESS MODEL GENERATES AN ATTRACTIVE EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE

THAT REQUIRES A LOWER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SUPPORT. THE RETURN ON EQUITY IN OUR GNS BUSINESS CAN THUS BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE MAJORITY OF GNS COSTS ARE FIXED, THE BUSINESS IS

HIGHLY SCALABLE. GNS PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND AND DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS WITH INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.

OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS FALL INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE MAIN CATEGORIES: INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS, NETWORK CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS

AND JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS.

INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS

. THE FIRST TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS AN

INDEPENDENT OPERATOR (IO) ARRANGEMENT. AS OF THE END OF 2013, WE HAD 65 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO EXPAND THE PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT OFFER A

PROPRIETARY LOCAL CURRENCY CARD. THE PARTNERS LOCAL PRESENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS HELP US ENHANCE THE IMPACT OF OUR BRAND IN THE COUNTRY, REACH MERCHANT COVERAGE GOALS MORE QUICKLY, AND OPERATE AT ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE

DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. SUBJECT TO MEETING OUR STANDARDS, IO PARTNERS ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS IN THEIR COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CLASSIC GREEN, GOLD, PLATINUM AND CENTURION CARDS. IN ADDITION, MOST

OF THESE PARTNERS SERVE AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR FOR LOCAL MERCHANTS. AMERICAN EXPRESS RETAINS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MULTINATIONAL MERCHANTS. OUR IO PARTNERS OWN THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIT RISK FOR THE CARDS THEY ISSUE, AND

MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL BE ISSUED CARDS. GNS GENERATES REVENUES IN IO ARRANGEMENTS FROM CARD LICENSING FEES, ROYALTIES ON CARD MEMBER BILLINGS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONVERSION REVENUE, ROYALTIES ON CHARGE VOLUME AT MERCHANTS, SHARE

OF DISCOUNT REVENUE AND, IN SOME PARTNERSHIPS, ROYALTIES ON NET SPREAD REVENUE OR ROYALTIES ON CARDS-IN-FORCE. OUR IO PARTNERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, BILLING AND PRICING, CARD MEMBER AND MERCHANT SERVICING, AND FUNDING CARD

RECEIVABLES FOR THEIR CARDS AND PAYABLES FOR THEIR MERCHANTS.

WE BEAR THE CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM THE IO PARTNERS

POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. THIS EXPOSURE ARISES WHEN THEIR CARD MEMBERS MAKE PURCHASES AT MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK OR USE THE CARD FOR CASH ADVANCES AT ATMS AND WE SUBMIT SUCH TRANSACTIONS TO THE IO

PARTNER FOR SETTLEMENT. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH

US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON AN IO PARTNERS CREDIT RATING AND OTHER INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN IO PARTNER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK

GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE ENTERED INTO IO ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE

BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, CROATIA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, PERU, PORTUGAL, RUSSIA, SOUTH AFRICA, SOUTH KOREA, TURKEY AND VIETNAM. THROUGH OUR IO PARTNERSHIPS, WE BELIEVE WE CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH IN CARD MEMBER SPENDING, CARDS-IN-FORCE AND MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE

IN THESE COUNTRIES.

NETWORK CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS

. THE SECOND TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS A NETWORK CARD

LICENSE (NCL). AT THE END OF 2013, WE HAD 79 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE WORLDWIDE. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO INCREASE OUR BRAND PRESENCE AND GAIN SHARE IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE A PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING AND/OR MERCHANT

ACQUIRING BUSINESS AND, IN A FEW CASES, THOSE IN WHICH WE HAVE IO PARTNERS. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, WE GRANT THE THIRD-PARTY INSTITUTION A LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. THE NCL ISSUER OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS FOR ALL CARDS

IT ISSUES, PROVIDES CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ITS CARD MEMBERS, AUTHORIZES TRANSACTIONS, MANAGES BILLING AND CREDIT, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MARKETING THE CARDS, AND DESIGNS CARD PRODUCT FEATURES (INCLUDING REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR CARD MEMBERS),

SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS. WE OPERATE THE MERCHANT NETWORK, ROUTE AND PROCESS CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANTS POINT OF

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SALE THROUGH SUBMISSION TO THE ISSUER, AND SETTLE WITH ISSUERS. THE NCL IS THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED WITH BANKS IN AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES.

GNS REVENUES IN NCL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF CARD MEMBER SPENDING,

ROYALTIES, CURRENCY CONVERSIONS AND LICENSING FEES PAID BY THE NCL ISSUER AND FEES CHARGED TO THE NCL ISSUER BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, PLUS OUR PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SUCH AS CARD MEMBER INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER CARD FEATURES AND

BENEFITS FOR THE NCL ISSUERS CARDS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THE NCL ISSUER BEARS THE CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL AS THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION COSTS, CARD MEMBER FRAUD RISKS, AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND OTHER LOYALTY

INITIATIVES. WE BEAR THE RISK ARISING FROM THE NCL ISSUERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. THIS EXPOSURE ARISES WHEN THEIR CARD MEMBERS MAKE PURCHASES AT MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK OR USE THE CARD FOR

CASH ADVANCES AT ATMS AND WE SUBMIT SUCH TRANSACTIONS TO THE NCL PARTNER FOR SETTLEMENT. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL

HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON AN NCL ISSUERS CREDIT RATING AND OTHER INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL

HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN NCL ISSUER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

EXAMPLES OF NCL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH WELLS FARGO IN THE UNITED STATES, LLOYDS BANK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND

WESTPAC BANKING CORPORATION IN AUSTRALIA.

JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS

. THE THIRD TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS A JOINT

VENTURE (JV) ARRANGEMENT. WE HAVE UTILIZED THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT IN SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM, AS WELL AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IN THESE COUNTRIES, WE JOIN WITH A THIRD PARTY TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN WHICH WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

OWNERSHIP STAKE. THE JV TYPICALLY SIGNS NEW MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND ISSUES LOCAL AND U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED CURRENCY CARDS THAT CARRY OUR LOGO. IN A JV ARRANGEMENT, THE JV IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARD MEMBER

CREDIT RISK AND BEARS THE OPERATING AND MARKETING COSTS. UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO TYPES OF GNS ARRANGEMENTS, WE SHARE MANAGEMENT, RISK, AND PROFIT AND LOSS RESPONSIBILITY WITH OUR JV PARTNERS. INCOME IS GENERATED BY DISCOUNT REVENUES, CARD FEES AND NET

SPREAD REVENUES. THE ECONOMICS OF THE JV ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, WHICH WE DISCUSS UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES, AND WE RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE JVS INCOME DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

THE LEVEL OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST. OUR SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS OVERSEAS CREDIT CORPORATION LIMITED, PURCHASES CARD RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF THE GNS JVS FROM TIME TO TIME.

GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES

OUR GMS BUSINESS BUILDS AND MAINTAINS

RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS, PROCESSES CARD TRANSACTIONS AND SETTLES WITH MERCHANTS THAT CHOOSE TO ACCEPT CARDS FOR CARD PURCHASES (CHARGES). WE SIGN MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS AND PROVIDE MARKETING INFORMATION AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND

SERVICES TO MERCHANTS, LEVERAGING THE CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. WE ALSO OFFER POINT-OF-SALE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SUPPORT FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE, FRAUD PREVENTION AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS FOR CARD MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE CARD WHEREVER AND HOWEVER THEY DESIRE, AND TO INCREASE MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE IN KEY

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED THE CARD. WE ADD NEW MERCHANTS TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER OF SALES CHANNELS: AN IN-HOUSE SALES FORCE; THIRD-PARTY SALES AND SERVICE AGENTS; THIRD-PARTY ACQUIRERS; AGGREGATORS;

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH BANKS AND PROCESSORS; THE INTERNET; TELEMARKETING; AND INBOUND WANT TO HONOR CALLS (I.E., WHERE MERCHANTS DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE CARD CONTACT US DIRECTLY). AS DISCUSSED IN THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

SECTION, OUR IO PARTNERS AND JVS ALSO ADD NEW LOCAL MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

WE

CONTINUED EXPANDING OUR INTEGRATED AMERICAN EXPRESS ONEPOINT

®

PROGRAM IN 2013 BY ADDING THIRD-PARTY AGENTS TO

SERVICE MANY OF OUR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS IN THE UNITED STATES. UNDER THIS

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROGRAM, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE AGENTS IDENTIFY POTENTIAL NEW MERCHANTS AND PROVIDE PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES TO MERCHANTS ON OUR BEHALF FOR CARD TRANSACTIONS, WHILE WE RETAIN THE CARD ACCEPTANCE

AGREEMENT WITH PARTICIPATING MERCHANTS, DETERMINE THE MERCHANT PRICING, AND RECEIVE THE SAME TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION WE ALWAYS HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. THIS PROGRAM SIMPLIFIES CARD PROCESSING FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED

MERCHANTS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH A SINGLE SOURCE FOR STATEMENTS, SETTLEMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE HAVE SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS IN SPAIN AND MEXICO.

DURING 2013, WE ALSO LAUNCHED A PROGRAM CALLED OPTBLUE

SM

IN ORDER TO EXPAND CARD ACCEPTANCE BY U.S. SMALL MERCHANTS THAT HAVE A PROJECTED AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE VOLUME OF LESS THAN $1 MILLION PER YEAR. UNDER OPTBLUE, A THIRD-PARTY ACQUIRER OR PROCESSOR WILL

HAVE THE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT WITH THE MERCHANT AND DETERMINE THE MERCHANT PRICING. SMALL MERCHANTS WHO SIGN UP THROUGH OPTBLUE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH A SINGLE SOURCE  THE THIRD-PARTY ACQUIRER  FOR ALL THE MAJOR CARD BRANDS THE

MERCHANT CHOOSES TO ACCEPT. OPTBLUE ACQUIRERS WILL PROVIDE RELEVANT MERCHANT DATA BACK TO US SO WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR CLOSED LOOP OF TRANSACTION DATA.

GMS CONTINUES TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD IN ORDER TO ADDRESS CARD MEMBER NEEDS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE

FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE USE OF OUR CARDS FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 64 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. BILLINGS CAME FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 36 PERCENT CAME FROM RETAIL AND OTHER SECTORS. IN 2013, ONLY 26 PERCENT OF

U.S. BILLINGS CAME FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS. THIS SHIFT RESULTED, IN PART, FROM THE GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS THAT BEGAN TO ACCEPT PAYMENT CARDS IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS INCREASED DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS

FOR MORE OF THEIR PURCHASES, OUR FOCUS ON EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MEET CARD MEMBERS NEEDS, AND INCREASED COMPETITION FOR TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR SPENDING.

DURING 2013, WE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO BRING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO INDUSTRIES WHERE CASH OR CHECKS ARE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF PAYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE MADE HEADWAY IN PROMOTING CARD ACCEPTANCE IN

INDUSTRIES SUCH AS CONSTRUCTION, INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY AND INSURANCE. WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR DRIVE TO EXPAND CARD ACCEPTANCE AMONG SMALL MERCHANTS AND FOR RETAIL, EVERYDAY, ONLINE AND BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SPENDING CATEGORIES.

GLOBALLY, ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL-PURPOSE CARDS CONTINUES TO INCREASE. AS IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2013, WE CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT

ACCEPTANCE OF CARDS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO REFINE OUR APPROACH TO CALCULATING MERCHANT COVERAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE. WE ESTIMATE THAT, AS OF THE END OF 2013, OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN

90 PERCENT OF OUR CARD MEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD SPENDING. OUR INTERNATIONAL SPEND COVERAGE IS MORE LIMITED, ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR INTERNATIONAL

MERCHANT NETWORK AS A WHOLE ACCOMMODATED APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF OUR CARD MEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD SPENDING. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE BASED ON COMPARING OUR CARD MEMBERS SPENDING ON OUR NETWORK CURRENTLY WITH OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT

OUR CARD MEMBERS WOULD SPEND ON OUR NETWORK IF ALL MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT GENERAL-PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS ACCEPTED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

DISCOUNT REVENUE

WE EARN DISCOUNT REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO

MERCHANTS FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AS PAYMENT FOR GOODS OR SERVICES SOLD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT, OR DISCOUNT RATE, IS A FEE CHARGED TO THE MERCHANT FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AND IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGE AMOUNT. IN SOME INSTANCES, AN

ADDITIONAL FLAT TRANSACTION FEE IS ASSESSED AS PART OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT THAT THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER (IN MOST CASES, TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) PAYS TO A

MERCHANT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE MERCHANT, ACCEPTS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANT, PAYS THE MERCHANT FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS NETWORK, WHICH SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE CARD ISSUER. WHEN A CARD MEMBER PRESENTS THE CARD FOR PAYMENT, THE MERCHANT CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR THE TRANSACTION AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT. TO THE

EXTENT THAT TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE TIME THE TRANSACTION IS RECEIVED BY US. WE MAY

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALSO CHARGE ADDITIONAL FEES TO MERCHANTS, SUCH AS A VARIABLE FEE FOR NON-SWIPED CARD TRANSACTIONS OR FOR TRANSACTIONS USING CARDS ISSUED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND USED AT

MERCHANTS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES.

WHERE WE ACT AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE CARD PRESENTED AT A MERCHANT IS ISSUED

BY A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF OUR GNS PARTNERS, WE WILL MAKE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT TO THE MERCHANT AND RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT REVENUE. IN OUR ROLE AS THE OPERATOR OF THE CARD NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO RECEIVE

FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT FROM THE GNS CARD ISSUER, WHO RECEIVES AN ISSUER RATE (I.E., THE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AMOUNT THAT GNS CARD ISSUERS RECEIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS CHARGED ON OUR NETWORK WITH CARDS THEY ISSUE, WHICH IS USUALLY EXPRESSED AS A

PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGE AMOUNT). THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT REVENUE (RECEIVED BY US IN THE FORM OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT) AND THE ISSUER RATE RECEIVED BY THE GNS CARD ISSUER GENERATES A RETURN TO US. IN CASES WHERE AMERICAN EXPRESS IS THE

CARD ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS A THIRD PARTY (WHICH CAN BE THE CASE IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH THE IO IS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER OR IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER OUR NEW OPTBLUE PROGRAM WITH CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY MERCHANT ACQUIRERS), WE RECEIVE

AN INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED NETWORK RATE IN OUR SETTLEMENT WITH THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WHICH IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE. BY CONTRAST WITH NETWORKS SUCH AS THOSE OPERATED BY VISA INC. (VISA) AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC.

(MASTERCARD), THERE IS NO COLLECTIVELY SET INTERCHANGE RATE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND NO FEES ARE AGREED OR DUE BETWEEN THIRD-PARTY BANKS OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON THE NETWORK.

THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMS DEPICT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE PARTIES IN A POINT-OF-SALE TRANSACTION EFFECTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK

WHERE WE ACT AS BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND UNDER AN NCL ARRANGEMENT WHERE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACT AS CARD ISSUERS.

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT WE CHARGE REFLECTS THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO THE MERCHANT AND THE INVESTMENTS

WE MAKE IN PROVIDING THAT VALUE. WE DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS AS COMPARED TO OUR COMPETITORS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING BY OUR CARD MEMBERS RELATIVE TO USERS OF CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETING CARD NETWORKS, OUR

PRODUCT AND NETWORK FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY, OUR MARKETING EXPERTISE AND PROGRAMS, INFORMATION SERVICES, FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES, OUR DEDICATED CLIENT MANAGEMENT GROUP, AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ENHANCE THE MERCHANT VALUE PROPOSITIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT VARIES WITH, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE MERCHANT

DOES BUSINESS, THE MERCHANTS CHARGE VOLUME, THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT TO THE MERCHANT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF THE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH US (E.G., LOCAL OR

GLOBAL) AND THE CHARGE AMOUNT. IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, WE CHARGE A DIFFERENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR OUR PREPAID CARDS.

IN

RECENT YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SOME REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE. THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE WAS 2.51 PERCENT AND 2.52 PERCENT FOR 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. OVER TIME, CHANGES IN THE MIX OF SPENDING BY

LOCATION AND INDUSTRY, VOLUME-RELATED PRICING DISCOUNTS, STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN PRICING INITIATIVES AND OTHER FACTORS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN FURTHER EROSION OF THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENTIATED PAYMENT MODELS FROM

NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE (SUCH AS PAYPAL AND SQUARE) COULD POSE CHALLENGES TO OUR TRADITIONAL PAYMENT MODEL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE OR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR

CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK.

WHILE WE BELIEVE MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS UNDERSTAND OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT

PRICING IN RELATION TO THE VALUE PROVIDED, WE DO ENCOUNTER MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, BUT TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER TO ACCEPT ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO SUPPRESS USE OF THE CARD. OUR CARD MEMBERS VALUE THE ABILITY

TO USE THEIR CARDS WHERE AND WHEN THEY WANT TO, AND WE, THEREFORE, TAKE STEPS TO MEET OUR CARD MEMBERS EXPECTATIONS AND TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, SUBJECT TO LOCAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND

CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK) IN THE UNITED STATES. WE MAKE EFFORTS TO LIMIT CARD SUPPRESSION BY FOCUSING ON ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARD MEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD; CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE PROVIDE TO MERCHANTS

THROUGH MARKETING PROGRAMS SUCH AS OUR SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY

®

EVENT TARGETED TO ENCOURAGE CARD MEMBERS TO SHOP

AT SMALL MERCHANTS; AND PROVIDING EARLIER AND MORE FREQUENT COMMUNICATION OF OUR VALUE PROPOSITION. WE HAVE THE RIGHT, WHEN APPROPRIATE, TO TERMINATE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS WHO SEEK TO SUPPRESS THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS. WE

HAVE A CLIENT MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO GROWING OUR MERCHANTS BUSINESSES AND FINDING WAYS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS THE

MERCHANTS CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND THAT ALL MERCHANTS HAVE NUMEROUS OPTIONS GIVEN THE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NEW AND TRADITIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT. THEREFORE, WE DEDICATE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO DELIVERING

SUPERIOR AND DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR MERCHANTS.

THE LAWS OF A NUMBER OF STATES IN THE UNITED STATES

PROHIBIT THE SURCHARGING OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. CONVERSELY, THERE ARE CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN WHICH SURCHARGING IS SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE SETTLEMENT BY MASTERCARD AND VISA OF A U.S.

MERCHANT CLASS LITIGATION, WHICH RECEIVED FINAL COURT APPROVAL IN DECEMBER 2013, REQUIRED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MASTERCARD AND VISA TO PERMIT U.S. MERCHANTS, UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS, TO SURCHARGE CREDIT CARDS, WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO

CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT SURCHARGES ON DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS. WHERE PERMITTED BY LOCAL LAW, OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY INCLUDE A PROVISION UNDER WHICH THE MERCHANT AGREES NOT TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE CARD, SUCH AS BY SURCHARGING

HIGHER AMOUNTS ON PURCHASES WITH THE CARD THAN ON PURCHASES WITH ANY OTHER CARDS THE MERCHANT ACCEPTS OR BY IMPOSING A SURCHARGE ONLY ON CARD PURCHASES, BUT NOT ON PURCHASES MADE WITH OTHER CARDS. WE DO NOT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS

TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY WITH CASH, CHECK OR INTER-BANK TRANSFERS (I.E., AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE OR ACH). IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT PROHIBIT U.S. MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR IN-KIND INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY WITH PARTICULAR

FORMS OF PAYMENT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK.

IN DECEMBER 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF

U.S. MERCHANT CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS UNDER WHICH WE WOULD CHANGE OUR U.S. CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT PROVISIONS TO PERMIT MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS NO MORE THAN THE SURCHARGE ON OTHER CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARDS OR OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT THE MERCHANT ACCEPTS, OTHER THAN CASH, CHECKS, DEBIT CARDS OR INTER-BANK TRANSFERS. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE SURCHARGING IS NOT A CUSTOMER-FRIENDLY PRACTICE, THIS PROPOSED SETTLEMENT PROVIDES MERCHANTS WITH

ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY, WHILE PROTECTING OUR CARD MEMBERS AGAINST DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT AND FEES. WE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO PUT THESE CONTRACT CHANGES INTO EFFECT ANY SOONER THAN THE DATE THAT

THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT RECEIVES FINAL APPROVAL, INCLUDING ANY APPEAL PERIOD. FOR MORE DETAIL ON THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW, AND FOR INFORMATION ON THE

POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF SURCHARGING ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE 

AN INCREASING PREVALENCE OF SURCHARGING BY MERCHANTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 IN RISK FACTORS BELOW.

ENHANCING MERCHANT SATISFACTION

GMS IS FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MERCHANT SATISFACTION, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND EXECUTING PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS, USING TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES

AND INNOVATIVE MARKETING TOOLS SUCH AS SOCIAL MEDIA, AND APPLYING OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITIES AND DEEP MARKETING EXPERTISE. IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ALSO OFFER OUR MERCHANTS A FULL RANGE OF POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATED

POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS, SOFTWARE, ONLINE SOLUTIONS AND DIRECT LINKS THAT ALLOW MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS (AS WELL AS CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON OTHER NETWORKS AND CHECKS). VIRTUALLY ALL PROPRIETARY POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS

SUPPORT DIRECT PROCESSING BY (I.E., DIRECT CONNECTIVITY TO) AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH CAN LOWER A MERCHANTS COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE AND ENHANCE PAYMENT EFFICIENCY.

OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK AND RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW US TO ANALYZE MERCHANT DATA AND INFORMATION ON CARD MEMBER SPENDING. THIS ENABLES US TO OFFER A RANGE OF TARGETED MARKETING SERVICES, NETWORK CAPABILITIES

AND SPECIAL OFFERS FOR THE BENEFIT OF MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBERS THROUGH A VARIETY OF CHANNELS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF CARD MEMBER INFORMATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION

SECURITY LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS (HEREINAFTER, PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS), OUR PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, INFORMATION SECURITY AND FIREWALL POLICIES, AND OTHER APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. WE ALSO WORK

CLOSELY WITH OUR CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN THE INFORMATION THAT SUPPORTS KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS CLOSED LOOP, PROVIDING VALUE TO CARD MEMBERS AND MERCHANTS.

IN 2013, WE CONTINUED TO CONNECT MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBERS VIA OUR PROPRIETARY CARD SYNC TECHNOLOGY AND SMART OFFER APIS. WE EXPANDED

THE BENEFITS OF CONNECTING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD WITH TWITTER TO ENABLE CARD MEMBERS WHO CONNECT THEIR ELIGIBLE CARDS TO USE SPECIAL TWITTER #HASHTAGS TO MAKE PURCHASES.

WE OFFER FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES TO MERCHANTS FOR TRANSACTIONS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, AND OUR SUBSIDIARY, ACCERTIFY, INC., WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN NOVEMBER 2010, IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF

SOLUTIONS THAT HELP MERCHANTS COMBAT FRAUDULENT ONLINE AND OTHER CARD-NOT-PRESENT TRANSACTIONS. ACCERTIFY PROVIDES A HOSTED SOFTWARE APPLICATION THAT OFFERS AN EXTRA LEVEL OF SECURITY FOR TRANSACTIONS ON ANY OF THE MAJOR PAYMENT NETWORKS, INCLUDING

AMERICAN EXPRESS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DISCOVER AND PAYPAL, OR USING ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHOD. ACCERTIFY ALSO OFFERS MERCHANTS THE OPTION TO OUTSOURCE THEIR END-TO-END FRAUD MANAGEMENT PROCESS TO ACCERTIFY AND PROVIDES OTHER VALUE-ADDED

SERVICES.

WE ALSO OFFER MERCHANT FINANCING, A SET OF FINANCING PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDES QUALIFIED MERCHANTS WITH ACCESS TO A

CONVENIENT, ATTRACTIVELY PRICED SOURCE OF FINANCING FOR THEIR BUSINESS NEEDS THROUGH THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS. THE FINANCING OFFERED IS A COMMERCIAL LOAN, WHICH IS REPAID AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE MERCHANTS DAILY CHARGE

SUBMISSIONS AND ACCOMPANIED BY LOW FIXED FEES.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN AREAS THAT MAKE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE

CARD MORE SECURE AND CONVENIENT FOR MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBERS. WE PARTICIPATE IN STANDARD-SETTING BODIES, SUCH AS EMVCO AND PCI SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL, LLC, DESIGNED TO HELP DRIVE SECURE AND INTEROPERABLE PAYMENTS GLOBALLY. OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE

IT EASIER FOR MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT OUR CARDS, FOR CARD MEMBERS TO HAVE SEAMLESS EXPERIENCES AT THE POINT OF SALE, AND FOR ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS THAT HAVE MORE THAN ONE NETWORK RELATIONSHIP TO HAVE UNIFORM TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS ACROSS THEIR CARD

PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS. THESE EFFORTS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ENABLED ON CONTACTLESS CARDS, MOBILE PHONES AND NEW PAYMENT DEVICES OFFER CONSUMERS NEW, CONVENIENT WAYS TO PAY FOR THEIR PURCHASES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE OFFER A

CONTACTLESS PAYMENT FEATURE EMBEDDED IN CERTAIN CARDS, WHICH CAN PROVIDE SPEED AND CONVENIENCE FOR MAKING EVERYDAY PURCHASES WITH MERCHANTS SUCH AS TRANSPORT FOR LONDON, WHICH NOW ACCEPTS CONTACTLESS PAYMENT CARDS ON ALL OF LONDONS 8,500

BUSES. DURING

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2013, WE ANNOUNCED, ALONG WITH VISA AND MASTERCARD, A PROPOSED FRAMEWORK FOR A NEW GLOBAL STANDARD TO ENHANCE THE SECURITY OF DIGITAL PAYMENTS AND SIMPLIFY THE PURCHASING EXPERIENCE WHEN SHOPPING

ON A MOBILE PHONE, TABLET, PERSONAL COMPUTER OR OTHER SMART DEVICE BY REPLACING TRADITIONAL ACCOUNT NUMBERS WITH DIGITAL PAYMENT TOKENS FOR ONLINE AND MOBILE TRANSACTIONS. THE PROPOSED STANDARD, WHICH WILL BE DEVELOPED AND ADMINISTERED

BY EMVCO, WOULD SEEK TO REDUCE FRAUD IN THE EVOLVING PAYMENTS LANDSCAPE BY PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF SECURITY AND ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR MERCHANTS, DIGITAL WALLET OPERATORS OR OTHERS TO STORE ACCOUNT NUMBERS.

BILLING DISPUTES

AS THE

MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WE HAVE CERTAIN EXPOSURES THAT ARISE IF A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARD MEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE CARD MEMBER. DRIVERS OF THIS LIABILITY ARE RETURNS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER

FRAUDULENT CHARGES, THE QUALITY OR NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES, AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, WE OFFSET THE AMOUNT DUE TO THE CARD MEMBER AGAINST PAYMENTS FOR THE MERCHANTS CURRENT OR FUTURE CHARGE SUBMISSIONS. WE CAN REALIZE LOSSES

WHEN A MERCHANTS OFFSETTING CHARGE SUBMISSIONS CEASE, SUCH AS WHEN THE MERCHANT DECIDES TO NO LONGER ACCEPT THE CARD OR GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE RISK OF THIS EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE WILL

TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN MERCHANT BY ESTABLISHING RESERVES OF CHARGE PAYABLE HOLDBACKS FROM A MERCHANT, LENGTHENING THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE MERCHANT SUBMITS A CHARGE FOR PAYMENT AND WHEN WE PAY THE MERCHANT, REQUIRING THE

MERCHANT TO SECURE A LETTER OF CREDIT OR A PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE, OR IMPLEMENTING OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS. WE ALSO ESTABLISH RESERVES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT ACCOUNTING RULES.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  COMPETITION

OUR GLOBAL CARD NETWORK COMPETES IN THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WITH OTHER CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, VISA, MASTERCARD,

DINERS CLUB INTERNATIONAL (WHICH IS OWNED BY DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES), DISCOVER (PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES) AND JCB AND CHINA UNIONPAY (PRIMARILY IN ASIA). WE ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK ON A GLOBAL BASIS BASED ON

PURCHASE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA, MASTERCARD AND CHINA UNIONPAY. IN ADDITION TO SUCH NETWORKS, A RANGE OF COMPANIES GLOBALLY, INCLUDING MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND PROCESSORS AND COMPANIES SUCH AS PAYPAL, CARRY OUT SOME ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE PERFORMED

BY OUR GMS AND GNS BUSINESSES. NO OTHER SINGLE ENTITY ENGAGES ON A GLOBAL BASIS IN THE FULL RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ENCOMPASSED BY OUR CLOSED-LOOP BUSINESS MODEL.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK AND MERCHANT SERVICE BUSINESSES INCLUDE.



THE NUMBER OF CARDS-IN-FORCE AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THOSE CARDS



THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THE CARDS CAN BE USED



THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANTS PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK



THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS



REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION



INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT IN SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, PARTICULARLY IN ONLINE AND MOBILE COMMERCE, INCLUDING THROUGH

PARTNERSHIPS WITH LEADING COMPANIES IN THE DIGITAL SPACE



THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE



THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO PARTNERS IN AREAS SUCH AS CUSTOMER SERVICING, LOYALTY AND DATA ANALYTICS



THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER AND MERCHANT INFORMATION



THE IMPACT OF COURT ORDERS AND LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS, ONGOING LITIGATION, LEGISLATION AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANOTHER ASPECT OF NETWORK COMPETITION IS THE RECENT EMERGENCE AND RAPID GROWTH OF

ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDE AGGREGATORS (SUCH AS PAYPAL, SQUARE AND AMAZON), WIRELESS PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), ELECTRONIC WALLET PROVIDERS, PREPAID

SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS SUCH AS ACH AND WIRE TRANSFERS.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES,

TOGETHER WITH THE PORTABILITY PROVIDED BY SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND NETWORKING, ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. TRADITIONAL

AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS SUCH AS MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND AGGREGATORS ARE WORKING TO DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS. COMPETITION REMAINS FIERCE FOR CAPTURING AND MAINTAINING ONLINE

AND MOBILE SPEND IN THE EVER-INCREASING DIGITAL WORLD, AND ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS MODELS PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. FOR EXAMPLE, AGGREGATORS LIKE PAYPAL HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE PAYMENT SERVICES TO MERCHANTS FOR MULTIPLE PAYMENT NETWORKS. IN

ADDITION, NEW ENTRANTS TO THE DIGITAL PAYMENTS SPACE SUCH AS ONLINE, SOCIAL MEDIA, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES REPRESENT ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE AND POTENTIALLY DISINTERMEDIATING FACTORS IN THE CARD PAYMENT INDUSTRY GIVEN THE SCALE OF

THEIR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, LARGE CASH RESERVES AND OTHER RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP NEW PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGIES, AND THEIR STRATEGIES TO USE PAYMENTS AS A TOOL TO SUPPORT OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE.

TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, SUCH AS AGGREGATORS, CONTINUE TO EXPAND SUCCESSFULLY, DISCOUNT REVENUES AND

POTENTIALLY OTHER REVENUES, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED

ON ACH CONTINUE TO EMERGE AND GROW, MERCHANTS WITH RECURRING BILLING MODELS ACTIVELY SEEK TO SWITCH CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT THROUGH DIRECT DEBITS FROM BANK ACCOUNTS, AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND BOTH ON- AND OFF-LINE AND ARE

MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD FURTHER REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE EMERGING PAYMENTS AREA, SEE ENTERPRISE GROWTH

GROUP  COMPETITION UNDER CORPORATE & OTHER BELOW.

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO

REPLICATE OUR CLOSED-LOOP FUNCTIONALITY. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, FOR EXAMPLE, JPMORGAN CHASE ANNOUNCED IT WOULD PARTNER WITH VISA TO DEVELOP CHASE MERCHANT SERVICES. EFFORTS BY SOME CARD NETWORKS, PAYMENT PROVIDERS AND NON-TRADITIONAL

COMPETITORS TO REPLICATE THE CLOSED LOOP REFLECT BOTH ITS CONTINUED VALUE AND THE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THIRD-PARTY PROCESSORS AND SOME ACQUIRERS OFFER MERCHANTS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVERTING PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF THE

CARDHOLDERS RESIDENCE (I.E., THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE POINT-OF-SALE, AND SUBMITTING THE TRANSACTION IN THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS OF THE CARD

NETWORK. THIS PRACTICE, KNOWN AS DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION, REDUCES OR ELIMINATES REVENUE FOR CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CHARGES TO THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY. WHILE WE ARE STARTING

TO SEE MORE ACTIVITY RELATED TO THIS PRACTICE, IT IS STILL NOT WIDESPREAD. OUR POLICY GENERALLY REQUIRES MERCHANTS TO SUBMIT CHARGES AND BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND WE CONVERT THE TRANSACTION TO THE

CARD MEMBERS BILLING CURRENCY.

IN ADDITION TO THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION, SEE 

OUR OPERATING RESULTS

MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY

 IN RISK FACTORS BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF COMPETITION ON OUR BUSINESS.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  REGULATION

LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING GNS ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BECAUSE SUCH BANKS

AND INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CARDS AND, IN THE CASE OF OUR IO ARRANGEMENTS, TO OPERATE MERCHANT-ACQUIRING BUSINESSES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR GNS PARTNERS HAVE GENERALLY NOT HAD

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DIFFICULTY OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO GNS ARRANGEMENTS. AS A SERVICE PROVIDER TO REGULATED U.S. BANKS, OUR GNS

BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CERTAIN FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) AND THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC).

AS THE OPERATOR OF A GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENCY AND FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS

REPORTING ACT AND THE ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE BANK SECRECY ACT), AS AMENDED BY THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE PATRIOT ACT). WE CONDUCT DUE

DILIGENCE ON OUR GNS PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) CONTROLS TO PREVENT OUR NETWORK FROM BEING USED FOR MONEY LAUNDERING OR TERRORIST FINANCING PURPOSES. AS AGGREGATORS

AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES ADD MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR DUE DILIGENCE TO REVIEW THE AML AND KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER POLICIES AND CONTROLS OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES, AND RETAIN THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE TERMINATION

OF MERCHANTS CARD ACCEPTANCE UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. SINCE AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS ARE EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FURTHER REGULATION AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR REGULATORY STATUS, SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BELOW.

OVER THE LAST DECADE,

LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS ON CERTAIN CARD NETWORKS AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE,

AS WELL AS THE RULES AND CONTRACTS GOVERNING MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE. THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY-SET FEE PAID BY THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN FOUR-PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD, IS

GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE PAYABLE BY MERCHANTS FOR DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE SUCH INTERCHANGE FEES. FOR THIS REASON, AS WELL AS THE

FACT THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS, REGULATORY FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON SUCH FOUR-PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS. HOWEVER, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING TO MERCHANT PRICING OR TERMS OF MERCHANT

RULES AND CONTRACTS COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS AS WELL AS ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMERS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE FROM CONSUMERS SUCH AS

HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE REGULATIONS HAVE LED OUR COMPETITORS TO LOWER THEIR FEES, WE HAVE MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRICING TO MERCHANTS TO REFLECT LOCAL COMPETITIVE TRENDS. FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCTIONS IN BANKCARD INTERCHANGE MANDATED BY THE RESERVE BANK

OF AUSTRALIA IN 2003 RESULTED IN LOWER MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR VISA AND MASTERCARD ACCEPTANCE. AS A RESULT OF THESE REGULATION-DRIVEN CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, WE REDUCED OUR OWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES IN AUSTRALIA OVER TIME, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE

BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE BILLED BUSINESS AND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING OUR CARDS. WE HAVE SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON OUR CARDS IN AUSTRALIA IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS GREATER THAN

THAT APPLIED TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, WHICH IS KNOWN AS DIFFERENTIAL SURCHARGING. THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA CHANGED THE AUSTRALIAN SURCHARGING STANDARDS BEGINNING MARCH 18, 2013 TO ALLOW US AND OTHER NETWORKS TO LIMIT A

MERCHANTS RIGHT TO SURCHARGE TO THE REASONABLE COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE. THIS COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT DIFFERENTIALLY SURCHARGE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, DODD-FRANK GAVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH RULES REGARDING INTERCHANGE FEES CHARGED BY PAYMENT

CARD ISSUERS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS (WHICH INCLUDE TRANSACTIONS USING A DEBIT CARD OR GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARD) AND TO ENFORCE A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT SUCH FEES BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE COST OF A TRANSACTION

TO THE ISSUER, WITH SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES FOR THE COSTS OF FRAUD PREVENTION, AS WELL AS TO PROHIBIT EXCLUSIVE NETWORK ROUTING RESTRICTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DEBIT TRANSACTIONS. RELOADABLE GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS (BUT NOT THOSE MARKETED OR LABELED AS

GIFT CARDS OR GIFT CERTIFICATES) ARE EXEMPT FROM THE INTERCHANGE FEE LIMITATIONS PROVIDED THEY MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. THE FEDERAL RESERVES RULE PROVIDES THAT THE REGULATIONS ON INTERCHANGE AND ROUTING DO NOT APPLY TO A THREE-PARTY NETWORK

LIKE AMERICAN EXPRESS WHEN IT ACTS AS BOTH THE ISSUER AND THE NETWORK FOR ITS PREPAID CARDS, AND IS THEREFORE NOT A PAYMENT CARD

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NETWORK AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED AND USED FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF THE RULE. AS A RESULT, AMERICAN EXPRESS IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS RULE WITH REGARD TO THE PREPAID CARDS IT ISSUES. A COURT

CASE CHALLENGING THE FEDERAL RESERVES DEBIT INTERCHANGE AND ROUTING RULES ALLEGES THE INTERCHANGE FEES WERE SET TOO HIGH AND THE ROUTING REGULATIONS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE CHOICES REQUIRED BY THE LAW. SEE 

THE DODD-FRANK WALL

STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

 IN RISK FACTORS BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT

RESULTING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVES RULE.

ADDITIONALLY, DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD

NETWORKS FROM RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, PROVIDED THAT OFFERS TO ENCOURAGE DEBIT OR CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS DO

NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR ISSUER. FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSED.

DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED TO ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A RESULT OF DODD-FRANK, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY MERCHANTS TO MOVE

AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS TO OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT WITH LOWER FEES, SUCH AS DEBIT CARDS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

IN JANUARY 2012, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC) PUBLISHED A GREEN PAPER (A DOCUMENT TO BEGIN A PROCESS OF CONSULTATION TOWARD

POTENTIAL REGULATION) COVERING A RANGE OF ISSUES AFFECTING THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE EC COMPLETED THE CONSULTATION PROCESS AND ON JULY 24, 2013, ISSUED ITS RECOMMENDATIONS, WHICH INCLUDED DRAFT LEGISLATION NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL (THE EU PAYMENTS PACKAGE). THE ECS RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDED A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD LIKELY HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ACROSS THE INDUSTRY AND WOULD APPLY EITHER IN WHOLE OR IN PART TO US. THE

PROPOSED CHANGES INCLUDE.



PRICE CAPS  THE EC PROPOSED CAPPING INTERCHANGE FEES AT 20 BASIS POINTS FOR DEBIT AND PREPAID CARDS AND 30 BASIS POINTS FOR CREDIT AND CHARGE

CARDS. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE INTERCHANGE FEES LIKE FOUR-PARTY NETWORKS SUCH AS VISA AND MASTERCARD HAVE, THE CAPS WOULD BE DEEMED TO APPLY TO ELEMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS AGREED BETWEEN US AND EACH GNS PARTNER IN THE EU. THE DISCOUNT

RATES WE AGREE WITH MERCHANTS WOULD NOT BE CAPPED, BUT THE INTERCHANGE CAPS COULD EXERT DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON MERCHANT FEES ACROSS THE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING OUR DISCOUNT RATES. THE EC WOULD EXCLUDE COMMERCIAL CARD TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY FROM THE SCOPE

OF THESE CAPS.



NETWORK RULES ON CARD ACCEPTANCE  THE EC PROPOSED TO PROHIBIT HONOR-ALL-CARDS AND ANTI-STEERING RULES ACROSS ALL CARD NETWORKS. IN ADDITION, THE

DRAFT PROPOSALS SOUGHT HARMONIZATION OF SURCHARGING RULES SO THAT, ACROSS THE EU, TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE INTERCHANGE CAPS MAY NOT BE SURCHARGED, BUT TRANSACTIONS FALLING OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE CAPS COULD BE SURCHARGED UP TO COST.



NETWORK LICENSING  THE EC PROPOSED TO REQUIRE ALL NETWORKS, INCLUDING THREE-PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS THAT OPERATE WITH LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS,

WHICH WOULD INCLUDE OUR GNS BUSINESS, TO ESTABLISH OBJECTIVE, PROPORTIONATE AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY CRITERIA UNDER WHICH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COULD QUALIFY TO BE LICENSED TO OPERATE ON THE NETWORK. IN ADDITION, THE SCOPE OF NETWORK LICENSES WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO COVER THE ENTIRE EU. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE FLEXIBILITY AND DISCRETION THAT WE HAVE HAD TO DATE IN DECIDING WHEN, WHERE AND WITH WHOM TO GRANT A LICENSE IN THE GNS BUSINESS.



SEPARATION OF NETWORK PROCESSING  THE EC PROPOSED TO REQUIRE CARD NETWORKS TO SEPARATE THEIR NETWORK PROCESSING FUNCTIONS (IN WHICH TRANSACTIONS

BETWEEN DIFFERENT ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS ARE PROCESSED FOR AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT). THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT APPLY TO THREE-PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, SUCH AS AMERICAN EXPRESS, BUT MAY BE DEEMED APPLICABLE IN SITUATIONS WHERE A DIFFERENT

GNS ISSUER AND ACQUIRER IS INVOLVED IN A TRANSACTION, WHICH REPRESENT A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TRANSACTIONS ON OUR NETWORK. FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS REQUIREMENT IS NEEDED WHERE, AS WITH GNS, LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT

GIVE RISE TO INTER-BANK TRANSACTIONS OR RELATIONSHIPS.

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PROPOSED EU PAYMENTS PACKAGE IS CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO DEBATE AND AMENDMENT BY THE

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL IN A COMPLEX LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND WILL ALSO INVOLVE THE EC. IT IS TOO EARLY TO ASSESS THE EXACT SCOPE AND IMPACT OF ANY FINAL LEGISLATION.

THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE (PSD) PRESCRIBES COMMON RULES ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT

ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PSD IS TO FACILITATE THE OPERATION OF A SINGLE INTERNAL PAYMENTS MARKET IN THE EU THROUGH HARMONIZATION OF EU MEMBER STATE LAWS GOVERNING PAYMENT SERVICES. ONE

PROVISION OF THE PSD PERMITS MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE, SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, BUT ALSO ALLOWS INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES TO OVERRIDE THIS RULE BY PROHIBITING OR LIMITING SURCHARGING. TO DATE, THE MEMBER STATES ARE SPLIT ON WHETHER THEY

PROHIBIT OR PERMIT SURCHARGING, WITH COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM (WHICH FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS HAS PERMITTED IT FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES), THE NETHERLANDS AND SPAIN PERMITTING IT AND OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS FRANCE, ITALY AND SWEDEN

PROHIBITING IT. ALL MEMBER STATES PERMIT MERCHANTS TO OFFER DISCOUNTS FOR PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT. IN 2012, THE EC COMMENCED A REVIEW OF THE PSD, AND ITS RECOMMENDATIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSED EU PAYMENTS PACKAGE DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE PSD COMPLEMENTS ANOTHER EUROPEAN INITIATIVE, THE SINGLE EURO PAYMENTS AREA (SEPA), WHICH IS AN INDUSTRY-LED

INITIATIVE WITH SUPPORT FROM EU INSTITUTIONS. AMONG OTHER CHANGES, SEPA INVOLVES THE ADOPTION OF NEW, PAN-EUROPEAN TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR CARDS AND CARD TRANSACTIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH THE PSD, SEPA AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS HAS INVOLVED SIGNIFICANT

COSTS TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN. IN ADDITION, THE CONSUMER RIGHTS DIRECTIVE (CRD) PROHIBITS MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING CARD PURCHASES MORE THAN THE MERCHANTS COST OF ACCEPTANCE IN THOSE MEMBER STATES THAT PERMIT SURCHARGING

PURSUANT TO THE PSD. THE CRD PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE TO MERCHANTS ON HOW TO ASSESS THE COST OF ACCEPTANCE OR TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RELATIVE VALUE OF DIFFERENT PAYMENT METHODS. A COST-BASED LIMIT ON SURCHARGING COULD RESULT IN MERCHANTS IMPOSING HIGHER

SURCHARGES ON AMERICAN EXPRESS TRANSACTIONS IF, IN THE ABSENCE OF CLEAR GUIDANCE, MERCHANTS TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE COST OF AMERICAN EXPRESS ACCEPTANCE IS HIGHER THAN OTHER PAYMENT CARDS. THESE ELEMENTS OF THE CRD MAY BE SUPERSEDED BY PROPOSALS

NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE EU PAYMENTS PACKAGE DISCUSSED ABOVE.

REGULATORS IN AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, CANADA, HUNGARY,

ITALY, MEXICO, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND, SWITZERLAND, THE UNITED KINGDOM, VENEZUELA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS INTO, OR INITIATED PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO, INTERCHANGE FEES THAT ARE ONGOING, CONCLUDED OR ON

APPEAL. FOR EXAMPLE, IN DECEMBER 2007 THE EC RULED THAT MASTERCARDS MULTILATERAL INTERCHANGE FEES (MIF) FOR CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTIONS VIOLATE EC TREATY RULES ON RESTRICTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES, WHICH WAS UPHELD BY THE

EUROPEAN GENERAL COURT IN 2012. IN 2008, THE EC OPENED FORMAL ANTITRUST PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VISA EUROPE LIMITED IN RELATION TO VISAS MIFS FOR CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS WITHIN EUROPE. IN 2010, THE EC ACCEPTED VISA EUROPES

PLEDGE TO CUT ITS CROSS-BORDER DEBIT CARD MIF TO 20 BASIS POINTS FOR FOUR YEARS AND IN MAY 2013 THE EC PUBLISHED FOR COMMENT VISA EUROPES PROPOSED COMMITMENTS TO CUT ITS CROSS-BORDER CREDIT CARD MIF TO 30 BASIS POINTS AND CHANGE ITS RULES ON

HOW CROSS-BORDER INTERCHANGE IS APPLIED.

IN SOME COUNTRIES IN ASIA, GOVERNMENTS HAVE ESTABLISHED REGULATORY REGIMES THAT

REQUIRE INTERNATIONAL CARD NETWORKS TO BE LOCALLY LICENSED AND/OR TO LOCALIZE ASPECTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, CARD NETWORK OPERATORS IN INDIA MUST OBTAIN AUTHORIZATION FROM THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA, WHICH HAS BROAD POWER UNDER THE PAYMENT

AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS ACT 2007 TO REGULATE THE MEMBERSHIP AND OPERATIONS OF CARD NETWORKS. IN INDONESIA, BANK REGULATIONS REQUIRE PARTICIPANTS IN A CARD PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT BUSINESS TO OBTAIN A LICENSE AND ESTABLISH A LOCAL LEGAL ENTITY.

GOVERNMENTS IN SOME COUNTRIES ALSO PROVIDE RESOURCES OR PROTECTION TO SELECT DOMESTIC PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS. THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF THESE AND OTHER SIMILAR LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN SUCH COUNTRIES AND EXTEND OUR GLOBAL NETWORK.

CHARGE CARDS

OUR CHARGE

CARDS, WHICH GENERALLY CARRY NO PRESET SPENDING LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES. CHARGES ARE APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A CARD MEMBERS

CURRENT SPENDING PATTERNS, PAYMENT HISTORY, CREDIT RECORD AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. CARD MEMBERS GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST DUE ARE SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY ASSESSMENT AND,

IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE CANCELLED. THE NO-PRESET SPENDING LIMIT AND PAY-IN-FULL NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS ATTRACT HIGH-SPENDING CARD MEMBERS.

THE CHARGE CARDS ALSO OFFER SEVERAL WAYS FOR ELIGIBLE U.S. CARD MEMBERS TO PAY OFF CERTAIN OF THEIR PURCHASES OVER

TIME. THE SIGN & TRAVEL

®

FEATURE PERMITS ELIGIBLE U.S. CARD MEMBERS TO EXTEND PAYMENT FOR AIRLINE

TICKETS, CRUISE SHIP TICKETS AND OTHER TRAVEL ITEMS PURCHASED WITH OUR CHARGE CARDS. THE EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION PROVIDES ELIGIBLE U.S. CARD MEMBERS THE ABILITY TO EXTEND PAYMENT FOR ELIGIBLE CHARGES ABOVE A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT.

REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS

WE OFFER A VARIETY OF REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS THAT HAVE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT PAYMENT TERMS, INTEREST RATE AND FEE STRUCTURES, REWARDS PROGRAMS, AND CARD MEMBER BENEFITS. REVOLVING CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS,

SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

, BLUE CASH EVERYDAY

®

CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, BLUE SKY FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

AND BLUE FOR BUSINESS

®

CARD,

PROVIDE CARD MEMBERS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO PAY THEIR BILL IN FULL EACH MONTH OR CARRY A MONTHLY BALANCE ON THEIR CARDS TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES. ALONG WITH CHARGE CARDS AND CO-BRAND CARDS, THESE REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS PROMOTE

INCREASED RELEVANCE FOR OUR EXPANDING MERCHANT NETWORK.

CO-BRAND CARDS

WE ISSUE CARDS UNDER CO-BRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES. ATTAINING ATTRACTIVE CO-BRAND CARD

PARTNERSHIPS IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AMONG CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS AS THESE PARTNERSHIPS CAN GENERATE HIGH-SPENDING LOYAL CUSTOMERS. THE DURATION OF OUR CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS. CARD MEMBERS EARN REWARDS

PROVIDED BY THE PARTNERS RESPECTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR SPENDING ON THE CO-BRAND CARDS, SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY POINTS AND CASH BACK. WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR CO-BRAND PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED

PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF CARD MEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. WE EXPENSE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MONTH

EARNED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. IN SOME CASES, THE PARTNER IS SOLELY LIABLE FOR PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARD MEMBER UNDER THE CO-BRAND PARTNERS OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM. AS THE ISSUER OF THE CO-BRAND CARD,

WE RETAIN ALL THE CREDIT RISK WITH THE CARD MEMBER AND BEAR THE RECEIVABLES FUNDING AND OPERATING EXPENSES FOR SUCH CARDS. THE CO-BRAND PARTNER RETAINS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE MILES, POINTS OR OTHER CURRENCY EARNED BY THE CARD MEMBER UNDER THE

PARTNERS LOYALTY PROGRAM.

CARD PRICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

ON CERTAIN CARDS WE CHARGE AN ANNUAL FEE THAT VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD AND THE NUMBER OF CARDS FOR EACH ACCOUNT. WE ALSO OFFER

MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS ON WHICH WE ASSESS FINANCE CHARGES FOR REVOLVING BALANCES. DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, WE MAY ALSO CHARGE CARD MEMBERS AN ANNUAL PROGRAM FEE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAMS AND FEES FOR ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE

(E.G., LATE FEES) OR FOR CERTAIN OPTIONAL SERVICES. WE APPLY STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR CREDITWORTHINESS TO EACH CARD MEMBER THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS BOTH AT THE TIME OF INITIAL SOLICITATION OR APPLICATION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING THE CARD

RELATIONSHIP. WE USE SOPHISTICATED CREDIT MODELS AND TECHNIQUES IN OUR RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF OUR

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

®

PROGRAM

THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS ALLOWS CARD MEMBERS TO EARN ONE POINT FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY DOLLAR CHARGED ON ELIGIBLE,

ENROLLED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND THEN REDEEM POINTS FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF REWARDS, INCLUDING TRAVEL, RETAIL MERCHANDISE, DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND DONATIONS TO BENEFIT CHARITIES. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CARDS BY THEIR

TERMS ALLOW CARD MEMBERS TO EARN BONUS POINTS FOR PURCHASES AT MERCHANTS IN PARTICULAR INDUSTRY CATEGORIES. POINTS GENERALLY HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF POINTS ONE CAN EARN. A LARGE MAJORITY OF SPENDING BY ELIGIBLE

CARD MEMBERS EARNS POINTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS ARE ALIGNED WITH SPECIFIC CARD PRODUCTS TO BETTER MEET CARD MEMBER LIFESTYLE AND REWARDS PROGRAM USAGE NEEDS. AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD MEMBERS PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THREE

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS BASED ON THEIR CREDIT OR CHARGE CARD.

WE BELIEVE OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINT BANK IS A

SUBSTANTIAL ASSET AND A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE WAYS TO USE POINTS. IN 2013 WE INTRODUCED A NEW USE POINTS FOR CHARGES FEATURE IN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS MOBILE APP THAT GIVES

ELIGIBLE CARD MEMBERS THE OPTION TO USE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TO PAY FOR ANY ELIGIBLE TRANSACTION ABOVE $1 ONCE THE CHARGE APPEARS ON THE CARD MEMBERS STATEMENT. WE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH VERIFONE SYSTEMS, INC. THAT ENABLES

ELIGIBLE CARD MEMBERS TO USE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS FOR THEIR FARES IN CERTAIN NEW YORK CITY TAXI CABS.

WHEN A CARD MEMBER

ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM USES THE CARD, WE ESTABLISH RESERVES TO COVER THE COST OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REWARD REDEMPTIONS FOR POINTS EARNED TO DATE. WHEN A MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ENROLLEE REDEEMS A REWARD USING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

POINTS, WE MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM PARTNER PROVIDING THE REWARD PURSUANT TO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE IS DRIVEN BY CARD MEMBER CHARGE VOLUME, CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH REDEMPTION PARTNERS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE APPEARING ON PAGE 47 OF OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER

OF CARD MEMBER SPENDING AND LOYALTY. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CARD MEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS PROGRAMS YIELD HIGHER SPEND, STRONGER CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND GREATER PROFIT FOR US. BY OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES,

WE HAVE GIVEN OUR CARD MEMBERS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THEIR REWARDS POINTS ON A COST EFFECTIVE BASIS. WE CONTINUE TO SEEK TO OPTIMIZE THE OVERALL ECONOMICS OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE TO CARD MEMBERS AND TO

MERCHANTS. OUR PROGRAM IS ALSO VALUABLE TO MERCHANTS THAT BECOME REDEMPTION PARTNERS AS WE BRING THEM HIGH-SPENDING CARD MEMBERS AND NEW MARKETING CHANNELS TO REACH THESE CARD MEMBERS.

CARD MEMBER SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, OUR CARD

MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CARDS THEY HAVE. EXAMPLES OF THESE SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE FEE-BASED, INCLUDE.

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS  COMPETITION

OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. AS A CARD ISSUER,

WE COMPETE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS (SUCH AS BANK OF AMERICA, CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL, CITIBANK, DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND JPMORGAN CHASE). WE ALSO ENCOUNTER

COMPETITION FROM BUSINESSES THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN PRIVATE LABEL CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ONLY AT LIMITED LOCATIONS. IN RECENT YEARS,

WE HAVE FACED INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR, AS COMPETITORS HAVE TARGETED OPENS CUSTOMER BASE AND OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO SMALL BUSINESSES.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD

PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS. COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT CARDHOLDERS, INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR LINES OF CREDIT, AIRLINE FREQUENT

FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS, CASH REBATES AND OTHER REWARD OR REBATE PROGRAMS, SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, TEASER PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES AND REWARDS POINTS FOR BOTH CREDIT CARD ACQUISITION AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND

CO-BRANDED ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS.

MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND

DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ALSO ISSUE DEBIT CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL-PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE

VISA OR MASTERCARD LOGO. DEBIT CARDS WERE HISTORICALLY MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH AND CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN FOR SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS. HOWEVER, DEBIT CARDS ARE INCREASINGLY PERCEIVED AS AN

ALTERNATIVE TO CREDIT OR CHARGE CARDS AND USED IN THAT MANNER. ADDITIONALLY, OVERDRAFT ACCOUNTS CAN BE USED BY OUR COMPETITORS TO EXTEND CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS WHEN TRANSACTION VALUES EXCEED MONIES AVAILABLE IN A LINKED DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNT.

AS THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE ARE ALSO FACING INCREASING COMPETITION FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS, SUCH AS

ONLINE NETWORKS, TELECOM PROVIDERS AND SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE PROVIDERS, THAT LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CUSTOMERS EXISTING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS AND BANK RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT OR OTHER FEE-BASED SOLUTIONS. IN ADDITION,

THE EVOLUTION OF PAYMENT PRODUCTS IN EMERGING MARKETS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPED MARKETS. INSTEAD OF MIGRATING FROM CASH TO CHECKS TO PLASTIC, TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER BEHAVIORS IN THESE MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE SKIPPING OF ONE

OR MORE STEPS TO ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS SUCH AS MOBILE PAYMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE EVOLVING COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, SEE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  COMPETITION UNDER

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES ABOVE AND ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP  COMPETITION UNDER CORPORATE & OTHER BELOW.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS INCLUDE.



THE FEATURES AND QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CARE, REWARDS PROGRAMS, PARTNERSHIPS, BENEFITS AND DIGITAL RESOURCES,

PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS, AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING SUCH FEATURES AND SERVICES



THE NUMBER, SPENDING CHARACTERISTICS AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF CUSTOMERS



THE QUANTITY, DIVERSITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS



THE PRICING, PAYMENT AND OTHER CARD ACCOUNT TERMS AND CONDITIONS



THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF OTHER PAYMENT CARDS AND OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT, SUCH AS DEBIT CARDS AND ELECTRONIC WALLETS, AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS



REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION



THE LEVEL AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ADVERTISING INVESTMENTS AND MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS



THE NATURE AND QUALITY OF EXPENSE MANAGEMENT DATA CAPTURE AND REPORTING CAPABILITY, PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

FINANCING OF RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE SALE OF MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB FINANCE THEIR REVOLVING CREDIT RECEIVABLES AND CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES, IN PART, THROUGH THE SALE OF

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND BY ACCEPTING CONSUMER DEPOSITS IN THE UNITED STATES. TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ALSO FUND RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS. THE COST OF FUNDING CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR EXPENSE OF CARD

OPERATIONS.

THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF OUR SECURITIZATION AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 37-41 UNDER THE CAPTION

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS. AEBFSB ALSO

ACCEPTS DEPOSITS DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS

PERSONAL SAVINGS, A SET OF DEPOSIT PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING HIGH-YIELD SAVINGS AND CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $40.8 BILLION IN TOTAL U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS. OUR DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES COMPETE WITH THOSE OF OTHER DEPOSIT-TAKING ORGANIZATIONS

THAT SOURCE DEPOSITS THROUGH TELEPHONE, INTERNET AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DELIVERY CHANNELS, BROKERAGE NETWORKS AND/OR BRANCH LOCATIONS. WE COMPETE PRIMARILY IN THE DEPOSIT SECTOR ON THE BASIS OF RATES AND OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS IS DEPENDENT ON THE CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR U.S.

BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT (FDIA) GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE

PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS (1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. A BANK THAT IS LESS THAN

WELL CAPITALIZED GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN A

HIGH-RATE AREA. AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION BY THE FDIC. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT SOLICIT DEPOSITS BY OFFERING INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN THE MARKET AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS

WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL

DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT THE INSTITUTION IS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING

PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED, OR REQUIRE AN UNDERCAPITALIZED

INSTITUTION TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS, ALL OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE INSTITUTIONS ABILITY TO ACCEPT BROKERED DEPOSITS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR OUR U.S. BANKING

SUBSIDIARIES, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, AND OUR OTHER BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATION THEREOF COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REFINE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS,

REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRUDENTLY AND CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS.

THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND ROBUST, AND SUPERVISORY EFFORTS TO APPLY RELEVANT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES HAVE BECOME MORE INTENSE. INTERNAL AND

REGULATORY REVIEWS HAVE RESULTED IN, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, CHANGES TO PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES. SUCH REVIEWS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, SUPERVISION AND

EXAMINATION AND ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION TO CARD MEMBERS, AND MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REGULATORY ACTIONS, INCLUDING CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES. IN OCTOBER 2012, THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB REACHED SETTLEMENTS WITH SEVERAL BANK REGULATORS

RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR U.S. CONSUMER CARD PRACTICES. IN DECEMBER 2013, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB REACHED SETTLEMENTS WITH THE FDIC, OCC AND CFPB TO RESOLVE REGULATORY REVIEWS OF MARKETING AND BILLING PRACTICES RELATED TO SEVERAL

CREDIT CARD ADD-ON PRODUCTS. AEBFSBS SETTLEMENT WITH THE OCC REPLACED AND TERMINATED A PUBLIC, WRITTEN SUPERVISORY AGREEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION (OTS), WHICH WAS THEN ITS PRIMARY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR AND

CONTINUED TO REMAIN IN EFFECT FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER OF SUPERVISION OF AEBFSB FROM THE OTS TO THE OCC. AEBFSBS SETTLEMENT WITH THE OCC ALSO REPLACED AND TERMINATED THE PUBLIC CONSENT ORDER WITH THE OCC ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION WITH THE

OCTOBER 2012 SETTLEMENTS. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE SETTLEMENTS REACHED IN DECEMBER 2013, SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL, AN INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

ISSUED GUIDANCE TO THE INDUSTRY ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES (THE GUIDANCE). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE AREAS: (1) CREDIT LINE MANAGEMENT; (2) OVER-LIMIT PRACTICES; (3) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND

NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION PRACTICES; (4) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES; AND (5) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB EVALUATE AND DISCUSS THE GUIDANCE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS ON

AN ONGOING BASIS AS PART OF THEIR REGULATORY EXAMINATION PROCESSES, AND, AS A RESULT, MAY REFINE THEIR PRACTICES FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON REGULATORY INPUT. THE GUIDANCE HAS NOT HAD, NOR DO WE EXPECT IT TO HAVE, ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR

IN THIS REPORT, REGULATORS CONTINUED TO PROPOSE AND ENACT A VARIETY OF NEW REGULATORY CHANGES TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY DURING THE COURSE OF 2013.

IN EUROPE, THE EU CONTINUED IN ITS EFFORTS TO WORK TOWARDS GREATER HARMONIZATION ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS, IN PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO PAYMENTS, AML, CONSUMER RIGHTS, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION

SECURITY. THESE PAN-EUROPEAN INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN SUPPLEMENTED BY A BROAD RANGE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION AND TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVES AT AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATE LEVEL.

IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE EUROPE, WE HAVE SEEN REGULATORS INITIATE NEW REGULATIONS IN RELATION TO A NUMBER OF KEY THEMES, PARTICULARLY FAIRNESS (SUCH AS CANADA), RESPONSIBLE LENDING (SUCH AS CANADA, MEXICO,

NEW ZEALAND AND SINGAPORE), PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION (SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, CANADA, MEXICO AND SINGAPORE) AND FINANCIAL CRIME.

REGULATORS IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE SHIFTING THEIR FOCUS FROM JUST ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RULES AND REGULATIONS TOWARDS

PAYING GREATER ATTENTION TO THE PRODUCT DESIGN AND OPERATION WITH A FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS AND OUTCOMES. REGULATORS EXPECTATIONS OF FIRMS IN RELATION TO THEIR COMPLIANCE, RISK AND CONTROL FRAMEWORKS

AS ANNOUNCED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, WE PLAN TO CREATE A NEW

JOINT VENTURE FOR OUR GBT BUSINESS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT GBTS OPERATIONS, BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS AND OTHER ASSETS WOULD BE HELD AND OPERATED BY THE JOINT VENTURE. AS PRESENTLY CONTEMPLATED, AT THE CLOSING OF THE JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION WE

WOULD MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATE 50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP STAKE IN THE JOINT VENTURE, WHILE AN INVESTOR GROUP WOULD OWN THE REMAINING INTEREST. THE JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CREATE GREATER INVESTMENT CAPACITY FOR GBT TO FURTHER ENHANCE ITS

SUITE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS AND GROW INTERNATIONALLY. THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION REMAINS SUBJECT TO THE EXECUTION OF DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND RECEIPT OF REGULATORY AND OTHER APPROVALS.

IN 2013, WE LAUNCHED SEVERAL NEW TECHNOLOGY-RELATED PROGRAMS AND CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT OUR CORPORATE CLIENTS,

INCLUDING A NEW MOBILE VERSION OF AX CONNECT

, OUR TRAVELER TRACKING AND ALERT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES

TRAVELERS WITH ALERTS AND TRAVEL INFORMATION CUSTOMIZED TO THEIR TRAVEL ITINERARY DIRECTLY TO THEIR MOBILE DEVICES.

GLOBAL BUSINESS

TRAVEL  COMPETITION

GBT CONTINUES TO ADJUST TO THE SHIFT OF ITS CLIENTS PREFERENCES, AND THE RESULTING

SHIFT OF SOME VOLUME, FROM HIGH-TOUCH PERSONAL SERVICE TO ONLINE CHANNELS AND AUTOMATED SERVICING TOOLS. GBT ALSO CONTINUES TO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FROM NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT

COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM AIRLINES DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER BUSINESS, OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS, ACCREDITED IN-HOUSE CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS AND NEW ENTRANTS TO THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED ON

PRICE, SERVICE, VALUE CREATION, CONVENIENCE, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY TO THE CUSTOMER.

FOR MANY YEARS, CONSUMER AND

BUSINESS TRAVEL AGENCIES (INCLUDING TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES) HAVE FACED PRESSURE ON REVENUES FROM AIRLINES, AS MOST AIRLINES HAVE STOPPED PAYING BASE COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OTHER FORMS

OF TRAVEL AGENT COMPENSATION. AIRLINES HAVE ALSO MADE EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS BOOKED DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR WEBSITES. THESE TRENDS HAVE REDUCED THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT

RECEIVE DISTRIBUTION REVENUE FROM TRANSACTIONS BOOKED DIRECTLY WITH THE AIRLINES. IN RECENT YEARS, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS INCLUDING EXPANDED GRANTS OF ANTITRUST

IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES. THIS ANTITRUST IMMUNITY ENABLES OTHERWISE INDEPENDENT AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER REGIONS. THESE TYPES OF

STRUCTURAL CHANGES MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THESE ISSUES, SEE RISK FACTORS BELOW.

OVERALL, INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, THE ONGOING TRENDS OF INCREASED BOOKINGS DIRECTLY WITH AIRLINES, THE RISE OF LOW-COST CARRIERS, ONGOING REDUCTIONS IN OR ELIMINATION OF

AIRLINE COMMISSIONS AND FEES, AND THE SHIFT OF CUSTOMER PREFERENCES TO ONLINE CHANNELS AND AUTOMATED SERVICING TOOLS CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY FOR TRAVEL AGENCIES.

RELEVANT TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE IN THIS SECTION. OUR PUBLISHING BUSINESS, WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN INCLUDED IN CORPORATE & OTHER, WAS SOLD TO TIME INC. ON OCTOBER 1, 2013.

AS DISCUSSED IN CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY ON PAGE 35 OF OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, OUR

CORPORATE LIQUIDITY OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO CASH, READILY-MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CONTINGENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, SUCH THAT WE CAN CONTINUOUSLY MEET EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCING OBLIGATIONS AND BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST A

TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD, EVEN IN THE EVENT WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE NEW FUNDS UNDER REGULAR FUNDING PROGRAMS DURING A SUBSTANTIAL WEAKENING IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. A LARGE PORTION OF THE INTEREST EXPENSE IN CORPORATE & OTHER INCLUDES THE INTEREST

EXPENSE RELATED TO MAINTAINING THIS LIQUIDITY POOL SINCE ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES BENEFIT FROM THE LIQUIDITY, AS WELL AS INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO OTHER CORPORATE INDEBTEDNESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SECTOR IS PARTICULARLY DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH A

VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COMPETITORS THAT OFFER OR ARE DEVELOPING PAYMENT SYSTEMS IN E-COMMERCE AND ACROSS MOBILE DEVICES, AND WITH FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS IN RESPONSE TO EVOLVING CONSUMER HABITS AND MERCHANT NEEDS. THESE COMPETITORS INCLUDE

TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS, BANKING INSTITUTIONS, ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS, AND INCREASINGLY ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROVIDERS, SUCH AS PAYPAL, GOOGLE WALLET AND SQUARE, AS WELL AS OTHER

NON-TRADITIONAL INDUSTRY PLAYERS, SUCH AS MOBILE OPERATORS, HANDSET MANUFACTURERS, TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, RETAILERS AND OTHER START-UPS AND NEW ENTRANTS TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. PARTNERSHIPS ARE ALSO BEING FORMED AMONG VARIOUS COMPETITORS, SUCH AS

PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN PAYPAL AND DISCOVER OR BETWEEN SQUARE AND STARBUCKS, AND MERCHANT COALITIONS LIKE THE MERCHANT CUSTOMER EXCHANGE (MCX). AMONG OTHER SERVICES, THESE COMPETITORS PROVIDE OR ARE SEEKING TO DEVELOP DIGITAL PAYMENT AND/OR STORED

VALUE CAPABILITIES THAT CAN BE USED TO BUY AND SELL GOODS ONLINE, THAT CAN MAKE MORE EFFICIENT THE MOVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF MONEY, ALTERNATIVE POINT-OF-SALE SYSTEMS THAT ENABLE DIGITAL PAYMENTS AT THE PHYSICAL POINT OF SALE, AND SERVICES THAT

SUPPORT PAYMENTS TO AND FROM DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS OR PROPRIETARY ACCOUNTS FOR DIGITAL, MOBILE COMMERCE AND OTHER APPLICATIONS. A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS RELY PRINCIPALLY ON THE INTERNET, MOBILE DEVICES, AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORKS TO SUPPORT THEIR

SERVICES, AND MAY ENJOY LOWER COSTS THAN WE DO. OTHER COMPETITORS WORKING TO DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES MAY HAVE AND MAY DEPLOY SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER CASH RESERVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE OR MAY OFFER A WIDER

RANGE OF SERVICES AND CAPABILITIES THAN WE OFFER. OTHER COMPETITORS MAY ALSO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS AND LICENSES THAT ENABLE EASIER MARKET ENTRY, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CONSUMER AND MERCHANT ADOPTION IS A KEY COMPETITIVE

FACTOR AND OUR COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP PLATFORMS OR TECHNOLOGIES THAT BECOME MORE WIDELY ADOPTED THAN OURS. MICRO-PAYMENTS ON SOCIAL NETWORKS AND EMERGING DIGITAL CURRENCY SYSTEMS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL TODAY BUT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GROW RAPIDLY,

REPRESENTING THE POSSIBILITY FOR COMPETITION FROM THESE NEW PAYMENT FORMS AND PROTOCOLS. COMPETITION WILL REMAIN FIERCE AS PAYMENT SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE.

ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP  REGULATION

AS AN ISSUER OF PREPAID CARDS

AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES, WE ARE REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE MONEY TRANSMITTER OR SALE OF CHECK LAWS IN EFFECT IN MOST STATES. THESE LAWS REQUIRE ISSUERS TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD

OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN HIGHLY RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. WE HOLD THE FUNDS RECEIVED FOR PREPAID CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW, PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY RATED DEBT SECURITIES

CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AND BANK DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. MANY STATES EXAMINE LICENSEES ANNUALLY.

IN ADDITION, THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELERS CHECK ISSUERS AND THE PROVIDERS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES AS MONEY

SERVICE BUSINESSES AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE AML RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, THE BANK SECRECY ACT REQUIRES THAT WE MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAM FOR PREPAID PRODUCTS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE VARYING

LICENSING AND AML REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.

PREPAID CARD AND TRAVELERS

CHECK ISSUERS ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAWS OF MANY STATES TO COMPLY WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS, UNDER WHICH SUCH ISSUERS MUST PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY TRAVELERS CHECK OR PREPAID CARD THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER

A PERIOD OF TIME DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PRODUCT. IN RECENT YEARS, A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION ESTABLISHING SHORTER PERIODS FOR TRAVELERS CHECKS AND/OR PREPAID CARDS, OFTEN WITH RETROACTIVE APPLICATION. WE HAVE CHALLENGED, AND INTEND

TO CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE, WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE SIGNIFICANT DEFECTS IN THESE LAWS, WHICH CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS BUSINESS IN THE STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE ENACTED.

MORE GENERALLY, WE CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY CONCERNING ANY OF OUR PREPAID OFFERINGS. IN CERTAIN STATES WHERE

REGULATION CONTINUES TO RESTRICT FEES AND HAS MADE IT UNPROFITABLE FOR US TO OFFER PREPAID CARDS, WE HAVE EITHER LIMITED OR WITHDRAWN FROM SELLING IN THESE STATES.

THE GLOBAL SERVICES GROUP

THE GLOBAL SERVICES GROUP (GLOBAL SERVICES) WAS CREATED TO HEIGHTEN THE COMPANYS FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TO ENSURE

ALL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED AS EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. WE HAVE ORGANIZED SUPPORT FUNCTIONS BY PROCESS RATHER THAN BUSINESS UNIT, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES SERVES TO STREAMLINE COSTS, REDUCE DUPLICATION OF WORK, BETTER

INTEGRATE SKILLS AND EXPERTISE, AND IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

GLOBAL SERVICES COMPRISED PRINCIPALLY THE FOLLOWING DIVISIONS.

WORLD SERVICE

OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONSOLIDATED UNDER WORLD SERVICE. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE UNITS HAVE WORKED OVER A

NUMBER OF YEARS TO ENSURE OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IMPROVING OPERATING MARGINS. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES RELEASED ITS ANNUAL NATIONWIDE CREDIT CARD SATISFACTION STUDY AND RANKED AMERICAN

EXPRESS HIGHEST IN OVERALL SATISFACTION AMONG 10 OF THE LARGEST CARD ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR.

GLOBAL

BUSINESS SERVICES

THE GLOBAL BUSINESS SERVICES DIVISION IS A SHARED SERVICES ORGANIZATION THAT INCLUDES PROCUREMENT, REAL

ESTATE, FINANCIAL OPERATIONS AND PROCESSING, AND BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION. THESE INTERNAL PROCESS-DRIVEN ACTIVITIES ARE CONSOLIDATED TO SIMPLIFY AND STANDARDIZE PROCESSES FOR INCREASED QUALITY, EFFICIENCY AND COST SAVINGS.

GLOBAL CREDIT ADMINISTRATION

GLOBAL CREDIT ADMINISTRATION (GCA) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE END-TO-END MANAGEMENT OF OUR CREDIT, COLLECTIONS AND FRAUD OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. GCA AIMS TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN

HELPING CARD MEMBERS IN NEED THROUGH A RANGE OF REPAYMENT OPTIONS, AND TAKING ACTIONS TO RECOVER BALANCES AND LIMIT EXPOSURE FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS.

TECHNOLOGIES

WE CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN OUR SYSTEMS AND

INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW FASTER INTRODUCTION AND GREATER DIFFERENTIATION OF PRODUCTS, WHILE MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER DATA. WE ALSO USE TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICE CAPABILITIES TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER A HIGH QUALITY

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAINTAIN A SERVICE DELIVERY PLATFORM THAT OUR EMPLOYEES USE IN THE CARD BUSINESS TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER SERVICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE, UPDATING OF CARD MEMBER

INFORMATION, THE ADDITION OF NEW CARDS TO AN ACCOUNT AND RESOLVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ISSUES.

WE CONTINUE TO DEVOTE

RESOURCES TO OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS TO ENSURE A HIGH LEVEL OF DATA INTEGRITY, INFORMATION SECURITY, DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY. OUR INTERNAL IT ORGANIZATION RETAINS KEY TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCIES, SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND

INFORMATION SECURITY, WHILE OUTSOURCING MOST OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT AND APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. THIS ENABLES US TO BENEFIT FROM THIRD-PARTY EXPERTISE AND LOWER INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY COSTS PER TRANSACTION. WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR INTERNAL POLICIES AND APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS, AS DESCRIBED UNDER SUPERVISION AND

REGULATION  PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION BELOW.

WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE ONLINE CHANNELS TO LOWER COSTS, IMPROVE

SERVICE QUALITY AND ENHANCE OUR BUSINESS MODEL. AS OF THE END OF 2013, CUSTOMERS HAD ENROLLED APPROXIMATELY 31 MILLION ACCOUNTS GLOBALLY IN OUR ONLINE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY AT AMERICANEXPRESS.COM. THIS SERVICE ENABLES CARD MEMBERS TO

REVIEW ALL OF THEIR CARD TRANSACTIONS ONLINE (WHETHER VIA DESKTOP, TABLET OR MOBILE DEVICE), PAY THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS BILLS ELECTRONICALLY, VIEW AND SERVICE THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ACCOUNTS AND CONDUCT VARIOUS OTHER

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

OVERVIEW

FEDERAL

AND STATE BANKING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES EXTENSIVELY REGULATE THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, INCLUDING PRESCRIBING STANDARDS RELATING TO CAPITAL, EARNINGS, LIQUIDITY, STRESS TESTS, RESOLUTION PLANNING, DIVIDENDS, THE REPURCHASE

OR REDEMPTION OF SHARES, LOANS OR EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO AFFILIATES AND INSIDERS, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, INTERNAL CONTROLS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, RISK MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL AUDIT SYSTEMS, COMPENSATION, LOAN DOCUMENTATION, CREDIT UNDERWRITING, ASSET

GROWTH AND IMPAIRED ASSETS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR DEPOSITORS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS, AS WELL AS TO MINIMIZE SYSTEMIC RISK, AND NOT FOR THE

PROTECTION OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS OR OTHER CREDITORS. FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008, NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE PROMULGATED, AND SUPERVISORY EFFORTS TO APPLY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES HAVE BECOME MORE INTENSE THROUGH INCREASED

EXAMINATION SCRUTINY, HEIGHTENED REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS REGARDING COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS

COMPANY AND TRS ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, AND HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY

THE FEDERAL RESERVE. UNDER THE SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISES THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ALL ITS NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES, AS AN UMBRELLA REGULATOR OF THE CONSOLIDATED

ORGANIZATION AND GENERALLY DEFERS TO THE PRIMARY U.S. REGULATORS OF THE COMPANYS U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS. BANKING REGULATORS HAVE BROAD EXAMINATION

AND ENFORCEMENT POWER OVER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THE POWER TO IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL FINES, LIMIT DIVIDENDS AND OTHER CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, RESTRICT OPERATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS AND REQUIRE DIVESTITURES. BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES AND BANKS, AS WELL AS SUBSIDIARIES OF BOTH, ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ENGAGING IN PRACTICES THAT THE RELEVANT REGULATORY AUTHORITY DEEMS UNSAFE OR UNSOUND. THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION, EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT BY THE CFPB WITH RESPECT TO MARKETING AND SALE OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER LAWS, THE CFPA AND THE TILA. SEE

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS AND DEPOSIT PROGRAMS  REGULATION WITHIN U.S. CARD SERVICES ABOVE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATION AND REVIEW OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS REGULATION BY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND BY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR REGULATORY BODIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES. CERTAIN OF OUR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF

2002 (SARBANES-OXLEY) AND RELATED REGULATIONS AND RULES OF THE SEC AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TO THE EXTENT THAT DIFFERENT REGULATORY SYSTEMS IMPOSE OVERLAPPING OR INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS ON THE

CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE FACE COMPLEXITY AND ADDITIONAL COSTS IN OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS. NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT), AS WELL AS THE ENFORCEMENT OF BOTH

EXISTING AND NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION, SEE RISK FACTORSLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS BELOW FOR A

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES MAY HAVE ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES

THE BHC ACT LIMITS THE NON-BANKING ACTIVITIES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. THE ACTIVITIES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE NOT ELECTED TO

BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES ARE RESTRICTED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS DETERMINED ARE SO CLOSELY RELATED TO BANKING AS TO BE A PROPER INCIDENT THERETO. AN ELIGIBLE BANK HOLDING COMPANY MAY

ELECT TO BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES. A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY MAY ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY RULE OR ORDER TO BE FINANCIAL IN NATURE,

INCIDENTAL TO SUCH FINANCIAL ACTIVITY, OR (WITH PRIOR FEDERAL RESERVE APPROVAL) COMPLEMENTARY TO A FINANCIAL ACTIVITY AND THAT DOES NOT POSE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THE SAFETY OR SOUNDNESS OF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR TO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

GENERALLY. AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN VARIOUS ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE ONLY FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY INCLUDING, IN PARTICULAR, PROVIDING TRAVEL AGENCY

SERVICES, ACTING AS A FINDER AND ENGAGING IN CERTAIN INSURANCE UNDERWRITING AND AGENCY SERVICES.

FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY

TO BECOME AND REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST BE WELL CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED, AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S.

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST A SATISFACTORY RATING ON ITS MOST RECENT ASSESSMENT UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT OF 1977 (THE CRA). IF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY FAILS TO MEET APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY STATUS (WHICH, IN MOST CASES, IS CONFIDENTIAL SUPERVISORY INFORMATION), IT IS LIKELY TO BE BARRED FROM ENGAGING IN NEW TYPES OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES OR MAKING CERTAIN TYPES OF ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS IN RELIANCE ON ITS STATUS AS

A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, AND ULTIMATELY COULD BE REQUIRED TO EITHER DISCONTINUE THE BROADER RANGE OF ACTIVITIES PERMITTED TO FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES OR DIVEST ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS BANKS AND THEIR AFFILIATES FROM ENGAGING IN PROPRIETARY TRADING AND INVESTING IN AND SPONSORING HEDGE FUNDS AND

PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS. THE STATUTORY PROVISION IS COMMONLY CALLED THE VOLCKER RULE. IN DECEMBER 2013, FEDERAL REGULATORS ADOPTED FINAL RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE VOLCKER RULE. THE FINAL RULES ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, AND MANY ASPECTS OF THEIR

APPLICATION REMAIN UNCERTAIN. THE FINAL RULES ALSO REQUIRE THAT LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE ADHERENCE TO THE VOLCKER RULES PROHIBITIONS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO EVALUATE

THE EFFECTS OF THE FINAL RULES, BUT WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE VOLCKER RULE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. DEVELOPMENT AND MONITORING OF THE REQUIRED COMPLIANCE PROGRAM, HOWEVER, MAY REQUIRE THE EXPENDITURE OF

SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT ATTENTION.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND EXTENSIVE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

DODD-FRANK IMPOSES HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS ON BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY, AND REQUIRES THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ESTABLISH PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR SUCH LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE APPLICABLE TO OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR RISK-BASED CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS AND LEVERAGE LIMITS, LIQUIDITY, RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS, RESOLUTION PLANS (REFERRED TO AS LIVING WILLS), STRESS TESTS, EARLY REMEDIATION, CREDIT EXPOSURE REPORTING AND CONCENTRATION. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS

DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS ON ITS OWN, OR AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (FSOC), REGARDING CONTINGENT CAPITAL, ENHANCED PUBLIC DISCLOSURES, SHORT-TERM DEBT

LIMITS AND OTHERWISE AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY, ON ITS OWN VOLITION OR IN RESPONSE TO A RECOMMENDATION BY THE FSOC, TAILOR THE APPLICATION OF THESE ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS TO SPECIFIC COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE

COMPANY, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THESE ENHANCED STANDARDS ON THE COMPANY IS NOT CERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DEPENDING ON THE APPLICATION OF THESE STANDARDS TO US AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ISSUED SEVERAL PROPOSED AND FINAL RULES UNDER ITS AUTHORITY TO

ESTABLISH SUCH ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE STRESS TESTING AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES DISCUSSED BELOW. IN ADDITION, ON FEBRUARY 18, 2014, THE FEDERAL RESERVE APPROVED A FINAL RULE IMPLEMENTING SEVERAL

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



ENHANCED LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.

THE FEDERAL RESERVES RULE FOCUSES ON PRUDENTIAL STEPS TO MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH

COMPREHENSIVELY DETAIL LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AND REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAINTENANCE OF A LIQUIDITY BUFFER, CONSISTING OF ASSETS MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS, THAT IS SUFFICIENT

TO MEET PROJECTED NET CASH OUTFLOWS AND PROJECTED LOSS OR IMPAIRMENT OF EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES FOR 30 DAYS OVER A RANGE OF LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIOS. TO COMPLEMENT THESE LIQUIDITY STANDARDS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE OTHER FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATORS ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE IN OCTOBER 2013 TO IMPLEMENT THE LIQUIDITY FRAMEWORK DERIVED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL LIQUIDITY STANDARDS INCORPORATED INTO THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK. SEE 

CAPITAL ADEQUACY  LIQUIDITY RATIOS UNDER BASEL

III

 BELOW.



ENHANCED RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, AND PUBLICLY TRADED BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES WITH $10 BILLION OR MORE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A DEDICATED RISK COMMITTEE REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

WHICH WOULD REVIEW AND APPROVE THE ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES OF THE COMPANY. THE RISK COMMITTEE IS REQUIRED TO HAVE AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, AT LEAST ONE RISK MANAGEMENT EXPERT AND OVERSIGHT OF THE OPERATION OF

AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK COMMENSURATE WITH THE COMPANYS CAPITAL STRUCTURE, RISK PROFILE, COMPLEXITY, ACTIVITIES, SIZE AND OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK-RELATED FACTORS, AND IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN

THE RULE. SUCH BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO APPOINT A CHIEF RISK OFFICER. WE HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED SUCH A RISK COMMITTEE AND APPOINTED A CHIEF RISK OFFICER.

WHILE THE FINAL RULE ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE LARGELY IMPLEMENTS THE DECEMBER 2011 PROPOSALS REGARDING LIQUIDITY AND RISK

MANAGEMENT, THE FINAL RULE DOES NOT ADDRESS THE FEDERAL RESERVES PROPOSALS REGARDING SINGLE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT EXPOSURE OR EARLY REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO REVIEW THE FINAL RULE AND ASSESS ITS IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE FINAL RULE, WE ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO FULLY COMPLY WITH LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2015.

STRESS TESTING

AS PART OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ENHANCED PRUDENTIAL

REQUIREMENTS OF DODD-FRANK, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED RULES RELATING TO SUPERVISORY AND COMPANY-RUN ANALYSES OF CERTAIN LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE COMPANIES HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL ON A TOTAL CONSOLIDATED BASIS NECESSARY

TO ABSORB LOSSES AS A RESULT OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (SO-CALLED STRESS TESTS). THE FEDERAL RESERVE APPLIES ITS STRESS TESTS RULES AND ITS CAPITAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS, DISCUSSED IN 

CAPITAL PLANNING

 BELOW, ON A

CONSOLIDATED BASIS.



SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTING.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST CONDUCT ANNUAL STRESS TESTS OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY. UNDER THIS RULE, THE STRESS TESTS USE A MINIMUM OF THREE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SCENARIOS GENERATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE (BASELINE, ADVERSE AND SEVERELY ADVERSE), AND ARE BASED ON METHODOLOGIES AND DATA

THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAKES AVAILABLE TO COMPANIES NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR. A SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL STRESS TESTS WILL BE MADE PUBLIC BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON A COMPANY-SPECIFIC BASIS.



COMPANY STRESS TESTING.

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO

CONDUCT A SIMILAR STRESS TEST ON A SEMIANNUAL BASIS. A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF EACH OF THESE TESTS MUST BE PUBLICLY DISCLOSED.

THE FDIC AND THE OCC HAVE ALSO ISSUED RULES CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVES REGULATIONS GOVERNING COMPANY-CONDUCTED STRESS TESTING TO IMPLEMENT ANNUAL COMPANY STRESS TESTING REQUIREMENTS

APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT THE RESULTS OF THEIR STRESS TESTS IN 2015.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAPITAL PLANNING

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A SO-CALLED CAPITAL PLAN, AND TO SUBMIT THE CAPITAL

PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR REVIEW UNDER ITS COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) PROCESS. THE CAPITAL PLAN MUST COVER A PLANNING HORIZON OF AT LEAST NINE QUARTERS (BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER PRECEDING THE

SUBMISSION OF THE PLAN) AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS.



AN ASSESSMENT OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS EXPECTED USES AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL OVER THE PLANNING HORIZON THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE BANK HOLDING

COMPANYS SIZE, COMPLEXITY, RISK PROFILE AND SCOPE OF OPERATIONS, AND UNDER EXPECTED AND STRESSFUL CONDITIONS ACCORDING TO SCENARIOS DEVELOPED BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE;

CONDITIONS, MAINTAIN CAPITAL COMMENSURATE WITH ITS RISKS, ABOVE THE MINIMUM REGULATORY RATIOS, AND TO SERVE AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ITS SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, AND SUFFICIENT TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS BY MAINTAINING STEADY ACCESS TO

FUNDING, MEETING OBLIGATIONS TO CREDITORS AND OTHER COUNTERPARTIES AND CONTINUING TO SERVE AS A CREDIT INTERMEDIARY;



THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS CAPITAL POLICY; AND



A DISCUSSION OF ANY EXPECTED CHANGES TO THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BUSINESS.

EACH CAPITAL PLAN MUST CONSIDER A MINIMUM OF FOUR PLANNING SCENARIOS, INCLUDING SEPARATE BASELINE AND STRESSED SCENARIOS DEVELOPED BY THE

BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE SEVERELY ADVERSE STRESS SCENARIO DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR THE 2014 PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO REPRESENT AN OUTCOME THAT, IN THE OPINION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, IS UNLIKELY, BUT COULD OCCUR IF

THE U.S. ECONOMY WERE TO EXPERIENCE A DEEP RECESSION WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIES WERE ALSO TO CONTRACT SIGNIFICANTLY. IN ADDITION TO OTHER LIMITATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO MAKE ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS (INCLUDING

DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES) IS CONTINGENT ON THE FEDERAL RESERVES APPROVAL OR NON-OBJECTION TO OUR CAPITAL PLAN UNDER BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE TESTS. LIKEWISE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ANY CAPITAL ACTIONS

SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO INCLUDE ANY INTENDED ACTION IN ITS CAPITAL PLAN.

A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

OR A DESIGNATED COMMITTEE THEREOF, IS REQUIRED, AT LEAST ANNUALLY, TO REVIEW THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS PROCESS FOR ASSESSING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, ENSURE THAT ANY DEFICIENCIES ARE REMEDIED AND APPROVE THE CAPITAL

PLAN.

IN ITS REVIEW OF THE CAPITAL PLAN, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL CONSIDER THE PLANS COMPREHENSIVENESS, THE

REASONABLENESS OF ITS ASSUMPTIONS AND ANALYSIS, AND THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS METHODOLOGIES FOR REVIEWING THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY PROCESS AND ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL ABOVE MINIMUM REGULATORY RATIOS UNDER EXPECTED AND

STRESSFUL CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE PLANNING HORIZON. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ENGAGE IN A QUALITATIVE REVIEW OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES. BASED ON ITS OVERALL REVIEW AND THE REGULATORY

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL EITHER OBJECT OR NOT OBJECT TO THE CAPITAL PLAN. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BROAD AUTHORITY TO OBJECT TO CAPITAL PLANS, AND TO REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO REVISE AND RESUBMIT THEIR

CAPITAL PLANS FOR APPROVAL. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AN ONGOING REQUIREMENT TO REVISE AND RESUBMIT THEIR CAPITAL PLANS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS SPECIFIED BY RULE, OR WHEN REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IF A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY RECEIVES AN OBJECTION TO ITS CAPITAL PLAN, IT MUST RESUBMIT A REVISED PLAN WITHIN 30 DAYS. SHOULD THE FEDERAL RESERVE OBJECT TO A CAPITAL PLAN, A BANK HOLDING COMPANY MAY NOT MAKE ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION OTHER THAN THOSE CAPITAL

DISTRIBUTIONS THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED NON-OBJECTION TO IN WRITING.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT IT

INTENDS TO PUBLISH THE RESULTS OF ITS SUPERVISORY STRESS TEST FOR THE PORTION OF EACH BANK HOLDING COMPANYS CAPITAL PLAN THAT RELATES TO THE ADVERSE AND SEVERELY ADVERSE STRESS SCENARIOS DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THE INFORMATION TO BE

RELEASED WILL INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FEDERAL RESERVES PROJECTION OF COMPANY-SPECIFIC INFORMATION, INCLUDING POST-STRESS CAPITAL RATIOS AND THE MINIMUM VALUE OF THESE RATIOS OVER THE PLANNING HORIZON.

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS NOTED THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WILL HAVE

LIMITED ABILITY TO ADJUST DOWNWARD PLANNED CAPITAL ACTIONS IN LIGHT OF STRESS TEST RESULTS. SHOULD ANY ADJUSTMENT OCCUR, THE FEDERAL RESERVE INTENDS TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THE RESULTS OF STRESS TESTS USING BOTH THE ORIGINAL AND ADJUSTED 2014 CAPITAL

PLANS. ADDITIONALLY, IN SEPTEMBER 2013, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED AN INTERIM FINAL RULE AMENDING ITS CAPITAL PLAN AND STRESS TEST RULES TO CLARIFY HOW BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH OVER $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE

RECENTLY ADOPTED NEW CAPITAL RULES (AS DEFINED BELOW) FOR THE 2014 CCAR PROCESS AND THE SUPERVISORY AND COMPANY RUN STRESS TESTS. UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVES INTERIM FINAL RULE SUCH BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, MUST BOTH.

(1) PROJECT ITS REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS AND MEET THE REQUIRED MINIMUMS UNDER THE NEW CAPITAL RULES FOR EACH QUARTER OF THE NINE-QUARTER PLANNING HORIZON IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN EFFECT DURING THAT

QUARTER, SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATE PHASE-INS/PHASE-OUTS UNDER THE NEW RULES; AND (2) CONTINUE TO MEET THE MINIMUM 5 PERCENT TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY RATIO AS CALCULATED UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY GENERALLY APPLICABLE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES.

ON JANUARY 6, 2014, WE SUBMITTED OUR CAPITAL PLAN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE. WE EXPECT A RESPONSE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE DURING THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2014.

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANY AND TRS, AS WELL AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ARE LIMITED BY BANKING STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISORY POLICY IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN GENERAL, FEDERAL AND APPLICABLE STATE

BANKING LAWS PROHIBIT, WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL, INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM MAKING DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS IF SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT PAID OUT OF AVAILABLE RECENT EARNINGS OR WOULD

CAUSE THE INSTITUTION TO FAIL TO MEET CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS. AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER 

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

, THE FDIA ALSO GENERALLY PROHIBITS AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FROM MAKING ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION

(INCLUDING PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS) OR PAYING ANY MANAGEMENT FEE TO ITS HOLDING COMPANY IF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD THEREAFTER BE UNDERCAPITALIZED. IN ADDITION TO SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS ON THE DIVIDENDS THAT SUBSIDIARY BANKS CAN PAY TO THEIR

HOLDING COMPANIES, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND TRS TO SHAREHOLDERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IT IS FEDERAL RESERVE

POLICY THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY SHOULD PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS GENERATED OVER THE PAST YEAR AND ONLY IF PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

ORGANIZATIONS CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY AND OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED, HOWEVER, THAT CAPITAL PLANS IMPLYING DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIOS ABOVE 30 PERCENT OF PROJECTED AFTER-TAX NET

INCOME WILL RECEIVE PARTICULARLY CLOSE SCRUTINY. MOREOVER, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN DIVIDEND LEVELS THAT PLACE UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE CAPITAL OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES OR THAT MAY UNDERMINE THE BANK HOLDING

COMPANYS ABILITY TO BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND BY THE COMPANY OR TRS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE

BANKING ORGANIZATION.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH MORE THAN $50 BILLION IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, ITS

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS IS SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO INCLUDE PROJECTED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN THE CAPITAL PLAN REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE, DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER 

CAPITAL

PLANNING

, AND THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED AS PART OF THE CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS WILL LIKELY BE THE PRINCIPAL LIMITATION ON OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS (INCLUDING DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES). IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

GENERALLY IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PRIOR APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE IT CAN MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, UNDER ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DISTRIBUTION IS PART OF A CAPITAL PLAN

TO WHICH THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS NOT OBJECTED).



THE COMPANY WILL NOT MEET A MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIO OR A TIER 1 COMMON EQUITY RATIO OF AT LEAST 5 PERCENT AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE CAPITAL

DISTRIBUTION;

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS



THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS NOTIFIED THE COMPANY THAT IT HAS DETERMINED THAT EITHER (I) THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION WILL RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE

CHANGE TO THE COMPANYS CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY STRUCTURE, OR (II) THE COMPANYS EARNINGS ARE MATERIALLY UNDERPERFORMING PROJECTIONS;



THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION WILL EXCEED THE PROJECTED DISTRIBUTION DESCRIBED IN THE COMPANYS APPROVED CAPITAL PLAN; OR



THE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION WILL OCCUR AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT REQUIRING THE RESUBMISSION (OTHER THAN PURSUANT TO AN OBJECTION) OF THE

COMPANYS CAPITAL PLAN AND BEFORE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ACTED ON THE RESUBMITTED PLAN.

LIVING WILLS

IN DECEMBER 2013, WE FILED OUR INITIAL PLAN FOR THE RAPID AND ORDERLY RESOLUTION OF THE COMPANY UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE

IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE. UNDER RULES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, WE ARE REQUIRED TO UPDATE THIS PLAN ANNUALLY AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO UPDATE IT UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF MATERIAL CHANGES IN

OUR BUSINESS, STRUCTURE OR OPERATIONS. THIS RESOLUTION PLANNING REQUIREMENT MAY, AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, PRESENT ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON OUR STRUCTURE, OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS STRATEGY, AND ON TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN OUR BANK

AND NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES, BECAUSE WE MUST CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF THESE MATTERS ON OUR ABILITY TO PREPARE AND SUBMIT A RESOLUTION PLAN THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT WE MAY BE RESOLVED UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE IN A RAPID AND ORDERLY MANNER. IF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE AND THE FDIC DETERMINE THAT OUR PLAN IS NOT CREDIBLE AND WE FAIL TO CURE THE DEFICIENCIES, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL, LEVERAGE OR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, OR RESTRICTIONS ON OUR GROWTH, ACTIVITIES OR OPERATIONS, OR

ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED TO DIVEST CERTAIN ASSETS OR OPERATIONS TO FACILITATE AN ORDERLY RESOLUTION.

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO BANKING LAWS AND REGULATIONS

THAT LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS. IN ADDITION, ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF OUR REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC AND THE FDIC. THE BANKING AGENCIES HAVE BROAD DISCRETION

IN EVALUATING PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS. IN DECIDING WHETHER TO APPROVE AN ACQUISITION, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS MAY CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, EFFECTS OF THE ACQUISITION ON COMPETITION, FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL RESOURCES, AND

FINANCIAL STABILITY; FUTURE PROSPECTS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL RATIOS AND LEVELS; THE COMPETENCE AND EXPERTISE OF MANAGEMENT AND OUR RECORD OF COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS; PUBLIC BENEFITS; THE CONVENIENCE AND NEEDS OF THE

COMMUNITY AND OUR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES RECORD OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CRA; RISKS TO THE STABILITY OF THE U.S. BANKING OR FINANCIAL SYSTEM; AND OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING.

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BHC ACT REQUIRES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE: (1) IT

MAY ACQUIRE DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, IF AFTER SUCH ACQUISITION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WILL DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWN OR CONTROL MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF ANY CLASS OF

THE VOTING SECURITIES OF THE INSTITUTION; (2) IT OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OTHER THAN A BANK, MAY ACQUIRE ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION (THE BANK MERGER ACT REQUIRES REGULATORY APPROVAL

BEFORE A BANK SUBSIDIARY MAY MAKE SUCH AN ACQUISITION); OR (3) IT MAY MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH ANY OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST APPROVE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO AN EXISTING NON-U.S. INVESTMENT AND CERTAIN DIRECT AND INDIRECT ACQUISITIONS BY THE COMPANY OF AN INTEREST IN A NON-U.S.

COMPANY, INCLUDING IN A FOREIGN BANK. DODD-FRANK REQUIRES BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN $50 BILLION TO PROVIDE THE FEDERAL RESERVE WITH WRITTEN NOTICE (WHICH IS LARGELY TANTAMOUNT TO AN APPROVAL

PROCESS) PRIOR TO ACQUIRING DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF ANY COMPANY (OTHER THAN AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION) THAT IS ENGAGED IN FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN SECTION 4(K) OF THE BHC ACT AND THAT HAS

TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $10 BILLION OR MORE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. DODD-FRANK

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALSO REQUIRES FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES TO OBTAIN FEDERAL RESERVE APPROVAL PRIOR TO ACQUIRING ANY NON-BANK COMPANY WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS IN EXCESS OF $10 BILLION.

APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS ALSO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF PERSONS TO INVEST IN OR ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY WITHOUT PROVIDING

NOTICE TO OR OBTAINING THE APPROVAL OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR REGULATORS. THE CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL ACT PROHIBITS A PERSON, ENTITY, OR GROUP OF PERSONS OR ENTITIES ACTING IN CONCERT, FROM DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ACQUIRING CONTROL OF A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY SUCH AS THE COMPANY, UNLESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BEEN GIVEN PRIOR NOTICE AND HAS NOT OBJECTED TO THE TRANSACTION. UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS, THE ACQUISITION OF 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF A CLASS OF VOTING STOCK OF THE COMPANY

WOULD GENERALLY CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF THE COMPANY AND REQUIRE PRIOR NOTICE TO AND NON-OBJECTION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE BHC ACT, ANY PERSON OR COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL

OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE ACQUIRING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OF OR CONTROL OVER 25 PERCENT OR MORE OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY OR THE POWER TO EXERCISE A

CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER THE COMPANY. IN THE CASE OF AN ACQUIRER THAT IS A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE BHC ACT REQUIRES APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SECURITIES OF THE

COMPANY, IF THE ACQUISITION RESULTS IN THE BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY CONTROLLING MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY.

SOURCE OF STRENGTH

BANK HOLDING COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTE TO ACT

AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ALL OF THEIR INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO

SUPPORT BOTH INSTITUTIONS. SUCH SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED AT TIMES WHEN, ABSENT THIS REQUIREMENT, THE COMPANY OTHERWISE MIGHT DETERMINE NOT TO PROVIDE IT.

CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE EVENT OF A BANK

HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANKING REGULATOR TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK WILL BE ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY

THE

COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES ESTABLISHED BY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS. THESE RULES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANKS (COLLECTIVELY,

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS) HAVE ADEQUATE CAPITAL GIVEN THE LEVEL OF ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS, AND TO MINIMIZE DISINCENTIVES FOR HOLDING LIQUID ASSETS.

SINCE THE LATE 1980S, THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES HAVE BEEN BASED ON ACCORDS AGREED TO BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE BASEL COMMITTEE).

THESE FRAMEWORKS INCLUDE GENERAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES APPLICABLE TO ALL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS BASED ON THE 1988 CAPITAL ACCORD, KNOWN AS BASEL I, AND RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES APPLICABLE TO BANKING ORGANIZATIONS HAVING $250 BILLION OR MORE IN

TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OR $10 BILLION OR MORE IN FOREIGN EXPOSURES, KNOWN AS ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTIONS, BASED ON THE ADVANCED INTERNAL RATINGS-BASED APPROACH FOR CREDIT RISK AND THE ADVANCED MEASUREMENT APPROACH FOR OPERATIONAL RISK IN THE

REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE IN JUNE 2006, KNOWN AS BASEL II.

IN JULY 2013, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ADOPTED RULES (THE NEW CAPITAL RULES) SUBSTANTIALLY REVISING THE GENERAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES PREVIOUSLY APPLICABLE TO BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TO

MAKE THEM MORE RISK SENSITIVE AND IMPLEMENTING THE FINAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REGULATION, KNOWN AS BASEL III, RELEASED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE IN DECEMBER 2010. THE NEW CAPITAL RULES ARE CURRENTLY BEING

PHASED-IN AND, SUBJECT TO TRANSITION PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL, WILL BEGIN TO

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TAKE EFFECT FOR ALL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2015. AS AN ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTION, THE COMPANY AND, CONSEQUENTLY, EACH OF TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO

COMPLY WITH PORTIONS OF THE NEW CAPITAL RULES BEGINNING IN 2014, SPECIFICALLY THE REVISED CAPITAL DEFINITIONS AND MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS, WHILE STILL USING BASEL I RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CAPITAL RATIOS, SEE CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY ON PAGES 35-37

OF OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

NEW CAPITAL RULES.

UNDER THE NEW CAPITAL RULES, NEW MINIMUM CAPITAL AND BUFFER REQUIREMENTS WERE ESTABLISHED AND WILL BE FULLY PHASED-IN BY 2019. SPECIFICALLY, BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM RATIOS FOR COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1),

TIER 1 AND TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. IN ADDITION, ALL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET ASSETS. ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTIONS WILL ALSO BECOME SUBJECT TO A

SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO. FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THESE RATIOS, A BANKING ORGANIZATIONS CAPITAL IS CLASSIFIED INTO THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.



COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL.

CET1 INCLUDES COMMON EQUITY, RETAINED EARNINGS AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MINORITY INTERESTS IN CET1 OF CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES.



ADDITIONAL TIER 1 CAPITAL.

ADDITIONAL TIER 1 CAPITAL INCLUDES NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MINORITY

INTERESTS IN ADDITIONAL TIER 1 CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW CAPITAL RULES.



TIER 2 CAPITAL.

TIER 2 CAPITAL INCLUDES CERTAIN SUBORDINATED DEBT, PREFERRED STOCK THAT IS CUMULATIVE OR HAS A MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE AND A

LIMITED AMOUNT OF MINORITY INTERESTS IN TIER 2 CAPITAL OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW CAPITAL RULES.

THE INCLUSION IN A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ADDITIONAL TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND THE INCLUSION IN A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS TIER 1 CAPITAL OF CUMULATIVE

PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, IN EACH CASE ISSUED PRIOR TO MAY 19, 2010 (AND BOTH INCLUDED IN A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS TIER 1 CAPITAL UNDER THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RULES AS IN EFFECT PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2015), WILL BE COMPLETELY

PHASED-OUT ON JANUARY 1, 2015. ADDITIONALLY, THE NEW CAPITAL RULES ALSO REQUIRE THE DEDUCTION OF CERTAIN ASSETS FROM CET1 (DEFERRED TAX ASSETS DEPENDENT UPON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL FIRMS AND

PENSION ASSETS, AMONG OTHERS, WITHIN PRESCRIBED LIMITATIONS) AND THE INCLUSION OF ACCUMULATED OCI IN CAPITAL. GOODWILL AND MOST INTANGIBLE ASSETS WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A FULL DEDUCTION FROM CET1.

A BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ASSETS AND SOME OF ITS SPECIFIED OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARE ALSO ASSIGNED TO VARIOUS

RISK CATEGORIES FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE REQUIRED RISK-BASED RATIOS. THE NEW CAPITAL RULES AMEND AND REPLACE THE CURRENT RISK-WEIGHTING CATEGORIES USED TO CALCULATE RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS IN THE DENOMINATOR OF CAPITAL RATIOS WITH A BROADER

ARRAY OF RISK WEIGHTING CATEGORIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE MORE RISK SENSITIVE BASED ON THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH PROPOSED BY BASEL II. THE NEW RISK-WEIGHTS FOR THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH RANGE FROM 0 PERCENT TO 600 PERCENT COMPARED WITH THE

RISK-WEIGHTS OF 0 PERCENT TO 100 PERCENT, IN GENERAL, IN THE REGULATORS EXISTING GENERAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES. HIGHER RISK-WEIGHTS WOULD APPLY TO A VARIETY OF EXPOSURES, INCLUDING CERTAIN SECURITIZATION EXPOSURES, EQUITY

EXPOSURES, CLAIMS ON SECURITIES FIRMS AND EXPOSURES TO COUNTERPARTIES ON OTC DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, ADVANCED APPROACHES BANKING ORGANIZATIONS WILL CALCULATE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BOTH THE GENERALLY APPLICABLE STANDARDIZED APPROACH AND

THE ADVANCED APPROACHES RULE, AND THEN USE THE LOWER OF EACH CAPITAL RATIO TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT MEETS ITS MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE PORTIONS OF THE NEW CAPITAL RULES IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH BECOME EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2015.

DURING 2014, WE WILL BEGIN REPORTING OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS ON A PARALLEL BASIS TO FEDERAL

BANKING REGULATORS USING BOTH RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS CALCULATED UNDER THE CURRENT BASEL I-BASED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, AS ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN ITEMS, AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTION. THE PARALLEL PERIOD WILL

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTINUE UNTIL WE RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL TO EXIT PARALLEL REPORTING, AT WHICH POINT WE WILL BEGIN PUBLICLY REPORTING CAPITAL RATIOS USING RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS CALCULATED UNDER THE HIGHER OF

THE ADVANCED APPROACHES AND THE STANDARDIZED APPROACHES IN THE NEW CAPITAL RULES.

DURING THE 2014 CALENDAR YEAR, WHILE THE

NEW CAPITAL RULES ARE BEING PHASED-IN, THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB MUST EACH MAINTAIN CET1, TIER 1 CAPITAL (THAT IS, CET1 PLUS ADDITIONAL TIER 1 CAPITAL) AND TOTAL CAPITAL (THAT IS, TIER 1 CAPITAL PLUS TIER 2 CAPITAL) RATIOS OF AT

LEAST 4.0 PERCENT, 5.5 PERCENT AND 8.0 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2015, HOWEVER, ALL APPLICABLE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS MUST MAINTAIN CET1, TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS OF AT LEAST 4.5 PERCENT, 6.0 PERCENT AND 8.0 PERCENT,

RESPECTIVELY, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER OR DEDUCTIONS FROM REGULATORY CAPITAL DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE NEW CAPITAL RULES ALSO IMPLEMENT A 2.5 PERCENT CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF CET1, ON TOP OF THESE MINIMUM RISK-WEIGHTED ASSET RATIOS. AS A RESULT, THE MINIMUM RATIOS ARE

EFFECTIVELY 7.0 PERCENT, 8.5 PERCENT AND 10.5 PERCENT FOR THE CET1, TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS, RESPECTIVELY, ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER WILL BEGIN ON JANUARY 1, 2016 AT THE 0.625

PERCENT LEVEL AND WILL INCREASE IN EQUAL INCREMENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR UNTIL IT IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED ON JANUARY 1, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, THE REQUIRED MINIMUM CET1, TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TOTAL CAPITAL RATIOS FOR ADVANCED APPROACHES

INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE COMPANY MAY BE FURTHER INCREASED BY A COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF CET1 UP TO 2.5 PERCENT, WHICH MAY BE ASSESSED WHEN FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS DETERMINE THAT SUCH A BUFFER IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE

BANKING SYSTEM FROM DISORDERLY DOWNTURNS ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESSIVELY EXPANSIONARY PERIODS. WHEN FULLY PHASED-IN, THE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER AND CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 5.0 PERCENT BEING

ADDED TO EACH OF THE RATIOS OF CET1, TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.

BANKING INSTITUTIONS WHOSE

RATIO OF CET1, TIER 1 CAPITAL OR TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS IS ABOVE THE MINIMUM BUT BELOW THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER (OR BELOW THE COMBINED CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER AND COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, WHEN THE LATTER IS APPLIED)

WILL FACE CONSTRAINTS ON DISCRETIONARY DISTRIBUTIONS SUCH AS DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF CAPITAL SECURITIES, AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF THE SHORTFALL.

AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS EXPECT MOST BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, AND IN PARTICULAR LARGER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

SUCH AS THE COMPANY, TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS THAT, AT A MINIMUM, QUALIFY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL CAPITALIZED. THE RULES ALSO PROVIDE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

EXPERIENCING INTERNAL GROWTH OR MAKING ACQUISITIONS WILL BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN STRONG CAPITAL POSITIONS SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE MINIMUM SUPERVISORY LEVELS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT RELIANCE ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FOLLOWING THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS,

FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE ENCOURAGED LARGER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL RATIOS APPRECIABLY ABOVE THE WELL CAPITALIZED STANDARD. MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS FOCUSING MORE ON THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENT THAT COMMON

EQUITY BE THE PREDOMINANT ELEMENT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. FURTHERMORE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL CONSIDER A TANGIBLE TIER 1 CAPITAL LEVERAGE RATIO (DEDUCTING ALL INTANGIBLES) AND OTHER INDICATORS OF CAPITAL

STRENGTH IN EVALUATING PROPOSALS FOR EXPANSION OR NEW ACTIVITIES.

IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE BASEL COMMITTEE SUPPLEMENTED BASEL

III BY ISSUING FINAL PROVISIONS APPLYING A NEW CET1 SURCHARGE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS (G-SIBS). IN A COMPANION RELEASE ADDRESSING PROGRESS ON A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORMS RELATING TO GLOBAL

SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD RELEASED A LIST OF 29 SUCH INSTITUTIONS AND INDICATED THAT IT USED THE

G-SIB

SURCHARGE METHODOLOGY IN CREATING THE LIST. THE COMPANY

WAS NOT INCLUDED ON EITHER THE ORIGINAL OR REVISED LISTS OF G-SIBS RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 2012 AND NOVEMBER 2013.

IN OCTOBER

2012, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ISSUED FINAL RULES INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT THE G-SIB FRAMEWORK BY IMPOSING A CET1 SURCHARGE ON CERTAIN BANKS THAT MAY NOT BE SIGNIFICANT FROM AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE, BUT

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEVERTHELESS HAVE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT ON THEIR DOMESTIC ECONOMIES (D-SIBS). THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES A MINIMUM SET OF PRINCIPLES AGAINST WHICH THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS WOULD

EVALUATE WHETHER A BANK IS A D-SIB AND DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL THAT A D-SIB IS REQUIRED TO HOLD AND/OR WHETHER THE D-SIB SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO OTHER POLICY TOOLS. HOWEVER, THE NEW CAPITAL RULES DO NOT INDICATE WHETHER ANY, OR TO WHAT EXTENT,

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS G-SIBS MAY BE SUBJECT TO A D-SIB SURCHARGE. IN LINE WITH THE BASEL COMMITTEES STATED OBJECTIVE THAT THE D-SIB FRAMEWORK COMPLEMENT THE G-SIB FRAMEWORK, THE D-SIB SURCHARGE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED

TOGETHER WITH THE G-SIB SURCHARGE BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2016. WHILE THE NEW CAPITAL RULES DID NOT ADDRESS THE ADOPTION OF THE SURCHARGE ON G-SIBS OR D-SIBS, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS NOTED THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING A CAPITAL SURCHARGE FOR

INSTITUTIONS WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, OR SOME SUBSET OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS, CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL COMMITTEES SURCHARGE PROPOSALS.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS.

BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS. THE LEVERAGE RATIO IS THE RATIO OF A BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TIER 1 CAPITAL TO

ITS TOTAL ADJUSTED QUARTERLY AVERAGE ASSETS (AS DEFINED FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES). THE EXISTING RULES REQUIRE A MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3.0 PERCENT FOR BANKING ORGANIZATIONS THAT MEET CERTAIN SPECIFIED CRITERIA, INCLUDING HAVING THE HIGHEST

REGULATORY RATING. ALL OTHER BANKING ORGANIZATIONS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 4.0 PERCENT. THE NEW CAPITAL RULES ELIMINATE THE 3.0 PERCENT MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FOR HIGHLY-RATED BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE

CONSEQUENCE THAT ALL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 4.0 PERCENT AS OF JANUARY 1, 2015. THE ELIMINATION OF THE 3.0 PERCENT MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO WITH RESPECT TO ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTIONS

BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2014.

THE NEW CAPITAL RULES ALSO ESTABLISH A SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT FOR

ADVANCED APPROACHES BANKING ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE COMPANY, CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK. THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO IS THE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AN EXPANDED CONCEPT OF LEVERAGE EXPOSURE THAT INCLUDES BOTH ON-BALANCE SHEET

AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES. THE NEW CAPITAL RULES REQUIRE A MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTAL LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3.0 PERCENT FOR ADVANCED APPROACHES BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, WITH REPORTING TO THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS COMMENCING JANUARY 1,

2015 AND FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE BY JANUARY 1, 2018.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS

ARE EACH INDEPENDENTLY CONSIDERING POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR TAKEN TOGETHER, COULD MAKE IT SUBSTANTIALLY MORE RESTRICTIVE. IN PARTICULAR, THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED REVISIONS TO THE

SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIOS DENOMINATOR, INCLUDING MODIFICATIONS REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVES. SEPARATELY, THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE PROPOSED REVISIONS TO THE SUPPLEMENTARY

LEVERAGE RATIO THAT WOULD INCREASE THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN HOLDING COMPANIES TO EXCEED 5 PERCENT. IN ADDITION, THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ESTABLISH A SUPPLEMENTAL LEVERAGE RATIO WELL CAPITALIZED THRESHOLD OF 6 PERCENT

FOR CERTAIN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION FRAMEWORK.

LIQUIDITY RATIOS UNDER BASEL

III

. HISTORICALLY, REGULATION AND MONITORING OF BANK AND BANK HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, WITHOUT REQUIRED FORMULAIC MEASURES. THE BASEL III FRAMEWORK

REQUIRES BANKS AND BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO MEASURE THEIR LIQUIDITY AGAINST SPECIFIC LIQUIDITY TESTS THAT, ALTHOUGH SIMILAR IN SOME RESPECTS TO LIQUIDITY MEASURES HISTORICALLY APPLIED BY BANKS AND REGULATORS FOR MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY PURPOSES,

GOING FORWARD WILL BE REQUIRED BY REGULATION. ONE TEST, REFERRED TO AS THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR), IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE BANKING ENTITY MAINTAINS AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF UNENCUMBERED HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS THAT CAN BE

CONVERTED INTO CASH TO MEET ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR A 30-DAY TIME HORIZON UNDER A SIGNIFICANTLY SEVERE LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO SPECIFIED BY SUPERVISORS. THE RATIO OF A FIRMS LIQUID ASSETS TO ITS PROJECTED NET OUTFLOWS IS ITS LCR. IN OCTOBER

2013, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE IMPLEMENTING THE LCR REQUIREMENT FOR ADVANCED APPROACHES BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AND THEIR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES WITH $10 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS, SUCH AS AEBSFB AND CENTURION BANK. UNDER THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS LCR PROPOSAL, COVERED BANKING ORGANIZATIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE LCR ON AN ACCELERATED SCHEDULE, MAINTAINING A MINIMUM OF 80 PERCENT OF THE

REQUIRED LCR BY JANUARY 1, 2015, 90 PERCENT BY JANUARY 1, 2016 AND 100 PERCENT BY JANUARY 1, 2017. THE COMMENT PERIOD ON THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS LCR PROPOSAL ENDED ON JANUARY 31, 2014.

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE OTHER TEST, REFERRED TO AS THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO (NSFR), IS DESIGNED

TO PROMOTE MORE MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM FUNDING OF THE ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES OF BANKING ENTITIES OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL INCENT BANKING ENTITIES TO INCREASE THEIR HOLDINGS OF CASH, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND OTHER

SOVEREIGN DEBT AS A COMPONENT OF ASSETS AND INCREASE THE USE OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS A FUNDING SOURCE. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS HAVE NOT YET PROPOSED RULES IMPLEMENTING THE NSFR LIQUIDITY FRAMEWORK FOR U.S. BANKING INSTITUTIONS. THE BASEL III

LIQUIDITY FRAMEWORK CONTEMPLATES THAT THE NSFR WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AS A MINIMUM STANDARD BY JANUARY 1, 2018.

THE FEDERAL

RESERVES PROPOSED HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS ALSO INCLUDE ENHANCED LIQUIDITY STANDARDS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER 

HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL

REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES

.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

THE FDIA REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) THAT DO NOT MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE FDIA SPECIFIES FIVE CAPITAL TIERS: WELL CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, UNDERCAPITALIZED,

SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED AND CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CAPITAL TIER DEPENDS UPON HOW ITS CAPITAL LEVELS COMPARE TO VARIOUS RELEVANT CAPITAL MEASURES AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS, AS

ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION. A BANK MAY BE DEEMED TO BE IN A CAPITALIZATION CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY ITS ACTUAL CAPITAL POSITION IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY EXAMINATION RATING. ONCE AN INSTITUTION BECOMES

UNDERCAPITALIZED, THE FDIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY MORE RESTRICTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE CAPITAL CATEGORY IN WHICH AN INSTITUTION IS CLASSIFIED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION THAT IS

NOT WELL CAPITALIZED IS ALSO SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE ACCEPTANCE OF BROKERED DEPOSITS INCLUDING CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT REGISTRY SERVICE DEPOSITS. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAS BEEN

RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CHANNELS, AND SUCH DEPOSITS ARE CONSIDERED BROKERED DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR DEPOSIT PROGRAMS, SEE DEPOSIT PROGRAMS UNDER U.S. CARD SERVICES  CONSUMER AND

SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES ABOVE AND DEPOSIT PROGRAMS ON PAGE 39 OF OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FROM MAKING ANY CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION (INCLUDING PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS)

OR PAYING ANY MANAGEMENT FEE TO ITS HOLDING COMPANY IF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD THEREAFTER BE UNDERCAPITALIZED. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON BORROWING FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND TO GROWTH

LIMITATIONS, AND ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN. FOR A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN TO BE ACCEPTABLE, ANY HOLDING COMPANY MUST GUARANTEE THE CAPITAL PLAN UP TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF 5 PERCENT OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AT THE TIME IT BECAME UNDERCAPITALIZED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL DEFICIENCY AT THE TIME IT FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE PLAN. IN THE EVENT OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, SUCH GUARANTEE WOULD TAKE PRIORITY OVER

CLAIMS OF ITS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS. IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FAILS TO SUBMIT AN ACCEPTABLE PLAN, IT IS TREATED AS IF IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED.

SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING ORDERS TO SELL SUFFICIENT VOTING STOCK TO BECOME ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED,

REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE TOTAL ASSETS AND CESSATION OF RECEIPT OF DEPOSITS FROM CORRESPONDENT BANKS. CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER OR CONSERVATOR.

EARLY REMEDIATION REGIME

DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EARLY REMEDIATION REGIME FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. IN JANUARY 2012, THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUBLISHED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING THAT INCLUDED A PROPOSED EARLY REMEDIATION SYSTEM BASED IN PART ON

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION REGIME THAT CURRENTLY APPLIES TO INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE FDIA. THE PROPOSED RULE, HOWEVER, UTILIZES FORWARD-LOOKING TRIGGERS BASED ON

CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE, STRESS TEST REQUIREMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT, LIQUIDITY AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET DATA. BECAUSE THESE RULES ARE NOT YET FINAL, THEIR ULTIMATE IMPACT ON US IS NOT CERTAIN.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING LOANS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) BETWEEN CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ON THE ONE

HAND, AND THEIR AFFILIATES (INCLUDING THE COMPANY, TRS AND THEIR NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES), ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE SUBJECT TO QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE LIMITATIONS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY STATUTE AND FEDERAL

RESERVE REGULATION. TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS. THESE RESTRICTIONS GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ACCEPT DEPOSITS AND THOSE DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE FDICS DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND (DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND) IS FUNDED BY

ASSESSMENTS ON INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

EACH INSTITUTIONS ASSESSMENTS ARE BASED ON THE AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED

TOTAL ASSETS LESS THE AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY OF THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD (THE ASSESSMENT BASE). THE ASSESSMENT RATE APPLICABLE TO LARGE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB,

IS ADJUSTED BASED UPON THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS RATIO OF (1) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT TO THE ASSESSMENT BASE, (2) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT ISSUED BY ANOTHER INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO THE ASSESSMENT BASE AND

(3) BROKERED DEPOSITS TO THE ASSESSMENT BASE. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR BROKERED DEPOSITS TO THE ASSESSMENT BASE DO NOT APPLY SO LONG AS THE INSTITUTION IS WELL CAPITALIZED AND HAS A COMPOSITE CAMELS RATING OF 1 OR 2. THE RULES PERMIT THE FDIC TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY ASSESSMENT RATE ADJUSTMENTS.

DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE FDIC TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM RESERVE RATIO

FOR THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND OF 1.35 PERCENT OF ESTIMATED INSURED DEPOSITS BY SEPTEMBER 30, 2020. ON DECEMBER 20, 2010, THE FDIC ISSUED A FINAL RULE SETTING THE INCREASED RESERVE RATIO AT 2 PERCENT. THIS RULE REPRESENTS AN INCREASE IN

THE RESERVE RATIO AND WILL RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK ELIMINATED THE CEILING (1.5 PERCENT OF INSURED DEPOSITS) ON THE SIZE OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND AND MADE THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS FROM THE

DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND BY THE FDIC DISCRETIONARY.

UNDER THE FDIA, THE FDIC MAY TERMINATE THE INSURANCE OF AN

INSTITUTIONS DEPOSITS UPON A FINDING THAT THE INSTITUTION HAS ENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICES, IS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS, OR HAS VIOLATED ANY APPLICABLE LAW, REGULATION, RULE, ORDER OR CONDITION IMPOSED

BY THE FDIC. WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY PRACTICE, CONDITION OR VIOLATION THAT MIGHT LEAD TO TERMINATION OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE AT EITHER OF OUR INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES.

FDIC POWERS UPON INSOLVENCY OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

IF

THE FDIC IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB, UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO

REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE

ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AND

CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF THE FDIC AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A PRIORITY OVER OTHER GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS AGAINST THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF DEBT HOLDERS OF THE INSTITUTION AND

DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES, IN THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION BY A RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB, THE DEBT HOLDERS AND

DEPOSITORS IN NON-U.S. OFFICES WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS, IF ANYTHING, THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY UNDER DODD-FRANK

DODD-FRANK CREATED

THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY (OLA), A RESOLUTION REGIME FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, UNDER WHICH THE TREASURY SECRETARY MAY APPOINT THE FDIC AS RECEIVER TO LIQUIDATE SUCH

A COMPANY IF THE COMPANY IS IN DANGER OF DEFAULT AND PRESENTS A SYSTEMIC RISK TO U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY. THIS DETERMINATION BY THE TREASURY SECRETARY MUST COME AFTER SUPERMAJORITY RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE FDIC AND

CONSULTATION BY THE TREASURY SECRETARY WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND AFTER CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS ARE MET. OLA IS SIMILAR TO THE FDIC RESOLUTION MODEL FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING GRANTING VERY BROAD POWERS TO THE FDIC AS

RECEIVER. THOUGH CREDITORS RIGHTS UNDER OLA WERE MODIFIED FROM THE FDIC REGIME TO REDUCE DISPARITIES IN TREATMENT BETWEEN OLA AND THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN THE TWO REGIMES, INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC

TO DISREGARD THE STRICT PRIORITY OF CREDITOR CLAIMS IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE USE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS PROCEDURE TO DETERMINE CREDITOR CLAIMS (AS OPPOSED TO THE JUDICIAL PROCEDURE USED IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS), AND THE RIGHT OF THE FDIC

TO TRANSFER CLAIMS TO A BRIDGE ENTITY.

DODD-FRANK ALSO ESTABLISHED AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND THAT MAY PROVIDE

LIQUIDITY TO THE RECEIVERSHIP OR A RELATED BRIDGE ENTITY IN AN OLA LIQUIDATION PROCEEDING. THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH BORROWINGS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY AND REPAID FROM THE ASSETS OF THE FAILED

FINANCIAL COMPANY AND, IF NECESSARY, RISK-BASED ASSESSMENTS MADE, FIRST, ON ENTITIES THAT RECEIVED MORE IN THE OLA PROCEEDING THAN THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IN A CHAPTER 7 LIQUIDATION TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH EXCESS AND, SECOND, ON BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $50 BILLION OR MORE, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AND ON CERTAIN OTHER NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES. IF AN ORDERLY LIQUIDATION IS TRIGGERED, THE COMPANY COULD FACE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE ORDERLY LIQUIDATION FUND. IT

IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF ANY SUCH FUTURE ASSESSMENTS.

THE FDIC HAS DEVELOPED A STRATEGY UNDER OLA, REFERRED

TO AS THE SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY OR SPOE STRATEGY, UNDER WHICH THE FDIC WOULD RESOLVE A FAILED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY BY TRANSFERRING ITS ASSETS (INCLUDING SHARES OF ITS OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES) AND, POTENTIALLY, VERY

LIMITED LIABILITIES TO A BRIDGE HOLDING COMPANY; UTILIZE THE RESOURCES OF THE FAILED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY TO RECAPITALIZE THE OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES; AND SATISFY THE CLAIMS OF UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE FAILED FINANCIAL HOLDING

COMPANY AND OTHER CLAIMANTS IN THE RECEIVERSHIP BY DELIVERING SECURITIES OF ONE OR MORE NEW FINANCIAL COMPANIES THAT WOULD EMERGE FROM THE BRIDGE HOLDING COMPANY. UNDER THIS STRATEGY, MANAGEMENT OF THE FAILED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BE

REPLACED AND SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS OF THE FAILED FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY WOULD BEAR THE LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE FAILURE. THE FDIC ISSUED A NOTICE IN DECEMBER 2013 DESCRIBING SOME ELEMENTS OF THE SPOE STRATEGY, AND SEEKING PUBLIC COMMENT TO

FURTHER DEVELOP THE STRATEGY.

CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISIONS

UNDER THE CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM, RECOVERY AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989

(FIRREA), INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MAY BE LIABLE TO THE FDIC WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOSS INCURRED OR REASONABLY ANTICIPATED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFAULT OF, OR FDIC

ASSISTANCE TO, ANY COMMONLY CONTROLLED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE COMMONLY CONTROLLED WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FIRREA CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE SUBJECT TO THE CRA, WHICH IMPOSES AFFIRMATIVE, ONGOING OBLIGATIONS ON DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MEET THE

CREDIT NEEDS OF THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS, CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFE AND SOUND OPERATION OF THE INSTITUTION. THE CRA REQUIRES AN INSTITUTIONS PRIMARY FEDERAL REGULATOR, AS PART OF THE EXAMINATION

PROCESS, TO ASSESS THE INSTITUTIONS RECORD IN MEETING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CRA, AND ALSO TO TAKE SUCH ASSESSMENT INTO ACCOUNT IN EVALUATING MERGER AND ACQUISITION PROPOSALS AND APPLICATIONS TO OPEN OR RELOCATE A BRANCH OFFICE. AEBFSB WAS

EXAMINED BY THE OCC FOR CRA COMPLIANCE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012 AND RECEIVED A SATISFACTORY CRA RATING. CENTURION BANK WAS EXAMINED BY THE FDIC DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013 AND IS AWAITING THE RESULTS OF THIS EXAMINATION. IN

ITS LAST EXAMINATION, CENTURION BANK RECEIVED A SATISFACTORY CRA RATING.

IN THE CASE OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY,

SUCH AS THE COMPANY AND TRS, APPLYING FOR APPROVAL TO ACQUIRE A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE RECORD OF EACH SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICANT BANK HOLDING COMPANY IN CONSIDERING THE APPLICATION.

IN ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANYS U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY CRA RATINGS COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANYS AND TRS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES IN RELIANCE ON

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AUTHORITY.

PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN POLICIES THAT PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION

AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS, MEET EVOLVING CUSTOMER PRIVACY EXPECTATIONS AND SUPPORT AND ENABLE BUSINESS INNOVATION AND GROWTH.

WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP AND MAKE AVAILABLE RELEVANT, PERSONALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THEIR INFORMATION, AND WE GIVE

THEM NOTICE REGARDING THE MEASURES WE TAKE TO SAFEGUARD THIS INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS.

REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS MEDIA AND PUBLIC FOCUS, IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY CONTINUES TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE, SPURRED BY ADVANCEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING MOBILE DEVICES), BROAD USE OF THE INTERNET, EXPANDING USES OF MOBILE COMMERCE AND SOCIAL NETWORKING, RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT THE RAPID AND WIDESPREAD COLLECTION, DISSEMINATION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND HIGHLY

PUBLICIZED SECURITY BREACHES AND CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS. OUR REGULATORS, INCLUDING REGULATORY EXAMINERS, ARE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT OUR PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY-RELATED POLICIES AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING THOSE

RELATED TO ACCESS CONTROLS, ARE ADEQUATE TO INFORM CONSUMERS OF OUR DATA COLLECTION, USE, SHARING AND/OR SECURITY PRACTICES, TO PROVIDE THEM WITH CHOICES, IF REQUIRED, ABOUT HOW WE USE AND SHARE THEIR INFORMATION, AND TO SAFEGUARD THEIR PERSONAL

INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS.

IN THE UNITED STATES,

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GLBA IMPOSES CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO SHARE

CONSUMERS NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES; REQUIRES THAT A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PROVIDE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS ABOUT ITS DATA COLLECTION, SHARING AND SECURITY PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT

TO OPT OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS), AND REQUIRES THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN

COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES AND THE SENSITIVITY OF CUSTOMER

INFORMATION PROCESSED BY THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE GLBA DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS THAT AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS. VARIOUS STATES ALSO HAVE ADOPTED LAWS, RULES AND/OR REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO PRIVACY AND/OR INFORMATION

SECURITY, INCLUDING CERTAIN POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE FINANCIAL PRIVACY LAWS (SUCH AS A LAW IN EFFECT IN CALIFORNIA); DATA SECURITY AND/OR DATA

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISPOSAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED IN STATES SUCH AS MASSACHUSETTS AND NEVADA); ONLINE PRIVACY LAWS (SUCH AS A LAW IN EFFECT IN CALIFORNIA); AND LAWS

RELATING TO THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF CERTAIN TYPES OF DATA (SUCH AS LAWS GOVERNING CERTAIN HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION AND/OR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, FOR WHICH THERE ARE ALSO POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS AND/OR GUIDANCE AS

WELL). CERTAIN OF THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY APPLY TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND/OR CONTRACTORS AS WELL AS OUR CUSTOMERS.

VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS, AND 46 U.S. STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAVE ENACTED DATA SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WITH VARYING LEVELS

OF INDIVIDUAL, CONSUMER, REGULATOR AND/OR LAW ENFORCEMENT NOTIFICATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE EVENT OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH. DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION LAWS ARE ALSO BECOMING MORE PREVALENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE OPERATE,

INCLUDING GERMANY, JAPAN, MEXICO, SOUTH KOREA AND TAIWAN. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION

AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY BREACH NOTIFICATION.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND

INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE (INCLUDING COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN, HONG KONG, MEXICO AND SINGAPORE), SOME OF WHICH ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN EUROPE, EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE

1995, PROVIDES FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA. THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE REQUIRES THE CONTROLLER AND/OR PROCESSOR OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STEPS TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. MORE RECENTLY, DIRECTIVE 2009/136/EC (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE E-PRIVACY DIRECTIVE OR COOKIES DIRECTIVE) INTRODUCED NEW

REQUIREMENTS ON THE COLLECTION AND USE OF DATA ABOUT INTERNET USERS AND REQUIRED MEMBER STATES TO ENACT NATIONAL LAWS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS. COMPLIANCE WITH DATA PROTECTION LAWS IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE COULD RESULT IN HIGHER TECHNOLOGY,

ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS FOR THE COMPANY AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OPTIMIZE THE USE OF OUR CLOSED-LOOP DATA.

THE

EUROPEAN COMMISSION RELEASED ON JANUARY 25, 2012 THE TEXT OF ITS DRAFT PROPOSED DATA PROTECTION FRAMEWORK REGULATION TO REPLACE THE EU DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE (95/46/EC). THE EU LEGISLATION PROCESS IS STILL ONGOING, HOWEVER IF ENACTED, THE

NEW REGULATION WILL AFFECT PARTIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, THAT COLLECT AND/OR PROCESS THE PERSONAL DATA OF RESIDENTS OF MEMBER STATES AND MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND COSTS. THE DRAFT GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION

PROPOSES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A REQUIREMENT FOR PROMPT NOTICE OF DATA BREACHES, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, TO DATA SUBJECTS AND SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES, APPLYING UNIFORMLY ACROSS SECTORS AND ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION AND PROPOSES SIGNIFICANT FINES

FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS REQUIREMENTS.

IN NOVEMBER 2012, WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE DATA

PROTECTION AUTHORITY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM OF OUR BINDING CORPORATE RULES (BCR) FOR TRANSFERRING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA COUNTRIES TO AMERICAN EXPRESS GROUP COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THIS APPROVAL BECAME EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 28, 2013. FOLLOWING A CONSULTATION PROCESS BETWEEN THE U.K. AUTHORITY AND THE DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED THE FORMAL APPROVAL FOR OUR BCR IN THE FOLLOWING COUNTRIES: BELGIUM, CZECH

REPUBLIC, DENMARK, FINLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, IRELAND, ITALY, LUXEMBOURG, NORWAY, SPAIN, SWEDEN AND THE NETHERLANDS.

WE

CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE PERSONAL INFORMATION ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS, AND OUR INTERNAL PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY-RELATED POLICIES,

INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT OR OTHER FRAUD, WHILE SEEKING TO COLLECT AND USE PERSONAL INFORMATION IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WE ALSO HAVE UNDERTAKEN MEASURES TO ASSESS THE LEVEL

OF ACCESS TO CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE DATA BY OUR EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS.

FAIR CREDIT REPORTING

THE FCRA REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER COMPANIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, FCRA PLACES

RESTRICTIONS (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) ON THE SHARING AND USE OF CERTAIN PERSONAL FINANCIAL AND CREDITWORTHINESS INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WITH AND BY OUR AFFILIATES.

THE FCRA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED BY THE ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2003 OF THE FACT ACT. THE FACT ACT REQUIRES ANY COMPANY THAT RECEIVES INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN AFFILIATE, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO PERMIT THE CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM HAVING THAT INFORMATION USED TO MARKET THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. IN NOVEMBER 2007, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ISSUED A FINAL RULE IMPLEMENTING THE AFFILIATE MARKETING

PROVISIONS OF THE FACT ACT. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THESE AGENCIES WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE BY OCTOBER 1, 2008. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS MECHANISMS TO ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS TO OPT OUT OF AFFILIATE SHARING AND OF

MARKETING BY THE COMPANY AND OUR AFFILIATES, AND WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ENHANCE THESE MECHANISMS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS AND A FAVORABLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.

THE FACT ACT FURTHER AMENDED THE FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT OR DECREASE IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IMPROVE THE

ACCURACY OF CONSUMER CREDIT INFORMATION. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE IN NOVEMBER 2007 REQUIRING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM CONTAINING REASONABLE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS THE RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IDENTIFY ACCOUNTS WHERE IDENTITY THEFT IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ORIGINALLY WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE BY NOVEMBER 1,

2008, BUT THE FTC SUSPENDED ENFORCEMENT OF ITS RULE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010 PENDING CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION BY CONGRESS TO CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF ENTITIES COVERED BY THE LAW AND THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. ON DECEMBER 18, 2010, THE

PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW THE RED FLAG PROGRAM CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2010. OUR INTERNAL POLICIES AND STANDARDS, AS WELL AS OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE DATA PROTECTION, INFORMATION SECURITY AND FRAUD PREVENTION PROGRAMS, ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW

IDENTITY THEFT REQUIREMENTS.

THE FACT ACT ALSO IMPOSES DUTIES ON BOTH CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND ON BUSINESSES THAT

FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FURNISHER OF INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO PREVENT THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE RESULT OF IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO, IF A

CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, THE FURNISHER OF THAT INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A TIMELY FASHION. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS AND THE FTC HAVE

ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE DISPUTES REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE FACT ACT ALSO REQUIRES GRANTORS OF

CREDIT THAT USE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO OFFER A BORROWER CREDIT ON TERMS THAT ARE MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE TERMS OFFERED TO MOST OF THE LENDERS OTHER CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE

BORROWER THAT THE TERMS ARE BASED ON A CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. IN SUCH A CASE THE BORROWER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS AND THE FTC HAVE ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY THE

CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH RISK-BASED PRICING NOTICES MUST BE PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS AND THE CONTENT, FORMAT AND TIMING OF SUCH NOTICES. SINCE JULY 21, 2011, DODD-FRANK REQUIRES THE ADDITION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT SCORES

TO RISK-BASED PRICING NOTICES AND TO ADVERSE ACTION NOTICES OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY THE FCRA. GRANTORS OF CREDIT USING PRESCREENED CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN CREDIT SOLICITATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO INCLUDE AN ENHANCED NOTICE

TO CONSUMERS THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT FROM RECEIVING FURTHER PRESCREENED OFFERS OF CREDIT. THE ENACTMENT OF THE FACT ACT AND THE PROMULGATION OF RULES IMPLEMENTING IT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OR

PRACTICES.

THE CARD ACT

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE LEGISLATION KNOWN AS THE CARD ACT, WHICH WAS ENACTED IN MAY 2009. THE CARD ACT AND THE REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE CARD ACT REGULATE CREDIT CARD BILLING, PRICING,

DISCLOSURE AND OTHER PRACTICES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN ASPECTS OF GIFT CERTIFICATES, STORE GIFT CARDS AND GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS PRIMARILY FOR PERSONAL USE.

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WITH RESPECT TO BILLING AND PAYMENT, THE CARD ACT PROHIBITS A CARD ISSUER FROM TREATING ANY

PAYMENT AS LATE FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING IMPOSING A PENALTY INTEREST RATE OR LATE FEE, UNLESS THE ISSUER HAS ADOPTED REASONABLE PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT A PERIODIC STATEMENT SHOWING THE REQUIRED MINIMUM PAYMENT IS MAILED TO THE CONSUMER

AT LEAST 21 DAYS BEFORE THE PAYMENT DUE DATE. ISSUERS ARE REQUIRED TO APPLY PAYMENT AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE REQUIRED MINIMUM PAYMENT FIRST TO THE BALANCE WITH THE HIGHEST ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) AND THEN TO EACH SUCCESSIVE BALANCE

BEARING THE NEXT HIGHEST APR.

WITH RESPECT TO PRICING, THE CARD ACT PROHIBITS AN ISSUER FROM INCREASING ANY APR ON AN

OUTSTANDING BALANCE, EXCEPT IN SPECIFIC ENUMERATED CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS WHEN A PROMOTIONAL RATE EXPIRES, A VARIABLE RATE ADJUSTS, OR AN ACCOUNT IS 60 OR MORE DAYS DELINQUENT. AN ISSUER ALSO GENERALLY MAY NOT INCREASE AN APR APPLICABLE TO FUTURE

USES OF A CREDIT CARD, OR AN ANNUAL FEE, WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER ACCOUNT OPENING, AND THEN, IN EACH CASE, ONLY WITH ADVANCE NOTICE. IF AN ISSUER INCREASES AN APR, THE CARD ACT REQUIRES THAT THE ISSUER PERIODICALLY REEVALUATE THE APR INCREASE TO

DETERMINE IF A DECREASE IS APPROPRIATE.

WITH RESPECT TO DISCLOSURE, THE CARD ACT GENERALLY REQUIRES ISSUERS TO

PROVIDE CERTAIN REPAYMENT DISCLOSURES ON PERIODIC STATEMENTS, SUCH AS A DISCLOSURE OF THE TOTAL COST TO THE CONSUMER, INCLUDING INTEREST CHARGES, OF PAYING OFF A BALANCE BY MAKING ONLY THE REQUIRED MINIMUM PAYMENT EACH BILLING CYCLE. AN ISSUER IS

ALSO OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE 45 DAYS ADVANCE NOTICE PRIOR TO MAKING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF AN ACCOUNT (SUCH AS INCREASING AN APR OR A LATE FEE) AND, IN SOME CASES, GIVES THE CONSUMER THE RIGHT TO REJECT THE PROPOSED

CHANGE.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT CARD ACT PROVISIONS INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE AMOUNT OF EACH PENALTY FEE FOR A VIOLATION WITH

RESPECT TO THE ACCOUNT BE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL TO SUCH VIOLATION; THAT ISSUERS MUST NOT OPEN A CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT OR INCREASE A CREDIT LINE WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE CONSUMERS ABILITY TO MAKE THE REQUIRED MINIMUM PAYMENTS

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ACCOUNT; AND THAT ISSUERS MUST PERIODICALLY PROVIDE CARD ACCOUNT AGREEMENTS TO THE CFPB FOR POSTING ON ITS PUBLIC WEBSITE.

WITH RESPECT TO GIFT CERTIFICATES, STORE GIFT CARDS AND GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARDS PRIMARILY FOR PERSONAL USE, THE CARD ACT PERMITS THE IMPOSITION OF DORMANCY, INACTIVITY AND SERVICE FEES ONLY AFTER ONE

YEAR OF INACTIVITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE RULES PROHIBIT THE SALE OR ISSUANCE OF A GIFT CERTIFICATE, STORE GIFT CARD AND GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARD THAT HAS FUNDS WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE OF LESS THAN, WITH RESPECT TO A GIFT CERTIFICATE, FIVE YEARS AFTER

THE DATE THE CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED AND, WITH RESPECT TO A STORE GIFT CARD OR GENERAL-USE PREPAID CARD, FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH FUNDS WERE LAST LOADED. THE RULES ALSO REQUIRE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO GIVE

CONSUMERS A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE A CERTIFICATE OR CARD WITH AT LEAST FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE APPLICABLE EXPIRATION DATE. THE RULES PROHIBIT FEES FOR REPLACING AN EXPIRED CERTIFICATE OR CARD OR REFUNDING THE REMAINING BALANCE IF THE

UNDERLYING FUNDS REMAIN VALID (EXCEPT FOR LOST OR STOLEN CARDS). THE CARD ACT ALSO REQUIRES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES REGARDING ANY FEE OTHER THAN A DORMANCY, INACTIVITY OR SERVICE FEE.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE

AMERICAN

EXPRESS IS SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS AS A RESULT OF BEING A FINANCIAL COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS HAVING A GLOBAL PRESENCE. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE MAJORITY OF AML REQUIREMENTS IS

DERIVED FROM THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS IT HAS BEEN AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT. IN EUROPE, AML REQUIREMENTS ARE LARGELY THE RESULT OF COUNTRIES TRANSPOSING THE 3

RD

EUROPEAN UNION MONEY LAUNDERING DIRECTIVE (AND PRECEDING EU MONEY LAUNDERING DIRECTIVES) INTO LOCAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. WE ANTICIPATE THE PASSAGE OF THE 4

TH

EUROPEAN

MONEY LAUNDERING DIRECTIVE IN 2014, WHICH MAY ADD NEW AML REQUIREMENTS. NUMEROUS OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND MEXICO, HAVE ALSO ENACTED OR PROPOSED NEW OR ENHANCED AML LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO AMERICAN

EXPRESS.

THE UNDERPINNINGS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE THE EFFORTS OF EACH GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

FROM BEING USED BY CRIMINALS TO HIDE THEIR ILLICIT PROCEEDS AND TO IMPEDE TERRORISTS ABILITY TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH AML PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, EXPANDED REPORTING, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS, AND ENHANCED

INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS. ANY ERRORS, FAILURES OR DELAYS IN COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL, STATE OR FOREIGN AML AND COUNTER-TERRORIST FINANCING LAWS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWSUITS, PENALTIES AND

FORFEITURE OF SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A

GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY, DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT, AT A MINIMUM, AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ALL OF ITS BUSINESSES ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO AML AND ANTI-TERRORIST FINANCING INITIATIVES. THE

AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY REQUIRES THAT EACH AMERICAN EXPRESS BUSINESS MAINTAINS A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FOR A SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS TO ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE DUE DILIGENCE AND, WHEN NECESSARY, ENHANCED

DUE DILIGENCE, INCLUDING OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION, IS CONDUCTED AT ACCOUNT OPENING AND UPDATED, AS NECESSARY, THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP. THE GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY IS ALSO DESIGNED TO

ENSURE THERE ARE APPROPRIATE METHODS OF MONITORING TRANSACTIONS AND ACCOUNT RELATIONSHIPS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY AND REPORTING SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND

REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY REQUIRES THE TRAINING OF APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL WITH REGARD TO AML AND ANTI-TERRORIST FINANCING ISSUES AND PROVIDES FOR INDEPENDENT TESTING TO ENSURE THAT THE GLOBAL

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATION

THE UNITED STATES HAS IMPOSED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THAT AFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH DESIGNATED FOREIGN COUNTRIES, NATIONALS AND

OTHERS. THE UNITED STATES PROHIBITS U.S. PERSONS FROM ENGAGING WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES IDENTIFIED AS SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS, SUCH AS TERRORISTS AND NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. THESE PROHIBITIONS ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURYS OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC) AND ARE TYPICALLY KNOWN AS THE OFAC RULES. THE OFAC RULES PROHIBIT U.S. PERSONS FROM ENGAGING IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH OR RELATING TO THE PROHIBITED

INDIVIDUAL, ENTITY OR COUNTRY, REQUIRE THE BLOCKING OF ASSETS IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL, ENTITY OR COUNTRY HAS AN INTEREST, AND PROHIBIT TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY SUBJECT TO U.S. JURISDICTION (INCLUDING PROPERTY IN THE POSSESSION OR CONTROL OF U.S.

PERSONS) TO SUCH INDIVIDUAL, ENTITY OR COUNTRY. BLOCKED ASSETS (E.G., PROPERTY OR BANK DEPOSITS) CANNOT BE PAID OUT, WITHDRAWN, SET OFF OR TRANSFERRED IN ANY MANNER WITHOUT A LICENSE FROM OFAC. WE MAINTAIN A GLOBAL SANCTIONS PROGRAM DESIGNED TO

ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH OFAC REQUIREMENTS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS COULD SUBJECT US TO SERIOUS LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT OF 2012, WHICH ADDED SECTION 13(R) TO THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT), AN ISSUER IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE IN ITS ANNUAL OR QUARTERLY REPORTS, AS APPLICABLE, WHETHER IT OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES KNOWINGLY ENGAGED IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES,

TRANSACTIONS OR DEALINGS RELATING TO IRAN OR WITH INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES DESIGNATED PURSUANT TO CERTAIN EXECUTIVE ORDERS. DISCLOSURE IS GENERALLY REQUIRED EVEN WHERE THE ACTIVITIES, TRANSACTIONS OR DEALINGS WERE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

SINCE 2011, AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL BOOKED APPROXIMATELY 363 FLIGHTS ON IRAN AIR AND 2 FLIGHTS ON MAHAN AIR FOR

PASSENGERS. WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $5,900 IN GROSS REVENUES AND NEGLIGIBLE NET PROFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE TRANSACTIONS. ALTHOUGH THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FROM U.S. SANCTIONS FOR TRAVEL-RELATED TRANSACTIONS

UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ACT, AS AMENDED, WE DO NOT INTEND TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THIS ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, A TRAVEL COMPANY THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED AN AFFILIATE OF OURS, AMERICAN EXPRESS NIPPON TRAVEL AGENCY, INC.

COMPENSATION PRACTICES

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IN JUNE 2010, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC, THE FDIC AND THE OTS JOINTLY ISSUED FINAL GUIDANCE ON SOUND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

POLICIES THAT APPLIES TO ALL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS ALL INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. THE FINAL GUIDANCE SETS

FORTH THREE KEY PRINCIPLES FOR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE THAT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS DO NOT ENCOURAGE EXCESSIVE RISK-TAKING AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF BANKING ORGANIZATIONS.

THE THREE PRINCIPLES PROVIDE THAT A BANKING ORGANIZATIONS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD (1) PROVIDE INCENTIVES THAT APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO EXPOSE

THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPRUDENT RISKS, (2) BE COMPATIBLE WITH EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT, AND (3) BE SUPPORTED BY STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, INCLUDING ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT BY THE ORGANIZATIONS BOARD

OF DIRECTORS. ANY DEFICIENCIES IN COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF A BANKING INSTITUTION THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE OR OTHER BANKING REGULATORS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS REVIEW OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS COMPENSATION PRACTICES MAY BE

INCORPORATED INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISORY RATINGS, WHICH CAN AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR PERFORM OTHER ACTIONS. THE FINAL GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST A BANKING ORGANIZATION IF ITS

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATED RISK-MANAGEMENT CONTROL OR GOVERNANCE PROCESSES POSE A RISK TO THE ORGANIZATIONS SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS AND THE ORGANIZATION IS NOT TAKING PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO CORRECT THE DEFICIENCIES.

ADDITIONALLY, IN 2011, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OCC, THE FDIC, THE OTS, THE SEC, THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY AND THE

NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION ISSUED PROPOSED RULEMAKING PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK ON INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION PRACTICES. UNDER THE PROPOSED RULE, ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF $1 BILLION OR MORE (SUCH AS

THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB) WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM OFFERING INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT ENCOURAGE INAPPROPRIATE RISK TAKING BY OFFERING EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION OR COMPENSATION THAT COULD LEAD THE COMPANY

TO MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS. ALL COVERED INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FEDERAL REGULATORS WITH ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROPOSED RULE AND ALSO TO MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.

ADDITIONALLY, FOR COVERED INSTITUTIONS WITH AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, SUCH AS THE COMPANY, THE PROPOSED RULE REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION BE DEFERRED

FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS AND PROVIDES FOR THE ADJUSTMENT OF DEFERRED PAYMENTS TO REFLECT ACTUAL LOSSES OR OTHER MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE THAT BECOME KNOWN DURING THE DEFERRAL PERIOD. MOREOVER, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF A COVERED INSTITUTION WITH

AT LEAST $50 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS MUST IDENTIFY EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE AUTHORITY TO EXPOSE AN INSTITUTION TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK, EVALUATE AND DOCUMENT THE INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION METHODS USED TO BALANCE RISK AND FINANCIAL REWARDS

FOR THE IDENTIFIED EMPLOYEES, AND APPROVE INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES AFTER APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERING OTHER AVAILABLE METHODS FOR BALANCING RISK AND FINANCIAL REWARDS. THE FORM AND TIMING OF ANY FINAL RULE CANNOT BE

DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.

THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THESE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARE CONTINUING TO

DEVELOP AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE EVOLVING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME WHETHER COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH POLICIES AND REGULATIONS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO HIRE, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY EMPLOYEES.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT

(THE FCPA), THE U.K. BRIBERY ACT AND OTHER LAWS THAT PROHIBIT THE MAKING OR OFFERING OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS. THE FCPA MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO CORRUPTLY OFFER OR PROVIDE ANYTHING OF VALUE TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, POLITICAL PARTIES OR

POLITICAL PARTY OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING BUSINESS OR AN IMPROPER ADVANTAGE. THE ANTI-BRIBERY PROVISIONS OF THE FCPA ARE ENFORCED BY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ). THE FCPA ALSO REQUIRES US TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH

CERTAIN ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STANDARDS, WHICH ARE ENFORCED BY THE SEC. IN RECENT YEARS, DOJ AND SEC ENFORCEMENT OF THE FCPA HAS BECOME MORE INTENSE. THE U.K. BRIBERY ACT, WHICH TOOK EFFECT IN JULY 2011, ALSO PROHIBITS

COMMERCIAL BRIBERY, AND THE RECEIPT OF A BRIBE, AND MAKES IT A CORPORATE OFFENSE TO FAIL TO PREVENT BRIBERY BY AN ASSOCIATED PERSON, IN ADDITION TO PROHIBITING IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE FCPA, THE

U.K. BRIBERY ACT AND OTHER LAWS CAN EXPOSE US AND/OR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES TO POTENTIALLY SEVERE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES. THE RISK MAY BE GREATER WHEN WE TRANSACT BUSINESS, WHETHER THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES OR JOINT VENTURES OR OTHER PARTNERSHIPS, IN

COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER PERCEIVED LEVELS OF CORRUPTION. WE HAVE RISK-BASED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO DETECT AND DETER PROHIBITED PRACTICES, PROVIDE SPECIALIZED TRAINING, MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS AND PAYMENTS, AND INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF

IMPROPRIETIES RELATING TO TRANSACTIONS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED. HOWEVER, IF OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS GOVERNING OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL

EMPLOYEES, MAY FACE INVESTIGATIONS OR PROSECUTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS, TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SEE NOTE 25 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON PAGES 102-104 OF OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.) OUR REVENUES CAN BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE

AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARD MEMBERS SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY CARD MEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN

THEIR LOCAL CURRENCY, AND FOR THE REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES). SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARD MEMBERS CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF THE CARD IN

CONNECTION WITH SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE POSSIBILITY

THAT, BECAUSE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR MAY BE REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESS THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECORDED

IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE PURCHASE BY CARD MEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A

TRAVELERS CHEQUE DENOMINATED IN A SECOND CURRENCY; AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS, UNLESS PROPERLY MONITORED AND MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOW WE MANAGE

RISK RELATING TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SEE RISK MANAGEMENT  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS ON PAGES 45-46 OF OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

(A)

THE INCREASE IN NON-PERFORMING LOANS BETWEEN 2009 AND 2010 WAS DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RELATED TO TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND CONSOLIDATION OF

VIES, WHICH RESULTED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE LENDING TRUST BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010. AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES, AMOUNTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES FOR BOTH THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS ISSUANCE TRUST (THE CHARGE TRUST) AND THE LENDING TRUST; CORRESPONDINGLY, 2009 AMOUNTS ONLY INCLUDE IMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES FOR THE CHARGE TRUST AND THE SELLERS INTEREST PORTION OF THE LENDING TRUST.

(B)

THE COMPANYS POLICY IS GENERALLY TO CEASE ACCRUING INTEREST INCOME ONCE A RELATED CARD MEMBER LOAN IS 180 DAYS PAST DUE AT WHICH TIME THE CARD MEMBER LOAN IS

WRITTEN OFF. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES LOAN LOSS RESERVES FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE INTEREST RECEIVABLE BALANCES PRIOR TO WRITE-OFF. FOR THE U.S., AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THESE AMOUNTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN CARD MEMBER LOANS PLACED WITH

OUTSIDE COLLECTION AGENCIES.

(C)

REPRESENTS MODIFICATION PROGRAMS CLASSIFIED AS TDRS, WHEREIN THE TERMS OF A LOAN OR RECEIVABLE HAVE BEEN MODIFIED FOR CARD MEMBERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES AND A CONCESSION HAS BEEN GRANTED TO THE BORROWER. SUCH MODIFICATIONS TO THE LOANS AND RECEIVABLES PRIMARILY INCLUDE (I) TEMPORARY INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS (POSSIBLY AS LOW AS ZERO PERCENT, IN WHICH CASE THE LOAN IS CHARACTERIZED

AS NON-ACCRUAL IN THE COMPANYS TDR DISCLOSURES), (II) PLACING THE CARD MEMBER ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN NOT TO EXCEED 60 MONTHS AND (III) SUSPENDING DELINQUENCY FEES UNTIL THE CARD MEMBER EXITS THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM. UPON ENTERING

THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM, THE CARD MEMBERS ABILITY TO MAKE FUTURE PURCHASES IS EITHER CANCELLED OR IN CERTAIN CASES SUSPENDED UNTIL THE CARD MEMBER SUCCESSFULLY EXITS THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MODIFICATION AGREEMENT WITH

THE CARD MEMBER, LOANS REVERT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS (INCLUDING THE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATE) WHEN THE CARD MEMBER EXITS THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM, WHICH IS EITHER (I) WHEN ALL PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

MODIFICATION AGREEMENT OR (II) WHEN THE CARD MEMBER DEFAULTS OUT OF THE MODIFICATION PROGRAM.

THIS DISCLOSURE PRESENTS OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS AS WELL AS SPECIFIC RESERVES FOR CERTAIN RECEIVABLES WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT POSSIBLE CREDIT PROBLEMS OF BORROWERS CAUSES MANAGEMENT TO HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS AS

TO THE ABILITY OF SUCH BORROWERS TO COMPLY WITH THE PRESENT REPAYMENT TERMS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE COMPANY DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEM LOANS OR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THE CARD MEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO THAT WERE NOT

ALREADY INCLUDED IN RISK ELEMENTS ABOVE.

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS (FFIEC) GUIDELINES

GOVERNING THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE FFIEC GUIDELINES FOR ITS CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE STARTING WITH 2009 REPORTING. FFIEC GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN REVISED EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2013, ACCORDINGLY THIS

DISCLOSURE HAS BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM WITH THE REVISED GUIDELINES.

THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND GUIDE 3

GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE ARE: I) THE FFIEC METHODOLOGY INCLUDES MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURES OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS WHICH ARE EXCLUDED UNDER GUIDE 3; AND II) INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE INCLUDED UNDER FFIEC BUT

EXCLUDED UNDER GUIDE 3.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS FROM BORROWERS OR

COUNTERPARTIES FOR EACH FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT EXCEED 1 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS FOR ANY OF THE PERIODS REPORTED BELOW. CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS INCLUDE LOANS, RECEIVABLES, INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS WITH OTHER BANKS, OTHER

INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS AND OTHER MONETARY ASSETS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN EITHER DOLLARS OR OTHER NON-LOCAL CURRENCY.

RISK FACTORS

THIS

SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR

COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR

SECURITIES.

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS

DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, BOTH IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. UNCERTAIN EXPECTATIONS FOR AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAVE HAD, AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE VERY DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR. A PROLONGED PERIOD OF SLOW

ECONOMIC GROWTH OR DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD CHANGE CUSTOMER BEHAVIORS FURTHER. IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WERE TO PERSIST OR WORSEN, WE COULD EXPERIENCE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING, BUSINESS INVESTMENT, GOVERNMENT SPENDING, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES, FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, THE

VOLATILITY AND STRENGTH OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INFLATION ALL AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, OUR PROFITABILITY. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER FAMILY INCOME, LOWER CORPORATE

EARNINGS, LOWER BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING IS LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, SUCH FACTORS MAY CAUSE OUR EARNINGS, CREDIT METRICS AND MARGINS TO

FLUCTUATE AND DIVERGE FROM EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, WHO MAY HAVE DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THEIR IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, AND MAY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES.

POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING AND OUR LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG

OTHER BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL

DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

WE HELD APPROXIMATELY $4.0 BILLION OF

INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. IN THE EVENT THAT ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES OF THESE INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE FROM HISTORICAL PATTERNS DUE TO CHALLENGES IN THE ECONOMY OR

OTHERWISE, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN IN

COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS OR HAVE OPERATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL.

THE

GLOBAL MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS, WHILE DEMONSTRATING GENERALLY IMPROVED CONDITIONS, REMAIN SUSCEPTIBLE TO VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS.

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE NEED LIQUIDITY TO PAY MERCHANTS, OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST ON DEBT AND DIVIDENDS ON

CAPITAL STOCK AND TO REPAY MATURING LIABILITIES. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WE COULD BE FORCED TO LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY ARE PAYMENTS FROM CARD MEMBERS AND

MERCHANTS, CASH FLOW FROM OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ASSETS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF CASH OR ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH, DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY SOURCED DEPOSITS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES AND

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, SECURITIZED BORROWINGS THROUGH OUR SECURED FINANCING FACILITIES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW AND LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITIES.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON INVESTOR DEMAND. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION, WE ARE NOT

IMMUNE FROM PRESSURES EXPERIENCED BROADLY ACROSS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE FRAGILITY OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HAVE IMPACTED FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. ALTHOUGH MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS HAVE IMPROVED, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH MARKETS WILL BE OPEN TO US IN THE FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, CONCERNS REGARDING U.S. DEBT AND BUDGET MATTERS AND SOVEREIGN DEBT AND RELATED AUSTERITY MEASURES IN EUROPE HAVE CAUSED

UNCERTAINTY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE IMPACT OF THE POTENTIAL END TO THE FEDERAL RESERVES QUANTITATIVE EASING POLICY COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS GENERALLY.

IN THE EVENT THAT CURRENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING INTERNAL SOURCES, DO NOT SATISFY OUR NEEDS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SEEK

ADDITIONAL FINANCING. THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET CONDITIONS, THE GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND CONSUMER DEPOSITS, THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, NEW REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS, OUR CREDIT RATINGS (WHICH WERE DOWNGRADED IN APRIL 2009 BY TWO OF THE MAJOR RATINGS AGENCIES) AND CREDIT CAPACITY, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LENDERS OR DEPOSITORS COULD DEVELOP A NEGATIVE

PERCEPTION OF OUR LONG- OR SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL PROSPECTS IF WE INCUR LARGE CREDIT LOSSES OR IF THE LEVEL OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY DECREASES DUE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. SEE

AN INABILITY TO ACCEPT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND

OR REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS

BELOW.

WHILE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS SINCE THE LATTER HALF OF 2009, IF THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND LENDING PORTFOLIOS WERE TO WEAKEN THROUGH INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND WRITE-OFFS, OUR

LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR COST OF CAPITAL COULD INCREASE. DISRUPTIONS, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY ALSO

LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE, IN A TIMELY MANNER, MATURING LIABILITIES, SATISFY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO GROW OUR

BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY RAISING CAPITAL OR BEAR AN UNATTRACTIVE COST TO RAISE CAPITAL, WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. MARKET DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT, WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL, ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEW  FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 38-40 OF OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS,

WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

WE CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ROUTINE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL

SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL

SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. DEFAULTS OR NON-PERFORMANCE BY, OR EVEN RUMORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT, ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS, OR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY,

HAVE LED TO MARKET-WIDE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND COULD LEAD TO LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY ONE OR MORE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

79

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANY REDUCTION IN OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE THE COST OF OUR FUNDING

FROM, AND RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO, THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ALTHOUGH OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM DEBT IS CURRENTLY RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES, THE RATINGS OF THAT DEBT WERE DOWNGRADED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 BY

MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES (MOODYS) AND STANDARD & POORS (S&P), TWO OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. THE RATING AGENCIES REGULARLY EVALUATE US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR RATINGS OF OUR AND OUR

SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS FACTORS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, AND THE

WIDER STATE OF THE ECONOMY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES WILL MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT RESPECTIVE RATINGS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THOSE RATINGS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER TERMS UPON WHICH WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN FUNDING.

WE CANNOT PREDICT

WHAT ACTIONS RATING AGENCIES MAY TAKE. AS WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BY ANY OF THE RATING AGENCIES.

ADVERSE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD DECREASE EARNINGS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND IMPACT OUR

CAPITAL.

DURING 2013, APPROXIMATELY 28 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WERE GENERATED FROM

ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE VALUES

OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF

OTHER CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE REVENUES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR NET REVENUES OF $33.0 BILLION BY APPROXIMATELY $0.3 BILLION.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS

ONGOING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING OUR

NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS PROVISIONS IN MERCHANT CONTRACTS COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO THOSE PROVISIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL LOSS OF REVENUE OR INCREASED EXPENSES, SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY JUDGMENTS AND/OR DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL

REPUTATION AND BRAND.

THE DOJ AND CERTAIN STATES ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST US ALLEGING

THAT THE PROVISIONS IN OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST OUR CARD PRODUCTS AT THE POINT OF SALE VIOLATE THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH WERE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN

THE DOJ AND STATE ACTION, ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AND HAVE BEEN DISMISSED AS PARTIES PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE COURT. THE SETTLEMENT ENJOINS VISA AND MASTERCARD FROM ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM

ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO STEER CARDHOLDERS TO OTHER CARD PRODUCTS OR PAYMENT FORMS AT THE POINT OF SALE. IN ADDITION, WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSED CLASS ACTIONS FILED BY MERCHANTS THAT CHALLENGE THE

NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARDS PROVISIONS IN OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS. IN DECEMBER 2013, WE AGREED TO SETTLE THESE MERCHANT CLASS ACTIONS AND THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN PRELIMINARILY APPROVED BY THE COURT. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE COURT WILL GRANT FINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH CAN BE IMPACTED BY OBJECTIONS TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BY PLAINTIFFS AND OTHER PARTIES, AS WELL AS BY THE APPEALS PROCESS. A DESCRIPTION OF THESE LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IS CONTAINED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

80

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN THESE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST US COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

PROFITABILITY, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR MERCHANT AGREEMENTS IN A WAY THAT COULD EXPOSE OUR CARD PRODUCTS TO INCREASED STEERING, SELECTIVE ACCEPTANCE OR OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AT THE POINT OF SALE THAT WOULD IMPAIR OUR CARD MEMBERS

EXPERIENCE, COULD IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES AND/OR COULD DAMAGE OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND. EVEN IF WE WERE NOT REQUIRED TO CHANGE OUR MERCHANT AGREEMENTS, CHANGES IN VISAS AND MASTERCARDS POLICIES OR PRACTICES AS A RESULT

OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, LAWSUIT SETTLEMENTS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY.

THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DODD-FRANK, AS WELL AS REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER, MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY, FOR EXAMPLE, REQUIRING US TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, REQUIRING US TO COMPLY WITH MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENTS, LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES,

IMPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US (INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INCREASED COSTS OF FUNDING RAISED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES), LIMITING THE FEES WE CAN CHARGE FOR SERVICES, IMPACTING THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, AND

INCREASING OUR COLLATERAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS ON INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS WE ENTER. A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IS CONTAINED IN SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

ABOVE. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE THE COMPANY AND TRS ARE LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  HEIGHTENED PRUDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR

LARGE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

DODD-FRANK HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED

SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CFPB. THE CFPB HAS BROAD RULEMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS AND PAYMENT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND

AUTHORITY TO PREVENT UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES. THE CFPB HAS THE AUTHORITY TO WRITE REGULATIONS UNDER FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAWS, AND TO ENFORCE THOSE LAWS AGAINST AND EXAMINE FOR COMPLIANCE LARGE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB. IT IS ALSO AUTHORIZED TO COLLECT FINES AND REQUIRE CONSUMER RESTITUTION IN THE EVENT OF VIOLATIONS, ENGAGE IN CONSUMER FINANCIAL EDUCATION, TRACK CONSUMER COMPLAINTS, REQUEST

DATA AND PROMOTE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED CONSUMERS AND COMMUNITIES. OUR COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REGULATIONS IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS TO THE COMPANY AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ATTENTION FROM THE COMPANYS

SENIOR MANAGEMENT. LIKEWISE, ANY FAILURE TO FOLLOW SUCH REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN RESTITUTION TO CARD MEMBERS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS, INCLUDING CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS, CFPB OVERSIGHT HAS RESULTED, AND IS

LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT, IN CHANGES TO PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES AND MAY POTENTIALLY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO MARKETPLACE CHANGES. SUCH CHANGES COULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE TO CONSUMERS AND IMPAIR OUR

ABILITY TO OFFER THEM PROFITABLY. SUCH CHANGES COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BRAND AND REPUTATION. SEE 

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR

REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES

 BELOW.

MANY PROVISIONS OF DODD-FRANK, INCLUDING NUMEROUS PROVISIONS

NOT DESCRIBED ABOVE, REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF RULES TO IMPLEMENT. IN ADDITION, DODD-FRANK MANDATES MULTIPLE STUDIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION. THEREFORE, THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF DODD-FRANK AND ITS

IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REMAIN UNCERTAIN.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO

SIGNIFICANT AND EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BECAME BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A RESULT OF

BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIMITATION, CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL REGULATION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TWO U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR NON-BANKING ACTIVITIES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVES REGULATIONS.

BANKING REGULATIONS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROTECT DEPOSITORS FUNDS, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS AND THE BANKING SYSTEM AS A

WHOLE, AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS OR CREDITORS. IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND WE MAY BE RESTRICTED IN OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CERTAIN CAPITAL ACTIONS (SUCH AS DECLARING DIVIDENDS OR REPURCHASING OUTSTANDING SHARES) OR ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR ACQUISITIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, OUR BANKING REGULATORS HAVE WIDE DISCRETION IN THE EXAMINATION AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE BANKING STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, AND MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OR ACQUISITIONS, OR MAY REQUIRE US TO

MAINTAIN MORE CAPITAL.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE

WORLD, BOTH AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND OTHERWISE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS A RESULT OF REGULATORS ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE COULD BE FINED, REQUIRED TO PAY RESTITUTION, PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN SOME OF

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, SUBJECTED TO LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS ON OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OR SUBJECTED TO NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER TAXES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OR WITH RESPECT TO OUR

EMPLOYEES. REGULATORY ACTION COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND BRAND AND ANY CHANGE TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT MAKES OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE TO OUR CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THERE IS ALSO THE RISK THAT NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE IMPOSED, WHICH COULD IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REQUIRE US TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES OR ALTER OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, AFFECT RETENTION OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, OR EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS

(INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS). SUCH CHANGES ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2009 REQUIRED US TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO MANY OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING MARKETING, UNDERWRITING, PRICING AND BILLING. WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO CARD PRODUCT

TERMS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH, AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY, THE CARD ACT; HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH CHANGES WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN THE EVENT THE CARD ACT CONSTRAINS OUR ABILITY

TO RESPOND TO ECONOMIC, MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR REVENUE AND NET INCOME.

IN ADDITION TO PROPOSED LEGISLATION AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY OTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTION OR INACTION, INCLUDING THE FAILURE OF THE

U.S. CONGRESS TO RENEW THE ACTIVE FINANCING EXCEPTION TO SUBPART F OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR NET INCOME.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT, AND IN SOME CASES, LESS STRINGENT, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REGIMES. THE MORE

RESTRICTIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US CAN PUT US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE AND NON-U.S. COMPETITORS, INCLUDING PROHIBITING US FROM ENGAGING

IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, MAKING THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MORE EXPENSIVE OR ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR COST STRUCTURE.

SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT.

82

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS AND/OR

REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES.

BUSINESSES IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN SUBJECT TO

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF COMPETITION/ANTITRUST LAW, CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AMONG OTHERS. MANY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATORY OR

PUNITIVE DAMAGES. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY ACTIONS AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN SUCH ACTIONS, INCLUDING SUBPOENAS, INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS, IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE OR ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR

REGULATIONS. THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF ADDITIONAL REGULATION, ENHANCED COMPLIANCE EFFORTS AND INCREASED REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT IN CHANGES TO PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES, INCREASED COSTS

RELATED TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION AND ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION TO CARD MEMBERS. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS GENERALLY COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, INCREASED EXPENSES, RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ACTIVITIES AND DAMAGE

TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES, AND IF WE FAIL TO MEET THESE RULES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

UNDER REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MUST MEET RULES FOR CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND LEVERAGE

RATIOS THAT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS. FAILURE BY ANY OF THE COMPANY, TRS OR A U.S.

SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION TO MAINTAIN ITS RESPECTIVE STATUS AS WELL CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED, IF UN-REMEDIED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, COULD COMPROMISE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS

IMPOSED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PAY COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK OR INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS.

THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY AND TRS AS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERNATIONAL BASEL III

FRAMEWORK AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING PHASED-IN. ONCE THESE REVISIONS ARE FULLY PHASED-IN, THE COMPANY, TRS AND OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY MORE STRINGENT CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS THAN IN THE PAST. WE ESTIMATE

THAT, HAD BASEL III BEEN FULLY PHASED-IN DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANYS CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER THE U.S. BASEL CAPITAL III RULES WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THIS ESTIMATE COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. AS

PART OF OUR REQUIRED STRESS TESTING, BOTH INTERNALLY AND BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL STANDARDS IN THE ADVERSE AND SEVERELY ADVERSE ECONOMIC SCENARIOS PUBLISHED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE EACH YEAR. TO

SATISFY THESE REQUIREMENTS, IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR US TO HOLD ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THAT REQUIRED BY THE NEW CAPITAL RULES AS THEY ARE PHASED-IN.

IN ADDITION TO THE NEW CAPITAL RULES, THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS OR POTENTIAL PROPOSALS THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE COMPANY AND OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED A FRAMEWORK FOR D-SIBS THAT WOULD IMPOSE A CAPITAL BUFFER ON CERTAIN BANKS THAT HAVE AN IMPORTANT

IMPACT ON THEIR DOMESTIC ECONOMIES. WHILE THE NEW CAPITAL RULES DID NOT ADDRESS THE ADOPTION OF A SURCHARGE ON D-SIBS, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS NOTED THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING A CAPITAL SURCHARGE FOR INSTITUTIONS WITH $50 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, OR SOME SUBSET OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS, CONSISTENT WITH THE BASEL COMMITTEES SURCHARGE PROPOSALS. IN ADDITION, THE BASEL COMMITTEE HAS REVISED THE EXPOSURE CALCULATION METHODOLOGY FOR THE BASEL III LEVERAGE RATIO (KNOWN IN

THE UNITED STATES AS THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO) THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS, WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE DENOMINATOR OF THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO  PRIMARILY WITH REGARD TO EXPOSURES FOR

DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS  AND COULD FURTHER INCREASE THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO US AND OUR U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, THERE CONTINUES TO BE SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS

OF THE CAPITAL REGIME THAT WILL APPLY TO US AND OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, AND, AS A RESULT, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT THESE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE ON OUR LONG-TERM CAPITAL PLANNING AND THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS.

83

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE WE EXPECT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW CAPITAL RULES, INCLUSIVE OF THE CAPITAL

CONSERVATION BUFFER, AS PHASED-IN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO LEND, GROW DEPOSIT BALANCES, MAKE ACQUISITIONS AND MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE FORM OF INCREASED DIVIDENDS OR SHARE

REPURCHASES. HIGHER CAPITAL LEVELS COULD ALSO LOWER OUR RETURN ON EQUITY. FAILURE TO MEET CURRENT OR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE IMPOSED BY THE NEW CAPITAL RULES OR BY REGULATORS IN IMPLEMENTING OTHER PORTIONS OF THE BASEL III

FRAMEWORK, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

COMPLIANCE WITH CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES, INCLUDING THE

NEW CAPITAL RULES, WILL REQUIRE A MATERIAL INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF RISK WEIGHT CALCULATIONS UNDER THE BASEL III STANDARDIZED APPROACH, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES WILL BE CORRECT AND WE MAY

NEED TO HOLD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REGULATORY CAPITAL THAN WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A GIVEN CAPITAL RATIO. AN INABILITY TO MEET REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS REGARDING OUR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL ADEQUACY RULES MAY ALSO

NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY, TRS AND ITS U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES BY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS.

FOR

MORE INFORMATION ON CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS, SEE FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL ADEQUACY UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR CAPITAL STOCK. OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS

TO US, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY.

WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE CAPITAL

STOCK BY OUR REGULATORS WHO HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT ANY ACTION THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY PAY DIVIDENDS

ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF EARNINGS, AND ONLY IF PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT CAPITAL PLANS

THAT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROJECTED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OF CAPITAL STOCK, TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR REVIEW. AS PART OF THE CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS, OUR PROPOSED CAPITAL ACTIONS ARE ASSESSED AGAINST OUR

ABILITY TO SATISFY APPLICABLE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE BASEL III CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE NEW CAPITAL RULES. IF OUR CAPITAL PLAN IS NOT APPROVED FOR ANY REASON OR IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY APPLICABLE CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, OUR ABILITY TO UNDERTAKE CAPITAL ACTIONS MAY BE RESTRICTED.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY RELIES ON DIVIDENDS FROM

ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR LIQUIDITY, AND FEDERAL AND STATE LAW LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY PAY TO THE PARENT COMPANY. IN PARTICULAR, OUR U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS STATUTORY AND REGULATORY

LIMITATIONS ON THEIR DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY COULD BE REDUCED TO THE EXTENT OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE UNABLE TO DECLARE AND PAY DIVIDENDS TO THE COMPANY WHEN NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS,

AND THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON ITS OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK, MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OR MAKE OTHER PAYMENTS ON ITS OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS.

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL

REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE BURDENS AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND REVENUES THROUGH OUR NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING AND CARD

ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS A PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF THE

PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS EVOLVED AND INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE AML PROGRAMS. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN

THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES OF CUSTOMERS AND MERCHANTS

WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS. IN ADDITION, MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES THAT PUT IN PLACE A COMMON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LICENSING

AND SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. THE DIRECTIVE IS NOW UNDERGOING REVIEW AND FURTHER CHANGES, AS YET TO BE DEFINED, ARE ANTICIPATED. COMPLYING WITH THESE

AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCREASES OUR COSTS AND CAN REDUCE OUR REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES.

LEGISLATURES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COVERING IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, CREDIT BUREAU REPORTING, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY

OF OUR UNDERWRITING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT STANDARDS. THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES,

NEW REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR CREDIT CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED-VALUE CARDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE

OUR REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD ARE AWARE OF EACH OTHERS APPROACHES TO THE

REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. CONSEQUENTLY, A DEVELOPMENT IN ONE COUNTRY, STATE OR REGION MAY INFLUENCE REGULATORY APPROACHES IN ANOTHER. IN RECENT YEARS, SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE

OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS IN FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS SUCH AS VISA AND MASTERCARD AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS, AS WELL AS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANT

ACCEPTANCE CONTRACTS AND RULES. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (E.G., POLAND, HUNGARY) HAVE ENACTED LOCAL REGULATION ON INTERCHANGE FEES. IN MEXICO, THE GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY PASSED PAYMENT NETWORK LAWS THAT GIVE THE CENTRAL

BANK AND NATIONAL BANKING COMMISSION, ACTING TOGETHER, THE POWER TO ISSUE RULES ABOUT PAYMENT SYSTEMS INCLUDING INTERCHANGE AND OTHER FEES THAT, WHEN PROMULGATED, MAY IMPACT OUR CARD BUSINESSES IN THAT COUNTRY. REGULATORS IN AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL,

CANADA, HUNGARY, ITALY, MEXICO, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND, SWITZERLAND, THE UNITED KINGDOM, VENEZUELA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS INTO, OR INITIATED PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO, INTERCHANGE FEES THAT ARE ONGOING,

CONCLUDED OR ON APPEAL. IN SOME CASES THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE LED TO CHANGES IN NETWORK PRACTICES, SUCH AS NON-DISCRIMINATION AND HONOR-ALL-CARD PROVISIONS.

THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT

SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE SUCH INTERCHANGE FEES. FOR THIS REASON, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE THE DOMINANT

CARD NETWORKS, THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON THESE NETWORKS. HOWEVER, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION RELATING TO MERCHANT PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. AMONG OTHER IMPACTS, LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR

MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

DODD-FRANK PROHIBITS PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FROM RESTRICTING MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING

DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO PAY WITH PARTICULAR FORMS OF PAYMENT SUCH AS CASH, CHECK, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARDS, SO LONG AS OFFERS TO ENCOURAGE CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD PAYMENTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF THE NETWORK OR

ISSUER. FURTHER, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR APPLICABLE STATE LAW, THE DISCOUNT OR INCENTIVE MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AND MUST BE CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSED. DODD-FRANK ALSO PERMITS U.S. MERCHANTS TO

ESTABLISH MINIMUM PURCHASE AMOUNTS OF NO MORE THAN $10 FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, PROVIDED THAT THE MERCHANTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE ALSO PERMITTED TO

ESTABLISH MAXIMUM AMOUNTS FOR CREDIT CARD PURCHASES PROVIDED THEY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN NETWORKS OR ISSUERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS LAW, CUSTOMERS MAY BE INCENTIVIZED BY MERCHANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS TO

OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT, SUCH AS DEBIT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF BILLS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN INDIVIDUAL U.S. STATE LEGISLATURES IN RECENT YEARS SEEKING TO PERMIT MERCHANTS TO IMPOSE

SURCHARGES FOR THE USE OF CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS; TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE FEES; TO PROHIBIT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FROM CHARGING A MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE SALES TAX PORTION OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES; OR TO AFFECT THE TRANSPARENCY OF

CARD NETWORK RULES FOR MERCHANTS.

IN EUROPE, SOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS ITALY AND POLAND HAVE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED REGULATION OF

INTERCHANGE OR MERCHANT FEES. IN JANUARY 2012, THE EC PUBLISHED A GREEN PAPER (A DOCUMENT TO BEGIN A PROCESS OF CONSULTATION TOWARD POTENTIAL REGULATION) COVERING A RANGE OF ISSUES AFFECTING THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE EC HAS COMPLETED A CONSULTATION

PERIOD AND ISSUED ITS PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS IN THE FORM OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION ON JULY 24, 2013 (THE EU PAYMENTS PACKAGE). AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PROPOSED EU PAYMENTS PACKAGE ADDRESSES INTERCHANGE FEES, ANTI-STEERING AND

HONOR-ALL-CARDS RULES, SURCHARGING, SEPARATION OF PROCESSING FROM CARD NETWORK MANAGEMENT, ACCESS RIGHTS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS, PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO CROSS-BORDER ACQUIRING, MOBILE PAYMENTS AND TECHNICAL STANDARDIZATION. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OF

THE PROPOSALS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON US, SEE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  REGULATION ABOVE. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FINAL FORM, OR EFFECTS ON US, OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION. THESE AND OTHER POTENTIAL OR

PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DISCOUNT REVENUE DERIVED FROM OUR BUSINESS IN THE EU AS A RESULT OF DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM ANTICIPATED DECREASES IN COMPETITOR PRICING IN CONNECTION WITH

THE PROPOSED CAPS ON INTERCHANGE FEES. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO CARD ACCEPTANCE BY MERCHANTS, OR ALTER OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS IN THE EU, INCLUDING

ARRANGEMENTS WITH GNS PARTNERS. IF THE SCOPE OF PERMISSIBLE SURCHARGING OR STEERING IS EXPANDED, THERE COULD BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CARDS-IN-FORCE, TRANSACTION VOLUMES, DISCOUNT REVENUE OR OTHER PARAMETERS IMPACTING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. SEE



AN INCREASING PREVALENCE OF SURCHARGING BY MERCHANTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 BELOW. THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND

RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON US, SUCH AS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR RESULT IN

A REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR NETWORKS OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUES FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE AND

PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN

ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BUSINESS PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND

COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE

DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER

86

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR CARDS, NETWORKS AND OTHER SERVICES. BECAUSE OF EVOLVING PAYMENTS TECHNOLOGIES AND THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, WE MAY NOT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BE

SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING OR MAINTAINING OUR SHARE OF ONLINE SPENDING AND ENHANCING OUR CARD MEMBERS DIGITAL EXPERIENCE, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. WE ALSO EXPECT INCREASED REGULATORY AND LEGAL

SCRUTINY AND REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION IN CONNECTION WITH THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE OR ACCESS COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY BE LIMITED BY PATENT

RIGHTS THAT THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS, BY RESISTANCE TO CHANGE FROM CARD MEMBERS OR

MERCHANTS, BY THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR SYSTEMS OR BY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF

MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION. THESE MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND A RESULTING LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS, PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. GIVEN THE

COMPLEX, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION, A FUTURE ASSERTION OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST US COULD

CAUSE US TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE, ROYALTY OR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES.

REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND AFFECT OR LIMIT HOW WE COLLECT AND/OR USE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS APPLICABLE PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS, INCLUDING

REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION, AND WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT AND IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE.

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GLBA IMPOSES CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SHARE CONSUMERS NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES; REQUIRES THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE CERTAIN

DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR DATA COLLECTION, SHARING AND SECURITY PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES

(WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS); AND REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN A WRITTEN COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND

COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION PROCESSED BY THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE GLBA AND VARIOUS STATE LAWS, SEE PRIVACY AND DATA

PROTECTION UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ABOVE.

IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION

DIRECTIVE, WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER AND/OR PROCESSOR OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS IN

MEMBER STATES. AS THESE LAWS ARE INTERPRETED THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION, COMPLIANCE COSTS ARE INCREASING, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING THAT ADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION AND DATA TRANSFER MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

PROPOSED IN JANUARY 2012 A NEW REGULATION TO REPLACE THE CURRENT DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WOULD TIGHTEN DATA PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AND MAKE ENFORCEMENT MORE RIGOROUS, FOR EXAMPLE, BY STREAMLINING ENFORCEMENT AT A

EUROPEAN LEVEL, INTRODUCING DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASING PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. THIS PROPOSED REGULATION FOLLOWS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNIONS E-PRIVACY DIRECTIVE, WHICH IMPOSES CONSENT REQUIREMENTS

ON THE USE OF COOKIES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES SUCH AS ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISEMENT.

VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL BANKING

REGULATORS, STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS HAVE ENACTED DATA SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF INDIVIDUAL, CONSUMER, REGULATORY AND/OR LAW ENFORCEMENT

87

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTIFICATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. MANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS ALSO APPLY BROADLY TO MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AND OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS. IN MANY

COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE DATA SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION.

IN ADDITION, LEGISLATORS AND/OR REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE INCREASINGLY ADOPTING OR

REVISING PRIVACY, INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY-RELATED PRACTICES, OUR COLLECTION, USE, SHARING, RETENTION

AND SAFEGUARDING OF CONSUMER AND/OR EMPLOYEE INFORMATION, AND SOME OF OUR CURRENT OR PLANNED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATE CONSIDERED A NUMBER OF PRIVACY, SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION, CYBERSECURITY

AND INFORMATION-SECURITY RELATED BILLS DURING THE 113TH CONGRESS AND VARIOUS COMMITTEE HEARINGS WERE HELD ON RELATED SUBJECTS. THERE ALSO CONTINUES TO BE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THESE AREAS AT THE STATE LEVEL. NEW LEGISLATION OR REGULATION COULD

INCREASE OUR COSTS OF COMPLIANCE AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND COULD REDUCE REVENUES FROM CERTAIN BUSINESS INITIATIVES. MOREOVER, THE APPLICATION OF EXISTING LAWS TO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS CAN BE UNCERTAIN, INCREASING COMPLIANCE RISK.

COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT OR FUTURE PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT AFFECTING CUSTOMER

AND/OR EMPLOYEE DATA COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY EXPLOIT OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITY OR PROVIDE CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFITABILITY. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY LAWS COULD RESULT IN POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY AND/OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR ACTIONS, LITIGATION, FINES, SANCTIONS AND DAMAGE TO OUR

GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. OUR SENIOR

MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A CRITICAL PERIOD OF COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE

MARKET FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR CANDIDATES TO REPLACE OR SUCCEED MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  COMPENSATION PRACTICES ABOVE, OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF OUR U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE

SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FDIC AND THE OCC. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR COMPETITORS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FDIC OR OTHER

REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON ANY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES PURSUANT TO DODD-FRANK, COULD FURTHER AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF KEY

PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

TAX AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES OR ASSESSMENTS BY

GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE OPERATE IN

JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AS SUCH, WE REMIT A VARIETY OF TAXES AND FEES TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE TAXES AND FEES REMITTED BY US ARE

SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND AUDIT BY THE APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY FOR ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO UNCLAIMED OR ABANDONED PROPERTY (ESCHEAT) LAWS THAT REQUIRE US TO TURN OVER TO CERTAIN

GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS HELD BY US (SUCH AS UNCASHED STORED-VALUE PRODUCTS LIKE TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS) THAT HAS BEEN

88

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNCLAIMED FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO TAX AND UNCLAIMED PROPERTY MATTERS ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO VARYING INTERPRETATIONS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES OUR POSITIONS ARE REASONABLE, VARIOUS AUTHORITIES MAY CHALLENGE OUR POSITIONS OR APPLY EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MORE BROADLY, WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LIABILITIES FOR TAXES, UNCLAIMED PROPERTY AND

INTEREST IN EXCESS OF ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES MAY BE PROPOSED FROM TIME TO TIME, SUCH AS PROPOSALS FOR

FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES OR MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL ACTIONS TO ADDRESS BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING BY MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR TAX POSITIONS

AND/OR OUR TAX LIABILITIES. LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PROPOSED, AND IN SOME STATES ENACTED, TO ESTABLISH SHORTER ESCHEATMENT PERIODS FOR TRAVELERS CHECKS AND/OR PREPAID CARDS, OFTEN WITH RETROACTIVE APPLICATION. WE HAVE CHALLENGED, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE

TO CHALLENGE, WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE SIGNIFICANT DEFECTS IN THESE LAWS, WHICH CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND PREPAID CARDS BUSINESS IN THE STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE ENACTED, AS WELL AS INCREASE THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY

RECORDED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO UNCASHED STORED-VALUE PRODUCTS.

BUSINESS RISKS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDES CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS AND ISSUERS, PAPER-BASED TRANSACTIONS

(E.G., CASH AND CHECKS), BANK TRANSFER MODELS (E.G., WIRE TRANSFERS AND ACH), AS WELL AS EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS, SUCH AS AGGREGATORS AND WEB-BASED PAYMENT PLATFORMS (E.G., PAYPAL, SQUARE AND AMAZON), WIRELESS

PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS AND OTHER SYSTEMS LINKED TO PAYMENT CARDS. WE ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK ON A GLOBAL BASIS BASED ON PURCHASE VOLUME,

BEHIND VISA, MASTERCARD AND CHINA UNIONPAY. WE BELIEVE VISA AND MASTERCARD ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST COUNTRIES. AS A RESULT, COMPETITIVE CARD ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS ON THE VISA AND MASTERCARD NETWORKS MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE DOMINANT

POSITION, RESOURCES, MARKETING AND PRICING OF VISA AND MASTERCARD.

BECAUSE OF CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL

SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH A STRONG RELATIONSHIP

WITH US BEING ACQUIRED BY AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH A COMPETITOR, RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL LOSS OF BUSINESS FOR US. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND

ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG ALL ISSUERS REMAINS INTENSE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE,

INCLUDING LARGER CASH RESERVES, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION, CO-BRAND CARD PROGRAMS OR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE

HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS OR RESPOND OR ADAPT TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS AS EFFECTIVELY AS OUR COMPETITORS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE

PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ON DIFFERENT PLATFORMS THAN WE ARE. SPENDING ON OUR CHARGE, CREDIT AND PREPAID CARDS AND ACCOUNTS COULD CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY INCREASING CONSUMER USAGE OF DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETITIVE NETWORKS.

INTERNATIONALLY, COMPETITION REMAINS FIERCE, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCELERATING OUR GROWTH OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES THROUGH PROPRIETARY CONSUMER, SMALL BUSINESS AND CORPORATE PRODUCTS, GNS PARTNERS AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES SUCH AS PREPAID SERVICES.

89

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING CONTINUING ADVANCEMENTS IN THE AREAS OF PROXIMITY PAYMENT

DEVICES (SUCH AS CONTACTLESS CARDS) AND REMOTE PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (SUCH AS CLOUD BASED ACCOUNTS), AND EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND TRANSACT BUSINESS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS

CONNECTION, TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL COMPETITORS SUCH AS MOBILE, TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND AGGREGATORS ARE WORKING TO DELIVER DIGITAL AND MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES FOR BOTH CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE

ABLE TO INNOVATE FASTER THAN WE CAN, AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES BY ENABLING OUR COMPETITORS TO OFFER MORE EFFICIENT OR LOWER-COST SERVICES. OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP NEW

TECHNOLOGIES AND ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP PACE WITH INNOVATION, MANAGE THE SHIFT TO MOBILE, DEVICE-BASED AND MULTI-CHANNEL COMMERCE OR IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE CARD MEMBER

EXPERIENCE, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

VEHICLES THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH CONTINUE TO EMERGE AND GROW, AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND BOTH ON- AND OFF-LINE AND ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD

FURTHER REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE.

TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS, SYSTEMS AND

PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND IN THE ONLINE AND MOBILE PAYMENTS SPACE, OUR DISCOUNT REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. OUR ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP FOCUSES ON

THIS STRATEGIC CHALLENGE BY LEVERAGING ITS SERVE SOFTWARE PLATFORM TO DEVELOP LOW-COST AND MORE EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL BANKING, PAYMENT AND PREPAID SERVICES. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO GENERATE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE GLOBALLY IN

AREAS SUCH AS ALTERNATIVE MOBILE AND ONLINE PAYMENTS, FEE-BASED SERVICES AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMER SEGMENTS MOVE AND MANAGE THEIR MONEY. WHILE EXPANDING THE ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR US, MANY

OF THE GROWTH INITIATIVES WILL INVOLVE NEW AREAS FOR US AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY. OUR FAILURE TO EXPAND ENTERPRISE GROWTH AND DRIVE ADOPTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGY AND PAYMENT OPTIONS

SUCH AS PREPAID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE OFFER, WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE GROWTH.

OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE

OFFERED BY OUR ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP, COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT PRODUCTS INCLUDING CASH, FOREIGN AND DIGITAL CURRENCIES, CHECKS, OTHER BRANDS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, DEBIT, PREPAID AND ATM CARDS, STORE BRANDED GIFT CARDS, OTHER

NETWORK BRANDED CARDS AND OTHER PAYMENT CARDS. THESE PAYMENT PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE AND INCREASING COMPETITION. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH COMPANIES THAT MARKET OPEN-LOOP PREPAID DEBIT CARDS THROUGH RETAIL AND ONLINE DISTRIBUTION, BANKS AND OTHER

PROVIDERS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT AND SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, OTHER ISSUERS OF DEBIT CARDS, CHECK CASHERS, MONEY ORDER SERVICES, AND LARGE RETAILERS OR RETAILER COALITIONS WHO ARE SEEKING TO INTEGRATE MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES INTO THEIR PRODUCT

OFFERINGS. WE ANTICIPATE INCREASED COMPETITION FROM TRADITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS THAT ARE OFTEN WELL-POSITIONED TO SERVICE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THOSE PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED OR POORLY SERVED BY THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL

SYSTEM, AND THAT MAY WISH TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN PREPAID CARD PROGRAMS. THE INCREASED DESIRE OF BANKS, RETAILERS AND ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP AND PROMOTE PREPAID CARD PROGRAMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR PREPAID

OFFERINGS, SUCH AS AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVE.

TO THE EXTENT WE EXPAND INTO NEW BUSINESS AREAS AND NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WE MAY

FACE COMPETITORS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND MORE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH RELEVANT CUSTOMERS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES THAT CONTROL ACCESS TO CONSUMER AND

MERCHANT PAYMENT METHOD PREFERENCES THROUGH DIGITAL WALLETS, MOBILE APPLICATIONS OR AT THE POINT-OF-SALE COULD CHOOSE NOT TO ACCEPT OR COULD SUPPRESS USE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR COULD RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND TRANSACTION DATA. LAWS AND

BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT FAVOR LOCAL COMPETITORS, REQUIRE CARD TRANSACTIONS TO BE ROUTED OVER DOMESTIC NETWORKS OR PROHIBIT OR LIMIT FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES COULD SLOW OUR GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL REGIONS. FURTHER, EXPANDING OUR

SERVICE OFFERINGS, ADDING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION CHANNELS AND FORMING NEW PARTNERSHIPS COULD HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES THAN OUR CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE OR DILUTE OUR BRAND.

90

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES,

INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND PROPOSALS TO IMPOSE TAXES OR FEES ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE OR

SIMILAR PROPOSALS, WHICH MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

WE FACE INCREASINGLY

INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON HIGH REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARD MEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES

CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARD MEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MARKET PRESSURE,

INCLUDING PRESSURE CREATED BY REGULATORY-MANDATED REDUCTIONS TO COMPETITORS PRICING, TO REDUCE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENTIATED PAYMENT MODELS FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE

ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS SPACE AND THE REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT COULD POSE CHALLENGES TO OUR TRADITIONAL PAYMENT MODEL AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE. SOME MERCHANTS ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THEIR OWN PAYMENT SOLUTIONS,

USING BOTH TRADITIONAL AND NEW TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. IF MERCHANTS ARE ABLE TO DRIVE BROAD CONSUMER ADOPTION AND USAGE, IT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE AND BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES.

A CONTINUING PRIORITY OF OURS IS TO DRIVE GREATER VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS, WHICH, IF NOT SUCCESSFUL, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DISCOUNT

REVENUE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE, WE WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO OFFSET THE FINANCIAL IMPACT BY INCREASING BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES, INCREASING OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE, SUCH AS

FEE-BASED REVENUE OR INTEREST INCOME, OR BOTH. WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN SUSTAINING MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES OR OFFSETTING THE IMPACT OF DECLINING MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY, AND THEREFORE OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN INNOVATION AND IN VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBERS.

AN INCREASING PREVALENCE OF SURCHARGING BY MERCHANTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN MEMBER STATES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, MERCHANTS ARE PERMITTED BY LAW TO SURCHARGE CARD

PURCHASES. THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THE EU THAT PERMIT SURCHARGING COULD INCREASE AS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL CONSIDER RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO CHANGE SURCHARGING LAWS, AS DISCUSSED IN GLOBAL

NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  REGULATION ABOVE. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FINAL FORM, OR EFFECTS ON US, OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION. IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS

CARDS IN CERTAIN MERCHANT CATEGORIES AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, WHICH IS KNOWN AS DIFFERENTIAL SURCHARGING. NEW RULES ISSUED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA THAT TOOK

EFFECT IN 2013 ALLOW US AND OTHER PAYMENT NETWORKS TO PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING BY MORE THAN THEIR REASONABLE COSTS OF ACCEPTING A PARTICULAR PAYMENT CARD. THIS COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT DIFFERENTIALLY

SURCHARGE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

THE SETTLEMENT BY MASTERCARD AND VISA OF A MERCHANT CLASS LITIGATION REQUIRED, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, MASTERCARD AND VISA TO PERMIT U.S. MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE MASTERCARD AND VISA CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WHILE PERMITTING THE NETWORKS TO CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT SURCHARGES ON DEBIT CARD

TRANSACTIONS. MASTERCARD AND VISAS REVISED NETWORK RULES THAT WENT INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY 2013 PROHIBIT MERCHANTS THAT ALSO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS FROM IMPLEMENTING SURCHARGES OF MASTERCARD AND/OR VISA CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS UNLESS

THEY ALSO SURCHARGE AMERICAN EXPRESS TRANSACTIONS IN A MANNER THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE NON-DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS GENERALLY AGREED TO BY MOST MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (I.E., BY SURCHARGING AMERICAN EXPRESS

TRANSACTIONS BUT NOT SURCHARGING MASTERCARD

91

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND VISA DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS). THIS MAY ENCOURAGE MERCHANTS THAT CURRENTLY ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS TO EITHER VIOLATE THEIR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS OR TO

DISCONTINUE ACCEPTANCE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. IF THIS OCCURS, IT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT COVERAGE AND CHARGE VOLUMES.

IN DECEMBER 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF U.S. MERCHANT CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS UNDER WHICH WE WOULD CHANGE OUR U.S. CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT PROVISIONS TO PERMIT MERCHANTS TO SURCHARGE

AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS NO MORE THAN THE SURCHARGE ON OTHER CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS OR OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT THE MERCHANT ACCEPTS (OTHER THAN CASH, CHECKS, DEBIT CARDS OR INTER-BANK TRANSFERS). WHILE WE CONTINUE TO

BELIEVE SURCHARGING IS NOT A CUSTOMER-FRIENDLY PRACTICE, THIS PROPOSED SETTLEMENT PROVIDES MERCHANTS WITH ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO SURCHARGE AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH OTHER CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS, EVEN IF THE

MERCHANT DOES NOT SURCHARGE DEBIT CARDS. WE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO PUT THESE CONTRACT CHANGES INTO EFFECT ANY SOONER THAN THE DATE THAT THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT RECEIVES FINAL APPROVAL, INCLUDING ANY APPEAL PERIOD. IF THE SETTLEMENT RECEIVES FINAL

APPROVAL, THESE CONTRACT CHANGES, COMBINED WITH U.S. MERCHANTS OPTIONS UNDER DODD-FRANK TO OFFER DISCOUNTS OR INCENTIVES TO INDUCE PAYMENT BY DEBIT CARDS COULD SHIFT SPENDING FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS TO DEBIT CARDS. FOR

MORE DETAIL ON THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, SEE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

IF SURCHARGING BECOMES WIDESPREAD, AMERICAN

EXPRESS CARDS AND CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS GENERALLY COULD BECOME LESS DESIRABLE TO CONSUMERS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN CARDS-IN-FORCE AND TRANSACTION VOLUMES. THE IMPACT COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE MANNER IN WHICH A SURCHARGE IS LEVIED

AND WHETHER SURCHARGES ARE LEVIED UPON ALL PAYMENT CARDS, WHETHER DEBIT CARDS ARE EXCLUDED, OR WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF THE SURCHARGE VARIES DEPENDING ON THE CARD, NETWORK, ACQUIRER OR ISSUER. SURCHARGING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY TO THE EXTENT SURCHARGING DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD MEMBERS.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE CARD USAGE THROUGH OUR MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS, OR TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE COSTS OF SUCH PROGRAMS, BOTH OF WHICH MAY IMPACT

OUR PROFITABILITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY OUR CARD MEMBERS. INCREASING

CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID

PRODUCTS AND INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARD MEMBERS, REDUCE CARD MEMBER ATTRITION AND SEEK TO RETAIN OR CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARD MEMBER BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST-EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARD MEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARD MEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES. OUR

PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH ALSO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE BY OFFERING NEW, AND ADDING VALUE TO OUR EXISTING, PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR NEW OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT VALUE, THEY MAY FAIL TO ACCEPT OUR NEW

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING REVENUES. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE INSTITUTED REWARDS AND CO-BRAND PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS, AND ISSUERS MAY IN THE FUTURE INSTITUTE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN OURS.

IF WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS,

WE WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO OFFSET THE FINANCIAL IMPACT BY INCREASING PAYMENTS VOLUME, THE AMOUNT OF FEE-BASED SERVICES WE PROVIDE OR BOTH. WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN DOING SO, PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY, AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, AND WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO PRESERVE, GROW AND LEVERAGE THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARD MEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR

92

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEVEL OF SERVICE, TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUSINESS PRACTICES, MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE QUALITIES. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS 

EVEN IF RELATED TO SEEMINGLY ISOLATED INCIDENTS  COULD ERODE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CARD MEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARD MEMBERS AND

CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES. NEGATIVE PUBLIC OPINION COULD ALSO RESULT FROM ACTUAL OR ALLEGED CONDUCT IN ANY NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES OR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING CARD PRACTICES, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND THE USE AND PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER

INFORMATION, AND FROM ACTIONS TAKEN BY REGULATORS OR OTHERS IN RESPONSE TO SUCH CONDUCT. SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS CAN ALSO CAUSE RAPID, WIDESPREAD REPUTATIONAL HARM TO OUR BRAND.

OUR BRAND AND REPUTATION MAY ALSO BE HARMED BY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, ANY SHORTCOMING OF A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR OR GNS PARTNER THAT ISSUES CARDS OR

ACQUIRES MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK MAY BE ATTRIBUTED BY CARD MEMBERS AND MERCHANTS TO US, THUS DAMAGING OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND VALUE. THE LACK OF ACCEPTANCE OR SUPPRESSION OF CARD USAGE BY MERCHANTS CAN ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT

PERCEPTIONS OF OUR BRAND AND OUR PRODUCTS, LOWER OVERALL TRANSACTION VOLUME AND INCREASE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OTHER PAYMENTS SYSTEMS. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR

RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR LITIGATION AGAINST US. FURTHERMORE, AS A CORPORATION WITH HEADQUARTERS AND OPERATIONS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF THE UNITED STATES ARISING FROM ITS POLITICAL OR

OTHER POSITIONS COULD HARM THE PERCEPTION OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR BRAND. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES

AND PROFITABILITY.

IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY, OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IMPORTANT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS, WHICH MAY RESULT

IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND DRIVE LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE, AND INCLUDE.



INCREASING PLASTIC PENETRATION, INCLUDING BY GROWING OUR SHARE OF PREMIUM AND SMALL BUSINESS SPEND AND B2B PAYMENTS



CONTINUING TO EXPAND INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH PROPRIETARY AND GNS OFFERINGS



EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE IN THE DIGITAL PAYMENTS SPACE, INCLUDING ONLINE AND MOBILE CHANNELS



GROWING OUR LOYALTY COALITION BUSINESS, LOYALTY PARTNER, AND OUR NEWER PAYMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SERVE AND BLUEBIRD

THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ENHANCING EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS COMPLEX, COSTLY AND UNCERTAIN, AND

ANY FAILURE BY US TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS ACCURATELY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM OUR MARKET SHARE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ALSO CONTINUE TO PURSUE A DISCIPLINED EXPENSE-MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, INCLUDING REENGINEERING OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE

THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF EXPENSES IN THE FUTURE, PARTICULARLY AS EXPENSES INCURRED IN OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE VOLATILITY AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL AND RELATED COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT

OR CONTROL, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CURRENT REGULATORY AND LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT. MOREOVER, WE HAVE INCURRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR, COSTS OF INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESSES. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT BE AS PRODUCTIVE AS WE EXPECT OR AT ALL.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN REALIZING THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES AND INVESTMENT

ACTIVITY, AND OUR BUSINESS AND REPUTATION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

WE HAVE RECENTLY ACQUIRED A NUMBER OF

BUSINESSES, INCLUDING OUR ACQUISITIONS OF SERVE, ACCERTIFY AND LOYALTY PARTNER, AND MADE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. WE MAY ALSO EVALUATE OTHER POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE

93

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY SUITABLE CANDIDATES, VALUE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OR ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ACCURATELY AND NEGOTIATE ACCEPTABLE TERMS FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES, AND

COMPLETE PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, BUSINESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION OR

INVESTMENT, INCUR UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AND HARM OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY.

AS DISCUSSED IN GLOBAL BUSINESS

TRAVEL UNDER GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES ABOVE, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CREATE A NEW JOINT VENTURE FOR OUR GBT OPERATIONS. THE TRANSACTION REMAINS SUBJECT TO THE EXECUTION OF DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND RECEIPT OF REGULATORY AND OTHER

APPROVALS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTION. IF WE ARE ABLE TO CLOSE THE TRANSACTION, THE JOINT VENTURE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION, INCLUDING

ACCELERATING THE TRANSFORMATION AND GROWTH OF THE CORPORATE TRAVEL BUSINESS, CREATING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT CAPACITY AND ENHANCING ITS SUITE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOLLOWING AND CONTINUING AFTER THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTION, WE AND THE

JOINT VENTURE FACE THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF KEY CUSTOMERS, VENDORS AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS. OUR FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE RISKS OR OTHER PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION COULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO REALIZE THE

ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF SUCH TRANSACTION, INCUR UNANTICIPATED LIABILITIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

JOINT VENTURES

AND MINORITY INVESTMENTS INHERENTLY INVOLVE A LESSER DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER BUSINESS OPERATIONS, THEREBY POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE FINANCIAL, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL AND/OR COMPLIANCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOINT VENTURE OR MINORITY INVESTMENT. IN

ADDITION, WE MAY BE DEPENDENT ON JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS, CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OR MANAGEMENT WHO MAY HAVE BUSINESS INTERESTS, STRATEGIES OR GOALS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OURS. BUSINESS DECISIONS OR OTHER ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF THE JOINT

VENTURE PARTNER, CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OR MANAGEMENT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT, RESULT IN LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST US AND OTHERWISE DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND.

A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS

COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES PROCESS, TRANSMIT AND STORE ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS AND PREPAID

PRODUCTS, AND IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE COLLECT, ANALYZE AND RETAIN SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES OF CERTAIN TYPES OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE AND OTHER INFORMATION PERTAINING TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES.

INFORMATION SECURITY RISKS FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US HAVE GENERALLY INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOUR

CATEGORIES OF THREAT ACTORS THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE POSE THE GREATEST RISK, NAMELY CYBER CRIMINALS, NATION STATE SPONSORED GROUPS, DETERMINED INSIDERS AND HACKTIVISTS OR SOCIAL OBJECTORS. THESE THREAT ACTORS ARE USING

INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARD MEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT, TO DISRUPT INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND TO EXPOSE AND EXPLOIT POTENTIAL SECURITY AND PRIVACY VULNERABILITIES IN CORPORATE SYSTEMS AND WEBSITES. AS OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION OF FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY INCREASE, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES

INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS AND THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS AND OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, MAY BE COMPROMISED.

WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO DETECT AND PREVENT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND

MAINTENANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE COSTLY AND REQUIRE ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CHANGE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY MEASURES BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF DATA

BREACHES, MALICIOUS SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND FRAUDULENT OR OTHER MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN, INCLUDING THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE, RELEASE, GATHERING, MONITORING, MISUSE, LOSS OR

DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETARY AND OTHER INFORMATION (INCLUDING ACCOUNT DATA INFORMATION).

94

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND

SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS, MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE DISRUPTIONS OR DEGRADATION BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY MALFUNCTION, SUDDEN INCREASES IN CUSTOMER TRANSACTION VOLUME, NATURAL DISASTERS, ACCIDENTS, POWER OUTAGES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, FRAUD,

DENIAL-OF-SERVICE AND OTHER CYBER ATTACKS, TERRORISM, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, OR SIMILAR EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE AND OTHER U.S. FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS WERE TARGETED RECENTLY WITH DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE

ATTACKS FROM SOPHISTICATED THIRD PARTIES. SERVICE DISRUPTIONS COULD PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR ONLINE SERVICES AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION, COMPROMISE COMPANY OR CUSTOMER DATA, AND IMPEDE TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING. INADEQUATE

INFRASTRUCTURE IN LESSER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES COULD ALSO RESULT IN SERVICE DISRUPTIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN THOSE COUNTRIES.

IF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH OR IF ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED FRAUD LEVELS OR OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES INVOLVING OUR CARDS WERE TO RISE DUE TO THE ACTIONS

OF THIRD PARTIES, EMPLOYEE ERROR, MALFEASANCE OR OTHERWISE, IT COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION (SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE), INCREASED LITIGATION AND REMEDIATION COSTS, GREATER CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS AND/OR BUSINESS PARTNERS RELATING TO

THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF THEIR DATA, AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. DATA BREACHES AND OTHER ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED

FAILURES TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY, TRS AND ITS U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES BY BANKING REGULATORS.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND ALLIANCES OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF

INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COSTCO AND DELTA AIR LINES TO OFFER CO-BRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE

AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARD MEMBER PARTICIPANTS. COMPETITION FOR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY BUSINESS PARTNERS IS VERY INTENSE AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE WE WILL BE ABLE TO GROW OR MAINTAIN THESE PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS. WE FACE THE RISK

THAT WE COULD LOSE PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS, EVEN AFTER WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES, TIME AND EXPENSE IN ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING THE RELATIONSHIPS. THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF CARD MEMBER ATTRITION OR ADDITIONAL COSTS WE INCUR TO RETAIN CARD MEMBERS.

WE

MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE OR ACCELERATE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN BUSINESS PARTNERS SUCH AS CO-BRAND PARTNERS AND MERCHANTS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS SUCH AS: (I) OUR FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY, (II) OUR ECONOMIC CONDITION

DETERIORATING SUCH THAT OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING IS DOWNGRADED SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE BY S&P AND MOODYS, (III) OUR CEASING TO HAVE A PUBLIC DEBT RATING, OR (IV) A SHORTFALL IN CERTAIN PERFORMANCE LEVELS. IF

WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, WE HAVE CREDIT RISK TO

CERTAIN CO-BRAND PARTNERS RELATING TO OUR PREPAYMENTS FOR LOYALTY PROGRAM POINTS THAT MAY NOT BE FULLY REDEEMED. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES, LIQUIDATIONS, INSOLVENCIES, FINANCIAL DISTRESS, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER

SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT PARTICULAR CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE WERE OBLIGATED TO OR ELECTED TO REIMBURSE CARD MEMBERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PURCHASED FROM MERCHANTS THAT HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS OR STOPPED ACCEPTING OUR CARDS.

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS AND IN RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES,

RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 9 PERCENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

95

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THERE CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE

UNITED STATES (E.G., AMERICAN/US AIRWAYS AND UNITED AIRLINES/CONTINENTAL AIRLINES), THROUGH MERGERS AND/OR GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES AND JOINT VENTURES, AND THIS TREND COULD CONTINUE. IN PARTICULAR, THE UNITED STATES

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS GRANTED ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO MEMBERS OF THE SKYTEAM, STAR AND ONEWORLD ALLIANCES, ENABLING THE COVERED AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR CROSS-REGIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT VENTURES IN

TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS, INCLUDING JOINTLY PRICING AND MANAGING CAPACITY ON COVERED ROUTES, SHARING REVENUES AND COSTS, AND COORDINATING SALES AND CORPORATE CONTRACTS, ALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. THE EC HAS SIMILARLY

APPROVED THE STAR AND ONEWORLD ALLIANCES, AND ITS REVIEW OF THE SKYTEAM ALLIANCE AND COOPERATION BETWEEN ITS MEMBERS IS CONTINUING. INCREASING CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANDED ANTITRUST IMMUNITY COULD CREATE CHALLENGES FOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE

AIRLINES INCLUDING REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY ON OUR AIRLINE BUSINESS.

AIRLINES ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND

VALUABLE PARTNERS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. IF A PARTICIPATING AIRLINE MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION. SIMILARLY,

IF ONE OF OUR CO-BRAND AIRLINE PARTNERS MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT HAD A COMPETING CO-BRAND CARD, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH CO-BRAND CARDS IT WOULD OFFER. OUR LARGEST AIRLINE CO-BRAND LOAN PORTFOLIO, AMERICAN EXPRESS

DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARD, ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN 15 PERCENT OF WORLDWIDE CARD MEMBER LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.

IF AN AIRLINE DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW FROM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS OR TO CEASE OFFERING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CO-BRAND CARD, WHETHER AS THE

RESULT OF A MERGER OR OTHERWISE, SUCH AS THE WITHDRAWAL OF CONTINENTAL AIRLINES IN 2011 FROM OUR AIRPORT CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARD MEMBERS AND OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS TRANSFER PROGRAM OR THE WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICAN

AIRLINES IN 2014 FROM OUR AIRPORT CLUB ACCESS PROGRAM FOR CENTURION AND PLATINUM CARD MEMBERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE GENERAL RISKS RELATED TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, SEE RISK

MANAGEMENT  EXPOSURE TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY ON PAGE 44 OF OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE SUCCESSFUL, AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED.

MANY FACTORS CAN INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT OF OUR EXPENSES, AS WELL AS HOW QUICKLY THEY MAY INCREASE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY BE

NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS, MAY INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS

(INCLUDING THE REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE), ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME.

THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO

LOWER-COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET AND MOBILE CHANNELS TO SAVE COSTS AND PLANNED STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS

IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, OR IF THE ACTIONS TAKEN ULTIMATELY COME AT THE EXPENSE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED. FAILURE TO

ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS OR SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR EXPENSES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED FINANCIAL TARGETS.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO MITIGATE RISK AND APPROPRIATELY BALANCE RISK AND RETURN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INTENDED TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE TYPES OF RISK TO

WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, INCLUDING CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, ASSET LIABILITY RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, COMPLIANCE RISK AND

96

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPUTATIONAL RISK. SEE RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES 43-46 OF OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND

MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES, MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. IN ADDITION, AS REGULATIONS AND MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK MAY NOT ALWAYS KEEP SUFFICIENT PACE WITH THOSE

CHANGES. IF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY OR MITIGATE OUR RISKS, WE COULD SUFFER UNEXPECTED LOSSES AND COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANAGEMENT OF OUR RISKS IN SOME CASES DEPENDS UPON THE USE OF ANALYTICAL AND/OR FORECASTING MODELS. IF THE MODELS WE USE TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE INADEQUATE, WE MAY INCUR INCREASED LOSSES. IN ADDITION,

THERE MAY BE RISKS THAT EXIST, OR THAT DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, THAT WE HAVE NOT APPROPRIATELY ANTICIPATED, IDENTIFIED OR MITIGATED.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS, SETTLEMENT WITH GNS PARTNERS, MERCHANT AND CONSUMER BANKRUPTCIES, DELINQUENCIES AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS THAT CAN AFFECT

SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISK, PRINCIPALLY FROM

CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM MERCHANTS, GNS PARTNERS, GCP CLIENTS AND TREASURY AND INVESTMENT COUNTERPARTIES. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO CREDIT RISK. OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS CREDITWORTHINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THE CRITERIA OR MODELS WE USE TO MANAGE OUR CREDIT

RISK BECOME LESS PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE LOSSES, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR LOSSES TO RISE AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE

US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES. ALTHOUGH DELINQUENCIES AND CHARGE-OFFS DECLINED IN 2013, WE BELIEVE WE ARE EXPERIENCING HISTORICAL LOWS IN THESE RATES AND THEY ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE. IN ADDITION, IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DO NOT IMPROVE,

THESE RATES MAY INCREASE MORE THAN EXPECTED. HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS. IN ADDITION, OUR

ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF MAY BE LIMITED, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION WE USE IN MANAGING OUR

CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY

ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. INCREASED CREDIT RISK, WHETHER RESULTING FROM UNDERESTIMATING

THE CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN OUR MIX OF BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE, COULD REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED.

MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD BUSINESS AND IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. CHANGES IN THE

INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST YIELD, AND CONSEQUENTLY

OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL.

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS AND OUR LIABILITIES AND,

IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT READILY MARKETABLE, INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

97

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. LIQUIDITY

RISK IS DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO ACCESS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK, WE MAY MAINTAIN TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY, WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND

LIMIT FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY; OR WE MAY BE TOO ILLIQUID, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING A LIQUIDITY EVENT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK, SEE 

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET

CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL

 ABOVE.

FINALLY, WE MUST ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF

NOT ACHIEVING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO INADEQUATE OR FAILED PROCESSES OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, POOR DATA QUALITY, HUMAN ERROR OR THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT (I.E., NATURAL DISASTERS). OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDES, AMONG OTHERS, THE RISK THAT EMPLOYEE

ERROR OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL FINANCIAL MISSTATEMENT; A FAILURE TO MONITOR AN OUTSOURCE PARTNERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT OR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS; OR A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR AND

CONTROL ACCESS TO DATA IN OUR SYSTEMS WE GRANT TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. AS PROCESSES ARE CHANGED, OR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE INTRODUCED, WE MAY NOT FULLY APPRECIATE OR IDENTIFY NEW OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CHANGES.

COMPLIANCE RISK ARISES FROM THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS AND INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS CAN EXPOSE US TO REPUTATIONAL RISKS AS WELL AS FINES, CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES OR PAYMENT OF

DAMAGES AND CAN LEAD TO DIMINISHED BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND DIMINISHED ABILITY TO EXPAND KEY OPERATIONS.

AN INABILITY TO ACCEPT OR

MAINTAIN DEPOSITS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND OR REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING, OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS PERSONAL SAVINGS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $40.8 BILLION IN TOTAL U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS. MANY OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS ARE INCREASING THEIR USE OF DEPOSIT FUNDING, AND AS SUCH WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE DEPOSIT

MARKETS, PARTICULARLY AS TO BROKERAGE NETWORKS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW THIS INCREASED COMPETITION WILL AFFECT DEPOSIT RENEWAL RATES, COSTS OR AVAILABILITY. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO OFFER HIGHER INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS, OUR FUNDING

COSTS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS ALSO

IS DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE

PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS (1) IT IS WELL CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

OUR OUTSTANDING U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAS BEEN RAISED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKERAGE NETWORKS, AND SUCH DEPOSITS ARE CONSIDERED BROKERED DEPOSITS FOR BANK REGULATORY PURPOSES. A BANK THAT IS LESS THAN WELL CAPITALIZED GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN

INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC UNLESS THE FDIC DETERMINES THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN A HIGH-RATE AREA. AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED

INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION MAY NOT ACCEPT, RENEW OR ROLL OVER ANY BROKERED DEPOSIT UNLESS IT HAS APPLIED FOR AND BEEN GRANTED A WAIVER OF THIS PROHIBITION BY THE FDIC. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT SOLICIT DEPOSITS BY OFFERING

INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATES OF INTEREST ON INSURED DEPOSITS IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS NORMAL MARKET AREAS OR IN THE MARKET AREA IN WHICH SUCH DEPOSITS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTED. THERE ARE NO SUCH

RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL CAPITALIZED (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE

ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL REGULATOR DETERMINES THAT IT IS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION OR IS ENGAGING IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICES, THE REGULATOR MAY RECLASSIFY A WELL CAPITALIZED

INSTITUTION AS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIRE AN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AS IF IT WERE UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND REQUIRE AN UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTION TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS APPLICABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY

UNDERCAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS.

98

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB WERE CONSIDERED WELL CAPITALIZED FOR THESE

PURPOSES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THIS DEFINITION. THE NEW CAPITAL RULES, WHEN FULLY PHASED-IN, WILL REQUIRE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR BANK SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY

MORE CAPITAL, WITH A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COMMON EQUITY. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REGULATORS CAN ADJUST THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED AT ANY TIME AND HAVE AUTHORITY TO PLACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR DEPOSIT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE INTEREST RATE WE PAY

ON DEPOSITS. AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS IN THE FUTURE COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, PLATFORMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

WE OPERATE A SERVICE NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE

OUTSOURCE TO THIRD-PARTY VENDORS MANY OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THIS OUTSOURCING OCCURS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ALSO RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO

INTERACT WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT OR REGULATORY OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN ECONOMIC AND REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THE

CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY AND/OR SECURITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES OR COMMUNICATED OVER THIRD-PARTY NETWORKS OR PLATFORMS COULD BECOME COMPROMISED. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY

AND DECREASES OUR CONTROL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF CERTAIN OUTSOURCINGS WILL DECREASE AS THE DEMAND FOR THESE SERVICES INCREASES AROUND THE WORLD.

ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, PROCESSORS, AGGREGATORS, GNS PARTNERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF ACCURATE INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL

NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER OR OTHER THIRD PARTY FAILS TO PROVIDE THE DATA QUALITY, COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER, OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS, TERRORISM, HACKING OR OTHER CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS OR

ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OR COMPROMISE THE QUALITY OF OUR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. SEE 

A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OR BREACH IN THE SECURITY OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OR AN INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING

OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS

 ABOVE.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS.

GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, HEALTH PANDEMICS, INTRUSION INTO OR DEGRADATION OF

OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BY HACKERS AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11,

2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM

TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS IS LIKELY TO DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS. IN ADDITION,

DISRUPTIONS IN AIR TRAVEL AND OTHER FORMS OF TRAVEL CAUSED BY SUCH EVENTS CAN RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS UNDER TRAVEL INTERRUPTION INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WE OFFER AND, IF SUCH DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL ARE PROLONGED, THEY CAN MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OVERALL TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING. IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) RESULT IN WIDESPREAD OR LENGTHY DISRUPTIONS TO TRAVEL, THEY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CARD MEMBER SPENDING MAY ALSO

BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN AREAS AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. THE IMPACT OF SUCH EVENTS ON THE OVERALL ECONOMY MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PROPERTIES

OUR

PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE IN A 51-STORY, 2.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT BUILDING LOCATED IN LOWER MANHATTAN ON LAND LEASED FROM THE BATTERY PARK CITY AUTHORITY FOR A TERM EXPIRING IN 2069. WE HAVE A 49 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE BUILDING

AND BROOKFIELD FINANCIAL PROPERTIES OWNS THE REMAINING 51 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. WE ALSO LEASE SPACE IN THE BUILDING FROM BROOKFIELD.

OTHER OWNED OR LEASED PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS CURRENTLY INCLUDE THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE CENTERS IN FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA, PHOENIX, ARIZONA, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, MEXICO CITY, MEXICO, SYDNEY,

AUSTRALIA, GURGAON, INDIA AND BRIGHTON, ENGLAND; THE AMERICAN EXPRESS DATA CENTERS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, AND GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA; A MULTI-BUILDING CAMPUS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA; THE HEADQUARTERS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS

SERVICES EUROPE LIMITED IN LONDON, ENGLAND; AND THE AMEX BANK OF CANADA AND AMEX CANADA INC. HEADQUARTERS IN MARKHAM, ONTARIO, CANADA.

DURING 2004 AND 2005, WE ENGAGED IN SEVERAL SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE SOLD VARIOUS OWNED PROPERTIES TO THIRD PARTIES AND LEASED BACK THE PROPERTIES UNDER LONG-TERM NET LEASES

WHEREBY EACH AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITY THAT LEASES BACK THE PROPERTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, UTILITIES, OPERATING EXPENSES AND INSURANCE COSTS) IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL RENT. THE

SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS HAVE NOT MATERIALLY IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY YEAR. GAINS RESULTING FROM COMPLETED SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE INITIAL TEN-YEAR LEASE PERIODS. WE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER WHETHER

SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER PROPERTIES THAT WE CURRENTLY OWN.

GENERALLY, WE LEASE THE PREMISES WE

OCCUPY IN OTHER LOCATIONS. WE BELIEVE THE FACILITIES WE OWN OR OCCUPY SUIT OUR NEEDS AND ARE WELL MAINTAINED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, ARISING OUT OF THE CONDUCT

OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO EACH OF THESE ACTIONS AND INTEND TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY. IN THE COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS,

INFORMATION GATHERING REQUESTS, SUBPOENAS, INQUIRIES

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND INVESTIGATIONS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE NOT A PARTY TO, NOR ARE ANY OF OUR PROPERTIES THE SUBJECT OF, ANY PENDING LEGAL, ARBITRATION, REGULATORY OR INVESTIGATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD AS THE PROCEEDINGS

ARE RESOLVED. CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING US OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOR THOSE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND

GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS DISCLOSED BELOW WHERE A LOSS IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHETHER IN EXCESS OF A RELATED ACCRUED LIABILITY OR WHERE THERE IS NO ACCRUED LIABILITY, AND FOR WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS,

THE CURRENT ESTIMATED RANGE IS ZERO TO $440 MILLION IN EXCESS OF THE ACCRUED LIABILITY (IF ANY) RELATED TO THOSE MATTERS. THIS AGGREGATE RANGE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS AND IS BASED ON

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THIS ESTIMATED RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS DOES NOT REPRESENT OUR MAXIMUM LOSS EXPOSURE. THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS UNDERLYING THE ESTIMATED RANGE WILL CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND ACTUAL RESULTS

MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT ESTIMATES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 24 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 101-102 OF OUR 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS.

CORPORATE MATTERS

DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AS REGULATORY INTEREST IN CREDIT CARD NETWORK PRICING TO MERCHANTS OR TERMS OF MERCHANT RULES AND CONTRACTS HAS

INCREASED, WE HAVE RESPONDED TO MANY INQUIRIES FROM BANKING AND COMPETITION AUTHORITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

IN 2010, THE

DOJ, ALONG WITH ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM ARIZONA, CONNECTICUT, HAWAII (HAWAII HAS SINCE WITHDRAWN ITS CLAIM), IDAHO, ILLINOIS, IOWA, MARYLAND, MICHIGAN, MISSOURI, MONTANA, NEBRASKA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, OHIO, RHODE ISLAND, TENNESSEE, TEXAS, UTAH AND VERMONT

FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AGAINST US, MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND VISA, INC., ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT THE

DEFENDANTS POLICIES PROHIBITING MERCHANTS FROM STEERING A CUSTOMER TO USE ANOTHER NETWORKS CARD, ANOTHER TYPE OF CARD OR ANOTHER METHOD OF PAYMENT (ANTI-STEERING AND NON-DISCRIMINATION RULES AND CONTRACTUAL

PROVISIONS) VIOLATE THE ANTITRUST LAWS. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS A JUDGMENT PERMANENTLY ENJOINING THE DEFENDANTS FROM ENFORCING THEIR ANTI-STEERING AND NON-DISCRIMINATION RULES AND CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS. THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT SEEK MONETARY DAMAGES.

THE DOJ MATTER WAS COORDINATED PRE-TRIAL WITH INDIVIDUAL AND PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS PENDING IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW

YORK AGAINST AMERICAN EXPRESS BROUGHT BY MERCHANTS ALLEGING THAT OUR ANTI-STEERING PROVISIONS IN ITS MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH THE PLAINTIFFS VIOLATE FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAWS. AS ALLEGED BY THE PLAINTIFFS, THESE PROVISIONS

PREVENT MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING CONSUMERS INCENTIVES TO USE ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF PAYMENT WHEN CONSUMERS WISH TO USE AN AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARD. PLAINTIFFS SEEK DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

IN JULY 2004, WE WERE NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED

THE MARCUS CORPORATION V. AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, ET

AL.

, IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE AN UNLAWFUL ANTITRUST TYING ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN CERTAIN OF OUR CHARGE CARDS AND CREDIT CARDS IN VIOLATION OF VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND AN

UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DAMAGES.

IN DECEMBER 2013, WE ANNOUNCED A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF THE

MARCUS

CASE AND THE

PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS CHALLENGING OUR ANTI-STEERING OR NON-DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS. THE SETTLEMENT, WHICH PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR THE PROPOSED CLASSES, RECEIVED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE FINAL APPROVAL HEARING IS SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2014.

TRIAL OF THE DOJ MATTER IS

TO COMMENCE ON JUNE 16, 2014. A TRIAL DATE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MERCHANT ACTIONS HAS NOT BEEN SET. DEFENDANTS MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN THOSE CASES ARE ALSO PENDING.

CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES TOTALING $16.2 MILLION AND PROVIDE AT LEAST $59.5 MILLION IN CUSTOMER REMEDIATION. AS NOTED ABOVE UNDER CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS AND DEPOSIT PROGRAMS  REGULATION WITHIN U.S. CARD SERVICES, IN

CONNECTION WITH REGULATORY SETTLEMENTS, ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORS AND OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEWS, WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES TO CERTAIN CARD PRACTICES AND PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO

CONTINUE TO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION TO CARD MEMBERS AND MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REGULATORY ACTIONS, WHICH COULD INCLUDE CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES.
