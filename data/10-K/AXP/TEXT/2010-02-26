COMPANY THAT PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO PRODUCTS, INSIGHTS AND EXPERIENCES THAT ENRICH LIVES AND BUILD BUSINESS SUCCESS. OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CHARGE AND CREDIT PAYMENT CARD PRODUCTS AND TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES OFFERED TO

2009 WAS A CHALLENGING YEAR CHARACTERIZED BY A WEAK ECONOMY, FROZEN CREDIT MARKETS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR AND HIGH CREDIT LOSSES

INDUSTRYWIDE. IN THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS, THE COMPANYS SPENDING AND CARDMEMBER LOAN BALANCES DECLINED BY DOUBLE DIGITS AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS IN 2008 AND CREDIT METRICS (E.G. PAST DUE AND WRITE-OFF RATES) PEAKED AT

HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER, THE COMPANYS CREDIT ACTIONS BEGAN TO POSITIVELY IMPACT PAST DUE AND WRITE-OFF RATES AND SPENDING DECLINES BEGAN TO BECOME LESS SEVERE. THE FOURTH QUARTER SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENT.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH RATE IN CARDMEMBER SPENDING VOLUMES WAS POSITIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, BENEFITING FROM BOTH EASIER COMPARISONS TO YEAR-AGO BILLINGS AS WELL AS HIGHER LEVELS OF SPENDING. IMPROVEMENTS IN BILLED BUSINESS TRENDS WERE EXPERIENCED IN ALL BUSINESS LINES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, FOR THE FIRST

TIME DURING THE YEAR, THE GROWTH RATE IN BOTH THE NUMBER OF CARD TRANSACTIONS AND AVERAGE TRANSACTION SIZE WERE POSITIVE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2008. DESPITE THESE FAVORABLE TRENDS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE

GLOBAL ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO RECOVER GRADUALLY AND THE RESULTING ENVIRONMENT TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY BILLINGS GROWTH THAT IS MORE MODEST THAN IT EXPERIENCED BEFORE THE RECESSION, AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES REMAIN CAUTIOUS ABOUT THEIR SPENDING.

OPERATING SEGMENTS, SEE PAGES 18-128 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. FOR A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND A DISCUSSION OF OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF REVENUE, SEE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK (COLLECTIVELY, CARDS). OUR CARDS PERMIT OUR CARDMEMBERS (CARDMEMBERS) TO CHARGE PURCHASES OF GOODS

AND SERVICES IN MOST COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AT THE MILLIONS OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO. WE HAVE TOTAL WORLDWIDE CARDS-IN-FORCE OF 87.9 MILLION (INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES). IN 2009, OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED

BUSINESS (SPENDING ON AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CARDS, INCLUDING CARDS ISSUED BY THIRD PARTIES) WAS $620 BILLION.

OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, ALTHOUGH TRAVEL SALES

GENERALLY TEND TO BE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS. TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES OUTSTANDING TEND TO BE GREATEST EACH YEAR IN THE SUMMER MONTHS, PEAKING IN THE THIRD QUARTER. AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

GIFT CARD SALES ARE HIGHEST IN THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER; AND CARD BILLED BUSINESS TENDS TO BE MODERATELY

HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS.

ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES

TO PUT US IN A BETTER POSITION TO GROW WITHIN OUR TRADITIONAL BUSINESSES, NEW REVENUE CATEGORIES AND EMERGING PAYMENTS, WE IMPLEMENTED A

NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES IN OCTOBER 2009. TO REALIZE THE FULL POTENTIAL OF OUR TRADITIONAL CARD AND NETWORK BUSINESSES, WE GROUPED OUR GLOBAL CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CARD-ISSUING, MERCHANT AND NETWORK BUSINESSES UNDER THE SENIOR

LEADERSHIP OF OUR VICE CHAIRMAN. THIS MOVE WILL ENABLE US TO SHARPEN OUR FOCUS ON OUR STRONGEST GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, WHILE MAINTAINING THE APPROPRIATE CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS. WE ARE ALSO CREATING AN ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP THAT WILL FOCUS

EXCLUSIVELY ON GENERATING NEW SOURCES OF FEE REVENUE FROM OUR EXISTING ASSETS AND ADVANCING OUR EFFORTS IN EMERGING PAYMENTS. THIS INCLUDES DEVELOPING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH THAT TRANSCEND INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR GROUP PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, WE CREATED A NEW GLOBAL SERVICES GROUP THAT UNITES OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CARDMEMBER SERVICING ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS MOST

PROCESSING AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS ACROSS THE COMPANY, INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT AND CERTAIN KEY PROCESSING FUNCTIONS IN AREAS SUCH AS FINANCE AND HUMAN RESOURCES. WITH THIS CHANGE TO GLOBAL SERVICES, THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZING SUPPORT

FUNCTIONS BY PROCESS RATHER THAN BUSINESS UNIT, WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS WILL STREAMLINE COSTS, REDUCE DUPLICATION OF WORK, BETTER INTEGRATE SKILLS AND EXPERTISE, AND IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. THIS ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN TASKED WITH GENERATING AN

ANNUALIZED LEVEL OF GROSS EXPENSE SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION BY 2012. IT IS EXPECTED THAT A PORTION OF ANY SUCH SAVINGS WOULD BE REINVESTED IN GROWTH INITIATIVES. ALSO, AS PART OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS

NOW WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE LEADERS OF OUR GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CARD AND GLOBAL TRAVEL SERVICES GROUPS ON OVERALL STRATEGIES TO CAPITALIZE ON BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.

SPEND-CENTRIC MODEL IS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

DESPITE THE CHALLENGES OF THE

CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, WE BELIEVE OUR SPEND-CENTRIC BUSINESS MODEL (WHICH FOCUSES ON GENERATING REVENUES PRIMARILY BY DRIVING SPENDING ON OUR CARDS AND SECONDARILY BY FINANCE CHARGES AND FEES) CONTINUES TO GIVE US SIGNIFICANT

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES, EVEN WHEN THE OVERALL SPENDING LEVEL IS DOWN. AVERAGE SPENDING ON OUR CARDS, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER ON A PER-CARD BASIS FOR US VERSUS OUR COMPETITORS, REPRESENTS GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS IN THE FORM OF LOYAL

CUSTOMERS AND HIGHER SALES. THIS ENABLES US TO EARN A PREMIUM DISCOUNT RATE AND THEREBY INVEST IN GREATER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS. AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER REVENUES GENERATED FROM HIGHER SPENDING, WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY

TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE REWARDS, OTHER INCENTIVES TO CARDMEMBERS AND TARGETED MARKETING PROGRAMS FOR MERCHANTS, WHICH IN TURN CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR CARDMEMBERS TO SPEND MORE ON THEIR CARDS. THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE MAKE IN REWARDS AND

OTHER COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITIONS FOR CARDMEMBERS DRIVES CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS. THIS BUSINESS MODEL, ALONG WITH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK, IN WHICH WE ARE BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, GIVES US A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE THAT WE SEEK TO LEVERAGE TO PROVIDE MORE VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS, MERCHANTS AND OUR CARD-ISSUING PARTNERS.

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS

BRAND

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTESTRUST, SECURITY, INTEGRITY, QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICEARE KEY ASSETS OF

THE COMPANY. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR BRAND BY EDUCATING EMPLOYEES ABOUT THESE ATTRIBUTES AND BY INCORPORATING THEM INTO OUR PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR BRAND HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN RATED ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE BRANDS IN THE WORLD IN

PUBLISHED STUDIES, AND WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS, AND WE INVEST HEAVILY IN MANAGING, MARKETING AND PROMOTING IT. IN ADDITION, WE PLACE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON TRADEMARKS,

SERVICE MARKS AND PATENTS, AND DILIGENTLY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES

THE GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT

SERVICES (GNMS) SEGMENT OPERATES A GLOBAL GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK FOR BOTH PROPRIETARY CARDS AND CARDS ISSUED UNDER THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESS. IT ALSO MANAGES MERCHANT SERVICES GLOBALLY, WHICH INCLUDES

SIGNING MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS AS WELL AS PROCESSING AND SETTLING CARD TRANSACTIONS FOR THOSE MERCHANTS. THIS SEGMENT ALSO OFFERS MERCHANTS POINT-OF-SALE, SERVICING AND SETTLEMENT AND MARKETING AND INFORMATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE ISSUED BY OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, TRS, THE COMPANYS U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES, AMERICAN EXPRESS

CENTURION BANK (CENTURION BANK) AND AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK, FSB (AEBFSB), AND BY OTHER OPERATING AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE ACCEPTED AT ALL MERCHANT LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT AMERICAN

EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, CARDS BEARING OUR LOGO ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED AT ATM LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE THAT ACCEPT CARDS. TRS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ISSUE THE MAJORITY OF CARDS ON

OUR NETWORK.

OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES (GNS) BUSINESS ESTABLISHES AND MAINTAINS RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS AND

OTHER INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ISSUE CARDS AND, IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, ACQUIRE LOCAL MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GNS IS KEY TO OUR STRATEGY OF BROADENING THE CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE.

OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES (GMS) BUSINESS PROVIDES US WITH ACCESS TO RICH TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK,

WHICH ENCOMPASSES RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH THE CARDMEMBER AND THE MERCHANT. THIS CAPABILITY HELPS US ACQUIRE NEW MERCHANTS, DEEPEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING MERCHANTS, PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, AND PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING, ANALYTICAL AND OTHER

VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO MERCHANTS IN OUR NETWORK. IN ADDITION, IT ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE TRENDS AND SPENDING PATTERNS AMONG VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE.

A KEY ASSET OF OUR NETWORK IS THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORLDS MOST HIGHLY RECOGNIZED AND RESPECTED BRANDS.

GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES

WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE A STRATEGY, THROUGH OUR GNS

BUSINESS, OF INVITING U.S. AND FOREIGN BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO ISSUE CARDS AND ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. BY LEVERAGING OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE APPEAL OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, WE BROADEN OUR CARDMEMBER

AND MERCHANT BASE FOR OUR NETWORK WORLDWIDE. THE GNS BUSINESS HAS ESTABLISHED MORE THAN 130 CARD-ISSUING AND/OR MERCHANT-ACQUIRING ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN 129 COUNTRIES.

HISTORICALLY, WE HAD SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED OUR GNS BUSINESS STRATEGY IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN CONTRAST TO

THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, UNTIL 2004, NO MAJOR U.S. BANKS HAD ISSUED CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL NETWORK. THIS SITUATION WAS THE RESULT OF RULES AND POLICIES OF VISA INC., VISA USA, AND VISA INTERNATIONAL

(COLLECTIVELY VISA) AND MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL, INC. (MASTERCARD) IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE TIME, WHICH MANDATED EXPULSION OF MEMBERS THAT ISSUED AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. THESE RULES WERE STRUCK DOWN IN 2004 IN A

LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION, BEGINNING IN 2004, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXTEND OUR NETWORK TO OTHER CARD ISSUERS IN THE UNITED STATES, JUST AS WE HAVE DONE INTERNATIONALLY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2009, GNS SIGNED 7 NEW PARTNERS TO ISSUE CARDS AND/OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THE AMERICAN

EXPRESS NETWORK. ADDITIONALLY, GNS PARTNERS LAUNCHED APPROXIMATELY 100 NEW PRODUCTS DURING 2009, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED GNS PARTNER PRODUCTS LAUNCHED TO DATE TO APPROXIMATELY 1,030.

GNS FOCUSES ON PARTNERING WITH QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT CHOOSE TO ISSUE CARDS ACCEPTED ON OUR

GLOBAL NETWORK AND/OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON OUR NETWORK. ALTHOUGH WE CUSTOMIZE OUR NETWORK ARRANGEMENTS TO THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND EACH PARTNERS REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANS IN THAT MARKETPLACE, ALL GNS ARRANGEMENTS ARE

DESIGNED TO HELP ISSUERS DEVELOP PRODUCTS FOR THEIR HIGHEST-SPENDING AND MOST AFFLUENT CUSTOMERS AND TO SUPPORT THE VALUE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MERCHANTS. WE CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT SHARE A CORE SET OF ATTRIBUTES

COMPATIBLE WITH THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND, SUCH AS COMMITMENT TO HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS AND STRONG MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND WE REQUIRE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRODUCT, BRAND AND SERVICE STANDARDS.**

WITH APPROXIMATELY 1,030 DIFFERENT CARD PRODUCTS LAUNCHED ON OUR NETWORK SO FAR BY OUR PARTNERS, GNS IS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT BUSINESS

THAT IS STRENGTHENING OUR BRAND VISIBILITY AROUND THE WORLD, DRIVING MORE TRANSACTION VOLUME ONTO OUR MERCHANT NETWORK AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD. GNS ENABLES US TO EXPAND OUR NETWORKS GLOBAL

PRESENCE GENERALLY WITHOUT ASSUMING ADDITIONAL CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK OR HAVING TO INVEST A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, AS OUR GNS PARTNERS ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED ATTRACTIVE CUSTOMER BASES THEY CAN TARGET WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED PRODUCTS, AND

ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CARDS THEY ISSUE. SINCE 1999, CARDS-IN-FORCE ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS HAVE GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 25%, AND TOTALED OVER 26 MILLION CARDS AT THE END OF 2009.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, 74% OF NEW CARDS ISSUED IN 2009 WERE CARDS ISSUED BY GNS PARTNERS. SPENDING ON GNS CARDS HAS GROWN AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL RATE OF 25% SINCE 1999. YEAR OVER YEAR SPENDING GROWTH ON THESE CARDS IN 2009 WAS 7%, WITH TOTAL

SPENDING EQUAL TO $72 BILLION.

GNS ARRANGEMENTS

ALTHOUGH THE STRUCTURES AND DETAILS OF EACH OF THE GNS ARRANGEMENTS VARY, ALL OF THEM GENERATE REVENUES FOR US FROM THE CARD TRANSACTION VOLUMES THEY DRIVE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. GROSS REVENUES

WE RECEIVE PER DOLLAR SPENT ON A CARD ISSUED BY A GNS PARTNER ARE LOWER THAN THOSE FROM OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GNS PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE OPERATING COSTS AND RISK OF ITS CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, OUR

OPERATING EXPENSES AND CREDIT LOSSES ARE LOWER THAN THOSE IN OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. THE GNS BUSINESS MODEL GENERATES AN ATTRACTIVE EARNINGS STREAM AND RISK PROFILE THAT REQUIRES A LOWER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SUPPORT. THE RETURN ON EQUITY

IN OUR GNS BUSINESS CAN THUS BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, SINCE THE MAJORITY OF GNS COSTS ARE FIXED, THE GNS BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SCALABLE. GNS PARTNERS BENEFIT FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH

THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO GAIN ATTRACTIVE REVENUE STREAMS AND EXPAND AND DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS WITH INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.

OUR GNS ARRANGEMENTS FALL INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE MAIN CATEGORIES: INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS, NETWORK CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS AND JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS.

INDEPENDENT OPERATOR ARRANGEMENTS

THE FIRST TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS AN INDEPENDENT OPERATOR (IO) ARRANGEMENT. AS OF THE END OF 2009, WE HAD 65 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO

EXPAND THE PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE DO NOT OFFER A PROPRIETARY LOCAL CURRENCY CARD. THE PARTNERS LOCAL PRESENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS HELP US ENHANCE THE IMPACT OF OUR BRAND IN THE MARKET, REACH

**

THE USE OF THE TERM PARTNER OR PARTNERING DOES NOT MEAN OR IMPLY A FORMAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP, AND IS NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY TO ALTER THE TERMS OF

AMERICAN EXPRESSS RELATIONSHIP WITH THIRD-PARTY ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MERCHANT COVERAGE GOALS MORE QUICKLY, AND OPERATE AT ECONOMIC SCALE AND COST LEVELS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACHIEVE ON OUR OWN. SUBJECT TO MEETING OUR STANDARDS, IO BANK PARTNERS ARE

LICENSED TO ISSUE LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS IN THEIR MARKETS, INCLUDING THE CLASSIC GREEN, GOLD AND PLATINUM AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF THESE PARTNERS SERVE AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND PROCESSOR FOR LOCAL MERCHANTS. AMERICAN

EXPRESS RETAINS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MULTINATIONAL MERCHANTS. OUR IO PARTNERS OWN THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIT RISK FOR THE CARDS THEY ISSUE, AND MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL BE ISSUED CARDS. GNS GENERATES REVENUES IN IO

ARRANGEMENTS FROM CARD LICENSING FEES, ROYALTIES ON CARDMEMBER BILLINGS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONVERSION REVENUE, ROYALTIES ON CHARGE VOLUME AT MERCHANTS, SHARE OF DISCOUNT REVENUE AND, IN SOME PARTNERSHIPS, ROYALTIES ON NET SPREAD REVENUE OR ROYALTIES

ON CARDS-IN-FORCE. OUR IO PARTNERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, BILLING AND PRICING, CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT SERVICING, AND FUNDING CARD RECEIVABLES FOR THEIR CARDS AND PAYABLES FOR THEIR MERCHANTS.

WE BEAR THE CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM THE IO PARTNERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK

BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH, THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY

ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON AN IO PARTNERS CREDIT RATING AND OTHER INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY REQUIRE AN IO PARTNER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS

RISK.

EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE ENTERED INTO IO ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE BRAZIL, RUSSIA, CHINA, ECUADOR, GREECE, SOUTH

KOREA, PAKISTAN, CROATIA, PERU, PORTUGAL, VIETNAM, GEORGIA AND BANGLADESH. THROUGH OUR IO PARTNERSHIPS, WE BELIEVE WE CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH IN CARDMEMBER SPENDING, CARDS-IN-FORCE AND MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE IN THESE COUNTRIES.

NETWORK CARD LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS

THE SECOND TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS KNOWN AS A NETWORK CARD LICENSE (NCL). AT THE END OF 2009, WE HAD 61 OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE WORLDWIDE. WE PURSUE THESE ARRANGEMENTS TO INCREASE

OUR BRAND PRESENCE AND GAIN MARKET SHARE IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE A PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING AND/OR MERCHANT ACQUIRING BUSINESS AND, IN A FEW CASES, THOSE IN WHICH WE HAVE IO PARTNERS. IN AN NCL ARRANGEMENT, WE GRANT THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION A LICENSE TO ISSUE AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS. THE NCL ISSUER OWNS THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS FOR ALL CARDS IT ISSUES, PROVIDES CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ITS CARDMEMBERS, AUTHORIZES TRANSACTIONS, MANAGES BILLING AND CREDIT, IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR MARKETING THE CARDS, AND DESIGNS CARD PRODUCT FEATURES (INCLUDING REWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR CARDMEMBERS), SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN STANDARDS. WE OPERATE THE MERCHANT NETWORK, ROUTE AND PROCESS CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANTS

POINT-OF-SALE THROUGH SUBMISSION TO THE ISSUER, AND SETTLE WITH ISSUERS. THE NCL IS THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED WITH BANKS IN THE UNITED STATES, UNITED KINGDOM, AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN.

GNS REVENUES IN NCL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING, ROYALTIES, CURRENCY

CONVERSIONS AND LICENSING FEES PAID BY THE PARTNER AND FEES CHARGED TO THE CARD ISSUER BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, AND OUR PROVISION OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SUCH AS CARDMEMBER INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND OTHER CARD FEATURES AND BENEFITS FOR THE ISSUERS

CARDS. AS INDICATED ABOVE, THE NCL ISSUER BEARS THE CREDIT RISK FOR THE ISSUED CARDS, AS WELL AS THE CARD MARKETING AND ACQUISITION COSTS, CARDMEMBER FRAUD RISKS AND COSTS OF REWARDS AND OTHER LOYALTY INITIATIVES. WE BEAR THE RISK ARISING FROM THE

NCL PARTNERS POTENTIAL FAILURE TO MEET ITS SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK BY PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE FINANCIALLY SOUND AND WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, AND BY MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH,

THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON AN NCL ISSUERS CREDIT RATING AND OTHER INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL HEALTH, WE MAY

REQUIRE AN NCL ISSUER TO POST A LETTER OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEE OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO REDUCE THIS RISK.

EXAMPLES OF NCL

ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANK OF AMERICA IN THE UNITED STATES, LLOYDS TSB BANK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND WESTPAC BANKING CORPORATION IN AUSTRALIA.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS

THE THIRD TYPE OF GNS ARRANGEMENT IS A JOINT VENTURE (JV) ARRANGEMENT. WE HAVE UTILIZED THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT IN SWITZERLAND

AND BELGIUM, AS WELL AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IN THESE MARKETS, WE JOIN WITH A THIRD-PARTY TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN WHICH WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP STAKE. THE JV TYPICALLY SIGNS NEW MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK AND ISSUES

LOCAL CURRENCY CARDS THAT CARRY OUR LOGO. IN A JV ARRANGEMENT, THE JV IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARDMEMBER CREDIT RISK AND BEARS THE OPERATING AND MARKETING COSTS. UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO TYPES OF GNS ARRANGEMENTS, WE SHARE MANAGEMENT, RISK, AND PROFIT

AND LOSS RESPONSIBILITY WITH OUR JV PARTNERS. INCOME IS GENERATED BY DISCOUNT REVENUES, CARD FEES AND NET SPREAD REVENUES. THE ECONOMICS OF THE JV ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, WHICH WE DISCUSS UNDER

U.S. CARD SERVICES, AND WE RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE JVS INCOME DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LEVEL OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST. OUR SUBSIDIARY, AEOCC LTD., PURCHASES CARD RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF THE GNS JVS FROM TIME

TO TIME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES

WE OPERATE A GMS BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES SIGNING MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT CARDS, ACCEPTING AND PROCESSING CARD TRANSACTIONS, AND SETTLING WITH

MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS FOR PURCHASES MADE BY CARDMEMBERS WITH CARDS (CHARGES). WE ALSO PROVIDE MARKETING, INFORMATION AND PROGRAMS TO MERCHANTS, LEVERAGING THE CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY OUR CLOSED-LOOP STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS

POINT-OF-SALE PRODUCTS AND SERVICING.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS FOR CARDMEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE CARD WHEREVER AND HOWEVER THEY

DESIRE, AND TO INCREASE MERCHANT COVERAGE IN KEY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND IN SELECTED NEW INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ACCEPTED GENERAL-PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT. WE ADD NEW MERCHANTS TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH A NUMBER

OF SALES CHANNELS: A PROPRIETARY SALES FORCE, THIRD-PARTY SALES AND SERVICE AGENTS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH BANKS AND PROCESSORS, THE INTERNET, TELEMARKETING AND INBOUND WANT TO HONOR CALLS (I.E., WHERE MERCHANTS DESIRING TO ACCEPT THE

CARD CONTACT US DIRECTLY). AS DISCUSSED IN THE GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES SECTION, OUR IO PARTNERS AND JVS ALSO ADD NEW LOCAL MERCHANTS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

DURING 2009, WE CONTINUED EXPANDING OUR INTEGRATED AMERICAN EXPRESS ONEPOINT

®

SOLUTION FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE AGENTS PROVIDE PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES TO MERCHANTS ON OUR

BEHALF FOR CARD TRANSACTIONS, WHILE WE RETAIN THE ACCEPTANCE CONTRACT WITH PARTICIPATING MERCHANTS, ESTABLISH MERCHANT PRICING AND RECEIVE THE SAME TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION WE ALWAYS HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK. THIS PROGRAM

SIMPLIFIES CARD PROCESSING FOR SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MERCHANTS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH A SINGLE SOURCE FOR STATEMENTS, SETTLEMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.

GMS CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT THE CARD. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR

EFFORTS ON INCREASING THE USE OF OUR CARDS FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING. IN 1990, 64% OF OUR U.S. BILLINGS CAME FROM THE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS AND 36% CAME FROM RETAIL AND OTHER SECTORS. THAT PROPORTION HAS NOW BEEN MORE THAN REVERSED. IN 2009,

U.S. NON-TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT BILLINGS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 71% OF THE U.S. BILLED BUSINESS ON AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS. THIS SHIFT RESULTED FROM THE GROWTH, OVER TIME, IN THE TYPES OF MERCHANTS THAT BEGAN TO ACCEPT CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS IN

RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS INCREASED DESIRE TO USE THESE CARDS FOR MORE OF THEIR PURCHASES, AND OUR FOCUS ON EXPANDING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO MEET CARDMEMBERS NEEDS.

DURING 2009, WE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO USE THE CARD FOR EVERYDAY SPENDING AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF MERCHANTS IN RETAIL AND EVERYDAY SPENDING CATEGORIES THAT ACCEPT

THE CARD, SUCH AS QUICK-SERVE RESTAURANTS, MASS TRANSIT AND RECURRING BILLING MERCHANTS. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING 2009, WE ANNOUNCED CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES WITH.



BIG LOTS



HENNES & MAURITZ (H&M)



WEIS MARKETS INC.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE SIGNED CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH.



MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS OF CANADA LIMITED, NOW ACCEPTING THE CARD AT 1,200 LOCATIONS ACROSS CANADA



AIR ASIA, ASIAS LEADING LOWFARE CARRIER



YAHOO! AUCTION, NOW ACCEPTING THE CARD IN JAPAN



PTT PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED, THE LARGEST PETROL RETAIL DISTRIBUTOR IN THAILAND, NOW ACCEPTING THE CARD AT ITS MORE THAN 900 PETROLEUM SERVICE STATIONS.

IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUED OUR DRIVE TO BRING CARD ACCEPTANCE TO INDUSTRIES WHERE CASH OR CHECKS ARE THE

PREDOMINANT FORM OF PAYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE MADE HEADWAY IN PROMOTING CARD ACCEPTANCE PAYMENTS IN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDUSTRIES SUCH AS PHARMACEUTICALS, CONSTRUCTION, INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY AND ADVERTISING. ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN 2009 IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE.



LEHIGH HANSON, ONE OF NORTH AMERICAS LARGEST SUPPLIERS OF HEAVY BUILDING MATERIALS TO THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY



PROFESSIONAL VETERINARY PRODUCTS, ONE OF THE NATIONS LARGEST ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTORS.

INTERNATIONALLY, AMONG OTHERS, A CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED WITH TRAVIS PERKINS, A LEADING BUILDERS MERCHANT AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT RETAILER HEADQUARTERED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, WITH MORE THAN 1,000 LOCATIONS.

GLOBALLY, ACCEPTANCE OF

GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS CONTINUES TO INCREASE. AS IN PRIOR YEARS, DURING 2009, WE CONTINUED TO GROW MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE OF CARDS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO REFINE OUR APPROACH TO CALCULATING MERCHANT COVERAGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES

IN THE MARKETPLACE. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT, AS OF THE END OF 2009, OUR MERCHANT NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOMMODATED MORE THAN 90% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT

NETWORK AS A WHOLE ACCOMMODATED APPROXIMATELY 80% OF OUR CARDMEMBERS GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD SPENDING. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE BASED ON COMPARING OUR CARDMEMBERS SPENDING ON OUR NETWORK CURRENTLY WITH OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT

OUR CARDMEMBERS WOULD SPEND ON OUR NETWORK IF ALL MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT GENERAL-PURPOSE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS ACCEPTED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS.

WE EARN DISCOUNT REVENUE FROM FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR ACCEPTING CARDS AS PAYMENT FOR GOODS OR SERVICES SOLD. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS THE FEE CHARGED TO THE MERCHANT FOR ACCEPTING CARDS

AND IS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE AMOUNT CHARGED ON A CARD. IN SOME INSTANCES, AN ADDITIONAL FLAT TRANSACTION FEE IS ASSESSED. THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT THAT THE MERCHANT

ACQUIRER (IN MOST CASES, TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) PAYS TO A MERCHANT FOR CHARGES SUBMITTED. A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS THE ENTITY THAT CONTRACTS FOR CARD ACCEPTANCE WITH THE MERCHANT, ACCEPTS TRANSACTIONS FROM THE MERCHANT, PAYS THE

MERCHANT FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AND SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK, WHICH SUBMITS THE TRANSACTIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE CARD ISSUER. WHEN A CARDMEMBER PRESENTS THE CARD FOR PAYMENT, THE MERCHANT CREATES A RECORD OF CHARGE FOR

THE TRANSACTION AND SUBMITS IT TO THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER FOR PAYMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT IS RECORDED BY US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE AT THE TIME THE TRANSACTION IS RECEIVED BY

US FROM THE MERCHANT.

WHERE WE ACT AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER AND THE CARD PRESENTED AT A MERCHANT IS ISSUED BY A THIRD-PARTY

BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF OUR GNS PARTNERS, WE WILL MAKE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT TO THE MERCHANT AND RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT REVENUE. IN OUR ROLE AS THE OPERATOR OF THE CARD NETWORK, WE WILL ALSO RECEIVE FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT

FROM THE CARD ISSUER, WHO RECEIVES AN ISSUER RATE (I.E., THE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AMOUNT THAT CARD ISSUERS RECEIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS CHARGED ON OUR NETWORK WITH CARDS THEY ISSUE, WHICH IS USUALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE CHARGED AMOUNT).

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISCOUNT REVENUE (RECEIVED BY US IN THE FORM OF THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT) AND THE ISSUER RATE RECEIVED BY THE CARD ISSUER GENERATES A RETURN TO US. IN CASES WHERE AMERICAN EXPRESS IS THE CARD ISSUER AND THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER

IS A THIRD-PARTY BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (WHICH CAN BE THE CASE IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH THE IO IS THE LOCAL MERCHANT ACQUIRER), WE RECEIVE AN INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED ISSUER RATE IN OUR SETTLEMENT WITH THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WHICH IS RECORDED BY

US AS DISCOUNT REVENUE. BY CONTRAST WITH NETWORKS SUCH AS VISA AND MASTERCARD, THERE IS NO COLLECTIVELY SET INTERCHANGE RATE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FOLLOWING DIAGRAMS DEPICT THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE PARTIES IN A POINT-OF-SALE

TRANSACTION EFFECTED ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK WHERE WE ACT AS BOTH THE CARD ISSUER AND MERCHANT ACQUIRER (THE 3-PARTY MODEL) AND UNDER AN NCL ARRANGEMENT WHERE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACT AS CARD ISSUERS (THE NCL

MODEL).

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT WE CHARGE IS PRINCIPALLY DETERMINED BY THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO THE MERCHANT AND

GENERALLY REPRESENTS A PREMIUM OVER OTHER NETWORKS. WE DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO MERCHANTS THROUGH HIGHER SPENDING CARDMEMBERS RELATIVE TO USERS OF CARDS ISSUED ON COMPETING CARD NETWORKS, OUR MARKETING EXPERTISE, INFORMATION AND FRAUD SERVICES, AND

CARDMEMBERS INSISTENCE ON USING THEIR CARDS WHEN ENROLLED IN REWARDS OR OTHER CARD LOYALTY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE PART OF OUR CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM.

THE MERCHANT DISCOUNT VARIES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WITH THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE MERCHANT DOES BUSINESS, THE MERCHANTS CHARGE VOLUME,

THE TIMING AND METHOD OF PAYMENT TO THE MERCHANT, THE METHOD OF SUBMISSION OF CHARGES AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF THE CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH US (LOCAL OR GLOBAL) AND THE CHARGE AMOUNT.

IN 2009, AS IN PRIOR YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SOME REDUCTION IN OUR GLOBAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE. OVER TIME, SELECTIVE

RE-PRICING INITIATIVES, CHANGES IN THE MIX OF BUSINESS AND VOLUME-RELATED PRICING DISCOUNTS LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TO RESULT IN SOME EROSION IN THE AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE.

WHILE MOST MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS UNDERSTAND OUR MERCHANT DISCOUNT PRICING IN RELATION TO THE VALUE PROVIDED, WE DO ENCOUNTER A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, BUT

TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY PREFER TO ACCEPT ANOTHER TYPE OF PAYMENT AND, CONSEQUENTLY, SUPPRESS USE OF THE CARD. SUBJECT TO LOCAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, WE RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE VIGOROUSLY TO ENSURE THAT OUR CARDMEMBERS ARE ABLE TO USE THEIR CARD

WHERE AND WHEN THEY WANT TO AND TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND. WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS LIMITING CARD SUPPRESSION BY CONCENTRATING ON ACQUIRING MERCHANTS WHERE CARDMEMBERS WANT TO USE THE CARD; CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE PROVIDE TO

MERCHANTS THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS DAILYWISH AND AMERICAN

EXPRESS SELECTS

, WHICH ENABLE MERCHANTS OF ANY SIZE TO

GAIN VALUABLE EXPOSURE AND ADDITIONAL SALES BY PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE OFFERS AND EXPERIENCES TO AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDMEMBERS; DEVELOPING AND PROVIDING NEW AND INNOVATIVE BUSINESS INSIGHTS AND FRAUD TOOLS USING INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR

CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK; PROVIDING BETTER AND EARLIER COMMUNICATION OF OUR VALUE PROPOSITION; AND, WHEN APPROPRIATE, CANCELLING MERCHANTS WHO SUPPRESS THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS THE MERCHANTS CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT TO

ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND THEREFORE WE DEDICATE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO DELIVERING VALUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR MERCHANT CUSTOMERS.

THE LAWS OF CERTAIN COUNTRIES AND MOST STATES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM SURCHARGING CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. AMERICAN EXPRESS POLICY GENERALLY DOES NOT PROHIBIT SURCHARGING

SO LONG AS IT IS PERMITTED BY LAW AND A MERCHANT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE CARD BY SURCHARGING HIGHER AMOUNTS ON PURCHASES WITH THE CARD THAN IS IMPOSED FOR PURCHASES WITH OTHER CARDS, OR BY IMPOSING A SURCHARGE ONLY ON CARD PURCHASES, BUT

NOT ON PURCHASES MADE WITH OTHER CARDS. AMERICAN EXPRESS ALSO DOES NOT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING DISCOUNTS TO CUSTOMERS WHO PAY WITH CASH OR CHECK. FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICES INFORMATION AND DOCUMENT REQUEST

REGARDING OUR POLICIES RELATING TO MERCHANT SURCHARGING AND ANTI-STEERING, PLEASE SEE OTHER MATTERS WITHIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW BEGINNING ON PAGE 87.

MERCHANT SATISFACTION IS A KEY GOAL OF OUR GMS BUSINESS. WE FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MERCHANT

SATISFACTION, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND EXECUTING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE CARD USAGE AT MERCHANTS, USING TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES, ENHANCING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND MERCHANTS EASE OF DOING BUSINESS WITH US, MAKING OUR UNITED STATES

OPERATING PROCEDURES EASILY AVAILABLE TO MERCHANTS ON OUR WEB SITE, APPLYING OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITIES AND DEEP MARKETING EXPERTISE, AND STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH MERCHANTS THROUGH AN EXPANDING ROSTER OF SERVICES THAT HELPS THEM MEET

THEIR BUSINESS GOALS.

WE ALSO OFFER OUR MERCHANT CUSTOMERS A FULL RANGE OF POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATED

POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS, SOFTWARE, ONLINE SOLUTIONS, AND DIRECT LINKS THAT ALLOW MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS (AS WELL AS CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS ISSUED ON OTHER NETWORKS AND CHECKS). VIRTUALLY ALL PROPRIETARY POINT-OF-SALE SOLUTIONS

SUPPORT DIRECT PROCESSING (I.E., DIRECT CONNECTIVITY) TO AMERICAN EXPRESS, WHICH CAN LOWER A MERCHANTS COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE AND ENHANCE PAYMENT EFFICIENCY.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR COMMITMENT TO DRIVING GLOBAL INTEROPERABILITY IN PAYMENT CARD SPECIFICATIONS, MAKING IT EASIER FOR MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT OUR CARDS, FOR CARDMEMBERS TO HAVE A MORE SEAMLESS

EXPERIENCE AT THE POINT OF SALE, AND FOR ISSUERS WHO HAVE MORE THAN ONE NETWORK RELATIONSHIP TO HAVE A STANDARD ACROSS THEIR CARD PRODUCTS. IN JANUARY 2009, WE BECAME THE FOURTH OWNER-MEMBER OF EMVCO, THE STANDARDS BODY THAT MANAGES, MAINTAINS, AND

ENHANCES SPECIFICATIONS FOR CHIP-BASED PAYMENT CARDS AND ACCEPTANCE DEVICES, INCLUDING POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS. OUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS COMPANY WILL HELP DRIVE SECURE AND INTEROPERABLE PAYMENTS GLOBALLY FOR TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH CHIP CARDS BY

ALIGNING AND PROGRESSING THE EMV SPECIFICATIONS. FURTHER, AS EMVCOS SCOPE EXPANDS TO INCLUDE EMERGING PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CONTACTLESS CARDS AND MOBILE PHONES, OUR PARTICIPATION WILL ALLOW FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SPECIFICATIONS TO

BE UNIVERSALLY COMPATIBLE AND READY FOR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN AREAS

THAT MAKE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE CARD MORE CONVENIENT FOR MERCHANTS AND CARDMEMBERS. FOR INSTANCE, EXPRESSPAY FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

, A CONTACTLESS PAYMENT FEATURE EMBEDDED IN CERTAIN CARDS, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE A FAST, EASY-TO-USE ALTERNATIVE FOR MAKING EVERYDAY PURCHASES AT MERCHANTS WHERE SPEED

AND CONVENIENCE IS IMPORTANT. IN THE U.S., TOP QUICK-SERVICE RESTAURANTS, MOVIE THEATERS, DRUG AND CONVENIENCE STORES AND MAJOR RETAIL CHAINS READILY ACCEPT PAYMENTS THROUGH EXPRESSPAY, WHICH IS POWERED BY RADIO-FREQUENCY TECHNOLOGY THAT IS

CURRENTLY EMBEDDED WITHIN SEVERAL CARD PRODUCTS. SIMILARLY, AUTOMATIC BILL PAYMENT FOCUSES ON PROVIDING CONVENIENCE BY ALLOWING MERCHANTS TO BILL CARDMEMBERS ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR RECURRING CHARGES APPROVED BY THE CARDMEMBER SUCH AS INSURANCE

PREMIUMS, NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTIONS, HEALTH CLUB MEMBERSHIPS, COMMUTATION COSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES. WE HAVE ALSO MADE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR HOST AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM TO APPROVE MORE TRANSACTIONS AND REDUCE CARDMEMBER INCONVENIENCE AT THE

POINT-OF-SALE INCLUDING ELIMINATING THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSACTIONS OF $25 OR LESS.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHEREVER WE MANAGE BOTH THE ACQUIRING RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS AND THE CARD-ISSUING SIDE

OF THE BUSINESS, THERE IS A CLOSED-LOOP, WHICH DISTINGUISHES OUR NETWORK FROM THE BANKCARD NETWORKS, IN THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CARD TRANSACTION. WE MAINTAIN DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH OUR CARDMEMBERS

AND OUR MERCHANTS, AND WE HANDLE ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. OUR RELATIONSHIPS ALLOW US TO ANALYZE INFORMATION ON CARDMEMBER SPEND. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE TARGETED MARKETING FOR MERCHANTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS TO CARDMEMBERS THROUGH A

VARIETY OF CHANNELS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS DATA, AND COMPLY WITH OUR PRIVACY AND FIREWALL POLICIES AND APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CARD-ISSUING AND MERCHANT-ACQUIRING BANK PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS CLOSED-LOOP, WHICH PERMITS THEM TO CUSTOMIZE MARKETING EFFORTS, DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO THEIR

CARDMEMBERS AND HELP US TO DIRECT INCREASED BUSINESS TO MERCHANTS WHO ACCEPT THE CARD.

AS THE MERCHANT ACQUIRER, WE HAVE

CERTAIN EXPOSURES THAT ARISE IF A BILLING DISPUTE BETWEEN A CARDMEMBER AND A MERCHANT IS SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE CARDMEMBER. DRIVERS OF THIS LIABILITY ARE RETURNS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, DISPUTES OVER FRAUDULENT CHARGES, THE QUALITY OR

NON-DELIVERY OF GOODS AND SERVICES AND BILLING ERRORS. TYPICALLY, WE OFFSET THE AMOUNT DUE TO THE CARDMEMBER AGAINST PAYMENTS FOR THE MERCHANTS CURRENT OR FUTURE CHARGE SUBMISSIONS. WE CAN REALIZE LOSSES WHEN A MERCHANTS OFFSETTING

CHARGE SUBMISSIONS CEASE, SUCH AS WHEN THE MERCHANT DECIDES TO NO LONGER ACCEPT THE CARD, COMMENCES A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR GOES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR MERCHANT BASE TO ASSESS THE RISK OF THIS EXPOSURE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE WILL

TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE TO A GIVEN MERCHANT BY HOLDING CASH RESERVES FUNDED THROUGH CHARGE PAYABLE HOLDBACKS FROM A MERCHANT, LENGTHENING THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE MERCHANT SUBMITS A CHARGE FOR PAYMENT AND WHEN WE PAY THE MERCHANT BY

REQUIRING THE MERCHANT TO SECURE A LETTER OF CREDIT OR A PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE, OR IMPLEMENTING OTHER APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS. WE ALSO ESTABLISH RESERVES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT

ACCOUNTING RULES.

WITH THE INCREASE IN ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTION DATA OVER MERCHANTS

POINT-OF-SALE SYSTEMS, AMERICAN EXPRESS AND THE OTHER MAJOR CARD NETWORKS RECOGNIZED THE NECESSITY FOR MERCHANTS AND MERCHANT PROCESSORS TO SECURE THIS DATA AGAINST ACCIDENTAL OR INTENTIONAL COMPROMISE USING A STANDARD PROTOCOL THAT APPLIES TO ALL

CARD TYPES. IN 2006, IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE SECURITY PRACTICES OF MERCHANTS AND PAYMENT PROCESSING FIRMS AND TO SECURE PAYMENT ACCOUNT DATA IN A GLOBALLY CONSISTENT MANNER, WE AND DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, JCB, MASTERCARD WORLDWIDE AND VISA

FORMED PCI SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL, LLC (PCI SSC), AN INDEPENDENT STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION. PCI SSCS ROLE IS TO MANAGE THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY (PCI) DATA SECURITY STANDARD, AND MORE RECENTLY THE PCI PIN ENTRY DEVICE

(PED) SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AND THE PAYMENT APPLICATION DATA SECURITY STANDARD, WHICH FOCUS ON IMPROVING PAYMENT CARD ACCOUNT SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE TRANSACTION PROCESS. BY ESTABLISHING PCI SSC, WE AND THE OTHER FOUNDERS HAVE DEVELOPED COMMON

STANDARDS THAT ARE MORE ACCESSIBLE AND EFFICIENT FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY. ALL OUR MERCHANTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT STORE, PROCESS AND TRANSMIT PAYMENT CARD DATA ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD.

PCI SSC IS DEDICATED TO DRIVING GREATER EDUCATION, AWARENESS AND ADOPTION OF THESE SECURITY STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THE PAYMENT PROCESS CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY.

IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA, THIRD-PARTY PROCESSORS AND SOME BANKCARD ACQUIRERS HAVE BEGUN TO OFFER

MERCHANTS THE CAPABILITY OF CONVERTING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE CURRENCY OF THE CARDHOLDERS RESIDENCE (I.E., THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY) AT THE POINT-OF-SALE, AND SUBMITTING THE TRANSACTION IN THE

CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY, THUS BYPASSING THE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCESS OF THE CARD NETWORK. THIS PRACTICE IS KNOWN AS DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION. IF A MERCHANT UTILIZES A DYNAMIC CURRENCY CONVERSION

PROCESS, THE MERCHANT AND PROCESSOR SHARE ANY FEE ASSESSED OR SPREAD EARNED FOR CONVERTING THE TRANSACTION AT THE POINT-OF-SALE, THUS REDUCING OR ELIMINATING REVENUE FOR CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS RELATING TO THE CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CHARGES TO

THE CARDHOLDERS BILLING CURRENCY. THIS PRACTICE IS NOT WIDESPREAD, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT CONSUMERS WILL PREFER TO HAVE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS CONVERTED BY MERCHANTS IN THIS WAY. OUR POLICY GENERALLY REQUIRES MERCHANTS TO

SUBMIT CHARGES AND BE PAID IN THE CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION OCCURS, AND WE CONVERT THE TRANSACTION TO THE CARDMEMBERS BILLING CURRENCY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICESCOMPETITION

OUR GLOBAL CARD NETWORK, INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES AND GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES BUSINESSES, COMPETES WITH OTHER CHARGE AND CREDIT

CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, VISA, MASTERCARD, DINERS CLUB INTERNATIONAL (WHICH WAS ACQUIRED BY DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES), DISCOVER (PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES), AND JCB CO., LTD. (PRIMARILY IN ASIA). WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST

GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST MARKETS. IN ADDITION, APART FROM SUCH NETWORK SERVICES, A RANGE OF COMPANIES GLOBALLY, INCLUDING MERCHANT

ACQUIRERS AND PROCESSORS, CARRY OUT SOME ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE PERFORMED BY OUR GMS AND GNS BUSINESSES. NO SINGLE ENTITY PARTICIPATES ON A GLOBAL BASIS IN THE FULL RANGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ENCOMPASSED BY OUR CLOSED-LOOP BUSINESS MODEL.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE NETWORK AND MERCHANT SERVICE BUSINESSES INCLUDE.



THE NUMBER OF CARDS-IN-FORCE AND AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON THESE CARDS



THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THE CARDS CAN BE USED



THE ECONOMIC ATTRACTIVENESS TO CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS OF PARTICIPATING IN THE NETWORK



THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS



REPUTATION AND BRAND RECOGNITION



INNOVATION IN SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PARTICULARLY IN ON-LINE COMMERCE



THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE



THE SECURITY OF CARDMEMBER AND MERCHANT INFORMATION



THE IMPACT OF EXISTING LITIGATION, LEGISLATION AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION



THE COST OF CARD ACCEPTANCE RELATIVE TO THE VALUE PROVIDED.

ANOTHER ASPECT OF NETWORK COMPETITION IS THE RECENT EMERGENCE AND RAPID GROWTH OF ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDE

AGGREGATORS (SUCH AS PAYPAL), WIRELESS PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING USING MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORKS TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS), PREPAID SYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS LINKED TO CREDIT CARDS, AND BANK TRANSFER MODELS. TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, SUCH AS AGGREGATORS, CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND IN THE ONLINE PAYMENTS SPACE, OUR MERCHANT REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN THE UNITED

STATES, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT VEHICLES CONTINUE TO EMERGE THAT SEEK TO REDIRECT ONLINE CUSTOMERS TO PAYMENT SYSTEMS BASED ON ACH (AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE, I.E., INTER-BANK TRANSFER), AND EXISTING DEBIT NETWORKS ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ONLINE

PIN FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE RELATIVE USE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ONLINE. FOR A DISCUSSION CONCERNING OUR RECENT ACQUISITION OF REVOLUTION MONEY INC. IN THE EMERGING PAYMENTS AREA, PLEASE SEE ENTERPRISE GROWTH

BEGINNING ON PAGE 34 BELOW.

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE OUR CLOSED-LOOP STRUCTURE, SUCH AS VISA,

WITH ITS VISA INCENTIVE NETWORK. ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE VISA WILL BE, EFFORTS BY VISA AND OTHER CARD NETWORKS AND PAYMENT PROVIDERS TO REPLICATE THE CLOSED-LOOP SPEAK TO ITS CONTINUED VALUE AND TO THE INTENSE COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICESREGULATION

LOCAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING GNS ARRANGEMENTS WITH

BANKS AND QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BECAUSE SUCH BANKS AND INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY ARE ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CARDS AND, IN THE CASE OF OUR IO ARRANGEMENTS, TO OPERATE MERCHANT-ACQUIRING BUSINESSES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR GNS

PARTNERS HAVE GENERALLY NOT HAD DIFFICULTY OBTAINING APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE CHOSEN TO ENTER INTO GNS ARRANGEMENTS. AS A NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDER TO REGULATED U.S. BANKS, OUR GNS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO

REVIEW

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BY CERTAIN FEDERAL BANK REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC), THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND THE OFFICE OF

THRIFT SUPERVISION. AS THE OPERATOR OF A GENERAL-PURPOSE CARD NETWORK, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENCY AND FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS REPORTING ACT AND THE ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

(COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE BANK SECRECY ACT), AS AMENDED BY THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001 (THE PATRIOT ACT). WE CONDUCT DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR GNS PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) CONTROLS TO PREVENT OUR NETWORK FROM BEING USED FOR MONEY LAUNDERING OR TERRORIST FINANCING PURPOSES. AS A RESULT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS EACH BECOMING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO

SUBJECT TO FURTHER REGULATION AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHANGE IN REGULATORY STATUS, PLEASE SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONGENERAL BEGINNING ON PAGE 35 BELOW.

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION

OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS AND THE FEES MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND, ITALY, SWITZERLAND, GERMANY, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU),

AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING OR ON APPEAL.

THE

INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD, IS GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE

CHARGE PAYABLE BY MERCHANTS FOR BANKCARD DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS.

BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE COLLECTIVELY SET INTERCHANGE FEES. ALTHOUGH THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON

VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS AND THEIR OPERATIONS ON A MULTILATERAL BASIS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE BANKCARD ASSOCIATIONS PRICING COULD ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR

MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE FROM CONSUMERS SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE ANTITRUST ACTIONS OR REGULATIONS HAVE LED OUR COMPETITORS TO LOWER THEIR FEES, WE HAVE MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR

PRICING TO MERCHANTS TO REFLECT LOCAL COMPETITIVE TRENDS. FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCTIONS IN BANKCARD INTERCHANGE MANDATED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA REFORMS IN 2003 HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR VISA AND MASTERCARD ACCEPTANCE. AS

A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, WE HAVE REDUCED OUR OWN MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES IN AUSTRALIA, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE BILLED BUSINESS AND THE NUMBER OF MERCHANTS ACCEPTING OUR CARDS. IN ADDITION, UNDER LEGISLATION ENACTED IN

ARGENTINA, A MERCHANT ACQUIRER IS REQUIRED TO CHARGE THE SAME MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE TO ALL MERCHANTS IN THE SAME INDUSTRY CATEGORY, AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES FOR CREDIT CARDS CANNOT EXCEED 3%. THE CENTRAL BANK OF VENEZUELA HAS ISSUED REGULATIONS

REGARDING THE MAXIMUM LEVEL OF MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES BY INDUSTRY CATEGORY. IN HUNGARY, RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION WILL REQUIRE POINT-OF-SALE SERVICE CHARGES NOT TO EXCEED 2%.

IN EUROPE, INVESTIGATIONS OF INTERCHANGE ARE USUALLY HANDLED BY THE DOMESTIC COMPETITION LAW AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION. IN ITS FINAL REPORT ON THE RETAIL BANKING SECTOR ISSUED IN JANUARY 2007, WHICH INCLUDED A REVIEW OF THE PAYMENT CARDS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION APPEARED TO FAVOR COMPETITION LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOLS,

RATHER THAN REGULATION OF PRICE LEVELS, TO ADDRESS PERCEIVED COMPETITION ISSUES. THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN ITS FINAL REPORT DO NOT HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW, BUT MAY BE USED AS THE BASIS FOR FUTURE REGULATION OR ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT

ACTION IN THE EU MEMBER STATES.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RULED THAT MASTERCARDS MULTILATERAL

INTERCHANGE FEES (MIF) FOR CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTIONS VIOLATE EC TREATY RULES ON RESTRICTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. THE COMMISSIONS DECISION APPLIES TO CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER CREDIT, CHARGE AND DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS

WITHIN THE EU AND TO DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH MASTERCARD HAS CHOSEN TO APPLY THE CROSS-BORDER MIF. THE RULING DOES NOT PREVENT MASTERCARD AND ITS MEMBER BANKS FROM ADOPTING AN ALTERNATIVE MIF ARRANGEMENT THAT CAN BE PROVEN TO COMPLY WITH EU

COMPETITION RULES. ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION INCLUDED COMMERCIAL CARDS, IT HAS

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESERVED JUDGMENT FOR THE TIME BEING ON THE LEGALITY OF MASTERCARDS CROSS-BORDER MIF FOR COMMERCIAL CARD TRANSACTIONS. MASTERCARD LODGED AN APPEAL AGAINST THE COMMISSIONS FINDINGS,

WHICH IS PENDING. AN INTERIM SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN AGREED TO BETWEEN THE COMMISSION AND MASTERCARD, CAPPING MIF AT 30 BASIS POINTS FOR CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS AND 20 BASIS POINTS FOR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS.

IN 2002, THE COMMISSION GRANTED AN EXEMPTION TO VISA REGARDING ITS MIFS. THIS EXEMPTION EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND IN MARCH 2008

THE COMMISSION OPENED FORMAL ANTITRUST PROCEEDINGS AGAINST VISA EUROPE LIMITED IN RELATION TO VISAS MIFS FOR CROSS-BORDER CONSUMER CARD TRANSACTIONS. THE COMMISSION HAS INDICATED THAT THE MASTERCARD DECISION SHOULD PROVIDE VISA WITH

GUIDANCE FOR THE WAY AHEAD, ALTHOUGH IT STATED THAT EVERY MIF MUST BE EXAMINED ON ITS OWN MERITS.

THESE

DEVELOPMENTS MAY AFFECT HOW THE COMPETITION AUTHORITIES IN THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EU VIEW DOMESTIC INTERCHANGE. IN 2007, FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPETITION REGULATOR IN POLAND FOUND INSUFFICIENT BASIS FOR VISA AND MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE FEES AND ORDERED

THE ASSOCIATIONS AND THEIR MEMBERS TO STOP THEIR CURRENT INTERCHANGE SETTING PRACTICES IMMEDIATELY. THE BANKS APPEALED THAT DECISION, AND IN NOVEMBER 2008 THE DECISION WAS OVERTURNED. THE POLISH COMPETITION AUTHORITY HAS APPEALED THAT RULING.

IN AUGUST 2009, VISA AND MASTERCARD SETTLED AN ANTI-TRUST CASE WITH THE NEW ZEALAND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES REGARDING WHETHER

THE SETTING OF INTERCHANGE RATES CONSTITUTED PRICE FIXING AND WHETHER OTHER SCHEME RULES LESSENED COMPETITION. THE SETTLEMENT RESULTS IN CHANGES TO THE VISA AND MASTERCARD SCHEME RULES, WHICH WILL SET MAXIMUM INTERCHANGE RATES AND ALSO ALLOW

BILATERAL SETTING OF LOWER INTERCHANGE RATES BETWEEN ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS, AS WELL AS REMOVE THE SCHEMES NO SURCHARGING RULES. THE FULL EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES TO INTERCHANGE ON OUR DISCOUNT RATE IN NEW ZEALAND IS NOT LIKELY TO BE

KNOWN UNTIL THE SCHEMES PUBLISH THEIR MAXIMUM INTERCHANGE RATES ON APRIL 17, 2010.

REGULATORS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED THE

INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF PROHIBITING MERCHANTS FROM PASSING THE COST OF MERCHANT DISCOUNT FEES ALONG TO CONSUMERS THROUGH SURCHARGES ON CARD PURCHASES. IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE SEEN SELECTIVE, BUT INCREASING, MERCHANT SURCHARGING ON OUR CARDS IN CERTAIN

INDUSTRIES AND, IN SOME CASES, ON A BASIS THAT IS GREATER THAN THAT APPLIED TO CARDS ISSUED ON THE BANKCARD NETWORKS. THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ADOPTED A NEW LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS, REFERRED TO AS THE

PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE. THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE PRESCRIBES COMMON RULES FOR LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE

PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE IS TO FACILITATE THE CREATION OF A SINGLE, INTERNAL PAYMENTS MARKET IN THE EU THROUGH HARMONIZATION OF EU MEMBER STATE LAWS GOVERNING PAYMENT SERVICES. ONE PROVISION OF THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE PERMITS MERCHANTS TO

SURCHARGE, SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, BUT ALSO ALLOWS INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES TO OVERRIDE THIS RULE BY PROHIBITING OR LIMITING SURCHARGING. TO DATE, THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS DECIDED TO PERMIT SURCHARGING (AND THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS FOR A

NUMBER OF YEARS PERMITTED MERCHANTS TO LEVY A SURCHARGE ON CREDIT CARD PURCHASES). THERE ARE VARIED APPROACHES IN MOST OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE SOME PROHIBIT SURCHARGING, OTHERS ALLOW SURCHARGING, AND STILL OTHERS ALLOW SURCHARGING BUT LIMIT IT

IN SOME WAY, SUCH AS BY CAPPING THE SURCHARGE ALLOWED OR LIMITING THE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS WHERE SURCHARGING IS PERMITTED. ALL MEMBER STATES PERMIT OR PROPOSE TO PERMIT DISCOUNTS. THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE COMPLEMENTS ANOTHER EUROPEAN

INITIATIVE, THE SINGLE EURO PAYMENTS AREA (SEPA), WHICH IS AN INDUSTRY-LED INITIATIVE WITH SUPPORT FROM EU INSTITUTIONS. AMONG OTHER CHANGES, SEPA WILL INVOLVE THE ADOPTION OF NEW, PAN-EUROPEAN TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR CARDS AND CARD

TRANSACTIONS. ALL OF THE FOREGOING REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN.

IN THE UNITED STATES, CONGRESS

CONTINUES TO DEBATE THE INTERCHANGE ISSUE. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HEARINGS ON VISA/MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND IN 2009 AT THE REQUEST OF CONGRESS, THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE (GAO) COMPLETED A STUDY ON THE

STRUCTURE OF INTERCHANGE FEES AND THEIR IMPACT ON CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS. THE REPORT PROVIDES A BALANCED VIEW OF THE INTERCHANGE ISSUE AND EXPLAINS HOW LARGE MERCHANTS WOULD BENEFIT AND HOW CONSUMERS COULD BE HARMED BY THE PENDING LEGISLATIVE

PROPOSALS. IN 2009, LEGISLATION WAS REINTRODUCED IN CONGRESS THAT WOULD GIVE ALL U.S. MERCHANTS ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO NEGOTIATE

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COLLECTIVELY THE PRICE AND TERMS OF CARD ACCEPTANCE ON NETWORKS. THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BILL COVERS NETWORKS WITH AT LEAST A 20% SHARE OF U.S. CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD PAYMENTS COMBINED,

WHICH WOULD NOT APPLY TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK BUT, IF ENACTED, WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON AMERICAN EXPRESS IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE SENATE VERSION OF THE BILL COVERS NETWORKS WITH AT LEAST 10% OF U.S. CREDIT OR DEBIT PAYMENTS, WHICH WOULD APPLY

TO AMERICAN EXPRESS. BOTH BILLS HAVE A DEFAULT PROCESS FOR HAVING PRICES AND TERMS SET THROUGH GOVERNMENT ACTION RATHER THAN COMPETITIVE FORCES. A SIMILAR VERSION OF THE HOUSE BILL (THE CREDIT CARD FAIR FEE ACT) WAS PASSED IN THE HOUSE

JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN 2008. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN ON EITHER OF THESE BILLS IN 2009. THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE HELD A HEARING ON A THIRD PIECE OF INTERCHANGE-RELATED LEGISLATION THAT WAS REINTRODUCED IN 2009 (THE CREDIT CARD

INTERCHANGE FEES ACT), A BILL THAT WOULD REGULATE PAYMENT NETWORK RULES, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN ON THIS BILL. IT IS EXPECTED THAT CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS WILL CONTINUE IN 2010 ON THE INTERCHANGE

ISSUE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS ON INTERCHANGE AND HAVE HELD SEVERAL CONFERENCES FOCUSED ON INTERCHANGE RATES. WHILE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN MONITORING THIS ISSUE,

IT HAS NOT INDICATED THE NEED TO REGULATE INTERCHANGE RATES IN THE UNITED STATES.

DURING THE LAST THREE YEARS, THERE WERE

ALSO A NUMBER OF BILLS PROPOSED IN INDIVIDUAL STATE LEGISLATURES SEEKING TO IMPOSE CAPS ON CREDIT CARD INTERCHANGE OR TO PROHIBIT CARD COMPANIES FROM CHARGING MERCHANT DISCOUNT ON THE SALES TAX PORTION OF CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. OTHER PROPOSALS WERE

AIMED AT INCREASING THE TRANSPARENCY OF CARD NETWORK RULES FOR MERCHANTS. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF BILLS WERE PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH MERCHANT LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS OF A DATA SECURITY BREACH OF A MERCHANTS SYSTEM OR REQUIRE MERCHANTS TO ADOPT

TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT SENSITIVE CARD HOLDER PAYMENT INFORMATION. PROPOSED STATE LEGISLATION AIMED AT REGULATING PRICING OR OTHER ASPECTS OF MERCHANTS CARD ACCEPTANCE WILL CONTINUE DURING 2010. IN THE EVENT THAT GOVERNMENTAL OR

REGULATORY ACTIVITY TO LIMIT INTERCHANGE OR MERCHANT FEES CONTINUES OR INCREASES, OR STATE DATA SECURITY LEGISLATION IS ADOPTED, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AS REGULATORY INTEREST IN CREDIT

CARD NETWORK PRICING TO MERCHANTS AND RELATED ISSUES HAS INCREASED, THE COMPANY HAS RESPONDED TO MANY INQUIRIES FROM BANKING AND COMPETITION AUTHORITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ONGOING RESPONSE TO A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND

FROM THE ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, PLEASE SEE OTHER MATTERS WITHIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW.

U.S. CARD SERVICES

AS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR

PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS, OUR U.S. BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ISSUE A WIDE RANGE OF CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR CONSUMER TRAVEL BUSINESS, WHICH PROVIDES TRAVEL

WE HAVE TWO U.S. BANK SUBSIDIARIES, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, WHICH ARE WHOLLY

SINCE JANUARY 2009, AEBFSB HAS COMMITTED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO OF NO LESS THAN 15%.

CHARGE CARDS

OUR CHARGE

CARDS, WHICH GENERALLY CARRY NO PRESET SPENDING LIMITS, ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES. CHARGES ARE APPROVED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING A CARDMEMBERS

CURRENT SPENDING PATTERNS, PAYMENT HISTORY, CREDIT RECORD, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. CARDMEMBERS GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH, AND NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED ON THE BALANCE. CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS THAT ARE PAST DUE ARE

SUBJECT, IN MOST CASES, TO A DELINQUENCY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSESSMENT AND, IF NOT BROUGHT TO CURRENT STATUS, MAY BE CANCELLED. THE NO PRESET SPENDING LIMIT AND PAY-IN-FULL NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS ATTRACT HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS WHO WANT TO USE A

CHARGE CARD TO FACILITATE LARGER PAYMENTS.

THE CHARGE CARDS ALSO OFFER FLEXIBLE PAYMENT FEATURES TO

CARDMEMBERS. THE SIGN & TRAVEL

®

PROGRAM GIVES QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDED

PAYMENTS FOR AIRLINE, CRUISE AND CERTAIN TRAVEL CHARGES THAT ARE PURCHASED WITH OUR CHARGE CARDS. THE EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION OFFERS QUALIFIED U.S. CARDMEMBERS THE OPTION OF EXTENDING PAYMENT FOR CERTAIN CHARGES ON THE CHARGE CARD IN EXCESS OF A

SPECIFIED AMOUNT.

IN 2009, WE LAUNCHED TWO NEW CARD PRODUCTS TO THE CHARGE CARD PORTFOLIO. PREMIER

REWARDS GOLD LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER, TARGETING HIGH-SPENDING, FREQUENT TRAVELERS WHO WANT TO MAXIMIZE REWARDS. THIS CARD OFFERS TRIPLE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

®

POINTS ON AIRFARE PURCHASES, DOUBLE POINTS ON GAS AND GROCERY AND SINGLE POINTS ON ALL OTHER SPEND. IN ADDITION, CARDMEMBERS RECEIVE 15,000 BONUS POINTS WHEN THEY

SPEND $30,000 IN A YEAR. IN NOVEMBER, WE PILOTED ZYNC

SM

CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, A NEW CHARGE CARD FOR A YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC WITH A LOW ANNUAL FEE OF $25. CARDMEMBERS GET CORE CHARGE CARD FEATURES AND PROTECTIONS ON THE BASE CARD, AND HAVE THE OPTION OF PURCHASING PACKS WITH

SPECIALIZED LIFESTYLE-BASED FEATURES AND BENEFITS.

DURING 2009, WE LAUNCHED THE DONT TAKE

CHANCES, TAKE CHARGE

SM

 MARKETING CAMPAIGN, WHICH

HIGHLIGHTS THE BENEFITS OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARD. THE CAMPAIGN IS PART OF AN ONGOING EFFORT TO INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT THE CHARGE CARD AND ILLUSTRATES HOW IT CAN HELP CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY DURING DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES. OUR CHARGE CARD

PRODUCTS HAVE GLOBAL BREADTH, HIGH AVERAGE SPEND, LOWER LOSSES AND ANNUAL CARD FEES. IN ADDITION, AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE AND VALUE, CHARGE CARDS, BEING A PAY-IN-FULL PRODUCT, ALLOW CONSUMERS AND COMPANIES TO

CONTROL THEIR DEBT.

IN ANOTHER EFFORT TO HELP CARDMEMBERS ACHIEVE FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT, WE LAUNCHED THE

ONLINE MONEY MANAGER, WHERE CARDMEMBERS CAN TRACK SPEND ACROSS ALL OF THEIR FINANCIAL ACCOUNTSNOT JUST AMERICAN EXPRESS. CARDMEMBERS CAN SET BUDGETS BY CATEGORY AND RECEIVE ALERTS TO KEEP THEM APPRISED OF THEIR SPENDING VERSUS THEIR BUDGET. WE

ALSO ANNOUNCED A UNIQUE, NEW SERVICE THAT HELPS AMERICAN EXPRESS

®

CHARGE CARDMEMBERS TO SET, MANAGE, AND TRACK

SPENDING LIMITS ON ADDITIONAL CARDS ON THEIR ACCOUNT, WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE WHO IS 15 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER.

REVOLVING CREDIT

CARDS

WE OFFER A VARIETY OF REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS. THESE CARDS HAVE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT PAYMENT TERMS, INTEREST RATE AND

FEE STRUCTURES, REWARDS PROGRAMS AND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. REVOLVING CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, BLUE CASH FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND BLUE SKY FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, PROVIDE CARD MEMBERS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO PAY THEIR

BILL IN FULL EACH MONTH OR CARRY A MONTHLY BALANCE ON THEIR CARDS TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES. ALONG WITH CHARGE CARDS AND CO-BRAND CARDS, THESE REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS ATTRACT AFFLUENT CARDMEMBERS AND PROMOTE INCREASED RELEVANCE FOR

OUR EXPANDING MERCHANT NETWORK. OUR NON-CO-BRAND PROPRIETARY LENDING PRODUCTS REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 13% OF OUR US CARD SERVICES BILLINGS. AS WE CONTINUE TO SCALE BACK ON THESE CARDS AND TARGET PREMIUM CHARGE CARD AND CO-BRAND CARD PRODUCTS, THE

COMPANYS PRIORITY WILL BE TO DRIVE BILLED BUSINESS AND AVERAGE SPEND PER CARD RATHER THAN ACHIEVE BROAD GROWTH IN CARDS-IN-FORCE.

CO-BRAND CARDS

WE ISSUE CARDS UNDER CO-BRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE COMPETITION AMONG CARD ISSUERS AND NETWORKS FOR ATTRACTIVE CO-BRAND CARD PARTNERSHIPS IS QUITE INTENSE BECAUSE THESE PARTNERSHIPS CAN GENERATE HIGH-SPENDING LOYAL CARDHOLDERS. THE DURATION OF OUR CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM FIVE

TO TEN YEARS. CARDMEMBERS EARN REWARDS PROVIDED BY THE PARTNERS RESPECTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS BASED UPON THEIR SPENDING ON THE CO-BRAND CARDS, SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES, HOTEL LOYALTY POINTS AND CASH BACK. WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR CO-BRAND

PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. WE EXPENSE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER

CO-BRAND ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MONTH EARNED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY ARRANGEMENT, BUT ARE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY. GENERALLY, ONCE WE MAKE

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PAYMENT TO THE CO-BRAND PARTNER, THE PARTNER IS SOLELY LIABLE FOR PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE CO-BRAND PARTNERS OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM. AS THE ISSUER OF THE CO-BRAND CARD, WE

RETAIN ALL THE CREDIT RISK WITH THE CARDMEMBER AND BEAR THE RECEIVABLES FUNDING AND OPERATING EXPENSES FOR SUCH CARDS. THE CO-BRAND PARTNER RETAINS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE MILES, POINTS OR OTHER CURRENCY EARNED BY THE CARDMEMBER UNDER THE

PARTNERS LOYALTY PROGRAM.

DURING 2009, WE EXTENDED OUR EXCLUSIVE U.S. CO-BRAND PARTNERSHIP WITH

STARWOOD HOTEL AND RESORTS WORLDWIDE, INC. AND JETBLUE FOR A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD, ALLOWING FOR THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAMS AND PROVIDING ATTRACTIVE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS BENEFITS FOR BOTH COMPANIES. WE ALSO UNVEILED A NUMBER OF NEW

BENEFITS AVAILABLE ON OUR DELTA SKYMILES CREDIT CARDS THAT ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO EARN AND REDEEM MILES IN MORE WAYS AND PLACES, ON BOTH DELTA AND NORTHWEST-OPERATED FLIGHTS. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW PREMIUM CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARD CALLED

THE HILTON HHONORS SURPASS

®

CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS, WITH SEVERAL ENHANCEMENTS TO THE EXISTING HILTON

HHONORS

®

CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS.

CO-BRAND PARTNERSHIPS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS

WE ALSO ISSUE

CARDS THAT ARE MARKETED UNDER CO-BRAND PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNERS. SUCH PARTNERSHIPS INVOLVE THE OFFERING OF A STANDARD PRODUCT (ISSUED BY TRS OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) TO CUSTOMERS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNER,

GENERALLY CO-BRANDED WITH THE PARTNERS NAME ON THE CARD. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED THROUGH THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE

AMOUNT OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING ON SUCH CARDS. THE DURATION OF SUCH ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY RANGES FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.

CARD PRICING

AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

CERTAIN CARDS, PARTICULARLY CHARGE CARDS, CHARGE AN ANNUAL FEE THAT VARIES BASED ON THE TYPE OF

CARD AND THE NUMBER OF CARDS FOR EACH ACCOUNT. WE ALSO OFFER MANY REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS WITH NO ANNUAL FEE BUT ON WHICH WE ASSESS FINANCE CHARGES FOR REVOLVING BALANCES. DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT, WE ALSO CHARGE CARDMEMBERS AN ANNUAL PROGRAM FEE TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAMS AND FEES FOR ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE (E.G., LATE FEES) OR FOR CERTAIN SERVICES (E.G., ADDITIONAL COPIES OF ACCOUNT STATEMENTS). WE APPLY STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR CREDITWORTHINESS TO EACH CARDMEMBER

THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS BOTH AT THE TIME OF INITIAL SOLICITATION OR APPLICATION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING THE CARD RELATIONSHIP. WE USE SOPHISTICATED CREDIT MODELS AND TECHNIQUES IN OUR RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION

OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES, PLEASE SEE RISK MANAGEMENT APPEARING ON PAGE 47 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

PROGRAM

THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM

FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS OVER 1,600 REDEMPTION PARTNERS WORLDWIDE. THE PROGRAM ALLOWS CARDMEMBERS TO EARN ONE POINT FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY DOLLAR CHARGED ON ELIGIBLE, ENROLLED AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, AND THEN REDEEM POINTS FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF REWARDS,

INCLUDING TRAVEL, RETAIL MERCHANDISE, DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND EVEN DONATIONS TO BENEFIT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHARITIES. POINTS GENERALLY HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE AND THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF POINTS ONE CAN EARN. A

LARGE MAJORITY OF SPENDING BY ELIGIBLE CARDMEMBERS EARNS POINTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

THE U.S. MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM HAS OVER 150 REDEMPTION PARTNERS AND FEATURES OVER 500 MERCHANDISE BRANDS. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS ARE ALIGNED WITH SPECIFIC CARD PRODUCTS TO BETTER MEET CARDMEMBER LIFESTYLE AND REWARD PROGRAM USAGE NEEDS. AMERICAN EXPRESS

CARDMEMBERS PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THREE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM TIERS BASED ON THE CREDIT OR CHARGE CARD THEY HAVE IN THEIR WALLET. FOR THOSE CARDMEMBERS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS, SUCH AS BLUE FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ZYNC FROM AMERICAN

INNOVATIONS TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

WE ENHANCED OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS

®

PROGRAM WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW REWARD OPTIONS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CARDMEMBERS WITH GREATER BREADTH AND VARIETY

AS WELL AS UTILITY. SPECIFICALLY, THESE INCLUDED: PROVIDING CARDMEMBERS THE ABILITY TO DESIGNATE THEIR POINTS AS PAYMENT FOR EVERYDAY CHARGES WITHIN THEIR ONLINE STATEMENT; THE LAUNCH OF THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS SPECIALS PROGRAM FEATURING

SPECIALS FOR POPULAR REWARD OPTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONICS AND TRAVEL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; AND THE ADDITION OF A NUMBER OF NEW PARTNERS, SUCH AS ZAPPOS.COM AND BRITISH AIRWAYS, WHICH GIVE CARDMEMBERS A BROADER RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO REDEEM

POINTS WITH CASUAL DINING RESTAURANTS, RETAILERS AND AIRLINES.

WHEN A CARDMEMBER ENROLLED IN THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM

USES THE CARD, WE ESTABLISH RESERVES TO COVER THE COST OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REWARD REDEMPTIONS FOR POINTS EARNED TO DATE. WHEN A MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ENROLLEE REDEEMS A REWARD USING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS, WE MAKE A PAYMENT TO THE MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS PROGRAM PARTNER PROVIDING THE REWARD PURSUANT TO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. MEMBERSHIP REWARDS EXPENSE IS DRIVEN BY CARDMEMBER CHARGE VOLUME, CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM, AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH REDEMPTION PARTNERS. AT

YEAR END, WE ESTIMATED THAT CURRENT CARDMEMBERS WILL REDEEM APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THEIR POINTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESRESERVES FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS COSTS APPEARING

ON PAGE 24 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

MEMBERSHIP

REWARDS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER SPENDING AND LOYALTY. WE BELIEVE, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THAT CARDMEMBERS ENROLLED IN REWARDS PROGRAMS YIELD HIGHER SPEND, STRONGER CREDIT PERFORMANCE AND GREATER PROFIT FOR US. BY

OFFERING A BROADER RANGE OF REDEMPTION CHOICES, WE HAVE GIVEN OUR CARDMEMBERS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE OF THEIR REWARDS POINTS AND FAVORABLY AFFECTED OUR AVERAGE COST PER POINT. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO OPTIMIZE THE OVERALL ECONOMICS OF THE PROGRAM

AND MAKE CHANGES TO ENHANCE ITS VALUE TO CARDMEMBERS. OUR PROGRAM IS ALSO VALUABLE TO MERCHANTS THAT BECOME REDEMPTION PARTNERS AS WE BRING THEM HIGH-SPENDING CARDMEMBERS AND NEW MARKETING CHANNELS TO REACH THESE CARDMEMBERS.

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESSCOMPETITION

OUR PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS ENCOUNTERS SUBSTANTIAL AND INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. AS A CARD ISSUER, WE

COMPETE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SUCH AS CITIBANK, BANK OF AMERICA, JPMORGAN CHASE, AND CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL) THAT ISSUE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND REVOLVING CREDIT CARDS, AND DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHICH ISSUES THE

DISCOVER CARD ON THE DISCOVER BUSINESS SERVICES NETWORK. WE ALSO ENCOUNTER LIMITED COMPETITION FROM BUSINESSES THAT ISSUE THEIR OWN CARDS OR OTHERWISE EXTEND CREDIT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS RETAILERS AND AIRLINE ASSOCIATIONS, ALTHOUGH THESE CARDS

ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ONLY AT LIMITED LOCATIONS. BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

ISSUERS. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG ALL ISSUERS REMAINS INTENSE.

COMPETING CARD ISSUERS OFFER A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ATTRACT CARDHOLDERS, INCLUDING PREMIUM CARDS WITH ENHANCED SERVICES OR

LINES OF CREDIT, AIRLINE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM MILEAGE CREDITS, CASH REBATES AND

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER REWARD OR REBATE PROGRAMS, SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, TEASER PROMOTIONAL INTEREST RATES FOR BOTH CREDIT CARD ACQUISITION AND BALANCE TRANSFERS, AND CO-BRANDED

ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS THAT OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDHOLDERS. IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR, AS COMPETITORS HAVE TARGETED OPENS CUSTOMER BASE AND OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN

PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES TO SMALL BUSINESSES.

MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT OFFER DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS ALSO ISSUE

DEBIT CARDS TO PERMIT DEPOSITORS TO ACCESS THEIR FUNDS. USE OF DEBIT CARDS FOR POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES HAS GROWN AS MOST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED ATM CARDS WITH GENERAL-PURPOSE DEBIT CARDS BEARING EITHER THE VISA OR MASTERCARD LOGO. AS A

RESULT, THE PURCHASE VOLUME AND NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS. DEBIT CARDS ARE MARKETED AS REPLACEMENTS FOR CASH AND CHECKS, AND TRANSACTIONS MADE

WITH DEBIT CARDS ARE TYPICALLY FOR SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS. THE ABILITY TO SUBSTITUTE DEBIT CARDS FOR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS IS LIMITED BECAUSE THERE IS NO CREDIT EXTENDED AND THE CONSUMER MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN HIS OR HER DEMAND DEPOSIT

ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR THE PURCHASE AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION AS OPPOSED TO CHARGE CARDS WHERE PAYMENT IS DUE AT THE END OF THE MONTH OR CREDIT CARDS WHERE PAYMENT CAN BE EXTENDED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ISSUE POINT-OF-SALE DEBIT

CARDS FOR USE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS

INCLUDE.



FEATURES AND THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING REWARDS PROGRAMS, PROVIDED TO CARDMEMBERS



THE NUMBER, SPENDING CHARACTERISTICS AND CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF CARDMEMBERS



THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ACCEPT CARDS



THE COST OF CARDS TO CARDMEMBERS



THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS TO MANAGE CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMIC CYCLE



THE ABILITY OF ISSUERS TO IMPLEMENT OPERATIONAL AND COST EFFICIENCIES



THE QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

AS THE PAYMENT INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO FACE COMPETITION FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS, SUCH AS ONLINE NETWORKS AND TELECOM PROVIDERS, THAT LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND

CUSTOMERS EXISTING CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT AND BANK RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT SOLUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EVOLUTION OF PAYMENT PRODUCTS IN EMERGING MARKETS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPED MARKETS. INSTEAD OF

MIGRATING FROM CASH TO CHECKS TO PLASTIC, TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER BEHAVIORS IN THESE MARKETS MAY RESULT IN THE SKIPPING OF ONE OR MORE STEPS TO ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS SUCH AS MOBILE PAYMENTS. FOR A DISCUSSION CONCERNING OUR RECENT

ACQUISITION OF REVOLUTION MONEY INC. IN THE EMERGING PAYMENTS AREA, PLEASE SEE ENTERPRISE GROWTH BEGINNING ON PAGE 34 BELOW.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY MEETS ITS FUNDING NEEDS THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING CASH OR

ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH, DEPOSITS PLACED WITH THE COMPANYS U.S. BANKS, UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, AND LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITIES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. MARKETS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TRS, ALONG WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (CREDCO),

ACQUIRES THE MAJORITY OF CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE USE OF CORPORATE CARDS ISSUED IN THE

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITED STATES AND CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CARDS ISSUED IN CERTAIN CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CREDCO FINANCES THE ACQUISITION OF RECEIVABLES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE SALE OF MEDIUM- AND

LONG-TERM NOTES. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB FINANCE THEIR REVOLVING CREDIT RECEIVABLES AND CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES, IN PART, THROUGH THE SALE OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND BY OFFERING CONSUMER DEPOSITS IN THE UNITED STATES.

TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ALSO TYPICALLY HAVE FUNDED RECEIVABLES THROUGH ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS. THE COST OF FUNDING CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS IS A MAJOR EXPENSE OF CARD OPERATIONS.

(YOU CAN FIND A DISCUSSION OF OUR SECURITIZATION AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES ON PAGES 40-43 UNDER THE CAPTION FINANCIAL

REVIEW, AND NOTE 7 ON PAGES

87-90 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH PORTIONS WE INCORPORATE HEREIN BY REFERENCE.) IN ADDITION, PLEASE SEE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND ECONOMY GENERALLY, AS

NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $26.3 BILLION IN TOTAL CONSUMER DEPOSITS, A LARGE PORTION OF WHICH WAS RAISED THROUGH BROKERAGE NETWORKS. OUR DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES COMPETE WITH OTHER

DEPOSIT-TAKING ORGANIZATIONS THAT SOURCE DEPOSITS THROUGH TELEPHONE, INTERNET AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DELIVERY CHANNELS, BROKERAGE NETWORKS, AND/OR THROUGH BRANCH LOCATIONS. WE COMPETE PRIMARILY IN THE DEPOSIT MARKETS ON THE BASIS OF PRICE AND OUR

BRAND REPUTATION FOR SAFETY AND SERVICE. WE SEEK TO OBTAIN THE DEPOSITS OF NEW CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS EXISTING CARD CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING ATTRACTIVE RATES AND MARKETING OUR NAME BRAND.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR BANK

SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT (FDIA) GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING OUR BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING

RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS (1) IT IS WELL-CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. A BANK THAT IS ADEQUATELY

CAPITALIZED GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DEPOSITS, IN EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC. THERE ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL-CAPITALIZED

(PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT ORDER, ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR).

CARD-ISSUING BUSINESSREGULATION

THE CHARGE CARD AND CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION. IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING.



THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (WHICH GENERALLY PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION IN THE GRANTING AND HANDLING OF CREDIT)



THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT (FCRA), AS AMENDED BY THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT (FACT ACT) (WHICH, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, REGULATES USE BY CREDITORS OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS AND CREDIT PRESCREENING PRACTICES AND REQUIRES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES WHEN AN APPLICATION FOR CREDIT IS REJECTED)



THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT (TILA) (WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES EXTENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS UPON WHICH CREDIT IS GRANTED),

INCLUDING THE AMENDMENTS TO TILA THAT WERE ADOPTED THROUGH THE ENACTMENT OF THE FAIR CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD DISCLOSURE ACT (WHICH MANDATES CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ON CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD APPLICATIONS)

FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT GENERALLY PROHIBIT ENGAGING IN UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES.

CERTAIN FEDERAL PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (SEE

CORPORATE & OTHER BELOW). FEDERAL LEGISLATION ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT

PROTECTION AND DISCLOSURE AND PRIVACY-RELATED LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES). BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS AFFECT US TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS RESULT IN AMOUNTS OWED BEING CLASSIFIED AS DELINQUENT

AND/OR CHARGED OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE. AS STATED ABOVE, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION THAT IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE SUPERVISION & REGULATIONGENERAL WITHIN CORPORATE & OTHER BELOW.

CENTURION BANK, AEBFSB AND OUR OTHER BANK ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THE REGULATORY APPLICATION OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION THEREOF COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OUR CARD AND LENDING

BUSINESSES OPERATE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND ROBUST. THE U.S. CONGRESS AND REGULATORS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS, HAVE CONTINUED THEIR FOCUS AND ATTENTION ON CERTAIN PRACTICES OF CREDIT CARD ISSUERS, SUCH AS UNFAIR AND

DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCREASES IN APRS, CHANGES IN THE TERMS OF THE ACCOUNT, AND THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF FEES AND FINANCIAL CHARGES CHARGED BY CARD ISSUERS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LATE PAYMENTS, RETURNED CHECKS, PAYMENTS BY TELEPHONE,

COPIES OF STATEMENTS AND THE LIKE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REFINE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN LIGHT OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS PRUDENTLY

AND CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE RECENTLY ENACTED CARD ACT, PLEASE SEE PRIVACY AND FAIR CREDIT REPORTING WITHIN SUPERVISION AND REGULATORY- GENERAL BELOW BEGINNING ON

IN JUNE 2009, WE ANNOUNCED THAT CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ENTERED INTO SEPARATE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH

THE FDIC AND THE OTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS RELATED TO CONVENIENCE CHECKS USED BY CERTAIN CARDMEMBERS, WHICH WERE DECLINED AS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN THE CARDMEMBERS RISK PROFILE. AMONG OTHER TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENTS, THE BANKS AGREED TO MODIFY CERTAIN PRACTICES OF THEIR CONVENIENCE CHECK PROGRAMS AND DISCLOSURES AND TO ASSIST QUALIFYING CARDMEMBERS IN THE REMOVAL OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NAMES FROM ANY BAD CHECK REGISTRY OR SIMILAR DATABASE

AND TO REFUND CERTAIN AMOUNTS TO AFFECTED CARDMEMBERS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION

COUNCIL (THE FFIEC), AN INTERAGENCY BODY COMPOSED OF THE PRINCIPAL U.S. FEDERAL ENTITIES THAT REGULATE BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE TO THE INDUSTRY ON CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT AND LOSS ALLOWANCE

PRACTICES (THE GUIDANCE). THE GUIDANCE COVERS FIVE AREAS: (I) CREDIT LINE MANAGEMENT; (II) OVER-LIMIT PRACTICES; (III) MINIMUM PAYMENT AND NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION PRACTICES; (IV) WORKOUT AND FORBEARANCE PRACTICES; AND

(V) CERTAIN INCOME (FEE) RECOGNITION AND LOSS ALLOWANCE PRACTICES. THE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT COMPRISE THE FFIEC, ALTHOUGH IT IS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF THE IDENTIFICATION BY BANK REGULATORS IN THEIR EXAMINATIONS OF OTHER CREDIT CARD LENDERS PRACTICES DEEMED BY THEM TO BE INAPPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, WITH REGARD TO SUBPRIME LENDING PROGRAMS. AT PRESENT, WE DO NOT

HAVE ANY LENDING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE SUBPRIME MARKET. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB EVALUATE AND DISCUSS THE GUIDANCE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS PART OF THEIR

REGULATORY EXAMINATION PROCESSES, AND, AS A RESULT, MAY REFINE THEIR PRACTICES FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON REGULATORY INPUT. THE GUIDANCE HAS NOT HAD, NOR DO WE EXPECT IT TO HAVE, ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES OR PRACTICES.

OPPORTUNITY. FOR A DISCUSSION OF CARDS ISSUED INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH OUR GNS PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS, PLEASE SEE THE SECTION GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES ABOVE.

THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO BOLSTER ITS INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CARD BUSINESS THROUGH THE LAUNCH OF NUMEROUS NEW OR

ENHANCED CARD PRODUCTS DURING 2009. THESE ARE CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, EITHER ON OUR OWN OR, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW, AS CO-BRANDS WITH PARTNERING INSTITUTIONS. THIS PAST YEAR, AMONG OTHER NEW PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, WE ANNOUNCED OR LAUNCHED CARDS WITH

SAS SCANDINAVIAN AIRLINES IN SWEDEN, ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. IN JAPAN AND THE EXPRESS REWARDS CREDIT CARD

SM

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE OFFER VARIOUS FLEXIBLE PAYMENT OPTIONS SIMILAR TO OUR SIGN & TRAVEL

®

PROGRAM AND OUR EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTION TO CARDMEMBERS IN SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

ALSO, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE

ISSUE CARDS INTERNATIONALLY UNDER DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH BANKS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS IS AFFINITY CARDS WITH FRATERNAL, PROFESSIONAL, EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN

PENETRATING THE AFFINITY CARD SEGMENT IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE WE ISSUE CARDS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGEST PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THAT COUNTRY. IN AUSTRALIA, AFFINITY CARDS ARE A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR TOTAL REVOLVING PORTFOLIO AND CONTRIBUTE

TO OUR PROPRIETARY CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES.

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, REWARDS PROGRAMS ARE A STRONG DRIVER OF CARDMEMBER

SPENDING IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER BUSINESS. WE HAVE MORE THAN 1,500 REDEMPTION PARTNERS ACROSS OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WITH AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 84 PARTNERS IN EACH COUNTRY; APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THESE PARTNERS ARE IN THE TRAVEL

INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARDCOMPETITION

COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES, CONSUMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES USE GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS FOR A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF

THEIR TOTAL PAYMENTS, WITH SOME LARGE EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES JUST BEGINNING TO TRANSITION TO CARD USAGE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. ALTHOUGH OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IS WIDESPREAD, WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT SHARE IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE

OPERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONALLY, OUR PROPRIETARY CARD-ISSUING BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM MULTINATIONAL BANKS, SUCH AS CITIBANK, HSBC AND BANCO SANTANDER, AS WELL AS MANY LOCAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

GLOBALLY, WE VIEW CITIBANK AND HSBC AS OUR STRONGEST COMPETITORS, AS THEY CURRENTLY OFFER CARD PRODUCTS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF MARKETS.

INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CARDREGULATION

AS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, REGULATORS IN

2009 CONTINUED TO INTRODUCE A VARIETY OF PROPOSED REFORMS TO THE PAYMENTS LANDSCAPE IN A NUMBER OF OUR KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED. WE EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE IN 2010. REGULATORS CONTINUE TO CONSIDER

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO HELP INFORM AND GUIDE THEIR POLICY. WHILE THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSALS VARY, A NUMBER OF MARKETS HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON PRICING, DISCLOSURE AND OTHER CARD PRACTICES AND WE EXPECT THIS TO

CONTINUE IN 2010.

AS A CONSEQUENCE, INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY CONSIDER AND IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL CARD PRACTICE REGULATION IN

2010. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS PLANNING IN LIGHT OF CHANGING MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE EVOLVING POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND MEDIA ENVIRONMENT.

CORPORATE CARDS IN 41 COUNTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL DOLLAR/EURO CORPORATE CARDS IN 84 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CORPORATE CARDS ISSUED THROUGH OUR GNS PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS FOR PRESENCE IN 31 ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES.

BUSINESSES CONTROL MEETING-RELATED EXPENSES. IT ALLOWS CLIENTS TO CAPTURE MEETING SPENDING, TO SIMPLIFY THE PAYMENT PROCESS, AND TO GAIN ACCESS TO DATA TO SUPPORT NEGOTIATIONS WITH SUPPLIERS.

WE ALSO OFFER A SERIES OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS PAYMENT SOLUTIONS TO HELP COMPANIES MANAGE NON-T&E (OR B2B) SPENDING. THIS TYPE OF

SPENDING BY CORPORATIONS HELPS TO DIVERSIFY OUR SPEND MIX BEYOND TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT. THESE SOLUTIONS PROVIDE A VARIETY OF BENEFITS TO COMPANIES INCLUDING COST SAVINGS, PROCESS EFFICIENCY, IMPROVED CASH FLOW AND INCREASED VISIBILITY, CONTROL

PAYMENTS, EXTEND THEIR OWN DAYS PAYABLE OUTSTANDING OR FLOAT, AND INCREASE THEIR CASH ON HAND. BUYER INITIATED PAYMENT HAS BEEN OFFERED FIRST TO CLIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND WILL BE OFFERED IN OTHER MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD IN 2011. THIS

SOLUTION IS BEST SUITED FOR MID- TO LARGE-SIZED COMPANIES THAT WANT TO TRANSITION RAPIDLY TO ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS, REDUCE SUPPLIER INQUIRIES, CONVERT PAPER TO ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS, AND OPTIMIZE CASH FLOW.

IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING EXPENSE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO LARGE AND GLOBAL CORPORATIONS, GCC MARKETS COMMERCIAL CARD PROGRAMS TO MIDDLE-MARKET

COMPANIES (DEFINED IN THE UNITED STATES AS FIRMS WITH ANNUAL REVENUES OF $10 MILLION TO $1 BILLION WORLDWIDE). GCC IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS WITH MID-SIZED COMPANIES, WHICH REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. BUSINESSES

OF THIS SIZE OFTEN DO NOT HAVE A COMMERCIAL CARD PROGRAM. HOWEVER, ONCE ENROLLED IN A COMMERCIAL CARD PROGRAM, MID-SIZED COMPANIES, WHICH USUALLY DO NOT HAVE WELL-DEFINED PURCHASING PROGRAMS, TYPICALLY PUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR BUSINESS

SPENDING (BOTH T&E AND NON-T&E, SUCH AS OFFICE SUPPLIES) ON THE COMMERCIAL CARD BECAUSE THEY CAN GAIN CONTROL, SAVINGS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

AMERICAN EXPRESS ALSO PARTNERS WITH MANY OTHER COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO OFFER A NUMBER OF CO-BRAND CORPORATE CARDS IN VARIOUS MARKETS. THESE PRODUCTS, TYPICALLY SUITED FOR MID-SIZED COMPANIES,

WITH MAINTAINING ACCOUNTS AND ENSURING PROGRAM COMPLIANCE.

GLOBAL COMMERCIAL CARDCOMPETITION

IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE INTEREST IN EXPENSE MANAGEMENT TOOLS IS PARTICULARLY STRONG, AS CLIENTS AIM TO CAPTURE DATA, ANALYZE

TRENDS AND MAKE DECISIONS THAT ENHANCE THEIR CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY. BOTH VISA AND MASTERCARD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CARD ISSUERS SUCH AS U.S. BANK, JPMORGAN CHASE, AND CITIBANK TO BUILD AND SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING NECESSARY TO

SIMPLICITY, AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE ARE AMONG THE KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE COMMERCIAL CARD BUSINESS.

THE WORLD.

GLOBAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES (GFES) CONSISTS OF RETAIL AND WHOLESALE FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES AND

GLOBAL TRAVEL SERVICESCOMPETITION

BUSINESS TRAVEL CONTINUES TO FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FROM NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE TRAVEL

MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AS WELL AS FROM DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES AND OTHER TRAVEL SUPPLIERS. COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE, SERVICE, VALUE CREATION, CONVENIENCE, GLOBAL CAPABILITIES AND PROXIMITY TO THE

CUSTOMER. COMPETITION ALSO COMES FROM CORPORATE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES, AS SOME COMPANIES HAVE BECOME ACCREDITED AS IN-HOUSE CORPORATE TRAVEL AGENTS.

FOR MANY YEARS, TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES HAVE FACED PRESSURE ON REVENUES FROM AIRLINES, AS MOST CARRIERS HAVE STOPPED PAYING BASE COMMISSIONS TO TRAVEL AGENTS FOR TICKETS SOLD AND

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OTHER FORMS OF TRAVEL AGENT COMPENSATION. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THEY BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR WEB SITES AND OTHER MEANS. THESE TRENDS HAVE REDUCED THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL

MANAGEMENT COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT RECEIVE DISTRIBUTION REVENUE FROM DIRECTLY BOOKED TRANSACTIONS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS INCLUDING EXPANDED

GRANTS OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES. THIS IMMUNITY ENABLES AIRLINES TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS. THESE TYPES OF STRUCTURAL

CHANGES MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THESE ISSUES, PLEASE SEE RISK FACTORSWE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE

AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS ON PAGE

OVERALL, INTENSE

COMPETITION AMONG TRAVEL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, THE ONGOING TRENDS OF INCREASING DIRECT SALES BY AIRLINES, THE RISE OF LOW-COST CARRIERS AND ONGOING REDUCTIONS IN OR ELIMINATION OF AIRLINE COMMISSIONS AND FEES, CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON REVENUE FOR

TRAVEL AGENTS.

OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE EVOLVED OUR BUSINESS MODEL ALLOWING US TO CHARGE CUSTOMERS FOR THE SERVICES WE

PROVIDE AND THE VALUE WE CREATE, AND RESTRUCTURED OUR EXPENSE BASE THROUGH THE RATIONALIZATION OF OUR CALL CENTER LOCATIONS AND THE TRANSITIONING OF MANY OF OUR SERVICES ONLINE. THIS RESTRUCTURING, AS WELL AS OUR GLOBAL PRESENCE, HAS HELPED US TO

BALANCE THESE REVENUE PRESSURES. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR NEW WAYS TO ENHANCE THE VALUE WE DELIVER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE FOCUSING ON DEVELOPING NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH

ENHANCE THE VALUE WE DELIVER TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS AND ADDRESS ONGOING TRAVEL INDUSTRY CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES.

CORPORATE & OTHER

CORPORATE & OTHER CONSISTS OF CORPORATE

FUNCTIONS AND AUXILIARY BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS PUBLISHING BUSINESS, TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANY OPERATIONS. WE ALSO DISCUSS INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE IN THIS SECTION.

GLOBAL PREPAID

®

TRAVELERS CHEQUE (TRAVELERS CHEQUE OR CHEQUE) AS A SAFE AND CONVENIENT ALTERNATIVE TO CASH. TRAVELERS CHEQUES ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN U.S.

GROWTH PROPERTIES, AND WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE NETWORK OF RETAIL LOCATIONS AT WHICH OUR GIFT CARD PRODUCTS ARE SOLD.

GLOBAL

PREPAIDCOMPETITION

TRAVELERS CHEQUES COMPETE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT PRODUCTS INCLUDING CASH,

FOREIGN CURRENCY, CHECKS, OTHER BRANDS OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, DEBIT, PREPAID AND ATM CARDS AND, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, OTHER PAYMENT CARDS. OUR PREPAID CARDS COMPETE WITH THE SAME PAYMENT METHODS, AND IN PARTICULAR, WITH CASH, CHECKS AND OTHER

OPEN-SYSTEM AND STORE-SPECIFIC GIFT CARDS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING THE TRAVELERS CHECK AND PREPAID CARD

INDUSTRY ARE.



THE NUMBER AND LOCATION OF MERCHANTS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE FORM OF PAYMENT



THE AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER OF OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT



THE AMOUNT OF FEES CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER



THE COMPENSATION PAID TO, AND FREQUENCY OF SETTLEMENT BY, SELLING OUTLETS



THE ACCESSIBILITY OF SALES AND REFUNDS FOR THE PRODUCTS



THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS



THE ABILITY TO SERVICE THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTORILY, INCLUDING FOR LOST OR STOLEN INSTRUMENTS.

GLOBAL PREPAIDREGULATION

AS AN ISSUER OF TRAVELERS CHECKS, WE ARE REGULATED IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE MONEY TRANSMITTER OR SALE OF CHECK LAWS IN EFFECT IN MOST STATES. THESE LAWS REQUIRE TRAVELERS CHECK (AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, PREPAID

CARD) ISSUERS TO OBTAIN LICENSES, TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CRITERIA, TO HOLD OUTSTANDING PROCEEDS OF SALE IN HIGHLY RATED AND SECURE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE DETAILED REPORTS. WE INVEST THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF OUR TRAVELERS CHEQUES

AND PREPAID CARDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW, PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGHLY RATED DEBT SECURITIES CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS. MANY STATES EXAMINE LICENSEES ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION,

FEDERAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REGISTRATION OF TRAVELER CHECK ISSUERS AS MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES AND COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY ISSUERS

AND SELLING OUTLETS. AT THIS TIME, STORED VALUE ISSUERS AND REDEEMERS, WHILE CONSIDERED TO BE MONEY SERVICE BUSINESSES, ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER UNDER THESE REGULATIONS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE VARYING LICENSING AND

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES.

TRAVELERS CHECK ISSUERS

ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAWS OF MANY STATES TO COMPLY WITH STATE UNCLAIMED AND ABANDONED PROPERTY LAWS UNDER WHICH SUCH ISSUERS MUST PAY TO STATES THE FACE AMOUNT OF ANY TRAVELERS CHECK THAT IS UNCASHED OR UNREDEEMED AFTER 15 YEARS. THE ABANDONED

PROPERTY LAWS OF NUMEROUS STATES ALSO APPLY TO PREPAID CARDS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS.

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN MAY 2009, THE CARD ACT AMENDED PROVISIONS OF THE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER ACT TO IMPOSE

NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE TERMS OF GIFT CARDS AND CERTAIN OTHER PREPAID CARDS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE FEES THAT MAY BE CHARGED, EXPIRATION DATES, AND CONSUMER DISCLOSURES. UNDER THE CARD ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST PROMULGATE REGULATIONS TO

IMPLEMENTS ITS GIFT CARD PROVISIONS, WHICH REGULATIONS WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN AUGUST 2010. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE ALSO ENACTED LAWS PERTAINING TO THE ISSUANCE AND THE SALE OF GIFT CARDS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR STATE LEGISLATIVE

ACTIVITY RESTRICTING THE TERMS OF GIFT CARDS. IN CERTAIN STATES WHERE REGULATION CONTINUES TO RESTRICT FEES AND HAS MADE IT UNPROFITABLE FOR US TO OFFER GIFT CARDS, WE HAVE LIMITED OR WITHDRAWN FROM SELLING THESE CARDS.

GLOBAL SERVICES GROUP

AS PART OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER 2009, MANAGEMENT CREATED A NEW GLOBAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION TO HEIGHTEN THE

COMPANYS FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TO ENSURE ALL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED AS EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. WE ARE ORGANIZING SUPPORT FUNCTIONS BY PROCESS RATHER THAN BUSINESS UNIT, WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS WILL

STREAMLINE COSTS, REDUCE DUPLICATION OF WORK, BETTER INTEGRATE SKILLS AND EXPERTISE, AND IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

GLOBAL

WORLD SERVICE

WE HAVE CONSOLIDATED OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE UNITS HAVE WORKED OVER A

NUMBER OF YEARS TO ENSURE OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IMPROVING OPERATING MARGINS. AS MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS REPORT, J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES RELEASED ITS ANNUAL NATIONWIDE CREDIT CARD SATISFACTION STUDY AND RANKED

SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE

WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, IN OUR CARD SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW

FASTER INTRODUCTION AND GREATER CUSTOMIZATION OF PRODUCTS. WE ALSO ARE USING TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICE CAPABILITIES TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER A HIGH QUALITY CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAINTAIN A SERVICE DELIVERY PLATFORM

THAT OUR EMPLOYEES USE IN THE CARD BUSINESS TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER SERVICING AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE, UPDATING OF CARDMEMBER INFORMATION, THE ADDITION OF NEW CARDS TO AN ACCOUNT AND RESOLVING CUSTOMER

SATISFACTION ISSUES. IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE ARE ENHANCING OUR GLOBAL PLATFORMS AND CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS IN REVOLVING CREDIT.

WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE THE INTERNET TO LOWER COSTS, IMPROVE SERVICE QUALITY AND ENHANCE OUR BUSINESS MODEL. DURING 2009, WE CONTINUED TO BROADEN OUR FOCUS TO USE THE INTERNET TO DRIVE REVENUE AND BUILD OUR BRAND, WHILE CONTINUING TO

MIGRATE TRANSACTION VOLUMES AT LOWER COSTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE INTERACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THAN WE DO BY TELEPHONE OR IN PERSON.

AS OF YEAR-END, CUSTOMERS HAD ENROLLED APPROXIMATELY 26 MILLION CARDS GLOBALLY IN OUR MANAGE YOUR CARD ACCOUNT SERVICE. THIS SERVICE ENABLES CARDMEMBERS TO REVIEW AND PAY THEIR AMERICAN

EXPRESS BILLS ELECTRONICALLY, VIEW AND SERVICE THEIR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM ACCOUNTS AND CONDUCT VARIOUS OTHER FUNCTIONS QUICKLY AND SECURELY ONLINE. WE NOW HAVE AN ONLINE PRESENCE IN 23 MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM,

AUSTRALIA, ITALY, FRANCE, MEXICO AND JAPAN.

WE CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO ENSURE

THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF DATA INTEGRITY, SECURITY AND PRIVACY. IN 2006, WE AND SEVERAL OTHER PAYMENT CARD NETWORKS FORMED PCI SSC, AN INDEPENDENT STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL DATA SECURITY STANDARDS. IN 2009, WE

BECAME AN OWNER-MEMBER OF EMVCO, THE STANDARDS BODY THAT MANAGES, MAINTAINS, AND ENHANCES SPECIFICATIONS FOR CHIP-BASED PAYMENT CARDS AND ACCEPTANCE DEVICES, INCLUDING POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS, SEE THE

GLOBAL MERCHANT SERVICES SECTION ABOVE.)

IN 2002, WE OUTSOURCED MOST OF OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT

AND SUPPORT TO IBM. THE VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS COVERED UNDER OUR AGREEMENT WITH IBM RANGE IN TERM FROM 8 TO 12 YEARS, WITH CERTAIN RIGHTS TO EXTEND. THIS ARRANGEMENT CURRENTLY ENABLES US TO BENEFIT FROM IBMS EXPERTISE WHILE LOWERING OUR

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS. IBM IS CURRENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING MOST OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING MOST OF OUR MAINFRAME AND MIDRANGE COMPUTING SYSTEMS; WEB HOSTING; DATABASE ADMINISTRATION; AND A PORTION

OF OUR HELP DESK SERVICES FUNCTION. WE ALSO OUTSOURCE OTHER TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE FUNCTIONS TO OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. OUR INTERNAL IT ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO RETAIN THE COMPANYS KEY TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCIES, INCLUDING

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY, INFORMATION SECURITY, MANAGING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH TECHNOLOGIES PARTNERS, DATA CENTER OPERATIONS, DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING APPLICATIONS AND DATABASES AND MANAGING THE TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIOS OF OUR

BUSINESSES.

ENTERPRISE GROWTH

AS PART OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES, WE ALSO ARE CREATING A NEW ENTERPRISE GROWTH GROUP TO LEVERAGE EXISTING ASSETS, GENERATE INCREMENTAL FEE REVENUE AND DRIVE OUR ENTRY INTO NEW PAYMENT AREAS AND

RELATED BUSINESSES. THE OBJECTIVE FOR THE ENTERPRISE GROWTH ORGANIZATION IS TO DEVELOP OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH THAT TRANSCEND INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS THAT ARE EMERGING ACROSS THE PAYMENTS

INDUSTRY.

CONSISTENT WITH OUR FOCUS ON NEW PAYMENTS AREAS, ON JANUARY 15, 2010, WE PURCHASED REVOLUTION MONEY INC., A

PROVIDER OF SECURE PERSON-TO-PERSON PAYMENT SERVICES THROUGH AN INTERNET BASED PLATFORM, FOR APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION. REVOLUTION MONEYS ONLINE PERSON-TO-PERSON PAYMENT ACCOUNTS ARE FDIC INSURED AND SUITED FOR SOCIAL AND INSTANT MESSAGING

SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONGENERAL

OVERVIEW

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND TRS ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. UNDER THE SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL REGULATION ESTABLISHED UNDER THE BHC ACT, THE FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISES THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES, AS AN UMBRELLA

REGULATOR OF THE CONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATION AND GENERALLY DEFERS TO THE PRIMARY U.S. REGULATORS OF THE COMPANYS U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, AS APPLICABLE, AND TO THE OTHER U.S. REGULATORS OF THE COMPANYS U.S.

NON-DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES THAT REGULATE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH AS INSURANCE COMPANIES REGULATED BY STATE INSURANCE AUTHORITIES.

MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS REGULATION BY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES AND BY NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR REGULATORY BODIES

AND SECURITIES EXCHANGES. CERTAIN OF OUR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 (SARBANES-OXLEY) AND RELATED REGULATIONS AND RULES OF THE SEC AND

THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, TO THE EXTENT THAT DIFFERENT REGULATORY SYSTEMS IMPOSE OVERLAPPING OR INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE FACE COMPLEXITY AND ADDITIONAL COSTS IN OUR

COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES TO EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN INTERPRETATION

OR ENFORCEMENT) COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, SEVERE MARKET DISRUPTIONS IN 2008 HAVE LED TO NUMEROUS PROPOSALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY FOR POTENTIALLY

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. PLEASE SEE RISK FACTORSPROPOSED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REFORMS COULD, IF ENACTED OR ADOPTED, RESULT IN OUR BUSINESS BECOMING SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND

EXTENSIVE ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ON PAGES 70-71 FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

BANKING REGULATION

FEDERAL AND STATE BANKING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES EXTENSIVELY REGULATE THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, INCLUDING PRESCRIBING STANDARDS RELATING TO CAPITAL, EARNINGS, LIQUIDITY,

DIVIDENDS, THE REPURCHASE OR REDEMPTION OF SHARES, LOANS OR EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO AFFILIATES AND INSIDERS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INTERNAL AUDIT SYSTEMS, LOAN DOCUMENTATION, CREDIT UNDERWRITING, ASSET GROWTH AND IMPAIRED ASSETS.

SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR THE PROTECTION OF DEPOSITORS, OTHER CUSTOMERS AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUNDS, AS WELL AS TO MINIMIZE SYSTEMIC RISK, AND NOT FOR THE PROTECTION OF HOLDERS OF OUR

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SECURITIES. BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE BROAD EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT POWER OVER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THE POWER TO IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL FINES, LIMIT

DIVIDENDS, RESTRICT OPERATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS AND REQUIRE DIVESTITURES. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANKS, AS WELL AS SUBSIDIARIES OF BOTH, ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ENGAGING IN PRACTICES THAT THE RELEVANT REGULATORY AUTHORITY DEEMS UNSAFE OR

UNSOUND.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS AND ACTIVITIES

THE BHC ACT LIMITS THE NONBANKING ACTIVITIES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. UNLESS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY HAS QUALIFIED AS A FINANCIAL

HOLDING COMPANY, ITS NONBANKING ACTIVITIES ARE RESTRICTED TO THOSE SO CLOSELY RELATED TO BANKING AS TO BE A PROPER INCIDENT THERETO. AN ELIGIBLE BANK HOLDING COMPANY MAY ELECT TO BE A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED

TO ENGAGE IN A BROADER RANGE OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES. A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY MAY ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY RULE OR ORDER TO BE FINANCIAL IN NATURE, INCIDENTAL TO SUCH FINANCIAL ACTIVITY, OR (WITH PRIOR FEDERAL RESERVE

APPROVAL) COMPLEMENTARY TO A FINANCIAL ACTIVITY AND THAT DOES NOT POSE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THE SAFETY OR SOUNDNESS OF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OR TO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM GENERALLY. AMERICAN EXPRESS ENGAGES IN VARIOUS ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE ONLY

FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR PROVIDING TRAVEL AGENCY SERVICES, ACTING AS A FINDER AND CERTAIN INSURANCE UNDERWRITING AND AGENCY SERVICES.

FOR A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS, ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MUST BE

WELL CAPITALIZED AND WELL MANAGED AND HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST A SATISFACTORY RATING ON ITS MOST RECENT COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT OF 1977 (THE CRA) REVIEW. IF, AFTER BECOMING A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND

UNDERTAKING ACTIVITIES IN RELIANCE ON SUCH QUALIFICATION, THE COMPANY FAILS TO CONTINUE TO MEET APPLICABLE CAPITAL OR MANAGERIAL STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY STATUS, THE COMPANY MUST ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO

COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE CAPITAL AND MANAGERIAL STANDARDS. MOREOVER, UNTIL ALL RELEVANT CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED, THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES MAY NOT, WITHOUT THE FEDERAL RESERVES PRIOR APPROVAL, COMMENCE ANY ADDITIONAL

ACTIVITIES, OR ACQUIRE CONTROL OR SHARES OF ANY COMPANY, IN RELIANCE ON THE COMPANYS STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY, AND THE COMPANY MUST COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE IMPOSES. IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT

RETURN TO COMPLIANCE WITHIN 180 DAYS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE MAY ORDER THE COMPANY TO DIVEST ITS SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS OR THE COMPANY MAY DISCONTINUE OR DIVEST INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES PERMISSIBLE ONLY FOR A BANK

HOLDING COMPANY THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. IF ANY SUBSIDIARY U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FAILS TO MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE CRA, AMERICAN EXPRESS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME

RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIVITIES AND ACQUISITIONS AS SET FORTH ABOVE.

ACTIVITIES AND ACQUISITIONS

THE BHC ACT REQUIRES A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO OBTAIN THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEFORE: (1) IT MAY ACQUIRE DIRECT OR

INDIRECT OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SHARES OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, IF AFTER SUCH ACQUISITION, THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY WILL DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OWN OR CONTROL MORE THAN 5% OF ANY CLASS OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF THE

INSTITUTION; (2) IT OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OTHER THAN A BANK, MAY ACQUIRE ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ANY BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION; OR (3) IT MAY MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH ANY OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

THE RIEGLE-NEAL INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1994, AS AMENDED (THE INTERSTATE BANKING ACT),

GENERALLY PERMITS BANK HOLDING COMPANIES TO ACQUIRE BANKS IN ANY STATE, AND PREEMPTS ALL STATE LAWS RESTRICTING THE OWNERSHIP BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY OF BANKS IN MORE THAN ONE STATE. THE INTERSTATE BANKING ACT ALSO PERMITS (1) A BANK TO MERGE

WITH AN OUT-OF-STATE BANK AND CONVERT ANY OFFICES INTO BRANCHES OF THE RESULTING BANK IF BOTH STATES HAVE NOT OPTED OUT OF INTERSTATE BRANCHING, (2) A BANK TO ACQUIRE BRANCHES FROM AN OUT-OF-STATE BANK IF THE LAW OF THE STATE WHERE THE BRANCHES

ARE LOCATED PERMITS THE INTERSTATE BRANCH ACQUISITION AND (3) BANKS TO ESTABLISH AND OPERATE

DE NOVO

INTERSTATE BRANCHES WHENEVER THE HOST STATE OPTS-IN TO

DE NOVO

BRANCHING. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND BANKS SEEKING TO ENGAGE IN

TRANSACTIONS AUTHORIZED BY THE INTERSTATE BANKING ACT MUST BE ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND MANAGED.

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST APPROVE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO AN EXISTING

NON-U.S. INVESTMENT AND CERTAIN DIRECT AND INDIRECT ACQUISITIONS BY THE COMPANY OF AN INTEREST IN A NON-U.S. COMPANY, INCLUDING IN A FOREIGN BANK, AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT BY CENTURION BANK OF FOREIGN BRANCHES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL ACT PROHIBITS A PERSON, ENTITY, OR GROUP OF PERSONS OR ENTITIES ACTING IN CONCERT, FROM ACQUIRING

CONTROL OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANY SUCH AS THE COMPANY UNLESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BEEN GIVEN PRIOR NOTICE AND HAS NOT OBJECTED TO THE TRANSACTION. UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS, THE ACQUISITION OF 10% OR MORE OF A CLASS OF VOTING

STOCK OF THE COMPANY WOULD CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF THE COMPANY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

IN ADDITION, ANY COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNDER THE BHC ACT BEFORE ACQUIRING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OF OR CONTROL OVER 25% OR MORE OF

ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY OR THE POWER TO EXERCISE A CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER THE COMPANY. IN THE CASE OF AN ACQUIRER THAT IS A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE BHC ACT REQUIRES APPROVAL OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR

THE ACQUISITION OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY, IF THE ACQUISITION RESULTS IN THE BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY CONTROLLING MORE THAN 5% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ANY CLASS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY.

SOURCE OF STRENGTH

UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY, THE COMPANY IS EXPECTED TO ACT AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO CENTURION BANK AND TO COMMIT CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT IT. SUCH SUPPORT MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE AT TIMES WHEN, ABSENT FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY, WE OTHERWISE MIGHT DETERMINE NOT TO PROVIDE IT. CAPITAL LOANS BY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARY BANKS ARE SUBORDINATE IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO DEPOSITS AND TO CERTAIN OTHER

INDEBTEDNESS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY BANKS. IN THE EVENT OF A BANK HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, ANY COMMITMENT BY THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY TO A FEDERAL BANK REGULATOR TO MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL OF A SUBSIDIARY BANK WILL BE ASSUMED BY THE BANKRUPTCY

TRUSTEE AND ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY OF PAYMENT.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY

THE COMPANY, TRS, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL

BANKING REGULATORS. THERE ARE TWO RISK-BASED MEASURES OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN PROMULGATED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, AS WELL AS A LEVERAGE MEASURE.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY CALCULATES ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER GUIDELINES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, BASED ON THE 1998 CAPITAL

ACCORD (BASEL I) OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION (THE BASEL COMMITTEE). THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MORE SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENCES IN CREDIT AND MARKET

RISK PROFILES AMONG BANKS AND FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES, TO ACCOUNT FOR OFF-BALANCE-SHEET EXPOSURE, AND TO MINIMIZE DISINCENTIVES FOR HOLDING LIQUID ASSETS. ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS ARE ASSIGNED TO BROAD RISK CATEGORIES, EACH WITH

APPROPRIATE WEIGHTS. THE RESULTING CAPITAL RATIOS REPRESENT CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS.

UNDER BASEL I, AS ADOPTED BY THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES, THE MINIMUM GUIDELINE FOR THE RATIO OF TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (INCLUDING CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS, SUCH

AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT) IS 8%. AT LEAST HALF OF THE TOTAL CAPITAL MUST BE COMPOSED OF TIER 1 CAPITAL, WHICH INCLUDES COMMON EQUITY, UNDIVIDED PROFITS, MINORITY INTERESTS IN THE EQUITY ACCOUNTS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (INCLUDING, FOR BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES BUT NOT BANKS, TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES), NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK AND FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (BUT NOT BANKS) A LIMITED AMOUNT OF CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. TIER 2 CAPITAL MAY CONSIST OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, QUALIFYING SUBORDINATED DEBT, MANDATORILY CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, OTHER PREFERRED STOCK AND TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND OTHER SO-CALLED RESTRICTED CORE CAPITAL ELEMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO 25% OF TIER 1 CAPITAL. THE MINIMUM GUIDELINE FOR THE RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK

WEIGHTED ASSETS IS 4%.

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN JUNE 2004, THE BASEL COMMITTEE PUBLISHED NEW INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING

REGULATORY CAPITAL (BASEL II). IN DECEMBER 2007, THE U.S. BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES JOINTLY ADOPTED A FINAL RULE BASED ON BASEL II. THE COMPANY, CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE REQUIRED NOW TO TRANSITION TO THE BASEL II-BASED GUIDELINES,

ABSENT A WAIVER. THE FINAL RULE PROVIDES FOR A SERIES OF THREE TRANSITIONAL PERIODS DURING WHICH THE COMPANY MUST CALCULATE ITS RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS UNDER BOTH THE BASEL I-BASED GUIDELINES AND THE NEW BASEL II-BASED GUIDELINES, WITH THE MINIMUM

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIODS BEING THE GREATER OF THE REQUIRED CAPITAL AS CALCULATED UNDER THE FINAL RULE AND A DESIGNATED PERCENTAGE OF REQUIRED CAPITAL AS CALCULATED UNDER BASEL I. PRIOR TO BEGINNING THE THREE TRANSITIONAL

PERIODS, WE MUST COMPLETE A SATISFACTORY PARALLEL-RUN PERIOD OF NO LESS THAN FOUR CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR QUARTERS DURING WHICH WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONFIDENTIALLY REPORT REGULATORY CAPITAL UNDER BOTH THE BASEL I AND BASEL II REGULATIONS. UNDER THE

FINAL RULE, WE MUST ADOPT A BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BASEL II AND BEGIN THE FIRST TRANSITIONAL PERIOD FOR CAPITAL CALCULATION UNDER THE FINAL RULE NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2013, UNLESS THIS TIME IS EXTENDED BY THE

FEDERAL RESERVE.

IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ESTABLISHED MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO GUIDELINES FOR BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES. THESE GUIDELINES PROVIDE FOR A MINIMUM RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS, LESS GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (THE LEVERAGE RATIO), OF 3% FOR BANK HOLDING COMPANIES THAT MEET CERTAIN SPECIFIED

CRITERIA, INCLUDING HAVING THE HIGHEST REGULATORY RATING. ALL OTHER BANK HOLDING COMPANIES GENERALLY ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 4%. THE GUIDELINES ALSO PROVIDE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES EXPERIENCING INTERNAL GROWTH OR

MAKING ACQUISITIONS WILL BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN STRONG CAPITAL POSITIONS SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE MINIMUM SUPERVISORY LEVELS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT RELIANCE ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FURTHERMORE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL CONSIDER A

TANGIBLE TIER 1 CAPITAL LEVERAGE RATIO (DEDUCTING ALL INTANGIBLES) AND OTHER INDICATORS OF CAPITAL STRENGTH IN EVALUATING PROPOSALS FOR EXPANSION OR NEW ACTIVITIES.

AS A SUPERVISORY MATTER, FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES EXPECT MOST BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, AND IN PARTICULAR LARGER BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES SUCH AS THE COMPANY, TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS THAT, AT A MINIMUM, QUALIFY A BANK HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL CAPITALIZED. THE REQUIRED RATIOS TO QUALIFY AS WELL CAPITALIZED

ARE A TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10%, A TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 6% AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 5%. FOLLOWING THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE ENCOURAGED LARGER BANK

HOLDING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL RATIOS APPRECIABLY ABOVE EVEN THE WELL-CAPITALIZED STANDARD. MOREOVER, THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS FOCUSING MORE ON THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENT THAT COMMON EQUITY BE THE PREDOMINANT ELEMENT OF TIER 1

CAPITAL. IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ASSESSED THE CAPITAL ADEQUACY OF THE COUNTRYS 19 LARGEST BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, UNDER A SO-CALLED STRESS TEST RELATING PRIMARILY TO LOAN QUALITY.

FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CAPITAL RATIOS, PLEASE SEE CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY ON PAGES

39-40 OF

OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

PROPOSED CAPITAL AND

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2009, THE BASEL COMMITTEE ISSUED TWO CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENTS PROPOSING REFORMS TO BANK

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REGULATION. THE BASEL COMMITTEES CAPITAL PROPOSALS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REVISE THE DEFINITIONS OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THEY WOULD: (I) RE-EMPHASIZE THAT COMMON EQUITY IS THE

PREDOMINANT COMPONENT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL BY (A) ADDING A MINIMUM COMMON EQUITY TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO, WITH THE RATIO ITSELF TO BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF AN IMPACT STUDY THAT THE BASEL COMMITTEE IS CONDUCTING, AND

(B) REQUIRING THAT GOODWILL, GENERAL INTANGIBLES AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS THAT CURRENTLY MUST BE DEDUCTED FROM TIER 1 CAPITAL INSTEAD BE DEDUCTED FROM COMMON EQUITY AS A COMPONENT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL; (II) DISQUALIFY INNOVATIVE CAPITAL

INSTRUMENTS  INCLUDING U.S.-STYLE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY PAY CUMULATIVE DIVIDENDS  FROM TIER 1 CAPITAL STATUS; (III) STRENGTHEN THE RISK COVERAGE OF THE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, PARTICULARLY WITH

RESPECT TO COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK EXPOSURES ARISING FROM DERIVATIVES, REPOS AND SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES; (IV) INTRODUCE A LEVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD; AND (V) IMPLEMENT MEASURES TO PROMOTE THE BUILD-UP

OF CAPITAL BUFFERS IN GOOD TIMES THAT

38

CAN BE DRAWN UPON DURING PERIODS OF STRESS, INTRODUCING A COUNTERCYCLICAL COMPONENT DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN THAT EXISTING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE PROCYCLICAL  THAT IS, THEY

ENCOURAGE REDUCING CAPITAL BUFFERS IN GOOD TIMES, WHEN CAPITAL COULD MORE EASILY BE RAISED, AND INCREASING CAPITAL BUFFERS IN TIMES OF DISTRESS, WHEN ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS MAY BE LIMITED OR THEY MAY EFFECTIVELY BE CLOSED. THE CAPITAL PROPOSALS

DO NOT SPECIFY A PERCENTAGE FOR THE NEW RATIO OF COMMON EQUITY TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OR CHANGES IN THE CURRENT MINIMUM TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TOTAL CAPITAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH CURRENTLY ARE 4% AND 8%, RESPECTIVELY. INSTEAD,

THEY STATE THAT THE MINIMUM PERCENTAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEW RATIO OF COMMON EQUITY TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND THE OTHER CAPITAL RATIOSINCLUDING TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND THE NEW

LEVERAGE RATIOWILL BE INCLUDED IN A FULLY CALIBRATED, COMPREHENSIVE SET OF CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY PROPOSALS TO BE RELEASED BY DECEMBER 31, 2010. INDEPENDENTLY, IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY ISSUED A POLICY

STATEMENT TITLED PRINCIPLES FOR REFORMING THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY CAPITAL FRAMEWORK FOR BANKING FIRMS SETTING FORTH CORE PRINCIPLES INTENDED TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE SAME SUBSTANTIVE ITEMS AS THE BASEL COMMITTEE CAPITAL

PROPOSALS AND SPECIFICALLY CALLING FOR INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND SUBSTANTIALLY HEIGHTENED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

IF IMPLEMENTED, THE BASEL COMMITTEES LIQUIDITY PROPOSALS, ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY SIMILAR IN MANY RESPECTS TO TESTS HISTORICALLY APPLIED

BY BANKING ORGANIZATIONS AND REGULATORS FOR MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORY PURPOSES, WOULD FOR THE FIRST TIME BE FORMULAIC AND REQUIRED BY REGULATION. THEY WOULD IMPOSE TWO MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY RISK EXPOSURE, ONE BASED ON A 30-DAY TIME HORIZON AND THE

OTHER ADDRESSING LONGER-TERM STRUCTURAL LIQUIDITY MISMATCHES OVER A ONE-YEAR TIME PERIOD.

THE BASEL COMMITTEE INDICATED THAT

IT EXPECTS FINAL PROVISIONS RESPONSIVE TO THE PROPOSALS TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY DECEMBER 31, 2012. ULTIMATE IMPLEMENTATION IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE BANK REGULATORS IN THOSE

COUNTRIES. THE BASEL COMMITTEES FINAL PROPOSALS MAY DIFFER FROM THE PROPOSALS RELEASED IN DECEMBER 2009, AND THE REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES ADOPTED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE COMPANY AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY DIFFER

FROM THE FINAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE. MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH SOME ASPECTS OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE PROPOSALS WERE QUITE SPECIFIC (E.G., THE DEFINITION OF THE COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL), OTHERS WERE MERELY CONCEPTUAL (E.G., THE DESCRIPTION OF THE

LEVERAGE TEST) AND OTHERS NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED (E.G., THE MINIMUM PERCENTAGES FOR REQUIRED CAPITAL RATIOS). WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT AT THIS TIME THE CONTENT OF GUIDELINES OR REGULATIONS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE ADOPTED BY REGULATORY AGENCIES

HAVING AUTHORITY OVER THE COMPANY AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REGULATION UPON US. HOWEVER, A REQUIREMENT THAT THE COMPANY AND OUR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAIN MORE CAPITAL, WITH COMMON

EQUITY AS A MORE PREDOMINANT COMPONENT, OR MANAGE THE CONFIGURATION OF THEIR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH FORMULAIC LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR RETURN ON EQUITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATIONS, CAPITAL

POSITION AND ABILITY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

THE FDIA REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS TAKE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION IN RESPECT OF FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY

INSTITUTIONS THAT DO NOT MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE FDIA SPECIFIES FIVE CAPITAL TIERS: WELL CAPITALIZED, ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, UNDERCAPITALIZED, SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED, AND

CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CAPITAL TIER WILL DEPEND UPON HOW ITS CAPITAL LEVELS COMPARE TO VARIOUS RELEVANT CAPITAL MEASURES AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS, AS ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION. A BANK MAY BE DEEMED

TO BE IN A CAPITALIZATION CATEGORY THAT IS LOWER THAN IS INDICATED BY ITS ACTUAL CAPITAL POSITION IF IT RECEIVES AN UNSATISFACTORY EXAMINATION RATING. ONCE AN INSTITUTION BECOMES UNDERCAPITALIZED, THE FDIA IMPOSES PROGRESSIVELY MORE

RESTRICTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE CAPITAL CATEGORY IN WHICH AN INSTITUTION IS CLASSIFIED. A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION THAT IS NOT WELL CAPITALIZED IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON

BROKERED DEPOSITS AND CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT REGISTRY SERVICE DEPOSITS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS HAVE TO DATE BEEN RAISED THROUGH BROKER CHANNELS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR DEPOSIT PROGRAMS, PLEASE SEE

DEPOSIT PROGRAMS BEGINNING ON PAGE 23 ABOVE AND DEPOSIT PROGRAMS ON PAGE 42 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS AN FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FROM MAKING ANY CAPITAL

DISTRIBUTION (INCLUDING PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS) OR PAYING ANY MANAGEMENT FEE TO ITS HOLDING COMPANY IF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD THEREAFTER BE UNDERCAPITALIZED. UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON BORROWING

FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND TO GROWTH LIMITATIONS, AND ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN. FOR A CAPITAL RESTORATION PLAN TO BE ACCEPTABLE, ANY HOLDING COMPANY MUST GUARANTEE THE CAPITAL PLAN UP TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF 5%

OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS AT THE TIME IT BECAME UNDERCAPITALIZED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL DEFICIENCY AT THE TIME IT FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE PLAN. IN THE EVENT OF THE HOLDING COMPANYS BANKRUPTCY, SUCH GUARANTEE WOULD

TAKE PRIORITY OVER CLAIMS OF ITS GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS. IF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FAILS TO SUBMIT AN ACCEPTABLE PLAN, IT IS TREATED AS IF IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED.

SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING ORDERS TO SELL

SUFFICIENT VOTING STOCK TO BECOME ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED, REQUIREMENTS TO REDUCE TOTAL ASSETS AND CESSATION OF RECEIPT OF DEPOSITS FROM CORRESPONDENT BANKS. CRITICALLY UNDERCAPITALIZED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER

OR CONSERVATOR.

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANY AND TRS AS WELL AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE LIMITED BY BANKING STATUTES AND REGULATIONS IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN GENERAL, FEDERAL AND APPLICABLE STATE BANK LAWS PROHIBIT,

WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL, INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, FROM MAKING DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS IF SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT PAID OUT OF AVAILABLE RECENT EARNINGS OR WOULD CAUSE THE INSTITUTION TO

FAIL TO MEET CAPITAL ADEQUACY STANDARDS. IN ADDITION TO SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS ON THE DIVIDENDS THAT SUBSIDIARY BANKS CAN PAY TO THEIR HOLDING COMPANIES, FEDERAL REGULATORS COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING

PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

IT IS FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY THAT BANK HOLDING

COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY PAY TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND ONLY IF THE PROSPECTIVE RATE OF EARNINGS RETENTION APPEARS CONSISTENT WITH THE

ORGANIZATIONS CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY, AND OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN DIVIDEND LEVELS THAT PLACE UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE CAPITAL OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION

SUBSIDIARIES OR THAT MAY UNDERMINE THE BANK HOLDING COMPANYS ABILITY TO BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARIES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND BY THE COMPANY OR TRS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING

PRACTICE IN LIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION.

TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB

AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING LOANS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS FROM CENTURION BANK AND

AEBFSB) BETWEEN CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THEIR AFFILIATES (INCLUDING THE COMPANY, TRS AND THEIR NON-BANK SUBSIDIARIES), ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE SUBJECT TO QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE LIMITATIONS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS, AND

OTHER RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY STATUTE AND FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION. TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS. THESE RESTRICTIONS GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN A

DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

FDIC INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ACCEPT DEPOSITS, AND THOSE DEPOSITS ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC UP TO THE APPLICABLE LIMITS. THE FDICS DEPOSIT

INSURANCE FUND IS FUNDED BY ASSESSMENTS ON INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, WHICH DEPEND ON THE RISK CATEGORY OF AN INSTITUTION AND THE AMOUNT OF INSURED DEPOSITS THAT THE INSTITUTION HOLDS. THE FDIC MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE THE ASSESSMENT RATE

SCHEDULE ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS. FURTHERMORE,

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSESSMENT RATES ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS BASED UPON THE INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS RATIO OF (1) LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT TO DOMESTIC DEPOSITS, (2) SECURED LIABILITIES TO

DOMESTIC DEPOSITS, AND (3) BROKERED DEPOSITS TO DOMESTIC DEPOSITS (IF GREATER THAN 10%).

AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO

REBUILD THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND, THE FDIC ADOPTED A RULE IMPOSING A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT OF FIVE BASIS POINTS ON EACH FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS ASSETS, MINUS ITS TIER 1 CAPITAL, AS OF JUNE 30, 2009. THIS SPECIAL ASSESSMENT WAS

COLLECTED ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2009. ADDITIONALLY, ALSO AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO REBUILD THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND, THE FDIC REQUIRED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, TO PREPAY THEIR ESTIMATED ASSESSMENTS FOR

ALL OF 2010, 2011 AND 2012 ON DECEMBER 30, 2009. THE PREPAID ASSESSMENT AMOUNT FOR OUR INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $95.2 MILLION, $6.7 MILLION OF WHICH WAS RECORDED AS AN EXPENSE FOR INCOME STATEMENT

PURPOSES IN 2009 AND $88.5 MILLION OF WHICH WAS RECORDED AS A PREPAID EXPENSE FOR BALANCE SHEET PURPOSES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. ALSO AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO REBUILD THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND, THE FDIC RECENTLY ADOPTED A RULE IMPLEMENTING A

UNIFORM INCREASE OF THREE BASIS POINTS FOR ASSESSMENT RATES, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011.

UNDER THE FDIA, THE FDIC MAY

TERMINATE THE INSURANCE OF AN INSTITUTIONS DEPOSITS UPON A FINDING THAT THE INSTITUTION HAS ENGAGED IN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND PRACTICES, IS IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND CONDITION TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS OR HAS VIOLATED ANY APPLICABLE LAW, REGULATION,

RULE, ORDER OR CONDITION IMPOSED BY THE FDIC. WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY PRACTICE, CONDITION OR VIOLATION THAT MIGHT LEAD TO TERMINATION OF OUR DEPOSIT INSURANCE.

FDIC POWERS UPON INSOLVENCY OF INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

IF THE FDIC

IS APPOINTED THE CONSERVATOR OR RECEIVER OF AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB, UPON ITS INSOLVENCY OR IN CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS, THE FDIC HAS THE POWER: (1) TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO A NEW OBLIGOR WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CREDITORS; (2) TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO THEIR TERMS; OR (3) TO REPUDIATE OR DISAFFIRM

ANY CONTRACT OR LEASE TO WHICH THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS A PARTY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO BE BURDENSOME AND THE DISAFFIRMATION OR REPUDIATION OF WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE FDIC TO PROMOTE THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION

OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

IN ADDITION, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF U.S. DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AND

CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AGAINST AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WOULD BE AFFORDED A PRIORITY OVER OTHER GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS AGAINST THE INSTITUTION, INCLUDING CLAIMS OF DEBT HOLDERS OF THE INSTITUTION AND DEPOSITORS IN

NON-U.S. OFFICES, IN THE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER RESOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTION BY A RECEIVER. AS A RESULT, WHETHER OR NOT THE FDIC EVER SOUGHT TO REPUDIATE ANY DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CENTURION BANK OR AEBFSB, THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY

FROM, AND COULD RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS, IF ANYTHING, THAN THE DEPOSITORS IN U.S. OFFICES OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION.

CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISIONS

UNDER THE CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

REFORM, RECOVERY AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989 (FIRREA), INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB, MAY BE LIABLE TO THE FDIC WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOSS INCURRED OR REASONABLY ANTICIPATED TO BE INCURRED BY THE FDIC

IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFAULT OF, OR FDIC ASSISTANCE TO, ANY COMMONLY CONTROLLED INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE COMMONLY CONTROLLED WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FIRREA CROSS-GUARANTEE PROVISION.

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT

CENTURION BANK AND AEBFSB ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CRA, THE PRIMARY FEDERAL REGULATOR OF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION IS

REQUIRED, IN CONNECTION WITH ITS EXAMINATION OF THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, TO ASSESS SUCH DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS RECORD IN MEETING THE CREDIT NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY THAT DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, INCLUDING LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME

NEIGHBORHOODS. FURTHERMORE, SUCH ASSESSMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED OF ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION THAT HAS APPLIED TO,

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMONG OTHER THINGS, MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH OR ACQUIRE THE ASSETS OR ASSUME THE LIABILITIES OF A FEDERALLY REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OR TO OPEN OR RELOCATE A BRANCH OFFICE. IN THE CASE OF

A BANK HOLDING COMPANY APPLYING FOR APPROVAL TO ACQUIRE A BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL ASSESS THE RECORD OF EACH SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICANT BANK HOLDING COMPANY IN CONSIDERING THE APPLICATION. IN

ADDITION, AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY, THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY CRA RATINGS COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANYS AND TRS ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES IN RELIANCE

ON FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AUTHORITY.

PRIVACY AND FAIR CREDIT REPORTING

WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP AND MAKE AVAILABLE RELEVANT, PERSONALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE

GIVEN CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THEIR INFORMATION, AND WE GIVE THEM NOTICE REGARDING THE MEASURES WE TAKE TO SAFEGUARD THIS INFORMATION. REGULATORY ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY CONTINUES TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE,

SPURRED BY ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT THE RAPID AND WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION AND USE OF INFORMATION. AS NOTED ABOVE, AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO ENHANCE PAYMENT ACCOUNT DATA SECURITY, IN 2006, WE AND SEVERAL OTHER PAYMENT

CARD NETWORKS FORMED PCI SSC, AN INDEPENDENT STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE THE EVOLUTION OF THE PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD, WHICH HELPS ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROCESS CARD PAYMENTS TO PREVENT CREDIT/CHARGE CARD SECURITY BREACHES AND FRAUD

THROUGH INCREASED CONTROLS AROUND DATA AND ITS EXPOSURE TO COMPROMISE.

THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) BECAME

EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2001. GLBA REQUIRES CONSUMER NOTICE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIVACY POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND AFFORDS CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL

INFORMATION TO UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS). THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT PREEMPT STATE LAWS THAT AFFORD GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS, AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE ADOPTED SUCH LEGISLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2003 CALIFORNIA

ENACTED THAT STATES FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT. AS NOTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FCRA, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PLACES RESTRICTIONS (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) ON THE SHARING AND USE OF CERTAIN PERSONAL

FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WITH AND BY OUR AFFILIATES.

IN ADDITION, VARIOUS FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES,

AND AS MANY AS 45 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO, AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAVE ENACTED SECURITY BREACH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. DATA BREACH LAWS ARE

ALSO BECOMING MORE PREVALENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE OPERATE, INCLUDING JAPAN, MEXICO AND GERMANY. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE YET TO IMPOSE AUTOMATIC DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT

OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE DATA BREACHES.

BEYOND THESE DATA BREACH LAWS, A GROWING NUMBER OF STATES, INCLUDING MASSACHUSETTS AND NEVADA, HAVE ADOPTED BROAD-RANGING DATA SECURITY REGULATIONS REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE DATA

THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN 1995, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND ON THE

FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT

PERSONAL DATA.

WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE DATA ENTRUSTED TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND OUR

INTERNAL DATA PROTECTION POLICIES, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR IDENTITY THEFT, WHILE SEEKING TO COLLECT AND USE DATA PROPERLY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.

IN MAY 2009, THE CARD ACT WAS ENACTED TO PROHIBIT CERTAIN PRACTICES FOR CONSUMER CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS. THE CARD ACT, AMONG OTHER

REQUIREMENTS, PROHIBITS ISSUERS FROM TREATING A PAYMENT AS LATE FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING INCREASING THE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE OR IMPOSING A FEE, UNLESS A CONSUMER HAS BEEN PROVIDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO MAKE THE PAYMENT. IT

ALSO REQUIRES ISSUERS TO APPLY PAYMENT AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM PAYMENT FIRST TO THE BALANCE WITH THE HIGHEST APR AND THEN TO BALANCES WITH LOWER APRS. IN

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADDITION, THE ACT PROHIBITS AN ISSUER FROM INCREASING THE APR ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES, EXCEPT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN A PROMOTIONAL RATE EXPIRES, A VARIABLE RATE ADJUSTS, OR AN

ACCOUNT IS SERIOUSLY DELINQUENT OR COMPLETES A WORKOUT ARRANGEMENT. THESE REQUIREMENTS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON FEBRUARY 22, 2010.

ALSO, BEGINNING ON FEBRUARY 22, 2010, ISSUERS MUST MAINTAIN REASONABLE WRITTEN POLICIES TO CONSIDER A CONSUMERS INCOME OR ASSETS AND CURRENT OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO OPENING AN ACCOUNT OR INCREASING A CREDIT LINE. THIS MAY REQUIRE

ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR ACCOUNT OPENING DECISIONING AND LINE INCREASE DECISIONING PROCESSES. THIS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THESE DECISIONS  IF ANYTHING IT COULD RESULT IN FEWER APPLICATIONS FOR NEW ACCOUNTS BEING ACCEPTED

OR FEWER REQUESTS FOR LINE INCREASES BEING APPROVED. IN ADDITION, APPLICANTS FOR NEW ACCOUNTS WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 21 MUST DEMONSTRATE AN INDEPENDENT ABILITY TO MAKE THE REQUIRED MINIMUM PERIODIC PAYMENTS. THIS MAY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF

APPLICATIONS THAT ARE APPROVED FOR APPLICANTS UNDER THE AGE OF 21.

THE ACT ALSO REQUIRES THAT PENALTY FEES BE REASONABLE AND

PROPORTIONAL, AND THAT ISSUERS REVIEW RECENT APR INCREASES PERIODICALLY TO DETERMINE IF A DECREASE IS APPROPRIATE. THESE PROVISIONS BECOME EFFECTIVE ON AUGUST 22, 2010. SINCE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS NOT YET PUBLISHED FINAL RULES IMPLEMENTING

THESE PROVISIONS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE ON OUR OPERATIONS.

THE FEDERAL

RESERVE ALSO AMENDED ITS RULES ON THE FORMAT AND CONTENT OF CONSUMER CREDIT CARD DISCLOSURES. THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE REVISIONS TO THE FORMAT AND CONTENT OF ALL MAIN TYPES OF OPEN-END CONSUMER CREDIT DISCLOSURES, INCLUDING APPLICATIONS AND

SOLICITATIONS, ACCOUNT-OPENING DISCLOSURES, AND PERIODIC BILLING STATEMENTS. THESE AMENDMENTS BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2010. WHILE THE COMPANY IS MAKING CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS PRODUCT TERMS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE

IMPACT OF THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY THE CARD ACT, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE CARD ACT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES AND REVENUES WILL DEPEND UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY

TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS STRATEGIES, CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND THE ACTIONS OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AT THIS TIME. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY THE CARD

ACT, IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT OF 1970

(FCRA) REGULATES THE DISCLOSURE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS BY CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND THE USE OF CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION BY BANKS AND OTHER COMPANIES. FCRA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED BY THE ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2003 OF

THE FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT (THE FACT ACT). THE FACT ACT REQUIRES ANY COMPANY THAT RECEIVES INFORMATION CONCERNING A CONSUMER FROM AN AFFILIATE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO PERMIT THE CONSUMER TO OPT OUT FROM

HAVING THAT INFORMATION USED TO MARKET THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ISSUED A FINAL RULE IMPLEMENTING THE AFFILIATE MARKETING PROVISIONS OF THE FACT ACT. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY

THESE AGENCIES WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES BY OCTOBER 1, 2008. WE QUALIFY FOR AN EXCEPTION FROM THE AFFILIATE MARKETING PROVISIONS OF THE FACT ACT, AND AS A RESULT, WE DO NOT NEED TO PROVIDE AN AFFILIATE MARKETING OPT OUT. THE FACT

ACT FURTHER AMENDS THE FCRA BY ADDING SEVERAL NEW PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT OR DECREASE IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CONSUMER CREDIT INFORMATION. THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES AND THE FTC PUBLISHED A FINAL RULE IN NOVEMBER 2007

REQUIRING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM CONTAINING REASONABLE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS THE RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT AND TO IDENTIFY ACCOUNTS WHERE IDENTITY THEFT IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE

FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES ORIGINALLY WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE BY NOVEMBER 1, 2008, BUT THE FTC HAS STATED IT WILL SUSPEND ENFORCEMENT OF ITS RULE UNTIL JUNE 1, 2010. TRS CONTINUES TO BE REGULATED BY THE FTC WITH RESPECT TO THIS NEW

RULE AND IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING WHAT STEPS IT WILL NEED TO TAKE TO COMPLY. THE FACT ACT ALSO IMPOSES NEW DUTIES ON BOTH CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND ON BUSINESSES THAT FURNISH OR USE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE,

A FURNISHER OF INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO PREVENT THE REPORTING OF ANY INFORMATION THAT IT LEARNS IS THE RESULT OF IDENTITY THEFT. ALSO, IF A CONSUMER DISPUTES THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING

AGENCY, THE FURNISHER OF THAT INFORMATION MUST CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND RESPOND TO THE CONSUMER IN A TIMELY FASHION. THE FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH FURNISHERS OF

INFORMATION WOULD BE

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE DISPUTES REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE FACT ACT ALSO REQUIRES GRANTORS OF CREDIT THAT USE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT

INFORMATION IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO OFFER A BORROWER CREDIT ON TERMS THAT ARE MATERIALLY LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE TERMS OFFERED TO MOST OF THE LENDERS OTHER CUSTOMERS TO NOTIFY THE BORROWER THAT THE TERMS ARE BASED ON A

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. IN SUCH A CASE THE BORROWER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF THE REPORT FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY. THE FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FTC HAVE ISSUED RULES THAT SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH

RISK-BASED PRICING NOTICES MUST BE PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS AND THE CONTENT, FORMAT AND TIMING OF SUCH NOTICES. GRANTORS OF CREDIT USING PRESCREENED CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION IN CREDIT SOLICITATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO INCLUDE AN

ENHANCED NOTICE TO CONSUMERS THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT FROM RECEIVING FURTHER PRESCREENED OFFERS OF CREDIT. THE ENACTMENT OF THE FACT ACT AND THE PROMULGATION OF RULES IMPLEMENTING IT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESS OR PRACTICES.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE USA PATRIOT ACT WAS ENACTED IN OCTOBER 2001 IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS. THE

PATRIOT ACT, IN ADDITION TO SUBSTANTIALLY BROADENING EXISTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) AND TERRORIST FINANCING LEGISLATION, AMENDED THE BANK SECRECY ACT, THE PRIMARY LEGISLATION GOVERNING AML REQUIREMENTS. THE PATRIOT ACT CONTAINS A

WIDE VARIETY OF PROVISIONS AIMED AT FIGHTING TERRORISM AND MONEY LAUNDERING, INCLUDING PROVISIONS AIMED AT IMPEDING TERRORISTS ABILITY TO ACCESS AND MOVE FUNDS USED IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BANK SECRECY ACT,

AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH AML PROGRAMS THAT MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, EXPANDED REPORTING AND ENHANCED INFORMATION GATHERING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS. WHILE AMERICAN

EXPRESS HAS LONG MAINTAINED AML PROGRAMS IN OUR BUSINESSES, CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC AML REGULATIONS THAT PRESCRIBE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR COMPONENTS OF THE AML PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR GNS BUSINESS MAINTAINS A

RISK-BASED PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LICENSED TO ISSUE CARDS OR ACQUIRE MERCHANTS ON THEIR NETWORKS MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AML CONTROLS. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER, OR DUE DILIGENCE, PROGRAM AND AN

ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE PROGRAM, INCLUDING A PROGRAM FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS (CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM) FOR APPLICABLE BUSINESSES. WE WILL TAKE STEPS TO COMPLY WITH ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS OR INITIATIVES THAT

ARE ADOPTED, WHETHER IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

YEARS, THE INDUSTRY HAS SEEN INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF THE AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WITH EMPHASIS ON RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THE REQUIREMENT TO IDENTIFY AND REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY,

LEADING TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. TO MEET THIS INCREASED SCRUTINY, WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. OUR AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF RISK-BASED POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS THAT

ARE REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT, DETECT AND REPORT MONEY LAUNDERING.

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION,

INCLUDING A NUMBER OF REGULATED BUSINESSES. WE MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN EU LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS IN THE OTHER MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING EUROPEAN

UNION DIRECTIVES APPLICABLE TO PAYMENT INSTITUTIONS, CREDIT PROVIDERS, INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

COMPENSATION PRACTICES

OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IN

OCTOBER 2009, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ISSUED A COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES THAT APPLIES TO ALL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SUCH AS AMERICAN EXPRESS. THE PROPOSAL

SETS FORTH THREE KEY PRINCIPLES FOR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE THAT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS DO NOT ENCOURAGE EXCESSIVE RISK-TAKING AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF BANKING

ORGANIZATIONS. THE THREE PRINCIPLES PROVIDE THAT A BANKING ORGANIZATIONS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD PROVIDE INCENTIVES THAT DO NOT ENCOURAGE RISK-TAKING BEYOND THE

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ORGANIZATIONS ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY AND MANAGE RISKS, BE COMPATIBLE WITH EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT, AND BE SUPPORTED BY STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. ANY

DEFICIENCIES IN COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF A BANKING INSTITUTION THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN CONNECTION WITH ITS REVIEW OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS COMPENSATION PRACTICES MAY BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS SUPERVISORY

RATINGS, WHICH CAN AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR PERFORM OTHER ACTIONS. THE PROPOSAL PROVIDES THAT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST A BANKING ORGANIZATION IF ITS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATED RISK-MANAGEMENT

CONTROL OR GOVERNANCE PROCESSES POSE A RISK TO THE ORGANIZATIONS SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS AND THE ORGANIZATION IS NOT TAKING PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO CORRECT THE DEFICIENCIES. SEPARATELY, THE FDIC HAS SOLICITED COMMENTS ON WHETHER TO AMEND

ITS RISK-BASED DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM TO POTENTIALLY INCREASE ASSESSMENT RATES ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH COMPENSATION PROGRAMS THAT PUT THE FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND AT RISK, AND PROPOSED LEGISLATION WOULD SUBJECT COMPENSATION

PRACTICES AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO HEIGHTENED STANDARDS AND INCREASED SCRUTINY.

THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE U.S. BANKING

REGULATORS POLICIES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE EVOLVING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME WHETHER COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH POLICIES WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF

AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO HIRE, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE ITS AND THEIR KEY EMPLOYEES.

FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES

ACT

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. LAWS GOVERNING THE ACTIVITIES OF U.S. COMPANIES TRANSACTING BUSINESS

ABROAD, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (THE FCPA). THE FCPA PROHIBITS U.S. COMPANIES FROM MAKING IMPROPER PAYMENTS, OR OFFERS OF PAYMENTS, TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL PARTIES FOR THE PURPOSE

OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING BUSINESS. THE FCPA ALSO REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, WHICH ARE ENFORCED BY THE SEC. VIOLATIONS OF THE FCPA MAY RESULT IN SEVERE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL SANCTIONS AND OTHER PENALTIES. WE HAVE

IMPLEMENTED SAFEGUARDS TO DETER PROHIBITED PRACTICES; HOWEVER, IF OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS GOVERNING OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, WE MAY FACE INVESTIGATIONS OR PROSECUTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM THE USE OF OUR CARD PRODUCTS, TRAVELERS CHEQUES, TRAVEL AND OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. (FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION, SEE NOTE 25 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON PAGES 122-124 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.) OUR REVENUES CAN BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE

AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT BY THE LOCAL CARD ISSUER OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS SPENDING OUTSIDE SUCH COUNTRY, FOR THE PAYMENT OF CARD BILLS BY CARDMEMBERS WHO ARE BILLED IN OTHER THAN THEIR LOCAL

CURRENCY, AND FOR THE REMITTANCE OF THE PROCEEDS OF TRAVELERS CHEQUE SALES). SUBSTANTIAL AND SUDDEN DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CARDMEMBERS CURRENCY CAN ALSO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE LOCAL ISSUER OF THE CARD IN CONNECTION WITH

SPENDING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL COUNTRY.

AS A RESULT OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT, BECAUSE OF

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR MAY BE REALIZED IN AMOUNTS GREATER OR LESS THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THIS MAY OCCUR INCLUDE THE PURCHASE BY CARDMEMBERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE CURRENCY IN WHICH THEY ARE BILLED; THE SALE IN ONE CURRENCY OF A TRAVELERS CHEQUE

DENOMINATED IN A SECOND CURRENCY; AND, IN MOST INSTANCES, INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE RISKS, UNLESS PROPERLY MONITORED AND MANAGED, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOW WE MANAGE RISK RELATING TO

FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SEE RISK MANAGEMENTMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS ON PAGES 47-49 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

SALE OF AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK LTD. / DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2007, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL OUR INTERNATIONAL BANKING SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS

BANK LTD. (AEBL), TO STANDARD CHARTERED PLC (STANDARD CHARTERED), AND TO SELL AMERICAN EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL DEPOSIT COMPANY (AEIDC) THROUGH A PUT/CALL AGREEMENT TO STANDARD CHARTERED 18 MONTHS AFTER THE CLOSE OF

THE AEBL SALE. THE SALE OF AEBL WAS COMPLETED ON FEBRUARY 29, 2008. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, AEIDC QUALIFIED TO BE REPORTED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION AND THE SALE OF AEIDC WAS COMPLETED ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2009.

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, ALL OF THE OPERATING RESULTS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND CASH FLOWS OF AEBL (EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF

AEBL THAT WERE NOT SOLD) AND AEIDC HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CORPORATE & OTHER SEGMENT AND ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

RECEIVABLES AND/OR PLACING THE CARDMEMBER ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN NOT EXCEEDING 60 MONTHS. IF THE CARDMEMBER DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE MODIFIED TERMS, THEN THE LOAN OR RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT REVERTS BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL TERMS. IN ADDITION TO TDRS, THE

COMPANY HAS INSTITUTED OTHER MODIFICATION PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE SHORT-TERM (12 MONTHS OR LESS) INTEREST RATE AND FEE REDUCTIONS TO CARDMEMBERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY (SHORT TERM MODIFICATION PROGRAMS). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007, APPROXIMATELY $701 MILLION, $497 MILLION AND $0, RESPECTIVELY, IN CARDMEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES HAVE BEEN MODIFIED UNDER THESE SHORT TERM MODIFICATION PROGRAMS AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCHEDULE ABOVE,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS

CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE IS BASED UPON THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCILS (FFIEC) GUIDELINES GOVERNING

THE DETERMINATION OF CROSS-BORDER RISK. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE FFIEC GUIDELINES FOR ITS CROSS-BORDER DISCLOSURE STARTING WITH 2009 REPORTING. ACCORDINGLY, THE AMOUNTS FOR 2008 AND 2007 HAVE BEEN REVISED FROM THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS TO

CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FFIEC AND GUIDE 3 GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING

CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE ARE: I) AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE REPORTED BASED ON AMORTIZED COST FOR FFIEC INSTEAD OF FAIR VALUES FOR GUIDE 3; II) NET LOCAL COUNTRY CLAIMS ARE REDUCED BY LOCAL COUNTRY LIABILITIES (REGARDLESS OF CURRENCY

DENOMINATION) EXCLUDING ANY DEBT THAT IS FUNDING THE LOCAL ASSETS THROUGH A FOREIGN DOMICILED SUBSIDIARY FOR FFIEC COMPARED TO GUIDE 3 WHERE ONLY AMOUNTS IN THE SAME CURRENCIES ARE OFFSET AND SUCH DEBT NOTED ABOVE IS A REDUCTION TO LOCAL COUNTRY

CLAIMS; III) THE FFIEC METHODOLOGY INCLUDES MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURES OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS WHICH ARE EXCLUDED UNDER GUIDE 3; AND IV) INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE INCLUDED UNDER FFIEC BUT EXCLUDED UNDER GUIDE 3.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS FROM BORROWERS OR COUNTERPARTIES FOR EACH FOREIGN COUNTRY

THAT EXCEEDS 1 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS FOR ANY OF THE PERIODS REPORTED BELOW. CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS INCLUDE LOANS, RECEIVABLES, INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS WITH OTHER BANKS, OTHER INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS AND MONETARY ASSETS THAT

ARE DENOMINATED IN EITHER DOLLARS OR OTHER NON-LOCAL CURRENCY.

(B)

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY REVISED ITS METHOD OF REPORTING THE CARDMEMBER LENDING NET WRITE-OFF RATE. HISTORICALLY, THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE HAS BEEN

PRESENTED USING NET WRITE-OFF AMOUNTS FOR PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND FEES. HOWEVER, INDUSTRY CONVENTION IS GENERALLY TO INCLUDE ONLY THE NET WRITE-OFFS RELATED TO PRINCIPAL IN WRITE-OFF RATE DISCLOSURES. THE WRITE-OFF RATE FOR 2009, 2008 AND 2007 IS A

PRINCIPAL ONLY WRITE-OFF RATE CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY CONVENTION. THE WRITE-OFF RATE FOR 2006 AND 2005 REFLECTS PRINCIPAL ONLY WRITE-OFFS IN THE U.S. AND TOTAL WRITE-OFFS (PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, AND FEES) OUTSIDE THE U.S. AS PRINCIPAL ONLY WRITE-OFF

INFORMATION WAS NOT AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE U.S. FOR 2006 AND PRIOR PERIODS.

(C)

FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH (B) ABOVE, NET WRITE-OFFS WERE $2.9 BILLION, $2.6 BILLION, $1.6 BILLION, $1.2 BILLION

AND $985 MILLION FOR 2009-2005, RESPECTIVELY.

(D)

THE AMOUNT FOR 2009 PRIMARILY INCLUDES $160 MILLION OF RESERVES THAT WERE REMOVED IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATIONS DURING THE YEAR. THE OFFSET IS IN THE ALLOCATED

COST OF THE ASSOCIATED RETAINED SUBORDINATED SECURITIES. FOR 2008, THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES RECLASSIFICATION OF WAIVED FEE RESERVES TO CONTRA-CARDMEMBER LOANS. THIS AMOUNT, FOR ALL PERIODS, ALSO INCLUDES FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS.

AVERAGE CARDMEMBER LOANS ARE BASED ON MONTHLY BALANCES.

REFER TO NOTE 4 ON PAGE 80 IN THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF MANAGEMENTS PROCESS FOR EVALUATING ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

(B)

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY REVISED THE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH PAST DUE CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES IN U.S. CARD SERVICES ARE WRITTEN OFF TO 180 DAYS PAST

DUE, CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY GUIDANCE. PREVIOUSLY, RECEIVABLES WERE WRITTEN OFF WHEN 360 DAYS PAST BILLING. THE NET WRITE-OFFS FOR 2008 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $341 MILLION RESULTING FROM THIS WRITE-OFF METHODOLOGY CHANGE.

(C)

INCLUDES FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR ALL PERIODS. FOR 2008, THIS AMOUNT ALSO INCLUDED OTHER ADJUSTMENTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF

WAIVED FEE RESERVES TO A CONTRA-CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLE.

(D)

THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE PRESENTED IS ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS AND IS BASED ON WRITE-OFFS OF PRINCIPAL AND FEES. THE U.S. CARD SERVICES WRITE-OFF RATE WAS 3.8 PERCENT FOR

2009 AND 3.6 PERCENT FOR 2008 AND IS BASED ON PRINCIPAL-ONLY WRITE-OFFS. AVERAGES ARE BASED ON MONTHLY BALANCES. IF THE $341 MILLION REFERENCED IN (B) ABOVE HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN U.S. CARD SERVICES WRITE-OFFS, THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE WOULD HAVE

BEEN 5.4 PERCENT FOR 2008.

(E)

THE NET LOSS RATIO REPRESENTS THE WORLDWIDE RATIO OF CHARGE CARD WRITE-OFFS CONSISTING OF PRINCIPAL (RESULTING FROM AUTHORIZED AND UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS) AND FEE

COMPONENTS, LESS RECOVERIES, ON CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES EXPRESSED AS A PERCENT OF GROSS AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE DISCUSSED IN (B) ABOVE, THE COMPANY STOPPED CALCULATING THE WORLDWIDE NET LOSS RATIO BEGINNING IN

2008. THE NET LOSS RATIO FOR 2009 AND 2008 FOR INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES WAS 0.36 PERCENT AND 0.24 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY AND FOR GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES WAS 0.19 PERCENT AND 0.13 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

THIS

SECTION HIGHLIGHTS SPECIFIC RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESSES. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. BASED ON THE

INFORMATION CURRENTLY KNOWN TO US, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OUR COMPANY FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ADDITIONAL

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE TO BE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DEVELOPS INTO ACTUAL EVENTS OR IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR OR CONTINUE TO OCCUR, THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS

DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL

MARKETS AND ECONOMY GENERALLY, AS WELL AS POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY, BOTH IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD.

ONGOING CONCERNS OVER THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT, THE MORTGAGE AND REAL

ESTATE MARKETS, SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES, FEAR OF A DOUBLE-DIP RECESSION AND GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO UNCERTAIN EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE MARKETS GOING FORWARD. THESE FACTORS, COMBINED WITH STILL RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF

BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT, CONTINUE TO IMPACT GLOBAL ECONOMIES, WHICH HELPED DRIVE DECLINES IN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD USAGE AND ADVERSE CHANGES IN PAYMENT PATTERNS BY CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. IT IS UNCLEAR THE

DEGREE TO WHICH THE U.S. GOVERNMENTS ECONOMIC STIMULUS SPENDING WILL FOSTER ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2010. THIS ENVIRONMENT HAS HAD, AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE

VERY DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMER AND BUSINESS BEHAVIOR. IF THE ECONOMY WERE TO WORSEN, CUSTOMER BEHAVIORS COULD CHANGE FURTHER. FOR EXAMPLE, CARDMEMBERS COULD DECIDE TO REDEEM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS POINTS AT ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS TO REPLACE CASH

EXPENDITURES.

FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING, BUSINESS INVESTMENT, GOVERNMENT SPENDING, INTEREST RATES, THE VOLATILITY AND

STRENGTH OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND INFLATION ALL AFFECT THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, ULTIMATELY, OUR PROFITABILITY. AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, LOWER FAMILY INCOME, LOWER CORPORATE EARNINGS, LOWER

BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING IS LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE MAY CAUSE OUR EARNINGS, CREDIT METRICS AND MARGINS TO

FLUCTUATE AND DIVERGE FROM EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, WHO MAY HAVE DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THEIR IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, AND MAY IMPACT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES.

THE SCARCITY OF AVAILABLE CREDIT, LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, REDUCED CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SPENDING, AND CREDIT METRIC

PERFORMANCE ALSO POSE OTHER RISKS TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN PARTICULAR, WE MAY FACE THE FOLLOWING RISKS, AMONG OTHERS, IN CONNECTION WITH THESE EVENTS.



THE PROCESSES WE USE TO ESTIMATE LOSSES MAY NO LONGER BE RELIABLE BECAUSE THEY RELY ON COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING FORECASTS OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

THAT MAY NO LONGER BE CAPABLE OF ACCURATE ESTIMATION.



OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF THE MODELS AND APPROACHES WE USE TO SELECT, MANAGE, AND UNDERWRITE

CREDIT TO OUR CUSTOMERS BECOME LESS PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS.

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS



IN THE EVENT THE RESPECTIVE THREE-MONTH AVERAGE RATE OF EXCESS SPREAD EARNED ON CREDIT CARD LOANS AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES SECURITIZED BY US FALLS

BELOW CERTAIN DESIGNATED LEVELS, THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS ESTABLISHED BY US WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FUND A CASH RESERVE ACCOUNT (FROM CASH THAT WOULD NORMALLY REVERT BACK TO US THROUGH THE COLLECTION PROCESS), OR, IN THE EVENT SUCH THREE-MONTH AVERAGE

SHOULD FALL BELOW ZERO, THE SECURITIZATION TRUSTS ESTABLISHED BY US WOULD BE REQUIRED TO AMORTIZE EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED, WHICH WOULD ACCELERATE OUR NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OR COUNTRIES COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR COMMERCIAL OR OTHER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER

BUSINESSES, OR RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON CONVERTIBILITY OF CERTAIN CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, OUR TRAVEL NETWORK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WORLD GEOPOLITICAL AND OTHER CONDITIONS. TRAVEL EXPENDITURES ARE SENSITIVE TO BUSINESS AND PERSONAL

DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS AND TEND TO DECLINE DURING GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

TERRORIST ATTACKS, NATURAL DISASTERS OR

OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SIMILAR EVENTS OR OTHER

DISASTERS OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM TRAVEL-RELATED SPENDING, OUR BUSINESS

WILL BE SENSITIVE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, AND THUS IS LIKELY TO DECLINE DURING PERIODS IN WHICH TRAVELERS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES OR WHEN TRAVEL MIGHT INVOLVE HEALTH-RELATED RISKS.

IF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE (OR SIMILAR ONES) PERSIST OR WORSEN, WE COULD EXPERIENCE CONTINUING OR INCREASED ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL.

THE GLOBAL MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS, WHILE DEMONSTRATING

GENERALLY IMPROVED CONDITIONS, REMAIN SUSCEPTIBLE TO VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT MARKET LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS.

WE NEED LIQUIDITY TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST ON DEBT AND DIVIDENDS ON CAPITAL STOCK AND TO REPAY MATURING LIABILITIES. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WE COULD BE FORCED TO LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN

GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OR CURTAIL OPERATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY ARE PAYMENTS FROM CARDMEMBERS, CASH FLOW FROM OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ASSETS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF CASH OR ASSETS THAT ARE READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH,

DEPOSITS PLACED WITH THE COMPANYS U.S. BANKS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS UNSECURED MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM NOTES AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, AND LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITIES IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. MARKETS.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION, WE ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM PRESSURES EXPERIENCED BROADLY ACROSS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE

FRAGILITY OF THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HAVE IMPACTED FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES. ALTHOUGH THE MARKET FOR OUR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS HAS IMPROVED SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009,

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE MARKETS WILL BE OPEN TO US IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FOR UNSECURED TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON INVESTOR DEMAND. IN ADDITION, OUR

LIQUIDITY POSITION WILL BE IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES WITH RESPECT TO THE GROWTH OF OUR BROKERED RETAIL CD PROGRAM AND BROKERAGE SWEEP ACCOUNT PROGRAM AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR DIRECT DEPOSIT INITIATIVE. WE ALSO WOULD HAVE

LESS FLEXIBILITY IN ACCESSING THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AS A SHORT-TERM FUNDING VEHICLE DUE TO CREDCOS SHORT-TERM DEBT RATING AND THE VOLATILITY IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET GENERALLY.

IN THE EVENT THAT CURRENT SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING INTERNAL SOURCES, DO NOT SATISFY OUR NEEDS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SEEK

ADDITIONAL FINANCING. THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS MARKET CONDITIONS, THE GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AND CONSUMER DEPOSITS, THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INDUSTRY, OUR CREDIT RATINGS (WHICH WERE DOWNGRADED IN APRIL 2009 BY TWO OF THE MAJOR RATINGS AGENCIES), AND CREDIT CAPACITY, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT LENDERS OR DEPOSITORS COULD DEVELOP A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF OUR LONG- OR SHORT-TERM

FINANCIAL PROSPECTS IF WE INCUR LARGE CREDIT LOSSES OR IF THE LEVEL OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITY DECREASES DUE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SIMILARLY, OUR ACCESS TO FUNDS MAY BE IMPAIRED IF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR RATING AGENCIES

TAKE NEGATIVE ACTIONS AGAINST US. WHILE WE EXPERIENCED SOME POSITIVE CREDIT TRENDS IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2009, IF THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CHARGE CARD AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIOS WERE TO WEAKEN THROUGH INCREASING DELINQUENCIES AND WRITE-OFFS, OUR

LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS COULD BE FURTHER DOWNGRADED AND OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND OUR COST OF CAPITAL COULD INCREASE. DISRUPTIONS, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY

ALSO LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE, IN A TIMELY MANNER, MATURING LIABILITIES, SATISFY REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO GROW

OUR BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY RAISING CAPITAL OR BEAR AN UNATTRACTIVE COST TO RAISE CAPITAL, WHICH COULD DECREASE PROFITABILITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. IF LEVELS OF MARKET DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY WORSEN,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE EFFECT, WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL, ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING NEEDS, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEWFUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES ON PAGES

40-43 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

WE CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

THE IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ROUTINE FUNDING TRANSACTIONS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES INSTITUTIONS ARE INTERRELATED AS A RESULT OF TRADING, CLEARING, COUNTERPARTY OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE ROUTINELY EXECUTE

TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. DEFAULTS OR NON-PERFORMANCE BY, OR EVEN RUMORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT, ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL SERVICES

INSTITUTIONS, OR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, HAVE LED TO MARKET-WIDE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND COULD LEAD TO LOSSES OR DEFAULTS BY ONE OR MORE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ANY REDUCTION IN THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE THE

COST OF OUR FUNDING FROM, AND RESTRICT OUR ACCESS TO, THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM DEBT IS CURRENTLY RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES, THE RATINGS OF THAT DEBT HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED DURING THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2009 BY MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES (MOODYS) AND STANDARD & POORS (S&P), TWO OF THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES. THE RATING AGENCIES REGULARLY EVALUATE THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND

THEIR RATINGS OF THE COMPANYS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS WELL AS FACTORS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THEIR CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDITIONS AFFECTING

THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY GENERALLY, AND THE WIDER STATE OF THE ECONOMY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT RESPECTIVE RATINGS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THOSE RATINGS COULD, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, ADVERSELY LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COST AND OTHER TERMS UPON WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN FUNDING.

WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ACTIONS RATING AGENCIES MAY TAKE. AS WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, THE COMPANYS AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES RATINGS COULD BE DOWNGRADED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BY ANY OF THE RATING AGENCIES.

ADVERSE CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS COULD DECREASE REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

DURING

2009, OVER 32% OF OUR REVENUE NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE WAS GENERATED FROM ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND SOME OF THE REVENUE WE GENERATE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

IS SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE AND INDETERMINATE FLUCTUATIONS IF THE

69

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VALUES OF OTHER CURRENCIES CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. RESULTING EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR NET INCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL

REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT THE CONVERSION OF OUR OTHER REVENUE CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DECREASE THE REVENUES WE RECEIVE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS

THE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2009 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE CARD ACT REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO MANY OF

OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING MARKETING, UNDERWRITING, PRICING AND BILLING. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CARD ACT PROHIBITS AN ISSUER FROM INCREASING THE APR ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS), REQUIRES ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT

DISCLOSURES, PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ACCOUNT TERMS, AND RESTRICTS PENALTY FEES AND CHARGES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY AN ISSUER.

MOST OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CARD ACT BECOME EFFECTIVE IN FEBRUARY 2010. ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO REGULATION Z REVISING THE OPEN-END

CREDIT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2010. TWO PROVISIONS OF THE CARD ACT DO NOT COME INTO EFFECT UNTIL AUGUST 22, 2010. ONE OF THESE PROVISIONS ADDRESSES THE REASONABLENESS AND PROPORTIONALITY OF PENALTY FEES

CHARGED. THE OTHER PROVISION REQUIRES ISSUERS TO EVALUATE PAST INTEREST RATE INCREASES TWICE PER YEAR. THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THESE PROVISIONS, BUT HAS NOT YET DONE SO. BECAUSE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS ARE

NOT FINAL, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THESE TWO PROVISIONS. HOWEVER, THE REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THESE PROVISIONS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS.

WHILE THE COMPANY IS MAKING CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS PRODUCT TERMS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES

REQUIRED BY THE CARD ACT, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE CARD ACT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PRACTICES AND REVENUES WILL DEPEND UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY

IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS STRATEGIES, CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND THE ACTIONS OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AT THIS TIME. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY THE CARD ACT, IT WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REFORMS COULD, IF ENACTED OR ADOPTED,

RESULT IN OUR BUSINESS BECOMING SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AND EXTENSIVE ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE EXTREME DISRUPTIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS SINCE MID-2007 AND THE RESULTING INSTABILITY AND FAILURE OF NUMEROUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

HAVE LED TO NUMEROUS PROPOSALS FOR LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REFORM THAT COULD SUBSTANTIALLY INTENSIFY THE REGULATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND THAT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COMPANY. THESE PROPOSALS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



ESTABLISHING A FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGENCY THAT WOULD HAVE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BROAD AUTHORITY TO REGULATE, AND TAKE ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS AGAINST, PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS, PAYMENT AND OTHER CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.



REQUIRING HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY AND STRICTER REGULATION OF ANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHOSE COMBINATION OF SIZE, LEVERAGE AND INTERCONNECTEDNESS COULD

POSE A THREAT TO FINANCIAL STABILITY IF IT FAILED, RESTRICTING THE ACTIVITIES OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS, AND ALLOWING REGULATORS TO DISMANTLE LARGE OR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, EVEN HEALTHY ONES, IF THEY ARE CONSIDERED A

GRAVE RISK TO THE ECONOMY.

70

TABLE OF CONTENTS



REQUIRING LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING, AS PROPOSED, AMERICAN EXPRESS, TO CONTRIBUTE TO A FUND THAT WOULD BE USED TO RECOVER THE COST OF

DISMANTLING A BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT IS DISMANTLED BECAUSE IT POSES A GRAVE RISK TO THE ECONOMY.



CHANGING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SECURITIZATION MARKET, INCLUDING REQUIRING SPONSORS OF SECURITIZATIONS TO RETAIN A MATERIAL ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDERLYING SECURITIZATION, AS WELL AS ENHANCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSET SECURITIZATIONS.



TIGHTENING CONTROLS ON THE ABILITY OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.



ASSESSING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH OVER $50 BILLION IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, INCLUDING, AS PROPOSED, AMERICAN EXPRESS, WITH A FINANCIAL CRISIS

RESPONSIBILITY FEE ASSESSED AT APPROXIMATELY 0.15% OF TOTAL ASSETS (LESS TIER 1 CAPITAL AND LESS FDIC-ASSESSED DEPOSITS). THE FEE AS PROPOSED WOULD LAST FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECOVERING

PROJECTED LOSSES FROM THE TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM.



LIMITING THE SIZE AND ACTIVITIES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING PROPOSALS TO REPEAL PORTIONS OF THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT.



AMENDING REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS, AND INCREASING REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, FOR BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING AMERICAN

EXPRESS AND ITS INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES, AND ESTABLISHING NEW FORMULAIC LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE PROPOSALS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONPROPOSED

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ON PAGES 38-39.



ESTABLISHING HEIGHTENED STANDARDS FOR AND INCREASED SCRUTINY OF COMPENSATION POLICIES AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE PROPOSALS DESCRIBED

ABOVE UNDER SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONSCOMPENSATION PRACTICES ON PAGES 44-45.

LAWMAKERS

AND REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER THESE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER WIDE-RANGING AND COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSALS FOR ALTERING THE STRUCTURE, REGULATION AND COMPETITIVE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE NATIONS FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, SEPARATE COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL REFORM BILLS WERE INTRODUCED IN BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2009, AND THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED A FINANCIAL REFORM BILL IN DECEMBER OF 2009, BUT SIMILAR

ACTION HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN BY THE U.S. SENATE.

IN ADDITION TO PROPOSED LEGISLATION EFFECTING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY,

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY OTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTION OR INACTION, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FAILURE OF THE U.S. CONGRESS TO EXTEND THE ACTIVE FINANCING EXCEPTION TO SUBPART F OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, WHICH COULD

INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR NET INCOME.

WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FINAL FORM, OR EFFECTS ON

AMERICAN EXPRESS, OF THESE OR OTHER POTENTIAL OR PROPOSED REFORMS. THESE AND OTHER POTENTIAL OR PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES COULD IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE CERTAIN OF ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES OR ALTER ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, AFFECT RETENTION OF KEY COMPANY PERSONNEL, OR EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO ADDITIONAL COSTS (INCLUDING INCREASED COMPLIANCE

COSTS). SUCH CHANGES ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

PLEASE SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION ON PAGES

35-45 FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATION TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT.

POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THE FDIC AND THE RATING AGENCIES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANYS ABS PROGRAM.

THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ARE ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR TRANSFERS OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FOR CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS) ON CREDIT RATINGS OF THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY SECURITIZATION TRUSTS WITHIN THE OVERALL ASSET-BACKED

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SECURITIES MARKET. (THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, PREVIOUSLY ISSUED AS FASB STATEMENTS NOS. 166 AND 167, ARE DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH YOU CAN

FIND ON PAGE 76 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.) IN PARTICULAR, THE AGENCIES ARE ASSESSING THE FDICS SAFE HARBOR RULE RELATING TO THE FDICS TREATMENT OF SECURITIZED ASSETS IN THE

EVENT OF A SPONSORING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS RECEIVERSHIP OR CONSERVATORSHIP. PURSUANT TO THE SAFE HARBOR RULE, THE FDIC WILL NOT RECLAIM ANY FINANCIAL ASSET TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION WITH A SECURITIZATION, PROVIDED THAT SUCH TRANSFER MEETS

ALL CONDITIONS FOR GAAP SALE ACCOUNTING. ALTHOUGH THE FDIC EXTENDED, ON AN INTERIM BASIS, THE SAFE HARBOR RULE TO SOME TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH SECURITIZATIONS WHERE THE TRANSFER WILL NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR SALE ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT UNDER GAAP AS A RESULT OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT HOW THE FDIC WILL ACT AND WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT THE SAFE HARBOR RULE MIGHT APPLY IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY

CAUSE SOME ASSET TRANSFERS TO SECURITIZATION TRUSTS TO NO LONGER BE DEEMED ASSET SALES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES WITHIN A COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED GROUP, THE RATING AGENCIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY MAY ULTIMATELY CONCLUDE THAT THE SAFE HARBOR NO

LONGER APPLIES AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, THAT THE HIGHEST RATING AN ABS SECURITY COULD RECEIVE WOULD BE BASED ON THE SPONSORING BANKS UNSECURED DEBT RATING, RATHER THAN RELYING ON THEIR SEPARATE EVALUATION OF THE SECURITIZATION TRUST.

ACCORDINGLY, THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANYS SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS TO RECEIVE OR MAINTAIN AAA RATINGS ON ABS SECURITIES UNDER THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS IT HAS DONE IN THE PAST, OR AT ALL, IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY. ANY ACTION BY THE

RATING AGENCIES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO UTILIZE ABS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS BUSINESS.

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASES IN FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS.

FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS HAVE BECOME CONSIDERABLY HIGHER RECENTLY BECAUSE MARKET DEVELOPMENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DEPLETED THE FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND AND REDUCED THE RATIO OF RESERVES TO

INSURED DEPOSITS. THE FAILURE OF ADDITIONAL INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS COULD RESULT IN FURTHER DEPLETION OF THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND. ASSESSMENTS MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE, AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS MAY BE LEVIED, UNTIL THE VALUE OF THE FUND HAS

RETURNED TO LEVELS THE FDIC DETERMINES APPROPRIATE. WE GENERALLY CANNOT CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF PREMIUMS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR FDIC INSURANCE. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER, OR TO WHAT EXTENT, THE FDIC WILL INCREASE DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS

FURTHER OR WHETHER THE FDIC WILL LEVY ADDITIONAL SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. FURTHER INCREASE IN ASSESSMENTS, OR IMPOSITION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS, BY THE FDIC COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NEW REGULATION AND SUPERVISION TO WHICH WE

ARE SUBJECT AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2008, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AND

TRS EACH BECAME BANK HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT AND HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES UNDER THE BHC ACT. AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A BANK HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, INCLUDING,

WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL REGULATION AT THE HOLDING COMPANY LEVEL, MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TWO U.S. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR NON-BANKING ACTIVITIES UNDER

THE FEDERAL RESERVES REGULATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHANGE IN REGULATORY STATUS, PLEASE SEE SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONGENERAL BEGINNING ON PAGE 35 ABOVE.

IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR CAPITAL STOCK.

WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS BY OUR REGULATORS WHO COULD PROHIBIT A DIVIDEND THAT WOULD BE

CONSIDERED AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND BANKING PRACTICE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT BANK HOLDING COMPANIES SHOULD GENERALLY PAY DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK ONLY OUT OF EARNINGS, AND ONLY IF

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS RETENTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE NEEDS, ASSET QUALITY, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON BANK HOLDING COMPANY DIVIDEND

RESTRICTIONS, PLEASE SEE FINANCIAL REVIEWSHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS ON PAGE 40 AND NOTE 23 ON PAGE 119 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

BANKS, CARD ISSUERS AND CARD NETWORK OPERATORS GENERALLY ARE THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING GLOBAL REGULATORY FOCUS, WHICH MAY IMPOSE COSTLY NEW COMPLIANCE

BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY AND LEAD TO DECREASED TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND REVENUES THROUGH OUR NETWORK.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT BANKS AND THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ARE USED AND WHERE WE CONDUCT BANKING AND CARD ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AS A PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. REGULATION OF THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT

YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BANK SECRECY ACT AS AMENDED BY THE PATRIOT ACT, WITH REGARD TO MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROGRAMS. INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS IN THIS AREA COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL

OBLIGATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE MAY OFFER TO CONSUMERS, THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS MAY BE USED, AND THE TYPES OF CARDHOLDERS AND MERCHANTS WHO CAN OBTAIN OR ACCEPT OUR CHARGE

AND CREDIT CARDS. IN ADDITION, THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ADOPTED A NEW LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVE, CALLED THE PAYMENT SERVICES DIRECTIVE, FOR ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVICES, INCLUDING CARDS, THAT PUTS IN PLACE A COMMON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LICENSING AND

SUPERVISION OF PAYMENT SERVICES PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CARD ISSUERS AND MERCHANT ACQUIRERS, AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.

THE U.S. CONGRESS IS ALSO PRESENTLY CONSIDERING, OR MAY CONSIDER, LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES IN THE AREA OF INTERNET TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS INTERNET PRESCRIPTION DRUG PURCHASES AND COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT, AMONG OTHERS, THAT COULD

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE BURDENS ON OUR COMPANY. FEDERAL AND STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO CONTACTED PAYMENT COMPANIES CONCERNING THESE ISSUES. IF IMPLEMENTED, THESE INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO MONITOR, FILTER, RESTRICT, OR

OTHERWISE OVERSEE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, THEREBY INCREASING OUR COSTS OR DECREASING OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES AND LEGISLATURES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COVERING

IDENTITY THEFT, ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES, DISCLOSURE RULES, SECURITY, AND MARKETING THAT WOULD IMPACT US DIRECTLY, IN PART DUE TO INCREASED SCRUTINY OF OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS. THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE CHARGE

AND CREDIT CARDS OR PARTNER WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD DECREASE OUR TRANSACTION VOLUMES. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, NEW REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF CHARGE OR CREDIT

CARDS OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO OFFER EXISTING CARDS, SUCH AS STORED VALUE CARDS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND REVENUE GROWTH.

IN RECENT YEARS, REGULATORS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING INTERCHANGE FEES PAID TO CARD ISSUERS AND THE FEES

MERCHANTS ARE CHARGED TO ACCEPT CARDS. REGULATORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND, ITALY, SWITZERLAND, GERMANY, HUNGARY, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, AND VENEZUELA, AMONG OTHERS, HAVE CONDUCTED

INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE EITHER ONGOING OR ON APPEAL. THE INTERCHANGE FEE, WHICH IS THE COLLECTIVELY SET FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUING BANK IN FOUR PARTY PAYMENT NETWORKS, LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD, IS

GENERALLY THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE MERCHANT SERVICE CHARGE CHARGED TO MERCHANTS FOR BANKCARD DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. BY CONTRAST, THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK DOES NOT HAVE COLLECTIVELY SET INTERCHANGE FEES. ALTHOUGH

THE REGULATORS FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON VISA AND MASTERCARD AS THE DOMINANT CARD NETWORKS AND ON THEIR OPERATIONS ON A MULTILATERAL BASIS, ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE BANKCARD ASSOCIATIONS PRICING COULD

ULTIMATELY AFFECT ALL NETWORKS. LOWER INTERCHANGE AND/OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUE MAY LEAD CARD ISSUERS TO LOOK FOR OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE SUCH AS HIGHER ANNUAL CARD FEES OR INTEREST CHARGES, AS WELL AS TO REDUCE COSTS BY SCALING BACK OR

ELIMINATING REWARDS PROGRAMS.

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE UNITED STATES, CONGRESS CONTINUES TO DEBATE THE INTERCHANGE ISSUE. THERE HAVE BEEN

SEVERAL HEARINGS ON VISA/MASTERCARD INTERCHANGE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND IN 2009 AT THE REQUEST OF CONGRESS, THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE (GAO) COMPLETED A STUDY ON THE STRUCTURE OF INTERCHANGE FEES AND THEIR IMPACT ON CONSUMERS AND

MERCHANTS. THE REPORT PROVIDES A BALANCED VIEW OF THE INTERCHANGE ISSUE AND EXPLAINS HOW LARGE MERCHANTS WOULD BENEFIT AND HOW CONSUMERS COULD BE HARMED BY THE PENDING LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. IN 2009, LEGISLATION WAS REINTRODUCED IN CONGRESS THAT

WOULD GIVE ALL U.S. MERCHANTS ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO NEGOTIATE COLLECTIVELY THE PRICE AND TERMS OF CARD ACCEPTANCE ON NETWORKS. THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BILL COVERS NETWORKS WITH AT LEAST A 20% SHARE OF U.S. CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD PAYMENTS

COMBINED, WHICH WOULD NOT APPLY TO THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK BUT, IF ENACTED, WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON AMERICAN EXPRESS IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE SENATE VERSION OF THE BILL COVERS NETWORKS WITH AT LEAST 10% OF U.S. CREDIT OR DEBIT PAYMENTS, WHICH

WOULD APPLY TO AMERICAN EXPRESS. BOTH BILLS HAVE A DEFAULT PROCESS FOR HAVING PRICES AND TERMS SET THROUGH GOVERNMENT ACTION RATHER THAN COMPETITIVE FORCES. A SIMILAR VERSION OF THE HOUSE BILL (THE CREDIT CARD FAIR FEE ACT) WAS PASSED IN

THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN 2008. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN ON EITHER OF THESE BILLS IN 2009. THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE HELD A HEARING ON A THIRD PIECE OF INTERCHANGE-RELATED LEGISLATION THAT WAS REINTRODUCED IN 2009 (THE CREDIT

CARD INTERCHANGE FEES ACT), A BILL THAT WOULD REGULATE PAYMENT NETWORK RULES, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN ON THIS BILL. IT IS EXPECTED THAT CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS WILL CONTINUE IN 2010 ON THE INTERCHANGE

ISSUE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND VARIOUS FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS ON INTERCHANGE AND HAVE HELD SEVERAL CONFERENCES FOCUSED ON INTERCHANGE RATES. WHILE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN MONITORING THIS ISSUE,

IT HAS NOT INDICATED THE NEED TO REGULATE INTERCHANGE RATES IN THE UNITED STATES.

INCREASED REGULATORY FOCUS ON OUR COMPANY,

SUCH AS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MAY INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF TRANSACTIONS PROCESSED ON OUR NETWORKS OR MERCHANT DISCOUNT REVENUES FROM SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY

IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND INVEST SUCCESSFULLY IN, AND COMPETE AT

THE LEADING EDGE OF, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR BUSINESSES, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

OUR INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BUSINESS PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ACROSS ALL AREAS OF

OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING IN TRANSACTION PROCESSING, DATA MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS, PREPAID PRODUCTS, ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS. WE RELY IN PART

ON THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE EXPECT THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGE, AND THESE NEW

TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE SUPERIOR TO, OR RENDER OBSOLETE, THE TECHNOLOGIES WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR CARDS, NETWORKS AND OTHER SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP, ACQUIRE, OR ACCESS COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESS PROCESSES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS MAY BE

LIMITED BY PATENT RIGHTS THAT THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY ASSERT. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE DEVELOP MAY BE INHIBITED BY A NEED FOR INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS OR BY RESISTANCE FROM

CARDMEMBERS OR MERCHANTS TO SUCH CHANGES.

WE RELY ON A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND CONTROLS ON ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION. THESE MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND A RESULTING LOSS

OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, COMPETITORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY ALLEGE THAT OUR SYSTEMS, PROCESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. GIVEN THE COMPLEX, RAPIDLY CHANGING AND COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL AND

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED LITIGATION, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT A FUTURE ASSERTION OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST US WILL NOT CAUSE US TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT

REVENUES, INCUR SIGNIFICANT LICENSE, ROYALTY OR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, OR PAY SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES.

REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND DECREASE THE NUMBER

OF CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS ISSUED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY/BREACH, AND WE

COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THESE REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE DATA SECURITY RULE UNDER THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. THE DATA SECURITY RULE REQUIRES THAT EACH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT, AND

MAINTAIN A WRITTEN, COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM CONTAINING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND THE

SENSITIVITY OF ANY CUSTOMER INFORMATION AT ISSUE.

FURTHER, A GROWING NUMBER OF STATES, INCLUDING, NOTABLY, MASSACHUSETTS AND

NEVADA, HAVE ADOPTED BROAD-RANGING DATA SECURITY REGULATIONS REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE DATA THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COMPLIANCE AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT FINES AND PENALTIES

FOR NON-COMPLIANCE.

MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE ALSO EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THEIR DATA SECURITY

REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS, AS WELL AS INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA. IN 1995, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL PASSED EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 95/46/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND

ON THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SUCH DATA (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE), WHICH OBLIGATES THE CONTROLLER OF AN INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL DATA TO TAKE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT PERSONAL DATA. THE

DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL LAWS REGULATING DATA PROTECTION IN EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES. AS THESE LAWS EXPAND THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL PRESENCE, COMPLIANCE COSTS ARE

INCREASING, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING THAT ADEQUATE DATA PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND DATA TRANSFER MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE.

IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING ENHANCED DATA SECURITY REQUIREMENTS, VARIOUS FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND AS MANY AS 45 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO, AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAVE ENACTED DATA BREACH REGULATIONS AND

LAWS REQUIRING VARYING LEVELS OF CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY BREACH. DATA BREACH LAWS ARE ALSO BECOMING MORE PREVALENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE OPERATE, INCLUDING JAPAN, MEXICO AND GERMANY. IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT

HAVE YET TO IMPOSE AUTOMATIC DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY USED THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES BY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION AND DISCOURAGE DATA BREACHES.

MANY OF THESE REGULATIONS ALSO APPLY BROADLY TO RETAILERS/MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS; THUS, TO THE EXTENT THEY EXPERIENCE DATA SECURITY BREACHES, THIS PRESENTS ADDITIONAL RISKS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS AND OUR CARDMEMBERS. THE HEIGHTENED

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FOCUS ON DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY, INCLUDING REQUIRING CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF A DATA BREACH, CONTINUES. THE CURRENT 111TH CONGRESS WILL LIKELY CONSIDER DATA SECURITY/DATA BREACH LEGISLATION IN 2010 THAT, IF

IMPLEMENTED, COULD PRESENT NEW RISKS AND COSTS FOR US.

WE CONTINUE TO SEEK WAYS TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS AND COSTS INTERNALLY

BY IMPROVING OUR OWN DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICIES AND PRACTICES, AND EXTERNALLY THROUGH REGULAR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARD AND BY PLACING STRONG CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ON RETAILERS/MERCHANTS THAT ACCEPT OUR CARDS, AS WELL

AS ON OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS, RELATING TO DATA SECURITY AND DATA BREACH. STILL, INCREASED REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN THE AREAS OF DATA PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY/BREACH MAY MATERIALLY INCREASE OUR COSTS AND MAY

DECREASE THE NUMBER OF OUR CARDS THAT WE ISSUE, OR RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY EXPLOIT OUR CLOSED-LOOP CAPABILITY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY/BREACH LAWS

AND REGULATIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT COULD RESULT IN FINES, SANCTIONS, AND DAMAGE TO OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.

OUR

SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT

TEAM IS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RELATIVELY SMALL AND WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A CRITICAL PERIOD OF COMPETITION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PAYMENTS INDUSTRY. THE MARKET FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR CANDIDATES TO REPLACE OR SUCCEED MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM OR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONCOMPENSATION PRACTICES ON

PAGES 44-45, OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. AS A LARGE FINANCIAL AND BANKING INSTITUTION, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS ON COMPENSATION PRACTICES, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT OUR

COMPETITORS, BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE FDIC OR OTHER REGULATORS WORLDWIDE. THESE LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ANY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES, COULD FURTHER AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL. THE

LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT

FINES, PENALTIES AND/OR REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES.

BUSINESSES IN THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY HAVE

HISTORICALLY BEEN SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND PATENT CLAIMS. MANY OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS

ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AGENCIES IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES AND DAMAGE TO OUR

GLOBAL REPUTATION AND OUR BRAND.

BUSINESS RISKS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITION WORLDWIDE IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY.

THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCLUDES, IN ADDITION TO CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORKS, EVOLVING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS. WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST GENERAL-PURPOSE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD NETWORK BASED ON CHARGE VOLUME, BEHIND VISA AND MASTERCARD, WHICH ARE LARGER THAN WE ARE IN MOST MARKETS. AS A RESULT, OTHER CARD ISSUERS MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT

FROM THE STRONG POSITION AND MARKETING AND PRICING POWER OF VISA AND MASTERCARD. BECAUSE OF CONTINUING CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS BY MAJOR CARD ISSUERS, THERE ARE NOW A

SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUERS. CONTINUING CONSOLIDATION IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH US BEING ACQUIRED BY AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH A COMPETITOR,

RESULTING IN A POTENTIAL LOSS OF BUSINESS FOR US. THE LARGEST COMPETING ISSUERS HAVE CONTINUED TO GROW, IN SEVERAL CASES BY ACQUIRING CARD PORTFOLIOS, AND ALSO BY CROSS-SELLING THROUGH THEIR RETAIL BRANCH NETWORKS, AND COMPETITION AMONG ALL ISSUERS

REMAINS INTENSE. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS HAVE DEVELOPED, OR MAY DEVELOP, SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE, MAY OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE OFFER OR MAY USE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE

BROADER BRAND RECOGNITION OR MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE THAN WE HAVE. WE MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THESE THREATS.

OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAN WE ARE. SPENDING ON OUR CARDS COULD BE IMPACTED BY CONSUMER USAGE OF DEBIT CARDS, AS WE DO NOT

CURRENTLY ISSUE POINT-OF-SALE DEBIT CARDS FOR USE ON THE AMERICAN EXPRESS NETWORK. IN FACT, THE PURCHASE VOLUME AND NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH DEBIT CARDS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS GROWN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD TRANSACTIONS. IN

ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS AND SYSTEMS, SUCH AS AGGREGATORS, CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND IN THE ONLINE PAYMENTS SPACE, OUR MERCHANT REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS TRANSACTION DATA THROUGH OUR CLOSED-LOOP NETWORK

COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

REGULATORS HAVE RECENTLY PUT FORWARD VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES,

INCLUDING PROPOSALS RELATING TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE AND THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND PROPOSALS TO IMPOSE TAXES OR FEES ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE OR

SIMILAR PROPOSALS, WHICH MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS, COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE INCREASINGLY INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURE THAT MAY IMPACT THE PRICES WE CHARGE MERCHANTS WHO

ACCEPT OUR CARDS FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES.

UNLIKE OUR COMPETITORS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY THAT RELY ON HIGH

REVOLVING CREDIT BALANCES TO DRIVE PROFITS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON CARDMEMBER SPENDING. DISCOUNT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHEN CARDMEMBERS USE THEIR CARDS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK, IS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS VOLUMES AND IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE REVENUE SOURCE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN UNDER MARKET PRESSURE TO REDUCE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATES AND UNDERTAKE OTHER REPRICING INITIATIVES. THIS PRESSURE ARISES, IN PART, DUE

TO THE REGULATORY PRESSURE ON OUR COMPETITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS BEEN INCREASING. IF WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE MERCHANT DISCOUNT RATE WE CHARGE MERCHANTS OR ARE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN PREMIUM MERCHANT DISCOUNT

RATES ON OUR CARDS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING OVERALL VOLUME GROWTH OR AN INCREASE IN MERCHANT COVERAGE, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE CARD USAGE THROUGH OUR MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS OR TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE COSTS OF SUCH PROGRAMS, BOTH OF WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR

PROFITABILITY.

OUR BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE HIGH LEVEL OF SPENDING BY OUR CARDMEMBERS. INCREASING CONSUMER AND

BUSINESS SPENDING AND BORROWING ON OUR PAYMENT SERVICES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY CREDIT AND CHARGE CARDS AND TRAVELERS CHEQUES AND OTHER PREPAID PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN CARD LENDING BALANCES, DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE NEW OR

ENHANCED CARD AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND INCREASE REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS. ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS, REDUCE CARDMEMBER ATTRITION AND SEEK TO CAPTURE A GREATER SHARE OF CUSTOMERS TOTAL SPENDING ON CARDS ISSUED ON

OUR NETWORK, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, IS THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CARDMEMBER BENEFITS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND EXPAND CARDMEMBER BENEFITS, INCLUDING

CONTAINING THE GROWTH OF MARKETING, PROMOTION AND REWARDS EXPENSES AND CARDMEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, MANY CREDIT CARD ISSUERS HAVE INSTITUTED REWARDS AND CO-BRAND PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS, AND ISSUERS MAY IN THE FUTURE

INSTITUTE PROGRAMS THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO CARDMEMBERS THAN OUR PROGRAMS.

OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MARKETING,

PROMOTION AND REWARDS PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY, MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REPLACE THE PAYMENTS PROVIDED TO US UNDER OUR PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS WITH VISA AND MASTERCARD ONCE THE

AGGREGATE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL THROUGH THE FOURTH AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR BRAND AND

REPUTATION ARE KEY ASSETS OF OUR COMPANY, AND OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY HOW WE ARE PERCEIVED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

OUR BRAND AND ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE KEY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CONSUMER CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE EXTERNAL PERCEPTIONS OF OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE, TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUSINESS

PRACTICES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY REGARDING THESE MATTERS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AMONG EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CARDMEMBERS AND CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT NEW CARDMEMBERS

AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES. ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INDUSTRY MAY ALSO, BY ASSOCIATION, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN GREATER REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY OR LITIGATION AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH WE MONITOR

DEVELOPMENTS FOR AREAS OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND, NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OR PUBLICITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNT DATA BREACHES AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY USING OUR CARDS COULD LEAD TO REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND AND COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

WE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES STORE CARDMEMBER ACCOUNT INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHARGE AND CREDIT CARDS.

CRIMINALS ARE USING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED METHODS TO CAPTURE VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CARDMEMBERS ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ACCOUNTS, TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT. AS

OUTSOURCING AND SPECIALIZATION BECOME A MORE ACCEPTABLE AND COMMON WAY OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY, THERE ARE MORE THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS USING OUR CARDS. IF DATA BREACHES OR FRAUD LEVELS INVOLVING OUR CARDS

WERE TO RISE, IT COULD LEAD TO REGULATORY INTERVENTION

(SUCH AS MANDATORY CARD REISSUANCE) AND REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DAMAGE TO OUR BRAND, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CARDS, AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, THAT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND ALLIANCES OF OUR PARTNERS, AND THE POSSIBLE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR PARTNERS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS WE ENTER INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH BUSINESS

PARTNERS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH COSTCO AND DELTA AIR LINES TO OFFER CO-BRANDED CARDS FOR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH BUSINESSES IN MANY

INDUSTRIES, MOST NOTABLY THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, TO OFFER BENEFITS TO CARDMEMBER PARTICIPANTS. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS AND IN RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS

AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. IN ADDITION, UNDER SOME TYPES OF THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN CO-BRAND PARTNERS, MERCHANTS, VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS. IF WE

ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE COULD UNEXPECTEDLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THESE PARTNERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, WE HAVE CREDIT RISK TO

CERTAIN CO-BRAND PARTNERS RELATING TO OUR PREPAYMENTS FOR LOYALTY PROGRAM POINTS THAT WILL NOT BE FULLY REDEEMED FOR MULTI-YEAR PERIODS. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO RISK FROM BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS THAT MAY

OCCUR IN ANY INDUSTRY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BILLED BUSINESS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT PARTICULAR CARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (AND BILLED BUSINESS GENERALLY) AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,

WE COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE WERE OBLIGATED TO OR ELECTED TO REIMBURSE CARDMEMBERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PURCHASED FROM MERCHANTS THAT ARE BANKRUPT OR HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS.

THERE COULD BE CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, THROUGH MERGERS AND/OR GRANTS

OF ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO AIRLINE ALLIANCES AND JOINT VENTURES. THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS GRANTED ANTITRUST IMMUNITY TO MEMBERS OF THE SKYTEAM ALLIANCE AND THE STAR ALLIANCE, ENABLING THEM TO CLOSELY COORDINATE THEIR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TO LAUNCH HIGHLY INTEGRATED JOINT VENTURES IN TRANSATLANTIC AND OTHER MARKETS. THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS GRANTED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF A SIMILAR REQUEST BY MEMBERS OF THE ONEWORLD ALLIANCE FOR ANTITRUST

IMMUNITY. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS IMMUNITY PERMITS ALLIANCE MEMBERS TO JOINTLY PRICE AND MANAGE CAPACITY ON COVERED ROUTES, SHARE REVENUES AND COSTS, AND COORDINATE SALES AND CORPORATE CONTRACTS, OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS. THE

EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS REVIEW OF EACH OF THESE ALLIANCES IS CONTINUING. INCREASING CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANDED ANTITRUST IMMUNITY COULD CREATE CHALLENGES FOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AIRLINES INCLUDING BY REDUCING OUR PROFITABILITY ON OUR

AIRLINE BUSINESS. AIRLINES ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE PARTNERS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM. IF A PARTICIPATING AIRLINE MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN MEMBERSHIP REWARDS, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE

TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION. SIMILARLY, IF ONE OF OUR CO-BRAND AIRLINE PARTNERS MERGED WITH AN AIRLINE THAT HAD A COMPETING CO-BRAND CARD, THE COMBINED AIRLINE WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH CO-BRAND CARDS IT WOULD OFFER. IF

A SURVIVING AIRLINE DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW FROM MEMBERSHIP REWARDS OR TO CEASE OFFERING AN AMERICAN EXPRESS CO-BRAND CARD, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE AGREEMENTS WITH DELTA AND GENERAL RISKS

RELATED TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, SEE FINANCIAL REVIEWEXPOSURE TO AIRLINE INDUSTRY ON PAGE 60 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

OUR REENGINEERING AND OTHER COST CONTROL INITIATIVES MAY NOT PROVE SUCCESSFUL, AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE

INTENDED.

WE HAVE REGULARLY UNDERTAKEN, AND ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING, A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO REENGINEER OUR BUSINESS

OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS (INCLUDING THE REINVESTMENT OF SUCH SAVINGS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS MARKETING, PROMOTION, REWARDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE), ENHANCE REVENUE-GENERATING OPPORTUNITIES AND

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EXPENSE TO REVENUE RATIO BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AND OVER TIME. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE COST MANAGEMENT, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC MEASURES SUCH AS VENDOR, PROCESS, FACILITIES

AND OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATION, OUTSOURCING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, TECHNOLOGIES OPERATIONS), RELOCATING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS TO LOWER COST OVERSEAS LOCATIONS, MOVING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS TO THE INTERNET TO SAVE COSTS AND PLANNED

STAFF REDUCTIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF THESE REENGINEERING ACTIONS. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE THESE EFFORTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE EFFORTS, INCLUDING THE ABILITY OF THE GLOBAL SERVICES GROUP TO

GENERATE AN ANNUALIZED LEVEL OF GROSS EXPENSE SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION BY 2012, WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BENEFITS WE INTENDED. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CREDIT RISK RELATED TO CONSUMER DEBT, BUSINESS LOANS, SETTLEMENT RISK WITH REGARD TO GNS PARTNERS, MERCHANT

BANKRUPTCIES, THE RATE OF BANKRUPTCIES, AND OTHER CREDIT TRENDS THAT CAN AFFECT SPENDING ON CARD PRODUCTS, DEBT PAYMENTS BY INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ACCEPT OUR CARD PRODUCTS.

CREDIT RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT. WE ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CONSUMER CREDIT RISK, PRINCIPALLY FROM

CARDMEMBER RECEIVABLES AND OUR OTHER CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITIES, AND INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK FROM MERCHANTS, GNS PARTNERS AND GCC CLIENTS. THIRD PARTIES MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, OPERATIONAL

FAILURE OR OTHER REASONS. COUNTRY, REGIONAL AND POLITICAL RISKS ARE COMPONENTS OF CREDIT RISK. RISING DELINQUENCIES AND RISING RATES OF BANKRUPTCY ARE OFTEN PRECURSORS OF FUTURE WRITE-OFFS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

HIGHER WRITE-OFF RATES AND AN INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SECURITIZATIONS, AND MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF FUNDS.

ALTHOUGH WE MAKE ESTIMATES TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE

ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION WE USE IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. ALTHOUGH WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO SPECIFIC CLIENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES AND TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, COUNTRIES AND REGIONS THAT

WE BELIEVE MAY PRESENT CREDIT CONCERNS, DEFAULT RISK MAY ARISE FROM EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO FORESEE OR DETECT, SUCH AS FRAUD. WE MAY ALSO FAIL TO RECEIVE FULL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE MUST ALSO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE LOSS IN VALUE OF PORTFOLIOS

AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VARIABLES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM INTEREST RATES IN OUR CARD BUSINESS AND IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES AT WHICH WE BORROW AND LEND MONEY AFFECT THE

VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE RATE OF INTEREST WE PAY ON OUR BORROWINGS INCREASES MORE THAN THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR LOANS, OUR NET INTEREST YIELD, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR NET INCOME, COULD FALL.

WE MUST ALSO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT

READILY MARKETABLE.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. LIQUIDITY RISK IS

DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO ACCESS CASH AND EQUIVALENTS NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS AND SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK, WE MAY MAINTAIN TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY, WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND LIMIT

FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, OR WE MAY BE TOO ILLIQUID, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING A LIQUIDITY EVENT. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK, SEE ADVERSE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS MAY

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND COST OF CAPITAL ABOVE.

FINALLY, WE MUST

ALSO MANAGE THE OPERATIONAL RISKS TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED. WE CONSIDER OPERATIONAL RISK TO BE THE RISK OF NOT ACHIEVING OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES DUE TO FAILED PROCESSES, PEOPLE OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OR FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS NATURAL

DISASTERS. OPERATIONAL RISKS INCLUDE THE RISK THAT WE MAY NOT

79

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPLY WITH SPECIFIC REGULATORY OR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, EXPOSING US TO FINES AND/OR PENALTIES AND POSSIBLY BRAND DAMAGE; EMPLOYEE ERROR OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT THAT RESULTS IN A MATERIAL

FINANCIAL MISSTATEMENT; OR A FAILURE TO MONITOR AN OUTSOURCE PARTNERS COMPLIANCE WITH A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT, RESULTING IN ECONOMIC HARM TO US.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT

TECHNIQUES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE. SEE



FINANCIAL REVIEWRISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGES

47-49 OF OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE USE TO IDENTIFY, MONITOR AND

MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO RECORD PROPERLY AND VERIFY A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS, AND THESE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE.

AN INABILITY TO ACCEPT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND OR REGULATORY

CONSTRAINTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

AS AN

ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF FUNDING, OUR BANKING SUBSIDIARIES OFFER DEPOSITS TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGH BROKERAGE NETWORKS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $26.3 BILLION IN TOTAL CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, A LARGE PORTION OF WHICH WAS RAISED THROUGH BROKERAGE NETWORKS. MANY OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS ARE

INCREASING THEIR USE OF DEPOSIT FUNDING, AND AS SUCH WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE DEPOSIT MARKETS, PARTICULARLY AS TO BROKERAGE NETWORKS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW THIS INCREASED COMPETITION WILL AFFECT DEPOSIT RENEWAL RATES, COSTS OR

AVAILABILITY. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO OFFER HIGHER INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS, OUR FUNDING COSTS WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DEPOSIT FUNDING AND OFFER COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSITS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL LEVELS OF OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES. THE FDIA GENERALLY PROHIBITS A BANK, INCLUDING OUR

BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, FROM ACCEPTING BROKERED DEPOSITS OR OFFERING INTEREST RATES ON ANY DEPOSITS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PREVAILING RATE IN ITS NORMAL MARKET AREA OR NATIONALLY (DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE DEPOSITS ARE SOLICITED), UNLESS

(1) IT IS WELL-CAPITALIZED OR (2) IT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AND RECEIVES A WAIVER FROM THE FDIC. A BANK THAT IS ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED GENERALLY MAY NOT PAY AN INTEREST RATE ON ANY DEPOSIT, INCLUDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DEPOSITS, IN

EXCESS OF 75 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NATIONAL RATE PUBLISHED BY THE FDIC. THERE ARE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS ON A BANK THAT IS WELL-CAPITALIZED (PROVIDED SUCH BANK IS NOT SUBJECT TO A CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROVISION WITHIN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, CONSENT

ORDER, ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST, CAPITAL DIRECTIVE, OR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY ITS FEDERAL REGULATOR). WHILE WE MET THE FDICS DEFINITION OF WELL-CAPITALIZED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31,

2009, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THIS DEFINITION. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REGULATORS CAN ADJUST THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE WELL-CAPITALIZED AT ANY TIME AND HAVE AUTHORITY TO PLACE LIMITATIONS ON OUR DEPOSIT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING

THE INTEREST RATE WE PAY ON DEPOSITS. AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT OR MAINTAIN DEPOSITS IN THE FUTURE COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS.

IF OUR GLOBAL NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE DISRUPTED OR WE ARE UNABLE TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS EFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY WOULD BE

MATERIALLY REDUCED.

OUR TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS MAY EXPERIENCE SERVICE

INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER LOSS, DISRUPTIONS IN LONG DISTANCE OR LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACCESS, FRAUD, TERRORISM OR ACCIDENT. A NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER PROBLEM AT OUR FACILITIES COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES.

ADDITIONALLY, WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE TIMELY TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION ACROSS OUR GLOBAL NETWORK. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER FAILS TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNICATIONS CAPACITY OR SERVICES WE REQUIRE, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTER,

OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION, TERRORISM OR ANY OTHER REASON, THE FAILURE COULD INTERRUPT OUR SERVICES, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF OUR BRANDS RELIABILITY AND MATERIALLY REDUCE OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF VARIOUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES INTEGRAL TO THE

OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES. THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY ACT IN WAYS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE OPERATE A SERVICE

NETWORK AROUND THE WORLD. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE COST AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE OUTSOURCE TO THIRD-PARTY VENDORS MANY OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

OF THIS OUTSOURCING OCCURS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CERTAIN DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THAT THESE DECISIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE

MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS INCREASES OUR OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND DECREASES OUR CONTROL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE COST EFFICIENCIES OF CERTAIN OUTSOURCINGS WILL DECREASE AS THE DEMAND FOR THESE SERVICES INCREASES AROUND THE

WORLD.

COMPLEX KNOWN AS THE WORLD FINANCIAL CENTER. WE HAVE A 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. BROOKFIELD FINANCIAL PROPERTIES OWNS THE REMAINING 51% INTEREST IN THE BUILDING. WE ALSO LEASE SPACE IN THE BUILDING FROM BROOKFIELD.

OTHER OWNED OR LEASED PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS INCLUDE: THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICE CENTERS IN FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA; PHOENIX, ARIZONA;

GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA; AND SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH; THE AMERICAN EXPRESS DATA CENTERS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA AND IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA; THE AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCE CENTER IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA; THE HEADQUARTERS FOR AMERICAN EXPRESS SERVICES EUROPE

LIMITED IN LONDON, ENGLAND; THE AMEX CANADA INC. HEADQUARTERS IN MARKHAM, ONTARIO, CANADA; AND SERVICE CENTERS LOCATED IN MEXICO CITY, MEXICO; SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA; GURGAON, INDIA AND BRIGHTON, UNITED KINGDOM.

DURING 2004 AND 2005, WE ENGAGED IN SEVERAL SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE SOLD VARIOUS OWNED PROPERTIES TO THIRD PARTIES

AND LEASED BACK THE PROPERTIES UNDER LONG-TERM NET LEASES WHEREBY EACH AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITY THAT LEASES BACK THE PROPERTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, UTILITIES, OPERATING

EXPENSES AND INSURANCE COSTS) IN ADDITION TO ANNUAL RENT. THE SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS HAVE NOT MATERIALLY IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY YEAR. GAINS RESULTING FROM COMPLETED SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE INITIAL

TEN-YEAR LEASE PERIODS. WE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER WHETHER SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER PROPERTIES THAT WE CURRENTLY OWN.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, CONCERNING MATTERS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDUCT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS

MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO EACH OF THESE ACTIONS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY. IN THE COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS, INFORMATION GATHERING REQUESTS, SUBPOENAS, INQUIRIES

AND INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT A PARTY TO, NOR ARE ANY OF ITS PROPERTIES THE SUBJECT OF, ANY PENDING LEGAL, ARBITRATION, REGULATORY, TAX OR INVESTIGATIVE PROCEEDINGS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD AS THE PROCEEDINGS ARE RESOLVED.

CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE COMPANY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

CORPORATE MATTERS

BEGINNING IN MID-JULY 2002, 12 PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

OF NEW YORK. IN OCTOBER 2002, THESE CASES WERE CONSOLIDATED UNDER THE CAPTION

IN RE AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY SECURITIES LITIGATION

. THESE LAWSUITS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND THE COMMON LAW IN CONNECTION

WITH ALLEGED MISSTATEMENTS REGARDING CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN HIGH-YIELD BONDS AND WRITE-DOWNS IN THE 2000-2001 TIMEFRAME. THE PURPORTED CLASS COVERS THE PERIOD FROM JULY 26, 1999 TO JULY 17, 2001. THE ACTIONS SEEK UNSPECIFIED

COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AS WELL AS DISGORGEMENT, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS, AND INTEREST. ON MARCH 31, 2004, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE LAWSUIT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE DISMISSAL TO

THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. IN AUGUST 2006, THE COURT OF APPEALS, WITHOUT EXPRESSING ANY VIEWS WHATSOEVER ON THE MERITS OF THE CASES, VACATED THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT AND REMANDED ALL CLAIMS TO THE

DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ON JANUARY 5, 2007. THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT, WHICH MOTION WAS GRANTED IN SEPTEMBER 2008. PLAINTIFFS

HAVE APPEALED THE DISMISSAL.

ON NOVEMBER 24, 2009, A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED

AMICK V. AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL
